Apple is reportedly working on a significant redesign of the iPhone for the 2017 model that will not include a home button, reports Bloomberg. This will allow Apple to focus more on the display, which is said to have a curved design similar to that of Samsung’s newer smartphones, according to Nikkei Asian Review. Blog Apple Insider also reported last year that Apple is working on an iPhone without a home button. Removing the home button would be a crucial move for Apple, considering it has functioned as the portal to technologies like TouchID, Apple Pay, and Siri. Still, many modern Android phones have axed the physical home button to allow for larger screens. These phones instead have navigational keys baked into their software or touch-sensitive sensors that sit on the bezel. Next year’s model is expected to represent a major redesign of the iPhone, while this year’s version is said to be more of an incremental update. Apple has released its iPhones on a tick-tock pattern in recent years, and this year’s iPhone 7 launch is expected to be the first departure from that schedule, according to The Wall Street Journal. Every other year, Apple typically introduces a major overhaul of the iPhone, while the models in between iterate on the iPhone’s current form factor. The iPhone 6, for instance, represented a complete redesign of the iPhone compared to the 5 and 5s models, while the iPhone 6s kept that same design but added some new features, like 3D Touch. The overhaul reportedly coming in 2017 will mark 10 years since the original iPhone launched in 2007. Apple declined TIME’s request for comment.

What is disturbing is that hackers who get hold of these information virtually give it for free. (Photo : Gavin Roberts/Tap Magazine via Getty Images) A selection of accessories for Apple iOS devices photographed during a studio shoot for Tap Magazine, November 13, 2012.   Tech giant Apple was also a victim of spyware. Apple took a fast step in defeating these spyware flaws by releasing a security update. Users can relax now as this update from Apple will not allow any of the Apple devices to be accessed by hackers. According to USAToday, the espionage software was discovered by Ahmed Mansoor, a prominent United Arab Emirates dissident, received a text message which invited him to click on a Web link on his iPhone 6. Ahmed Mansoor had been a victim in past and he cheated out the hackers by sending this link to University of Toronto's Citizen Lab. Researcher worked out with San Francisco based mobile security firm Lookout and found that a "sophisticated, targeted, and persistent mobile attack on iOS using three zero-day vulnerabilities we call 'Trident", which some have valued up to $1million. Andrew Blaich, a staff researcher at Lookout said "As security breaches go, this is fairly serious, considering how fast Apple addressed it" The spyware attack through the link will break into an iOS device and spy on information of the victim pertaining to Facebook, emails, calendars or any other important stuff in the device. Apple's extremely fast step in releasing security update helps the users to keep their device safe from spywares. Apple's support released the link on how to download the security update -support-apple. According to Fox News, Mansoor in an interview in downtown Ajman, United Arab Emirates said "It feels really good," and he added that developments "could save hundreds of people from being targets." The spyware texts were shown to the associated press in Ajman. Citizen Lab and Lookout released two reports stating that how a tap of finger on a web link would have made hackers access to Ahmed Mansoor's mobile data. It would have given the hacker's free reign to eavesdrop on calls, harvest messages, activate camera and drain the phone's trove of personal data. A strong step from Emirati dissident helped Apple to take rapid step to ensure the security of the Apple devices.     Share ( 0 ) Tweet ( 0 ) TAGSapple, iphone, hackers, spyware Copyright © 2016 News Everyday Related Articles Medical 'Marijuana' Has A New Form And This Time It Is Without The High, What We ...

According to reports from Lookout and Citizen Lab, these “issues” are three iOS zero-days used to spy on political dissidents all over the world. The two security company think that the zero-days are a part of the Pegasus software suite. The suite was created by the Israel-based firm, NSO Group, and then sold to governments around the world which used it against targets of interest. Even though Pegasus is referred to as a surveillance software developed for law enforcement agencies, it doesn’t differ from a spying software, available on the underground cyber marked and used by crooks for malicious purposes. NSO`s Pegasus has been around for many years now, but more popular and powerful rivals have always overshadowed it. For instance, the HackingTeam which developed and sells the RCS surveillance package or the Gamma Group and its FinFisher product. Apple released a fix yesterday to address Pegasus features that allowed it to spy on iOS users without them realizing. Powered by three zero-days, the features give crooks the opportunity to take over an iOS device by tricking users to load a malicious webpage. When the zero-day exploit code is executed on the targeted device, the hacker would be able to use the Pegasus software for gaining complete control over Apple devices. They could overhear conversations via the mic, see where the user is located, exfiltrate data, follow IM conversations, etc., Lookout says. “Pegasus is the most sophisticated attack we’ve seen on any endpoint because it takes advantage of how integrated mobile devices are in our lives and the combination of features only available on mobile.”– explains the Lookout team. Moreover, a deeper Pegasus analysis revealed a concerning discovery. Researchers have found traces of a kernel mapping table that has values that target previous iOS version, way back to iOS 7. This means that the spyware was active under the radar for years before finally being detected a month ago. One of Pegasus`s main victims was Ahmed Mansoor. Mansoor is a human rights activist from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and he was the one suspect something was wrong which led to the discovery of the three zero-days. Mansoor is considered to the one of the most spied on activists in the world. As he had been previously targeted by both RSC spyware and FinFisher, it didn’t take him long to recognize a phishing lure sent to him via SMS, promising new details about torture practices in the UAE. He immediately informed the Canadian investigative interdisciplinary laboratory, which specializes in political cyber-espionage, Citizen Lab. Citizen Lab included the Lookout company in the investigation to analyze the attack`s technical side. Lookout was the one to find the three zero-days and Citizen Lab managed to find the connection between them and the NSO Group`s Pegasus software. Citizen Lab found out Pegasus`s export licenses for several governments. Then, Pegasus was linked to other attacks, including the one against a Mexican journalist who uncovered corruption by Mexico’s President, and a couple of attacks in Kenya, whose targets are unknown. “While these spyware tools are developed in democracies, they continue to be sold to countries with notorious records of abusive targeting of human rights defenders.” – the Citizen Lab team says -“Such sales occur despite the existence of applicable export controls.” SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Simona Atanasova http://virusguides.com Simona has graduated First language school - Varna, Bulgaria with a main focus on English philology.

Yesterday he got through a three-hour practice in good shape.  Q: What do you see from him, do you see flashes? More than flashes? Do you want to see more? What do you see? A: Yeah, when he first got out here this week, he showed a burst and showed some acceleration, he can put his foot in the ground. He had a really nice release on a slant, which reminded me of the Houston game a few of years ago, so it is encouraging.  Q: Do you think he looked better the last couple of days than he did earlier in camp?  A: He had flashes early in the camp, too. I wouldn’t say he looked better, I just think he looked good.  Q: Will he play with the first group for the same length of time as they play or do you have a different plan for him?  A: We will put him out there early in the game.  Q: What are you hoping to see from him? What is important for you to see in the preseason from him? A: I would love to see him get his hands on a football and make some plays for us  Q: Ben, have you gone back to 2011 or any of the earlier days when you weren’t here to see the best of him or would that not be something that you would be interested in?  A: No, I saw enough of him in 2011, especially in that divisional playoff round.  Q: Are the starters going to play through the first half and into the third quarter?  A: As a general proposition, we would like to take our starters into early in the third quarter. We will evaluate it at halftime and see how it goes and then different guys based off of where they are physically. We may give a little bit more or give a little bit less, too.  Q: Is Cruz a guy who fits into that less category?  A: We will evaluate it  Q: How have you challenged your group this week?  A: We talked a little bit after the game and some emotions were flying around and we put it in perspective earlier in the week. We challenged them with the workload yesterday and coming out with the pads on and being in the pads for three hours with some conditioning and throwing a lot of situations at them. They responded in practice.  Q: Ben, we know how generally the unofficial rule is the starters play the most in the third preseason game and then in the fourth, a lot of times people don't even put their starters in at all. Are you even looking ahead to how you are going to break it up over two weeks or have you even figured that out yet?  A: Yeah, we have a plan in place for the third and fourth preseason games, but you have to be able to adjust and improvise with the way things go.  Q: What is your Friday practice? What do you look to get out of the guys? A: Fresh Friday. We try and challenge them in as many ways as we can between the ears and keep it simple from the waist down.  Q: Do you get on the field though?  A: Yes.  Q: For how long usually? Or is there a set amount of time?  A: We get out there and go through, we play the game before we play the game on Fridays. Q: How about tomorrow?  A: Yeah, tomorrow is launch day for us. We try to launch and rev them up and get the speed going 80 percent or so and get everything functioning again and get it firing and get ready for the game day.  Q: Ben, do you expect Eli Apple to play Saturday? A: Yes. Q: What about Justin Pugh?  A: We will see. Q: Has Apple shown you everything that you guys knew about him when you took him in the first round?  A: He is just getting back out there right now. He has had a little bit of a layoff there, he has been nicked so I have not seen much of him recently. It looks like he is chomping at the bit to get back out there.  Q: When could Darian Thompson get back on the practice field?  A: We are evaluating him. We say week-to-week, but to me it's hour-to-hour. I know the game is very important to the young man and he wants to be out there and help his teammates and contribute. He is getting as many mental reps as he can right now. That part of it is important to him, but we will take a look at him next week, too.  Q: Is he doing better? Is he improving this week?  A: Yes. Q: How would you describe your dynamic with Eli Manning and why it facilitates a successful offense that can move the ball?  A: My dynamic?  Q: Yeah, I guess what is unique about him, working with him as a quarterback and as a leader of the offence  A: Eli is very steady. He is a great guy to work with in the room. He gives you honest feedback and enjoys being a part of the process and part of the plan. He is just Steady Eddie.  Q: Do you work with him less now that your role has changed?  A: My role has changed, but I am in the quarterback meetings  Q: How are you going to handle the kickers on Saturday and the next two preseason games now that it is a competition?  A: They will both get work  Q: Is Geremy Davis going to suit up Saturday?  A: He is working to get out there.  Q: Do you sense that the offensive line thinks it is important to put a better product on the field Saturday night?  A: I think the offence as a whole feels that it is important to put a better product on the field  WR Victor Cruz Q: How ready are you for Saturday night? A: I’m ready. Obviously it’s been a long time coming. I had a good week of practice, everything feels great so I’m just excited to put that out there on the game field for the first time in a long time. Q: Do you have some sort of count in your head? Do you know how long it’s been? A: No, but you guys do a good job of detailing that on my social media channels, so I get a grasp of it. I don’t necessarily look it up in my head. I just look forward to tomorrow and being better than I was the day before. Q: Does it feel like an eternity? A: For lack of better words, yes. It feels like a long time since I’ve been out there. Last week was kind of fun for me to dress up and obviously not play but to warmup with my team, put that jersey on again and feel like an athlete again. It was a good feeling and now it comes to life. Q: We think of it sometimes as “just a preseason game.” Is this more than just a preseason game for you? A: Absolutely. I think this one is more of just the game. This one is crossing so many hurdles, so many barriers. So many ups and downs that I had to face to get to this moment. Now, I’m just ready to relax and go play some football again. To me, this game is bigger than just the game. Although it’s just a preseason game, for me, mentally and emotionally, physically, it’s more than just a football game. Q: Is it interesting to you that it comes against the Jets, which is a team that you’ve had some history with? A: It’s the story of my life. You can’t write it any better than this. This is the way my career has gone. It’s the way my professional career has gone. The Jets preseason game has always been some type of landmark situation for me, so here we go again. Q: Is it fair to say that the butterflies, anticipation and excitement will make you feel like a rookie again? A: I don’t think I feel like a rookie again, I can tell you that. There will be butterflies, there will be anxiety, there has been for some time now. Those feelings will all be back obviously. I get butterflies before every game until that ball is kicked off and until we’re playing. That’s when everything kind of settles down and I can hone in on what I’m doing. This week will be no different. Q: Do you have to prove anything to yourself in this game? A: Not necessarily. I think I proved a lot to myself on the practice field. Just being able to come out here and play, run routes and come out unscathed and feel good the next day. That’s what I really wanted to prove. Obviously this game is more for me to get hit, have that opportunity to get that game rep, have those game-like actions with Eli, being on the same page, all those things that you look forward to as a player. Q: How pleased were you with this week’s practice? You said you were waiting for that moment, did that come this week? A: I think it came a couple times. It felt good. It felt like myself. It felt like what I was used to doing and how I was used to playing. I think a couple moments came and I was excited about it. I just want to continue to stack those moments and stack those personal victories. Q: What was that like in Buffalo, going on the field for warmups knowing you weren’t going to play? It had to be difficult? A: A little bit. It’s been awhile since I even dressed up and got out there and warmed up. I was happy to be out there with my teammates and having them cheer me on. It was like, ‘Okay, one step closer, 80.’ Everyone just on my side and rooting for me was a great feeling. Just to be out there was the best part. Whether I was playing or not, going to be in that game or not, being out there going through the warmup with my team was definitely a step in the right direction. Q: Did you see Rex Ryan at all? A: I did. He came out to me during that warmup. He was like, ‘Good to see you. I know you’re not going today, but get healthy and we’ll see you throughout the year.’ We’ve always had a mutual respect for each other over the years. It was good to see him again. Q: You’ve been close to this point a couple times and it hasn’t worked out. When you finished practice yesterday, having the big heavy part of the week gone by and you were finished, was there a sense of relief that this was going to happen now? A: A little bit. Obviously there was a little bit of an exhale once that practice was over. I was like, ‘Okay, I finished this week strong and not going backwards. Everything is going forwards and I’m moving in the right direction.’ That was a good feeling and a tremendous exhale that I was one step closer to getting back out there on the field in a game-like atmosphere and playing with my teammates again. Q: You’ve had two heavy practices. Were you able to go back and look at it and watch it. What is your critique? Where do you think you need to get better? A: I think it’s continuing to get a feel for the routes, the route combinations, the spacing. Continuing to work on catching the football, being explosive, continuing to catch the ball, running after the catch. Just getting that consistency back is the last part of it now. Understanding what I’m getting out there on the field from a coverage perspective and then working backwards from there. Everything is going in the right direction, I just want to continue to stack and build on that. Q: Mike Sullivan said he watched you this week and had visions of 2011, watching tape. Did you? A: I did. Some of those moments I spoke about earlier about things that I wanted to see in myself, they were out there on that football field. Some of that quickness and some of that elusiveness that I felt was definitely out there. I just want to continue to build on that. Like I said, it’s one thing to do it one day but to continue to do it everyday and be consistent is what you want. I think I built a good foundation to continue to move in the right direction. Q: Given the stops and starts of this whole process, was there a level of anxiety that you had coming into the week practice-wise and were you concerned that things might have been set back again? A: Of course. The anxiety to come out, the training staff told me I was full go. If I had any limitations, they wanted me to let them know. Obviously I know my body after all this time that has passed. I was positive, I got a text from a friend of mine that said just go out there and have fun. I said that’s how I’m going to approach it. I came out, I was smiling, I was running around, having a good time. I think that was the thing that tipped the ice burg for me. Here I am and I’m ready to play. Q: Was that right before practice you got that text? A: About an hour before practice. Q: Care to say who sent it? A: Not Lebron. QB Eli Manning Q: Any early impressions of what you saw from number 80 out there? A: I thought Victor had a good week of practice. It was good to have him back. He looked explosive, fast and healthy. He was making plays. That little rest he got paid off and it’s good to see him. Excited to see him on a game day and to see him in some live action. Q: Did you make an effort to feed him in practice this week at all? A: No, just going through my reads and trying to stick with what I normally do. Having faith with all the guys who are out there, whoever is running routes and just sticking with the progression I’ve been taught to do. It seems like he got a few opportunities to make some plays so that’s good. Q: Especially with him inside running those routes that he’s been running, is there something to be said about being at the right place at the right time and being where you’re supposed to be that makes it more fluent for you guys? It seemed like that at the practice that we saw on Tuesday and that seemed to get him going. A: Yes, obviously in football a lot of it is just having the right routes against the right coverages and the right timing. I think he’s had a good understanding of the timing of this offense and when the ball is going to be coming his way. He’s always been a special guy in the slot just having a good feel. Giving sticks and it’s been easy for me to read his body language when he’s coming in and out of breaks. It’s good that we still have that. Q: What do you recall about his famous night against the Jets in 2011 when he caught three touchdowns? A: I think I was getting stitches in my head. I think I missed a lot of it. I saw a few of it on TV in the locker room. I saw it in the game film and he made plays. I know he had a fade down the left sideline, made a one-handed catch, had a back shoulder catch, a couple that were fade routes. Obviously a big part of him making the team was that night, stepping up and making plays. Q: He was number three back then? A: He was. It was Victor Cruz before anyone even knew who Victor Cruz was. He made a name for himself that night. Q: How about the 99-yard catch and run? What do you recall about that? A: Great play. We were backed up on the one-yard line, end of the second quarter. Just did a little out route to him versus a two zone. Tight throw, he ran a great route, caught it while feeling the cornerback, was able to side-step him, show his speed and get a 99-yard touchdown. A huge play for us winning that game and making the playoffs that year that led to a Super Bowl. Q: We know you’re always so calm but do you allow yourself to get anxious and butterflies for a teammate like Victor? I’m sure you’re anticipating the eagerness of wanting to throw him a pass and getting that completion out of the way. A: I don’t think it’s nervous or anxious. I’m excited for him. He’s a long time teammate and friend. I know what he’s been through and I know it’s been a tough road these last two years. I know he wants to be out there so I’m excited for him to have that possibility. Obviously it’s preseason, it would be nice to get him out there but when it comes to the regular season to get him some action, some catches, a touchdown, that would be special. Q: Has his footwork in practice, those quick moves, stood out to you more this week? A: I think it’s been a while since he’s had to move around like that. I think those are things that have always probably come really natural to him. He just has to get used to doing it again. He has to get used to catching the ball, making that first defender miss, where he’s not thinking about anything. Just thinking about catching it and acting normal. It’s what he naturally does. I think it takes a little time to trust it and realize that he’s still got it, but it seems like he’s moving that way. Q: Do you look at trying to get him the ball early? Maybe look at him a little bit more because you’re trying to get him action, trying to see what he can do? A: It doesn’t always work that way. Hopefully it works out and we can get him the ball, but it’ll depend on the coverage, on the play, and what’s going on. I’m not going to bypass somebody to get him a catch in a preseason game. Hopefully it works out, and if he’s out there enough he should get a catch. Q: How have you guys balanced this week, not freaking out over the past two preseason games but having an urgency to get things right for the third preseason game? A: Our focus has been on this week. We understand that this has been about as close as our game week schedule will be. The game planning, from the practice schedule, and everything that’s going on. I thought we had a good week of practice, a good urgency. The tempo was better, fixing things and cleaning up things. The practice was better. We just have to put the practice onto the field. We have to do it on game day and make the plays when they count. Q: What will a healthy Victor Cruz do for you and this offense? A: He’s a talented player. If he can get healthy it gives us another playmaker and a guy that can play the outside and the inside. When you have receivers that can play multiple, like Victor, like Odell, like Sterling, you can move guys around and it’s harder to game plan for certain teams. We’re going to try and be versatile with that and having him be part of that action. Having a guy you can trust and have that chemistry with is important. DT Damon Harrison Q: How much do you hate the Jets? A: I don't hate them at all, I don't hate too many teams in the league. It's just a game, it'll be fun to get out there and play with my former teammates and some guys I consider family. Q: Does it help at all that it's a preseason game? A: No, I kind of hate that it's a preseason game. Because, again, all games count, preseason or not but it would be that much more fun and exciting if it was a regular season game and if it was a year ago. Q: How much communication have you had with your former teammates leading up to this game? A: Well the D-line, we talk, I'm going to say every other day; Muhammad (Wilkerson), Sheldon (Richardson), Leonard (Williams), T.J. Barnes, Stephen Bowen. I'm sure it would be more if we weren't in camp but I talk to those guys all time, not only the D-line but a lot of the guys on offense and defense. Q: Have they been razzing you about the game? A: I told them we're just going to leave that for Saturday, whenever it is, I think it's Saturday. I told them I was going to leave it there so let’s just not talk about it now. Q: How does this defensive line and the defensive room here compare to that one? A: Oh man, I really can’t get into comparisons, it's really not fair to either side to even do that. These guys, I'm just still getting to know them so it wouldn't be right for me to formulate a solid opinion on them yet, but so far so good. Q: When you're on the field, who's voice are you hearing most behind you? A: Well it's been different because the linebacker rotation it's been changing a lot; I guess they're still trying to figure some things out. But, Jasper (Brinkley), JC (Jonathan Casillas) and JT (Thomas). Those are the consistent voices I hear. Q: Wasn't that long ago that you admitted that you don't feel like a Giant, there’s still some Jet blood in you...You’ve kind of indicated that it's still an adjustment for you, is it still that way? A:  Well I mean, I played a few games as a Giant since that comment, I would like to think. Yeah, it's coming along nicely. Again, it's still different, I'm a guy, I don't like change at all, I like consistency, I like everything to be the same every single day. I definitely have been embracing it a whole lot more now. Q: I know you guys have done some game planning for them, how different is it to not have to go after Ivory in the backfield? A: Forte is a good back, he's an older back but he’s still a really good back. But I'll tell you, the funny thing is just to watch your former team on the field and watch the guys you're going up against and spoke to everyday for the past four years. That's been weird, and you know, to actually hear opinions from other teams and what they think about guys, that's funny man. That's real funny. Q: Does it reinforce your opinions or change your opinions of those guys? A: It reinforces it, because sometime it's spot on. Like I asked one coach today 'how did you know?' and he told me but I don't want to get too deep into that but yeah they're right. Q: You've been in both locker rooms now, is there any rivalry left between the Giants and the Jets? If so, how does it manifest itself? A: I wouldn't call it a rivalry; I think it’s more for the fans. And you know, a respect thing around the town, seeing each other out, the Giants and the Jets but as far as Cowboys-Giants and Jets-Patriots, it's not that kind of rivalry Q: Was this game a bigger deal when Rex Ryan was around? A: Everything was a big deal. Everything. He made you believe that every game, every snap, everything mattered, as do a lot of coaches. But it was just a little different with Rex, and he wanted the Snoopy Bowl more than some others. Q: You practiced against this offensive line before, have you ever gone full speed against them? A: Against our O line? Q: Against the Jets. A: Yes, I'm a big guy so I wouldn't consider it full speed but yes, in training camp definitely, and during the season we had on shoulder pads quite a bit during my time there, even into the season. Q: Do you know what to expect from them? A: Oh yeah, you want me to tell you more? Q: Who are you looking forward to going against? A: I'm excited to see everybody, but the entire O-line. It'll be fun to have on a different jersey and go up against them. It'll be weird at first, but hopefully Mangold gets to play, because we've always had some good battles. He's still one of the better centers in the league and you know that'll be the last time before his last preseason game. Q: Have you guys talked about bringing the Snoopy Trophy back? A: No, I couldn't remember the name of it until somebody just told me. So, it's not that big of a deal. It is for the fans so we care about it. Wide Receivers Coach Adam Henry Q: What have you seen from Victor in the past couple of days? A: I've seen progress with Victor. It's going along, slowly but surely. So just taking our time with him. But I'm optimistic. Q: You're one of the few guys here who's never worked with him before this year. Is that difficult, or do you get a new perspective? A: No. I look at each situation totally different. It doesn't matter if I haven't worked with him. I consider myself a coach, so coaching different players that do different things. But the transition has been really, really good. For him, as a person, he's a hard worker, he wants to learn, he's doing all the things he needs to do to be successful.  Q: What have you learned from Victor, not just as a receiver but as a person? A: Just as a person, he has many talents. He likes to do a lot of other things besides being a football player. But he is a good person. Q: When you see a veteran with the kind of summer that he's had, with the ups and downs, do you find a way to get through to him? How’s the last couple of weeks been with him one on one? A: Always. I'm always going to be optimistic, I'm always going to be positive. That's just who I am, and the type of coach that I am. So I'm always there for him, just talking to him, whether it's football or not football. But he's always been upbeat, always been positive about the situation. Just taking it slowly with him. But as far as the mental aspect, you can see him growing as a person, as a player. Mentally, he's in a good place.  Q: Does Sterling seem more like a rookie, or less like a rookie? A: He's got a ways to go. There are a lot of learning curves, situationally smart in an NFL game. Again, he works hard, that's the biggest thing that you want from a player. He's out there, he likes to have fun, he's smiling, he loves to work. When you hold him out of plays, he gets upset. So, those are the things that you look for in players. Q: Who gets more upset when you hold them out of plays, him or Odell? A: Both. It's different. So they compete, and so what we try to instill is just positive peer pressure, then a room of making plays and being a playmaker and working hard, finishing plays and things of that nature. That's the collective group was taking ownership of that group and just working hard. Q: You've coached Odell in the past, and now you're coaching him here. How different is this Odell then the player that you coached at LSU? A: He's a little different. Of course, New York, the media. It's just things are different. There are receivers that I've coached at LSU that are at some other places, so he's different because of the NFL and the things he's done so far. So of course, he's grown as a person. At LSU, everything was so enclosed, and being in college, going to class or back. Even though, LSU football is a big deal, it was just a little different. Q: Different in a positive way or a negative way? A: It's just the media. It's just, it's expounded. A lot of the plays that he did at LSU and making plays, he's always done that.  Q: LeBron was not in contact with him? A: That's a little different. But again, he works hard. He's one of the hardest workers in the group. He's doing everything that we ask of him as a staff.  Q: What has Tavarres King done to separate himself? A: He's been consistent, making plays down the field. Just each and every day, just working on his craft. I've seen some good things from him. Q: What about Roger Lewis Jr, how much progress has he made and where do see him at this point? A: He's making progress every day and again he's a hard worker. He's willing to learn, he's always with the other quarterbacks, asking questions. He asks a lot of questions; he writes a lot of notes down. Just in translating the things in his brain, and what he needs to do. From a player point of view, from the first day, he’s really grown, he's progressed. Q: Did he start at a lower point; he came from a different kind of offense- more college? A: The college game is different. So it's the situations, because a rep is like a bar of gold. So when you have an ability to get in there and get a rep, and to learn, it's a learning curve. Again, because of the offenses in college and the style of going fast and things of that nature, it’s just different. Q: With your receivers, how interchangeable do they have to be or how interchangeable are they now? A: They're all interchangeable; just play receiver. So, that’s the thing, it's just learning the concept, the conception of how a play is unfolded. Not just learning a certain position. You always want to put yourself in a position to play that next best player. So as far as the X receiver or Z receiver, we just have receivers and so they're interchangeable. Of course we need to put them in spots to be successful. Secondary/Safeties Coach Dave Merritt Q: How disappointing is it that Darian (Thompson) has to miss a game? A: Very disappointing. I feel sad for the young man. He has been doing well for us as far as communicating and controlling the coverages on the back end, so for him to miss a game, he was definitely upset. Q: Do you think this derails him, or do you envision him still ready to start the season? A: Oh, he will be ready. He will be ready. My thing is, I told the young man, ‘You are a young fella, you should heal well, if you were my age you would be out for six months’, but by him being young, I truly believe that he will be ready to go. He is in there taking notes and has continued to try to help all the other guys in the room as far as the game plan and etc. So I don’t think it derails him at all. Q: What has he shown that has made him able to seize the starting job basically from day one? A: The assertiveness. This kid has come in from day one, he’s been able to go out and receive the calls that would come into the huddle and he is able to go out and actually execute it and just being very firm with his calls whether he is right or wrong. That is the one thing that he has shown from day one, is just being assertive and making a call and sticking to it. Q: Have you seen the kind of jump from Landon that you were looking for in year two? A: Absolutely. So far, Landon has been a breath of fresh air versus the young man from last year because he understands the defense a little more being in his second year, so he is communicating, he is taking charge out there as well as Darian, so I am very happy with Landon and where he is mentally. Q: He looks faster. How much of that is physically better conditioning and how much of that is knowing what he is doing? A: I think it is the second part that you said, knowing what he is doing because of course if you know what you are doing, you are going to actually be able to play faster. You are not going to be mentally constipated and the fact that he is able to go out and just as Darian, being able to receive the call and actually executing and knowing what he is doing, he is playing much faster. Another thing is Landon is taking care of his body. I think he is down to seven percent body fat. Don’t quote me on that, but I told him, ‘If you want to become one of the elite safeties in the league you are going to have to at least get between 212 and 216.’ He texted me this morning, it is funny and he said, ‘Coach, I am at 216’, I said, ‘Great. Keep it up.’ Q: What weight was he at last year? A: I can’t recall exactly where he was, but I am quite sure that he was heavier than 216. Q: There was so much about Landon being a box safety last year. I am curious, has that remaking of his body helped him in coverage or has the knowledge has helped as much as anything? A: I think it is both. I think the fact that just talking about as far as his body --- I think, being able to play at a lighter weight has allowed him to have his change of direction more so than when you are heavy you are trying to plant and drive. It is with any athlete. The more weight that you are carrying and you are trying to plant and drive it is going to be tough for that particular athlete to get in and out of cuts. There are some elite guys that can actually do it, but I think the fact that he trimmed some of his body fat, like I said, down to seven percent body fat. That is pretty dag on good for a 215, 16, 18-pound man. But, then again, just as was mentioned earlier, just his mental --- being able to know what to do and do it quickly and do it decisively is ahead of the ball game. If you can get that done before the snap actually happens and you understand formation and recognizing what they are actually trying to do to you, that is going to give you a jump start for sure. Q: If Darian can’t go against the Cowboys, do you know right now who would fill in? A: I have no clue. The thing is, the Nat Berhe’s and all the guys that we have are ready to go, they have all been tested, each guy, so I really don’t know right now. I couldn’t answer that question. Q: Do you feel that if Darian is able to get onto the field you are going to have any nerves about throwing a rookie out there? A: Not at all. Landon went through it last year. Not at all. Landon came in last year as a second round pick and he had to start and he started every game, so not at all. I don’t feel squeamish at all about starting a young guy. The best players are going to play and right now, if he is the best player which he has stepped up and he has taken the bull by the horn, he is ready to go. We have all the confidence in the world that he will be our guy ready to go on opening day. Q: Eli Apple seems pretty even keeled for a rookie. What is it about him? Does he come off more mature? What have you learned about him so far? A: It is actually biblical. If you don’t say much, if you just kind of sit back and just let it go and look at what is going on and watch the other guys, sometimes you may seem smarter than actually what you really are, so the thing is, Eli hasn’t said much, but he is watching the veterans and he is actually learning from what they are trying to teach him. So maybe that is what you are seeing, is the fact that he is just calm, but again, this kid is coming from a big program. I attribute a lot of that to Ohio State. He has played in the big games and he is up here now going against NFL caliber players. I have told all the guys that you have to understand they put on their pads just like you just put on your pads, so just because you see an emblem on the side of their helmet that may say the Jets or may say the Bills, you have to understand that this is football. This is what you have done all your life, all of your career, so I truly believe that this kid is going to be one of the great ones for us down the road. Q: What have you seen from Leon Hall? A: Leon is a smart veteran. He is a guy that, it is funny, he is a guy that can actually, you can tell him once and he knows exactly what you are talking about. He understands concepts. The fact that he is a veteran player that has been playing in the NFL for the time that he has been in the league, eight, nine years, whatever it is. He is seeing a lot of the route concepts, so by him going back and seeing it from a deeper depth perception it has actually been refreshing for him. You ask him that and it is like, ‘Wow. This is pretty cool, I can see exactly what is going on in front of me’, and that is what you get as a safety. You are actually able to pull your eyes back and see it for what it is. That is what you are, you are the safety and you have to keep everyone else safe. You are the racer; you are the guy that has to make things right. What I think about Leon is the fact that he is very smart and he is able to understand the concepts and he is vocal as well. Q: How much does it help the back end of the defense that the D-line has been fortified? A: I will tell you. I have been fortunate to be able to be around here when we won two championships and it starts up front. Coach McAdoo preaches that it starts up front with the big guys. Whether you are on the offensive side or whether you are on the defensive side, but it is definitely going to help us tremendously. I mean, with the new guys we have in here; OV and Darian and Snacks. These guys are doing the things that I have been used to in the past, so we have that back.

Get News Alerts Sports © 2017 North Jersey Media Group August 25, 2016, 12:22 PM Last updated: Thursday, August 25, 2016, 12:25 PM Giants' Eli Apple ready for Jets on Saturday By ART STAPLETON STAFF WRITER |  The Record EAST RUTHERFORD – The football was in the air and Eli Apple had no problem going up to get it. AP FILE PHOTO Giants rookie cornerback Eli Apple (AP File Photo/Julio Cortez) The Giants’ first-round pick had textbook coverage on receiver Darius Powe – playing the scout-team part of Jets receiver Brandon Marshall – and showed no lingering limitation from the bruised knee that cost him a week of practice with a leaping interception. Afterward, Apple was not overly impressed. He expects to make plays like that often as the Giants continue to challenge him with plenty of first-team snaps in the secondary opposite Janoris Jenkins with veteran Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie shifting inside as slot cornerback. Well, that and Apple admitted the play shouldn’t have counted. “It wasn’t too great because we got an offside called on us, so technically it wasn’t a pick,” he said. “It felt good being out there with my team and being able to make those plays.” Defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo said he likes the way Apple has taken to his responsibilities within the Giants’ defense. “I think missing that game [in Buffalo last Saturday] kind of hurt, but I am keeping my fingers crossed that he stays healthy and gets into this game and gets a lot of reps and works with that first group,” Spagnuolo said. “I think that he is another young guy that has developed really well for us, and quicker than maybe we expected. I know always when you are drafted in the first round the expectations are way up here, and sometimes I think they are unfair, but when he stepped in for that first day it was pretty evident he could handle what comes with that. “We have to get into the game, and he has some good receivers that he has to go against, but I like the way he is developing right now.” Apple has taken his share of coverage assignments against Odell Beckham Jr., Sterling Shepard and Victor Cruz this summer, so he’s looking forward to the opportunity of matching up with Jets star receivers Marshall and Eric Decker as a good barometer for what’s to come. “They’re two of the best combo receivers out there in the league for sure,” Apple said. “Brandon Marshall is a big physical guy. Decker is a great route runner and is also pretty physical. They’re definitely going to help get us ready for the season. The third preseason game is very important for us to play well because most of the starters are going to be out there for the first half and a little bit of the third quarter. “We definitely want to pick it up, make those necessary adjustments from the last couple weeks and do our thing.” The Giants will meet the media this afternoon for the final time before Saturday night’s game with the Jets. Cruz is expected to speak about the chance to play his first game since Oct. 12, 2014, while Eli Manning and former Jets defensive tackle Damon “Snacks” Harrison could also talk with reporters. As for Apple, his maturation continues to progress. “I’m proud of myself on picking up the playbook. I don’t think I’m making too many mental mistakes,” Apple said. “I just want to play fast out there. That’s the main thing for me. We’ll see come Saturday how my development has been. That’s something I definitely want to show to everyone.” NorthJersey.com : Sports NorthJersey.com : Sports August 25, 2016, 12:22 PM Last updated: Thursday, August 25, 2016, 12:25 PM Giants' Eli Apple ready for Jets on Saturday Buy this photo AP FILE PHOTO Giants rookie cornerback Eli Apple (AP File Photo/Julio Cortez) By ART STAPLETON STAFF WRITER |  The Record EAST RUTHERFORD – The football was in the air and Eli Apple had no problem going up to get it.

X Business week: crunch time for Apple, the EU and US A big results week, IFA rows with ABP, employment is up and car insurance swerves Sat, Aug 27, 2016, 08:00 Albert Manifold, chief executive at CRH: he said continued positive momentum in the Americas and some recovery in Europe would continue to boost performance. Photograph: Cyril Byrne / The Irish Times         All the signs are that the EU Commission will shortly issue its final decision on the tax arrangements between Ireland and Apple. This week, the row started to heat up. Everyone expects the European Commission to stick to its original decision that the deal involved illegal state aid to the American giant. But the question is what the commission says should be done about it, and particularly how much tax the Irish Government should recoup. On Wednesday, the US treasury come out fighting, taking the unusual step of issuing a “ white paper”, which was a strong attack on what the commission was doing. While it was not specifically about Apple – the European Commission is also investigating the tax affairs of a number of other US giants – no-one was in any doubt that this case is the “ big one”. The treasury said that the EU commission was acting beyond its powers as a “supra-national” tax authority. It went on to argue that, as US companies had no notice of this new approach, it was particularly unreasonable for the commission to tell countries to seek to recoup tax payments going back years. The commission’s approach, it added, threatened the whole multilateral approach to tax. Add in a warning about the potential “chilling” impact on transatlantic investment and a not very veiled threat to unspecified retaliation and you can see what is at stake here. The commission is expected to press ahead and make its decision. But how much will it say Ireland should collect from Apple? Either way, it looks very likely that this affair – already three years cooking – will now head to the European courts, meaning we will not get a final outcome for a few more years. COMPANY RESULTS In a big week for company results, CRH was in focus, promising a return to dividend growth for the first time in seven years and signalling that full-year earnings will top €3 billion. The company lifted its interim dividend by 1.6 per cent to 18.6 cents, after reporting figures slightly ahead of market expectations. Chief executive Albert Manifold said continued positive momentum in the Americas and some recovery in Europe would continue to boost performance. ADVERTISEMENT CRH spent a massive €6.5 billion buying assets hived off after the merger of Lafarge and Holcim, but such is its earnings growth that the market remains confident that the extra debt taken on to fund this will quickly reduce. And now, in the relentless drive to growth, Manifold is signalling more acquisitions on the radar, with the possibility of spending €1.5 billion to €2 billion in the year ahead.

The gambling giant created last February, when Paddy Power and Betfair joined forces, said that revenues grew 18 per cent to £759 million in the six months ended June 30th from £642 million during the same period last year. Operating profits grew 39 per cent to £147.6 million from £106.5 million over the same period. However, a £195.1 million charge for February’s merger left it with a £47.5 million loss. The group said that it expected full-year earnings to be £365-£385 million. Kingspan had strong results, reporting that pre-tax profit rose 54 per cent to €155 million in what was a record first half for the insulation and building materials maker. Revenues rose 19 per cent to €1.47 billion in the six months ended June 30th from €1.24 billion during the same period last year. Trading profit also rose by about 50 per cent, growing to €167.3 million from €111.7 million, well ahead of the €140 million and €150 million predicted by most analysts. Chief executive Gene Murtagh said the Cavan group expected the momentum to continue into the second half. IFA ROW OVER LEVIES The Irish Farmers’ Association (IFA) faces substantial losses following a row over the collection of levies from farmers. Larry Goodman’s ABP has thrown the cat among the pigeons by ceasing automatic collection levies on farm sales, a vital source of funding for the IFA. The company claims it was acting on foot of persistent complaints from farmers about the way the tariff was administered. The IFA, however, claims the move was designed to sabotage its funding arrangements and weaken its standing in the farming sector. In response, it cancelled ABP’s authorisation to collect it, effectively jettisoning up to €300,000 in contributions from ABP suppliers. Now all eyes on whether other processors will follow Goodman’s lead, a move that could have disastrous consequences for the farmers’ group, which is still reeling from a string of pay scandals involving former bosses. MOTOR INSURANCE CRISIS The Irish motor insurance market is in crisis, with premiums rising by almost 40 per cent a year. And there is little sign of relief for drivers. This week’s news that Gibraltar-based underwriter Zenith Insurance is to withdraw from the market will not lead to the same immediate crisis for policyholders as the Setanta collapse. Existing policies will remain in force and claims will be met. It further reduces competition in the market meaning premiums will probably continue to rise. Of course the problem appears to have been that previous competition for market share drove premiums down to unsustainable levels. Add in the high cost of claims here and you have a toxic mix which is hitting policyholders hard in the pocket. EMPLOYMENT RISES Amid all the dire warnings about Brexit, there was further good news for the economy this week with the Central Statistics Office’s Quarterly National Household Survey showing the number of people working in the State has reached two million for the first time since 2009. The survey revealed unemployment had also fallen by 23,400, or 11 per cent, in the year to the end of June, pushing the total number out of work down to 187,800, marking the 16th consecutive quarter in which unemployment has fallen. ADVERTISEMENT While unemployment rates are up, with the July figure at 8.3 per cent as against the previous 7.8 per cent, the change was due to an increase in the labour force, rather than newly unemployed people.       Topics: Albert Manifold Gene Murtagh Larry Goodman Paddy Power Eu Irish Farmers Organisation Irish Government Abp Apple CRH Goodman Group Holcim Kingspan Lafarge Europe Ireland United States Read More Dollar recovers from two-week lows in thin market trading More than 2,000 jobs saved by examinership in 2016 New year: Five ways tech can spring clean your life Should have bought bitcoin?

The plan would be to store an unauthorized user's biometric information to boost security. Potentially, this data could then be transmitted anywhere or used in later legal proceedings. For example, server-side systems could potentially cross-reference fingerprint data and photos with an online database of known users. Revealed in Apple Insider, Apple's invention covers "Biometric capture for unauthorized user identification". Using different constraints, varying levels of capture could be set. For instance, a single or multiple failed authentication triggers could be used to capture fingerprint data and a picture of the user. Other data can augment the biometric information, for example time stamps, device location, speed, air pressure, audio data and more, all collected and logged as background operations.

Well, Apple is seemingly looking into new ways to curb any potential threat, and could use the power of your iPhone to help catch thieves in the act.  Judging by a recent patent application, the company claims a method of "capturing biometric information for identifying unauthorised users", including fingerprints, video or audio, could be used to help protect the precious insides of your phone.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below The information could then be stored or sent to a server, where police could presumably use it to figure out who the culprit is. ©  Apple The Touch ID sensor, front camera and microphone are already in place, meaning the process could work in a similar way to current third-party apps.  While in theory and patent form the tech seems all well and good, whether it could actually be implemented without legal concerns is up in the air. It should be used to help capture a potential thief, but do you really want to risk sending your 5-year-old brother's fingerprint data off to police when he decides to play around on your new iPhone?

Share Tweet Share Tags : iOS-iOS+ Apple-Apple+ Patents-Patents+ Future Apple devices with fingerprint scanners and cameras may employ a new method for dealing with potential abductors, and when we say abductors, we actually mean unscrupulous gadget thieves. It's a terrible feeling, this – realizing that your cool high-tech toy has been stolen. An endless stream of questions enters begins tormenting your racing mind: who did it? What can they do with it? Should I change all my passwords? Is there any hope of ever finding the device? The struggle is real. Okay, that might have been a bit of an exaggeration on our part, but it's totally an uncool position to be in. Trust us. Anyway, there are various things you can do if your smartphone is stolen (or lost, for that matter), and we'd advice to take a good look at all of them, in case you find yourself in such an unenviable position. Links down below. Apple is now looking at adding another possible course of action to the mix, by securing a patent that could result in future iDevices storing biometric information and other data of unauthorized users. In other words, next iterations of the iPhone and iPad may store fingerprint data and attempt to snap a picture of the user with the front-facing camera, in case their biometric credentials are not recognized. Apple was granted the patent, initially filed in late April, by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) earlier on Thursday. The abstract of the patent goes over some of the data that may be collected by the security system, should it be implemented in the first place, which includes “one or more fingerprints, one or more images of a current user of the computing device, video of the current user, audio of the environment of the computing device, forensic interface use information” and so on. Said data will likely be initially stored locally on the device itself, and sent to remote servers for further evaluation, when the device is connected to the Internet. The patent documentation states that once delivered to the servers, the biometric data may then pass various procedures for cross-referencing it with an already existing database of information for existing users. With all that said, don't hold your breath that this year's iPhone will implement this technology, or next year's for that matter. Or maybe even next next year's. One such proactive security system would fall into a legal gray area, as far as current anti-theft measures go, and would call for a considerable amount of deliberation before its implementation is allowed. Furthermore, even if it is eventually allowed, it might have to undergo drastic changes in order to fit within the established regulatory measures.

Still wont stop someone from going into dfu mode though. But gives me enough time to catch the dude with the police.

First thing I'd do after stealing iPhone is entering DFU mode, it gets untraceable so easily. Turn on airplane mode from lockscreen? No problem, turn on airplane mode when CC is disabled? No problem, use Siri Seriously, I know the thief wouldn't be able to use it but you still won't have your phone and even a way to find it Jailbreak solves all of these problems but on 9.3 it's tethered so just reboot and all ani theft tweaks are gone posted on 25 Aug 2016, 10:52 1 Reply 6.

Apple undoubtedly has one of the most top-grade security systems for its iPhones; even experts working for the government have failed to crack the device. However, it seems like the company is not satisfied and wants to beef up encryption a bit more. A recently published patent application by the US Patent and Trademark Office explains a system to capture video, audio and even fingerprints of anyone trying to hack into any iDevice. Dubbed “Biometric Capture for Unauthorized User Identification,” the background of this patent suggests how a user’s computing devices such as laptops, smartphones, tablets and music players contain a lot of personal information. Apple is well-aware of the problems a user has to go through if this type of data falls into the wrong hands and that’s why it wants to beef up security on its devices even further. Several ways to protect these computing devices already exist, such as passcodes and fingerprint scanners. Apple also has “Find My iPhone” app, which helps users erase all the data before a thief gains access to their device. However, it seems that the company is still not satisfied and wants to come up with a hack-proof system. Therefore, Apple is working on a system which will not just protect data on a device but also help track the thieves/hackers. If the tech giant does come up with such a system, it’ll most likely discourage thieves from stealing an Apple device. The method explained within the document for integrating this feature seems to be easy as the components required for this are already present in iPhones and iPads. Moreover, as mentioned before, this feature can either use biometric data, video, audio or all of them to identify unauthorized users. However, the device will obtain this data on a given number of wrong attempts, as some leeway for mistakes are provided to the owner of the device. Once the number of tries to login on a particular device exceeds the allowed limit, the feature will immediately activate, record and send the data to the concerned authorities. It should be noted that several similar applications already exist in the market, however, they are only available on Cydia — the app directory for jail broken iOS devices. Moreover, these apps only take pictures using the front camera and email it to the user but they don’t extract biometric data, video or audio. Similar apps also exist on Android devices and are not even required to be rooted. Apple may have been late again at getting a feature on its device, but we believe it seems to be more productive than the ones that already exist. The iPhone maker might not have to do much in extraction of data required for this technology, as this technology seems to be more dependent on software than hardware. However, the quality of the front camera and microphone might have to be improved in order to obtain accurate results. Lastly, the tech giant hasn’t confirmed which devices will have this feature. We might just see it on Apple devices releasing in 2017. However, since it’s just a patent, there is a possibility that we might never even see this feature on any Apple devices.

(Photo : Photo by Stephen Lam/ Getty Images) On Thursday, August 25, Apple published a new patent application that suggests the high-tech company will incorporate anti-theft technology in its future iPhones.  Future iPhones Will Collect Thief's Biometric Data According to Apple's new patent application, the company is interested to implement in its future iPhones an anti-theft measure that will capture covertly both a fingerprint and a photo of a phone thief. Some version of the technology presented in the patent application might go into future iPads and iPhones. The Verge reports that Apple's patent application imagines a system that will capture biometric data of the person holding the iPhone when a "trigger condition" is present. Among the trigger conditions could be the detection of an unauthorized user attempting to bypass the iPhone's security features or an unauthorized access coming from a third-party device. This biometric information may include one or more images of the current iPhone user, one or more fingerprints, audio of the environment, video of the current user, forensic interface use information and more, according to details provided by the patent abstract. According to Apple Insider, the unauthorized user's data could be sent to a remote server for further analysis or stored locally on the device. The stored biometric information may used then for identification of the unauthorized user. Legal Issues Involved In Capturing Biometric Data There are some technical and legal issues challenging Apple's idea. Capturing a phone thief's biometric data like fingerprints and photos raises some privacy and legal red flags. Even if it is a feature designed for consumers protection, covertly capturing and storing biometric information could tarnish Apple's reputation with regards to user privacy. Apple used to brag about its decision to not store any unencrypted information. Apple CEO Tim Cook has routinely used the company's record on privacy to present in a favorable light Apple hardware and software. The company did not take any steps back on the user privacy issues even when confronted with FBI investigations. Such an anti-theft system might be unprecedented. From a technical perspective, Apple's TouchID fingerprint-reading technology implemented in iPhones today requires that users hold down their finger in a variety of angles and numerous times to accurately capture the print. If the company plans to introduce such an anti-theft system future versions of Apple's fingerprint scanners and Touch ID will need to be able to collect fingerprints in a more efficient manner.

Called “Biometric capture for unauthorized user identification,” the patent describes how an unrecognized user’s biometric information (fingerprint) could be stored locally, or on the cloud, to be utilized at a later time for identification. A couple of years ago, it was recognized that iPhones were the most targeted by UK thieves. At the moment, there’s no official plan to actually implement the system, but Apple has deemed the idea important enough to file a patent. If implemented one day, it would be a drastic change in how biometric information is handled. With current policies, most devices avoid transmitting biometric information and keep them encrypted in a secure area of the hardware. The fear is that transmission could be prone to interception and decryption, given enough time and computing power. Without transmission, physical access to the phone would be required, which limits the possibility of mass leaks of millions of records at once. Learn more: How do Fingerprint Scanners Work? If transmitted, the biometric data (either fingerprint or fingerprint digital signature) could be cross-referenced with a database of known users or government databases. At the same time, it’s very easy to record and send other information pertinent to theft, such as the GPS location (or recent route), the keystrokes and swipes or even photos taken with the front camera. Of course, it would be a huge problem for thieves who would then need to take extra precautions, although this would target the careless thief rather than the organized one. Thieves have proven very resourceful and some don’t hesitate to dig tunnels to steal iPhones. Also, it’s easy to imagine how children could trigger false alerts etc… Transmitting information about thieves is not new, and there are plenty of examples of stolen iPhones sending data to the cloud, like this thief who streamed his photos from a stolen iPhone, or that one who was unknowingly documenting his life on Tumblr. This is an idea that is worth discussing because phone theft is rampant, and OEMs are often accused of not doing enough to deter illegal sales of stolen property. For instance, it’s a fact that the Activation Lock deters theft. What do you think? Yay or Nay? Filed in Apple. Read more about iPad, iPhone, stolen, theft.

MenuHome News Home News News Apple Thief Prevention Answer Is At The Tip Your Fingers By Staff Reporter | August 26, 2016 Share Tweet Share Share 0 comments If you have misplaced your Apple iPhone or lost it, Apple will allow you to remotely locate or wipe out the details on your device but that is not enough now as Apple will be working to also identify the thief at the same time. Since all the new Apple iPhone will not come with a fingerprint sensor, Apple is thinking about using the Touch ID sensor on the Apple iPhone to record the fingerprints when the device is reported to be lost. That means if somebody stole the iPhone tried opening it up with the home button, the device will record their fingerprint and send it to the authority. In the new patent files, it also suggests that Apple might take it a little further and actually record and the voice or snap a picture of the thief. We don’t know if Apple will get around release this new safety system but it is clear that Apple is still working on making their smartphone more secure.

By Edelweiss Snow, Parent Herald August 26, 01:00 pm TAG Apple Watch, Apple Watch 2, apple, iPhone 7, samsung gear s3 Ever since rumors about the Apple Watch 2 release date surfaced online, tech junkies around the globe have flocked the internet for more information on Apple's newest wearable device. Not a lot has been disclosed about the new gadget, but several tech insiders have already dished on the new smartwatch this early. Despite no word from the Cupertino-based tech giant, several Apple Watch 2 release date rumors seem to hint that the new watch will boast of some noteworthy features. Some previous reports have even claimed that this could be Apple's beacon of light since most loyal Apple consumers are not sure whether the iPhone 7 will be a good buy. Several tech sites and blogs have suggested that the new Apple Watch 2 will be an independent device compared to its predecessor. According to Vine Report, Apple is expected to showcase more upgrades and improvements on the new smartwatch, but users should not expect a different look and feel to it. Some of the rumored upgrades for the new Apple Watch reportedly involves features that will make it a stand-alone gadget. Should Apple pursue this path, fans should expect a SIM card slot on their wearable devices as this will be crucial in making the Apple Watch 2 independent from the iPhone. Meanwhile, the Apple Watch 2 might have some serious competition when the Samsung Gear S3 gets released. According to Mobile & Apps, the android wearable device that could be available next month also boasts of notable improvements including a doubled battery capacity.

Yesterday, Apple released a critical update for the iOS after some terrifying zero-day vulnerabilities were discovered; we would advise you to update your iPhone right away. Apparently, the highly advanced malware that lead to last night’s urgent update was created in Israel. Earlier this month at the Black Hat digital security-focused conference, the head of Apple’s security engineering, Ivan Krstic, told a spellbound audience that the secretive company was opening up its highly secure, premium branded operating systems to researchers for vulnerability report processing. In essence, Mr. Krstic announced the launch of the tech giant’s bug bounty program offering various rewards including $50,000 for discovering zero-day vulnerabilities, which let malicious exploits access to the OS’ kernel. The idea behind such bounty programs is to discover zero-day vulnerabilities – security flaws that are explored by hackers but are unknown to the company itself – in order to make the system more secured. A look from the outside by third-party researchers can offer valuable information in search of such security flaws and Apple wanted to compensate them for the effort. A week after the announcement, the iPhone-maker’s concern for such vulnerabilities turned out to be justified. An activist in the United Arab Emirates, Ahmed Mansoor, received some odd text messages on his iPhone that he later presented in front of Citizen Lab – the advanced research lab based in the Munk School of Global Affairs at the University of Toronto in Canada. Citizen Lab and Lookout, a security firm, analyzed the suspicious link in Mr. Mansoor’s text messages and discovered that clicking it could deliver a sophisticated collection of three zero-days, which could take total control of the device and spy on text messages, emails, contacts, and calls. Given the spyware’s three-headed nature that targeted Mr. Mansoor’s iPhone, the Lookout team named it “Trident.” The iOS exploit starts as an ordinary phishing attack where the attacker sends a link to the target as a click-bait. In this case, the link in the text message was apparently about how detainees are tortured in the country. The first zero-day was discovered in Safari – the default iPhone web browser – where corrupt memory vulnerability allowed hackers to execute the arbitrary code. The rest two zero-days are then downloaded to the mobile device as kernel exploits. And this can happen rather subtly; had Mr. Mansoor clicked the link, he would’ve seen Safari unexpectedly shutting down as the only indication of initiating Trident and having his device compromised. The first kernel exploit – the second zero-day – works on an information leak granting the hacker the location of the kernel in the iPhone’s memory. The kernel is a crucial component to the device’s secured booting process and Apple really prides itself on obfuscating its location in the memory. Unfortunately, this complex attack is capable of locating it. Once the kernel is located, the third zero-day comes into play, which allows the attacker to read/write data. At this stage, the iPhone is jail-broken and surveillance software can be externally deployed to collect information from the device’s applications; both third-party and Apple’s. This is indeed scary and Lookout’s security research team has also stressed on the highly sophisticated nature of this zero-day attack. On August 15, Apple was informed of the Trident vulnerabilities and within 10 days, the tech giant came out with patches for all three zero-days. An Apple spokesperson said: “We were made aware of this vulnerability and immediately fixed it with iOS 9.3.5. We advise all of our customers to always download the latest version of iOS to protect themselves against potential security exploits.” While the malware has been discovered and dealt with, one would wonder where such a highly sophisticated three zero-day combination could come from. According to Citizen Lab, the vulnerabilities came from NSO Group – a surveillance software developer based in Israel. NSO seems to have branded the zero-days as a product named Pegasus and is possibly offering such exploits for other operating systems too, such as Android. Lookout estimates that the Trident has existed as a product for nearly two years. The six year old NSO Group maintains minor presence on the Internet and keeps a low profile on purpose. According to Lookout, it focuses exclusively on exploits in the mobile space. In 2014, the founders – Omri Lavie, Shalev Hulio, and Niv Carmi – sold it for $110 million to Francisco Partners but they still seem to be running the show. The company sells its products to authorized government clients such as Mexico, Panama and also the UAE apparently. In the response statement, NSO Group distanced itself from the attack on Mr. Mansoor and denied selling its wares for illegal purposes. It wrote: “The agreements signed with the company’s customers require that the company’s products be used in a lawful manner. Specifically, the products may only be used for the prevention and investigation of crimes. The company has no knowledge of and cannot confirm the specific cases mentioned in your inquiry.” It seems like NSO Group’s products are committed to stealth and its wares have never really been caught before. Lookout estimates that the zero-day vulnerabilities could have been used to attack between 10,000 and 100,000 devices. Now, the NSO Group is being exposed and three of its creepy zero-days have been resolved. Citizen Lab and Lookout have been intrigued and want to find out more about the NSO Group. Citizen Lab has already published information on the command and control and domain structures that NSO Group’s products use. Lookout continues its research into the latest malware discovered and hints at publishing further details soon. For now, it is devising a method for iOS users to find out if their devices have been compromised. If you want to check your device, download the Lookout app to scan your device for any piece of coding with the NSO Group brand. While these three zero-days have been patched, there might be many more still out there. Thus, the iPhone maker continues its push to squeeze out vulnerabilities on its “all-secure” devices before others do.

Apple iPhone 7 is just weeks away and based on rumors, enthusiasts along with analysts are not excited about the device. Similar reports suggested that next year’s variant will make up for this year’s model, sporting radical changes. It looks like the latter claims might just prove to be true, as multiple sources have hinted some revolutionary additions for the 2017 iPhone. A recent report suggests that it will ditch the “iconic home button.” The single button with a complete touch screen was one factor, which made iPhone stand out. With every iteration, Apple improved its functionality and made this one button capable of doing myriad of tasks. The functionality and importance of home button increased with the launch of iPhone 5s in 2013, as it supported TouchID - the fingerprint scanner. However, no matter how significant this button has been in building up the whole iPhone experience for its users; some have still hated it for acting up at times. It seems the iPhone maker has finally decided to cut the chords and put an end to problems faced by users. According to BGR, people privy to the matter have revealed that Apple plans to eliminate the home button and stretch the screen to the bottom, where this button used to be in the prior iterations of iPhones. The publication further explains that the physical button might be removed, but its functionalities will be available in the display. The screen is expected to have sensors, which will act as an invisible button. Clearly it might sound unrealistic at the moment, but similar technology is already featured in MacBooks touchpads. Despite parting ways with the button, the TouchID remains intact. It will also be implemented in the display. However, what is unknown till now is whether there will be a specific point on the screen or the whole will serve as a fingerprint scanner. All this looks dreamy and can even have drawbacks, but analysts believe Apple has its way and is ready to stun users. Subsequently, only few days ago a report was announced that speculated three new models of iPhone in 2017; one with an OLED with curved edges similar to Samsung’s Galaxy S7 Edge, whereas the other two will be usual with bezels on both sides. However, it does not shed light whether all three will ditch the button, or will just be bezel-less with curved screens. Stay tuned till we get more updates for you!

(NASDAQ:AAPL) music streaming service is turning into a pretty big win for the company and Apple services is turning into a giant. STORY: START WITH MUSIC Apple Inc. introduced its music streaming service a year ago and it was simple. Pay $10, get your music on. It entered an industry with some larger players, like Pandora and most famously Spotify, which at the time had 24 million subscribers. As of today, an estimate from MIDiA Research estimates puts Apple Music at a staggering 16 million paying subscribers, already. While there's a story to be told around Apple's strategy to get in nice and close with some music's greatest stars, the real story surrounds the success that the company has driven in just a year, the success it may now bring with new deals, and further, the success it is driving in its broader Apple Services segment. SUCCESS: SERVICES Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) found success by using its greatest asset of them all -- its existing iPhone install base. Whether new iPhone sales slow, or even shrink, the install base of the iPhone is growing. That collection of people gives Apple an incredible advantage in selling services like Apple Pay, Apple Music, and others. Here's a chart from a Bloomberg article which plots the impressive growth in Apple Music -- but also gives us time for pause. Source: Bloomberg This isn't an Apple Music story, it's an Apple Services story. Tim Cook so eloquently put it on the last earnings call when he said that Apple Services in and of itself will be large enough to be a Fortune 100 company by next year. That's impressive considering Apple Services only makes up about 14% of total Apple Inc. revenue. For some context, here is a chart of services revenue and a little tidbit about Facebook. We can see that Apple Inc. services is larger than all of Facebook's revenue. Now, that will change by next year, as Facebook is still seeing 50% growth rates while Apple Services will grow at a slower pace, but the point is, 14% of Apple's business is the size of Facebook. It's happening – Apple is diversifying. Here's a better image of the trend: Services never made up more than 12% of Apple's revenue, now it stands at 14%. Certainly the shrinking iPhone sales have made the comparison a little easier for services, but in general, the trend is higher, and it's only the beginning. Apple Pay is a booming business. At its core, Apple Pay is a mobile payment application – swipe your phone and Pay. That little piece is in and of itself rather genius in that it ends the need for credit cards and passwords while adding convenience and security. The trend is astonishing, in general for mobile Pay: Even better, Apple announced that it would bring Apple Pay first to mobile e-commerce sites, and then to the broader web. For any Apple product owner, whether it be an iPhone, iPad, iMac, MacBook or other computing device, a purchase online, mobile or otherwise, has become as simple as touching the screen. Apple has turned our fingerprints into our credit cards, PayPal accounts, debit cards and cash. It is, effectively, the "password killer." We could go on and on with Apple pays explosive adoption in China and on to other Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) services, but the point is more easily drawn out in one sentence: Apple is turning its install base into a gigantic services company that will grow independently of iPhone sales. That is the bullish thesis for Apple. The rapid success of Apple Music is yet another empirical data point. Next up for Apple is augmented reality (patent filed), Social media (patent filed) and medical technology services (patent filed).

But its release last weekend, through an exclusive deal with Apple, has also roiled the industry, bringing to the surface longsimmering tensions that record companies have with streaming music services, and sometimes even with their own artists. Within days of the album's release, revelations about Ocean and Blonde emerged that portray a business deeply in flux. Ocean, it seemed, was no longer signed to record company Def Jam, when Blonde was released. He had apparently fulfilled his contractual agreement with the label with the release of a separate "visual album" the day before Blonde came out - a move that cut Def Jam and its corporate parent, Universal Music Group, out of the profits for one of the year's mostanticipated albums. At the same time, Universal's management decided to clamp down on the growing practice of releasing new music through exclusive deals with digital outlets such as Apple Music and Tidal. The move reasserts the label's control over the music its artists produce, but risks alienating top performers who benefit from such promotions. The story about Ocean's exit from Def Jam began to take shape when fans noticed that the label's name was nowhere to be found in the credits for Blonde. That album had come out just a day after the release of Ocean's Endless, the 46-minute "visual album", also an Apple Music exclusive. Despite its idiosyncratic format, Endless - one long streaming film, whose songs are not available separately - fulfilled Ocean's contractual obligations to Def Jam, enabling him to release Blonde through Apple without any involvement from the label, say sources. The way Blonde was released is viewed as representative of a wider shift in the power dynamics among artists, record labels and technology companies. Over the last year, major albums by stars such as Beyonce and Drake were released first through exclusive streaming deals of various kinds. Deals such as these are seen as examples of digital services interfering in labels' relationships with artists. But the tide may be turning against exclusives, at least from the perspective of the labels. After the release of Ocean's album, Universal Music Group chairman Lucian Grainge sent a private memo to top executives at the company's labels, calling for an end to long-term exclusive deals with a single service, said a source. Yet, that edict may still leave the company with plenty of room to negotiate more limited deals with digital services.

Home > News > Frank Ocean's "Blonde" Illegally Downloaded Over 750,000 Times Frank Ocean's "Blonde" Illegally Downloaded Over 750,000 Times 3131 99 31K Posted by Angus Walker, Aug 26, 2016 at 07:18pm Despite its Apple exclusivity, Frank Ocean's "Blonde" has been an easy find for Internet pirates. The first-week predictions for Frank Ocean's Blonde were just revealed, and he's set to take the No. 1 spot by a long shot, as the album is expected to move 225-250k in equivalent album units. That's not to mention the entirely separate "visual album," entitled Endless, that he put out the day before. While an audio version of Endless is not yet available, Blonde was exclusively released on iTunes as an album-only purchase (no individual tracks) and for streaming via Apple Music. Much of the album's first-week sales figures will have been generated through its streaming numbers, which have become an increasingly dominant factor in tracking album sales, especially with streaming exclusives like VIEWS and The Life of Pablo.  While streaming is up and traditional album purchases are down, it seems that a lot of fans are still readily downloading high-profile releases illegally. Not just those with Apple Music have been able to acquire Blonde. In fact, Music Business Worldwide reports that as of 7AM EST on Thurs. (Aug. 25), Blonde had been illegally downloaded 753,849 times.  Music Business Worldwide generated the above numbers via the anti-piracy company MUSO, which only tracked downloads of Blonde in its entirety and not of individual tracks, reports Complex.  Two days after Kanye West dropped his February album The Life of Pablo, released as a Tidal exclusive, it was reported that the album had already been illegally downloaded over 500,000 times. It's looking like streaming exclusives are being countered with rampant piracy. In any case, it appears there is still a huge component of the listening audience opposed to the dominance that a few streaming platforms have exercised over the releases of mainstream music, and at this point, they've found ways to get their hands on the most in-demand projects for free.  Tags: News, Frank Ocean, blonde, Industry, apple, apple music, streaming, piracy, illegal download Frank Ocean's "Blonde" Illegally Downloaded Over 750,000 Times By Angus Walker Angus Walker @gowangus Follow Posted Aug 26, 2016 at 07:18pm 30,999 Views 99 Comments 3131 Frank Ocean's "Blonde" Illegally Downloaded Over 750,000 Times Share Slideshow NEXT ARTICLE Staff Picks Playlist (August 26) HNHH's weekly round-up of our favorite tracks of the week.

The vulnerabilities, collectively dubbed Trident, were combined into a malware named Pegasus by the NSO Group, an organization that reportedly specializes in “cyber war,” according to an August 25 Lookout blog post. Pegasus is highly advanced in its use of zero-days, obfuscation, encryption and kernel-level exploitation and the malware has been active for some time, the post said.  Researchers believe the spyware has already been used in the wild for state-sponsored activities, including against a Mexican journalist who reported on corruption by Mexico's head of state, and an unknown number of targets in Kenya. The malware is spread, the post said, through a basic phishing attack sequence which includes a text message, open web browser, load page, exploit vulnerabilities, install persistent software to gather information The issue was disclosed to Apple 10 days before the update was rolled out and judging by the speed by which Apple responded, the vulnerabilities were treated as critical within Apple, Guillaume Ross, a senior security consultant at Rapid 7, told SCMagazine.com via emailed comments. “This attack basically exploits an issue in Safari, exploits the kernel to effectively jailbreak the phone, and then persists on to the device,” Ross wrote. “Jailbreak software is regularly released publicly, and exploits such vulnerabilities, but with a major difference: this software exploits the iOS device locally, over USB or such an interface, and not simply by clicking a link, though that has also occurred in the past.” Ross said detecting attacks such as this is extremely difficult after the fact. "We were made aware of this vulnerability and immediately fixed it with iOS 9.3.5.,” an Apple representative told SCMagazine.com on Thursday via emailed comments. “We advise all of our customers to always download the latest version of iOS to protect themselves against potential security exploits" Zero-days attacks like Trident are extremely valuable in a world where IT is used as a weapon, and the vulnerabilities are especially valuable to nation-states looking to obtain data, Cesare Garlati, chief security strategist at the prpl Foundation, told SCMagazine.com on Thursday via emailed comments. “The one thing that surprises me is the ease with which we attribute vulnerabilities to mistakes/errors in coding,” Garlati said. “I'm more and more convinced that some of these vulnerabilities are introduced on purpose, without the knowledge of the vendor, to serve nation-states.”  California Congressman Ted Lieu (D-Ca.) said in an Aug 25. press release that he is alarmed but not surprised by the discovery of the vulnerability. “I am pleased that Apple was able to quickly address this security breach, but it is clear that Congress must do more to address the issues of mobile security,” Lieu said. “I believe a congressional hearing is in order and plan to work with my colleagues to examine these critical security concerns.” Topics: Cyberattack Vulnerabilities Vulnerabilities You must be a registered member of SC Magazine US to post a comment.

 5 years of Tim Cook's Apple, in charts Jan Dawson, Medium Aug. 25, 2016, 12:43 PM 1,460 facebook linkedin twitter email print Getty This week marks the fifth anniversary of Tim Cook’s appointment as permanent CEO at Apple  —  he was appointed CEO on August 24th, 2011. As a result, we’ll no doubt see quite a few retrospectives this week looking back over his time at Apple, and evaluating his tenure. As context for that analysis, I wanted to share some numbers about Apple in the quarter and year before he took over, and compare it with numbers for the quarter and year ending in June of this year. Not all the applicable data sets go back that far  —  Apple has changed its reporting segments in at least a couple of ways during this five year period, but we’ll mostly try to compare before and after as closely as possible. Note: here as in all the analysis on this blog, I use calendar quarters rather than companies’ fiscal quarters for analysis for ease of comprehension by those not familiar with companies’ fiscal calendars — hence, Q2 2016 is the June quarter recently ended and reported. Many of the charts shown here are part of the Apple quarterly deck which is available as part of the Jackdaw Research Quarterly Decks Service , which you can read more about here. The underlying data is also available on a custom basis as either a one-off delivery or a quarterly service — please contact me for more information. P&L measures Let’s start with the corporate income statement. By any measure, Apple is simply a lot larger than it was five years ago. Here are trailing 4-quarter revenues: Apple Reporting, Jackdaw Research Revenues in the four quarters before Tim Cook was appointed were $100 billion, whereas in the last four quarters they were over $200 billion. However, as you can see from the chart, it hasn’t been an inexorable rise up and to the right. Revenues grew very strongly in that first period, then began to level off somewhat throughout 2012 and 2013, then spiked following the iPhone 6 launch. And of course over the past year revenue growth has been negative for the first time in many years at Apple. The overall effect is still a more than doubling of total revenue, but the current trajectory is negative. As I’ve written previously, I continue to believe that we’ll see a reversal of this trend in the next few quarters as a combination of factors kicks in, but I’m betting Tim Cook would have rather his 5 year anniversary would have fallen either side of this lull instead of in the middle of it. Meanwhile, margins have been up and down over time, with a bump in the early part of Tim Cook’s time at the helm, followed by a drop down to slightly lower levels, a steady rise, and then a drop off again: Apple reporting, Jackdaw research The ups and downs here largely correlate to overall growth rates for Apple, with higher revenue growth rates driving higher margins for a time as cost expansion takes a while to catch up with revenue growth, only to fall again as growth slows. On operating and net margin, Apple has ended these five years slightly below where it started, whereas on gross margin it’s in more or less the same place. But it’s worth noting that dollar profits are still way up on where they were, and that’s the metric that Apple and its investors are likely more focused on: Apple Reporting, Jackdaw Research Yes, there’s the same up-and-down pattern, but again operating income on a twelve-month basis is roughly twice what it was five years ago over the past year. R&D spend has ballooned The only other line from the income statement I want to zero in on is research and development spending, because there’s been a fairly dramatic change here over the past five years. Here’s total R&D spend in dollars on a twelve-month basis, and spending as a percentage of revenue: Apple Reporting, Jackdaw Research Apple Reporting, Jackdaw Research R&D spend was under $2.5 billion the four quarters before Tim Cook took over, but it was almost $10 billion five years later, a roughly fourfold increase. And that’s not just because Apple’s revenue has grown during that time — R&D has actually grown significantly as a percentage of revenue over the same period, going from just over 2% to just over 4%, or almost doubling as a percentage. That’s interesting, because R&D actually fell fairly consistently as a percentage of revenue during most of Steve Jobs’ second stint as Apple CEO, from a peak of 8% in 2001 and 2002 all the way down to 2% just before Cook took over. That’s largely a function of the massive iPod- and iPhone-driven revenue growth during that period — dollar R&D spend rose from around $400 million a year to over $2 billion a year during the same time period — but it’s interesting to note that Cook has reversed the trend and significantly increased R&D spend even above and beyond the rate at which revenue has grown. Interestingly, that 2 percentage point increase in R&D spend is roughly equal to the 2 percentage point drop in margins during the Tim Cook era. The cash hoard grows The other major corporate financial metric that’s worth a quick look is cash. Apple’s cash and investment assets have grown enormously over the past five years, as the two charts below show: Apple reporting, Jackdaw Research Apple reporting, Jackdaw Research The starting and ending totals are easier to see in the second chart, but the steady growth is perhaps easier to see in the first. Regardless, Apple ended calendar Q2 2011 with a total balance of cash and investments of $76 billion, while it ended Q2 2016 with a balance of $231.5 billion. In other words, it has added over $155 billion to its coffers over this time. Meanwhile, an increasing proportion of this cash and investments has been held overseas — the percentage was 63% five years ago, but was 93% at the end of Q2 2016. Of course, the other cash-related metric worth noting during the first five years of the Cook era is the way Apple has been using that cash to pay dividends and buy back stock. Steve Jobs famously refused to pay dividends, but around a year into his tenure, Tim Cook instituted both these programs to return cash to shareholders. As of April of this year, Apple said it had “returned over $163 billion to shareholders, including $117 billion in share repurchases.” That makes the increase in its overall pile of cash and investments all the more remarkable. Unit shipments are up for iPhone, less so for other products One of the most interesting things to look at in regard to the last five years is what’s happened to unit shipments for Apple’s three major product lines. The long-term trend is shown in this first chart: Apple Reporting, Jacksaw Research Again, we’re all familiar with the trajectory of iPhone sales over recent years, so let’s be brief here. It’s worth noting that Tim Cook’s appointment coincided with the decision to move the launch date for new iPhones from June to the Fall, with the iPhone 4s launching in October of 2011. That explains the flat part at the beginning of the iPhone chart above. Following that shift, though, the iPhone saw strong growth in 2012 and 2013, but began to flatten out, only to spike in late 2014 and into 2015 thanks to the iPhone 6, then slumping a little in late 2015 and the first half of 2016. But again, it’s worth looking at the total numbers here. Apple shipped 69 million iPhones in the four quarters to Q2 2011, and shipped 214 million in the most recent four quarters. That’s a massive expansion of Apple’s business here, despite the recent lull (shipments peaked at 231.5 million on a twelve month basis in Q4 2015). It’s also interesting to note that Apple has shipped 859 million iPhones during the Tim Cook era, compared with just 130 million in the pre-Cook era. In other words, roughly 87% of the almost one billion iPhones Apple has ever sold have been sold during Tim Cook’s time as permanent CEO. What’s almost more interesting, though, is what’s happened to Mac and iPad sales, which performed roughly the same in the most recent quarter as they did five years ago: Apple Reporting/Jackdaw Research As you can see, both Mac and iPad sales were up just a few hundred thousand on those from five years earlier, despite the doubling of iPhone sales over the same period. As the earlier chart shows, for iPads that’s because sales first grew significantly, peaking at 26 million quarterly and 74 million over twelve months in Q4 2013 and falling since. Mac sales, too, have had better quarters than the most recent one, though the peak was not much higher than today. Both products are due for something of a rebound in the coming quarters, as new Mac are (hopefully) finally introduced and the iPad Pro trend continues to help sales. And it’s worth noting that 300 of the roughly 330 million total iPads sold to date have been sold under Tim Cook, along with almost 112 million Macs. Of course, we don’t have official shipment numbers for the Apple Watch, though there are various estimates out there. But it would be inappropriate to skip over that product entirely — it was the first brand-new product introduced in the Tim Cook era, and likely sold around 15 million units in its first year on the market. That’s a much faster run-rate than the iPhone, but down a little at this point on iPad sales in their first year. But it’s interesting that, as Tim Cook marks his five year anniversary, we’re seeing another product whose launch timeframe is being moved from the first half to the second half of the year, causing something of a lull in sales in the meantime. A changing mix of segment revenues All that movement in unit shipments obviously flows through to product revenues too. The revenue split by segment has changed fairly significantly over Tim Cook’s tenure. Apple’s financial reporting by segment has also changed over the last five years, with the iPod no longer separated out as its own reporting line, the Accessories bucket being merged with iPod, Apple Watch, Apple into “Other Products” and “iTunes, Software, and Services” becoming just “Services”. In the chart below, I’ve collapsed these segments for comparability: Apple Reporting, Jackdaw Research The iPhone, which was already a very significant portion of Apple’s overall revenue, has only become more dominant over the past five years, rising from 45% of revenue in the twelve months to Q2 2011 to 64% in the year to Q2 2016. But other components have also risen or fallen  —  iPad has dropped from 16% to 9% and Mac from 20% to 11%, while the combination of iPod, accessories, and various other hardware products has dropped quite a bit too. The only other segment that’s risen as a portion of the total during this time  —  despite the rapid growth of iPhone revenues  —  is Services. An increase from 9% to 10% of revenue doesn’t look like much, but it’s much more impressive when you look at the dollar amounts instead: Apple Reporting, Jackdaw Research What’s now the Services segment has grown from under $10 billion in the twelve months to Q2 2011 to well over $20 billion in the most recent twelve months, with the trajectory actually steepening in recent quarters. Yes, it’s still just 10% of total revenue over the past year, but it’s actually Apple’s fastest-growing segment at the moment. The other interesting thing to look at in the context of segment revenue is the difference between unit shipments and revenue performance, which is driven by changing average selling prices (ASPs). You can see it a little in iPhone revenues: Apple Reporting/Jackdaw Research By now, that iPhone trajectory should be familiar, but it’s worth noting the growth — from just over $40 billion on a twelve-month basis to $140 billion. It’s subtle, but the 3.1x growth in shipments has translated into a 3.5x growth in revenue, and that’s largely down to ASPs. Here are average selling prices on a trailing 4-quarter basis for the three major product lines at the beginning and end of Tim Cook’s first five years — note that because of changes in reporting structures I’ve used Q3 rather than Q2 2011 as the starting point here: Apple Reporting/Jackdaw Research As you can see, iPhone ASPs have risen over the five years despite the increasing maturity of the product and the introduction of two cheaper models (the iPhone 5c and more recently the iPhone SE). Mac ASPs have dropped, but only slightly, while iPad ASPs have dropped fairly significantly, driven by the launch of the iPad Mini in 2012 and the increasing tendency to keep older devices in the lineup for longer at lower prices. But something interesting has been happening to iPad revenues in recent quarters, even as shipments continue to fall year on year: Apple Reporting/Jackdaw Research This flattening of revenues, and the growth this past quarter, has been driven by the iPad Pro, which has raised ASPs considerably. iPad ASPs bottomed out at around $415 a year ago, but were $490 in Q2 2016, up $60 from Q1, putting them back at late 2012 levels. Regional trends and the rise of China One of the most dramatic changes at Apple in the Tim Cook era has been the rise of China as one of its two major markets. Here, again, unfortunately, we’re thwarted a little by a change in Apple’s reporting a few years back, in which it eliminated Retail as a separate segment and rolled it into the individual regions, so we’re going to use Q4 rather than Q2 2011 as our starting point, and for comparability we’ll use Q4 2015 as the end point. As such, we’re measuring a four-year rather than five-year period, but the changes are still very visible. Here’s the share of Apple’s revenue by region at those two points in time: Apple Reporting/Jackdaw Research As you can see, Greater China has increased massively as a proportion of revenue over this period, going from 10% to 24% of revenues, while every other region has shrunk in percentage terms. In Q4 2015, Greater China contributed the same percentage of revenue as Europe. Looking at the dollar amounts is again helpful — here’s actual revenue by region for those two quarters: Apple Reporting/Jackdaw Research It’s worth noting first that every region has grown during these four years, but Greater China has clearly grown far faster than any other region, from $4.5 billion to over $18 billion during this time. That’s massive growth, and I’d say it’s one of Tim Cook’s great achievements during his tenure. It’s also clearly something he hasn’t given up on, given his recent frequent visits to China and the investments in Didi and in an R&D center to be built there. It’s also worth looking at operating income by geography, because here too China has made a significant contribution: Apple Reporting/Jackdaw Research Retail is far more international I want to close out with Apple’s retail business, which gets less attention in Apple’s official reporting than it used to, since Retail has been wrapped into the regions, but is as important to Apple’s strategy as ever. And Tim Cook has been instrumental in expanding the Retail footprint, especially overseas, though Retail has also been the focal point of arguably Cook’s biggest blunder as CEO — the appointment of John Browett to run the business. However, Angela Ahrendts’ appointment seems to have more than made up for that mistake. Here are a couple of charts about Apple’s retail footprint: Apple Reporting, Jackdaw Research Apple Reporting, Jackdaw Research At the end of Q2 2011, Apple had a total of 327 retail stores, of which 236 or 72% were in the US. By the end of Q2 2016, Apple had 488 stores globally, of which 218 or 45% were now overseas. Tim Cook’s time as CEO has seen Apple stores opened in seven new countries across four continents: Apple Reporting/Jackdaw Research But of course it’s also seen a massive expansion in the number of Apple stores in China, which had 36 stores as of the end of July, up from single digits when Tim Cook took over. Conclusions I’ve deliberately made this more of a factual post than an evaluation of Tim Cook’s tenure — as I said up front, this week will see lots of this sort of stuff, and I’ve already talked to several reporters doing their best to sum up five years of work in a few hundred words. But I think it’s worth noting several things here, some of which I’ve mentioned in the text: Apple under Tim Cook has sold far more iPhones and iPads than it ever did under Steve Jobs — 87% of total iPhones sold and 90% of iPads ever sold. Though Steve Jobs launched these products, it was always Tim Cook who ensured the supply chain met demand as well as possible, and it’s been Tim Cook who’s overseen the massive expansion in that supply chain over the last five years as the scale has grown to something unprecedented. Tim Cook has made the decision to increase Apple’s spending on research and development not just in dollar terms commensurate with revenue growth but actually doubling it as a percentage of revenue during his tenure despite the massive growth in revenue. That reversed the trend under Steve Jobs, and the increased investment in R&D is roughly equivalent to the drop in margins during this time — Cook has made a massive bet on R&D and by implication on future products. Cook has made China a special focus, and this focus has paid off in a big way, with a roughly fourfold increase in revenue from Greater China and an equivalent increase in operating income. Greater China has grown from 10% of revenues to roughly a quarter, and Apple’s retail footprint there has also grown dramatically. That growth in China has been a major contributor to Apple’s overall growth in the last five years, and Cook clearly remains committed to China as a focus for Apple as evidenced by his recent investments there. He’s begun to talk more about India and its potential, but I remain skeptical that India can be much more than a rounding error for Apple over the next few years. Only one entirely new hardware product has launched under Tim Cook, and yet we have almost no official data to go on to evaluate the performance of the Apple Watch so far. Opinion remains divided about how to evaluate the Watch, but I’m on the side of those who considers it a modest success in Apple terms and a smash hit in the context of the market into which it was launched. Like the iPhone the year Tim Cook took over, it’s going through an interesting transition as its release moves from the first half to the second half of the year, but I suspect that like the iPhone in late 2011, the Watch is due for big growth in late 2016 and beyond. I suspect the transformation we’ve seen in Services, driven largely to date by the App Store and latterly by Apple Music, is just the start of what we’ll see under Tim Cook. He’s already hinted several times at additional services to come, and TV is an obvious focus here. But I also think some of the rhetoric about Services has been overblown — it’s still only 10% of revenue, and unlikely to grow massively past that point unless Apple decouples services from its devices, which I think would be a mistake. Perhaps one of the most significant contributions Tim Cook has made at Apple can’t be seen in any of these charts, because it’s about the changes to Apple’s culture that have happened under his leadership. The increased openness, best exemplified by the frequent interviews Cook and other executives now regularly grant to various publications (and even podcasters), is one element of this, though Apple’s secrecy about future products remains as tight as ever. But an increased sense of social responsibility, especially as regards the environment and contributions to social causes is another major change. This doesn’t have a direct financial impact, but it’s made a positive contribution nonetheless, and no evaluation of Cook’s tenure would be complete without a recognition of that fact.

More Comments Tumblr Pinterest Reddit Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon How do you replace Steve Jobs? People had tried before and failed: When Apple’s founder left amid a boardroom coup in 1985, the string of leaders that filled the void almost brought the company to its knees until Jobs’ triumphant return over a decade later. So when Jobs’ hand-picked successor, Tim Cook, took command on August 24, 2011 — five years ago this week — it was always bound to be one of the most-scrutinised handovers in corporate history. Jobs, who would die of pancreatic cancer 13 days later, had been a model of leadership and innovation. He had been central to the polished icons of the 21st century computing: the iPod, iPhone and iPad, bringing a flair that had made them seem like more than mere products. Related Stepping out of Steve Jobs’s shadow, Tim Cook champions the promise of Apple Inc Once taunted by co-founder Steve Jobs, companies are now big customers for Apple Inc Cook, meanwhile, was the less-visible chief operating officer; the master of the supply chain who rose at 4:30am every morning to keep the well-oiled machine ticking over. And though he was the obvious candidate to replace the irreplaceable, analysts doubted whether he would be able to keep the Apple magic alive. Five years later, the same questions persist. Few would deny he was the right man for the job, but under Cook, Apple has yet to release an undisputed hit product. The world’s biggest company While the line-up of products in Apple’s stores bears a resemblance to that of five years ago, the company Cook runs has been transformed. Under his tenure, Apple has become the world’s biggest public company, and twice broken the record for the biggest quarterly profit in history. The company has also doubled in size. During Jobs’ last full quarter as chief executive, Apple sold 20.3 million iPhones: it now sells more than double that. Its 110,000 staff today compare with just over 60,000 five years ago. When Jobs passed the baton, it had four stores in China, against 41 today. This monumental expansion has also put pressure on Apple over taxes and its swelling overseas cash pile, which Cook has said he is not ready to repatriate without US reform, despite pressures from agitated investors such as Carl Icahn to return more money to shareholders. The challenge has required a steady hand. Cook has had to appear in front of US politicians at high-profile hearings and charm European politicians investigating its tax affairs, as well as appease grumbling investors. His record here has been impressive: Apple’s share price has more than doubled under Cook. Innovation Apple, though, is not known for stock buy-backs; it is known for the life-changing product, the thing that consumers don’t know they want until they see it, at which point they positively need it. And while Jobs would surround himself with visionaries such as Sir Jonathan Ive, he was still the beating heart of these best-selling inventions. When Jobs stepped down, the key question was whether Apple would be able to continue its hot streak, and five years later, the jury is still out. One of the company’s first releases under Cook’s command was the disastrous Apple Maps, which missed entire towns and important transport links. Cook’s most significant new product has been last year’s Apple Watch, which has proved more of a niche product for committed consumers than a worldwide phenomenon. Sales to date are estimated at around 15?million, above average in an emerging wearable technology market, but barely moving the dial for a company of Apple’s proportions. Cook’s ability to keep Apple moving upwards has instead been rooted in growing sales of the iPhone, which have increased particularly impressively in markets such as China and India. The iPhone, though, makes up more than half of Apple’s sales – more than it did when Jobs stepped down, leading some to question if Apple is over-reliant on one thing. Cook recently described the popularity of the iPhone as “a privilege, not a problem,” but as the smartphone market has begun to saturate, it has seemed more like the latter: after 13 years of rising revenues, sales have fallen for the last two quarters. Criticism of Cook’s innovation record is often unfair, however: while Apple has continued to refresh its top products with new features, there is never likely to be another iPhone. Instead, Cook has focused on selling more of the software and services that live on the one billion iPhones and iPads in use today. Sales from apps and services increased by 19pc year on year in the last quarter. The services business includes Apple Music and Apple Pay – two of the more successful new products Apple has launched under Cook – and is now bigger than both the iPad and Mac computers. Social issues If there is one thing that has separated Cook from his predecessor, though, it has been in trying to make Apple not only a technological force, but a very public beacon for corporate responsibility. Cook has campaigned more than many for race and gender equality and gay rights: he became the most high-profile chief executive to come out as gay two years ago, and has made efforts to improve diversity amongst Apple’s workforce. Apple also became a figurehead for privacy activists this year when Cook refused to bow to the FBI’s demands that Apple unlock an iPhone used by a shooter involved in a terrorist attack in California last year, labelling the request a “dangerous precedent”. Cook eventually won the fight. On the day he took over from Jobs, Cook told staff: “I want you to be confident that Apple is not going to change,” On that point, at least, he was very wrong.

Photo: Apple Apple CEO Tim Cook is taking advantage of the monstrous bonus he unlocked on his fifth anniversary at the helm of Apple by selling 334,000 shares for a big payday. Priced between $107.21 to $107.69 per share, the stock dump netted Cook more than $35 million. Not a bad bonus for the most powerful man in tech. A recent SEC filing revealed that in order to comply with minimum statutory tax withholding requirements for the RSUs that vested on Tim Cook’s fifth anniversary, Apple sold 656,117 shares on his behalf. The Apple CEO still owns over 1.3 million shares worth over $140 million. Apple awarded Cook 980,000 Apple shares for his performance as part of the larger compensation package he signed in 2011.

Apple loves making their products as simple as possible. The iPod was a success because of how clean it looked compared to other MP3 players. With Apple TV, Steve Jobs bragged about how few buttons the device’s remote had. But since 2007, every new iPhone has had the same number of physical buttons, switches, and ports: A ringer switch, a lock button, volume up/down buttons, a USB port, and a headphone jack. That changes next month, when Apple is expected to announce that the iPhone 7 will be lacking a headphone jack. Instead, users will be listening to music via the Lightning port (which you currently use to charge and sync your iPhone). And for 2017, Apple will reportedly go one step further by removing the Home button. Ah, the Home button. It’s always been there for us — it’s our captain for navigating the iPhone. We use it to switch between apps, we use it to get to our Home screen, we use it to summon Siri, and we use it to read our finger print. Back in the “old days,” we used it to force quit apps when they froze on us. In a new report, Bloomberg says Apple is planning to remove the Home button for the 2017 iPhone, which will presumably be called iPhone 7s. It’s billed as a “major redesign of the iPhone for 2017 that focuses more heavily on the display.” Previous rumor mill reports have suggested that Apple will ditch the Home button in order to decrease the size of the top top and bottom bezels, thereby making the phone not as tall, or using the freed up space to add more screen. Here’s a mock up of what that could look like, via TapSmart: What remains unclear is how users will be able to unlock and navigate their iPhone without the Home button. Reports have suggested that the whole screen will serve as a TouchID surface and a Home button (using the 3D Touch feature Apple launched last year). Interestingly, next month’s release of iOS 10 will introduce a new way to unlock your iPhone: You’ll have to press down on the Home button to activate an unlocking. Previously, all you had to do was rest your finger on the Home button while your lock screen was awake.

My addiction Up until this year, I was one of the biggest pop culture connoisseurs that I knew. In fact, I used to pride myself on how much pop culture I could consume. It was a large part of my identity. Whenever anyone talked about how many shows they’d watch per week, I’d always low-key brag about averaging 15-17 shows a week and would enjoy the stunned looks on their faces. Those looks alone gave me a sort of feeling of accomplishment that I just couldn’t find elsewhere. Read full article 2016 was a year of many changes for me, but none were as shocking to me as my altered relationship with pop culture and fandom. My addiction Up until this year, I was one of the biggest pop culture connoisseurs that I knew. In fact, I used to pride myself on how much pop culture I could consume. It was a large part of my identity. Whenever anyone talked about how many shows they’d watch per week, I’d always low-key brag about averaging 15-17 shows a week and would enjoy the stunned looks on their faces. Those looks alone gave me a sort of feeling of accomplishment that I just couldn’t find elsewhere. In addition to watching (and keeping up with) an insane number of TV shows, I’d also see popular movies right when they were released and read about a book a week. This is all in addition to soaking up as much TV and movie news as possible. Over the years, my friends would come to know me as a pop culture knowledge database and pretty much get their news from me. In other words, pop culture was my life. It had been since I was a child and my savvyness peaked at the end of 2015. Pop culture was my lifeline when things in my personal or work life would go sour. I had Hypable, a packed TV calendar, a Netflix account, and a constant stream of exciting movies to see. What more could I want? But two things happened at the end of 2015 that would impact my 2016 more than I could’ve predicted: I decided that I wanted to finally quit my job and go on a trip through Europe (and I’d actually follow through with it). For the first time in my life, I experienced fandom fatigue and pop culture overload. I’ve always been someone who played it safe and planned ahead, so to not really know what was going to happen in my future and where I would be by the end of 2016 was terrifying. And yet, because of my (self-diagnosed) fandom fatigue, I couldn’t really turn to my pop culture comfort food because I just didn’t really want it. Of course, time marched on and 2016 arrived. My fandom fatigue slowly cleared up and I wouldn’t have to really face the life decision I made for myself until the summer. Things were slowly going back to normal for me. (Or so I thought.) Going cold turkey on pop culture Fast forward to the beginning of July. I left my job of three years and was getting ready to go on the trip of a lifetime: A month-long tour of Western Europe. With a group of 33 strangers. While I had a few of your typical fears (ie. “Did I just make the biggest mistake of my life?” and “What if I end up hating all of the people on my trip and spend a month alone?”), I was also afraid of missing out on any important pop culture news. So I did what any sane person would do: I set up a Google doc for my closest friends to drop news story links into while I was away. Mind you, I had been planning to create this Google doc for months. It wasn’t a last-minute inspired idea. It was premeditated. After all, I was basically throwing my entire life into chaos and couldn’t bear to lose my lifeline too. From July 8 to August 6, I traveled all around Western Europe with my EF College Break group, checking my Google doc whenever I had downtime. However, because I was in Europe, scanning the Google doc became more of a habitual thing rather than a compulsion. I didn’t even really check my social feeds as much as usual (which was quite a change for me considering that I basically lived on Twitter). I was surrounded by amazing places and people and didn’t really need much else beyond that. When I noticed my declining interest in pop culture news, I just chalked it up to being on vacation. But then when I came back, an odd thing happened: I couldn’t bring myself to power up my computer or open my social media apps on my phone. It just wasn’t something I wanted to do. I wanted to be outside exploring and living in the moment. My technology couldn’t give that to me. So, my feeds went practically unread for another full week (on top of the four I had been out of the country). Sure, I pushed out personal updates and musings, but I didn’t consume anything. Again, I just chalked up my mood to my post-trip depression. I’d be better in no time. But I wasn’t. Sure, I didn’t stay away from social media for too long, but I didn’t constantly scan and refresh my feeds like I used to. Speed-reading novels became exhausting so I stopped reading altogether. My 4th and 5th conventions of the year seemed more like a chore than a treat. Motivating myself to write started to require a lot of effort and strain. And movies? Well, I saw Suicide Squad the day after I came home, but didn’t see another movie in theaters for at least a month. And then there’s the fall TV season. I started out with about 18 shows and almost immediately fell behind on half of them. For a little while, I felt like I was letting myself down. I was no longer up on all of the news in the fandom world nor was I even up to date with my shows. What was happening to me? I’m a Hypable writer! Fandom is in my blood! My pop culture hunger was abating. After going from feeling overloaded to completely depriving myself of pop culture, my system was in a sort of shock and was trying to figure out where my happy medium lies. Not only was my enthusiasm and craving for these things waning, but I was also experiencing some pretty awful side effects. I was irritable more often than not and found myself having trouble concentrating on simple things. I also agonized over how I was going to fit everything I wanted to do and everything I needed to do into a 24/7-shaped box. In other words, I was a miserable mess. Something had to give. I needed to rethink my involvement and enthusiasm for fandom. Quality over quantity Knowing that, in my heart, I didn’t want to go cold turkey once again on the entertainment that I loved, I began to cut back. On everything. I started cancelling episode and series recordings on my DVR. I no longer forced myself to catch up from where I last left off on each of my social feeds before I went to bed and after I woke up in the morning. I decided that paring down my pop culture consumption was the best thing for me. I started focusing on enjoying the things I loved most and tabling everything else. In other words, I adopted a sort of “quality over quantity” mindset. (To be clear, when I say “quality,” I’m not referring to the fandom entities themselves. I’m not commenting on their inherent value or if I think they’re good or bad. I’m simply categorizing them by their importance to me. The things I get true entertainment and value out of that I don’t want to live without.) The shows I made an effort to watch ASAP (live or via DVR) remained on my TV calendar and those I found myself skipping over were cut out. Pretty soon, I was only regularly watching about half (if that) of the 18 shows a week I had initially put into my fall TV calendar. My quality over quantity mission didn’t just go for TV, however. Instead of getting excited for every. single. movie. release that was fandom related and feeling compelled to see them all, I kept my expectations in check. Low-balled a few of them, even. There are still must-see movies for me, don’t get me wrong. But I no longer feel guilty over not being excited or motivated to see some fandom-related ones. To this day, I still haven’t seen the most recent Star Trek, X-Men, and Ghostbusters movies (to name a few), even though I’ve seen and enjoyed their predecessors. They’re just not that high on my to-watch list. Sure, there are a few downsides to my new “quality over quantity” approach to pop culture and media. Because I no longer push myself to catch up on my social media feeds (namely Twitter), I feel like I’m missing out on the lives of my internet friends. I could very well be missing out on new pop culture gems (like Speechless). I’ve given up on shows and franchises that I’ve enjoyed and invested myself in in the past. It hasn’t been an easy transition for me by any means, but the rewards have outweighed the losses. The aftermath After making the change to how I consumed and interacted with pop culture, I started seeing positive shifts in my everyday life. I found myself feeling less burdened and stressed. I’ve been able to start really enjoying the media I’m consuming without being bogged down by guilt over other things I should be watching or reading instead. I’m not saying that limiting my intake solved all of my problems, but it definitely helped. Ever since I’ve started focusing on the things I love the most instead of trying to muster high levels of enthusiasm for a wide array of things, I’ve found myself coming back around to pop culture and fandom. Watching shows is becoming enjoyable again and my motivation to write is (thankfully) returning. I don’t think I’ll ever get back to consuming as much as I was before 2016 hit, but I no longer dread engaging with pop culture and media as I once did. It’s true that 2016 was an awful year in many ways but, as I sit here writing this while watching Return of the Jedi in honor of Carrie Fisher, I’m thankful that it has forced me to reprioritize the role of pop culture and fandom in my life. If it weren’t for my 2016 reality check, I’d be sitting here stressing over watching something off of my DVR or doing some other fandom-related task rather than watching my favorite Star Wars movie for the umpteenth time in memory of one of my favorite female role models. Pop culture used to be my life and, for years, I accepted that. I embraced it to the point where it was a large part of identity. But, in 2016, that got to be too stressful and I realized that the way I was interacting with it just wasn’t sustainable for me anymore. While it’s no longer my entire life, it is still an important part of who I am. That will never change. I’m now just approaching it in a way that’s healthier for me and allows me to enjoy everything to the fullest. Thanks to 2016 and my new “quantity over quality” motto, I finally feel free to enjoy pop culture in the way that’s best for me in 2017 and beyond.

Read full article As the news broke that Carrie Fisher had died, people from all corners of the world, all walks of life, came together to mourn her death. I’ve struggled with how to deal with that overwhelming feeling of grief myself, how to channel it, how to quantify this emptiness I’ve felt since learning of Carrie Fisher’s passing. And so I thought I’d take a leaf out of her book and do what she did best. Talk about it. Carrie Fisher entered my life the way she did for so many people, as Princess Leia Organa, taking charge of an impossible situation and leading with confidence, conviction, and strength in the face of losing her whole world. It was like nothing I’d ever seen before. I was in love. I wanted to be her. And for the longest time, I was her. Walking in the steps that Leia first tread, from A New Hope to Empire Strikes Back, I learnt that it was okay to be outspoken about what I believed in, what I loved, what I wanted to stand for. I found my own voice through Leia and her steadfast belief in the rebellion against the Empire, and I refused to let anyone silence it. Society dictated I had to behave a certain way, love in a conventional manner, and temper my passion to acceptable outlets for a young woman. But that just wasn’t me. Thanks to Leia, I learned to find who I loved in my own time and my own way, I refused to allow my passions to be quashed, and I led, I fought, and I rebelled. I’m sure, for most, I came across as somewhat headstrong and stubborn, but I was also fiercely loyal and stood steadfast for myself and for everyone around me. That’s not to say that that path was always easy. But where Leia forged it, Carrie Fisher was there to take my hand when I faltered. Throughout my late teens and into my adult life I struggled — and continue to struggle — with my mental health. There’s a bone deep exhaustion, mentally and physically, that goes hand in hand with fighting and continuing to fight against cultural conditioning. Against the expectations of your family. As I grew and discovered what made me me, I railed more against those expectations. My sexuality wasn’t nearly as clear cut as I thought it might be. I was moving away from the familiarity of home and into isolation. I suffered from a painful, and chronic condition, that often left me in bed — and one that my doctors either brushed off, or didn’t have the answer for. I was exaggerating, I was dramatic, I was confused, I was any number of words at the same time, except for one: true. The stigma attached to mental health issues was so ingrained in both myself, and the people around me, that silence seemed to be the only acceptable option. And so I internalized it. Kept it locked deep in my gut and swallowed down the words whenever I thought they might spill out of me. Right up until I thought I might choke on them. Which was when Carrie found me all over again. In 2006, when I felt out of my depth and fighting a losing battle against my own mind, struggling with slowly losing a family member to an illness that turned her mind against her, I stumbled on a documentary called The Secret Life of the Manic Depressive, and there she was. The Princess that defined my childhood, redefining how I looked at my mental health. How I looked at myself. It was like a dam had burst and I started searching for her words outside of the ones I could recite by heart. I devoured Postcards from the Edge, and every interview I could dig up — be they by page, or footage I managed to find online. Then there was Shockaholic and Wishful Drinking in 2008, the former of which has now become dog-eared from reading and rereading, letting every inch of it soak into me, bone deep. The more that I read, the less alone I felt. And I broke my silence. I talked about my struggles, first with friends, then with a professional. I refused to be browbeaten by doctors regarding my pain, or shamed. I found myself again, through that fog, and held on tight. As Carrie refused to be painted as a histrionic woman with mental health issues, so too did I. That fight will never truly be over, but I know the strength of my own voice, of taking the time for self-care, and to live my life, though my mind may try and drag me down every step of the way. Carrie lived her life openly, allowing us an intimate look at her struggles as well as her triumphs. She stood firm in the face of sexism, the stigmas about mental illness, and she did so with a humour that struck a chord with so many of us. In her own words from Shockaholic, “After death takes someone from you, it gives you something back. It makes smells sharper and the sun brighter and sex more urgent. It’s as though you’re living for two now. Their memory lives inside you, and you feed it. You live for them now that they can’t anymore.” That legacy lives on in all of us. In me. Carrie’s words helped me through some of my darkest days. Her continued presence in the advent of social media kept her at my back, as though she was urging me to keep pressing forward. Those words will never die. But now it’s our time to add to them. The baton is at our feet. At mine. I’m picking it up.

Read full article The latest Netflix original The OA premiered last Friday and now that we’ve had a full week to think it over, here’s our review. You may not be aware that The OA came out since its marketing campaign began just a few days before the actual release, but this show is definitely one of the best originals the streaming giant has put out. Well, I say best but some friends have said it’s the worst. If anything The OA has been extremely polarizing since people have finished it, and for good reason. The OA centers around Prairie, a woman who has been missing for the past seven years. Prairie was blind when she got abducted and the series begins with her finding her way back home now with the ability to see and a very complicated history to explain. She confides in five strangers to tell her story to, and that’s where our journey begins. It’s almost impossible to discuss The OA without spoiling at least some aspects of it. The show is one of those things that is best watched when you have no idea what it’s really about, so consider these first few paragraphs your spoiler-free review: Watch it. It’s great. Now that we got that out of the way it’s time to talk about why I think this show is so fantastic, so here’s your spoiler warning for those who haven’t seen it yet. When this show’s marketing campaign first started I wasn’t sure how to feel about it. Another story about a missing person? Haven’t we already had, like, tons of those? But this isn’t just some story about a missing person, this is the story about a girl who believes she is The Original Angel. The reveal of what OA stands for blew my mind, along with my roommate’s who I dragged into watching. The show may start off as this story about a girl born in Russia but then turns into a whole new beast when we meet Katoon, someone who I can only describe as Prairie’s guardian angel of some sort. That is when we get into the realm of angels and death and that is when my interest in this show multiplied by a thousand. The OA‘s entire concept revolves around near death experiences, or NDEs for short, and how some people who experience them come back with incredible talents like musical abilities or language proficiency. This is a real thing – people have actually had NDEs and are then reported to have incredible abilities they didn’t have before. I think that’s why I’m so in love with this show, because it takes a concept that is real and then explores the fantastical aspects. But it’s not the concept of the show that people have a problem with, it’s the ending. So let’s get into the nitty gritty, shall we? Prairie, who I’ll be calling OA from this point forward since that’s her preferred name, escaped her town to look for her biological father. Given that she’s blind and won’t be able to find him easily she’s convinced that her ability to play the violin (which her father taught her) will call him to her. Her musical talents definitely get noticed but not by the man she was hoping for. Cue Jason Isaacs, who all Harry Potter fans will know as Lucius Malfoy. Isaacs plays Hap, a man who believes in the incredible effects of NDEs and wants to study them. He finds OA playing in the New York subway and manages to befriend her and convince her to come stay with him at his home. Turns out that he had no intention of playing friendly host to a stranger, and in fact OA is just one of six other people who have also experienced NDEs that Hap has abducted. Hap kept these people in what’s essentially a large glass cage with six different compartments. It’s unsettling to watch OA sit on the bed in that cage, thankful for having a place to sleep only to realize moments later that the door was locked and she’s trapped in a tiny room, a place she’ll be for the next seven years. Over those next seven years OA begins to understand what’s happening. Hap believes that when people have near death experiences they cross over into the after life which is exactly what he’s trying to study. He wants to prove the existence of angels and the afterlife and these five people he currently has are his key to unlocking that mystery. In one of OA’s NDEs she is told by Katoon how she can free herself, and that’s to learn the Five Movements. Each of the captives (except one) are eventually given one movement and when performed together they can open a tunnel through time and space to escape captivity. In the end OA manages to escape only because she was able to run away, leaving her friends in captivity with Hap. By this time they’ve learned the five movements and Hap threatened to use them to take her friends somewhere she’ll never be able to find them. Fast forward to the end of the series, OA has managed to convince the five strangers she met at the beginning of the show that her story is true. They believe what she has to say and they start learning the five movements because OA hopes to use them to help her get back to her friends. The series ends in a startling school shooting that provokes OA and her five friends to try and use the five movements they’ve learned to prevent the shooter from hurting anyone. The manage to finish the movements in spectacular fashion but in the end a school employees knocks down the shooter who fires one last shot that lands in OA’s chest. She’s carted away in the ambulance and we’re left wondering if the five movements were ever really real, or if OA’s story was real at all. This is where people start to hate the show, and for good reason. We’ve just spent seven and a half episodes being told a fantastical story about angels and near death experiences and when the moment of truth comes it all falls flat. Nothing happens. No tunnel opens, time doesn’t freeze, it’s just very anti-climactic. The FBI shows up and shows OA’s friends books about NDEs, the Oligarchs, angels and The Odyssey, all of which OA kept in her room. They’re trying to tell us that this was all fake, that OA was sick and she made the whole thing up. But that’s the genius of it all. Having watched the story from OA’s perspective and seeing things that OA experiences we’re left wondering if it was real. It’s playing on the entire concept of believing in angels. We can choose to believe the power that OA had and her experiences or we can debunk it, leaving it up to coincidence and mental illness. We won’t know if OA’s story was real or not until season 2, if that gets green lit, and that’s why I love it. There are so many things we can dissect about this show and decode that it’s very plausible that OA’s story was actually true and the FBI is trying to cover it up. You can choose to believe that or you can choose to be disappointed in a show that spent 8 hours fooling you. Whatever you decide I think it’s clear that this show has easily been one of Netflix’s most captivating. Do you believe in ‘The OA’?

(AAPL) iPhone Tip: Home Button Would Be Removed in 2017 Next year is the 10th anniversary of the iPhone and Apple seems to have big plans for it Published By: Ken Bock on August 26, 2016 09:49 am EST Facebook Google+ Twitter Pinterest Stumbleupon AAPL Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is tipped again today to launch an iPhone, for the first time, without its signature Home button in 2017. The Home button is as old as it gets for Apple’s mainstream signature touches to its products, but it looks like the Home button’s time might be up as Apple gears up to launch its first iPhone with Organic Light Emitted Diode (OLED) display technology next year. According to a latest report by the Bloomberg, Apple seeks to design the next iPhone so that it looks like a “sheet of glass” on the front. The Home button would, of course, be an obstacle in the way of making the next iPhone look like a sheet of glass on the front, which is why Apple is rumored to be doing away with its long-standing Home button. However, as a consequence of this step, the fingerprint scanner would then have to be integrated into the display itself. Some of the other changes tipped for next year’s major iPhone refresh are an OLED display, introduction of the magnetic Smart Connector, and for the first time, an iPhone with a curved display. An all-glass form-factor has also been spoken of in some rumors, further solidifying the case for Apple’s reported complete redesign of iPhone for 2017. In other news, Bloomberg has also reported that Apple could include Sony’s FeLica chip in its next iPhone that would allow users to pay for their mass-transit fee using their iPhone.

Apple issued a security update for those devices Thursday after researchers discovered spyware that turns hand-held Apple devices into the mother of all snoops, allowing remote operators to intercept all voice and data communications and pass along every photograph and video. Researchers said spyware had never been found before this month that could “jailbreak” an iPhone or iPad and seize total control of its functions. Efforts to use the spyware have surfaced in Mexico and the United Arab Emirates, where critics of the government appear to have been targeted for surveillance. “There’s pretty much nothing that this spyware couldn’t get off the iPhone,” said Bill Marczak, one of two researchers at the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto who discovered the spyware. “It’s a total and complete compromise of the phone.” Thursday’s development is a hit on the reputation of Apple products as largely hack-proof, and it raises questions over whether the spyware is in widespread use by authoritarian governments around the world. Advertisement The Israeli company thought to have produced the spyware said in a statement that it insisted that governments that bought its products use them only in lawful ways. Coding in the spyware indicates it has been around since 2013. The spyware’s existence also calls into question the security of widely used encrypted communications programs such as WhatsApp and Telegram, both of whose contents can be intercepted on a compromised device before they are scrambled, according to a San Francisco cyber forensics company, Lookout, that joined Citizen Lab in the probe. The story of how the researchers uncovered the spyware and the evidence of its use is worthy of a spy novel itself. Marczak and a colleague, John Scott-Railton, began tracking the spyware, which they call the Trident exploit, after a human rights defender in the United Arab Emirates alerted researchers to suspicious text messages. The rights activist, Ahmed Mansoor, received a text message on his iPhone on the morning of Aug. 10. It said in Arabic: “New secrets about torture of Emiratis in state prisons,” and contained a hyperlink to an unknown site. A similar text message arrived the next day. TNS Human rights activist Ahmed Mansoor was recently targeted by spyware that can hack into Apple’s iPhone handset. The company said Thursday it has updated its security. (Martin Ennals Foundation) Mansoor was wary. He’d already been targeted by other attempts. In all cases, the text messages were bait to get him to click on a link, which would have led to the infection of his Apple iPhone 6 and the control of the device through spying software created by NSO Group, a shadowy Israeli surveillance company, Marczak said. Marczak and his colleague infected a test iPhone of their own and “watched as unknown software was remotely implanted on our phone,” the two said in a report. They then contacted Lookout to help in reverse-engineering the spyware. They quickly learned that the infection would have turned Mansoor’s iPhone into a pocket undercover spy “capable of employing his iPhone’s camera and microphone to eavesdrop on activity in the vicinity of the device, recording his WhatsApp and Viber calls, logging messages sent in mobile chat apps and tracking his movements.” Viber is another common communications program. NSO Group, based in Herzliya, on the northern outskirts of Tel Aviv, was founded in 2010 and describes itself as a leader in “cyber warfare” and a vendor of surveillance software to governments around the world. It maintains no website and keeps a low profile. The Citizen Lab report said NSO Group had been sold to a San Francisco private equity group, Francisco Partners Management LLC, in 2014. A call of inquiry to that group led an NSO Group spokesman, Zamir Dahbash, to call McClatchy. He offered a statement that said the company’s mission was “to help make the world a safer place” and that it sold only to authorized government agencies to help them “combat terror and crime.” NSO Group does not operate any of its systems, he said, only selling the software. “The agreements signed with the company’s customers require that the company’s products only be used in a lawful manner. Specifically, the products may only be used for the prevention and investigation of crimes,” Dahbash said. He would answer no further questions and would not confirm that the company had contracts with any agencies of the UAE government or with the government of Mexico, where another case emerged of efforts to infect iPhones with NSO spyware. As the researchers traced the activities of their own infected iPhone, it led to an infrastructure of some 200 websites and servers used by NSO Group. The team then punched in the internet addresses to Google and Twitter “to see if anybody was sharing links to them,” Marczak said. That’s when they came across a tweet by Rafael Cabrera, a Mexican editor who works for Aristegui Online, a muckraking portal that has repeatedly broken stories on alleged influence trafficking by President Enrique Pena Nieto and his wife. Cabrera noted in the tweet that he’d gotten a “weird” text message that seemed to bait him to click on a suspicious link. “We realized, oh my gosh, this guy received links which were connected to these websites that we connected to NSO Group,” Marczak said. Cabrera, trapped in a traffic jam in Mexico City, said in a brief cellular phone interview that three members of Aristegui Online had been targeted with the text messages. In addition to himself, the portal’s lead investigator, Daniel Lizarraga, and another prominent journalist, Salvador Camarena, received texts. All were on the team that in November 2014 revealed that Pena Nieto’s wife had received a $7 million mansion from one of the government’s biggest contractors. The team also took part, along with McClatchy and scores of other media outlets around the world, in the probe of the Panama Papers, the trove of documents from a Panamanian law firm that opened a window earlier this year on the murky world of offshore shell companies. More: Panama Papers detail how ex-ambassador helped Russian company Among the revelations from the documents was that the contractor who had built the mansion for the Mexican first lady had also sought to create a string of offshore trusts and companies to hide more than $100 million. Cabrera said he could not pin blame on who might have wanted to spy on his iPhone. “I can’t say if it was an individual or if it was the government,” Cabrera said. The type of spyware sold by NSO Group routinely costs at least $1 million, according to a report by Lookout, making it a tool available mainly to governments. Apple Inc. was notified by Citizen Lab and Lookout on Aug. 15 of the vulnerability in the iPhones and iPads, and it said the security update provided Thursday blocked the use of Trident spyware. “We advise all of our customers to always download the latest version of iOS to protect themselves against potential security exploits,” Apple spokesman Fred Sainz said in an email. But Marczak said Apple devices, like all others, faced an increasing onslaught from malware. “Nothing is hack-proof, really,” he said. “There’s always ways into these devices.” ___ (c)2016 McClatchy Washington Bureau Visit the McClatchy Washington Bureau at www.mcclatchydc.com Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

We’re most likely only a matter of weeks away from Apple releasing the iPhone 7 and with it, iOS 10, so it’s a little surprising to see Apple pushing out one last point release for iOS 9. Still, that’s what it has done, but not with a focus on new features or functionality. Where iOS 9.3.4 largely existing to lock down a route to jailbreaking, iOS 9.3.5 instead addresses some serious "zero day" exploits that could leave your data exposed to malicious parties. Apple’s security advisory for iOS 9.3.5 states that it addresses exploits that could affect the operating kernel, memory corruption issues and the possibility for malicious web sites to execute arbitrary code on your iOS 9 device. While the company that originally identified the exploits noted that previously they would only have been used against specific high-value targets, with the publicity around them it’s more likely that criminal types would add them to their arsenal of exploits, so updating would be exceptionally wise. How do I update my iOS device? If you haven’t already been prompted to do so, head to Settings>General>Software Update. If you’re running an applicable device (which is pretty much any iOS 9-capable gadget) you should be prompted to download the update and apply it. As it encompasses the code found in iOS 9.3.4, that does mean that if you’re using a jailbroken iPhone or iPad, it will remove the jailbreak. What does this mean for iOS 10? It appears at this stage that the exploits in question don’t apply to iOS 10, so if you’re running the beta version of iOS 10 on your device, you should be secure, at least until malicious types work out the next exploit.

Subscribe for $59/Yr - Save $50 Spotify Said to Be Burying Songs by Artists With Apple Deals Rivalry Heats Up as Streaming Service Escalates Efforts Against Apple, Tidal Published on August 26, 2016. Most Popular An escalating battle between Apple and Spotify is leaving some musicians caught in the crossfire. Spotify has been retaliating against musicians who introduce new material exclusively on rival Apple Music by making their songs harder to find, according to people familiar with the strategy. Artists who have given Apple exclusive access to new music have been told they won't be able to get their tracks on featured playlists once the songs become available on Spotify, said the people, who declined to be identified discussing the steps. Those artists have also found their songs buried in the search rankings of Spotify, the world's largest music-streaming service, the people said. Spotify has been using such practices for about a year, one of the people said, though others said the efforts have escalated over the past few months. Artists who have given exclusives to Tidal, the streaming service run by Jay Z, have also been retaliated against, the person said, declining to identify specific musicians. Related Stories Apple Stymying Competition by Blocking App Update, Says Spotify Music Playlists Can Now Be Sponsored on Spotify How Spotify Harnesses Data to Connect With Its 75 Million Users Apple's music service has emerged as the largest challenger to Spotify over the past year, signing up more than 15 million subscribers since its debut last June, the company said two months ago. Exclusive deals for new music from artists such as Drake, Chance the Rapper and Frank Ocean are central to Apple's strategy. Spotify has more than 30 million subscribers globally. Apple Music also has ways to promote artists, such as highlighting their songs in its Top Tracks section, giving it ways to play favorites with musicians. The dustup over exclusives comes at a critical time for Spotify, which is in the midst of renegotiating licensing contracts with the world's biggest record labels. The company is aiming to hold an initial public offering by the end of next year, but needs more favorable long-term agreements with the labels to attract a higher valuation from investors, according to a person familiar with the plans. The company isn't profitable despite generating more than $2 billion in revenue, in part because it has to give 55% of the money to labels and an additional cut to publishers. It's not clear whether major artists like Drake and Ocean have been affected by Spotify's measures, and their representatives didn't respond to questions. In any case, artists of their stature need less help from Spotify to draw attention to their music, emerging acts rely on the service to find new listeners. The company has threatened to use its retaliatory practices on lesser-known artists who introduce music on a Beats One show hosted by DJ Zane Lowe, an architect of Apple's radio service, the people said. One representative of a singer-songwriter said the client canceled plans to debut a song on Mr. Lowe's show because of concern that the artist would lose promotion from Spotify. The agent asked not to be identified, and that the artist not be named, to avoid damaging relationships with the music-streaming companies. Mr. Lowe, a former BBC radio host, has introduced new tracks from his first day on the air with Beats One, and his show has become an important platform to debut songs worldwide. Apple and Spotify have been feuding since before Apple Music's debut, and competition between the two ratcheted up again in the past several weeks after Apple proposed changing songwriting royalties in a way that would increase costs for competitors like Spotify by putting its music in a different category that requires a higher rate. Spotify has also accused Apple of blocking a new version of its iPhone app, the latest volley in an ongoing dispute over Apple's cut of sales from its app store. Apple denied blocking Spotify's app, saying its rival hadn't met its terms of service. Led by former record executive Jimmy Iovine, Apple Music has kept its strategy flexible to appeal to what an artist wants. In the case of Frank Ocean and Drake, the company paid for exclusives. With Adele and Beyonce, it agreed to keep the music off its streaming service and initially only make it available for a paid download. The company also has been appealing to artists and industry executives by limiting its streaming service to paying subscribers and not having a free advertising-supported version like Spotify. Spotify has decried exclusive deals as harmful to musicians, fans and the growing business of music streaming. However, it has sought to make exclusive deals with some artists, such as rock band the 1975, but refused to limit the release to the company's paid service only, as labels and musicians have sought, two of the people said. Spotify has said a robust free service is needed to attract new users who can eventually become subscribers. Record labels are still pushing Spotify to let artists release music for paying subscribers only, and have yet to sign new long-term deals with the service as a result. Yet Apple's ability to attract those big exclusives may also be in jeopardy. In an internal memo this week, Lucian Grainge, chief executive officer of Vivendi SA's Universal Music Group, directed the heads of his company's labels to stop giving any music services long-term exclusives, according to two people familiar with the matter. Universal has sold Apple many of its biggest exclusives, including Drake. -- Bloomberg News In this article: Digital Entertainment Music Technology Become a Member Register Now Renew Membership Benefits Datacenter Advertising Age     Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Instagram YouTube Tumblr Copyright © 1994-2016 Crain Communications Privacy Statement Terms of Use About Us Advertise Reprints Contact Us AD AGE Creativity LookBook Datacenter Resources Events Jobs On Campus Site by AREA 17 x Scroll to Continue

For years, this cash has been building up due to the company’s massive success in global sales,” Kumquat Research writes for Seeking Alpha. “However, U.S. tax law states that profits American-based corporations earn beyond the country’s borders are to be taxed at the U.S. corporate tax rate of 35% when those profits are brought back to the states, or repatriated.” “Many companies think this is a unfair tax policy and so it has become common practice for large corporations to keep cash earned overseas ‘indefinitely reinvested’ to avoid paying the 35% tax. Apple’s cash pile accounts for close to 10% of the more than $2 trillion in profits U.S. corporations currently hold offshore, so repatriation tax reform that allows Apple to bring its cash home should be seen as a huge positive catalyst for AAPL shares should reform actually come to pass,” Kumquat Research writes. “Is this likely to happen anytime soon? I think it will.” “Both presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have proposed massive infrastructure spending on a scale that candidates haven’t proposed in a long while. Infrastructure has never been sexy, but now it has come into the spotlight as the crumbling nature of America’s roads, bridges, tunnels and other structures have become abundantly clear,” Kumquat Research writes. “Clinton has proposed $275 billion in infrastructure spending and Trump has proposed more than double that. How do they propose to pay for this spending? Trump has explicitly mentioned repatriation while Clinton has discussed business tax reform, likely an implicit reference to repatriation.” It is the best interest of “both Democrats and Republicans in Congress, to get repatriation reform done as quickly as possible so that other countries cannot make claims to the overseas cash of corporations that would pay U.S. taxes if they weren’t so high,” Kumquat Research writes. “With this catalyst and the need for funds to spend on infrastructure, repatriation reform seems imminent. Once it happens, the influx of cash for Apple will be a huge boon for the company and stock as well.” Read more in the full article here. MacDailyNews Take: Again, if the EU demands so-called “back taxes” from Apple, it’ll be based invisible legal grounds since the company simply followed the law when paying their taxes: There was no special deal that we cut with Ireland. We simply followed the laws in the country over the 35 years that we have been in Ireland. If the question is, was there ever a ‘quid pro quo’ that we were trying to strike with the Irish government – that was never the case. We’ve always been very transparent with the Irish government that we wanted to be a good corporate citizen… If countries change the tax laws, we will abide by the new laws and we will pay taxes according to those laws. – Apple CFO Luca Maestri As we wrote back in April: Apple has repeatedly and confidently stated that they didn’t do anything that was against the law. Therefore, unless the EC tries to change the law retroactively, if that’s even possible, or tries to collect taxes retroactively in some other fashion, Apple is in the clear.

Canadian Observer Saturday, August 27, 2016 - 1:56 pm · Reply I really wanted Bernie to win. He was too clean and honest for the job, apparently. Despite decades of trying, nobody has brought any charges up against Hillary. Her sin is that she’s been effective in playing the political games just as any slimy politician does. But nothing worse than hypocritical pathological liars like the GOP leadership, and certainly nothing as tacky and immature as the crap Trump spouts daily. I know, everything is the fault of the leader. We should all personally blame Cook for the dumb ass mistake that one of Ive’s designers made when he moved the power button on the iPhone from the top to the side directly across from the volume buttons. We should all curse Cook personally for that. So it goes with all presidents and presidential candidates. Just as partisan assholes personally blamed FDR for Pearl Harbor, the same lunatic fringe assumes Clinton was personally involved in Libya. Do you really think any leader has that close attention to detail with real time impact? Not a chance. GWB was too stunned during story time to do ANYTHING at the time of the 9/11/2001 tragedy. Mid-level response was instant, but the president was mentally AWOL. The right wing was silent. Later GWB sends >5000 Americans to their death in an offensive retaliatory invasion of Iraq, and the right wing cheers. Under the Obama administration, Sasam Hussein is captured, the troops are mostly returned home, but 4 people die in an embassy due to lack of communication on the part of a mid-level bureaucrat, and the right wingers bring out he pitchforks for Hillary and Obama. Consistency? No, what we hear instead from paid partisan hacks like botvinnick and First-whatever is brainless attacks without any evidence of legal wrongdoing. Quick to judge the other side, zero admittance of failures for the home team. You may not like Hillary, but if you can’t bring evidence of lawbreaking, then STFU. Same goes for Trump critics. Everyone knows he’s a narrow-minded uneducated asshole. But in America, displaying ignorance and incivility is freedom. Now can we get back to Apple news please? botvinnik✓ᵀᴿᵁᴹᴾ Saturday, August 27, 2016 - 2:58 pm · Reply here’s some more incivility: fück you, Hoser…take care of your own country. botvinnik✓ᵀᴿᵁᴹᴾ Thursday, August 25, 2016 - 5:47 pm · Reply “We are going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.” – Hillary Merkel, Democrat nominee for the presidency of the United States, March, 2016. JimBob Thursday, August 25, 2016 - 8:50 pm · Reply The sooner the better, too. I am sick of paying the real costs of coal. The market price of coal is cheap, but the societal cost is higher than any form of energy. Start with the miners who suffer from black lung disease – not only have the coal companies systematically used doctors on their payroll to avoid paying claims (see https://www.publicintegrity.org/2013/10/29/13585/coal-industrys-go-law-firm-withheld-evidence-black-lung-expense-sick-miners ), think about what a black lung disease payment is – you get money that corresponds to the years of your life lost because of your (preventable) exposure to coal dust in the mines and processing facilities. And while you only get the benefit if you are totally disabled from your employment in the coal industry, you do are not eligible for any disability payments, long-term care etc. and every dollar you do get paid offsets your other federal benefits such as Social Security. Black lung disease has has been a cause or contributing factor in the death of more than 76,000 miners since 1968. Add in hundreds of electrocutions, crush injuries, mechanical entanglements, rollovers and whatnot to that total. At the mine site itself, there’s all kinds of environmental mayhem going on – streams being filled in and poisoned, entire mountaintops blasted off, strip mining, etc. and the supposed “reclamation” of the land leaves behind land completely unsuitable for any activity or ecosystem. They tried building a federal prison on one of these mountaintop removal sites (Big Sandy) – The $2 million project went over budget by close $40 million because the fill they built it on was so unstable, it caused all kinds of cracks and foundation problems. Our taxpayer dollars at work. Further, coal trucks routinely travel state and federal highways grossly overloaded, adding millions of dollars of road maintenance fees and expenses that the taxpayer picks up. And on the way to their delivery point, these poorly maintained and overweight trucks have killed hundreds of average folks who happened to be traveling on the same road. Their shattered lives, disabilities and whatever are all picked up by someone else. Coal-fired power plants are the most polluting energy source on the planet. The CO2 issue (anthropogenic climate change is settled science; dont even start) alone would be bad enough, but the average coal plant emits more radioactivity than a comparable nuclear plant, and spews mercury into the environment where it bioaccumulates. The air pollution alone causes or exacerbates hundreds of thousands of asthma cases each year and contributes annually to up 15,000 premature deaths in the US alone. All at no charge to the coal or power company who can freely pollute. Once you’re done burning the coal, you’re left with fly ash. Which by any definition of the term is hazardous waste but, thanks to coal company lobbyists, is exempt from those regulations. It’s dumped anywhere and everywhere – and every year or two a giant slurry pond wipes out another town or ecosystem with taxpayers or ratepayers picking up the tab. Uncovered piles of coal ash laden with heavy metals run off into our ecosystem, or just fly on the winds. Any number of towns, prisons, and more are on or adjacent to these piles with predictable health consequences, all picked up, again, by the taxpayer. If coal were taxed to cover the full societal impact it would more expensive than all other forms of energy by an order of magnitude. All that said, we do need a very small amount of anthracite coal for steel making and related activities, but using this stuff to supply energy is just a horrid and immoral choice. botvinnik✓ᵀᴿᵁᴹᴾ Thursday, August 25, 2016 - 9:20 pm · Reply “In 2015, the United States generated about 4 trillion kilowatthours of electricity. About 67% of the electricity generated was from fossil fuels (coal, natural gas, and petroleum).” Enjoy your darkness and cold, idiot. botvinnik✓ᵀᴿᵁᴹᴾ Thursday, August 25, 2016 - 9:23 pm · Reply …better yet, move to North Korea, they don’t have any use for electricity there either…you’ll fit right in. JimBob Friday, August 26, 2016 - 11:03 am · Reply Ah, yes, once again, you are unable to provide a cogent response or rebuttal so you respond with name calling. Most of us figured out by fourth grade that means you have nothing valid to say. As to the first paragraph of your response, I never said get rid of fossil fuels – I said get rid of coal. As you repeatedly do on this forum, you are rebutting words that the previous commenter never said. To use the words of your idol, it’s sad, really sad. The US can easily dump coal today with a mix of natural gas, nuclear as well as renewables. Our reliance on coal has dropped to record-low levels in just a few years and all from market forces. In fact, the solar energy sector currently employs more people than coal, without endangering the public health in the process: http://fortune.com/2015/01/16/solar-jobs-report-2014/ Solar energy has tremendous potential to supply a large fraction of our energy needs, but, of course, it needs to be part of a broad-based strategy that provides full-time demand and a diversified supply structure. My solar system draws from the grid at night (when natural gas and nuclear provide power), but during the day, I supply the grid with excess production. botvinnik✓ᵀᴿᵁᴹᴾ Friday, August 26, 2016 - 11:05 am · Reply JimBob, here’s what I want you to do…go to your breaker box in your house, turn off everything for a week. If you don’t kill yourself first, come back and share your third-world experience. JimBob Friday, August 26, 2016 - 11:25 am · Reply Once again, unable to rebut an argument. In my state, ZERO percent of electricity is produced from coal. ZERO. Explain why I should turn off my breaker box? I really don’t understand what you’re saying here. It’s sad, really, just sad. botvinnik✓ᵀᴿᵁᴹᴾ Friday, August 26, 2016 - 11:26 am · Reply That IS the argument, you bonehead. jimBob Friday, August 26, 2016 - 11:33 am · Reply What is the argument? You seem unable to articulate one here. Again, you told me to turn off my breaker box because I oppose coal, which does not supply ANY electricity to me. Please, spell out for all of us what your proposed experiment would accomplish? More name calling, that’s just sad. Really sad. botvinnik✓ᵀᴿᵁᴹᴾ Friday, August 26, 2016 - 11:34 am · Reply so name your state that ZERO percent of electricity is produced by coal.. botvinnik✓ᵀᴿᵁᴹᴾ Friday, August 26, 2016 - 11:29 am · Reply There is no state in the US that ZERO percent of electricity is produced by coal…you’re fulla crap.

One mine. It’s going to take time to break this addiction. JimBob Friday, August 26, 2016 - 11:22 am · Reply Yes it will take time, but solar alone is already producing energy equivalent to dozens of conventional power plants. There are now at least six states with more than 1 GW of installed solar capacity. While most people think of Arizona, California and other sunny states as prime locations, even states like New Jersey have gotten in on this action – NJ has over 1.7 GW of capacity (approximately equal to 3-4 conventional plants and enough to supply well over 250,000 homes) and will double that within five years. That’s twice the install rate over the previous five year period. NJ currently is targeting to meet 24.5% of their electric energy needs with renewables by 2020 and many other states have similarly ambitious goals: http://www.ncsl.org/research/energy/renewable-portfolio-standards.aspx See also http://www.seia.org/research-resources/top-10-solar-states Obviously, renewables are not the only answer, but they can easily put coal to bed.

With time and priper cleanup West Virginia could become a very attractive place for recreation, second homes and such. Colorado was once dependent upon mining but has transitioned away from it. Renewables are now as inexpensive as fossil fuels without subsidy. That said, the bigger challenge will be energy efficiency as the smount of natural resources needed and build rate for solar and wind with storage show it mistly a pipe dream.

A long time ago, companies that were making most of their money in the US were being taxed US rates plus whatever the other country was charging. Those companies lobbied to have the laws changed so they were only taxed on that money IF they brought it back to the US. Shortsighted, yes, but the law we have now is the one US companies wanted. They didn’t foresee a time when they’d make THAT much more over operating costs overseas. I actually wonder why congress in it’s current state wouldn’t be able to pass another bill, like the Jobs creation bill in 2004 to lower the repatriation rate below the 5.25% it is now?

Hence, consumers can expect their new devices from the Cupertino giant to come with Intel chips starting 2018. According to Nikkei Asian Reveiw, Intel's recent pledge to expand its chip-making business is actually a move that the company is doing to secure that Apple would ask it for chip supplies and hopefully ditch Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), though the latter is set to provide the Cupertino giant with processor chips for its 2016-2017 lineup of iOS devices.  As part of this move, Intel, which is the world’s largest chipmaker by revenue, has revealed that it will be licensing technology from ARM to widen its reach among smartphone companies. Intel has apparently been struggling in the mobile industry, while ARM is monopolizing smartphone chip technology, so this deal is necessary in order for Intel to realize its plan.  For TSMC’s part, it has become the largest contract chipmaker because of its close partnership with ARM over the past decade. However, TSMC is based in Taiwan, while Intel is based in the U.S., and given that Apple has been yearning to order key components of its devices from a U.S.-based firm, Intel’s move could really make Apple reconisder its partnership with TSMC.  Related Stories Apple's 2017 iPhone Will Not Feature A Home Button, New Report Says "TSMC could face tough competition as soon as 2018 or 2019 as Intel is likely to gain orders from Apple by then. Intel has begun to engage with Apple and it aims to grab one or two top-tier customers from TSMC,” veteran semiconductor analyst at research company Gartner Samuel Wang said.  MacRumors reports that Intel could be Apple’s supplier of a portion of the tentatively named A12 chips for the Cupertino giant’s iPhones in 2018, since TSMC has already been confirmed to be the supplier of A10 and A11 chips for this year’s iPhone 7 models and next year’s 10th anniversary iPhone, respectively. "Intel is definitely the most formidable challenger for TSMC. There is no rivalry between Apple and Intel so it's really likely that Apple could shift some orders there. The move is also in line with Washington's policy to encourage U.S. companies to make more products at home,” a senior Taiwanese chip industry executive told Nikkei.  With Intel’s decision to partner with ARM, Apple will soon have another CPU supplier option aside from TSMC and Samsung. It can be noted that Apple exclusively partnered with Samsung for its processors a few years back before dividing that responsibility to TSMC and the South Korean brand for the A9 processor of its iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus and iPhone SE handsets, Apple Insider has learned.    Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

It may also unveil an updated Apple Watch among other products. Here’s a look at what we may see from this year’s iPhone — likely to be called the iPhone 7 — based on the latest rumors and reports. September launch Apple typically releases its new iPhones in September, and it seems like this year will be no different. The Cupertino, Calif.-based company is holding an invitation-only event on Sept. 7 at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco, which is where it debuted the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus last year. Bloomberg previously reported that Apple will unveil its new iPhones on that day, while VentureBeat’s Evan Blass reports that the phones will be available for purchase on Sept. 16. It’s possible that this date may be pushed back to Sept. 23, as suggested by a supposedly leaked AT&T retail schedule published by 9to5Mac. No headphone jack Apple is expected to take the controversial step of removing the headphone jack from the iPhone 7, as reports from The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg have indicated. This alteration is said to make the next iPhone slimmer and more water resistant, though critics have colored the move as consumer-unfriendly. Since Apple typically includes a pair of earbuds with each new iPhone, it’s possible we’ll see a pair of headphones that plug into the phone’s Lightning port, or a wireless pair of earbuds, ship with the iPhone 7. One report suggests Apple may introduce a set of wireless earbuds called “AirPods” sold as a separate accessory. Read more: Waiting for Apple’s next big announcements Dual camera The iPhone 7 is rumored to be getting a big boost in the photography department thanks to a new camera system. The new iPhone will feature two sensors that snap photographs simultaneously, according to Bloomberg. Each sensor is said to capture color differently, and the iPhone 7’s software will combine the results to produce a single brighter and more detailed image. While the iPhone’s camera is already among the best you can get on a smartphone, Samsung’s newer smartphones are generally better at taking photos in low-light conditions. A dual-sensor system could give Apple the upper hand. One caveat: This upgrade is only expected to appear on Apple’s larger iPhone, likely to be called the iPhone 7 Plus. That’s according to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who has made fairly accurate Apple predictions in the past. iPhone photographers who prefer the smaller model might find solace in the rumor that Optical Image Stabilization (OIS), a technology that helps reduce blur in photos, is coming to the iPhone 7. If true, it will be the first time OIS makes its way to a non-Plus model. Slightly different design Save the absence of the headphone jack, Apple’s next iPhones aren’t expected to look very different than their predecessors. However, Apple is said to have figured out a way to get rid of the antenna bands that stretch across the back of the device. Still, iPhone owners who house their devices in protective cases might not notice the difference. Next year’s flagship iPhones may see a more significant design change. Apple is rumored to be developing three new iPhones, one of which is said to have a curved screen similar to that of Samsung’s newer smartphones, according to Nikkei Asian Review. Apple is also reportedly planning to get rid of the home button as part of this redesign, Bloomberg reports. No 16GB option Apple may finally bump up the entry level iPhone’s storage capacity from 16GB to 32GB, according to The Wall Street Journal. Most Android phones come with 32GB of space by default, but Apple has maintained that 16GB is sufficient for those who use the cloud for most computing tasks. However, critics say that even with cloud storage, 16GB is hardly enough storage for many users, particularly because the iPhone’s operating system tends to take up some of that space right off the bat. “The belief is more and more as we use iCloud services for documents and our photos and videos and music, that perhaps the most price-conscious customers are able to live in an environment where they don’t need gobs of local storage because these services are lightening the load,” Phil Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of global marketing, recently told tech blogger John Gruber. Tap-to-pay for mass transit in Japan Apple is planning to incorporate a tap-to-pay technology called FeliCa into its next iPhone, according to Bloomberg. This tech will allow those in Japan to store public transportation passes on their phones rather than having to carry around physical cards. Near Field Communication, which is the technology that powers Apple Pay and other contactless payments, is popular in North America, but the FeliCa standard is very prevalent in Japan. There are 1.9 million payment terminals in Japan that support it, says Bloomberg. While the report says Apple is planning this feature for its next iPhone, Bloomberg also mentions this functionality may debut in next year’s model depending on how talks with Japan-based payment networks play out. iOS 10 Apple’s newest smartphones always come with the latest software already installed. That pattern is likely to continue. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are likely to come with iOS 10 out of the box, which brings an improved version of iMessage that supports app integration, a new Siri that can interact with third-party services, and a revamped Photos app that uses machine learning to determine the contents of an image, among other new features. Older iPhones and iPads will be able to update to iOS 10 in the fall. Read Next Your browser is out of date.

Scott Condon scondon@aspentimes.com August 26, 2016 Article Comments () Scott Condon/The Aspen Times | Bear Matthews, 15, a sophomore at Basalt High School, is part of a team of teen-agers that's launching an app in September that they say will simplify the lives of customers. Basalt High School sophomore Bear Matthews didn’t wait until classes started Wednesday to buckle down on intense homework. Matthews, 15, was recently enlisted to help promote an application created by his friend, Dylan Steck, a former classmate in New York City. The app, WebDeck, provides an online clearinghouse where customers can check their own social media notifications, calendar entries and news feeds from different devices. They can log in from any computer or mobile device. Right now, it works with Apple operating systems. It’s available at app stores but a major update for mobile versions is expected in one or two weeks, Steck said. Matthews started attending Basalt High School in December 2015 after moving to the Roaring Fork Valley. His role with WebDeck is overseeing design of the website and the physical appearance of the app, and directing social media. In addition to founder Steck, the team includes Alexander Kwok, head of design, and Charles Bailey, who is in charge of web development and software engineering. They are all between ages 14 and 17. At some point, Matthews said, the goal is to have WebDeck sync the information from devices made by different companies. It “breaks the barrier between Apple, Android and any other software notifications and makes it all accessible from anywhere,” Matthews said. In other words, customers with an Android phone and an Apple iPad will potentially be able to sync their text messages, Twitter tweets, calendar entries and news briefings at one site. That will remove frustration and open options for a lot of customers. “Once you buy a device, you’re stuck with that company, usually,” Matthews said. Steck said he is uncertain when they will develop an app for an Android device. Matthews is seasoned well beyond his years and explains WebDeck’s plan in a calm, comprehensive way. He grew up in the south of England before moving to the U.S. He got his first name, he said, after his parents abandoned the idea of calling a son “Tiger” as the name surged in popularity because of a certain pro golfer. The application is free through the App Store. When customers download and sign up, they give WebDeck permission to access their data, which it stores. Customers log on and have access to their information on one screen. “Reduce time spent searching for what you need using WebDeck and help us change the tech industry one screen at a time,” the company’s promotional material says. So why hasn’t someone else created this app? The big device manufacturers don’t have the motivation, he said. He’s uncertain why someone else didn’t create the clearinghouse. His team’s biggest problem was establishing a way to store all the data rather than creating the actual app, he said. They plan to make money from advertisements on their website and app page rather than through a fee, Matthews said. They won’t patent their app. They want to share it and have other teams improve upon their technology so customers ultimately benefit, according to Matthews. At age 15, Matthews said he can accept the fact that he might not capitalize financially on his first business venture. That’s not what’s motivating him or the team. Matthews said he’s got mixed emotions about being on a team of young entrepreneurs. On the one hand, why should there be any minimum age on inventing something, he asked. But he also acknowledged, “It does feel awkward.” Products are generally perceived as something that could be seen and felt. WebDeck’s app is something that cannot be touched. Instead, it will be judged on how it makes people feel and whether it makes their lives easier. His team is banking on an affirmative answer.

Cook sold 334,000 shares at prices ranging from $107.21 to $107.69, netting himself almost $36 million dollars. Apple also sold more than 656,000 shares on Tim Cook’s behalf, an amount over $70 million, to settle the tax liability for the RSUs that vested earlier this week as he reached his five-year anniversary as CEO of Apple. Cook on Wednesday unlocked awarded stock bonuses worth more than $100 million for both his time spent at Apple and the company’s performance under his leadership, earning 1,260,000 total shares. That number consists of 980,000 tenure-based RSUs and an allotment of 280,000 shares awarded because Apple’s shareholder return reached 61%, putting it in the top-performing third of the S&P 500 index. Tim Cook continues to hold more than 1.3 million shares of Apple stock following the sale, which is worth more than $140 million.

In Mary’s last years she requested that Aleeka be her “hands and feet” — a position of honor as an assistant to an elder. In exchange for helping hands, the elder passes down stories and cultural knowledge to the younger person. Buckskin dresses have names and stories associated with each garment, as do woven blankets. This dress was made by Diane Aiken specifically for Mary. The dress was worn by Mary when she served as grand marshal in many community celebrations over the years, including the Wenatchee Apple Blossom parade and the Omak Stampede. Mary dedicated her life to serving others while preserving Native American history and culture. She drove the seniors’ bus, managed the five community centers for the Colville Reservation, served on the Colville Business Council, interviewed and recorded tribal elders for the archival collection at the Colville History/Archaeology Department, and worked closely with linguists at the University of British Columbia to document different dialects of the Salish language using the International Phonetic Alphabet. Mary passed away in March 2013. At that time, her sons — Aleeka’s cousins — presented Aleeka with Mary’s ceremonial buckskin dress. It wasn’t until this month that the family was able to properly “bring Aleeka out” and celebrate the passing down of the dress in public on the first night of the Indian Encampment at the Omak Stampede. Photo by Joanna Bastian Aleeka Smith at the 2016 Indian Encampment at the Omak Stampede, wearing her great-auntie Mary’s ceremonial white buckskin dress. Before the ceremony, I sat with Aleeka as her cousin Olivia expertly wove Aleeka’s dark thick hair into two long braids. At 13 years old, Aleeka possesses a gentle spirit with a strong sense of who she is, and the generations that came before her — in part because of her time spent as the “hands and feet” of her Auntie Mary. She spoke quietly of her Auntie Mary, pausing as she thought before she spoke. “She was passionate about teaching everyone about our culture, and our elders, to always take care of them. I want to continue her work, passing down her stories, how she lived,” Aleeka said. Mary gave Aleeka her Indian name, StiɁícxən, which means “killdeer”, because Aleeka reminded her of the small bird that ran in short bursts along the river’s edge, flitting back and forth as she helped her Auntie. As Aleeka stepped out that night in Mary’s dress, her braids were wrapped in otter fur, and a beaded barrette secured hawk feathers to the crown of her head. Colorful beadwork covered the white buckskin dress. Sky-blue beads banded across the shoulders with white sunbursts outlined in yellow, orange, red and black beads. Purple shells cascaded in rows from the waist. Around her neck, Aleeka wore several necklaces, one of polished onyx, another of mother of pearl, and a long strand of beads and bone that matched the colors in her dress. Randy Lewis, Mary’s son, began the ceremony by speaking about his mother Mary, her impact on those around her in this world, and the importance of the dress that now belonged to Aleeka. After Randy spoke honorable words about Mary, and introduced Aleeka, a drumming group began to play, as Aleeka and her mother Crystal walked the circumference of the arena. As they passed by each of the four entryways of the arena, friends and family streamed out to join them. After embracing and sharing words of support, people joined a great line and walked in time to the drums. Some grandmothers and aunties danced in time to the beat as the crowd made their way around the arena. Just a young woman, Aleeka has many years to add to the memories associated with her Auntie Mary’s dress.

But Gwyneth Paltrow is sharing the credit for her product ideas with her make-up savvy 12-year-old daughter, Apple Martin.  'Apple was very concerned about us not having contouring kits, so we made them,' the 43-year-old mother-of-two said at a recent event, according to the New York Post. Scroll down for video  Beauty advice: Gwyneth Paltrow recently said her 12-year-old daughter, Apple Martin, helps her stay make-up savvy, according to the New York Post. The Juice Beauty cosmetic creative director attended an event for the brand in Toronto in July The middle schooler, who is apparently on top of the latest make-up trends, offers her famous mother product recommendations for the non-toxic line. 'The latest thing that she’s asked me is, "Can we please make a lip kit that stays on all day long?"' To which the Iron Man star jokingly replied, 'Good luck with that.'

Share this article Share But even Juice Beauty founder, Karen Behnke, has welcomed Apple's suggestions. And while the tween may not be receiving a pay check for her ideas, she did get a lip gloss named in her honor. 'Apple was concerned': Gwyneth said it was her tween daughter's suggestion to create 'contouring kits' for the organic beauty brand. She shared this mother-daughter photo on Instagram back in February The 'Phyto-Pigments Liquid Lip' color dubbed 'Apple' is surprisingly not red, but a vibrant shade of hot pink.  Gwyneth also talked about how proud she is of the paraben-free products. 'In California there’s a really strict standard for organic, so that’s a label you can believe. Natural doesn’t mean anything. You can discount that word completely. 'It has to be better or as good as any of those brands we all grew up using. Otherwise there’s no point,' Gwyneth added.  ‘Natural’ doesn’t mean anything': 'In California there’s a really strict standard for organic, so that’s a label you can believe,' she said This year the blonde beauty released her new cookbook, It's All Easy, which is a New York Times Best Seller.  The actress will star opposite Antonio Banderas in 33 días, due for release next year, and is also attached to the TV movie One Hit Wonders. Gwyneth has also recently announced she will be co-hosting Apple's first TV show alongside Will.i.am. Planet Of The Apps will be an Apprentice-esque competition program in which each contestant devises an app and vies for a $10 million investment in the idea.  Read more: Gwyneth gets beauty advice from her 12-year-old daughter | New York Post Share or comment on this article e-mail 137 shares Most watched News videos Mariah botches New Year's Eve performance and storms off stage Heart-warming moment woman plays piano and sings in cathedral Man goes crazy when he catches another guy in bed with his wife Woman takes seven minutes to parallel park car in double space Man finally talks to wife after over twenty years of silence Passenger insults flight attendant before being led away by police Disturbing moment pitbull kills small dog in front of its owner Mass brawl erupts between customers and restaurant staff Dog shows off its incredibly efficient banana-eating technique Bottles and furniture thrown during terrifying NYE fight Spooky!

SiliconValley.com Twitter Facebook Google+ RSS   Social Web Mobile Cloud Gadgets Cleantech VC Data Games Policy Media   Biz Break: When Barbra Streisand needed IT help, Steve Jobs answered By Rex Crum / August 26, 2016 at 3:22 PM Top Of The Order:   Steve On Speed Dial: Picture this. You just bought a new laptop, say a Macbook Air. And you have all this data, information, photos and who knows what else on your old Macbook that dates from President Obama’s first term in office. You set things up like you’re told to in order to get all that stuff off the old box and into the shiny new one. And you start waiting. And 36 hours later, you’re still waiting. In fact, for at least 12 hours, the screens have said there’s “less than a minute” left in transferring everything over. Maybe this is what happens when you use your home Wi-Fi network and data goes across at only 2 megabytes a second. Anyway, what you do is you call Apple tech support, they transfer you to a friendly tech support person who is definitely not in the United States (and you know this because, when she asks when you would like a return call, she asks what time zone in America you are in) who suggests trying an Ethernet-to-Thunderbolt connection that will help speed up the data-transfer process. You do all of this, and then, a mere 40 hours after the whole process started, you are done. This is what happens when you need tech support for you and I. This is not what happens, however, when you are Barbra Streisand. Already, we all know about Babs calling Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook to complain about how Siri pronounced her last name. (A little too much “Z” in “StreiZand,” apparently.) So, when Streisand has a problem with something, she goes right to the top. Like she did when she had some sort of tech problem a few years ago and she got Steve Jobs on the case. Uh…Who? Yes. Steve Jobs. Why not? The guy started Apple in his parents’ garage 40 years ago, so he must have known something about how to fix a Mac in the following years. According the British news site The Guardian, Streisand had some issue with one of her computers and, needing some help, got Jobs on the phone to try to sort it out. As reported by The Guardian: “The US singer told Good Morning Britain: “I couldn’t figure out something on my computer and nobody could figure it out, no IT guy, so I said; ‘Can you get Steve Jobs on the phone?’” Now, this begs the question, who did she ask about getting a hold of Jobs? One of her minions? Husband James Brolin? God, Himself? Whoever it was, they put Jobs on the phone, and can you imagine the disappointment/rage that Streisand felt when not only Jobs couldn’t figure it out, but, according to the singer, neither could his IT guy? I guess Tim Cook has better tech connections. Streisand said Cook got on the case and the ego-shattering and gratuitous pronunciation flaw involving her name is supposed to be corrected with the next iOS software update, set for Sept. 30. Middle Innings:  Autodesk Is Automatic: Let’s give a tip of the hat today to San Rafael-based Autodesk. On a day when much of the stock market, and tech sector, suffered in the wake of Fed Chairman Janet Yellen’s comments about the economy, Autodesk flexed its muscles. Autodesk, which makes design-automation software, saw its shares climb by more than 8 percent Friday to end the week at $68.87. The impetus for the gains was Autodesk reporting a surprise second-quarter profit, excluding one-time items, of 5 cents a share on revenue of $551 million. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters had forecast Autodesk to lose 13 cents a share, with sales of $512 million for the quarter that ended in July. The company said it added 109,000 subscriptions during the quarter, to give it 2.82 million. Autodesk also got in investors’ good graces Friday after it forecast a third-quarter loss of 22 cents to 27 cents share, on revenue of $470 million to $485 million. That was better than the 28-cents-a-share loss and $468.5 million sales forecast that Wall Street analysts had expected. Bottom Of The Lineup: Here’s a look at how some leading Silicon Valley stocks did Friday… Movin’ On Up: Gains came from Sigma Designs, Silver Spring Networks, Advanced Micro Devices, Glu Mobile and Zynga. In The Red: Decliners included Brocade Communications Systems, Splunk, Workday, FireEye and Nimble Storage. The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite Index edged up by 0.1 percent to 5,218. The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 0.3 percent to close at 18,395. And the broad-based Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gave up 0.2 percent to finish at 2,169.

Image: Getty Images Bloomberg cites "people familiar with Spotify's strategy" as saying that if an artist releases an album exclusively on Apple Music — as Frank Ocean just did — they can expect that their tracks won't be featured on Spotify playlists once they do hit the service. Releasing exclusively on Tidal can incur Spotify's wrath too. If true, the strategy would affect artists including Adele, Beyoncé, Drake, Frank Ocean, Kanye West and Chance the Rapper, who have all withheld music from Spotify in favour of an exclusive release on competing streaming services. Not only will an artist's tracks not get listed on Spotify playlists, but Bloomberg says that they will be buried search rankings too: Spotify has been using such practices for about a year, one of the people said, though others said the efforts have escalated over the past few months. In a statement, a Spotify spokesperson told Gizmodo that reports that Spotify is burying artists in search are "unequivocally false". Spotify is increasingly making its feelings about exclusives public. On Thursday, Troy Carter, Spotify's global head of creative services, slammed exclusives, calling them "bad for artists, bad for consumers and bad for the whole industry" in an interview with Billboard. It's important to note that this purported strategy doesn't seem to apply universally to all artists. Drake, Spotify's most-played artist in 2015, is featured prominently on Spotify across its official playlists. Hell, Drake even has his own official Spotify playlist. This, in spite of the fact that Views had a one-week window on Apple Music. Yeesh. As the war over customers and exclusives continues to escalate, it's becoming clear that the only guaranteed losers will ultimately be music fans. We reached out to Apple Music for comment but had not heard back at time of writing. [Bloomberg] Comments pepee63 @pepee63 Aug 27, 2016, 10:03am Why the hell would you want your music to be an Apple exclusive. Apple only has 12 percent market share and by doing an Apple exclusive, you're denying yourself a huge market and hence a lot less sales. It's a stupid move. Reply 0 James @jamesh Aug 27, 2016, 1:39pm (a) they all seem to be timed exclusives, so they'll get the exposure on other platforms eventually, and (b) exclusive contracts are almost always accompanied by payments for the exclusivity. If the artists are signing exclusivity deals, it is almost certainly in their financial interest. If this report is accurate, this is Spotify trying to change the dynamics of these kind of deals. Reply 0 not an idiot Guest Aug 27, 2016, 1:54pm almost certainly because apple is paying them a buttload of cash up front in order to get the exclusive. Reply 0 Join the discussion!

I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments Contents New tvOS 10 update release date & new features New TV app for iPad, iPhone and Apple TV Macworld podcast - Apple's 27 Oct launch event Which Apple TV models can run tvOS 10? How to update your Apple TV to tvOS 10 What's new in tvOS 10? Podcast - WWDC report WWDC 2016 wrapup show New features wishlist Just as iOS and macOS receive regular free updates, patching bugs, tweaking the interface and unlocking new features, tvOS has just had its first major update: tvOS 10. tvOS is the operating system software platform that runs on the fourth-gen Apple TV. It's the Apple TV's equivalent of iOS on the iPhone or macOS on the Mac; it manages the apps you can install on the device and offers various features of its own. Read on for tvOS 10 features, and how to get tvOS 10 now. Updated, 27 October, with details of Apple's new TV app for iPad, iPhone and Apple TV Read next: iOS 10 review | macOS Sierra preview | watchOS 3 new features New tvOS 10 update release date & new features tvOS 10 was released on 13 September alongside iOS 10 and watchOS 3, after releasing the tvOS golden master on 7 September after the iPhone 7 event. That means, if you have a compatible Apple TV (more on that below) you can update to tvOS 10 now. tvOS 9.0 was announced alongside the fourth-gen Apple TV in September 2015, and came pre-loaded on that device when it went on sale the following month. We've seen a number of what we call 'point' upgrades - tvOS 9.2 is the newest at time of writing - but the convention with operating systems is that major features are saved for full-number updates. (Mind you, a couple of features in iOS 9.3 pushed that principle to its limits, and some believe that Apple is heading towards a system where it release features steadily throughout the year.) New tvOS 10 update: New TV app for iPad, iPhone and Apple TV At its 27 October new MacBook Pro launch event tonight, Apple also announced a new app for the Apple TV. It's just called 'TV'. In fact, TV is an app for the iPad and iPhone too, and thus a potentially valuable unifying tool for syncing the content you play on multiple devices: watch part of a TV show on your iPad, say, and then open it on the Apple TV and it should pick up at the exact point where you left off. It's designed to provide what Apple calls "a unified experience for discovering and accessing TV shows and movies from multiple apps on Apple TV, iPhone and iPad". TV is a bit like an electronic programme guide, and the place from which most activities naturally begin: the presenter said it was the first app she opened up each time she switched on the Apple TV, and a member of the Macworld team immediately reacted by wondering why the features of the TV app isn't just baked into the Apple TV's natural interface. You can access TV shows and movies from the TV app, but Apple is also trying to use the TV app to replicate the discovery elements from Apple Music. Content continues below Here are the main features of the TV app: Watch Now: Your basic content library. This is where you'll browse your TV shows, films and on on - anything downloaded from iTunes or similar services and apps. Up Next: A smart system that automatically queues up the TV episode or whatever that you're likely to want to watch next; you can tell Siri to continue watching a programme and it will automatically find the next episode. Netflix does something similar, and it's rather handy. Recommended: The equivalent of Apple Music's For You and Browse discovery features, this section contains curated playlists and what Apple calls "trending" TV and films - we're not sure exactly what that means. There will also be content organised by genres and categories - again, something that Netflix is very good at currently. Library: This is where you view all the films and TV programmes you've rented or bought from iTunes. Store: Where you buy new stuff. "Using apps on Apple TV, iPhone and iPad has become the primary way for so many of us to watch television," said Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of Internet Software and Services. "The TV app shows you what to watch next and easily discover TV shows and movies from many apps in a single place." The TV app became available in December 2016 as part of the point upgrade tvOS 10.1  New MacBook Pro: Macworld podcast - Apple's 27 Oct launch event The UK Tech Weekly Podcast team discuss Apple's 27 October launch event, including the new TV app, in episode 38, embedded below. The UK Tech Weekly Podcast comes out every Friday. Follow the team on Twitter to get notifications of new episodes. New tvOS 10 update release date & new features: Which Apple TV models can run tvOS 10? The fourth-generation Apple TV is the only Apple TV that can currently be updated to tvOS 10.  Apple cannot extend support back to previous generations: they're simply not equipped to run apps and a full iOS-esque OS, which means that Apple TV gen 1, 2 and 3 users are out of luck. New tvOS 10 update release date & new features: How to update your Apple TV to tvOS 10 tvOS 10 is a free update that, as we explained above, will work with all fourth-gen Apple TV models. Updating your Apple TV to tvOS 10 is easy. Head to the Settings app, then select System and go to the Maintenance submenu. Click 'Software updates', then 'Update Software'. Once the installation file has been downloaded, you'll see an update prompt; select the option 'Download and Install'. When the update is finished, the Apple TV will restart. If you'd like to read about the process in more depth, take a look at How to update Apple TV software. Read next: 14 best Apple TV alternatives | Best TV streaming devices New tvOS 10 update release date & new features: What's new in tvOS 10? As we've already mentioned, tvOS got a fair bit of love at WWDC 2016 on 13 June during Apple's keynote for press and developers (some would say a little too much love, given the number of important upgrades in iOS 10 and macOS Sierra that Apple didn't have time to mention). Introducing the new operating system for the Apple TV, Eddy Cue revealed that developers have created 6,000 native apps in the seven months since the Apple TV got an App Store. But what's new from Apple? Here are the new features available for your (fourth-gen) Apple TV. Siri Siri has some big improvements in the new update. It can now search your Apple TV's movie and TV database with more complex and more natural-language-based queries. The example Apple gave was "high-school comedies from the 80s" - although it should be pointed out that this didn't work perfectly in the demo. Siri can also search YouTube, too, and any live streaming channels can be launched by saying "watch" and then whatever the channel is. ESPN, for example. And it can be used to control HomeKit-compatible smart-home appliances, with phrases such as "set thermostat to 72". Read next: How to fix the most common Siri problems Dark Mode Dark Mode for Apple TV went down rather well. You can activate it to turn the background black instead of the bright white we're used to. Good for those situations when you're settling down with your popcorn to watch a movie in a dark room. If you're wondering about the Dark Mode we were expecting in iOS 10, fear not: we're fairly sure that's on its way soon. Remote app Another bit of big news is the redesigned Apple TV remote app, which brings all of the Siri remote features to the app. It can be used for Siri queries using the built-in mic, but you can also input text thanks to the keyboard. That's not all either, as Apple also claimed that the Remote app would use the iPhone's built-in sensors to be used as a gamepad, allowing users to play two-player games without having to fork out for another Siri remote.  Read next: New Apple TV Remote iPhone app review Single Sign-on Single Sign-on lets you sign in once to authenticate all apps, and any Apple TV-compatible app you download on iOS will automatically show up on your Apple TV. This feature is more useful than it looks, as it allows a quick access to your apps, without having to download them on your Apple TV. We see this as one of the major steps forward in the newer revision of tvOS. Photos Like iOS 10 and macOS Sierra, tvOS brings the new features of Photos to the Apple TV. The most appealing of these is Memories. Memories is designed to build digital albums for you automatically. It will recognise faces and places, and combine this data with the time and location where images and videos were taken to combine them intelligently into themed groupings - even selecting the best bits of video clips to use. Apple promises that these albums will be easily customisable (you can pick a different preset 'tone', for instance, and the accompanying music will change) and they looked decent in the (obviously pre-prepared) demo version, but we'll need to test its performance in everyday use. Apple Music Like Photos, Apple Music has had a revamp, and this affects the Apple TV just as it does the iPhone, iPad and Mac. This means you can enjoy the cleaner, simpler new look of Apple Music in tvOS. (And presumably the new onscreen lyrics feature? Logically that ought to be part of the package, but Apple hasn't specifically told us that tvOS will get this feature.) Automatic app downloads This is a small thing, but if you download a Universal app to your iPhone it will automatically be installed on your Apple TV. We assume this feature will be optional. Games controllers One thing Apple didn't mention, but has since come to light in Apple support documents, is that the requirement for Siri Remote compatibility for Apple TV games has been removed. That means they can focus on MFi game controllers, which are much more game-friendly than the Siri remote and provide a more comfortable and enjoyable gaming experience on the Apple TV. Read more: Best Apple TV game controllers New features in beta 3 and beta 4 of tvOS 10 On 15 August 2016 Apple released beta 6 of tvOS 10 to developers who've joined the beta testing programme - at time of writing that's the most up-to-date version of tvOS that anyone outside Apple has tried. The six betas released thus far have added a range of tweaks, bug fixes and (usually minor) new features, but the closer we get to final launch day, the more Apple shifts to bug fixing: significant changes to the feature set would be a surprise at this point. Beta 6, for instance, doesn't add any new features - like most late-stage betas it focuses on fixing bugs. There are some known issues related to the way keyboards are presented in light and dark graphical modes: "An already presented system keyboard now correctly responds to system appearance changes between light and dark," Apple says, while an issue that causes the appearance of dark text on a dark background in search keyboards is identified but is still to be addressed. For more information, check Apple's release notes for tvOS 10 beta 6. Beta 5 was similarly focused on bug fixes. One issue had sometimes caused artwork for recently added tracks not to appear in the Music app, but this has been addressed. For more information check Apple's release notes for tvOS 10 beta 5. Beta 4: tvOS 10 Beta 4 adds a number of mostly relatively small fixes. The most important changes in this update concern Live Photos ("Live Photos now function," as Apple’s release notes laconically note), while Podcasts gets closed captioning and a common complaint with game controllers has been addressed: "After pairing a Game Controller, an 'App Not Installed' dialog no longer appears." Beta 3: Beta 3 saw some significant changes to Music. Our favourite may be that Siri can now be used to like or dislike a track ("Like this song" appears to be the preferred phrasing). But you can also add songs played on Beats 1 to existing playlists, and there are two significant fixes: "Song playback now functions when accessing songs from Go to Album" and "Go to Artist pages now load". Beta 3 also included a few linguistic updates. Norwegian, Dutch and Swedish are now all supported for sport queries through Siri.

With the Cupertino-based tech giant expected to unveil several new devices, such as the new iPhone 7 and Apple Watch, as well as the newest version of tvOS and iOS 10, the event is sure to be an important and exciting one. In the days leading up to the event, a select few are now able to test the newest beta of Apple’s mobile operating software, iOS 10. Image Credit: Apple Inc. Final beta of upcoming iOS 10 Apple today seeded the eighth beta of iOS 10 to developers and public beta testers for testing purposes, one week after the company released the seventh beta, and more than two months after the first unveiling of the new operating system at its 2016 Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). The iOS 10 beta is now available as an over-the-air download for those of us who’ve installed the first seven betas or the beta configuration profile. For developers, it’s available as a direct download via Apple’s Developer Center. iOS biggest update Apple has ever released The highly-anticipated and hyped iOS 10 is a major iOS update which will certainly feature a ton of new, as well as improved, features, in addition to design tweaks. The update will include a new Lock screen experience with 3D Touch-enabled notifications, a more easily accessible camera, a redesigned Control Center, and a brand-new widgets screen. According to Apple, the upcoming iOS 10 is the company’s biggest iOS update they’ve ever released. The Messages application within iOS 10 has undergone a complete overhaul, including new features like background animations, Digital Touch, bubble effects, Tapback replies, predictive emojis, and handwritten notes. The new Photos application has new facial and object recognition features as well as a Memories feature for rediscovering forgotten photos. While the iOS 10 beta is currently only available to developers and public testers, the upgraded mobile operating system will most likely see a full public release this September, most likely alongside the release of the iPhone 7. iOS 10 beta 8 is most likely the final beta update before the master version is officially launched, as Apple will need a bit of time to work out the final software.

Apple has now threatened legal action against Digital Music News for reporting on multiple leaks of Frank Ocean’s latest album, ‘Blonde’.  ‘Blonde,’ alternatively spelled ‘Blond,’ is one of two Ocean albums released in rapid succession last week, with both quickly leaked across dozens of different file-hosting, file-sharing, torrent, and streaming platforms within 24 hours.   That includes high-profile and embarrassing leaks on both Google Drive and SoundCloud, both of whom offered one or both of Frank Ocean’s albums for free, for multiple days after the release.  Digital Music News reported on both of these breaches, specifically involving ‘Blond,’ and Apple quickly retaliated by alleging that Digital Music News was facilitating copyright piracy by drawing attention to the leaks. The articles were more specifically focused on the issues associated with streaming exclusives, including calamitous leaks that can result.  But the article also raised difficult questions over why both Google and SoundCloud were getting away with offering the illegal copies over a multi-day period, and openly flouting Apple’s exclusive in the process. In a demand letter sent by Apple agent Douglas Kassem of anti-infringement group GrayZone, Inc., two articles discussing ‘Blonde’ leaks on Google Drive and SoundCloud were cited as containing ‘UNAUTHORIZED MATERIAL IN CONNECTION WITH FRANK OCEAN,’ with a demand to delete both articles or suffer unspecific damages or legal action. Apparently, the first attempt to reach us was unsuccessful, but that could be due to the use of ‘ALL CAPS’ in the title, which can quickly relegate messages to spam folders.  The first warning may have also been sent to a nonexistent email box at Digital Music News, based on the addresses listed on the second note received (which included a combination of unknown and real addresses). We’re unaware of any phone calls or mailed correspondence from either GrayZone or Apple. Sloppily, the GrayZone email that eventually reached us was titled, ‘URGENT – [SECOND] NOTICE OF INFRINGEMENT AND DECLARATION: APPLE MUSIC | Frank Ocean [digitalmusicnews.com],’ but didn’t even specify why the articles themselves were deemed to be infringing.  Guessing, we offered to immediately remove the links to the folders and SoundCloud pages, even though Google and SoundCloud were hosting the material, but flatly refused to remove the articles. Both articles are still live. We then contacted Apple media representative Tom Neumyr concerning the threats, but did not hear back from either Apple proper or GrayZone.  Amazingly, Google Drive only removed the folder containing the album days after we received this threat, while SoundCloud still has multiple copies of the album available to users.  All of which raises the question: why was Apple threatening Digital Music News, when the actual companies hosting the album — Google and SoundCloud — had yet to comply (and still haven’t complied)? That may be answered by who actually owns the rights to ‘Blonde’: Frank Ocean.  Indeed, without a demand from the actual rights owner, in this case the artist (who released the album freshly out of his UMG contract), Google, SoundCloud, or anyone else doesn’t have to honor a DMCA takedown notice.  Why Google ultimately removed the offending, publicly-available folder on Drive is anyone’s guess, though the delay offers yet another aspect to a disastrous Apple Music launch. Tellingly, in the legal demand to Digital Music News, Apple claims to be the IP owner, which doesn’t quite sound right.  Sounds like a classic case of overreach, though that rarely holds back lawyers when it comes to C&Ds and threatening letters.  Here’s the suspicious excerpt (full letter below): APPLE MUSIC I, the undersigned, do solemnly and sincerely declare and CERTIFY UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY that: 1. I am the owner or an agent authorized to act on behalf of the owner of certain intellectual property rights, said owner being named APPLE (“IP Owner”). 2. I have a good faith belief that the materials identified above are not authorized by the above IP Owner, its agent, or the law and therefore infringe the IP Owner’s rights. Perhaps this is all an attempt by Apple to take matters into its own hands.  It now appears that Universal Music Group and Frank Ocean purposely refrained from curbing infringement of their own albums, even though Apple Music was rumored to have paid millions for exclusive rights to release both.  But without the cooperation of rights owners, Apple’s efforts were completely diluted, while both UMG and Ocean gained heavy upside by exposing the album to the widest audience possible. Days later, UMG chief Lucian Grainge declared an end to all digital exclusives, according to information leaked by Bob Lefsetz, a major slap against Apple’s streaming strategy.

However, providing actual links to the content is a bad idea, and that’s likely why Apple sent the notice. There’s certainly an argument that can be made as to whether or not providing instructions on how to pirate certain content (which is essentially what a link is) instead of providing the content itself should be considered infringement or free speech. But it’s probably better that you let Google try to make that argument. Reply Anonymous August 26, 2016 “I think it’s certainly appropriate and newsworthy to report that the leaks happened.

Reply Paul Resnikoff August 26, 2016 I see that perspective, but, the articles are about the leaks and the issues that those leaks present, not some torrent link farm. It’s a really interesting legal question, because it would be the same as a New York Times article about a heroine spot with specifics (all housed in a legitimate office building!) Reply Anonymous August 26, 2016 “it would be the same as a New York Times article about a heroine spot with specifics (all housed in a legitimate office building!)” Naming the office owner is good journalism — telling junkies where to go is not. Reply Anonymous August 26, 2016 I think this is essentially what SOPA boiled down to. It’s definitely a good topic for discussion. Reply Someone Who Actually Understands August 29, 2016 [i]”I see that perspective, but, the articles are about the leaks and the issues that those leaks present, not some torrent link farm.”[/i] Um,… you DO realize that this is the EXACT SAME argument that Google has for not (completely) filtering search results for users who use whatever terms they may. Right? Google doesn’t editorialize (much…) the results it renders from searches, because a) they aren’t driving users to “torrent link farms” and b) filtering search results is a form of prior restraint of free expression. What’s good for the goose? Also, heroin is a drug, a [i]heroine[/i] is a female hero. Reply Billy D August 26, 2016 ,i.”I see that perspective, but, the articles are about the leaks and the issues that those leaks present, not some torrent link farm.” LOL You’re now whipping up Apple’s takedown request into some sort of unwarranted evil First Amendment jihad against DMN. Clearly Apple’s main intent here was to have DMN remove/obfuscate the direct links to infringing content. Mission accomplished. +1 Apple Posting the links was negligent, irresponsible, unnecessary & reckless. DMN…you were wise to abide. Reply Versus August 26, 2016 It was irresponsible of DMN to direct people to the specific piracy sites, and even post direct links. Apple is in the right here. Reply Anon August 26, 2016 Paul is an a**hole and an idiot. Posting direct links to piracy sites, and saying that all you’re doing is reporting the news. Of course they’re going to come after you. Reply Anonymous August 27, 2016 OK, I think he got the memo now. 🙂 And you could actually say his freaky reaction to a boilerplate takedown is sort of charming. Compare to Pirate Bay and Google who brag about the millions of notes they get. Paul f*cked up — but he actually believes in law and order. Imagine if you could say that about Google. Reply Anonymous August 27, 2016 …also, you can’t help smiling when he actually posts stuff like this: “This email message, and any attachments thereto, is for the sole use of the intended recipients and may contain legally privileged and/or confidential information. Any unauthorized review, use, disclosure or distribution is strictly prohibited“ Especially, when that stuff comes from something called ‘GrayZone, Inc.’ 🙂 Reply Martin August 27, 2016 Very silly on so many different levels! Reply Nicky Knight's thoughts August 28, 2016 The report highlighted the rampant disregard over copyright by blatantly having the album up for free on those sites/platforms. Apple, artists, producers, songwriters and anyone else who owns the copyright in music sound recordings should protect their creative assets otherwise the public will snatch it all up for free and you’re left with a begging bowl on Sunset Blvd. Reply Musicservices4less August 29, 2016 Remember promo copies? That worked great back in the day because you could actually limit the number of “free” copies available. Not so in with the internet. All it basically does is devalue not only the specific songs involved but in general gives the impression to the consumer that the mass appeal artists can be gotten for free so what does that say about less appealing artists? Very bad promotional/marketing maneuver for established artists. Reply Anonymous August 29, 2016 The other premise, that the roll out was “disasterous” and “embarrassing” is also amusing, considering Blonde will be the #1 album in the country this week. Many labels would pay dearly for that kind of “disaster”. Reply John Matarazzo August 29, 2016 Grayzone: A mail drop and a phone line. What an operation!

Frank Ocean released albums Endless and Blonde last week, but people aren’t waiting until it’s available elsewhere to legally listen to something that’s been promised for years. Both Endless and Blonde landed as Apple Music exclusives, so anyone who wants to legally listen to those albums needs an Apple Music subscription (which costs $9.99 per month for an individual account) or they can purchase it on iTunes. But that exclusivity window is leading those who don’t like Apple Music, pay for another streaming music service like Spotify or Tidal, and people who just don’t want to pay for music, to torrent those albums in large numbers. According to MUSO, a “privacy audience reconnection” data analytics specialist, people illegally downloaded Blonde more than 750,000 times in its first six days. In comparison, Kanye West’s The Life of Pablo, a Tidal exclusive, was illegally downloaded more than 500,000 times in its first day—but West didn’t release two comprehensive albums within days of each other. MUSO’s numbers don’t include the number of downloads for individual songs like “Nikes” or illegal streaming numbers, so the total number of illegal downloads are likely even bigger than what’s being reported. Despite the piracy of Blonde, it’s projected to debut at the top of the Billboard 200 chart with around 225,000 to 250,000 album units, which includes album sales and stream equivalent numbers for albums and tracks.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) is about to introduce a new feature in iPhones in Japan which would let users pay for their public transport using their smartphones rather than payments cards. People privy to the matter have told the publication that the iPhone maker would include a chip called “FeliCa” made by Sony Corp. (ADR) (NYSE:SNE) in future iPhone models in Japan. In theory, users would be able to store virtual transit passes in the Wallet app on their iPhones, according to the anonymous source. The FeliCa chip would let them save their train as well as bus passes on their phones, and tap the phone instead of a physical payment card against scanners at entrances. However, it should be remembered that Japan does have few dominant transit payment card providers, depending on the location and type of transport in question, such as  Pasmo and Suica. Transit service providers acquire access from card companies as and when needed, or monthly. Given that Japan alone comprised 8% of Apple’s third-quarter revenues, and 11% of its operating margin, it makes sense for the company to try to avail this opportunity. On the other hand, Apple Pay, the company’s dominant payments service powered by Near Field Communication (NFC) technology, has been predominant in Australia, Europe, and North America, while FeliCa has been prevalent in Japan owing to its penetration through 1.9 million payment terminals which handled $46 billion worth of transactions last year. Data from UK Cards Association and Let’s Talk Payments suggests that the US had a total of 1.3 million NFC terminals last year, while the UK had 320,000. Every year on September 9, Apple showcases its new iPhone model at an annual event. Given that this year’s event is only a few days away now, readers must be wondering whether this FeliCa chip would arrive in the upcoming model. The sources which leaked this information also said that Apple would launch this feature in the coming version, however, if discussions with payments networks in Japan disintegrated it might hold this feature for subsequent models. Next year, at its 10-year anniversary, Apple Inc. plans to massively redesign the iPhone once again. Sources familiar with the matter said that the company would remove the Home button in a bid to improve focus on the display. Sony’s FeliCa chip can process a transaction in 0.1 seconds, which is exactly the kind of technology Apple needs to stay relevant in Japan’s fast-pace environment. Right now, transactions via Apple Pay are going through a server and need a bank approval to pass, which is slowing the process down. The people who disclosed the matter further said that the FeliCa chip would also make it easier for iPhone users to store e-money, which is now being accepted at cafes, convenience stores, and vending machines across the country. They also said that Apple is in talks with a financial firm to support such transactions in Japan. Since its launch in October 2014, Apple Pay has gone to the UK, Switzerland, Singapore, France, Hong Kong, China, Canada, and Australia. Apple Services, which grew 19% year-on-year to $6 billion through the third quarter, gets a hefty contribution from Apple Pay. Earlier in August, Japanese telecom carrier KDDI signed a deal with Apple which would let the company’s customers get their iTunes transactions billed as part of their phone bill as opposed to being billed to their credit card. Apple previously made the same move in Taiwan, Switzerland, Russia, the UK, and Germany. In July, the iPhone maker said it would offer mass-transit navigation support for Japan in the maps app on iPhones. The feature is said to appear in iOS 10, and would also let users see arrival and departure times. Comments Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Latest Security Patch to Make Upcoming iPhone "Unhackable" Apple has released a new security patch to protect against a previously-unknown method of hacking Published By: Ken Bock on August 26, 2016 12:31 pm EST Facebook Google+ Twitter Pinterest Stumbleupon AAPL Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has released a new security patch which is about prove to be a significant step toward preventing its iPhones from being hacked in new ways. A previously-unknown method of hacking was affecting millions of iPhone devices due to a security gap found in the smartphones’ configuration settings. However, the Cupertino-based tech giant has finally resolved this precarious security flaw in its flagship device. The Country Caller discusses why Apple has been forced to revamp the security of its devices. The iPhone maker took the necessary action, after a user residing in the United Arab Emirates had warned the company that its iPhones were being targeted by hackers. The tech giant was receiving complaints from users regarding a text message they would receive which included a link to a website. Upon clicking that link, a malicious program would get installed on their device and enabling the hacker to use the program as a “digital spy” to pry in on the user’s device and retrieve their personal details. Luckily, one of these users decided to forward this malicious text to a research center which figured out the motive of the program. Once a device gets infected, the program is actually capable of accessing its camera and microphone to spy on the activity occurring in the hacked device’s vicinity. This makes the program completely capable of tracking your WhatsApp conversations, Viber Calls, messages logs, and any other application which has access to the camera or microphone! Interestingly, researchers believe that the organization held responsible for such malicious hacking is none other than Israel’s NSO Group. Also, Apple has not directly accused UAE officials on the increasing rate of iPhone hackings in recent years but the tech giant has noticed such connections to the government of the country. On the brighter side though, the tech company has taken another giant leap in its bid to completely prevent its devices from being hacked, which is just what would make the upcoming iPhone even better.

The news comes after Apple recently secured a patent titled “Biometric Capture For Unauthorized User Identification”. Apple’s anti-theft system would capture the theif’s biometric information in response to certain types of triggers. The trigger could be intrusion or unauthorized access from a third-party. Upon receiving any such trigger the iPhone could gather and store the the biometric data of the intruder, which can be a fingerprint, an image, a video, or an audio of the user’s environment at the time of gaining access into the iPhone. This system is expected to be present in future versions of not just the iPhone but the iPad as well. Apple has always taken initiatives against theft, for example ‘Find my iPhone’ and their feature that locks out users on a repetitive incorrect login codes or fingerprints. Their foray into a proper anti-theft system is a first. But let us not forget that anti-theft systems have been around for a while with several apps aiming to keep your phones safe. But if Apple can bring something better to the table, what could be the harm. Furthermore, Apple would have to remain strictly cautious of not exposing or leaking this sensitive user information to the wrong hands. And Apple would would also need to do something about making their TouchID more accurate otherwise this anti-theft system may be rendered completely useless. But for now Apple has just patented the idea and patents very often don’t even make it to the market. We’ll just have to wait and see what happens to this one. ×TechJuice for Browser: Get breaking news notifications on your browser.

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY   TRIVIA Search How-To Geek How to Set Your iPhone to Remember Where You Parked It’s no fun to end your trip wandering around looking for your car. Now, thanks to a new iOS feature, you don’t have to–let’s take a look at how to take advantage of the “Parked Car” reminder in iOS 10. What Your Need Over the years, there’s been a plethora of iOS apps that help remind you where you car is parked. Some of them are standalone single purpose apps. Others, like the popular GPS/driving software Waze, include a parking reminder tool. RELATED ARTICLE The Best New Features in iOS 10 (and How to Use Them) With the release of iOS 10, however, Apple introduced a welcome improvement: parking reminders integrated right into the Maps app built right into iOS. Now it’s easy to check where your car is without third party apps…or remembering yourself. So what do you need? First you’ll need an iOS device with a GPS chip (all iPhones and cellular-enabled iPads) running iOS 10 or above, which is available now. RELATED ARTICLE How to Add Bluetooth to Your Car Second, you’ll need a car with Apple’s CarPlay integration or some sort of integrated Bluetooth (the parking reminder uses the loss of the CarPlay connection/Bluetooth signal as a marker that the car is parked). If your car doesn’t have Bluetooth, you can always add it yourself with one of these kits. If you meet those two requirements, let’s look at ensuring the feature is on and linked to your car and then how to use it. How to Set It Up By default, the new feature should be enabled in iOS 10 without any fussing on your behalf, but that doesn’t mean everything always goes off smoothly. Ensure the Parked Car Reminder Is On It only takes a second or two to check if the setting is on, so let’s do so now. On your iOS device, open the Settings menu and scroll down until you see the entry for the “Maps” app, as seen below. Select it, then scroll down again until you see the entry for “Your Car”. If “Show Parked Location” is already on, leave it be and close the settings app. Otherwise, toggle it on. Pair Your Phone With Your Car If you haven’t already been using Bluetooth in your car for phone calls or music playback, you’ll need to take a moment to pair your phone with the car. While the setup process varies from vehicle to vehicle, the iOS side of things is always the same. You’ll need to put your car’s stereo or dashboard system into Bluetooth pairing mode, then navigate to Settings > Bluetooth on your iPhone. Ensure your Bluetooth is on, as seen below. Scroll to the bottom of the device list to see the unpaired devices in your vicinity you can pair your phone with. Pair with your vehicle’s Bluetooth connection and you’re ready to go. Remember, the system only works if your Bluetooth is on. If you toggle Bluetooth off, you won’t get the parking reminders, because your phone won’t know when your car is near. How to Use the Parked Car Reminder Once you’ve ensured the Parked Car reminder is turned on and your phone is linked to your car, the Parked Car reminder will automatically set itself every time you park and exit your vehicle. You can absolutely ignore the feature until you need it, but you may wish to interact with it proactively. First, let’s look at how you can use the Parked Car feature even if you do absolutely nothing. Any time you’re away from your vehicle, you can check your notifications–in the screenshot below you can see the parking reminder on the iOS 10 lock screen notification panel–and look for “Map Destinations”. There you’ll find an entry for “Parked Car”. You can also access the Parked Car reminder by opening the Maps app, swiping up on the address search bar to reveal previous destinations, and selecting “Parked Car”. Regardless of the way you access the menu, you’ll see results like the parking reminder below. The most obvious function, and the one the requires no prior interaction from you, is to simply tap the “Directions” button and follow the instructions to hoof it back to your car. There are, however, some handy functions here that are best accessed before you actually need to find your car. When you first park your car and get out, iOS will notice that you’re parked. You can immediately pull up the Parked Car feature and do several handy things. First, you can tap the “Edit Location” button, if you’ve noticed the GPS locating has hiccuped a bit or is otherwise inaccurate, and re-position the parking marker. If, for example, your car is buried in a giant multi-layer parking structure, it might be handy to move the marker to the actual street entrance to the parking structure so the return instructions will guide you back to the appropriate entrance. Speaking of giant parking structures, this brings us to two other handy functions: the photo and note function. Rather than open up your camera app and take a picture of the parking reminder like the sign that says “Floor 1: Aisle 28A”, you can snap a picture right in the parking reminder menu of the sign (or any other surrounding landmark that will help you find your car) or put a text note in the note slot. Now you’ll never waste time looking for your car again. Even better, with Bluetooth enabled and your phone paired to your car, you can take advantage of another cool iOS feature–introduced back in iOS 9–location based reminders that are triggered when you exit your car.

Artists who have given Apple exclusive access to new music have been told they won’t be able to get their tracks on featured playlists once the songs become available on Spotify, said the people, who declined to be identified discussing the steps. Those artists have also found their songs buried in the search rankings of Spotify, the world’s largest music-streaming service, the people said. Spotify said it doesn’t alter search rankings. Spotify has been using such practices for about a year, one of the people said, though others said the efforts have escalated over the past few months. Artists who have given exclusives to Tidal, the streaming service run by Jay Z, have also been retaliated against, the person said, declining to identify specific musicians. Biggest Challenger Apple’s music service has emerged as the largest challenger to Spotify over the past year, signing up more than 15 million subscribers since its debut last June, the company said two months ago. Exclusive deals for new music from artists such as Drake, Chance the Rapper and Frank Ocean are central to Apple’s strategy. Spotify has more than 30 million subscribers globally. Apple Music also has ways to promote artists, such as highlighting their songs in its Top Tracks section, giving it ways to play favorites with musicians. The dustup over exclusives comes at a critical time for Spotify, which is in the midst of renegotiating licensing contracts with the world’s biggest record labels. The company is aiming to hold an initial public offering by the end of next year, but needs more favorable long-term agreements with the labels to attract a higher valuation from investors, according to a person familiar with the plans. The company isn’t profitable despite generating more than $2 billion in revenue, in part because it has to give 55 percent of the money to labels and an additional cut to publishers. It’s not clear whether major artists like Drake and Ocean have been affected by Spotify’s measures, and their representatives didn’t respond to questions. In any case, artists of their stature need less help from Spotify to draw attention to their music, emerging acts rely on the service to find new listeners. The company has threatened to use its retaliatory practices on lesser-known artists who introduce music on a Beats One show hosted by DJ Zane Lowe, an architect of Apple’s radio service, the people said. One representative of a singer-songwriter said the client canceled plans to debut a song on Lowe’s show because of concern that the artist would lose promotion from Spotify. The agent asked not to be identified, and that the artist not be named, to avoid damaging relationships with the music-streaming companies. Lowe, a former BBC radio host, has introduced new tracks from his first day on the air with Beats One, and his show has become an important platform to debut songs worldwide. Ratcheting Up Apple and Spotify have been feuding since before Apple Music’s debut, and competition between the two ratcheted up again in the last several weeks after Apple proposed changing songwriting royalties in a way that would increase costs for competitors like Spotify by putting its music in a different category that requires a higher rate. Spotify has also accused Apple of blocking a new version of its iPhone app, the latest volley in an ongoing dispute over Apple’s cut of sales from its app store. Apple denied blocking Spotify’s app, saying its rival hadn’t met its terms of service. Led by former record executive Jimmy Iovine, Apple Music has kept its strategy flexible to appeal to what an artist wants. In the case of Frank Ocean and Drake, the company paid for exclusives. With Adele and Beyonce, it agreed to keep the music off its streaming service and initially only make it available for a paid download. The company also has been appealing to artists and industry executives by limiting its streaming service to paying subscribers and not having a free advertising-supported version like Spotify.

However, it has sought to make exclusive deals with some artists, such as rock band the 1975, but refused to limit the release to the company’s paid service only, as labels and musicians have sought, two of the people said. Spotify has said a robust free service is needed to attract new users who can eventually become subscribers.  Record labels are still pushing Spotify to let artists release music for paying subscribers only, and have yet to sign new long-term deals with the service as a result. Yet Apple’s ability to attract those big exclusives may also be in jeopardy. In an internal memo this week, Lucian Grainge, chief executive officer of Vivendi SA’s Universal Music Group, directed the heads of his company’s labels to stop giving any music services long-term exclusives, according to two people familiar with the matter. Universal has sold Apple many of its biggest exclusives, including Drake. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Sadly, the telematics from Google and Apple didn’t arrive for them. Blue Oval offered a vague answer to mystified Mustang drivers, saying that the upgrade would come about late this year. It’s already approaching the latter half of Q3 2016, and whether or not the upgrade to Android Auto and Apple CarPlay has come about remains a mystery. If it hasn’t, then current Mustang owners should be excited. That’s because the 2017 Mustang – standard with support for the two systems via Sync 3 – has rolled out to dealerships after going into production this past June. Those on the current year model of the Blue Oval stallion should expect the upgrade to be available soon. This is also sweet news for those intending to get their hands on the 2017 Ford F-150 or its high-performance Raptor variant. The full-size pickup, despite being far ahead of its peers in sales success, typically lags behind closest rival Chevrolet Silverado in terms of in-cabin tech. The integration of Android Auto and Apple CarPlay may not put it neck-to-neck with its Detroit rival in that aspect just yet, but brings the F-150 one step closer.

SAN FRANCISCO: Apple iPhone owners on Friday were urged to install a quickly released security update after a sophisticated attack on an Emirati dissident exposed vulnerabilities targeted by cyber arms dealers. Researchers at Lookout mobile security firm and Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto said they uncovered a fierce, three-pronged cyber attack targeting a dissident's iPhone "that subverts even Apple's strong security environment." Lookout and Citizen Lab worked with Apple on an iOS patch to defend against what was called "Trident" because of its triad of attack methods, the researchers said in a joint blog post. "We were made aware of this vulnerability and immediately fixed it with iOS 9.3.5," Apple said in a released statement. Trident is used in spyware referred to as Pegasus, which a Citizen Lab investigation showed was made by an Israel-based organization called NSO Group. It was acquired by the US firm Francisco Partners Management six years ago, according to Lookout and Citizen. Lookout referred to Pegasus as the most sophisticated attack it has seen, sneakily accessing calls, cameras, email, passwords, apps and more on iPhones. The spyware was detected when used against Ahmed Mansoor, a human rights activist in the United Arab Emirates, who has been repeatedly targeted using spyware. After receiving a suspicious text with a link, he reported the matter to Citizen Lab, which worked in conjunction with San Francisco-based Lookout to research the affair. "The attack sequence, boiled down, is a classic phishing scheme: send text message, open web browser, load page, exploit vulnerabilities, install persistent software to gather information," the joint blog post said. "This, however, happens invisibly and silently, such that victims do not know they've been compromised." Mansoor received text messages on August 10 and 11 promising that secrets about detainees being tortured in UAE jails could be accessed by clicking on an enclosed link, researchers said. Had he fallen for the ruse, the Trident chain of "zero-day exploits" would have broken into his iPhone and installed snooping software. Once infected, Mansoor's iPhone would have been turned into a "spy in his pocket" capable of tracking his whereabouts and conversations, Citizen Lab said. Mansoor was targeted five years ago with FinFisher spyware and again the following year with Hacking Team spyware, according to Citizen Lab research. "The use of such expensive tools against Mansoor shows the lengths that governments are willing to go to target activists," the researchers said. Although the cyber attack on Mansoor was not linked to a specific government, Citizen Lab said indicators pointed to the UAE. UAE authorities did not comment on the matter. Lookout and Citizen believe the spyware has been "in the wild for a significant amount of time." "It is also being used to attack high-value targets for multiple purposes, including high-level corporate espionage on iOS, Android and Blackberry." Citizen Lab has also found evidence that "state-sponsored actors" used NSO weapons against a Mexican journalist who reported on high-level corruption in that country and on an unknown target in Kenya. The NSO tactics included impersonating sites such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, the British government's visa application processing website, and a wide range of news organizations and major technology companies, the researchers said. Mansoor's decision to enlist Citizen Lab instead of falling into the trap gave researchers a rare chance to expose the work of "shady cyber arms dealers" who command high prices for morally questionable services, Lookout vice president of security research Mike Murray told AFP. Invoices posted online have shown that hackers can charge tens of thousands of dollars per target hit with their software. "The smartphone is a valuable target, and breaking into it is a valuable skill set," Murray said. "People who can do this, and with wiggle room in their moral code, have realized the business opportunity." NSO Group has been around since 2010 and the capture of one of its weapons was billed as a first. Studying Trident has helped cyber defenders find ways to spot spyware that had been operating unseen, and they are "actively catching it in the wild now," Murray said. He declined to reveal anything about other targets, saying that they were people likely to be under surveillance in other ways by local authorities. Citizen Lab saw the attack on Mansoor as further evidence that "lawful intercept" spyware has significant abuse potential, and that some governments can't resist the temptation to use such tools against political opponents, journalists and human rights defenders.

THE Apple Farm at Snitterfield is to play host to The Big Apple 10k on Sunday, 11th September. The run forms part of a family fun day that is a fundraiser for Macmillan Cancer Support. Just 100 places are available. Katy McGowan, who is running the event, chose the name The Big Apple as she will be heading to New York in November to run The New York Marathon — also in aid of Macmillan.

Like other big companies before it, including Walmart and Google, Apple recently received a federal designation for its energy subsidiary that allows it to become a wholesale seller of electricity from coast to coast. In effect, Apple is creating its own green utility company, although the main customer is itself. The motives may be economic as much as they are environmental. As a wholesaler, Apple could reduce the cost of its electricity load, which reached 831 million kilowatt-hours in the last fiscal year — enough to power about 76,000 homes for a year. But like a growing number of corporations, Apple is intent on reducing carbon dioxide emissions from electricity production — one of the biggest sources of greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming. In one ambitious venture, Apple has contracted with First Solar to begin buying a little less than half of the power later this year from California Flats, a solar energy farm now under construction. Under the terms of the deal, Apple will pay $848 million for the electricity over 25 years and receive the farm’s total output by the end of the agreement. It is one of largest commercial clean energy contracts yet. Lisa Jackson, the former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency who is now the Apple executive overseeing environmental policy, social initiatives and worldwide government affairs, said she hopes Apple will serve as a model for the many other big corporate power users that are now embracing clean energy. “This is just another sort of innovative way to get that power onto the grid so we don’t have to take the California grid-mix default, which still includes fossil fuel,” Jackson said. Although much of Apple’s manufacturing is done offshore, it still has extensive needs for electric power in the United States — and not only for the sprawling corporate complex it is building at its headquarters in Cupertino, and its 270 retail stores around the country. One of Apple’s biggest demands for electricity comes from operating the computing cloud through which it sells apps, music and videos to users of its iPhones, iPads and Mac computers. Apple’s move comes as prices for renewable energy continue to plummet. And signing long-term contracts allows businesses to shield themselves from potentially higher, more volatile charges from a power company. Apple would not say how much it is paying for California Flats’ energy, but Jackson said last year at a Wall Street Journal conference that it is less than what it paid for commercial power. She said she expects the company to save hundreds of millions of dollars over the life of the contract. Google, which received its federal energy wholesale designation from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in 2010, is a big proponent of the approach Apple is now taking. “Running any kind of business, having predictability in terms of your operating costs can be very important,” said Gary Demasi, director of operations for data center energy and location strategy at Google, which has been a leading investor in and user of clean energy. “Renewable energy, from a cost perspective, is now competitive with other forms of energy, much more so than it was a few years ago.” In the United States, the generating capacity of corporate clean energy projects has more than doubled each year since 2013, according to the Business Renewables Center at the Rocky Mountain Institute, which tracks publicly announced deals. In 2015, 11 companies signed up for 3.23 gigawatts’ worth of projects, roughly the equivalent of five coal plants and up from 1.18 gigawatts the year before. Executives face greater pressure from shareholders and customers to show that they are doing their part to fight climate change. At the same time, corporate energy use has exploded, driven in many cases by the ravenous demands of the data cloud. “We are all becoming very large energy players, and this is a shift,” said Brian Janous, director of energy strategy at Microsoft. “Energy is not something that Microsoft or Amazon or Google really ever had to think much about prior to the advent of the cloud.” Helping drive that shift are environmental groups like the World Resources Institute. In May, it helped create the Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance, a coalition of nonprofits that has more than 60 corporations in its network, including McDonald’s and General Motors, as well as Google and Walmart. Electric utilities have begun to respond by creating services to meet the corporate demand for clean energy, said Letha Tawney, the World Resources Institute’s director of utility innovation. One is a green tariff. It was pioneered in North Carolina by Duke Energy and is now under consideration in about a dozen states. It allows companies to designate that they are paying for a renewable energy supply. Another is a synthetic or virtual power purchase agreement, under which companies contract to buy the output of a clean power plant, as Apple is doing with California Flats. Although the companies say these arrangements mean they are running their businesses on renewable energy, in reality the clean power often does not flow directly to their facilities. They typically buy the renewable energy in amounts to match what they draw from the grid — a system of swaps that Jackson of Apple likened to using an ATM. “The dollar you deposit in the bank might not be the exact same bill that you get out,” she said. Robert F. Shapiro, a partner at the law firm Chadbourne & Parke who focuses on project finance and energy, describes it as meaningful symbolism. “They’re actually getting power from their local utility, which may be coal,” Shapiro said. “But they’re deemed to have put into the world carbon-neutral energy, which they are deemed to have used for their load.” To keep track of the clean energy credits, power generators work with registries to issue numbered certificates. “The power flows into the grid. The electrons go where they go,” Tawney said. “But because there’s a renewable-energy certificate, no one else can claim the same zero-carbon benefit.” Such complexities are necessary, executives and clean energy advocates say, because it is not often feasible to install enough renewable-power generators at corporate sites to meet companies’ full energy needs. Walmart, despite having installed solar panels, wind turbines and fuel cells at stores and distribution centers, can nonetheless meet only about a third of those operations’ energy needs. So it also buys renewable energy from generators and utilities, said David Ozment, director of energy at Walmart stores. At Apple, where the purchase or production of renewable energy has more than tripled since 2012, the company would prefer to not have to go to great lengths to ensure a clean energy supply, Jackson said. But the public energy grid is simply still too dependent on carbon fuels to make that possible. “If we had our preference, we’d just be able to say, ‘We want 100 percent green power everywhere we use power,’” Jackson said. “The best would be if we could run every one of our stores, every one of our data centers, every office complex, every building we have, on 100 percent renewable — and if we didn’t have to spend a whole bunch of our time and energy figuring out how to get that done.” Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.

But it says it won’t bury Frank Ocean and other acts in its search results. by Peter Kafka Aug 26, 2016, 4:43pm EDT tweet share Linkedin Jason Merritt / Getty Images Spotify doesn’t like it when big-name acts take their music to Apple or Tidal first. But it’s not punishing them when they do, by making their stuff harder to find in the music service’s search results, the company says. That accusation, sourced to anonymous sources in a Bloomberg report out today, is “unequivocally false,” says a Spotify rep. That makes sense, since it would be bad for Spotify’s business if its users had a hard time finding music they wanted from the likes of Drake and Kanye West, who have brought new releases to Apple and Tidal before releasing it on Spotify. Spotify wouldn’t comment on other charges, levied by sources in reports from Bloomberg and the New York Times, that Spotify wasn’t going to go out of its way to promote releases from acts that went to rivals first. That would make much more sense, since Spotify will want some way to signal that artists shouldn’t engage in exclusives, which Apple and Tidal have secured by giving artists some combination of cash, equity and marketing support. For instance: Frank Ocean’s new album “Blonde” debuted exclusively on Apple Music this weekend, and industry sources say it will stay there for another week or two. When that exclusive winds up, Spotify will want to make it available to its 100 million customers instead of giving them a reason to move to Apple, which says it has 15 million subscribers. (Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly reported Spotify’s user numbers.) But it will want to make the case to Ocean and other artists that they would ultimately have done better if they had let Spotify give it a full promotional push from the get-go. “Blonde’s” Apple Music release this weekend triggered an internal announcement from Universal Music Group CEO Lucian Grainge, where Grainge said he wanted to stop future exclusives. But even the head of the world’s biggest music label won’t be able to stop exclusives if Apple and Tidal want to keep paying up for them. That’s in part because some superstars on his labels will have the clout to get them, simply because other big stars did. Meanwhile, other stars on different labels have different deals and leverage. Beyonce, for instance, has a deal with Sony but is also a part-owner in Tidal, controlled by her husband Jay Z. She is streaming “Lemonade,” her last album, exclusively through Tidal, though she eventually let Apple and other services sell downloads. Frank Ocean’s example is the most intriguing, since he released “Blonde” on his own, after finishing up a contract with Universal. That makes him the most recent artist to become famous while signed to a major label, and then try releasing music on their own. Prince did it back in the CD era, and Radiohead tried it nine years ago with “In Rainbows.” Eventually, though, most artists who have gone out on their own have ended up working with big labels again, at least for some parts of their music-selling operations. Because while it is easy enough to record your own music, promoting it and distributing it have been hassles. And even really famous acts often like getting money before they make something, instead of hoping to make money when it sells. But those examples all come from the pre-streaming era. Now, when streaming dominates, and a handful of platforms dominate streaming, it may be feasible for big acts to record their stuff and hand it to Apple, Tidal and Spotify on their own terms. Which means the big labels will have to work hard — and pay up — to convince big acts to stick with them. recode_divider More From Recode Doctors should think like mechanics, says Color CEO Othman Laraki Twitter’s China head says bye — adding another top exec departure to the heap as 2016 ends Courier-loving Trump claims he knows ‘things that other people don’t know’ about hacking Kevin Sessums’s reaction to Facebook’s temporary ban is, well, very pointed Recode Daily: Obama hits Russia with sanctions and expulsions for election hacking Recode and The Verge count down the 10 biggest tech stories of 2016 Trending Courier-loving Trump claims he knows ‘things that other people don’t know’ about hacking Kevin Sessums’s reaction to Facebook’s temporary ban is, well, very pointed Twitter’s China head says bye — adding another top exec departure to the heap as 2016 ends Doctors should think like mechanics, says Color CEO Othman Laraki Recode and The Verge count down the 10 biggest tech stories of 2016 More in Trending Newsletters Recode Daily Top stories of the day.

Worse yet, as Apple continues to demand lower prices for more labor and more products, we see companies trying to push back on the giant. It’s still not enough for the people toiling at the factories, though, according to advocacy group China Labor Watch. CLW talked with employees inside parts supplier Pegatron and found hazardous working conditions, poor management of about 100,000 workers and cover-ups that have helped the company pass Apple’s welfare inspection. Conditions have deteriorated as CLW gathered paystubs and  accounts from 2015 into this year. Hanging laundry inside a workers’ dormitory. At Pegatron’s Shanghai complex, the company raised wages in accordance with local law, but made its workforce take on welfare cuts and insurance deductions. An hourly wage of $1.85 went up to $2 in actual terms, but actually fell to $1.60 post-deductions. Overtime is rampant, mismanaged and has led to student interns working more than regulations allow for and one employee garnering 293 hours of work in a month. Add to that a security regimen that cuts break time and paid time and denials of leave, and everything falls apart. Monthly wages have fallen since March. As the minimum wage went up in April and May, real monthly income fell thanks to those deductions. On average, maintenance department workers made $615.50 in March, $486.68 in April and $474.08 in May. 2,015 were analyzed dating back as far as May 2015. China Labor Watch’s report blames not only Pegatron for skirting safety and wage laws, but Apple also for dedicating only $11.3 billion or 4.8 percent of its total revenue last year to buying products made by some 1.6 million Chinese laborers. Apple has responded to previous reports from CLW, assuring the public that it investigates problems and makes sure every supply chain worker gets treated right, but it seems that inaction has spoken louder than words. Not uncommon for multinational conglomerates to fail at this. Source: China Labor Watch Via: 9to5Mac Advertisement likethis What's your reaction?

Artists who have given Apple premier access to new music have been told that their songs won’t be placed on featured playlists. The Swedish music company has been using such practices for about a year, say sources, and the efforts have escalated during the past few months. Artists who have given exclusives to Jay-Z’s Tidal streaming service have seen similar forms of retaliation. Artists who have given Apple exclusive access to new music have been told they won’t be able to get their tracks on featured playlists once the songs become available on Spotify, said the people, who declined to be identified discussing the steps. Those artists have also found their songs buried in the search rankings of Spotify, the world’s largest music-streaming service, the people said. Spotify said it doesn’t alter search rankings. […] The company has threatened to use its retaliatory practices on lesser-known artists who introduce music on a Beats One show hosted by DJ Zane Lowe, an architect of Apple’s radio service, the people said. One representative of a singer-songwriter said the client canceled plans to debut a song on Lowe’s show because of concern that the artist would lose promotion from Spotify. The agent asked not to be identified, and that the artist not be named, to avoid damaging relationships with the music-streaming companies. Spotify is in a tough spot right now. It’s currently trying to lower its revenue sharing obligations with record labels, and has eyes on filing for IPO by the end of 2017. The company didn’t turn a profit at all last year, despite earning over $2 billion in revenue. So there’s a war going on between streaming services, between artists and streaming services, and between artists and their record labels. All over exclusivities. Earlier this week it was reported that UMG has banned its musicians from making exclusive deals. Source: Bloomberg Update: Spotify tells Recode that Bloomberg’s report regarding it altering search results is “unequivocally false.” Share: Tweet Follow: Follow @iDownloadBlog We Recommend djay Pro for iPhone is out: 4-deck mixing, waveform haptics, 3D Touch cue points & more Spotify could finally turn a profit in 2017, expand to China, Russia & South Korea Neil Young music returns to Apple Music and other streaming services First user-created music remixes about to launch on Apple Music and Spotify Related Topics Apple Music, Music, News, Spotify, Tidal Melvco So Spotify is saying that all of these artists Bloomberg spoke with are lying? Or is this plausible deniability? Also it doesn’t seem like they’re denying that they intentionally leave [unfavorable] artists off featured playlists, which is still pretty sketchy. “Here are this week’s top hip hop artists (minus that one guy who signed a deal with Apple Music)” Marko 31 I am going to quit my Spotify subscription right now and by myself new iphone 7 and subscribe to apple music because its the best. Josh Venegas Apple Music sucks dude. You’ll be sorely disappointed. Millticket Agreed, still buggy and all that shit, Spotify is atleast well usable for free if you got the right tweaks. Loke So long as Apple Music pushes Beats Rap and Hip Hop crap long live Spotify. Apple Music sucks absolutely hate it. Carlos B Rap/Hip Hop is the new rock (in terms of popularity etc., also coming from a rock fan). They’d be stupid not to push it. Chris Ryan rap/hip hop is dead guys, has been for years…atleast to mainstream djs and radio Loke I understand that doesn’t mean I can’t complain! I guess the world just sickens me. Every day I see young people of all races listening to hardcore gangster crap rap and all I can is shake my head when I really want to snack them on theirs. My first two albums were Zenyata Mondata and Tatoo You. They blew my mind with actual musical talent.. Apple has become a turn off for me for reasons like this among others. Guess the middle aged white guy just isn’t there target market. But F it K digress… matthewmspace Hey, I’m 20 and I also hate that Beats 1 plays nothing but hip hop. I wish they’d play more classic rock, or at least have multiple stations. P Loke Agreed there is so much amazing music out there to discover and they flaunt the absolute edge of what can be considere true music. bashir Tell him more bashir Yeah Carlos B Just waiting for Apple to acquire Tidal to nail Spotify’s coffin. Sharkey311 Scumbag Spotify. Not surprised. Gabriel Anaya So let me get this straight. They’re trying to get more exclusives but at the same time, trying to pay less than before and now they’re being assholes behind the scenes to artists who make some deals with other providers. They wonder why they’re not making profits? They wonder why they’re not getting any big exclusives lately? Bayetae Shropshire HipHop along with other genres of music is personal preference. There is no bad or good music in a sense. Music is like food, it’s very selective to the individual based on his or hers likes or dislikes but that doesn’t mean it’s bad overall or good overall. It’s enjoyed by those who like it and disliked by those who hate it. bashir Exactly Xee Spotify aren’t punishing the Artists they are punishing the middleman ie UMG etc that are money making bloodsucking wastes of space. Musicians should sell their music direct to streaming services and take all of the profits.

Monday, August 22, 2016 · 2:28 pm · 24 Comments “One of the most important succession plans in corporate history will hit a milestone this week,” Steven Russolillo writes for The Wall Street Journal. “Five years ago, Apple Inc.’s iconic and visionary co-founder Steve Jobs passed the torch to his handpicked successor, Tim Cook. The official transition took place six weeks before Mr. Jobs passed away.” “Now Apple is the world’s largest company by market value and remains one of the most influential. Its $53 billion in net income last year was greater than the combined earnings of technology behemoths Facebook Inc., Google’s parent Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp.,” Russolillo writes. “At the same time, though, Apple’s growth is slowing, its stock is stagnating and it is facing more concerns than ever about its future. Underscoring all of this is one key question that Mr. Cook will likely never escape: Are Apple’s best days behind it?” “Its valuation is cheap, but it has been cheap for years,” Russolillo writes. “The worry that Apple doesn’t have another truly revolutionary product up its sleeve is what weighs on the stock.” Read more in the full article here. MacDailyNews Take: Those who are worried that Apple after Steve Jobs doesn’t have revolutionary products up its collective sleeve do not understand Apple Inc. nor do they wear an Apple Watch.

I think the company still has the chops to take Apple to new heights, now if that translates to a high stock price is hard to say but I expect the company will still make great products regardless of what the vultures on Wall Street think. auramac Monday, August 22, 2016 - 5:07 pm · Reply You reveal yourself to be a clueless homophobic troll. Your opinions and prejudice are sewer-worthy. iblueconsulting Monday, August 22, 2016 - 7:20 pm · Reply It is not a “homophobic”comment. It is just reality check. Cook is not a visionary, not allowing any visionary to come into the light. He controls the company with strong grip, milking away profits from past products, but get real, iPhone is the only thing that keeps Apple floating. I myself cannot wear any kind of watch (it causes me some sort of skin reaction), so I am not a consumer of watches (as many people that I know, though they do not have any kind of issueswith it like me). Apple needs (badly) the next great thing. As Jobs once said, who cares about iPhone (Apple ][)? It will be dead in a few years from now. No, let me say that again: Apple needs to recreate mobile industry again. We are stuck with expensive plans, limite data plans, poor network coverage (try to travel from Boston to Phil watching movies on Youtube), and lame apps. We need something better, we deserve something, than Tim Cook. peterblood71 Monday, August 22, 2016 - 8:46 pm · Reply Who’re you trying to convince moron? Yourself? You have Apple Bashing Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. A seriously sick dude. And you were NEVER an Apple fanboy troll. Nothing you say is remotely constructive, only the spew of a jackass.

Time to roll out the “Apple Has Lost It’s Mojo” boilerplate. Bo Monday, August 22, 2016 - 3:12 pm · Reply Looking at their R&D spending, you know for sure Apple has dozens of significant products in the works. Maybe half of them don’t reach the market and a lot are BT earbuds and mice and such, but we all know they have a handful of game changers in the works. With sales at the levels Apple has, they have to be very prepared from the standpoint of reliability, component quality, supply levels & total assurance that they don’t have “early failures.” Hence, I fully understand why it takes so long to make a major introduction. This fall is going to be very interesting! grubner Monday, August 22, 2016 - 3:14 pm · Reply Apple is no longer the company it was under Jobs–no matter how we all wish it was the same, it can never be. Apple is in maintain mode–like what Steve referred to ‘when the salesmen takeover’. We are not completely there yet, but the train is leaving the station. Cook is not an idea man which is what Apple needs at the top to BE Apple. IMO Apple will always continue to be a huge revenue generator but they are largely living off the fuel of the former greatness. It brings me no pleasure saying that. I wish very much that i could say differently. peterblood71 Monday, August 22, 2016 - 3:26 pm · Reply Easy to say since we really have no idea how Steve Jobs would have done in this same time period, facing many of the same challenges. Even Steve Jobs could not wish paradigm busting disruptive technology out of thin air and there were long periods between real Jobs innovation and new devices. *Sigh* – how quickly we forget. iPods, iPhones and iPads follow a logical line of introduction and similarity overlap. It’s when you get out of those “easy pickings” technology areas it becomes harder. Not to mention when a form factor becomes mature. And Tim is not dependent only on himself for future trends and ideas – he has his Apple crew to depend on, just as Jobs did. Jobs didn’t dream up the technology on his own, only saw what was then existing and how it could be put together in the most appealing and useful way. Or challenging his team to make it even better. Personally one of the few complaints I have is the misguided 2013 Mac Pro, which certainly was not designed for all pro users chewing satisfaction needs. One size (or model) does not fit all. Let’s hope for a real re-focus on the Mac, in all it’s flavors. MichelPM Monday, August 22, 2016 - 6:44 pm · Reply @ Peterblood. You are mistaken and forgetful. When Steve returned to Apple and forward and up to his death, we had a LOT of new innovations. The iMac (many different versions of which were groundbreaking and innovative. Remember the lamp/snowball iMac?) The ”G” line of Mac, especially the G5 lineup. The BIG SWITCH to Intel from PowerPC Macs. All of the iPod lineups of which I really miss the last classic 256 GB iPod. The iPhone and then the introduction of the iPad just before his death. Apple was plenty busy with great innovations from 2000-2010. The only thing that Tim Cook has contributed to Apple, on his watch, is a watch which is not a “must have” device, like an iPhone/iPad or Mac, and an expensive and, initially, underpowered Mac Pro which looks great, but needs lots of expensive and cluttering add-ons to make a real Pro machine. Apple needs to rethink to Mac Pro and the desktop Mac lineup. Apple really needs to go back to offering a mid-grade/mid-priced Mac for pro use, OTHER THAN AN iMac! peterblood71 Monday, August 22, 2016 - 8:38 pm · Reply Hardly. I am not forgetful, you are compressing the time frame. I was there for all of it since the beginning. And you miss the interpretation of some of those events. Merely switching from IBM to Intel chips wasn’t an innovation, it was necessary since PowerPC chips weren’t going anywhere, and ran too hot. (I am taking a dead G5 Power PC Mac Pro to Apple for recycling tonight.) IBM essentially lied to Job as to their roadmap, which was a dead end for Apple. Some would look at even using Power PC chip as Jobs folly, finally having to capitulate and go to Intel like the Dark Side’s preference. My point is it wasn’t one massive innovation after another under Job’s watch but a steady progression of smaller ones, and today the standard is placed much higher, people are jaded. Higher than probably anyone in the Apple CEO job can probably ever hope to satisfy. Make no mistake Jobs had his moments but the bigger question is where could he have taken it? Or would he face the same problem Tim Cook has today of over-expectations? It will be interesting to see what will come out of all the R&D Apple has been doing. I agree there are plenty of basic areas Apple could and should do better at. As discussed many times on this site the Mac Pro debacle and upgrading of Macs and different form factors for the Mac. As the article said it really is the next 3-5 years that will see if Tim Cook has what it takes. I hope good things are coming and not something wicked this way comes. MichelPM Monday, August 22, 2016 - 8:52 pm · Reply peterblood71 Not really compressing anything. When SJ came back to Apple, we had, first, the iMac and a few years and two designs, next the iPods, next the newer G3 and new G4, G5 lineup, the introduction of the MacMini, next gen Intel Macs and various new iMac/MacBook/MacMini designs, then the iPhone and then the iPads. Have I missed anything? I am a 20+ year Apple veteran (survived the Amelio/Spindler death days of Apple). Been through all of this, too! peterblood71 Monday, August 22, 2016 - 9:09 pm · Reply I still respectfully disagree. Iterations of existing Mac products is not big “innovation.” The 1984 Mac WAS innovative. (With the possible exception of the fruity iMacs I guess.) (Jobs should be given credit for his non-Apple developments as well in NeXT which of course became OS X.) We’re talking about the main innovation events with new products. By today’s standard mere upgrades are not the innovation people expect to see. They’re already bored with real upgrade improvements in the iPhone and iPad line even though solid. I guess we’re entitled to see things a little “differently.” MichelPM Monday, August 22, 2016 - 9:08 pm · Reply Apple simply IS NOT innovating like they did when Jobs was still alive. Jobs pushed his employees to get things done whether they like this approach or not. He was a visionary, but he was a task master, as well. He wanted results and postive results! I do not see any of this drive or passion for Apple and its products in Tim Cook! His presentations at Keynote events puts me to sleep. Cook really needs to make someone else the spokesperson for Apple. Like maybe Craig Federighi or Phill Schiller (if he lost a little more weight). I see no “spark” in Tim Cook! I just see someone who choosen as a someone competent enough to run a Fortune 500 company that is running a company, not his own, and just going through the motions and just keeping Apple making money by just offering derivative products, that are just incrementally (not entirely) new and innovative products! It’s five years, now This is the usual time when Apple has something entirely new and groundbreaking to offer by now. peterblood71 Monday, August 22, 2016 - 9:18 pm · Reply You say they are not innovating but are you privy to what’s going on inside Apple right now? Innovation along the lines of what Steve Jobs did have continued apace. Spectacular innovation has not, but is rare. Perhaps that 5 year window you talk about waiting for the SPECTACULAR INNOVATION EVENT is about to happen. Is an Apple Car enough to satisfy this? What device areas in technology has Apple yet to compete that consumers would crave? To be innovative in something you need a goal, a future product in mind. Macs, iPods, iPhones and iPads, even Apple Watch’s are all computers of varying flavors. What is left? Personally I’d like Apple to use some of their cash on space projects as Elon Musk has done with SpaceX. yojimbo007 Monday, August 22, 2016 - 3:42 pm · Reply Tim is an increadibly capable CEO…… Stop this bogus comparisons and Apple is doomed bs… Apple now and Apple at Steves time are two massively different Animals….

While the rest of the tech companies are soaring, Apple looks as though it’s sputtering. That 800 lb. gorilla in the room is no more. It’s more like a wind-up monkey with the cymbals. As a shareholder it really disappoints me why Apple isn’t ripping off the arms of their rivals or at least attempting to. Apple is always said to be on the bottom of the totem pole and I can’t tell exactly why that is so. Apple has become so passive it’s sickening. botvinnik✓ᵀᴿᵁᴹᴾ Tuesday, August 23, 2016 - 5:50 am · Reply Apple has more important things to do, like squirt gun emojis. 1 2 Next » Add Your Feedback Name (required) Email (required) Web cancel reply Notify me of new comments via email.

Spotify has been punishing artists who agree to Apple Music exclusives, displaying their content less prominently and offering fewer promotional opportunities. Spotify has explicitly told artists who offer Apple Music exclusives that their music won't be included on featured playlists, and Spotify has also "buried" their songs in its search rankings. The music streaming service has reportedly been using these retaliatory tactics for about a year. Spotify has been retaliating against musicians who introduce new material exclusively on rival Apple Music by making their songs harder to find, according to people familiar with the strategy. Artists who have given Apple exclusive access to new music have been told they won't be able to get their tracks on featured playlists once the songs become available on Spotify, said the people, who declined to be identified discussing the steps. Spotify's tactics may not affect major artists in a significant way, but according to Bloomberg, the service has also threatened smaller acts who introduce their music on Beats 1 Radio with Zane Lowe. Since Apple Music launched last year, Apple has been using exclusive content as a way to lure new subscribers to the service. Artists like Drake, Frank Ocean, Dreezy, Taylor Swift, and Katy Perry have debuted content exclusively on Apple Music, something both Spotify and record labels have become increasingly uncomfortable with. Earlier this week, Universal Music Group CEO Lucian Grange told employees that UMG is now prohibiting its artists from offering music exclusives, meaning popular content from Taylor Swift, The Weeknd, Kendrick Lamar, and more, will no longer be eligible for debut solely on Apple Music. UMG's new policy has already affected Apple, preventing Apple Music from inking a deal with Lady Gaga. At its one year anniversary in June, Apple Music boasted more than 15 million subscribers, and should it continue its rapid growth rate, the service could eventually eclipse Spotify as the most popular streaming service. Spotify continues to have approximately twice as many subscribers but the music service continues to struggle because it has yet to become profitable.

Apple Speeds iOS Patch to Bring Down Pegasus Print Email By Richard Adhikari Aug 26, 2016 2:05 PM PT Apple on Thursday issued a patch that addresses three recently discovered critical iOS zero-day vulnerabilities, and advised users to update their systems immediately. State-sponsored actors exploited the flaws to target United Arab Emirates human rights defender Ahmed Mansoor, and a Mexican journalist who reported on government corruption. Researchers at the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab and security firm Lookout discovered the vulnerabilities, which they dubbed "Trident," after investigating suspicious text messages sent to Mansoor. The messages included links to an exploit infrastructure connected with NSO Group, an Israel-based cyberwar company that sells the spyware product Pegasus exclusively to governments, according to Citizen Lab. The NSO Group, which developed Pegasus, is owned by private investment firm Francisco Partners, Citizen Lab said. It reportedly has offered to sell the NSO Group, which it has valued at US$1 billion. The firm previously invested in Blue Coat Systems, which sold products to repressive regimes to aid their mass surveillance and Internet censorship efforts. "Apple's response cements in my mind that it takes security seriously," said Bobby Kuzma, systems engineer at Core Security. "These are very complex exploits ... and Apple has a patch out fixing them 10 days after it was notified," he told TechNewsWorld. "That's nothing short of miraculous." 'Grade A Scary' The Trident vulnerabilities consist of the following: CVE-2016-4657 -- an exploit targeting a previously undocumented corruption vulnerability in WebKit that allows execution of the initial shellcode; CVE-2016-4655 -- a Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization bypass exploit to find the kernel's base address; and CVE-2016-4656 -- 32- and 64-bit iOS kernel exploits targeting a memory corruption vulnerability that allows execution of code in the kernel. They are used to jailbreak an iPhone and allow software installation. "The jailbreak is the key here," Core Security's Kuzma noted. "Once you've broken out of the tightly compartmented application space in iOS, you can effectively and easily bypass all the security controls built into the device and the operating system. This is grade A scary stuff." Pegasus on the Loose The spyware Trident implanted appears to be NSO's Pegasus product, a highly advanced tool that makes use of zero-day flaws, obfuscation, encryption and kernel-level exploitation, Lookout noted. Pegasus can use an iPhone's camera and microphone to eavesdrop on activity. It can record the user's calls over WhatsApp and Viber, logging messages sent in mobile chat apps, and track the user's movements. It includes a renamed copy of Cydia Substrate, a third-party app developer framework that facilitates recording of messages and phone calls from targeted apps, Citizen Lab said. "Pegasus clearly shows the dangers of mobile devices [that] can be transformed into ideal tracking devices," said Yair Amit, CTO of Skycure. "While Pegasus is a sophisticated tool that's likely to be used against specific victims, there are tools that allow attackers with minimal technical background to easily penetrate iOS and Android," he told TechNewsWorld. News of the zero-day exploits led Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., who has a degree in computer science, to call for a congressional hearing on the issue of mobile security. Richard Adhikari has written about high-tech for leading industry publications since the 1990s and wonders where it's all leading to. Will implanted RFID chips in humans be the Mark of the Beast?

By Joel Berg, August 26, 2016 at 5:00 PM It was an early sign of trouble for Apple Pay: Cashiers staring in curiosity as I waved my iPhone in front of credit-card readers. I persisted in pursuit of what I thought would be the future of payments: credit and debit cards linked to smartphones. The so-called mobile wallet is still coming, just not as quickly or in the form you might have expected. The challenge for businesses, especially smaller ones, is to figure out what technology they need to invest in to attract and retain customers. The average American shopper is expected to spend more than $3,000 using mobile devices in 2019, up from an expected $721.47 this year, according to research company eMarketer. Even the biggest technology companies have yet to find the right app to capture that growth. Apple Pay and its cousins, Android Pay and Samsung Pay, are struggling to convince people to stop using plastic and start using their phones, according to industry experts. Retailers like CVS, Starbucks and Walmart, on the other hand, appear to be having more success. Can you pay me now? Walmart Pay is ready for a close-up. Open the app, log in, scan the QR code to pay. - (Joel Berg) The puzzle mobile payments must solve in the U.S. is fairly straightforward: How do you replace what is already a streamlined process? I don’t save much time pulling out my iPhone instead of reaching into my wallet and sliding out a credit card. So far, the shoppers who wield their phones tend to be the people who like to try new things, said Daniel Van Dyke, an analyst with Javelin Strategy & Research, a financial services research firm based in Pleasanton, Calif. The novelty wears off. According to figures from Javelin, people are paying less often with their phones. Between 2013 and 2015, the mean number of monthly transactions per user fell from 3.7 to 3. “That’s because users who stick on the platform realize they’re not getting anything out of it,” Van Dyke said. “It’s a major problem these providers have to address.” To entice users, Android, Apple and Samsung have been handing out incentives. Samsung Pay, for example, offered gift cards this spring to first-time users. Companies also are exploring how to incorporate loyalty rewards.  Retailers, however, don’t have to experiment. They can offer all kinds of rewards from the get-go, starting with the ability to order ahead and skip lines, a feature available from Starbucks, the sandwich chain Subway and others. Walmart Pay, meanwhile, incorporates the company’s promise of low prices. The payment process for Walmart Pay is not much different than the one for Apple Pay, as I learned during a recent demonstration at the Walmart in Silver Spring Township, Cumberland County. But after you buy your goods using Walmart Pay, you can use the app to scan for lower prices at competing retailers. Any savings are totted up and stored on a gift card for spending later. At Walmart, of course. It’s likely someone already is figuring out how to incorporate the app into the Black Friday experience. There will be apps for that The good news for smaller businesses is that they don’t have to jump on the Apple/Android/Samsung Pay bandwagon. The bad news is that they risk being leapfrogged by larger competitors with millions of dollars to invest. “Those companies are transforming the way they receive payments,” said Robb Gaynor, chief product officer at Malauzai, a Texas-based provider of digital banking products. But where there is money, there are solutions. Over the next few years, technology companies, credit card companies and financial institutions are likely to find ways to help smaller businesses accept mobile payments, Gaynor said. In fact, Malauzai recently worked with a community bank in California to develop a payments app for a business customer, Gaynor said. “Our take on it is the banks are in a unique position to help, especially the local businesses,” he said. And if you’re wondering whether people really want a bunch of payment apps on their phones? Consumers are used to juggling credit cards. They will get used to juggling multiple payment apps. “Starbucks ain’t going away and neither is Apple Pay,” Gaynor said. “And neither of them is going to hold all of the market.” More from the Fast Forward Blog • Six predictions for 2017 • Rejecting 'Reefer Madness': Changing laws, changing minds • In season of giving, consider donor-advised funds Share This Story: Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn   Joel Berg Joel Berg is editor of the Central Penn Business Journal.

Time seems to have caught up with Apple, which historically appeared immune to cyber threats with its curated iOS operating system, but this time it has been exposed with three critical weaknesses called "exploits", or attack areas that when combined together, make the phone vulnerable to hackers. This specific hack was in three areas: remotely jail breaking the iPhone, then installing spyware capable of listening in on the camera and microphone and capable of recording locations, WhatsApp and Viber calls and access to texts which is where it was used and detected by the user receiving unknown texts. It was again a customer and 3rd party Citizen Lab working with human rights and pro-democracy activist Ahmed Mansoor, who alerted Apple to the threat rather than Apple being aware of this threat. This is increasingly called "zero day" giving no time to the alert the manufacturer to the attack. The attack seems to have been politically motivated in this case with the human-rights activist receiving unsolicited text but is serious for Apple in that it undermines their brand and ecosystem and hence the rapid patch fix. There are three things to learn from this at least: Increased complexity of these mobile devices where individual system faults my be acceptance but when combined become a cascade failure Just having an encrypted app like whatsapp does not protect your privacy if the operating system it runs on if violated The need for crowdsourcing testing to keep checking and monitoring cyber threats is critical in today's connected business At least in this case Apple responded rapidly with a fix and told us, other companies who delay telling people of the attack or not detecting the attacks continued are a risk to themselves and their customers and others Reference: https://citizenlab.org/2016/08/million-dollar-dissident-iphone-zero-day-nso-group-uae/ Follow Professor Mark Skilton on Twitter: www.twitter.com/mskilton This Blogger's Books and Other Items from...

 Inside 'Pegasus,' the impossible-to-detect software that hacks your iPhone Paul Szoldra Aug. 26, 2016, 4:51 PM 73,243 facebook linkedin twitter email print iStock The hacking software that completely takes over an Apple iPhone and turns it into a mobile surveillance device is pretty terrifying. Built by a shadowy company called NSO Group, the software called "Pegasus" — discovered after being used against a human rights activist in the United Arab Emirates — forced Apple to issue a critical software update on Thursday to protect its users worldwide. Updating iOS to the current 9.3.5 version is crucial for all users, since Pegasus is designed to infect a person's phone and it is virtually impossible to detect. "The software leaves absolutely no indicators of compromise to the user," Mike Murray, vice president of security research and response at Lookout, a mobile security firm that researched the threat with CitizenLab, told Business Insider. One of Murray's fellow researchers told him of how advanced Pegasus is: "Once you get this software on your phone, it’s not your phone anymore." 'This is a real exploit happening in the wild against real people' The revelation of Pegasus started with a text message on Aug. 10. A text sent to the iPhone 6 of Ahmed Mansoor, a prominent human rights activist in the United Arab Emirates, promised "new secrets about torture of Emiratis in state prisons" with a link. Though the phone number it came from was faked, and the text's claims were interesting, he didn't click. "I could tell that these were unusual SMS's," Mansoor told Motherboard. "And I wouldn’t go and [click on] that.” Instead, he sent it to CitizenLab researchers Bill Marczak and John Scott-Railton, who used their own phone to click the link themselves — and then track what would happen next. “What we were looking at were three chained together iOS zero days," Murray told BI.  After clicking the link, the Safari browser quickly opened and then closed. “That's the only indication the user will ever have," Murray said. But in the background, Pegasus was calling back to servers controlled by its creators, then downloading its malicious software, jailbreaking the device, and quickly infecting every aspect of the phone from messaging software to its repository of WiFi passwords with three "zero day" vulnerabilities, or unfixed bugs that can be exploited by hackers. After CitizenLab brought in Lookout to help in discovering what Pegasus could do, the researchers immediately called Apple to report it. "This is a real exploit happening in the wild against real people," said Murray, noting that neither research group submitted it through Apple's official bug bounty program, which could have earned them upwards of $200,000. “This wasn’t about money. This is about real people in the world being attacked.” AP 'I think it is an arms race' In their research, Citizen Lab and Lookout realized that Pegasus was designed to do two things: completely take over all aspects of the iPhone, and operate like a "ghost" that a user would never be able to see. "The joke with spyware is 'suddenly my battery goes from 6 hours to 30 minutes,'" Murray said. "Pegasus doesn’t do that." What it does do is gather an incredible amount of data on an affected user. Every single text message, calendar entry, email sent through Gmail, or WhatsApp message is vacuumed up and sent back to whoever is behind the spying. It constantly updates and sends the user's location from the phone's GPS. And it even fully downloads the user's various passwords and steals the stored list of WiFi networks and passwords the phone connects to. A screenshot from NSO Group’s Pegasus Working Station software, showing locations of infected devices (as of March 2012). Leaked Hacking Team Emails via CitizenLab Not surprisingly, it can intercept audio from calls, to include those made through WhatsApp and Skype, or the microphone can be remotely turned on to listen in. "Your smartphone today is the new walkie-talkie," NSO Group cofounder Omri Lavie told the Financial Times in 2013. "We’re a complete ghost," he told Defense News of his sophisticated spy software. "We’re totally transparent to the target, and we leave no traces." Since its discovery, Murray said, the NSO command-and-control servers the researchers found Pegasus communicating with have all been taken down. But it has built-in protections for updating these servers, so it's likely this discovery may be nothing more than a bump in the road for the company behind it. "The level of stealth it has, [and] the level of protections it has against its own infrastructure being destroyed or itself being discovered is quite incredible," Murray said. “I think it speaks to the sophistication of the threat ... this was designed to maintain persistence and maintain the compromise a lot longer than what you typically see in a lot of malware." When asked whether a hardware solution, such as Edward Snowden's proposed case for the iPhone, may be what users need to protect themselves, Murray said it would make it "harder" for attackers, but dismissed claims it could be a silver bullet. “I think it's an arms race," he said. "As soon as we try and do it with hardware, the sophisticated attacker is simply going to work harder to blend into the background.” "People are patching up certain holes and they’re just finding new holes," Blake Kotiza, vice president of sales for Privoro, a manufacturer of anti-spying hardware for the iPhone, told Business Insider. "It’s a continuous game of cat and mouse." Apple released an update to its mobile operating system iOS on Thursday, which fixes the three zero-day exploits that were uncovered. Users who update to iOS 9.3.5 are, for now, protected against Pegasus. An Apple spokesperson also confirmed to Business Insider that the latest update to the iOS 10 beta software is protected as well. Murray's company, Lookout, also has an app that scans phones for security threats, which can now tell users whether their device has been compromised. “Now that we know what to look for, it’s much more effective," Murray said. But the company behind Pegasus is still in business, and it's likely working hard to find another way to break into the iPhone, which is believed to have been vulnerable going all the way back to iOS 7. It had previously demonstrated hacks on Blackberry and Android devices. “It’s the best out there we’ve seen," Murray said. "Who knows what other shady groups are still out there lurking, waiting to be discovered.” EXCLUSIVE FREE REPORT: 25 Big Tech Predictions by BI Intelligence.

By Conner Forrest | August 26, 2016, 12:50 PM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: Nate Ralph/CNET According to a patent filed by Apple and approved on Thursday, the iPhone or iPad could eventually capture and store a fingerprint, an image, audio, and video of a thief who attempts to use the device after it is stolen. The patent, originally reported by AppleInsider, was initially filed on April 29, 2016. The patent abstract stated that the capture of biometric data could potentially occur when certain "trigger conditions" are met. Additional metadata could be used to complement the information captured on the thief. There are a quite a few options for what could constitute a trigger, including a certain number of failed login attempts, or even potentially using machine learning to determine when to capture the data. Parameters could also be set by the user to initiate the information capture if a certain set of actions are attempted. The patent also notes that the process would seek to capture the abovementioned information "without making said unauthorized user aware of said capture." The patent also said that the information may be stored in an encrypted manner remotely or locally. However, the patent also mentioned that the information would be "purged" at certain intervals to save space on the device. SEE: Mobile device computing policy template (Tech Pro Research) As also noted by AppleInsider, there are currently five attempts available for an individual user to access an iOS device before they are forced to input the passcode. If the user can't get the passcode in 10 tries, the phone will lock up. So, for parents of small children, this could mean you'll see a lot of pictures of your kid if they get ahold of your phone, but that's where the purging comes in. More about IT Security Video: 5 things to know about ethical hacking Five ways to maintain your privacy on your smartphone, no downloads required Firms that force you to change your password are clueless says cyber security chief Subscribe to TechRepublic's Cybersecurity Insider newsletter The patent contains some troubling language as well. Take this excerpt: "For example, a captured fingerprint may be compared to a database containing fingerprints of known users (such as fingerprints of all users of a cellular service network that have been captured by the cellular service network). By way of another example, a number of captured keystrokes entered by an unauthorized user may be grouped and analyzed to determine one or more operations that the unauthorized user was attempting to perform utilizing the computing device (such as access a digital music purchasing account accessible from the computing device)." The comparison of fingerprints, and the potential logging of keystrokes in an attempt to determine what the unauthorized user was trying to do, may pose some ethical concerns. This is especially troubling after Apple's long battle with the FBI over the encryption on the iPhone of the San Bernardino shooter. On the flip side, the addition of the feature could help law enforcement track down and prosecute smartphone thieves. Either way, at this point it's just a patent, and it may never make to production on the iPhone or iPad at all. What do you think? Would this feature be beneficial, or is it an invasion of privacy? Tell us in the comments. The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers A new Apple patent could mean that stolen iPhones would capture and store the fingerprint of a thief, as well as their photo and audio and video. The patent mentions specific triggers that could be used to initiate the capturing of information, with the potential for machine learning to make the call. This potential feature could raise some red flags over its potential privacy implications and the ethical concerns of using a database of fingerprints to compare users.

X EU to rule against Ireland in Apple tax case Tax deal found to be illegal state aid but Apple’s tax bill to Ireland will be far less than originally suggested Fri, Aug 26, 2016, 20:39 Cliff Taylor Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO and Taoiseach Enda Kenny meet at at Apple’s campus in Cork, Ireland in 2014. The EU Commission is preparing to issue a final ruling that Ireland’s tax deal with Apple represented illegal state aid.         The EU Commission is preparing to issue a final ruling that Ireland’s tax deal with Apple represented illegal state aid. However sources believe the amount of tax Ireland will be asked to collect from the US giant will be much less than the billions of euro which had been originally suggested by some analysts. Court challenge The Government and Apple will immediately signal that they will challenge the ruling in the European courts, a process that could take some years. Sources say that government and the US company remain in “lock step” on the issue. When the EU Commission issued its preliminary adverse finding in 2014, which was that it believed that the Irish government had given Apple illegal state aid, some estimates were that it would seek to oblige Ireland to collect as much as €18 billion to €19 billion in taxes dating backing to the 1990s. EU to rule Apple owes State billions in back tax EU to find Apple owes Ireland billions in back taxes Q&A: What exactly is at stake in the Apple tax issue? Smaller sum Sources now believe the likely outcome will involve a much smaller sum. While the precise terms of the EU Commission decision - and whether it will mention an actual figure - remain unclear, sources believe that the sum involved is likely to be in the hundreds of millions rather than the billions. One suggestion is that Ireland could be pressed to recoup somewhere between €500 million and €1 billion from Apple. However the final terms of the commission decision are not yet fully clear. While this amount of money would not be significant for Apple, both it and the Irish government are believed certain to appeal any ruling. Both Apple and the Government have denied any wrongdoing. Earlier this year the EU Competition Commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, told the Minister for Finance, Michael Noonan, that the decision could come in September or October. Sources now believe it may emerge late next week or early the following week. ADVERTISEMENT White paper The Apple case has become a highly controversial issue between the EU Commission and Washington. Earlier this week, the US Treasury published a White Paper arguing that the EU Commission was exceeding its powers in its tax investigations. In what was seen as a clear reference to the Apple case, it also made a strong argument that the EU Commission should not seek to recoup back tax dating back years from the companies involved. Apple is just one of a number of companies whose tax affairs the Commission is investigating, but it is by far the most high profile of the cases involved. An adverse ruling is likely to heighten tensions between Brussels and Washington. The white paper suggested that the treasury was considering retaliatory measures, and also that the tax disputes could have a “chilling” impact on any trans-Atlantic investment. The Irish government has repeatedly insisted that Apple did not get any “special” date, but the low level of tax paid by Apple of profits moved through Ireland - often 2 per cent or less - has proved highly controversial.       Read More Apple could face major Irish tax bill after EU ruling Ireland risks being trampled in US/EU corporate tax fight Ireland set for damage limitation over EU decision on Apple tax Business week: crunch time for Apple, the EU and US US steps up pressure on EU ahead of Apple’s Irish tax ruling Cliff Taylor: US sets down big marker in European tax battle Joseph Stiglitz attacks Apple’s Irish tax regime Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Transport & Tourism Why Ryanair is offering package holidays now Work Millennials start new year with old-school paper diaries and pens English Soccer Jermain Defoe double leaves Liverpool frustrated Irish Times After 2016, economic forecasting for 2017 has got to be perilous Sponsored Making a difficult fertility journey a lot less lonely Redbreast Lustau: an old friend with a new whiskey perspective Infertility and the workplace: one woman's experience Do you know how much you’ll save by switching health plan?

The rookie cornerback, a first-round draft pick from Ohio State, will return Saturday night to play against the Jets after missing the preseason game in Buffalo with a left knee injury suffered in the opener with the Dolphins. Apple spent several days standing on the side during practice, and admitted it is “very important’’ for him to get back onto the field for this game. “You want to show your teammates that you’re a physical player and you can play in this league,’’ Apple said. After working some in the slot position – an unfamiliar role for him – Apple mostly lined up at left cornerback in the latter stages of training camp, and that is where he is likely to wind up at the beginning of his NFL career. Apple is not a starter, but he will play in sub packages within the defense. “It’s helped because you can just focus on one thing and just master what the coaches are trying to tell you to do,’’ Apple said. “I pride myself still on being versatile. If they ask me to go in the slot, I’ll definitely do it 100 percent. Right now I’m just trying to master outside corner.’’ Apple is hoping he gets a shot at covering Brandon Marshall or Eric Decker, and figures getting a look at Marshall will be excellent preparation in case he has to line up against Dez Bryant in the season opener against the Cowboys on Sept. 11. “They’re two of the best combo receivers out there in the league for sure,’’ Apple said. “Brandon Marshall is a big physical guy. Decker is a great route runner and is also pretty physical. They’re definitely going to help get us ready for the season.’’ This game could go a long way in determining who wins the starting middle linebacker job. Jasper Brinkley and Kelvin Sheppard are “neck and neck,’’ according to defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo. It is the only starting spot on defense still up for grabs. “It’s been a great battle,’’ Spagnuolo said. “Two guys that respect each other, and that’s what the league is all about. The more you can get that at every position the better you’re going to be.’’ Rookie S Darian Thompson (shoulder) is out, and Nat Berhe is the likely replacement as a starter alongside Landon Collins. The depth at safety is “in flux right now,’’ Spagnuolo said. Former Giants safety Antrel Rolle watched practice on Friday. This was a social visit. Rolle, 33, remains unsigned after he was released by the Bears.

Via The New York Times and Bloomberg, the feud is now extending to artists, with Spotify punishing artists who agree to have Apple Music exclusives by having their content less visible within the service. Spotify has outright told artists that their music won’t be displayed in playlists, and that they will “bury” songs in its search rankings if artists choose to have Apple Music exclusives. Spotify has reportedly been doing this for about a year. Spotify has been retaliating against musicians who introduce new material exclusively on rival Apple Music by making their songs harder to find, according to people familiar with the strategy. Artists who have given Apple exclusive access to new music have been told they won’t be able to get their tracks on featured playlists once the songs become available on Spotify, said the people, who declined to be identified discussing the steps. While it may not affect major artists, Bloomberg reports that Spotify is going after smaller artists who introduce their music on Beats 1 Radio with Zane Lowe. With the one year anniversary in June, Apple Music now has over 15 million subscribers, and will likely continue to grow, with the potential of dominating Spotify in the space. At the time of writing, Spotify currently has roughly twice as many subscribers as Apple Music. But, it is also worth noting that Spotify offers a free ad-based tier, which could hinder Spotify in the long term as the company struggles to make a profit.   Tags: Apple Music, Spotify About Peter Cao Peter has a passion for music and technology.

Now, Apple’s Korean counterpart is following suit with a “pink gold” Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge. That’s right — it’s not rose gold, though it looks an awfully lot like it. Samsung’s color variant for its flagship S7 and S7 Edge has been dubbed pink gold to distinguish itself from the rose gold trend. The color for the S7 pair isn’t new — the company announced the pink gold option back in April, except it was only available in select markets such as South Korea. Related: One man’s shiny new Samsung Galaxy Note 7 exploded while charging “Pink gold was chosen as it, like the other colors available for the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, is a natural color that provides a sense of comfort,” the company wrote in a blog post back in April. “These hues glitter and shimmer as if illuminated from inside their glass surfaces. In particular, the refined pink gold color scheme is intended to soothe and incorporate a touch of gentleness, radiance and sophistication to the smartphones’ design.” The color option is now available in the United States, if you fancy the need for a touch of gentleness and sophistication, but you’ll have to head over to Best Buy. The retailer has exclusive access to the color, and you’ll get a $150 Best Buy gift card if you purchase and activate a pink gold S7 or S7 Edge. Related: Let the games begin: Samsung unveils Galaxy S7 Edge Olympic Edition It’s unclear if the new Galaxy Note 7 will get the same pink gold treatment, but you’re now able to choose from black, gold, white, silver, and pink gold for the S7 and S7 Edge. Samsung also offered an Olympic Games edition of the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge exclusively through Best Buy, but the device was only available in limited quantities and cost an expensive $850. The S7 costs $670, while its Edge variant is priced at $770. Also watch: Share

This means that users will be able to load their passes onto their iPhones via the Wallet app and use them like you’d use a credit card with Apple Pay. The only difference here is that you’ll be using FeliCa (the standard of Japan’s mobile payment system) and not NFC. Apple Inc. is planning a new iPhone feature for Japan that will enable users to pay for mass-transit rides with their smartphones instead of physical payment cards. A future iPhone will include technology called FeliCa, a mobile tap-to-pay standard in Japan developed by Sony Corp., according to people familiar with the matter. The FeliCa chip will let customers in Japan store their public bus and train passes on their iPhones. Users would then be able to tap their phones against the entrance scanners instead of using physical cards. While the FeliCa chip is the standard technology underlying the service, there are several different providers of transit payment cards based on the type of transit and areas within Japan. So why build a feature into the iPhone only Japanese users will be able to take advantage of? Well, according to Bank of Japan, it’s pretty much because of big business. See, there’s apparently 1.9 million FeliCa terminals across Japan which were responsible for about $46 billion of transactions just last year alone. To put that in perspective, there’s around only 1.3 million NFC terminals in the US and just 320,000 in the UK. So obviously, rather just target a smaller market, it makes sense for Apple to jump on the bigger bandwagon. The Near Field Communication technology powering Apple’s mobile-payments service, Apple Pay, is prevalent in North America, Europe and Australia, but the FeliCa standard dominates Japan with a penetration of 1.9 million payment terminals, according to the Bank of Japan. The terminals handled 4.6 trillion yen ($46 billion) in transactions in 2015. Last year, there were 1.3 million NFC terminals in the U.S. and 320,000 in the U.K., according to research from Let’s Talk Payments and the U.K. Cards Association. According to Bloomberg, Apple plans to work with a bunch of card providers in Japan who support FeliCa payments. Apple intends to work with multiple transit card providers, one person said. The major players there include the Suica and Pasmo networks. Theoretically, virtual representations of the transit passes would be stored in the iPhone’s Wallet application, said the person, who asked not be identified because the planning is private. The card companies sell access to transit services both as-needed and via monthly packages. Don’t think you’ll only be able to pay at mass transits with this new feature, as Bloomberg reports that you’ll also be able to use the feature with a variety of other terminals that support FeliCa, including vending machines, convenience stores, and even for games on the Nintendo Wii U. Of course, this may be incorrect as it’s unclear whether Apple will make this type of payment exclusive to mass transit systems or not, however at least one major financial institution in Japan is currently in talks with the company to make the feature more widely available across multiple locations. At this point, it’s unclear whether Apple will launch the new payment feature in the next iPhone or the 2017 iPhone as the company is reportedly hoping that talks between partners go quickly so the technology can make its way into this year’s phone. However, if it’s the opposite, we’ll have to wait until September 2017 to see the feature make it’s way into an iPhone. Speaking of next year’s iPhone, within the same report by Bloomberg, Apple’s also rumored to be ditching the home button entirely. Apparently, the company will be going for a more simple, single-sheet-of-glass look for the front of the 2017 iPhone. This would be one of the biggest design changes of any iPhone in history. Apple is already at work on a major redesign of the iPhone for 2017 that focuses more heavily on the display by removing the Home button, according to a person familiar with the matter. The fait of the home button, at this point, is pretty unclear. Ideally, the company would have to make some type of external navigation method so users can navigate back to their home screens easier. Whether software navigation will be the name of the game here or not will depend on how Apple’s team reacts to trying to fill in the missing piece of the iPhone’s puzzle which, at this point, seems to be falling apart ever so slightly. This year’s iPhone is rumored to replace the home button with a Force Touch-enabled one that doubles as a Touch ID sensor. This may or may not happen this year, however it’s entirely possible we’ll see this feature make its way into next year’s iPhone. In fact, I’d lean toward this rather no home button at all next year since the rumor at hand is pretty sketchy with only one person “familiar with the matter” telling Bloomberg the news. Nevertheless, we’ll have more on both the FeliCa rumor and home button removal as we draw closer and closer to the launch of the 2016 iPhone and 2017 iPhone.

Just whip out your… Using public transportation? Just whip out your iPhone if you're in Japan By Lulu Chang — August 26, 2016 8:47 AM Subscribe Share cchana/Flickr Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends New Yorkers may still have to wait a bit longer to pay for their subway rides with their smartphones, but it looks like iPhone owners in Japan may be enjoying this feature sooner rather than later. According to a new report from Bloomberg, a “future iPhone” will feature FeliCa technology, which is a mobile tap-to-pay solution in Japan from Sony Corporation. This will let Japanese commuters store bus and train passes on their iPhones, and simply tap their devices against entrance scanners to gain access to public transportation. Comparable to the Near Field Communication (NFC) technology that’s used across North America, Europe, and Australia in Apple Pay, FeliCa is already ubiquitous across the island nation, with the Bank of Japan reporting 1.9 million of these payment terminals across the country, handling $46 billion worth of transactions last year. As for which transit card providers would be in on the deal, an Apple source said that the Cupertino-based gadget maker would be willing to work with multiple networks, including Suica and Pasmo. Ideally, these transit passes would live in the Apple Wallet app, and customers could choose to buy either monthly cards or pay-as-you-go. Related: ‘Brand New Subway’ challenges you to build a better NYC transit system While an Apple spokesperson has made no comment on these new reports, Bloomberg says the technology could be unveiled as early as September with the newest iPhone release. That said, a source noted that should talks with the Japanese payment networks require more time, the tap-to-pay transit feature could be withheld until next year. Japan represents quite the opportunity for Apple, with the tech-obsessed nation accounting for 8 percent of Apple’s total revenue, and nearly 11 percent of the company’s operating profit this past quarter. So get on top of things, New York MTA — transit cards may already be meeting their demise overseas, so we can’t possibly be that far behind, right? Also watch: Share

Most Popular Flickr randychiu By Eric Limer Aug 26, 2016 The iPhone 7 was finally announced and the rumors are true. No headphone jack here. Lightning port only. It'll be a bit of a change, one that will be annoying but survivable. But there's an even bigger (potential) design shift in store for the iPhone 8, or whatever Apple calls the 2017 edition of its smartphone. It's a change that's already in the works in the iPhone 7. In the future, rumors say, there will be no more Home button. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below That's a rumor worth getting excited about. Here's why. The rumor comes by way of Mark Gurman at Bloomberg, who is virtually infallible in matters of Apple, and it's one that just makes sense. Android devices gave up on physical buttons years ago. (For the most part. I'm looking at you, Samsung). For anyone who's never ventured outside of Apple-land, let me run down a few reasons why this is great. Most Popular First and foremost, moving the Home button onto the screen eliminates a huge point of failure for older phones. When an iPhone starts getting old, its Home button is often the first thing to fail. Apple even started up an official replacement program. This is not a huge surprise, since we're talking about a mechanical element that is the focus of a lot of wear and tear. You press it dozens of times every day. An iPhone is still usable with a broken Home button, but it requires a bunch of annoying workarounds by turning on accessibility features, and you lose the power of Touch ID. The iPhone just wasn't designed to work that way. A button-free iPhone could live a much longer life. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below This change isn't a rumor; it already happened. It's a small but important tweak that kind of slid under the radar amid all the talk of headphone jacks and AirPods. But instead of a physical, moving home button, the iPhone 7 has a Home Button that is, essentially, a touchscreen without the screen. By using the "3D Touch" tech it introduced in the iPhone 6s, Apple was able to make an unmoving Home Button that only triggers when you press it hard and on purpose. Better yet, Apple is using the haptic tech used in its Macbook touchpads to simulate the feeling of an actual click when you press down on it. A button-free iPhone could live a much longer life, but the real fun starts when you imagine what could happen when the Home button disappears entirely from sight just becomes a part of the screen. No dedicated space for a Home button—no friendly, ever-present circle at the bottom of the screen—can mean two good things at once: A bigger screen and a smaller phone. That might sound contradictory, but it's not, because phone size is not the same thing as screen size and you can shrink one while growing the other. The iPhone has a giant, physical Home button on the bottom, and it also has a big chunk of wasted space around the button. Go ahead, look at your iPhone right now. Worse, because Apple apparently likes design symmetry, there is a matching piece of non-screen at the top of the phone too. No Home button can mean two good things at once: A bigger screen and a smaller phone. The result is that, compared to Android devices, the iPhone has a very small screen for a phone that is as big as it is. This wasted space is not a technical necessity, just a design choice. Just take a look at this video that shows an iPhone 6 Plus and a Nexus 6 side-by-side: To be fair, these phones are not exactly the same size. The Nexus 6 is a little bit wider, but it also has a mammoth 6-inch screen compared to the iPhone's 5.5-inch. The Nexus 6's body is over 74 percent screen, whereas the iPhone 6 Plus is only 65 percent screen, meaning 35 percent of the space is just taking up room in your pocket and/or hand! No Home button would allow the iPhone 8 to get a bigger screen without actually getting bigger, or, to make the phone smaller without shrinking the screen at all. Or a little bit of both. Once the Home button is part of the screen, it doesn't have to be there all the time. It can disappear when you don't need it, which is how things work on Android phones. Are you watching a movie or a YouTube video? Playing a game? The on-screen buttons disappear until you summon them by touching the screen where they should be, giving you an extra bit of space for whatever you're watching. And what about Touch ID, the way you open your iPhone with your fingerprint? Apple already has a patent for reading fingerprints through an otherwise normal screen and has been buying up patents and tech from other companies. If Apple can get the tech to work, you won't need to tap the Home button because anywhere on the screen will work. A completely button-free iPhone isn't a certainty, and if it does happen it's at least a year out. But even though it's a big move away from the iPhone norm and the long tradition of a big friendly button, it would be a great and smart move for all iPhone's going forward.

  News Apple Google Microsoft iPhone 6 SE, Not 7 Geekbench Scores Are More Than The iPhone 6s By Talha Amjad  /  4 months ago Share Tweet Apple will be launching a new iPhone next month and although everyone thought that it would be the iPhone 7 that is not the case. Geekbench scores show that the upcoming iPhone is, in fact, the iPhone 6 SE, not the iPhone 7. So what we will be seeing next month could be the iPhone 6 SE and iPhone 6 SE Plus. If you are a but turned off by this news then you should know that the device scored higher than the iPhone 6 in Geekbench. A source in China seems to have gotten a prototype phone and was able to run the Geekbench benchmark on the device and you can see in the image below that the benchmark detects the phone as the iPhone 6 SE. The device is running iOS 10 as you would expect. iPhone 6 SE and iPhone 6 SE Plus do make sense if you think about it. Rumors suggest Apple won’t make any radical changes to the device and we know that whenever a new iPhone comes out the shape and design is changed dramatically. We also learned that it is possible that Apple is moving to a 3-year refresh cycle with the launch of this year’s iPhone. According to this strategy, Apple will stick to the same design for 3 years straight before it introduces a phone with dramatic enhancements. The iPhone 6s scored 4,427 points in the Geekbench multi-core test and 2,542 in the single-core test. So the iPhone 6 SE clearly has an improved chipset, since it managed to score 5,210 and 3,042, respectively. Past rumors pointed to the fact that the upcoming iPhone could have the A10 chips, so that could still be possible. The picture of the device shows that it still has a physical home button so the 3D touch home button might not be coming out this year. Although it seemed like a great feature to have on the iPhone.

Share Tweet Share Tags : iOS-iOS+ Apple-Apple+ A new report published today states that the combination of conservative ordering by Apple and issues obtaining enough parts, will result in a shortage of iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus handsets when the phone is launched next month. The waterproof speaker and the dual camera component are both said to be in short supply. Word of this component shortage comes out of Asia where Apple sources many of the parts used on its handsets. The reliable Nikkei Asian Review said that the shortage of components like the speaker and dual camera module are the results of low yields. The new iPhone models will be the first to offer a waterproof build. The Apple iPhone 7 Plus will be Apple's first handset to sport a dual camera setup. The issue with these two parts has yet to be completely solved, according to Yuanta Investment Consulting analyst Jeff Pu. Pu told clients that he is cutting his estimate of iPhone production (including all models) from July to December of this year to 114 million from his previous estimate of 120 million units. The analyst also expects Apple to build 74 million iPhone 7 units in the second half of this year, which would be a decline from the 84 million Apple iPhone 6s units built during the same time one year ago. That dovetails with an earlier report that Apple ordered 72 million to 78 million iPhone 7 units for this year. However, the Nikkei Asian Review says that Apple has ordered 15% fewer chipsets than the amount it ordered last year, while orders for panels are said to be down 20% year-over-year. Another major iPhone supplier received orders for only 54 million components for the new phones and a different supplier says that Apple has ordered parts conservatively this year. "If Apple sticks to its launch schedule from last year, there may not be enough supply at the beginning, as some suppliers are still trying to fix low yield rates of their components."-Industry source According to tipster Evan Blass, Apple will launch the 2016 iPhone models on September 16th. source: NikkeiAsianReview via BGR Editor's pick   PhoneArena Awards 2016   Apple AirPods review: the truly wireless earphones to beat Related phones PhoneArena rating: 9.3 Excellent User rating: 7.7 Good Apple iPhone 7 Specifications News[350] Rivals Size it Videos PhoneArena rating: 9.3 Excellent User rating: 8 Good Apple iPhone 7 Plus Specifications News[276] Rivals Size it Videos Related News   Report: Apple to cut iPhone production by 10% in the first quarter   Jet White iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus mockups appear in video   Best Buy meets AT&T’s free iPhone 7 deal, and raises it up to $900 in gift cards   Some iPhone 7 Plus users report camera issues, units are eventually being repaired or replaced   For the last 12 Days of Magenta contest, win the iPhone 7 from T-Mobile   Switch to AT&T and get BOGO deals on the iPhone 7, the LG G5 and the Galaxy S7 44 Comments Follow Following Options Close Always view all comments Show comments: default hide low rated show moderated comments Display mode: Threaded Chronological Newest first Save 1 2 Next » posted on 26 Aug 2016, 14:29 2 Reply 1.

So typical Apple, with a head start in excuses but not components. But in all seriousness, it is likely that internal Apple projections are probably low for the sales and so they ordered fewer components as stated in the article. The pro Apple press has likely added in the "component shortage" excuse to try to calm jittery investors and fanboys. I mean how can you have a component shortage while you are ordering conservatively? Also, waterproof speakers are in short supply? WHAT? The camera module is in short supply.....you mean the same one they've been using since last year (because it most likely is)? posted on 26 Aug 2016, 14:43 9 Reply 6. sgodsell (Posts: 3939; Member since: 16 Mar 2013) For devices that will have hardly any changes this year. So it makes sense for Apple to decrease it's numbers. Also they are being cautious since Apple has already seen two decreases in sales. This should be the kick in the pants that most companies would use to stir things up, but Apple lately has been resting on their Laurels. posted on 26 Aug 2016, 14:48 14 Reply 8. marorun (Posts: 3974; Member since: 30 Mar 2015) always same thing every year. make up excuse so they can overhype the phone and make it feel like if you dont preorder now its gonna take months to receive it. what a load of crap. posted on 26 Aug 2016, 16:15 1 Reply 25. PHYCLOPSH (Posts: 363; Member since: 28 Jun 2014) This is actually great news... For Apple! Since most of their consumers won't be buying the iPhone 7 anyway in lieu of the 8, Apple is actually saving itself the embarrassment of building too many of them - while at the same time they are further able to inflate price for the poor souls they're hoping to offload them to. posted on 26 Aug 2016, 21:46 0 Reply 40. bobby84 (Posts: 334; Member since: 13 May 2016) Unless they go to Samsung first and see what they've been missing im sure Everyone(Sony, HTC, One Plus, Samsung etc) will try to convert them over before the new release in 2017. posted on 27 Aug 2016, 12:06 0 in response to #40 in response to #40 Hide Reply 42.

AlikMalix (Posts: 6382; Member since: 16 Jul 2014) All of you trolls saying that Apple is making less phones to crate fake demand, how do you explain that Apple has prepped more phones for launch (by millions more) every concecutive year and still ended up selling out? It's not like they made couple thousand? As far as news went they ordered 70-80 million for the launch. All that even after it is projected that his year iPhones won't sell that well. You're a buncha irritating haters. Nothing more. posted on 26 Aug 2016, 15:32 9 Reply 18. sgodsell (Posts: 3939; Member since: 16 Mar 2013) Is the truth trolling. It's a known fact that sales for Apple has decreased in the last two quarters. Yet for the same two quarters Android sales have increased. From all the leaks it looks like Apple hasn't changed much since the iPhone 6s. A little more battery, a missing 3.5mm jack, a upgraded processor to push once again the lowest resolution flagship device at a flagship price. Yeah, okay Apple at its best once again more concerned about profits instead of giving the consumers the best tech. posted on 26 Aug 2016, 16:17 0 Reply 26. AlikMalix (Posts: 6382; Member since: 16 Jul 2014) I know the sales are lower this quarter. Did you read my post - it's the stupid notion that Apple specifically prepares less phones to hype demand when it's complete opposite - they prepare more phones by millions every next consecutive year - and still manage to sell out. They're not making less phones than before to create fake demand - they make more than last year and the demand is still stong with many still waiting or delayed after launch to get one. posted on 26 Aug 2016, 17:40 0 in response to #26 in response to #26 Hide Reply 29. Subie (Posts: 992; Member since: 01 Aug 2015) I agree with you Alik. The way I read the article is not that Apple deliberately ordered less, but that due to supplier issues there may be less available then Apple intended. In the end though most people that want one at launch will probably be able to find one for sale somewhere. posted on 26 Aug 2016, 18:33 0 in response to #26 in response to #26 Hide Reply 34. therealestmc (Posts: 364; Member since: 23 Jul 2012) And yet only two companies are making money, with Apple being on top. posted on 26 Aug 2016, 17:57 0 Reply 33. Deelron (Posts: 22; Member since: 22 Aug 2016) Android is not a phone vendor. All companies should be primarily concerned about profits (particularly long term), most notibly when two companies are taking nearly all of it. This article (shortage of components for new iPhone at release) appears every year, regardless of how great or merely good Apple is performing. posted on 26 Aug 2016, 15:07 6 Reply 14. kiko007 (Posts: 3368; Member since: 17 Feb 2016) Why the f**k are the same idiots the first to post on every Apple article? Seriously PA, I don't know what you call "moderation", but shouldn't you prioritize keeping the same troglodytes from flame baiting every article? I just want go read the article, scroll to the comments, and see an actual discussion about the phone. Not " Oh muh God......stupid sheeps r gonna buy it anyways!" posts from hipster jocks. It's high time you engaged in some actual disciplinary tactics rather than sitting ideally by trying to generate clicks. posted on 26 Aug 2016, 15:25 10 Reply 16. sgodsell (Posts: 3939; Member since: 16 Mar 2013) You act like you are hurt. Well get over it. Besides I have seen both you and AlikMalix be the first to post on Android articles with your negative posts towards Android or Google all the time. Also there is a lot of truth to what the vast majority have said so far. Especially when there is no denying the facts so far. Like the two previous quarter sales declines of iPhones. Yet in the same timeframe Android has seen an increase. Not to mention with all the leaks in regards to the new iPhones, not much is changing. So it makes sense for Apple to decrease their production. Does it not? Tim and friends should not be concerned with profits so much, and instead try to give the consumers the best tech instead. Clearly Apple hasn't been doing that. posted on 26 Aug 2016, 15:30 0 Reply 17. kiko007 (Posts: 3368; Member since: 17 Feb 2016) Uh-huh that's nice, now go back to your cell innmate #24478.......no one cares about your opinion. posted on 26 Aug 2016, 15:41 10 in response to #17 in response to #17 Hide Reply 21. sgodsell (Posts: 3939; Member since: 16 Mar 2013) Clearly you care enough to respond.

Apple is again rumoured to be on track to remove the iconic physical home button to its featured 2017 iPhone. iPhone Rumour has become key to every iPhone and iPad, instead of the button, fingerprint sensors would be built into the screen to allow the firms Touch ID system to work. Apple was reportedly working on a significant redesign of the iPhone for the 2017 model that will not include a home button as per the reports by Bloomberg. Removing the home button would be a crucial move for Apple to focus more on technologies like Touch ID and Apple Pay. Apple devices are failing more than Android Smartphones: Study It is internally developing Touch and Display Driver Integration (TDDI) single-chip solutions for its iPhone’s, according to the sources of Taiwan’s IC design industry. And they have come with the integrated fingerprint sensors. Next year’s model is expected to represent a significant redesign of iPhone which may be called the iPhone 8, will feature edge-to-edge flexible OLED display, top and bottom bezels. It also features fingerprint sensors and front-facing camera. The iPhone display may also feature edges that curved on both sides which are similar to Samsung Galaxy S7 edge, and also rumoured to have a glass body. It put a stop by moving away from the aluminium that has used for the previous iPhones since iPhone 5. Apple, Google, Microsoft and other tech companies team up against Anti-Robocall Strike Force The featured model reportedly coming in 2017 will mark the ten years since the original iPhone launched in 2007. The upcoming iPhone 7 will arrive with the 5.5-inch size with Apple 10 as the chipset and grouped with 2GB RAM. The rear camera of iPhone 7 upgraded with OIS (Optimal Image Stabilization) of 12MP camera. Apple iPhone 7 is going to launch on 16th September 2016 along with two more models iPhone 7 Plus and iPhone 7 Pro. The Pre-order sales are expected to start from 9th September 2016, so iPhone lovers get ready to grab the latest model of iPhone.

The latest image leak showcases a sketchy photoshopped case of the "iPhone 6 SE," which the source touts to be the rebranded iPhone 7.  ( Mac Rumors ) Advertisement A number of photos that claim to showcase the packaging of the upcoming iPhone surfaced recently, but the images scream "fake" from a mile away. Should the boxing details hold true, the next handset from Apple will be dubbed iPhone 6 SE instead of iPhone 7. The least edited variant of the photos comes via Weibo leaker KK, who mentions that he's sharing images that he got from other users. KK also notes that according to most sources, the upcoming smartphone from Apple will not be named iPhone 6 SE. Let's take a peek at the allegedly authentic photos. Looking at the rear of the box, it is easy to see that several lines of text were photoshopped. First off, it is blatant that "iPhone6 SE" diverges from Apple's traditional spacing, as the company never places the model number next to the "iPhone" text. Secondly, a close scrutiny of the crucial text shows big differences in font and background color, giving away the fact that some (poor) digital manipulation was in effect. The large block of text shows other signs of digital retouching, specifically a text line that contains the 2016 copyright date, as well as the line with the A1758 model number. The fact that different angles of the package show skewed typography for the iPhone 6 SE title goes to show that the name's blend of text and logos belong to a mashup of iPhone 6 and iPhone SE packaging. Interestingly enough, there is no front facing photo of the box. Despite the fact that everyone expects the iPhone 7 to resemble previous iterations, photoshopping redesigned antenna bands and a new flush Home Button are more challenging tasks. What is more, it is certain that Apple will deploy a new wallpaper for its latest smartphone, so that the box gets a distinctive look when viewed from the front. Rumors so far pointed out that the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will land as relatively unspectacular revamped editions to last year's iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. Very little visual revamping is in store, and some already appeared repeatedly in leaks and credible sources. These are the minimized antenna bands, a potential flush Home button and a larger dual-camera bump. We have been hearing about the axing of the 3.5 mm headphone jack, but we are taking it with a grain of salt until we see it officially launched. Until Apple's Sept. 7 event where the iPhone 7 (or 6 SE) will be showcased, it's mostly guesswork how the newest smartphone from the company will look like. Stay tuned to be the first to learn more details about its release! TAG Apple, iPhone 7, iPhone 6, iPhone SE © 2016 Tech Times, All rights reserved. Do not reproduce without permission.

Shares You may want to preorder the iPhone 7 way in advance, as a new report claims the upcoming iPhone's launch may be hindered by short supply. Apple is reportedly undergoing a shortage of materials following a batch of faulty components, an industry source told Japan's Nikkei Asian Review. The source adds that if Apple sticks to its typical fall release window, initial demand for the newest iPhone might potentially go unmet. In addition to a component shortage, the drop in demand for iPhones in general may have led to lowered yields from Apple's suppliers, 9to5Mac points out. Don't panic This isn't the first time an iPhone has been confronted with launch issues. The iPhone 4 hit a production snag before it released, and a dearth in supplies also affected the iPhone 5. Both of those devices wound up with slight hiccups fulfilling preorders on Day One, but thankfully never got close to "Nintendo Wii in 2006" levels of scarcity/chaos. So, unless you're the absolute earliest of early adopters, you probably shouldn't fret over whether you'll have a shiny new iPhone in time for this holiday.

Citing a person familiar with the matter, Bloomberg informed readers that Apple intends to redesign the 2017 iPhone, and its main focus is on the display, from which it will remove the Home button. Big plans for the 2017 iPhone Rumors in the past claimed that Apple is considering a complete overhaul for the iPhone it will release in 2017, which could be named the iPhone 8. The device is rumored to sport an edge-to-edge flexible OLED display and do away with the top and bottom bezels that house features such as the Touch ID fingerprint sensor and front-facing camera. Instead, the company might directly build the functionality of the Home button into the display, which will include Touch ID as well, reports Mac Rumors. It is said that Jony Ive, Apple’s design chief, had been nurturing a dream of building an iPhone that looks like a single sheet of glass and has chosen the tenth anniversary year of the iPhone (2017) to make his dream come true. The edges of the 2017 iPhone display could be curved on both sides just like those of the Samsung Galaxy S7. Rumors state that the device will have a glass body, instead of aluminum that has been an integral part of all the iPhones since the iPhone 5. The 2017 iPhone could have several other features as well, like facial recognition, an enhanced taptic engine, wireless charging and new biometric capabilities like iris scanning, reports Mac Rumors. Apple to foray into social media In 2017, Apple is also reportedly planning to step in the social media space. Not only will it expand social media sharing within its iOS suites but also build a service that will allow users to share images and videos just like Snapchat. With the app, users will be able to apply filters and record videos and send them to contacts or upload them for sharing on social platforms such as Facebook and Twitter, Bloomberg reported. Bloomberg claims that the design goals are one-hand use and that the complete process includes capturing, editing and uploading, all in less than a minute. The company is evaluating if it could introduce more social media sharing features for iOS and expand its adaptive assistance functionality, which makes suggestions to users based on location and time of day, the report stated.

A botched attempt to break into the iPhone of an Arab activist using hitherto unknown espionage software has trigged a global upgrade of Apple's mobile operating system, researchers said Thursday.

Both reports fingered the NSO Group, an Israeli company with a reputation for flying under the radar, as the author of the spyware. (AP Photo/Daniella Cheslow) Apple boosts iPhone security after Mideast spyware discovery RAPHAEL SATTER AND DANIELLA CHESLOW ASSOCIATED PRESS | August 25, 2016 PARIS — A botched attempt to break into the iPhone of an Arab activist using hitherto unknown espionage software has trigged a global upgrade of Apple's mobile operating system, researchers said Thursday. The spyware took advantage of three previously undisclosed weaknesses in Apple's mobile operating system to take complete control of iPhone devices, according to reports published Thursday by the San Francisco-based Lookout smartphone security company and internet watchdog group Citizen Lab. Both reports fingered the NSO Group, an Israeli company with a reputation for flying under the radar, as the author of the spyware. "The threat actor has never been caught before," said Mike Murray, a researcher with Lookout, describing the program as "the most sophisticated spyware package we have seen in the market." The reports issued by Lookout and Citizen Lab — based at the University of Toronto's Munk School of Global Affairs — outlined how an iPhone could be completely compromised with the tap of a finger, a trick so coveted in the world of cyberespionage that in November a spyware broker said it had paid a $1 million dollar bounty to programmers who'd found a way to do it. Such a compromise would give hackers full control over the phone, allowing them to eavesdrop on calls, harvest messages, activate cameras and microphones and drain the device of its personal data. Arie van Deursen, a professor of software engineering at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, said both reports were credible and disturbing. Forensics expert Jonathan Zdziarski described the malicious program as a "serious piece of spyware." Apple said in a statement that it fixed the vulnerability immediately after learning about it, but the security hole may have gone unpatched had it not been for the wariness of an embattled human rights activist in the United Arab Emirates. Ahmed Mansoor, a well-known human rights defender, first alerted Citizen Lab to the spyware after receiving an unusual text message on Aug. 10. Promising to reveal details about torture in the United Arab Emirates' prisons, the unknown sender included a suspicious-looking link at the bottom of the message. Mansoor wasn't convinced. Not only had he been imprisoned, beaten, robbed and had his passport confiscated by the authorities over the years, Mansoor had also repeatedly found himself in the crosshairs of electronic eavesdropping operations. In fact Mansoor already had the dubious distinction of having weathered attacks from two separate brands of commercial spyware. And when he shared the suspicious text with Citizen Lab researcher Bill Marczak, they realized he'd been targeted by a third. Marczak, who'd already been looking into the NSO Group, said he and fellow-researcher John Scott-Railton turned to Lookout for help picking apart the malicious program, a process which Murray compared to "defusing a bomb." "It is amazing the level they've gone through to avoid detection," he said of the software's makers. "They have a hair-trigger self-destruct." Working feverishly over a two-week period, the researchers found that Mansoor had been targeted by an unusually sophisticated piece of software which likely cost a small fortune to arm. "Ahmed Mansoor is a million-dollar human rights defender," Scott-Railton said. In a statement which stopped short of acknowledging that the spyware was its own, the NSO Group said its mission was to provide "authorized governments with technology that helps them combat terror and crime." The company said it had no knowledge of any particular incidents. It said it would not make any further comment.

The use of Israeli technology to police its own citizens is an uncomfortable strategy for an Arab country with no formal diplomatic ties to the Jewish state. And Israeli complicity in a cyberattack on an Arab dissident would seem to run counter to the country's self-description as a bastion of democracy in the Middle East. Authorities in both countries did not return calls seeking comment. Attorney Eitay Mack, who advocates for more transparency in Israeli arms exports, said his country's exports of surveillance software were not closely policed. "Surveillance is not considered a lethal weapon," Mack said. And Israeli regulations "don't take into consideration human rights or that it would be used by a government to oppress dissidents." He noted that Israeli Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has cultivated ties with Arab Gulf states. Netanyahu in 2014 urged Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to join him in the war on terrorism. "Israel is looking for allies," Mack said. "And when Israel finds allies, it does not ask too many questions." ___ This story has been corrected to show the accurate spelling of the researcher's surname is Murray, not Murrary. ___ Cheslow reported from Herzliya, Israel.

Users of platforms like Spotify, Tidal or Apple Music won’t be able to listen to the album until a month after its Sept. 9 release date. During a recent interview with Billboard, the singer revealed the reasons behind his decision. “A new album is just like anything else,” Aldean explained. “When the new iPhone comes out, when you go to the Apple Store, they’re not just handing them out for free. If you want something that’s brand new, you’re willing to pay the price for it. And then, after it’s been out for a while, you may get it at a discount. That’s just business 101.” This decision comes after Aldean was criticised by some fans for removing his highly successful Old Boots, New Dirt album from Spotify a month after its initial release. The album had broken the record for the most played country album during its first week of streaming. Old Boots, New Dirt was once again available to stream on Spotify on Nov. 5, 2015, over a year after it was initially pulled. “The last time around, I tried to do the right thing and it backfired and made me look like the bad guy; that was never my intention at all,” Aldean says. “It’s about the writers, publishers, producers, everybody is getting the short end of the stick on this deal. I have a lot of friends in this town who make their living writing.” So, will this decision to pull out of the ever-growing streaming environment hurt Aldean in the long run? Many country fans are still dedicated to buying physical CDs, but that may not be the case for long. recommended for you Music See Keith Urban’s Moving Tribute to Musicians We Lost in 2016 By Jeremy Burchard10 hours Lifestyle The ‘Fixer Upper’ Effect: Waco Among Most-Searched Zip Codes of 2016 By Kara Johnson12 hours Music William Michael Morgan and Runaway June’s Jennifer Wayne Announce Engagement By Jeremy Burchard12 hours Music Sam Hunt Releases Unannounced, Remorseful Song ‘Drinkin’ Too Much’ By Jeremy Burchard12 hours Trending Articles Music See Keith Urban’s Moving Tribute to Musicians We Lost in 2016 Lifestyle The ‘Fixer Upper’ Effect: Waco Among Most-Searched Zip Codes of 2016 Music William Michael Morgan and Runaway June’s Jennifer Wayne Announce Engagement Jason Aldean Fans Won’t Be Able to Stream His New Album © Copyright 2017 Wide Open Country categories News Music Entertainment Lifestyle Food & Drink Places COMPANY About Us Authors Careers Contact Policies Write For Us Follow us facebook twitter pinterest

(Photo : Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images for RPM & Eamonn McCormack/Getty Images) Advertisement Frank Ocean's Apple Music releases last week may have inadvertently affected Lady Gaga's future album release - in a negative way. Ocean released the visual album Endless as an Apple Music exclusive last Friday, his last album with Def Jam Recordings, a record label owned by Universal Music Group (The R&B singer had previously requested to be released from his contract, which was accepted). The singer then self-released another album, blond, last Saturday, only a day after the release of Endless. This was apparently a blindside for UMG, and caused chairman and CEO Lucian Grainge to cease all of its artists from exclusive deals, particularly with Apple Music. Now this is where Gaga comes in. There's a new report via Hits Daily Double that Gaga had been planning some type of Apple exclusive for her new music. "Is what happened last week between Frank Ocean, UMG and Apple game-changing? It certainly was for Universal, in that it triggered Lucian Grainge's mandating an end to all exclusives-notably including a deal that had been in place between Apple, Lady Gaga and Interscope," they report. Interscope is also owned by UMG, and if this report is true, Gaga may have to find an alternative route for releasing her highly anticipated fifth studio album. The pop star recently announced the title of the album's lead single as "Perfect Illusion". Gaga announced this on Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and her own website, with colorful banners revealing that the single will be released in September. The specific day in September is still not known. Unlike many of her contemporaries, Gaga has not taken part in exclusive streaming deals in the past, so it's possible at this point that we may just get a standard album release from the pop superstar. Nothing has been confirmed by Gaga, her team or UMG about a new plan for releasing her fifth album, which has been colloquially referred to as "LG5" by fans. © 2017 Enstarz, All rights reserved.

Spotify has announced that it now has 39 million paying subscribers - a figure made even more impressive when you take into consideration the ad-supported free tier it also offers. Just in March, Spotify reported that it had 30 million paying users and 100 million overall - it is now estimated the total number of users is around 125 million.  Apple Music, in comparison, had 15 million paying subscribers in June and was adding around one million a month - which means it should now have roughly 18 million paying users, less than half of Spotify’s. But then Apple Music launched only in June 2015 - Spotify has been active since 2008 (2009 in the UK).  The music streaming service market could be set to change further with the recent announcement from Universal Music Group that it is putting an end to supplying streaming exclusives following the release of Frank Ocean’s latest album Blonde. Ocean released Endless, his last contracted album with Def Jam Recordings, a subsidiary of UMG, as an Apple Music exclusive visual album. He then released his actual studio album the very next day, on his own label. Streaming exclusives are one of Apple Music’s biggest draws. If they disappear, the music-streaming service landscape could be blown wide open, with consumers potentially being able to choose any service yet get the same catalogue of music. Whether that works in Spotify’s favour remains to be seen.

Follow @labboudles Facebook Twitter Email Print Share Aug 26, 2016 1:52 PM EDT APPLE INC -0.91 At Closing, Dec 30th 115.82 USD Apple has hitched itself to music celebrities to pitch Apple Music, the $10-a-month digital service launched a year ago. There was the very public catering to Taylor Swift. Apple broke out its checkbook for exclusive rights to albums from Frank Ocean and Chance the Rapper. Trent Reznor from Nine Inch Nails and Dr. Dre are Apple executives now. Apple Music is so beyond cool it's frozen.   But to take Apple Music mainstream, Apple needs to cozy up not only to the hip musicians but also to the dull guys in suits who run the world's mobile phone companies. They won't get Tim Cook into hot parties, but the phone companies are crucial to Apple Music's future. In Europe and other parts of the globe, it has become common for carriers like Vodafone in the U.K. or Orange in France to pair phone plans with short-term discounted or free subscriptions to Spotify, Deezer or other streaming music services. Paying a monthly subscription is still a fairly novel way to buy music, and free or low-cost trial offers through mobile phone companies have become one of the biggest ways to sell people on the benefits of membership. Such music bundles represented more than one-fifth of global music subscribers in 2015, according to music industry analyst Mark Mulligan. You Can't Stop the Music Apple came late to music streaming but has been adding paying subscribers quickly Source: Company reports, MIDiA Research estimates Apple on its own offers three months free of Apple Music, but it hasn't really struck deals with phone carriers to promote Apple Music. Until now. Apple and BT Group's EE, the biggest mobile phone carrier in the U.K., are teaming up to give EE customers six months of Apple Music free. The deal has the potential to double the subscriber count for Apple Music if EE's 14 million 4G wireless customers are added to Apple Music's existing 15 million paying subscribers. Apple from the earliest days of the iPhone has had rocky relationships with mobile carriers. Almost on principle, Apple thought they didn't care about consumers and Apple did. But right now, Apple really, really believes in the principle that Apple Music should be huge. Steve Jobs and Apple dismissed streaming music until the rise of companies like Spotify and Pandora proved people were happy to listen to music online without paying for iTunes downloads. Apple wants Apple Music to succeed to continue the company's heritage on the music vanguard and to keep people buying iPhones. The company should strike even more EE-like deals with its friends/antagonists in the mobile phone business to ensure Apple Music catches on. Vinyls to Streams The revenue mix of the music industry is shifting to digital formats such as downloads and streams Source: IFPI, a trade association for the international recording industry There are always perils of leaning too hard on phone companies to market an app or digital feature. People who receive a free service might not want it or be unwilling to pay for it. Or the phone company will lose interest in the promotions and stop pushing them aggressively. The symbol for this danger is French music subscription service Deezer, which was seriously wounded by a partnership with Orange it used to increase subscribers quickly. When Deezer was trying to go public last year, the company disclosed that 53 percent of its 6.3 million subscribers were "inactive bundle subscribers" -- meaning they had received the service as part of their mobile phone plans but hadn't actually used it. Those 3.34 million zombie subscribers generated some revenue from Orange's undisclosed fee to Deezer. But they weren't paying full price for their subscriptions and they weren't likely to keep paying their monthly bills for long.  Deezer's experience shows that it isn't difficult to get people to try streaming music subscriptions. The key is doing the right things to make them stick around once their monthly cost goes from zero to $10 a month. The payoff can be huge. A person familiar with Spotify's business said it was putting a lot of effort into teaching new subscribers how to use the service and had converted more than 70 percent of people on telecom offers to paid subscriptions.  Apple could avoid Deezer's zombie problem, but it needs to coddle new subscribers more than it does now. When Shira received a free three-month subscription to Apple Music last year, she received only two emails from Apple -- one welcoming her as a new subscriber and another three months later asking her to set her iPhone to automatically charge her credit card once the free subscription ended. She didn't.  Apple has spent a small fortune to make Apple Music appealing with exclusive music deals and payouts to artists. To make Apple Music mainstream, though, it needs span the globe to get its service on as many people's phones as possible and do much more to make sure they stick around once the free ride ends.  This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners. Apple previously offered free 12-month Apple Music memberships to customers of Telstra, the Australian phone carrier. This was a relatively small deal, and the EE deal is a much more ambitious effort with a mobile phone carrier.  EE is already marketing its new arrangement with Apple Music in an ad featuring Kevin Bacon and Britney Spears. The ad seems to be restricted to viewing in the U.K., but trust us, it will make you feel embarrassed for Kevin Bacon.  To contact the authors of this story: Shira Ovide in New York at sovide@bloomberg.net Leila Abboud in Paris at labboud@bloomberg.net To contact the editor responsible for this story: Daniel Niemi at dniemi1@bloomberg.net Evergrande outstanding bonds $12.5 billion The Feeling's Mutual China's Own Mr. Trump Real Estate Christopher Langner Combined Market Cap of the Fab Five $2.4 trillion Rewind The Year in Technology: 2016 in Charts Tech Shira Ovide Number of Mid-to-Late-Stage Allergan R&D Projects 70 Betting the Pharm Brent Saunders's New Model Will Be Tested in 2017 Health Max Nisen On the Rise On the Rise U.S. Treasury yields have been rising in the past few months on higher inflation expectations Source: Bloomberg Cashing out Beware the Foreign Exodus From Treasuries Markets Lisa Abramowicz Megasize Me Megasize Me Acquirers announced around 35 large takeovers in 2016, compared with more than 50 last year Source: Bloomberg 2017 Outlook M&A in the Trump Era: Huge?

New EE post-paid contracts and renewals will come with six free months of Apple Music starting Sept. 1, Marc Allera, Chief Executive Officer of EE, said in an interview, without disclosing what the network will pay Apple for the service.   He said the churn rate of customers switching away from EE "has been improving," currently standing at 1 percent. "Offerings like this will help lower churn further," Allera said. It’s the second time Apple has licensed its music content to a mobile provider that would then give it away for free, following a similar pact that it signed last year with Australian mobile provider Telstra Corp., Allera said. EE and other U.K. telecoms providers hope to attract customers from one another with new content offerings. This spring, EE began giving its users sports content licensed by its parent company, BT. The move was seen as a response to a deal between rival network provider Telefonica SA and Sky Plc. Under that deal, Champions League and Formula 1 content from Sky was pushed out to Telefonica’s O2’s network in the U.K. Exclusive insights on technology around the world.

Giving just a portion of those users access to Apple’s music streaming service -- if only temporarily -- could help close some of the gap between Apple’s subscriber base and that of Stockholm-based music streaming service Spotify Ltd., which has 39 million paid subscribers according to a recent Billboard report. Deutsche Telekom AG’s T-Mobile division is expected to announce a similar deal with Apple in September, according to German media. Allera said EE would continue to buy content, rather than make its own. "The approach we are taking is to work with partners to create these services, not create them ourselves," Allera said. "Operators have tried to create their own portals to take customers away from services they were using. That didn’t work." Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

In a deal that mirrors Vodafone's tie-up with Spotify, the offer will be available to both iOS and Android customers who are either starting a new contract or upgrading. Users will get full access to Apple's music service, without the need to send Apple a tenner a month for the privilege. This includes the huge library of tracks, the custom playlists, and the Beats 1 radio station that you'll never listen to. The news follows soon after EE launched another tie-in - free BT Sport on mobile devices, courtesy of its new corporate master BT. EE is the first British network to forge a content deal like this Apple, but this could be a sign of a broader trend: As mobile networks fight to differentiate themselves from competitors, special offers in conjunction with content providers is a straightforward way to do it. Similarly, it could be good for customer retention: Sure, you might want to quit your network, but what if that meant you also had to start paying for your music? To promote the new offer, EE has made yet another TV advert with Kevin Bacon. We pray that one day he will manage to destroy whatever dirt it is that EE has on him.

X EU to rule against Ireland in Apple tax case Tax deal found to be illegal state aid but Apple’s tax bill to Ireland will be far less than originally suggested Fri, Aug 26, 2016, 20:39 Cliff Taylor Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO and Taoiseach Enda Kenny meet at at Apple’s campus in Cork, Ireland in 2014. The EU Commission is preparing to issue a final ruling that Ireland’s tax deal with Apple represented illegal state aid.         The EU Commission is preparing to issue a final ruling that Ireland’s tax deal with Apple represented illegal state aid. However sources believe the amount of tax Ireland will be asked to collect from the US giant will be much less than the billions of euro which had been originally suggested by some analysts. Court challenge The Government and Apple will immediately signal that they will challenge the ruling in the European courts, a process that could take some years. Sources say that government and the US company remain in “lock step” on the issue. When the EU Commission issued its preliminary adverse finding in 2014, which was that it believed that the Irish government had given Apple illegal state aid, some estimates were that it would seek to oblige Ireland to collect as much as €18 billion to €19 billion in taxes dating backing to the 1990s. EU to rule Apple owes State billions in back tax EU to find Apple owes Ireland billions in back taxes Q&A: What exactly is at stake in the Apple tax issue? Smaller sum Sources now believe the likely outcome will involve a much smaller sum. While the precise terms of the EU Commission decision - and whether it will mention an actual figure - remain unclear, sources believe that the sum involved is likely to be in the hundreds of millions rather than the billions. One suggestion is that Ireland could be pressed to recoup somewhere between €500 million and €1 billion from Apple. However the final terms of the commission decision are not yet fully clear. While this amount of money would not be significant for Apple, both it and the Irish government are believed certain to appeal any ruling. Both Apple and the Government have denied any wrongdoing. Earlier this year the EU Competition Commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, told the Minister for Finance, Michael Noonan, that the decision could come in September or October. Sources now believe it may emerge late next week or early the following week. ADVERTISEMENT White paper The Apple case has become a highly controversial issue between the EU Commission and Washington. Earlier this week, the US Treasury published a White Paper arguing that the EU Commission was exceeding its powers in its tax investigations. In what was seen as a clear reference to the Apple case, it also made a strong argument that the EU Commission should not seek to recoup back tax dating back years from the companies involved. Apple is just one of a number of companies whose tax affairs the Commission is investigating, but it is by far the most high profile of the cases involved. An adverse ruling is likely to heighten tensions between Brussels and Washington. The white paper suggested that the treasury was considering retaliatory measures, and also that the tax disputes could have a “chilling” impact on any trans-Atlantic investment. The Irish government has repeatedly insisted that Apple did not get any “special” date, but the low level of tax paid by Apple of profits moved through Ireland - often 2 per cent or less - has proved highly controversial.       Read More Apple could face major Irish tax bill after EU ruling Ireland risks being trampled in US/EU corporate tax fight Ireland set for damage limitation over EU decision on Apple tax Business week: crunch time for Apple, the EU and US US steps up pressure on EU ahead of Apple’s Irish tax ruling Cliff Taylor: US sets down big marker in European tax battle Joseph Stiglitz attacks Apple’s Irish tax regime Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Transport & Tourism Why Ryanair is offering package holidays now Work Millennials start new year with old-school paper diaries and pens English Soccer Jermain Defoe double leaves Liverpool frustrated Irish Times After 2016, economic forecasting for 2017 has got to be perilous Sponsored Making a difficult fertility journey a lot less lonely Redbreast Lustau: an old friend with a new whiskey perspective Infertility and the workplace: one woman's experience Do you know how much you’ll save by switching health plan?

Getty Images Advertisement SAN FRANCISCO—Apple iPhone owners on Friday were urged to install a quickly released security update after a sophisticated attack on an Emirati dissident exposed vulnerabilities targeted by cyber arms dealers. Researchers at Lookout mobile security firm and Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto said they uncovered a fierce, three-pronged cyber attack targeting a dissident's iPhone "that subverts even Apple's strong security environment." Lookout and Citizen Lab worked with Apple on an iOS patch to defend against what was called "Trident" because of its triad of attack methods, the researchers said in a joint blog post. "We were made aware of this vulnerability and immediately fixed it with iOS 9.3.5," Apple said in a released statement. Trident is used in spyware referred to as Pegasus, which a Citizen Lab investigation showed was made by an Israel-based organization called NSO Group. It was acquired by the US firm Francisco Partners Management six years ago, according to Lookout and Citizen. Related Apple, GM Join White House Initiative to Address Gender Pay Gap Cyberthreats Targeting the Factory Floor Lookout referred to Pegasus as the most sophisticated attack it has seen, sneakily accessing calls, cameras, email, passwords, apps and more on iPhones. The spyware was detected when used against Ahmed Mansoor, a human rights activist in the United Arab Emirates, who has been repeatedly targeted using spyware. Phishing Scheme After receiving a suspicious text with a link, he reported the matter to Citizen Lab, which worked in conjunction with San Francisco-based Lookout to research the affair. "The attack sequence, boiled down, is a classic phishing scheme: send text message, open web browser, load page, exploit vulnerabilities, install persistent software to gather information," the joint blog post said. "This, however, happens invisibly and silently, such that victims do not know they’ve been compromised." Mansoor received text messages on August 10 and 11 promising that secrets about detainees being tortured in UAE jails could be accessed by clicking on an enclosed link, researchers said. Had he fallen for the ruse, the Trident chain of "zero-day exploits" would have broken into his iPhone and installed snooping software. Once infected, Mansoor's iPhone would have been turned into a "spy in his pocket" capable of tracking his whereabouts and conversations, Citizen Lab said. Mansoor was targeted five years ago with FinFisher spyware and again the following year with Hacking Team spyware, according to Citizen Lab research. "The use of such expensive tools against Mansoor shows the lengths that governments are willing to go to target activists," the researchers said. Although the cyber attack on Mansoor was not linked to a specific government, Citizen Lab said indicators pointed to the UAE. UAE authorities did not comment on the matter. Lookout and Citizen believe the spyware has been "in the wild for a significant amount of time." "It is also being used to attack high-value targets for multiple purposes, including high-level corporate espionage on iOS, Android and Blackberry." Citizen Lab has also found evidence that "state-sponsored actors" used NSO weapons against a Mexican journalist who reported on high-level corruption in that country and on an unknown target in Kenya. The NSO tactics included impersonating sites such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, the British government's visa application processing website, and a wide range of news organizations and major technology companies, the researchers said. Cyber Arms Dealers Mansoor's decision to enlist Citizen Lab instead of falling into the trap gave researchers a rare chance to expose the work of "shady cyber arms dealers" who command high prices for morally questionable services, Lookout vice president of security research Mike Murray told AFP. Invoices posted online have shown that hackers can charge tens of thousands of dollars per target hit with their software. "The smartphone is a valuable target, and breaking into it is a valuable skill set," Murray said. "People who can do this, and with wiggle room in their moral code, have realized the business opportunity." NSO Group has been around since 2010 and the capture of one of its weapons was billed as a first. Studying Trident has helped cyber defenders find ways to spot spyware that had been operating unseen, and they are "actively catching it in the wild now," Murray said. He declined to reveal anything about other targets, saying that they were people likely to be under surveillance in other ways by local authorities. Citizen Lab saw the attack on Mansoor as further evidence that "lawful intercept" spyware has significant abuse potential, and that some governments can't resist the temptation to use such tools against political opponents, journalists and human rights defenders.

But it still can’t offer you the kind of gaming experience you expect from a computer, and the same goes for virtual reality. Apple might be exploring VR right now, and it’s likely that future MacBook Pros will have better graphic cards so they can handle more complex programs and games. But any existing MacBooks won’t be eligible for upgrades – after all, these are laptops. To fix that, one company has come up with a device that aims to give any laptop, including MacBooks, a huge boost: Meet the Wolfe. DON’T MISS: Apple’s new iPhone 7 is going to be SO much better than any Android phone… We’re looking at an external enclosure that can house the latest GPU models and offer MacBook owners a massive graphics performance upgrade. If the project sounds familiar, that’s because RAZR came out with a similar product earlier this year, but that one isn’t compatible with Apple’s laptops yet. This is a Kickstarter operation, the Wolfe is still a risky proposition, mainly because backers will have to wait several months to actually get the product — if it goes into production at all. Not to mention that Apple’s way of doing things could always hinder the device's functionality. One exciting thing Apple could do to fix the same MacBook Pro issue is to launch an updated Thunderbolt Display that includes a GPU slot. That said, the Wolfe can be backed for $449 on Kickstarter right now, as lower-tier pledges aren’t available any longer. The devices are supposed to begin shipping in February or March next year if everything goes according to plan. The project reached its $50,000 funding goal in less than a day, and has almost a month to go – currently, more than 550 backers have pledged over $200,000 for the Wolfe.

Jean-François Bérubé / PNG Share Adjust Comment Print “They ate by candlelight, the candles of all shapes and sizes flickering around the kitchen. Their plates were piled high with turkey and chestnut stuffing, candied yams and potatoes, peas and gravy. They’d all brought something to eat, except Ben, who didn’t cook. But he’d brought bottles of wine, which was even better …” (From 2005’s Still Life, by Louise Penny.) In Three Pines, the table is set. For dinner, of course, but also for murder. Through her 11 mystery novels featuring Chief Inspector Armand Gamache, Louise Penny has made Quebecois food as crucial an ingredient as the clues scattered about like brioche crumbs. Cover of A Great Reckoning by Louise Penny. PNG Now, as we wait for book 12, A Great Reckoning (Minotaur), to be released on Aug. 30, Penny has gathered recipes for dishes mentioned in each of the books into an e-cookbook called The Nature of the Feast: Recipes from the World of Three Pines. (Download the recipes at gamacheseries.com) “I wanted you to feel what it’s like to live in Québec,” she writes in The Nature of the Feast. “And to do that I needed to make the books sensuous, to engage all your senses. So that you smell the musky wood smoke and feel the scrape of the cold against your cheeks. You hear the rustle of the leaves and see with clarity the village green. And you taste the food. That glorious Québécois cuisine.” There is nothing like food to — quite literally — evoke the flavour of a place, not to mention the essence of a character. When Clara and Peter Morrow hold a potluck feast in their Three Pines home, it demonstrates that they are beloved by their community, but as struggling artists are too poor to pay for the meal. It sums up the generosity of their friends — and hides the duplicitous nature of one of them. It’s also a welcome pause before the next twist in the novel’s plot. Plus it just makes for delicious reading. Of course, Penny isn’t the only crime writer who cares about croissants as well as clues. There’s Martin Walker, whose Bruno Chief of Police spends as much time wooing women with his homemade pâté de foie gras as he does fighting crime in the Dordogne. You can find recipes for dishes like truffle soufflé on his website, brunochiefofpolice.com. Or just read the books — Bruno delights in explaining just how to cook his favourite foods. Similarly, Donna Leon’s Commissario Guido Brunetti escapes from the crime and corruption of Venice to enjoy leisurely multi-course lunches at home with his wife Paola. Back in 2010, Leon’s best friend Roberta Pianaro published some of the detective’s favourite dishes in Brunetti’s Cookbook, including pumpkin ravioli, roasted artichokes, baked branzino and pork ragu with porcini. Anne Zouroudi’s Greek island mysteries, too, are all about food and what it means in a small community. She describes her investigator, Hermes Diaktoros, as an “occasional gourmand,” and writes, “He allows me to promote unashamedly what I love about Greek cuisine.” Then there are the myriad series where the chief detective is more at home in the kitchen than a squad car: Diane Mott Davidson’s books featuring caterer Goldy Schulze, for instance, or Joanne Fluke’s baker Hanna Swensen. The culinary crime novel may seem like a new trend, but in truth food has been served with crime ever since the first mystery novels appeared in the mid-19th century; even that famously ascetic Victorian detective Sherlock Holmes fully enjoyed his chicken curries and foie gras. The genre’s popularity grew alongside a burgeoning and anxious middle class. As the Industrial Revolution elevated the lower classes into the ranks of the well-to-do, status was implied by what a newly rich family ate and, just as importantly, who was preparing it. The fear of what a resentful servant could do to that game pie or Victoria sponge went hand in trembling hand with the fear of losing that new-found status. Murder mysteries proved to be a comforting way to channel that fear. By the 1920s and ’30s, the so-called golden age of the mystery novel, Agatha Christie was using food to draw subtle social lines — and to bump off more than a few hapless victims. She and her contemporary Dorothy Sayers taught us all about the marzipanlike scent of cyanide and the best way to introduce arsenic into a dessert omelette. But food was always more of an amuse bouche in these early novels, rather than the main course. It took two expansive gourmands, both born in the hungry 1930s, to really make a meal out of fine dining: George Simenon’s detective Jules Maigret, whose wife was a haute cuisine chef, and Rex Stout’s Nero Wolfe. Indeed, in 1973, well ahead of the current trend, Stout published a book of his detective’s favourite recipes, most of them drowning in butter and cream. And now we have The Nature of the Feast. In her novels, Penny explores themes of betrayal doled out by our nearest and dearest, and the good will found at the tables of strangers who become friends. There is no better way, in the world of Three Pines, to demonstrate kindness or cruelty than by sharing a meal. So, pass the croissants, but watch out for that deadly butter knife. Apple and Avocado Salsa from The Nature of the Feast by Louise Penny. PNG Apple and Avocado Salsa with Honey-Lime Dressing Recipe from The Nature of the Feast by Louise Penny (Macmillan). Mentioned in The Nature of the Beast: “Their dinner guests had already arrived and were sipping drinks and eating apple and avocado salsa by the time Armand returned.” Finely grated zest and juice of 1 lime 1 tsp (5 mL) light honey ½ tsp (2 mL) sea salt ¼ tsp (1 mL) freshly ground black pepper 1 Hass avocado, peeled, pitted, and cut into ½-inch (1-cm) dice 1/2 red apple, peeled, seeded, and cut into ½-inch (1-cm) dice 1 tbsp (15 mL) finely chopped fresh cilantro (optional) Chips of choice Put the lime zest and juice into a bowl. Whisk in the honey, salt and pepper. Fold in the avocado and apple until coated with the dressing. Add the cilantro, if using. Taste and add a pinch more of salt and pepper, if needed. Spoon the salsa onto the chips. The salsa is best eaten when freshly made, but can be stored in the refrigerator for up to a few hours. If refrigerating, gently press a sheet of plastic wrap directly on the top of the salsa, then cover the container. Bring the salsa to room temperature about 15 minutes before serving. Makes about 1½ cups salsa (375 mL) Note: Choose a slightly firmer (but still ripe) avocado than you would for guacamole and a naturally soft red apple such as a McIntosh. The quantities above can easily be doubled to serve a larger crowd. French Onion Soup from The Nature of the Feast by Louise Penny. PNG French Onion Soup Recipe from The Nature of the Feast by Louise Penny (Macmillan). Mentioned in Bury Your Dead: “A bubbling French onion soup sat in front of Émile and Gamache was given a hot bowl of pea soup. ‘I met a fellow this morning who’s training for the race,’ said Gamache. ‘Bet he’s in good shape,’ said Émile, lifting his spoon almost over his head, trying to get the stringy, melted cheese to break.” 4 tbsp (60 mL) unsalted butter 2 lb (1 kg) yellow onions (about 5 medium onions), peeled and sliced ½ inch (0.5 cm) thick 2 tbsp (30 mL) all-purpose flour 1/3 cup (80 mL) white wine or 3 tbsp (45 mL) dry sherry 3 cups (750 mL) beef or chicken broth, preferably homemade Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste Half a French baguette, cut into 1/2-inch (1 cm) slices Olive oil 1 cup (250 mL) grated Gruyére cheese Heat the butter in a medium (4-quart/4-litre) heavy-bottomed pot over low heat until bubbling. Add the onions and cook, stirring often, until very well browned, about 45 minutes. Add the flour and cook, stirring, for 4 minutes. Add the wine or sherry and cook, stirring, until almost evaporated. Add the broth, bring to a boil, and adjust the heat so the soup is barely simmering. Season with salt and pepper. Cover the pot and cook until the onions are very tender, about 15 minutes. While the soup is simmering, make the toasts Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Lightly brush both sides of each slice of bread with olive oil. Arrange the bread on a baking sheet and bake until golden brown and crisp, about 12 minutes. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool. Position the oven rack about 8 inches (20 cm) from the broiler and preheat the broiler. Ladle the soup into two ovenproof crocks. Cover the top of the soup with a layer of toasts, then spread a layer of the cheese over the toasts. Place the crocks on a baking sheet and broil until the cheese is golden brown and bubbly, about 5 minutes. Let the crocks sit for a few minutes before serving, handling them carefully. Note: If you don’t have ovenproof crocks, make the cheese toasts and float them on top of the soup: Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or aluminum foil. Make the toasts as described above and line them up on the sheet. Top with the grated Gruyére. Bake until the cheese is golden brown and the toasts are very crisp, about 12 minutes. Ladle the hot soup into bowls and top with the cheese toasts. Makes about 4 cups (1L), enough for two main-course serving or four first-course servings. Chocolate and Raspberry Mousse Recipe from The Nature of the Feast by Louise Penny (Macmillan). Mentioned in The Long Way Home: “Armand Gamache looked down at his plate. Empty. All the wonderful food gone. He was sure it must have been delicious, but he couldn’t remember eating a single bite. After a dessert of raspberry and chocolate mousse they went home.” 10 oz (280 g) good-quality semi-sweet or extra bittersweet (about 70 per cent cocoa) chocolate 2 tbsp (30 mL) unsalted butter 4 large eggs, separated (see note) 1 cup (250 mL) heavy cream, very cold 1 tbsp (15 mL) raspberry liqueur, such as Chambord, or 1 tsp (5 mL) pure vanilla extract Additional whipped cream (optional) One ½-pint basket fresh raspberries Break up or chop the chocolate into small chunks. Melt the chocolate and butter in the top of a regular or improvised double boiler: Set a heatproof bowl into a saucepan; the size of the bowl should be large enough to easily hold the chocolate, fit the top of the saucepan, and keep the bottom of the bowl at least 2 to 3 inches (5 to 8 cm) above the water). Stir occasionally until the chocolate has completely melted, about 10 minutes. Keep the water at a bare simmer. Remove the chocolate mixture from the heat and beat in the egg yolks, one at a time. Beat the egg whites in a separate bowl with an electric mixer just until they hold soft peaks. Fold the egg whites into the chocolate mixture, one-half at a time, using a rubber spatula. Fold gently, making sure to scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl. Stop folding when the whites have been halfway incorporated into the chocolate. Whip the heavy cream with an electric mixer just until it holds soft peaks. Add the liqueur to the chocolate mixture. Fold in about three-quarters of the whipped cream just until no white streaks remain. Set 12 raspberries aside. Mash the remaining berries into the reserved whipped cream until the cream takes on a light pink colour. Spoon about ⅓ cup (80 mL) chocolate mousse into a champagne flute or other tall, clear glass (a white ramekin will work in a pinch). Spoon in a tablespoon or so of the raspberry cream, and then top up the glass (or ramekin) with another ⅓ cup (80 mL) of mousse. Cover each serving with a small piece of plastic wrap and refrigerate until completely set, at least 3 hours or up to 1 day. Serve with additional whipped cream, if you like, and a couple of the reserved fresh berries. Note: Eating raw eggs may lead to food-borne illness. You can reduce the risk of illness by washing the eggshells before cracking them. In any case, pregnant women and those with compromised immune systems should refrain from eating raw eggs Makes 6 servings Anthony Gismondi: It’s the juice that counts, not the packaging MasterChef star Graham Elliot riffs on food and music Comments We encourage all readers to share their views on our articles and blog posts.

Click Apple Should Buy Sirius XM Satellite Radio, CNBC's Jim Cramer Says Jim Cramer, host of CNBC's "Mad Money," on Friday said Apple should buy satellite radio operator Sirius XM. (Virginia Sherwood/CNBC) PATRICK SEITZ 8/26/2016 Reprints It's become a favorite parlor game of Wall Street analysts and tech journalists: Speculating what acquisitions Apple (AAPL) could make with its giant stockpile of cash. Jim Cramer, host of CNBC's "Mad Money," offered his two cents on the subject on Friday. He said Apple should buy satellite radio operator Sirius XM Holdings (SIRI) to bolster its fast-growing services business. Sirius would strengthen Apple's position in the subscription-based music business, where it has a foothold with its Apple Music streaming service. Sirius also would give Apple a major presence in the automotive infotainment sector, Cramer said. "Anything that puts Apple on the path toward owning the automobile would really brighten the company's long-term outlook," Cramer said. Maybe Cramer just likes the fact that Sirius XM's ticker symbol, SIRI, is the same as Apple's popular voice-response personal assistant. Apple ended the June quarter with $231.5 billion in cash and securities. IBD'S TAKE: While Apple has an enormous hoard of cash and securities, it ranks No. 5 in cash alone, according to a research report. Check out the IBD article "Microsoft, Alphabet Top Cash-On-Hand Field; Apple Dominates Overall." "Every six months, Apple spends the equivalent of Sirius XM's entire market cap on buying back its own stock, and they have got more than $230 billion just lying around," Cramer said. Sirius has a market cap of about $20 billion. Major acquisitions are out of character for Apple, which prefers to make smaller, under-the-radar purchases of companies with interesting technology and/or technically skilled personnel. For instance, this month Apple acquired artificial intelligence startup Turi for about $200 million, Bloomberg reported. And on Monday, Fast Company reported that Apple purchased Silicon Valley-based personal health data startup Gliimpse. Apple CEO Tim Cook reiterated the company's acquisition strategy on July 26 conference call to discuss fiscal third-quarter earnings. "We're constantly looking on the outside for great talent and great intellectual property," he said. "We have been buying companies on average every three to four weeks or so." Apple's largest acquisition was its $3 billion purchase of Beats Electronics and Beats Music in August 2014. In late June, Apple was rumored to be interested in buying rival streaming music service Tidal. Outspoken rapper Kanye West went on a Twitter (TWTR) rant in July where he tried to goad Cook into buying Tidal, purportedly for the sake of music fans. West is believed to have a stake in Tidal. In the past year, pundits have predicted Apple would buy Tesla Motors (TSLA), GoPro (GPRO) or possibly a movie studio. Apple stock fell 0.6% to 106.94 on the stock market today. Sirius XM stock climbed a fraction to 4.16.

According to inside sources, musicians who release new material exclusively on Apple Music have been told that their tracks will not be included on featured playlists, and are finding their songs buried in Spotify search results. The practice of doing this has apparently been ongoing for about a year, but some sources suggest that Spotify’s efforts have escalated over the past few months. Further, the practice doesn’t seem to be restricted to Apple Music; artists who have done exclusive releases on Tidal have also been retaliated against, according to sources. Update: In regard to Spotify burying search results, a Spotify spokesperson has reached out to us with the statement that “This is unequivocally false.” While the report notes that Spotify’s actions may not be affecting major artists like Drake and Frank Ocean, the company has specifically threatened to use its retaliatory practices on smaller artists who choose to introduce new music via Apple’s Beats 1 radio service. At least one industry representative indicates that their client has cancelled plans to debut a song on Beats 1 in fear that they might lose promotion from Spotify, although the agent and artist asked to not be identified to avoid damaging their relationships with the streaming companies. Spotify has taken a stand against exclusive deals in the past, saying their harmful to the music business; although the company has also pursued exclusive deals itself, it has had limited success due to its refusal limit releases to only the service’s paid tier.

But what exactly is a Touch Disease, and how worried should you be about your beloved smartphone turning into an expensive glass rectangle? DON'T MISS: Does it even matter that last year’s iPhone 6s is so much faster than the new Galaxy Note 7? What is it? Touch Disease is a name given by electronics repair blog iFixit to a peculiar problem affecting some iPhones. Owners will find their devices suddenly stop working properly, the Touch ID sensor refuses to work at all, and grey bars appear along the top of the screen. Apple hasn't given any definitive information on the problem yet, but it appears to be caused by faulty touch controllers on the logic board. Those controllers are responsible for both the display and the Touch ID fingerprint sensor, so it makes sense that a problem with that causes problems with the display and the finger input. Who does it affect? As far as we can tell, mostly iPhone 6 and 6 Plus owners. As outspoken independent technician Louis Rossman explains, the problem may be caused by a design flaw in the 6 and 6 Plus. The touch controller chip doesn't have underfill between it and the logic board. Underfill is basically glue that holds a chip in place, so without it, the chip is more susceptible to being knocked around and de-soldered. Some repair technicians have also linked the flaw to Bendgate, the notorious issue with iPhone 6 Pluses that caused them to bend with little pressure. iPad Rehab’s Jessa Jones told Cult of Mac that the problem might be caused by the fact that bigger iPhone 6 units do tend to bend when a certain force is applied. https://youtu.be/-iX7TyEjJ2E “Nearly 90 percent of devices with Touch IC Disease are iPhone 6 Pluses,” Jones said. And it’s all because of Apple’s design choices. In the iPhone 6, instead of using a metal shield to protect the board like on the iPhone 5s, Apple reverted to a sticker shield. The sticker doesn’t protect the chips as good when the board bends and the Touch IC chip is especially susceptible to damage when the phone bends. “This is a signature failure,” said Jones. “Every phone has one, but this one is a signature failure that got to epic proportions.” What does Apple say? The real problem here is that Apple is refusing to acknowledge this as a problem worthy of repair or replacement. Since most of the devices are out of warranty, and Apple doesn't do advanced fixes like resoldering a chip in store, customers' only option (according to Apple) is to buy a new iPhone. Now, there's a good chance that if enough people make enough noise about the problem, Apple will issue an extended warranty program and fix affected devices free of charge. It's happened in the past with faulty Macbooks (and, to an extent, with the iPhone 4's Antennagate), so with enough complaining, it's a good possibility. How likely am I to suffer it? There's a thread on Apple's support forums that's currently 62 pages long and growing, indicating that this isn't a small, localized problem. But since the problem appears to be caused by physical damage, just taking good care of your phone might be enough to keep you safe. A strong case should limit the chance of any bending and help protect the chip from damage, so that's not a bad idea. If your phone does start malfunctioning, some repair technicians will be able to fix the damage. Since it involves potentially replacing a chip on the logic board, it's a fix for more specialized repair shops. It's a lot more involved than replacing a cracked screen, so using a well-reviewed mail-in technician like Rossman is a better idea than your local "i fix iFones."

Associated Press i By Lisa Gutierrez lgutierrez@kcstar.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Here’s just one more reason it must be good to be Barbra Streisand — even if Siri can’t pronounce her name correctly. On a British morning talk show this week, the legendary singer revealed that she once asked Apple co-founder, the late Steve Jobs, to help her with a computer problem. “I couldn’t figure out something on my computer and nobody could figure it out, no IT guy, so I said, ‘Can you get Steve Jobs on the phone?’” she said, according to The Guardian. And just like that — she probably didn’t even have to snap her always gorgeously manicured fingers — she got Jobs on the line. “I asked him about this problem and he couldn’t figure it out,” she said. “He gave me his IT guy, who also couldn’t figure out. That was funny.” She went straight to the top of the Apple food chain again more recently when she called the man who succeeded Jobs, Tim Cook, to complain that Apple’s personal voice assistant Siri mispronounces her name. It should be “Streisand with a soft s, like sand on the beach. I’ve been saying this for my whole career,” she complained to NPR. “And so what did I do? I called the head of Apple, Tim Cook, and he delightfully agreed to have Siri change the pronunciation of my name, finally.” Cook apparently told her the change would take place with Siri’s next update on Sept. 30. She has circled the date. “So let’s see if that happens because I will be thrilled,” she told NPR. Streisand wrapped up a nine-city tour with a concert in Toronto this week. “I love Canada and it’s great to be back here. I can’t believe this is the end of my tour,” she told the crowd at the Air Canada Centre. “I went shopping today and the storekeeper said, ‘You’re American, have you got any loonies?’ And I said, ‘Just one — Donald Trump.’” Streisand, a Hillary Clinton supporter, used to date former Canadian prime minister Pierre Trudeau, whose son now has the job. “A least you can turn on the television and you can see Prime Minister Justin Trudeau,” she said. “He’s like all the nice Jewish boys in Brooklyn. He went into his father’s business.” Related content LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Stargazing Suggested for you   Comments Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos 2:52 Workout regime brings new life to Kansas City gunshot victim Pause 2:07 Homicide victims of 2016 remembered at prayer vigil 1:17 Bill Self: KU fortunate to win after poor defensive effort against TCU 0:43 High school basketball game ends in three buzzer-beaters 58:42 Chiefs 37, Chargers 27: Postgame analysis 1:19 Tyreek Hill on his 95-yard punt return 3:07 KU coach Bill Self on Landen Lucas and Sunflower Showdown 3:55 KC bar hopping with George Wendt and friends 1:49 Chiefs on-field celebration of AFC West title 0:57 Get to know the AFC playoff field Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email 6 days ago Iconic 'Star Wars' actress Carrie Fisher has died at age 60 2:33 6 days ago Iconic 'Star Wars' actress Carrie Fisher has died at age 60 3:55 a month ago KC bar hopping with George Wendt and friends 3:56 a month ago 21 recipients honored with Presidential Medal of Freedom View more video Stargazing Monday Mixer: ‘American Ninja Warrior’ returning to KC, and Kat McNamara’s ‘Shadowhunters’ is back Former 'Hills' star Lauren Conrad announces pregnancy Technical problems doomed Mariah Carey’s New Year’s Eve show, spokeswoman says Listen: Prince, Mariah Carey, Bruce Springsteen, The Muppets and more do ‘Auld Lang Syne’ Tennis superstar Serena Williams announces engagement to Reddit co-founder with poem Entertainment Videos Subscriptions Digital Subscriptions Home Delivery E-Star Site Information Customer Service About Us Contact Us Newspapers in Education Social, Mobile & More Facebook Twitter Mobile apps and E-Star Mobile Alerts Newsletters Advertising Advertising information Print Digital Place a Classified Local Deals Shopping Copyright Commenting Policy Privacy Policy Terms of Service Subscriptions Digital Subscriptions Home Delivery E-Star Site Information Customer Service About Us Contact Us Newspapers in Education Social, Mobile & More Facebook Twitter Mobile apps and E-Star Mobile Alerts Newsletters Advertising Advertising information Print Digital Place a Classified Local Deals Shopping More Copyright Commenting Policy Privacy Policy Terms of Service

 The CEO of the 'Apple of vaping' explains why the comparison makes sense Melia Robinson Aug. 26, 2016, 3:13 PM 7,255 facebook linkedin twitter email print This is an artistic rendering of what a Pax Labs and Apple collaboration might look like. We only wish it were real. Melia Robinson/Business Insider The Pax 2 vaporizer is smart design at its best. The brushed aluminum body features clean lines and sensors in the mouthpiece that activate the device. It monitors the oven temperature every 30 seconds, allowing for a smooth hit of loose-leaf tobacco or marijuana every time. Some have called it the "iPhone of vaporizers," making its manufacturer the "Apple of vaping." But both monikers have been used to describe lots of players in the industry. The comparison makes sense in the case of Pax Labs, the company behind the Pax 2 and Juul e-cigarettes, because the two companies share a belief that technology shouldn't be overly complicated, according to newly minted CEO Tyler Goldman. "Great technology is generally simple to use," said Goldman, who described the Apple comparison as apt but also aspirational, considering Apple's $586 billion market cap. Steve Jobs once described Apple's design ethos as "intuitively obvious" — things work the way a user expects them to. The company's operating systems put a lid on customization. Steve Helber/AP Images Pax Labs subscribes to a similar ethos. Taking a hit from a Pax 2 vaporizer is as easy as placing your lips on the mouthpiece and inhaling. The LED lights glow green when the device is in use and red when it needs a charge. There are no buttons. Like an iPhone, the Pax 2 comes at a premium. It costs $279, five times as expensive as vape pens that work just as well. Still, more than 1 million Pax 2 vapes have been sold globally. Goldman argues that one of the biggest similarities between Pax Labs and Apple is a commitment to getting better all the time. The company dabbled in designing e-cigarettes before releasing version one of the Pax in 2012. Today, the Pax 2 and the newer e-cigarette, Juul, are leaders in the space. "I would say we're probably investing more — or disproportionately more — in R&D in our category than Apple is doing in their category," Goldman said. "And ultimately, great products only remain great products by continuing to evolve."

Finance Search Apple issues update after cyber weapon capturedBy Glenn Chapman | AFP – Fri, Aug 26, 2016 7:32 PM AEST Related Content View Photo Researchers at Lookout mobile security firm and Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto said they uncovered a fierce, three-pronged cyber attack targeting a dissident's iPhone "that subverts even Apple's strong security environment" Apple iPhone owners on Friday were urged to install a quickly released security update after a sophisticated attack on an Emirati dissident exposed vulnerabilities targeted by cyber arms dealers. Researchers at Lookout mobile security firm and Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto said they uncovered a fierce, three-pronged cyber attack targeting a dissident's iPhone "that subverts even Apple's strong security environment." Lookout and Citizen Lab worked with Apple on an iOS patch to defend against what was called "Trident" because of its triad of attack methods, the researchers said in a joint blog post. "We were made aware of this vulnerability and immediately fixed it with iOS 9.3.5," Apple said in a released statement. Trident is used in spyware referred to as Pegasus, which a Citizen Lab investigation showed was made by an Israel-based organization called NSO Group. It was acquired by the US firm Francisco Partners Management six years ago, according to Lookout and Citizen. Lookout referred to Pegasus as the most sophisticated attack it has seen, sneakily accessing calls, cameras, email, passwords, apps and more on iPhones. The spyware was detected when used against Ahmed Mansoor, a human rights activist in the United Arab Emirates, who has been repeatedly targeted using spyware. - Phishing scheme - After receiving a suspicious text with a link, he reported the matter to Citizen Lab, which worked in conjunction with San Francisco-based Lookout to research the affair. "The attack sequence, boiled down, is a classic phishing scheme: send text message, open web browser, load page, exploit vulnerabilities, install persistent software to gather information," the joint blog post said. "This, however, happens invisibly and silently, such that victims do not know they?ve been compromised." Mansoor received text messages on August 10 and 11 promising that secrets about detainees being tortured in UAE jails could be accessed by clicking on an enclosed link, researchers said. Had he fallen for the ruse, the Trident chain of "zero-day exploits" would have broken into his iPhone and installed snooping software. Once infected, Mansoor's iPhone would have been turned into a "spy in his pocket" capable of tracking his whereabouts and conversations, Citizen Lab said. Mansoor was targeted five years ago with FinFisher spyware and again the following year with Hacking Team spyware, according to Citizen Lab research. "The use of such expensive tools against Mansoor shows the lengths that governments are willing to go to target activists," the researchers said. Although the cyber attack on Mansoor was not linked to a specific government, Citizen Lab said indicators pointed to the UAE. UAE authorities did not comment on the matter. Lookout and Citizen believe the spyware has been "in the wild for a significant amount of time." "It is also being used to attack high-value targets for multiple purposes, including high-level corporate espionage on iOS, Android and Blackberry." Citizen Lab has also found evidence that "state-sponsored actors" used NSO weapons against a Mexican journalist who reported on high-level corruption in that country and on an unknown target in Kenya. The NSO tactics included impersonating sites such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, the British government's visa application processing website, and a wide range of news organizations and major technology companies, the researchers said. - Cyber arms dealers - Mansoor's decision to enlist Citizen Lab instead of falling into the trap gave researchers a rare chance to expose the work of "shady cyber arms dealers" who command high prices for morally questionable services, Lookout vice president of security research Mike Murray told AFP. Invoices posted online have shown that hackers can charge tens of thousands of dollars per target hit with their software. "The smartphone is a valuable target, and breaking into it is a valuable skill set," Murray said. "People who can do this, and with wiggle room in their moral code, have realized the business opportunity." NSO Group has been around since 2010 and the capture of one of its weapons was billed as a first. Studying Trident has helped cyber defenders find ways to spot spyware that had been operating unseen, and they are "actively catching it in the wild now," Murray said. He declined to reveal anything about other targets, saying that they were people likely to be under surveillance in other ways by local authorities. Citizen Lab saw the attack on Mansoor as further evidence that "lawful intercept" spyware has significant abuse potential, and that some governments can't resist the temptation to use such tools against political opponents, journalists and human rights defenders.

Stop, thief! A patent awarded to Apple this week would capture the fingerprints and mug shots of unauthorized people attempting to log in to iOS devices. In the patent filing, Apple Insider reports, Apple describes software that would store biometric information of someone attempting to access a device without permission. Several conditions could trigger the recording, including an instruction sent to the phone or tablet from another device, similar to how Find My iPhone allows you to remotely wipe your phone. Once activated, the device would capture fingerprints "from one or more fingerprint sensors," images or video of the user attempting access, audio from the microphone, and other forensic information like how fast or how hard the user presses buttons on the device. All the information gathered could be sent to Apple's servers, where it could be cross-referenced with an online database containing information of known phone thieves. That information would be collected and analyzed in compliance with "well-established privacy policies," according to the patent. The filing also notes that identifying information would be deleted after a certain period of time if it's not needed. Related Here's How Hackers Steal Fingerprints From Your Phone Here's How Hackers Steal Fingerprints From Your Phone Apple acknowledges that the patent's approach to identifying thieves is not foolproof, since they could still correctly guess a user's passcode. And, of course, tech companies do not always use the tech they patent in actual products. Even as Apple contemplates surveillance software to catch thieves' fingerprints, it is also reportedly planning to redesign the physical elements of its devices that would make that approach possible. According to Bloomberg, the company is already at work on a major redesign of the iPhone for 2017 that removes the "home" button. That could mean that the Touch ID fingerprint sensor will be moved to the back or sides of the handset, or perhaps integrated into the display.

We've got all of these bags on hand so we can give clear details on construction, quality, utility, and more. For today's giveaway, we've partnered with Pad & Quill, a company that makes a whole line of luxury Apple accessories from cases to Apple Watch bands to leather bags. We'll be giving away the Luxury Briefcase in Galloper Black with Chestnut accents. Pad & Quill's Luxury Briefcase, priced at $495, is a large bag (15 inches by 11 inches by 4.2 inches) with enough pockets to hold whatever you might need to carry on a day to day basis. There are two outer pockets for holding papers or other small, flat accessories, along with a main interior pocket that can hold up to a 15-inch MacBook. The main pocket has several smaller pockets inside (two dividers with five pockets total), perfect for holding all kinds of accessories. I was able to fit my MacBook Pro, Retina MacBook, iPad Pro, iPad mini, iPhone in the bag along with various sundries like a hairbrush, a water bottle, a battery pack, pencils, two notebooks, and more. It holds a lot. There's a full nickel zipper at the top and a flap that folds over and snaps, so the contents within the bag stay safe and protected while you're hauling it around. When full, this is not a light bag - it weighs in at three pounds by itself. Made of a thick, durable full-grain American cowhide leather, the Luxury Briefcase is immaculately constructed with features like careful hand stitching, rigid but comfortable leather handles and a removable shoulder strap with a leather pad. Out of the box, the Luxury Briefcase is stiff and pristine, but with use, it'll loosen up and develop a unique, worn in look. The leather has been tanned so it's resistant to stains and water, and the interior is made from a durable pigskin that looks like it's going to hold up well to daily abuse. Pad & Quill's bags are all handmade and it shows in their construction. This looks like a $500 bag, and it's nice enough to take to the office, but casual enough that it doesn't look out of place in a less formal setting. One MacRumors reader will be able to win a Luxury Briefcase from Pad & Quill. To enter to win, use the Rafflecopter widget below and enter an email address.

The companies range across multiple industries including Apple, Delta Air Lines, Hilton, Ikea and more. In the United States, women working full time earn an average of 79 cents for every dollar men make, according to Census data. Black women are paid 63 cents and Latina women 56 cents compared to every dollar paid to white men. Several recent studies have confirmed the existence of the wage gap across industries and employment levels. More than 50 companies have signed the White House Equal Pay Pledge, which has been in the works for some time now. In January, President Obama signed an executive order requiring businesses with more than 100 employees to report their wage data broken down by race and sex to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Each company that signed today included a personal pledge. Some excerpts are below: Apple: Equal work deserves equal pay. This past year, Apple looked at the total compensation for U.S. employees and closed the gaps we found. We’ve achieved pay equity in the United States for similar roles and performance. Women employees at Apple earn one dollar for every dollar male employees earn.

We regularly review our compensation practices to ensure pay equity, and have done so for many years. We complete thorough statistical analyses to compare the compensation of men and women performing similar work. As such, we are proud to share that at Facebook, men and women earn the same. We encourage efforts to establish methods to close the wage gaps around the world. Ikea: We know that each individual adds value to the team, and we are committed to creating an inclusive work environment that encourages our diverse and competent co-workers to be themselves, to apply their unique perspectives at work, and to assume responsibility for our growth. In addition to being the right thing to do, creating this environment also improves our business results and strengthens our competitiveness.

Follow TechnoBuffalo A curved OLED display, no home button, and a switch to Intel chips could be among the changes Apple makes to future iPhones. According to Nikkei Asian Review, citing “industry experts,” Intel’s recent commitment to Acorn RISC Machine (ARM) could be the impetus behind a future change in Apple’s supply chain. ARM architecture is currently developed and licensed by British company ARM Holdings. Right now, Apple relies on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) and Samsung for its mobile chips, but that will supposedly change as early as 2018. Apparently, Apple and Intel are already engaged in discussions, although they’re supposedly in the very early stages. In addition to Apple, Intel is reportedly looking to snatch a few big customers away from TSMC with its new pledge to ARM. Nikkei Asian Review says one aspect that’s sweetening the deal for Apple is the fact that Intel’s headquarters is based in Santa Clara, Calif., and not overseas. However, Apple typically relies on a diversified supply chain—TSMC and Samsung—so as to avoid low supply. Relying solely on Intel could potentially lead to supply issues. LG will be the first manufacturer to adopt Intel chips following the ARM deal, according to Nikkei Asian Review, a first step for Intel as it looks to make further inroads into the mobile market. Snagging a huge contract with Apple could be Intel’s big break.

		     Privacy Policy Thank you Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. Related iPhone 7 preview: Everything Apple will announce next week When it comes to the iPhone’s headphone jack: I’m with Woz! iPhone 7 launch may be accompanied by release of AirPods Video 5 Weirdest iOS Keyboards The big rumor surrounding Apple’s iPhone 7 is that it will completely abandon the 3.5mm headphone jack, a familiar port that has been around in one form or another for decades on end. Needless to say, Apple’s decision won’t be met without controversy. While alternatives such as Lightning-based audio and Bluetooth do exist, getting rid of a port that’s ubiquitous and as exceedingly reliable as the headphone jack is undoubtedly a risky move. + Also on Network World: When it comes to the iPhone’s headphone jack: I’m with Woz! + Recently, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak chimed in on the iPhone 7 and articulated that Apple may be going down the wrong path. During an interview with the Australian Financial Review, Woz said Bluetooth technology isn't yet suitable as a replacement to a wired headphone solution. "If it's missing the 3.5mm earphone jack, that's going to tick off a lot of people," Woz explained. "I would not use Bluetooth. I don't like wireless. I have cars where you can plug in the music, or go through Bluetooth, and Bluetooth just sounds so flat for the same music." And though not referenced by Woz, Bluetooth brings along a whole host of issues, including potential pairing problems and Bluetooth headphones running out of power. All that said, it will be interesting to see if Apple ships a 3.5mm headphone adapter with each iPhone 7 sold. Given that millions of iPhone users already use and enjoy non-Apple headphones, I would hope that Apple wouldn't be so arrogant as to either a) force users to use Apple's own white earbuds or b) pay an additional $20 for a headphone adapter. What remains to be seen is if Apple's Bluetooth solution for the iPhone 7 will push the industry forward. Apple, of course, isn't afraid of kicking legacy technologies to the curb, but it often does so when a more advanced and intuitive solution comes along. Needless to say, all eyes will be on Apple when the company introduces the iPhone 7 at a media event rumored to be taking place Sept. 7.

News Brands Reviews Acer Apple Doro Google HTC Huawei INQ Mobile LG Lobster Motorola Nokia Palm Samsung Research In Motion Sony Toshiba Features Apps Games Accessories Video Tip Us News Brands Reviews Acer Apple Doro Google HTC Huawei INQ Mobile LG Lobster Motorola Nokia Palm Samsung Research In Motion Sony Toshiba Features Apps Games Accessories Video Tip Us Top iPhone 6s battery cases for Pokémon Go By Manny Pham on 18:24, 26 Aug 2016 in General, Latest, News, Phones Tweet Battery consumption is a bane for any Pokemon Go player, so we looked far and wide to bring you the best iPhone 6s battery cases for Pokémon Go. Pokémon Go may be seeing a slow down at the moment, having seen a drop of 45 million active users to 35 million, prompting calls of “fads over” and “ah well, AR (augmented reality) was fun while it lasted.” But it’s far from over for the record-breaking game. CEO of Niantic Labs, John Hanke said players have only experienced 10 percent of the game. Niantic Labs will be rolling out the 90% in future, such as Pokémon centres, trading and mythic (ultra rare) Pokémon. There’s still plenty to do as players are still discovering hidden features, such as Eevee’s evolution secret. So for those of you who are still trying to be the very best, or at least evolve a Magikarp, read on to find out our top three iPhone 6/6s battery cases for Pokémon Go. The game as we know drains the life out of our smartphones like a very fun succubus. Pokémon Go makes use of the camera sensor and GPS to make the AR experience a reality. Apple Smart Battery Case (£79) Kicking things off is the official merchandise. We all know Apple for its quality and attention to detail. You can be guaranteed your money’s worth with products from the Cupertino-based company. Not surprisingly Apple has gone minimal in the design of the case with no patterns on the silicone exterior. Not even an LED light to see how much it has been charged, on the outside at least. The LED light is present inside of the case, when having your iPhone 6/6s inserted, you can check the Smart Battery’s capacity in the notification bar. That’s the kind of optimisation you get from Apple’s ecosystem. It boasts a massive 20 hours of video play back and 18 hours of Internet use on 4G. As for the actual battery capacity, it’s an odd 1877, not that much more than the cases below, but offers plenty of life. Mophie Juice Pack Reserve (£49.95) A battery case for those that don’t want it to seem like they’re carrying around their pet turtle. I am of course referring to the camel’s hump you get in a lot of iPhone 6s battery cases. The Juice Pack does away with the hump, instead embracing the chunk all around, making it a hefty case. Its all smooth plastic and feels sturdy enough to survive a drop, always a bonus for a case. Charging commences when you hold down on the power button behind, it can also be used to activate the LED lights, to inform you how much juice is left. It packs 1840mAh, adding around 60% extra life into your phone. At 100% with the iPhone’s battery you can get 22 hours of life. More than enough to hunt down Snorlax. Tech21 Evo Endurance (£62.97 currently on sale) Out of all the iPhone 6s battery cases, Tech21 offers the best protection. Accidentally bumping into another trainer is inevitable, especially when you both got your heads down. So why not get a case that not only keeps you topped up, but also protects your precious iPhone. Tech21 uses FlexShock, a technology that reduces to shockwaves sent to your iPhone when dropping it. Our pocket drop test barely phased the case or iPhone, Tech21 claim a drop from two metres is the limit, which we found out to be true. The battery itself is 1800mAh offering up to 11 hours of extra video playback. It also adds around 60% of charge, further strengthening the endurance claim. Currently on sale so snap it up quick!

By Meredith Cunningham, Komando.com 13,29913.2k photo courtesy of SHUTTERSTOCK A smartphone's battery never seems to last long enough. Taking pictures, playing music, making calls and sending texts all come with a price - one that means you should always have a charger handy. But if you're like most Americans, at the end of the day, you probably put your phone on the charger, leave it charging overnight and don't think twice about it. In fact, some will be using third-party chargers too (chargers not made by Apple or other reputable retailers). We've told you before this isn't a good idea - iPhones, Samsungs and other Android models have exploded and others have started fires after being smothered by a pillow. But now, there's yet another slew of problems stemming from chargers. A new report from The New York Times points out that your charging habits could be causing damage to your phone: Habit #1: Charging overnight. Habit #2: Frequent charging. Habit #3: Using the wrong charger. Why? As a phone charges, the lithium ions in the battery travel from one end of the phone to the other. The more these ions travel, the more wear and tear they cause on the battery, ultimately limiting the lifespan of an otherwise perfectly good battery. Therefore, if you're using an iPad Pro charger for your iPhone, the ions travel faster since the iPad Pro charger is more powerful than that of the iPhone. Use the wrong charger overnight or all the time, you'll gradually see your battery life diminish - usually after two years. Don't worry if you're not ready to change your charging habits just yet. Solutions? The fix isn't guaranteed, but make sure you're using the right charger for your gadget. Charge less frequently and if you can avoid it, don't charge your phone overnight. For example, don't use an iPad charger for an iPhone. If you can, leave it on a less powerful charger if you're going to leave it overnight. Or, if you don't want to do anything, you can do that too. A 2015 Gallup survey cited by the Times shows that 44 percent plan to upgrade their phone within two years, which is when battery life begins to show signs of fading. If you fall into that category then you have nothing to worry about. Please share this information with everyone.

But when The Washington Post asked Apple CEO Tim Cook about the billions that his company has stashed in tax havens around the world, Cook declared: "We're not going to bring it back until there's a fair rate. There's no debate about it." And nothing happened, either to Cook or to Apple. Because when it comes to taxes, it's truer today than ever that only the little people pay. Apparently though, that's not enough for the CEOs of multinational corporations, like Tim Cook. He doesn't just want to avoid taxes, he wants Americans to know that Congress isn't writing the rules; Apple is. Dave Johnson from Campaign for America's Future wrote a great article about this titled, "CEO Of Giant Corporation Tells US Government He's the Boss of Them." In it, Johnson writes: "[T]hese days huge multinational corporations are the boss of our Congress. So, CEO Cook gets away with it, and with keeping $181 billion in tax havens to dodge paying $59 billion in taxes. Cook knows he can just come out and say they are not going to pay their taxes until there is a 'fair rate.'" - Advertisement - And he's right. But Apple is by no means the only corporation doing this. In March, Citizens for Tax Justice reported that US Fortune 500 corporations are avoiding up to $695 billion in US federal income taxes by holding $2.4 trillion of "permanently reinvested" profits offshore. That's nearly $700 billion that the largest US corporations -- corporations like Netflix, Nike and Citigroup -- are stashing in offshore tax havens. And now Tim Cook is setting an outrageous precedent by flagrantly declaring that Apple won't pay a dime of what's owed unless the US government does what he says. It's not that these corporations don't rely on tax dollars from the government; they use our interstates, they use our municipal water systems, our court systems protect their patents and copyrights, and their products rely on government-developed technologies like GPS. They just don't want to pay for it. - Advertisement - Corporate executives like Tim Cook are plainly putting profits and the well-being of their investors ahead of the well-being of the country. Average Americans can't decide to refuse to pay taxes for any reason. But a CEO like Tim Cook can simply say that his corporation won't bring its money home until he gets what he wants -- "no debate about it." In his piece, Johnson translates exactly what a "fair rate" means: "[H]uge multinational corporations will tell you a 'fair rate' would be zero. Or better yet, how about We the People just bow down and pay taxes to them. The corporate tax rate used to be 50%. CEOs complained it was 'unfair' so it was lowered to 35%."

Given the likelihood of the next generation of smartphone buyers to prioritize visual language over text-based communications, this is probably a smart move for the tech giant, especially as its competing neighbors Facebook and Google continue to grow in influence. While platforms like Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter have already released a myriad of features allowing users to edit videos and photos, with ever-evolving options to add stickers, drawings, animations and AR enhancements, iOS' camera app editing features have up to this point been relatively basic in comparison, limited to clip trimming, cropping and a few Instagram-copped filters. According to Bloomberg's sources at Apple, the tech company will be drawing on the staff behind its Final Cut Pro and iMovie software to give the existing iOS video app a makeover that will allow users to swiftly create more interesting and shareable content. Bloomberg's Apple sources have referred both to a "closed" use case of the video editor, to be used within iOS-specific apps like iMessage and readily shared with iPhone contacts, as well as a movement toward a more open format shortening the somewhat cumbersome steps users are currently required to take to share content created in the iOS video editor to social platforms like Twitter and Instagram. Communicators shouldn't get too excited that they've found the next Snapchat just yet. For one, Bloomberg's sources warn that "the project could be killed if it doesn’t meet the company’s timetable and expectations." Furthermore, to avoid sacrificing trademark features for the sake of staying relevant (as with iTunes and Apple Music), Apple will need to make a choice: Is it going to be the next social platform, or is it establishing itself as a leader in creating content outside social platforms? We'll have to wait until at least next year to find out.

TvOS 10 brings some notable changes to the platform such as single sign-on and a dark mode. It’s highly not recommended to run this beta as it may cause problems with your Apple TV down the road. However, to proceed: head to Apple’s Developer portal and download the necessary profile to your Mac or PC. Plug the device in via the USB-C port on the back of your Apple TV and fire up iTunes. From there, tap Option (Mac) / Shift (Windows) + Update and select the profile. Once completed, head over to your Apple TV’s settings > system > Software Update. If it does not appear, reboot your Apple TV and it should prompt you to update. If you spot anything interesting, be sure to leave us a comment below!

Tech CES 2017 Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Super Bowl Ads     Steve Wozniak Thinks Apple Should Not Ditch 3.5mm Headphone Jack In IPhone 7 Posted: Aug 26 2016, 12:17pm CDT | by Ahmed Humayun, Updated: Aug 26 2016, 1:45pm CDT, in News | Apple   Photo Credit: Getty Images   Steve Wozniak hasn’t been a part of Apple since 1985 but that didn’t discourage him from offering his opinion on the new iPhone 7 scheduled for release this coming September. Wozniak wanted Apple to know that he had its best interests at heart and didn’t want Apple to do anything that would jeopardize its standing. Don't Miss: Victoria's Secret Fashion Show 2016 The idea of the rumored elimination of the standard 3.5 mm headphone jack from the upcoming iPhone has him worried. Wozniak doesn’t think iPhone users would like the idea of being restricted to using Bluetooth headphones or Lightning cable headphones very appealing. He told the Australian Financial Review ““If it’s missing the 3.5mm earphone jack, that’s going to tick off a lot of people, “I would not use Bluetooth … I don’t like wireless. I have cars where you can plug in the music, or go through Bluetooth, and Bluetooth just sounds so flat for the same music. “Mine have custom ear implants, they fit in so comfortably, I can sleep on them and everything. And they only come out with one kind of jack, so I’ll have to go through the adaptor, If there’s a Bluetooth 2 that has higher bandwidth and better quality, that sounds like real music, I would use it. But we’ll see. Apple is good at moving towards the future, and I like to follow that.” Wozniak wasn’t very pleased with how the only thing justifying the price increase of the Apple Watch was the change in bands. He wrote down his two cents on Reddit, saying that “I love my Apple Watch, but - it’s taken us into a jewelry market where you’re going to buy a watch between $500 or $1,100 based on how important you think you are as a person. The only difference is the band in all those watches. Twenty watches from $500 to $1,100. The band’s the only difference? Well this isn’t the company that Apple was originally, or the company that really changed the world a lot.” He also voiced his opinion over Apple’s low tax bill: “I don’t like the idea that Apple might be unfair – not paying taxes the way I do as a person. I do a lot of work, I do a lot of travel and I pay over 50% of anything I make in taxes and I believe that’s part of life and you should do it.” Since he bid farewell to Apple, Wozniak has spent his time developing the first programmable universal remote control, teaching computer classes at an elementary school, building an early consumer GPS device and launching a comic convention in Silicon Valley with former Marvel Comics boss Stan Lee.

Tech CES 2017 Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Super Bowl Ads     IPhone 7 Reportedly In Short Supply Posted: Aug 26 2016, 10:40am CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, Updated: Aug 26 2016, 10:43am CDT, in News | Apple     Reports from the supply chain say that the iPhone 7 might be in short supply. The iPhone 7 is expected to be unveiled on September 7 and go on sale two weeks later. When Apple releases a new iPhone, you have to be quick to get your pre-order in to be one of the first owners of the new iPhone. Apple always sold through the initial batch of iPhones and you quickly can end up waiting weeks for fulfillment of your order. Don't Miss: NES Classic Alternatives are Cheaper Japanese Nikkei reports that Apple has hit an issue with faulty components that limits the production run of the iPhone 7 launch inventory. These type of iPhone shortage reports appear each year ahead of the iPhone release. These reports are a sign that the new iPhone is near. Nikkei also quotes an analyst predicting the number of iPhone 7 devices Apple is making in 2016. "We estimate total iPhone 7 builds to be 74 (million) in 2H16F, compared to 84 (million) for iPhone 6s in 2H15. Together with pricing pressure, we expect most Apple food chain suppliers to see (year-on-year) revenue decline for the rest of the year," said Jeff Pu at Yuanta Investment Consulting. For Apple to sell 10 million less iPhone 7 than iPhone 6S would not be good. If the demand is really that low for the new iPhone 7 remains to be seen. The leaks have shown that the iPhone 7 is a decent upgrade with several new features, despite staying in the iPhone 6 design language. The iPhone 7 is expected to be unveiled on September 7. If the rumored date holds than Apple is going to send out media invites for the iPhone 7 event soon. The iPhone 7 will feature besides the new A10 CPU, up to 256GB storage, improved cameras and an improved iPhone 6 design. The home button is likely going to be touch sensitive.  Comments You May Like The Author Luigi Lugmayr Luigi Lugmayr (Google+) is the founding chief Editor of I4U News and brings over 15 years experience in the technology field to the ever evolving and exciting world of gadgets.

Apple Releases iOS 10 Beta 8 to Developers and Public Beta 7 to Everyone Else GO The final release will launch in the first week of September Aug 26, 2016 18:40 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  Today, August 26, 2016, Apple has seeded the eighth Beta build of the upcoming iOS 10 mobile operating system to developers enrolled in the Apple Developer program, along with the seventh Public Beta to public beta testers. iOS 10 Beta 8 and Public Beta 7 builds are here just one week after the Beta 7 and Public Beta 6 releases announced last Friday, on August 19, 2016, and they contain even more fixes and under-the-hood improvements to further polish existing functionality, as well as to harden the security of the operating system used in all iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch devices. There are currently no details about the exact changes implemented in these new Beta releases. Still, we have a feeling that they have something to do with the fact that Apple pushed the fifth stable maintenance update to the iOS 9 series of its mobile OS last evening, patching two kernel security issues and a WebKit bug that could have allowed attackers to steal sensitive information. iOS 10 coming in September Now that Apple has seeded the eighth Beta build to developers and Public Beta 7 to everyone else, we firmly believe that it's also the last we'll see from the Cupertino company, which will soon prepare for its September event where a new iPhone could be unveiled, powered, of course, by the final release of the iOS 10 mobile operating system. The rest of the world should also be able to update their devices to iOS 10 in September, but there's currently no release date set in stone. Besides iOS 10, Apple will also unveil new versions of its other OSes, including macOS 10.12 Sierra, watchOS 3, and tvOS 10, along with the Xcode 8 IDE for developers and probably a new stable version of the open-source Swift programming language. #iOS 10 Beta 8#iOS 10 Public Beta 7#iOS 10#Apple#iPhone subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Apple Releases iOS 9.3.5 to Fix Important Security Issues for iPhone and iPad Upcoming iPhones Could Collect Fingerprints and Photos of Thieves Alleged Packaging Images Suggest iPhone 6 SE Moniker Apple Seeds macOS 10.12 Sierra Beta 7 to Devs, Public Beta 6 to Everyone Else New Leaked Image Points to Continuum-like Functionality for Samsung Galaxy S8 Asus ZenFone AR Tango-Enabled Smartphone Inadvertently Confirmed by Qualcomm HTC's Next Flagship to Be Called “U Ultra,” Rumored to Pack 6-Inch Display ASUS Launching New ZenFone With Snapdragon 835 SoC at CES Ubuntu 17.04 Skips First Alpha for Opt-In Flavors, GCC 6.3.0 Hits the Repository Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking Parrot Security OS 3.4.1 Includes GNUnet PeaZip 6.3.0 Free Archiving App Improves DPI Awareness, Adds Hamburger Menu Netrunner Desktop 17.01 "Baryon" Rolls Out Based on Debian GNU/Linux 9 "Stretch"    iOS 10 Public Beta 7 new ios apps NeuroNation: Train your brain to improve your memory and focus with NeuroNation Flipagram: Create cool videos by mixing up your photos with music Timer+: Set up dozens of timers and control them all with ease Nutshell Camera: Create some pretty cool videos with Nutshell Camera IKEA Catalogue: Check out the IKEA Catalogue for more than just furniture Complete: Complete puts a social twist to your regular to-do list/ task manager WebMD Baby: WebMD Baby offers help in how to best tend to your baby Reader comments How Apple Wanted (But Failed) to Boost Battery Life of Its New MacBook more on: Apple i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Hayley Tsukayama August 26, 2016 Follow @htsuka Apple chief executive Tim Cook. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) We're into high season for Apple rumors, and the latest of the bunch comes from Bloomberg — that Apple is working on a top-secret project to duplicate parts of Snapchat. The report says that Apple is in the early stages of developing a feature that lets users shoot a quick video, then overlay it with a filter or drawings before sharing it with contacts. When will we see this iSnap feature? Well, according to Bloomberg, the answer is likely "not any time soon," as the project is in its early days and subject to a lot of review before it gets to consumers: "The eventual launch and scale of the integrated social features are contingent upon approval from a team inside Apple that analyzes the privacy implications of products before their introduction, according to a person familiar with the matter. This team has the power to veto new features if they could potentially expose too much user data, the person said." At first blush, the Snapchat copycat feature sounds kind of sad for Apple, which has notably never succeeded in making an actual social network. Social networks are not easy to create. Just ask Google, which has revamped and revitalized Google+ so many times that it's hard to keep track of how many times the network has been declared dead. But Apple's efforts in the social area have been even less notable. There was the ill-fated (and mostly forgotten) music-focused Ping network. There's also Apple Music Connect, which is designed to get artists to communicate with fans who are also Apple Music subscribers — but not for fans to connect with each other. In general, Apple's failure to get in on the social media boom has been repeatedly criticized by those who find it both puzzling and infuriating that the company is missing out on such a huge trend. But the way social networks have evolved may change that story line. Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram and others are focusing more on messaging — an area that Apple has been quietly and steadily expanding on for years. Most iPhone users probably don't give much thought to Messages, which is the default way that you can text your friends, but it's actually a pretty robust social tool. The company is also opening up an app store just for Messages, which will let users customize their messaging experience to include tie-ins from other apps — suggest movie times in your text message through the Fandango app! — as well as less-practical but more-fun embellishments such as stickers. Down the line, it'd be easy to see Apple and others create Messages apps that greatly expand the app's functions. Which brings us back to the reported video-sharing feature. If the past is anything to go by, we'll probably just see it integrated into our existing apps, as a preinstalled app on our phones, or maybe as an optional Messages app. The truth is that even the biggest social networks seem nowadays to be growing into territory that Apple has a pretty good handle on. The company has waited so long to jump on the social media train that the track has looped back around to meet it. business technology the-switch true Please provide a valid email address.

Artists who have given Apple exclusive access to new music have been told they won’t be able to get their tracks on featured playlists once the songs become available on Spotify, said the people, who declined to be identified discussing the steps. Those artists have also found their songs buried in the search rankings of Spotify, the world’s largest music-streaming service, the people said. Spotify said it doesn’t alter search rankings. Spotify has been using such practices for about a year, one of the people said, though others said the efforts have escalated over the past few months. Artists who have given exclusives to Tidal, the streaming service run by Jay Z, have also been retaliated against, the person said, declining to identify specific musicians. Biggest Challenger Apple’s music service has emerged as the largest challenger to Spotify over the past year, signing up more than 15 million subscribers since its debut last June, the company said two months ago. Exclusive deals for new music from artists such as Drake, Chance the Rapper and Frank Ocean are central to Apple’s strategy. Spotify has more than 30 million subscribers globally. Apple Music also has ways to promote artists, such as highlighting their songs in its Top Tracks section, giving it ways to play favorites with musicians. The dustup over exclusives comes at a critical time for Spotify, which is in the midst of renegotiating licensing contracts with the world’s biggest record labels. The company is aiming to hold an initial public offering by the end of next year, but needs more favorable long-term agreements with the labels to attract a higher valuation from investors, according to a person familiar with the plans. The company isn’t profitable despite generating more than $2 billion in revenue, in part because it has to give 55 percent of the money to labels and an additional cut to publishers. It’s not clear whether major artists like Drake and Ocean have been affected by Spotify’s measures, and their representatives didn’t respond to questions. In any case, artists of their stature need less help from Spotify to draw attention to their music, emerging acts rely on the service to find new listeners. The company has threatened to use its retaliatory practices on lesser-known artists who introduce music on a Beats One show hosted by DJ Zane Lowe, an architect of Apple’s radio service, the people said. One representative of a singer-songwriter said the client canceled plans to debut a song on Lowe’s show because of concern that the artist would lose promotion from Spotify. The agent asked not to be identified, and that the artist not be named, to avoid damaging relationships with the music-streaming companies. Lowe, a former BBC radio host, has introduced new tracks from his first day on the air with Beats One, and his show has become an important platform to debut songs worldwide. Ratcheting Up Apple and Spotify have been feuding since before Apple Music’s debut, and competition between the two ratcheted up again in the last several weeks after Apple proposed changing songwriting royalties in a way that would increase costs for competitors like Spotify by putting its music in a different category that requires a higher rate. Spotify has also accused Apple of blocking a new version of its iPhone app, the latest volley in an ongoing dispute over Apple’s cut of sales from its app store. Apple denied blocking Spotify’s app, saying its rival hadn’t met its terms of service. Led by former record executive Jimmy Iovine, Apple Music has kept its strategy flexible to appeal to what an artist wants. In the case of Frank Ocean and Drake, the company paid for exclusives. With Adele and Beyonce, it agreed to keep the music off its streaming service and initially only make it available for a paid download. The company also has been appealing to artists and industry executives by limiting its streaming service to paying subscribers and not having a free advertising-supported version like Spotify.

However, it has sought to make exclusive deals with some artists, such as rock band the 1975, but refused to limit the release to the company’s paid service only, as labels and musicians have sought, two of the people said. Spotify has said a robust free service is needed to attract new users who can eventually become subscribers.  Record labels are still pushing Spotify to let artists release music for paying subscribers only, and have yet to sign new long-term deals with the service as a result. Yet Apple’s ability to attract those big exclusives may also be in jeopardy. In an internal memo this week, Lucian Grainge, chief executive officer of Vivendi SA’s Universal Music Group, directed the heads of his company’s labels to stop giving any music services long-term exclusives, according to two people familiar with the matter. Universal has sold Apple many of its biggest exclusives, including Drake. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Author: Davey Alba. Davey Alba Business Date of Publication: 08.26.16. 08.26.16 Time of Publication: 2:10 pm. 2:10 pm On Women’s Equality Day, More Tech Companies Promise Change We’ve been celebrating Women’s Equality Day for 45 years. It was originally created to commemorate the 19th Amendment—the 1920 law that gave women the right to vote—but it’s now a reminder that, all these years later, women still haven’t reached complete equality. For one thing, the average American woman must work 15.5 months to earn the same amount of money that the average American man makes in 12. But at the same time, Women’s Equality Day is also a way of pushing for new change. Today is the latest example. A new group of Silicon Valley companies has signed the White House Equal Pay Pledge, including Apple, Dropbox, Facebook, IBM, LinkedIn, and Microsoft. The pledge was first introduced at the United State of Women Summit in June, and several tech giants had signed on then as well. The pledge is particularly important for the tech industry, where prominent gender gaps still exist and it can feel like change is taking hold quite slowly, even as many try to tackle the problem with the best of intentions. With the pledge, employers commit to conducting an annual company-wide gender pay analysis across jobs; will review hiring and promotion procedures to shed more light on unconscious biases; embed equal pay efforts into broader equity initiatives; and promote other best practices to close the national wage gap. Some of these efforts have already been underway in Silicon Valley, but signing the pledge formalizes the commitment and gives companies concrete aims to shoot for with each annual check-in. It also invites public scrutiny, with the companies essentially telling the world: yes, we’re willing to put our name against this promise—and we will answer to and be accountable to you.. All of which seems great—except there are still other entrenched, societal reasons that prevent some women from joining the workforce in the first place, or increase the odds that they’ll take on a job in the lower ranks of a company. At the tech company GoDaddy, for instance, which has already undertaken gender pay studies and released its data around it last year, women are paid slightly more across the whole company. But at the levels that arguably matter more—among technical positions and at the management level—women are paid less. In short, yes, signing a pledge is a good first step and a sign that these companies are willing to consciously confront the very real gender gaps that still plague American society today. But more real work is needed before years of systemic inequality can be overturned. And in 2016, after 45 whole years of commemorating Women’s Equality Day, maybe—just maybe—the public on the whole should be giving tech companies less of a pass on such an important issue. As a recent report from McKinsey showed, achieving full gender parity in the American workplace isn’t just a matter of fairness, it would also boost the US economy on the whole—to the tune of $4.3 trillion. Tech companies still cite a million different reasons for why the needle to get to full parity is moving so slowly. But dragging their feet on fixing the problem just means more money is being left on the table, every single day. Go Back to Top.

Now she’s teamed up with other major players on a new project meant to guide tech companies toward greater diversity and inclusion. Project Include is designed as an online community that will take an open source approach toward advising startup founders and human resource departments on how to successfully recruit, hire, and retain a diverse workforce. It will also offer advice to venture capital firms, which hold so much sway over how startups evolve—including how they hire. Pao says the project started as a dinner brainstorming session on how to make tech more diverse. Other participants include Slack engineer and ex-Googler Erica Baker, whose spreadsheet of Google salaries went viral, and Pinterest’s Tracy Chou, one of the earliest advocates of tracking diversity at tech companies. Pao, a one-time partner at Silicon Valley VC firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, sued her former employer in 2012, alleging she had been passed over for promotions and terminated for complaining. She lost the case, but the high-profile jury trial stoked a broader discussion of diversity in the tech industry. Pao also served as interim CEO of Reddit. She was instrumental in pushing stronger anti-harassment policies last year but stepped down after users revolted. Bethanye Blount, former chief engineer at Reddit who also resigned during that tumultuous period, has also joined Project Include. Go Back to Top.

It’s also going against the norm in other ways, as its latest diversity report shows. Today the company said that women now make up 54 percent of its workforce, up from 51 percent in 2014. What’s more, half of the leadership and management positions at Etsy belong to women, an impressive achievement, at least in the context of the tech industry’s dreary diversity record. In keeping with its pledge to buck conventions, Etsy also says it will no longer refer to gender in a binary way, reflecting its belief that “gender lies on a spectrum.” In its latest report, it classifies its employees as those who “identify as women,” “identify as men,” and identify as “other awesome gender identities.” The company says employees are given the opportunity to voluntarily self-report their gender from among more than 60 options. For those tracking the progress of diversity in tech (or, in most cases, the lack of progress), Etsy’s news is encouraging. Women typically comprise about 30 percent of the workforce at tech companies compared to 47 percent of the overall US workforce. Still, even Etsy mirrors the rest of the industry in the composition of its engineering staff, which is only 20.5 percent women. The company also shares the tech industry’s general lack of racial diversity. Etsy is 78.6 percent white and comes in below industry average for black, Latino, and Asian employees. “Looking at our updated numbers, we’ve noticed that while our concerted focus on gender equity yielded clear, positive results, the same was not true for our progress in advancing racial and ethnic diversity,” says Juliet Gorman, director of culture and engagement at Etsy. Not that the company doesn’t appear to be trying. It says it’s investing in relationships with organizations focused on improving diversity in tech, increasing its presence on campuses of historically black colleges, and expanding on other recruitment efforts. Etsy has taken some positive steps toward gender parity. But intersectionality is important, too. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. diversity in tech Etsy Skip Social. Skip to: Latest News.

The DIY e-commerce company said today that it will begin offering all new parents half-a-year of paid parental leave starting in April. In addition, Etsy will offer new adoption and surogacy benefits as well as coaching programs for new parents and their managers. “We felt like it was time. We felt the policies weren’t really as competitive anymore as we wanted them to be,” says Juliet Gorman, Etsy’s director of culture and engagement. Tech companies have long vied for the best employees by competing on benefits. Google and Facebook are known for their free food and other on-campus amenities. More recently, tech companies in particular have started focusing on perks for new parents. Microsoft, Netflix, and Adobe all expanded their programs last year with generous paid-leave programs that means parents aren’t pressured to choose between their new children and their jobs. Etsy says that part of the impetus for its program was to ensure uniform benefits for both male and female employees around the world, whether caring for a newborn or a newly adopted child. In the past, Etsy’s policies varied depending on the laws and standards of a locale. In the US, for example, Etsy offered only 12 weeks to primary caregivers and 5 weeks to secondary caregivers. Still, researchers say that seemingly generous parental leave policies mean little if companies don’t also foster a culture where employees themselves feel comfortable taking advantage of the time off. To work, that culture often has to be set from the top. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg set an example when he took two months of paternity leave after his daughter Max was born. At Etsy, CEO Chad Dickerson took nine weeks off when he and his wife adopted their son a few years ago. He’s also been an outspoken supporter of paternity leave. “We think of this as the long game,” Gorman says. Go Back to Top.

Davey Alba Business Date of Publication: 12.09.15. 12.09.15 Time of Publication: 5:45 pm. 5:45 pm Netflix Adds Hourly Workers to Its Generous Parental Leave Plan Netflix is expanding its impressive parental leave benefits to its hourly workers. The company’s generous plan had previously only applied to its salaried workforce. But the change comes with a caveat: hourly workers’ benefits still aren’t as good as the one being offered to Netflix’s corporate workers, and the specifics will vary depending on the company division—customer service, streaming, and DVD-by-mail. The change was first announced by Tawni Cranz, chief talent officer at Netflix, in an interview with trade publication Talent Management this week. Netflix confirmed to WIRED that hourly employees in its DVD-by-mail division will get up to 12 weeks of paid leave; customer service 14 weeks; and hourly streaming-division employees 16 weeks. “We always look for ways to improve as a company and that means regularly reviewing policies and benefits to ensure we are competitive and can attract and keep the best employees,” a Netflix spokeswoman told WIRED in an email. ‘Clearly, they got the message from the time that they announced the initial policy that a two-tiered parental leave system was not going to work.’ When Netflix dropped the news in August that it would let new moms and dads take unlimited paid leave for the first year after a child’s birth or adoption, the move was widely lauded. After all, in the US, where the law only requires that eligible new parents who have been at a company for a certain time be provided 12 weeks of unpaid leave, the policy sounded positively progressive—and a slew of companies soon followed Netflix’s lead. But the streaming giant came under fire when admirers of the plan learned that the new policy didn’t apply to Netflix’s hourly paid workers. Advocacy groups and Netflix’s own employees criticized the company for the exclusion. Now, it seems, Netflix is seeking to correct its oversight. “Clearly, they got the message from the time that they announced the initial policy that a two-tiered parental leave system was not going to work,” says Tim Newman, campaigns director of one advocacy group, Coworker.org. “I think it’s a credit to the customers and employees who spoke out about that they made this improvement—this is a step in the right direction.” Still, Newman points out, the system is still not equal for everyone. Responding to WIRED’s inquiry on why the paid parental leave system was not uniform for all hourly employees, Netflix said: “Fundamentally as a company, we want to offer coverage for all three—maternity, paternity and adoptions. Differences in benefits result from decisions made by the leadership of those parts of our business as well as the competitive landscape for each.” Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article.

The target of today’s backlash: IBM, which launched a well-intentioned, but completely tone-deaf, campaign on Twitter that urged women to get involved in STEM fields by hacking a hairdryer. Girls don't like science? Nonsense. Let’s blast away the barriers to #womenintech https://t.co/rrEFwjiBXD pic.twitter.com/eSiJ0UGsjB — IBM (@IBM) December 4, 2015 For obvious reasons—namely, the fact that IBM tried to combat gender stereotypes by perpetuating gender stereotypes—the tweet backfired. The company was flooded with a wave of sarcastic responses from female technologists and scientists, as well as the public at large: How to make progress in equality: start treating women like modern human beings instead of the 1950s housewife trope. #HackAHairDryer — Sage Franch (@theTrendyTechie) December 7, 2015 #HackAHairDryer into a flamethrower with which to set fire to gender clichés in the tech industry. — Simon Parkin (@SimonParkin) December 7, 2015 I don't even own a hairdryer!

Brb quitting my astrophysics PhD. #HackAHairDryer — Jessica V (@ThatAstroKitten) December 7, 2015 The good news is IBM knows it messed up, and has already decided to discontinue the misguided campaign. “The videos were part of a larger campaign to promote STEM careers,” the company told WIRED in a statement. “It missed the mark for some and we apologize.” What makes this specific screw-up all the more unfortunate is that it belies IBM’s historically aggressive support of workplace diversity in the tech industry, from its female CEO Ginni Rometty to its innovative school model P-TECH, which aims to bring low-income high school students into the STEM field. It’s hard to imagine how a company that’s been at this for so long could make such a rookie mistake. If nothing else, it proves just how far we still have to go before tech’s entrenched gender bias is a thing of the past. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. IBM Women in tech Skip Social.

Julia Greenberg Business Date of Publication: 11.20.15. 11.20.15 Time of Publication: 8:23 pm. 8:23 pm Mark Zuckerberg Will Take Two Months of Parental Leave Mark Zuckerberg said today that he will be taking two months off when his first daughter is born. “Priscilla and I are starting to get ready for our daughter’s arrival,” the Facebook founder said, referring to his wife, Priscilla Chan, in a post on his Facebook page. “We’ve also been thinking about how we’re going to take time off during the first months of her life. This is a very personal decision, and I’ve decided to take 2 months of paternity leave when our daughter arrives.” This news is, of course, great for Zuckerberg and his family. We wish them the best. But this is a big deal for the rest of us, too. Zuckerberg is perhaps the most prominent chief executive of a major public tech company to take this much time off following the birth of his child. That’s important, because executives set the tone for a company (and, in some ways, the country) when it comes to balancing work and family. Like some other major tech companies, Facebook already offers new parents a parental leave plan considered very generous by US standards. New parents at Facebook can take four paid months off. They receive benefits such as $4,000 for each child born or adopted. As we’ve written before, however, employees may feel reluctant to take advantage of such plans if their companies don’t have a culture that encourages taking time off. And company culture typically comes from the top. “Every day things are getting a little more real for us, and we’re excited to start this next stage in our lives,” Zuckerberg wrote. Let’s hope more companies will offer new parents more leave, and that dads will be able to follow his lead. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article.

Jason Henry/The New York Times/Redux A few weeks ago, actress Jennifer Lawrence took a stand against gender pay gaps in Hollywood—in a newsletter. To be clear, this is not just any newsletter. Lena Dunham’s Lenny Letter has become a must-read, in part as a platform for high-profile feminists. The latest is one-time venture capitalist Ellen Pao, who spoke out in Lenny Letter today about sexism in Silicon Valley. In her piece—”Silicon Valley sexism is getting better. Slowly”—Pao describes her career and the ways in which the industry’s biases began to themselves “crack by crack.”  Still, she says, Silicon Valley has started to make meaningful progress. “The biggest positive difference over the past 20 years is how women and minorities are sharing others’ bad behavior, data, and their own experiences publicly,” Pao writes. Pao has been relatively quiet in the weeks since she said she would not pursue an appeal in her failed gender discrimination lawsuit against her former employer, marquee venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins. In July, Pao stepped down as interim CEO of Reddit after facing intense backlash when a popular employee was abruptly fired and new anti-harassment policies introduced. That same month, she penned an op-ed in The Washington Post in which she said she had “endured one of the largest trolling attacks in history.” In Lenny Letter, Pao looks back at the longer arc of her career in the Valley: It was easier in her early work life, especially in her 20s. Then things started to get tougher. Fresh out of Harvard Law School, Pao says she felt she was doing well—and other women, including women of color, seemed to be succeeding, too. Schools, law firms, and successful senior partners all told them they were on track to have fantastic careers. But later, “our ranks thinned and progress got harder,” Pao writes. There were inconsistencies in what people said and what they actually did. “I saw many firms talking meritocracy but ignoring great opportunities that women brought in or giving men credit for them,” she says. “Unconscious” biases and bringing up “the pipeline problem” are excuses we shouldn’t fall for. Pao argues that when tech and VC leaders throw out these justifications, they’re merely saying, “We haven’t done anything wrong, and we don’t care to fix it.” But things are changing. People can now call out others’ bad behavior publicly. They’re sharing their experiences, and they’re doing valuable research. Pao points to the decision by Silicon Valley tech giants to voluntarily release their diversity statistics as a sign of progress. Researchers are looking at hard data around how the system treats people in tech, from graduation to hiring to the upper ranks of VC firms and tech companies. People are also sharing their stories on social media. Erica Baker, an ex-Googler, made waves when she described inconsistencies in salaries by gender and race. A Fortune reporter uncovered gender bias in performance reviews. Questions are being asked and a spotlight cast on the issues. Pao’s advice for other women and members of minority groups? Be resilient. Speak up—don’t be silent. For women facing struggles in a male-dominated work culture, Pao says there’s one important thing to remember: “You are not alone.” Go Back to Top.

The company, which oversees a network of websites, including the eponymous Gawker, is mostly white and mostly male.   The numbers are also comparable to Buzzfeed, another new media company that recently released data about the composition of its workforce. “After the announcement that I was being named permanent executive editor of Gawker Media, and after Buzzfeed’s publication of its diversity statistics last month, we received renewed calls internally from editorial staff members for an accounting of the racial and gender diversity of our teams,” Gawker executive editor John Cook writes. Gawker is 43 percent female, compared to 47 percent in the overall US workforce.That’s better than most tech companies: According to data compiled by The Verge, the biggest tech companies are 29 percent female on average. The gender ratio slips when just counting edit side: Cook says women make up 38 percent of Gawker Media’s editorial staffers. When it comes to race, Gawker fares worse than most major tech companies. Overall, Gawker Media is 79 percent white. By comparison, Google said this year that 60 percent of its overall staff is white. Facebook’s overall staff is 55 percent white; Apple’s workforce is 54 percent white. Gawker’s editorial staff is 78 percent white, Cook said. Gawker’s numbers aren’t unusual for tech or media, which can be even worse than tech when it comes to diversity. As my colleague Julia Greenberg noted in a recent piece, a survey from the American Society of News Editors found that the “percentage of minority journalists in daily-newspaper newsrooms” was under 13 percent. At The New York Times, public editor Margaret Sullivan noted that of the 20 critics on its culture desk, none are black. Go Back to Top.

The retail giant has expanded paid maternity leave to up to 20 weeks for birth moms and added six weeks of paid leave for new parents regardless of gender. As reported by The Seattle Times, this means that for the first time new dads at the company will be able to take time off following the birth (or adoption) of a child. The news comes just months after other tech giants, most notably Microsoft, Adobe, and Netflix, announced improved parental leave plans for their employees. Amazon, meanwhile, has faced public scrutiny over how it treats its employees following a scathing New York Times investigation that called its work culture into question. (Amazon and the Times later engaged in a very public back-and-forth over the fairness and accuracy of the story.) Following the Times investigation, former Amazon employee Julia Cheiffetz publicly called for the company to reevaluate its parental leave policies, claming she was effectively forced out following her maternity leave and cancer diagnosis. As Amazon heads into the holiday season—and kicks off Black Friday deals, well, now—it may be anxious to motivate its employees, who will undoubtedly be hard at work as the company enters the busiest shopping season of the year. Notably, Amazon’s policy appears not to apply just to high-end tech workers and executives, but more than 100,000 fulfillment center and customer service workers. Amazon may also be hoping to contain any damage that the Times story did to its public image. It will need to keep shoppers (and future prospective hires) happy, and it certainly doesn’t hurt if they feel good about how the company seems to treat new parents. No matter the motive, improved parental leave policies are good for new parents and their children. But as we’ve written before, experts say that it’s not enough for a company to have such policies in place. It also needs to have the supportive environment where employees are comfortable to take the time off that they need, knowing that they’ll be able to come back and pick up where they’ve left off.

On Tuesday, with a blog post, the company said it would increase its fertility benefit coverage from $10,000 to $40,000 for medical services and from $5,000 to $20,000 for prescription services by 2016. It also removed the medical diagnosis requirement for employees to get fertility benefits, which apparently left out same-sex couples. All employees will soon be able to get conception services. The move adds Intel to the roster of high-profile companies who are offering egg-freezing perks, including Facebook and Apple—no small perk considering a round of treatment can be as high as $12,000, plus storage and drug fees that can cost another four grand annually. Doctors also recommend at least two rounds of treatment—but the good news is this is still within the new coverage limits Intel plans to implement. Additionally, the chip-making company is tripling its adoption benefit coverage to $15,000 per adoption. And beginning next year, there will be no limit to the number of children for which an employee can seek adoption assistance. “While Intel is lucky to add such great new talent, we know that our existing employees have different experiences when trying to expand theirs,” Ogden Reid,  VP of human resources, said in a statement. “To help with that process, we are committed to being a leader in offering a broad range of benefits for employees and their families.” Intel already has one of the most radically transparent plans for improving corporate diversity, and this only adds to it. Offering generous pregnancy, egg-freezing, and adoption benefits could make the company more appealing to women and the LGBT community. Such perks help companies attract top talent, as we’ve written—to the end, of course, of having tech workers be as productive as possible for their employers.

In a diversity report released today, the company revealed that 69 percent of its employees are white. BuzzFeed BuzzFeed isn’t just a news and entertainment company after all—it’s also a tech company. And like many Silicon Valley tech giants, it touts its diversity by periodically releasing its latest diversity numbers in reports like the one it released today. For the second year in a row, Buzzfeed emphasized to its employees and the world at large that improving diversity is an “ongoing priority.” Founder and chief executive Jonah Peretti says the company is sharing its numbers “in an effort to track our progress and hold ourselves accountable to each other and the public.” But while BuzzFeed has been able to seemingly close the gender divide unlike some tech companies, it has room to improve when it comes to diversity. Google, for example, said this year that 60 percent of its overall staff is white. At Facebook, only 55 percent of the overall staff is white. Microsoft says 59.5 percent of its overall staff is white. However, in newsrooms across the US, it’s a somewhat different story. A recent survey from the American Society of News Editors found that the “percentage of minority journalists in daily-newspaper newsrooms” was around 12.76 percent. Earlier this year The New York Times’ public editor Margaret Sullivan noted that “there certainly are areas of The Times that could use more diversity, including its culture critics, where on a staff of 20, there are no black critics.”  “We care about diversity for moral reasons,” explains Peretti in a public note, “but we also know a diverse staff is a competitive advantage that allows us to recruit from the broadest possible pool of talent and have team members with a wide range of experiences and perspectives.” BuzzFeed To show its commitment to diversity, the company shared several graphs today that highlight its effort to continue building a more diverse staff. In addition to having more women than men at the company, one notable revelation is that BuzzFeed has more women global managers than male ones. When it comes to gender, its tech division, however, remains the starkest uneven split. Unlike last year, the company did not share today any specific targets for continuing to improve diversity in the next year nor did it offer any plans for how it will continue to improve diversity amongst its employees.

Not the digital kind, the “foot in the door” kind. Companies all too often hire from pools of job candidates who already have connections, and in an industry that’s predominantly male, that means more men have easier entrée. For everyone else, especially women, they’re left depending on luck. Now Google is backing a way to change this. The nonprofit Anita Borg Institute today is unveiling its ABI.Local program in conjunction with the first day of its annual Grace Hopper Celebration—the world’s largest event for women in computing. The idea is to help women technologists in cities around the world connect with each other locally to build the networks that will help build their ranks in the tech industry. “Establishing and growing a strong community of women who share our interests and career goals is imperative to keeping women in the field and broadening the appeal of a technical career to young women,” says Telle Whitney, the Anita Borg Institute’s CEO. In the run-up to its official launch today, ABI.Local has quietly reached nearly 1,300 people around the world in New York and Delhi. Today, the nonprofit says, ABI.Local launches in eight more metro areas, including Boston, Washington D.C., and Silicon Valley, thanks in part to donations from Google and an anonymous donor. In the coming year, the plan is to expand to the Middle East, Africa, Singapore, and elsewhere. The group has also launched a beta version of its ABI.Local website, which it hopes can serve as an online networking hub for women in tech. Aside from the female-centric focus, the ABI.Local groups will mostly deal in standard tech-networking fare, organizing technical talks, networking receptions, panels, hackathons, and workshops featuring local women technologists. Groups are gathering this week to watch the livestream of the Grace Hopper Celebration taking place in Houston. (Among other things, they may be watching for a repeat of a gaffe like the one from last year’s conference, where Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella slipped and said he believed women should “have faith” that they would get the “right raises as you go along.” Nadella quickly apologized after the incident.) In spite of slow progress revealed by the dismal workforce statistics at tech companies, the groundswell of public discussion around the very important issues of diversity in tech is gaining traction—and pushing the industry to change. In the end, it does take networks—networks in local groups, and networks at large conventions—to make that much more of a difference, and move the conversation forward. Go Back to Top.

One-time partner Ellen Pao has decided not to appeal the loss of her gender discrimination suit against her former employer, storied Silicon Valley venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. “I have decided to end my lawsuit against Kleiner Perkins,” Pao said in a statement sent to tech news site Re/code on Thursday. “I feel gratified that my actions have encouraged others to speak up about discrimination in venture capital and technology more broadly.” In late March, a jury denied Pao’s claims that Kleiner Perkins discriminated against her because of her gender, and retaliated against her for reporting gender bias at the firm. The six-week sex bias trial had captivated Silicon Valley and the larger tech industry, where women are still in the minority in spite of efforts to increase diversity. In the venture capital industry, the gender gap is even more prominent: in 2014, only 6 percent of partners at venture capital firms were women, according to a Babson College study. And though Pao ultimately lost the case, supporters lauded her efforts to draw attention to the ongoing battle to create a level playing field for women in tech. After KPCB successfully defended itself at trial, the venture capital firm demanded that Pao reimburse the $1 million or so it spent on legal costs—which Pao argued she shouldn’t have to pay. Instead, to resolve the suit completely, Pao told Re/code, she agreed to pay Kleiner the legal costs ordered by the judge in the case: a total of $275,966. Pao also emphasized, in her statement, that she and Kleiner did not reach an agreement to settle the matter with a payment to Pao, which she claims would have required her silence. “Settlement might have provided me with financial benefits, but only at the great cost of silence,” she said. “I refuse to be silent on these important issues.” The past year has been a rocky one for the former venture capitalist, who recently stepped down as interim CEO of online community Reddit after facing an all-out revolt over how to handle harassment and controversial content on the site. But Pao has made it clear that she is ready to turn over a new leaf. “I have been reengaging with friends and colleagues,” she told Re/code. “It’s over.” Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article.

Also following in the footsteps of so many others in tech, the results aren’t good: A vast majority of Slack’s employees—70 percent—are white. And 61 percent of the company is male. Still, you have to give Slack some credit. The company at least appears to be trying, and trying from the start instead of waiting years or decades into its existence to recognize that diversity is a serious issue. “It’s relatively easy for us to move the lever a small bit right now to make a significant change in our trajectory,” said Anne Toth, vice-president of people and policy, and Stewart Butterfield, Slack’s CEO, in a blog post describing the company’s diversity efforts. “If us doing this sooner rather than later yields a better result that alone will be a good thing for us to have done at Slack and, hopefully, for the industry at large.” Slack says it made the issue of diversity a priority while the company was still in its infancy, hiring an outside diversity consultant back when it employed only 75 people. It also says it’s begun examining its compensation data to make sure pay gaps don’t exist among its male and female workers. And it is making a concerted effort to be vigilant in its data collection and analysis to make real-time adjustments when recruiting new employees or updating its workplace policies. Doing Better by Starting Sooner Today, less than two years after introducing its app to the world, Slack employs about 250 people. And, digging into the numbers, it does appear to be doing better than many other tech companies. Seven percent of its technical workforce is African-American—which is actually saying something in a world where the combined black workforces of Google, Facebook and Twitter can fit on a single jumbo jet. But its overall workforce is still just 4 percent Black. Less than 1 percent of Slack employees, meanwhile, identified as Hispanic or Latino. And while only 39 percent of workers overall at Slack are women at a time when women outnumber men in the US population, 45 percent of Slack managers are female. The company says that 41 percent of all people working at Slack report to a female manager. That’s way ahead of the industry average of 18 percent, according to data compiled by The Verge. (An interesting tidbit: Erica Baker, the ex-Google employee who tweeted about pay inequality at Google, now works at Slack as an engineer.) Slack, of course, has much work ahead of it before it achieves true workforce equality. It could stand to make its goals more transparent and hold itself accountable to the public the way Pinterest, Intel, and Twitter have done. Its employees are still overwhelmingly white, and it could stand to hire more women engineers—18 percent of its engineers are female, better than Facebook, Twitter, and Microsoft, according to data gathered by The Wall Street Journal, but not as good as Intel (20 percent) and Apple (22 percent). Still, starting early has its advantages: It means Slack can stay light-footed before it becomes too big to change. Now, it just has to double down and really make those changes. Go Back to Top.

The decision is an odd one for the company, which has recently made a highly publicized push to diversify the STEM field, pledging $300 million to the cause. The Science Talent Search, which has seen a massive increase in the number of female finalists over the years, according to one study, would appear to be an effective way to foster that diversity. But Intel spokesperson Gail Dundas says the company views those initiatives as distinct. “We’re doing a lot of work in the diversity space, which is wide ranging, but it’s separate from this,” she says. Intel’s contract with the Talent Search is set to expire in 2017, and that, Dundas says, is the reason the sponsorship won’t continue. Asked why Intel isn’t renewing that contract, Dundas declined to elaborate. “It’s a long term sponsorship,” she said. “It’s 20 years. That’s really all I have to say on that.” Which doesn’t really clear up anything about this weird move. All of this raises more questions than it answers, chief among them being whether this was an ill-conceived cost-cutting measure that’s now turned into a public relations failure. But since the sponsorship cost Intel only about $6 million a year, even that explanation makes little sense, considering the company brought in $55.6 billion last year, according to the New York Times. On the bright side, there’s now room for a younger, dare we say more relevant, tech player to take on the job. Any takers? Go Back to Top.

But if you look at the numbers, their goals aren’t all that, well, progressive. “We want the makeup of our company to reflect the vast range of people who use Twitter,” Janet Van Huysse, Twitter’s vice president of diversity and inclusion, explains in a blog post. “Doing so will help us build a product to better serve people around the world.” Twitter Twitter says it wants to increase the number of women in the company overall to 35 percent, with women in tech roles reaching 16 percent and those in leadership roles reaching 25 percent. Similarly, the company wants to increase the number of underrepresented minorities on its staff in the US to 11 percent overall, with underrepresented minorities reaching at least 9 percent in tech roles and 6 percent for leadership roles. While the company’s efforts will hopefully lead to more transparency when it comes to the number of women and underrepresented minorities it hires and promotes, the goals themselves are pretty incremental. As it stands now, the company already has 34 percent women on its staff, with 13 percent in tech roles and 22 percent in leadership roles—not too far off from its goals. With 4,100 employees worldwide currently, the difference would be adding at least 41 women to reach its overall gender goal (though it would depend on the company’s growth). And yet it does seem that, when it comes to diversity at tech companies, change happens slowly. Despite their efforts, both Google and Facebook only saw incremental improvements in the diversity of their staff in the past year. Google, for example, only increased the number of women in technical roles by 1 percent. Facebook saw the number of women at the company increase by 1 percent overall, but it saw no change in the percentage of black employees. Twitter may be playing it safe, by setting goals it actually hopes it can keep. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. diversity twitter Skip Social. Skip to: Latest News.

The group’s latest effort? A House of Cards spoof comparing Netflix’s discriminatory policies to, well, the ruthless manipulation and politics of series protagonist Frank Underwood. Earlier this month, Netflix announced that it would offer new moms and dads a full-year of paid parental leave. The decision was met with cheers from parents and the press, but it soon became clear that the new policy does not apply to all employees. Only the company’s more highly paid “salaried streaming employees” could take the time off. For UltraViolet, this is discriminatory. “People are taking notice that Netflix is expecting praise for extending parental leave to its higher-paid employees, yet it doesn’t extend those benefits to the hourly employees who need it most,” Nita Chaudhary, cofounder of UltraViolet, said in a statement. “It’s important that Netflix set an example for the rest of employers and companies nationwide… by giving all employees equal benefits.” Netflix, on the other hand, defends its policies. “Across Netflix, we compare salary and benefits to those of employees at businesses performing similar work,” a company spokesperson said in a statement. “Those comparisons show we provide all of our employees with comparable or better pay and benefits than at other companies.” After Netflix announced its new policy, other tech companies, like Microsoft and Adobe, chimed in with their own expanded parental leave offerings. These polices can serve as a way to attract more diverse talent. But sometimes, at least publicly, they can backfire. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article.

The company said today it will now provide new parents with 12 weeks of paid leave. Birth mothers will also keep the eight weeks of paid maternity disability leave they already have, for a total of 20 weeks, Microsoft executive vice president of human resources Kathleen Hogan said in a blog post. Microsoft will also allow birth mothers to take two weeks off prior to their due dates. The company says all new parents can choose whether to take their leave in one continuous chunk or split the time into two separate periods. New parents will also be able to phase back into work on a half-time basis. “As we ask our employees to bring their ‘A’ game to work every day to achieve our mission, we believe it’s our responsibility to create an environment where people can do their best work. A key component of this is supporting our employees with benefits that matter most to them,” Hogan writes. Microsoft also said it was adding paid holidays for all employees as well as increasing 401(k) deferred matches. The extended parental leave announcement comes one day after Netflix said it will offer new moms and dads “unlimited leave” for one year after the birth of a new child or adoption. Both plans show an apparent commitment to offering more fair and equitable benefits to their employees as top tech companies vie to attract top talent. Go Back to Top.

In fact, it now says they can take as much time as they want. The video streaming giant announced a new policy today that offers unlimited maternity and paternity leave to employees for the first year after a child’s birth or adoption. “We want employees to have the flexibility and confidence to balance the needs of their growing families without worrying about work or finances,” Netflix’s chief talent officer Tawni Cranz explains in a statement. “Parents can return part-time, full-time, or return and then go back out as needed. We’ll just keep paying them normally, eliminating the headache of switching to state or disability pay.” The new policy is consistent with Netflix’s larger mandate that employees should be free to figure out their own work-life balance as responsible and accountable adults. The company already offers unlimited time off to all employees; now it’s explicitly adding unlimited maternity and paternity leave. Unlimited leave, however, can come with its own complications. Without a clear policy, employees may feel they need to take less time off in order to work the same hours as their colleagues or to appeal to their managers. Others might opt not to take any at all. At the same time, US law only requires that eligible new parents who have been at a company for a certain time be provided 12 weeks of unpaid leave. Compared to companies that offer limited time off to new mothers or no paid paternity leave at all to new fathers, Netflix’s policy seems to show a commitment to treating their employees equally and fairly.

Today, the company unveiled new programs designed to improve diversity in its ranks, and the plan looks rather promising. By next year, Pinterest hopes to have more full-time engineer positions filled by women and underrepresented ethnic backgrounds, by increasing the hiring rate for full-time engineering roles to 30% female and to 8% underrepresented minorities. It plans to increase the hiring rate for non-engineering roles to 12% for underrepresented minorities. And the company says it will work to ensure that at least one woman and one underrepresented background candidate is interviewed for every open leadership role. To get there, Pinterest plans to expand the group of universities from which it recruits and launch intern programs for students from underrepresented backgrounds. “Over the past year we learned when we double down on a particular area—like hiring women out of college—we see movement,” the company said in a statement. The company is also setting up an “Inclusion Labs” with Paradigm, a strategy firm focused on diversity, to experiment with better ways to create a more diverse staff. They will offer a workshop on unconscious bias, host events like Blacks in Tech and Future Female Founders, change hiring practices that may put some candidates at a disadvantage, and continue to collect better data. While several tech giants, such as Google, Facebook, and Microsoft, have publicly shared their diversity numbers—largely driven after Pinterest engineer Tracy Chou began collecting numbers about women in tech in 2013—not all that much has changed. But Pinterest thinks that with specific goals and programs it can finally move the needle. “Despite new initiatives tech companies are putting in to place, they have showed virtually no progress or movement,” Reverend Jesse L. Jackson, Sr., said in a statement. “Pinterest’s approach stands in stark contrast, combining aspiration with concrete measurable intention, and is one that other companies would do well to emulate.” Go Back to Top.

But the company insists it’s pushing hard for change. Today, the social network published a series of anti-bias training videos online, which it hopes will help all sorts of companies address the problem of the lack of diversity in tech. Unconscious bias training has become fashionable among tech giants like Google and Facebook. The thinking is: in order to attract diverse talent from outside the organization, it’s critical to promote and foster diversity within the organization. As Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg wrote in a press release announcing the decision: “Managing bias can help us build stronger, more diverse and inclusive companies—and drive better business results. At Facebook, we’ve worked with leading researchers to develop a training course that helps people recognize how bias can affect them, and gives them tools to interrupt and correct for bias when they see it in the workplace.” The problem is: not all companies have the time or resources to develop this type of in-depth training. By putting their courses online, Facebook stands to make it easier for other companies to start similar programs, while also positioning itself as a leader in its diversity efforts, even though it clearly still has a lot to learn.

 This startup is bringing Apple's newest programming world together with one of its oldest Matt Weinberger Aug. 26, 2016, 1:34 PM 3,295 facebook linkedin twitter email print PerfectlySoft CEO Sean StephensPerfectlySoft Over the last two years, Apple has quietly but steadily made big progress with Swift, its super-popular programming language for iPhone apps, lauded as both faster and more elegant than anything else out there. It's definitely Apple's most visible play around appealing to developers. But it's not its first: Since 1987, wholly-owned Apple subsidiary FileMaker has been selling database software to help make it easy for small businesses to make their own apps for computers, the web, and more recently, smartphones. And while it lacks the new shine of Swift, FileMaker has quietly built a solid, millions-strong customer base for itself over the decades, with Apple pushing FileMaker to local businesses from its retail stores. But here's the thing: Despite the fact that Swift and FileMaker both carry the Apple pedigree, there was no way to use the two together — effectively barring Apple's FileMaker customers from moving towards Swift as they continued to build out their smartphone apps.  This is where a startup called PerfectlySoft comes in. Today, PerfectlySoft announces that their flagship product Perfect, which allows Swift to run on servers as well as it does on the iPhone, gets a free FileMaker integration. Apps made with the FileMaker Pro tool.FileMaker "It could really pull FileMaker into the iOS world," says PerfectlySoft CEO Sean Stephens. "Now, you can use Apple's entire ecosystem." It's a small move that could have a big impact on Apple's plan to make Swift "the major language for the next 20 years of programming in our industry," as Apple VP Craig Federighi put it in 2015. The importance of Swift everywhere Here's how building a Swift app works, out of the box. First, you write your app. Then, if you want to have your app synchronize data with a server somewhere on the internet — and name a modern app that doesn't — you need to put Swift away, and pull out a language like Python or PHP to write the so-called "server-side" portion of your app. That means that if you want to use Swift, you need two kinds of experts on your team: One, to write the app, and a second to handle the server stuff. That's fine if you're, say, Lyft, which can employ a dozen or so programmers on each side even as it moves to embrace Swift.  But it's less great if you're FileMaker's ideal audience of small businesses. Which is why integrating the two is so important, Stephens says. Apple VP Craig FederighiAP "FileMaker developers would be foolish to learn PHP, but genius to learn Swift," Stephens says. Which is to say, by using the Perfect integration, a developer can take their databases from FileMaker, use Swift to build an application around it, and then keep using Swift to build the server stuff, too. You only have to be an expert in the one thing. And as FileMaker developers increasingly take their existing web apps and bring them to the iPhone, in line with modern trends, it gives them the option to use Swift, which is definitely looking like the wave of the future in programming of all kinds. Swift opportunity That's a big opportunity for PerfectlySoft in particular, given that Apple hasn't really shown many signs of wanting to bring FileMaker and its millions of customers closer to the cutting edge of technology. "They haven't really made it an obvious part of their strategy," Stephens says. Ultimately, Stephens sees this move as just another way that Swift is going to get everywhere and be everywhere, on all devices. Apple is expected to officially launch the third version of Swift very soon, which will open the doors to letting developers write apps on Windows, PCs, and Android phones, as well as Macs and iPhones. From there, Swift is poised to take over the world. And by making it more accessible to everyone, PerfectlySoft sees it as paving the way for Apple's success. "It really is a huge opportunity for Apple," Stephens says. "I think we provide a big part of that opportunity."

Researchers at Lookout mobile security firm and Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto said they uncovered a fierce, three-pronged cyber attack targeting a dissident's iPhone "that subverts even Apple's strong security environment." Lookout and Citizen Lab worked with Apple on an iOS patch to defend against what was called "Trident" because of its triad of attack methods, the researchers said in a joint blog post. Researchers at Lookout mobile security firm and Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto said they uncovered a fierce, three-pronged cyber attack targeting a dissident's iPhone "that subverts even Apple's strong security environment" ©Josh Edelson (AFP/File) "We were made aware of this vulnerability and immediately fixed it with iOS 9.3.5," Apple said in a released statement. Trident is used in spyware referred to as Pegasus, which a Citizen Lab investigation showed was made by an Israel-based organization called NSO Group. It was acquired by the US firm Francisco Partners Management six years ago, according to Lookout and Citizen. Lookout referred to Pegasus as the most sophisticated attack it has seen, sneakily accessing calls, cameras, email, passwords, apps and more on iPhones. The spyware was detected when used against Ahmed Mansoor, a human rights activist in the United Arab Emirates, who has been repeatedly targeted using spyware. - Phishing scheme - After receiving a suspicious text with a link, he reported the matter to Citizen Lab, which worked in conjunction with San Francisco-based Lookout to research the affair. "The attack sequence, boiled down, is a classic phishing scheme: send text message, open web browser, load page, exploit vulnerabilities, install persistent software to gather information," the joint blog post said. "This, however, happens invisibly and silently, such that victims do not know they’ve been compromised." Mansoor received text messages on August 10 and 11 promising that secrets about detainees being tortured in UAE jails could be accessed by clicking on an enclosed link, researchers said. Had he fallen for the ruse, the Trident chain of "zero-day exploits" would have broken into his iPhone and installed snooping software. Once infected, Mansoor's iPhone would have been turned into a "spy in his pocket" capable of tracking his whereabouts and conversations, Citizen Lab said. Mansoor was targeted five years ago with FinFisher spyware and again the following year with Hacking Team spyware, according to Citizen Lab research. "The use of such expensive tools against Mansoor shows the lengths that governments are willing to go to target activists," the researchers said. Although the cyber attack on Mansoor was not linked to a specific government, Citizen Lab said indicators pointed to the UAE. UAE authorities did not comment on the matter. Lookout and Citizen believe the spyware has been "in the wild for a significant amount of time." "It is also being used to attack high-value targets for multiple purposes, including high-level corporate espionage on iOS, Android and Blackberry." Citizen Lab has also found evidence that "state-sponsored actors" used NSO weapons against a Mexican journalist who reported on high-level corruption in that country and on an unknown target in Kenya. The NSO tactics included impersonating sites such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, the British government's visa application processing website, and a wide range of news organizations and major technology companies, the researchers said. - Cyber arms dealers - Mansoor's decision to enlist Citizen Lab instead of falling into the trap gave researchers a rare chance to expose the work of "shady cyber arms dealers" who command high prices for morally questionable services, Lookout vice president of security research Mike Murray told AFP. Invoices posted online have shown that hackers can charge tens of thousands of dollars per target hit with their software. "The smartphone is a valuable target, and breaking into it is a valuable skill set," Murray said. "People who can do this, and with wiggle room in their moral code, have realized the business opportunity." NSO Group has been around since 2010 and the capture of one of its weapons was billed as a first. Studying Trident has helped cyber defenders find ways to spot spyware that had been operating unseen, and they are "actively catching it in the wild now," Murray said. He declined to reveal anything about other targets, saying that they were people likely to be under surveillance in other ways by local authorities. Citizen Lab saw the attack on Mansoor as further evidence that "lawful intercept" spyware has significant abuse potential, and that some governments can't resist the temptation to use such tools against political opponents, journalists and human rights defenders.

Finance Search Apple issues update after security flaws laid bareBy Glenn Chapman | AFP – Fri, Aug 26, 2016 5:37 PM AEST Related Content View Photo Researchers at Lookout mobile security firm and Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto said they uncovered a fierce, three-pronged cyber attack targeting a dissident's iPhone "that subverts even Apple's strong security environment" Owners of Apple mobile gadgets on Friday were being urged to install a quickly released security update to fix flaws exposed by a sophisticated attack on an Emirati dissident. The California-based iPhone maker released a new version of its mobile operating system, iOS 9.3.5, on Thursday, saying in a post that it doesn't confirm security issues until they are investigated and patched. Researchers at Lookout mobile security firm and Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto said they uncovered a fierce, three-pronged cyber attack targeting a dissident's iPhone "that subverts even Apple's strong security environment." Lookout and Citizen Lab worked with Apple on an iOS patch to defend against what was called "Trident" due to its triad of attack methods, the researchers said in a joint blog post. Trident is used in spyware referred to as Pegasus, which a Citizen Lab investigation showed was made by an Israel-based organization called NSO Group. NSO Group was acquired by US firm Francisco Partners Management six years ago, according to Lookout and Citizen. Lookout referred to Pegasus as the most sophisticated attack it has seen, sneakily accessing calls, cameras, email, passwords, apps and more on iPhones. The spyware was detected when used against Ahmed Mansoor, a human rights activist in the United Arab Emirates, who has been repeatedly targeted using spyware. - Phishing scheme - After receiving a suspicious text with a link, he reported the matter to the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab which worked in conjunction with San Francisco-based Lookout to research the affair. "The attack sequence, boiled down, is a classic phishing scheme: send text message, open web browser, load page, exploit vulnerabilities, install persistent software to gather information," the joint blog post said. "This, however, happens invisibly and silently, such that victims do not know they?ve been compromised." Mansoor received text messages on August 10 and 11 promising that secrets about detainees being tortured in UAE jails could be accessed by clicking on an enclosed link, researchers said. Had he fallen for the ruse, the Trident chain of "zero-day exploits" would have broken into his iPhone and installed sophisticated spy software. Mansoor was targeted five years ago with FinFisher spyware and again the following year with Hacking Team spyware, according to Citizen Lab research. "The use of such expensive tools against Mansoor shows the lengths that governments are willing to go to target activists," researchers said. The cyber attack on Mansoor was not linked to a specific government. UAE authorities did not comment on the matter. Lookout and Citizen believe that the spyware has been "in the wild for a significant amount of time." "It is also being used to attack high-value targets for multiple purposes, including high-level corporate espionage on iOS, Android, and Blackberry." Citizen Lab has also found evidence that "state-sponsored actors" used NSO cyber weapons against a Mexican journalist who reported on high-level corruption in that country and on an unknown target in Kenya. The NSO Group tactics included impersonating sites such as the International Committee for the Red Cross; the British government's visa application processing website, and a wide range of news organizations and major technology companies, according to researchers.

(Thinkstock photo) By Jolene Thym, correspondent PUBLISHED: August 26, 2016 at 3:56 am | UPDATED: September 5, 2016 at 4:15 pm Ask any kid: The star of the lunchbox is that sweet, chewy bar that’s a little bit nutritious, and a lot like dessert. Made with grain, fruit, nuts, soy or seeds, snack bars are incredibly popular. Store shelves are jammed with dozens of choices for every age group. Some are large, protein-packed bars clearly made for adult appetites. Others are small, nutrient-dense bars perfect for kids on the go. This taste-off focuses on the latter, bars for the lunchbox that include grains, not just fruit and nuts. Since peanuts and candy are often banned at schools, we’ve steered clear here, as well. Snackbars are made many of the same ingredients — oats, nuts, seeds, dried fruit — but the results vary wildly. There are soft bars and chewy bars, crisp ones, nutty, seedy, chunky and even bars that look like cookie dough. Some are loaded with calories due to generous amounts of nuts and seeds. Those lower in calories tend to have higher grain content. The primary issues with these bars are sugar content, flavor and texture. The best are minimally sweet, chewy rather than dry, and loaded with layers of fresh flavors. The worst are stale, pasty, sugar bombs masquerading as healthy lunchbox treats. Here’s the scoop on 15 varieties available at local stores. Curate Kids Apple & Cinnamon Fresh bits of dried apple and a hint of cinnamon make this a top choice for kids of all ages. 160 calories, 7 g fat, 9 g sugar, 4 g protein. $3.50 on sale for five 1.23-ounce bars at Target. 4 stars Pamela’s Whenever Bars Gluten-Free Oat Blueberry Lemon More like a cookie than a granola bar, these tender, moist bars are packed with fruit and grains, and deliver lots of fresh flavor. 170 calories, 7 g fat, 10 g sugar, 2 g protein. $4.99 for five 1.41-ounce bars at Whole Foods. 4 stars 18 Rabbits Jr. Organic Caramel Apple Chewy oats and a dose of caramel make this mini-bar a fun, not-too-decadent treat for the younger set. 120 calories, 3 g fat, 8 g sugar, 2 g protein. $4.99 for six 1.05-ounce bars at Target. Also terrific: the larger 1.6-ounce bars, which are lower in sugar. 4 stars Kind Oats & Honey This chewy, but moist bar is a bit ordinary, but it hits all the right notes. It’s sweet, salty and fresh. 150 calories, 5 g fat, 6 g sugar, 2 g protein. $2.99 for five 1.2-ounce bars at Target. 3 ½ stars Trader Joe’s Organic Chia Bar Black chia and green pumpkin seeds may not look appetizing, but this chewy, crunchy bar has great nutty flavor, with a sprinkle of salt for the win. 100 calories, 5 g fat, 4 g sugar, 3 g protein. $2.99 for five 0.9-ounce bars. 3 ½ stars Pure Ancient Grains Vanilla Almond Bar Compact in size and packed with protein, these oat-free bars have layers of flavor, thanks to the blend of grains, seeds and nuts. 150 calories, 7 g fat, 6 g sugar, 4 g protein. $15.19 for a dozen 1.23-ounce bars on Amazon. 3 stars Trader Joe’s Raises the Bar Chewy Granola A bold splash of maple wakes up this multigrain bar, which combines the usual oats with millet, quinoa, amaranth, buckwheat and pumpkin seeds. 140 calories, 4 g fat, 6 g sugar, 3 g protein. $2.79 for five 1.2-ounce bars. 3 stars Made Good Mixed Berry Granola Bars Sweetened with agave and brown rice syrup, these slightly too sweet, sticky bars have rich flavor and extra vitamins thanks to a dash of vegetable powder. 80 calories, 2 g fat, 7 g sugar, 1 g protein. $4.49 for six 0.85-ounce bars at Whole Foods. 2 ½ stars Enjoy Life Baked Chewy Bars Those who like the cookie-dough texture of ground grains and fruit may appreciate these slightly pasty, oat-free, gluten-free bars. 110 calories, 2.5 g fat, 8 g sugar, 1 g protein. $3 for five 1-ounce bars at Target. 2 ½ stars Nature’s Path Envirokidz Berry Blast Crispy Rice Bars Fans of Rice Krispy treats may enjoy the crunch-factor of these slightly dry treats. There’s not much flavor, but young eaters may like them. 110 calories, 3 g fat, 6 g sugar, 1 g protein. six 1-ounce bars at Sprouts. 2 stars This Kid Saves Lives Wild Berries Old oats and zero berry flavor quash what could have been a decent bar. 120 calories, 2 g fat, 8 g sugar, 2 g protein. $4.99 for five 1.13-ounce bars at Target. 1 star Simply Balanced Apple Berry Chewy Granola These bars are crazy dry and lack flavor, but at least they’re cheap. 90 calories, 1.5 g fat, 8 g sugar, 1 g protein. $2.15 for eight 0.8-ounce bars at Target. 1 star Clif Kid Organic Z Bar Iced Oatmeal Cookie Disappointingly sweet and pasty, these bars lack texture, flavor and just about anything else you’d expect in a grain bar. 140 calories, 4 g fat, 12 g sugar, 2 g protein. $3 for six 1.2-ounce bars at Whole Foods. ½ a star Annie’s Organic Chewy Oatmeal Raisin Dried-out flakes of oatmeal pressed together with a sweet paste make for an unappealing, unappetizing bar. 90 calories, 1.5 g fat, 8 g sugar, 1 g protein. $3.49 for six 0.89-ounce bars at Whole Foods. ½ a star Quaker Chewy Oatmeal Raisin Yes, the oatmeal is fresh, but these are wickedly sweet. Sugar is the first and last flavor. $2 for eight 0.84-ounce bars at Target. No stars Reviews are based on product samples purchased by this newspaper or provided by manufacturers.

That’s according to the New York Times, which reported this week that Spotify has a new policy in place to put less promotion muscle behind albums that were given to other services on an exclusive basis before. Spotify may, for example, decide against featuring such albums on its service, or include their songs in fewer playlists. (Spotify didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.) This comes after the latest of a string of releases that shunned Spotify in favor of exclusive deals with Apple Music or TIDAL. The latest: Frank Ocean’s new album “Blonde” appeared exclusively on Apple Music last week. It’s Ocean’s first album in four years, with a twist. Just days before releasing “Blonde,” Ocean released a 46-minute music video dubbed “Endless” that has been called a “visual album” by the artist, and is also an Apple Music exclusive. Related Spotify and Major Labels Wrangle Again Over Ad-Supported Listening, Royalties Apple has gotten a few popular albums on an exclusive basis in the past, while other artists have instead tied the knot with Jay Z’s Tidal streaming service. Beyoncé, Drake, Rihanna, Kanye West and others all have done these kinds of exclusive deals, which often promise artists more income than regular streaming royalties. Spotify has thus far stayed away from exclusive deals, with executives arguing that they don’t benefit music fans or record labels. Lady Gaga’s former manager Troy Carter, who joined Spotify as a high-profile artist liaison this summer,  reiterated that point this week, telling Billboard that “exclusives are bad for artists, bad for consumers and bad for the whole industry.” Carter also used to interview to reveal that Spotify now has more than 39 million paying subscribers, up from 30 million in March. This suggests that thus far, exclusives to competing services haven’t hurt Spotify’s growth. The major record labels, which own minor stakes in the streaming service, want to keep it that way. Universal Music chairman Lucian Grainge pinned an internal memo this week that called for an end to long-term exclusives, according to the Times. However, some artists may beg to differ, and Apple’s deep coffers may make it easier for them to do so. Case in point: Frank Ocean released “Blonde” independently, splitting with his former label Universal and instead banking on up-front money from Apple.

Pete Marriott says: August 26, 2016 at 3:50 pm Spotify’s membership may be up, but that doesn’t mean that their daily usage is doing just as well. The real reason these artists are making such deals with Apple is because the low royalty rate Spotify pays them does not make business sense. Sure the record label might have a good deal, but the artists get screwed by Spotify every time. Apple Music has won me over because they are doing more than just curated playlists. Apple has reinvented radio programming through great specialty mix-shows such as Q-Tip’s ‘Abstract Radio’, ‘Selection’ and ‘Dr. Dre’s Pharmacy’. You also have to factor in the technological component of being able to access Apple Music with your iPhone, iPad and MacBook quickly. Spotify is a slow, outdated, boring and sometimes cumbersome platform. Maybe if they spent more money developing their technology and less effort on finding new ways of ripping off the artists and create a culture of decency, they wouldn’t have to cry about why impactful artists like Frank Ocean is hurting their feelings… Reply Julian says: August 31, 2016 at 3:49 pm Artists don’t get screwed by Spotify. Artists make deals with record labels, record labels make deals with Spotify. It’s the record label’s decision (and the artists ability to negotiate) how much the artist gets paid before the release and for download/streaming numbers. I personally like the Spotify playlists and some audiobooks. I hate these exclusive release; I don’t believe that artists like Frank Ocean or Taylor Swift aren’t getting paid enough by their record labels already.

Cannaccord Genuity recently compiled operating margins for all major smartphone OEMs, and compared them to the company’s mobile device margins. What is discovered is that Apple is the most profitable with a 38 percent margin for smartphones. 30,000 tech-heads descend on Amsterdam Join us and 30,000 others at the 12th edition of TNW Conference. Explore our speakers and attendees now. TELL ME MORE! Samsung is also highly profitable with a 17 percent mobile device operating margin. Other notables — not so much. Both HTC and Microsoft run at a 22 percent loss in their mobile divisions. Even LG, which has some of the best Android handsets around, has a five percent loss. Lenovo, which recently purchased Motorola to help turn its flailing smartphone business around, runs on a 10 percent loss. Perhaps most interesting is Cannaccord’s long-term view. These figures represent the current fiscal quarter, but it wasn’t the case this time last year. LG’s mobile division was profitable or breaking even at the beginning of 2015, and losses from HTC were much less alarming. Cannaccord notes its not comprehensive, but any OEMs left off the list was purposeful “due to the lack of available and comparable profit metrics.” But it’s still an honest, unbiased look at what’s really happening beneath the flashy ad campaigns and announcement events. It’s also hard to argue that a company like HTC should continue its current path.

It’s worth repeating that iOS 10 beta 8 for developers and iOS 10 beta 7 for public beta testers contain the same features. The devices on a prior beta can be updated in Settings → General → Software Update, but some users are reporting issues trying to update to beta 8. Upon invoking iOS’s Software Update feature, some users see a prompt, saying “Unable to Check for Update. En error occurred while checking for a software update.” Developers can download the full iOS 10 beta 8 installer via Apple’s Dev Center. Speaking of new betas, Apple also released tvOS 10 beta 7 today. With public release of iOS 10 just a few weeks away, you shouldn’t expect any major feature changes or enhancements aside from bug fixes. And as we inch closer to a Golden Mater candidate, each new iOS 10 beta has become faster and more stable. Share: Tweet Follow: Follow @iDownloadBlog We Recommend Apple launches beta 2 of iOS 10.2.1 and macOS Sierra 10.12.3 Apple seeds iOS 10.2 beta 7 to developers Apple seeds iOS 10.1 beta 5 for iPhone 7/Plus to developers and public beta testers Apple seeds iOS 10.1 beta 4 to developers and public beta testers Related Topics Apple, Beta, Developers, iOS, iOS 10, iOS 10 beta 8, iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch, News, Public Beta [RECON1] Looks like Public Beta is downloading just fine.

[RECON1] Did someone call for me? Steve Harvey Apple is just like to-mator! besrate hogsa Golden Master? Raymond Lanser Of all the major release iOS versions I’ve beta tested (the last 4, some as developer) this is the most bug riddled version this close to release, with bugs I reported 4 versions ago. This is besides how aesthetically terrible apps are becoming (music app I’m looking at you). The beginning of the end for Apple imo, especially when a main feature is gimmicks in the messaging app that look terrible and are meekly implemented. John Smith That’s because the design team is filled with a bunch of self-centered “entrepreneurs” rather than people who take their job seriously. It’s slowly turning into a tumblr machine just like people used to mock the Macbook for being an expensive “facebook machine”. besrate hogsa It is an expensive face book machine Windows 10 FTW John Smith Screw Shitdows 10. #WindowsSe7en besrate hogsa windows7 was okay and it WAS better than mac OS but win10 is way better John Smith Mate MacOS Cheetah is better than Windows 10. And that’s saying a lot. ck125 I hate windows 10 on my work laptop. Windows 8 was much more solid for me. Shadowelite123 Ehh Windows 10 is alright. Not really great. leart why so pessimistic lol… iOS 10 looks fantastic to me 🙂 Raymond Lanser As a graphic designer I can’t help notice a bunch of just sloppy work. It just seems rushed and under developed to me. Apple is supposed to be a company that releases products when they’re done right, not because they can or because of market trends. Added steps to UX experience, overlapping design elements, unnecessarily large fonts that don’t add to legibility (and making some elements larger that, while visually more impactful, decrease functionality and experience), and just a basic lack of consistency in elements across apps. Not saying there aren’t things I like, but I miss the refined done right hard line stance of apple before Cook I guess. leart im a senior designer lol 🙂 but not in america… I worked for 6.5 years in DDB here in my country .. still I’m not good in writing in english… so I can’t argue in a decent way … so I will agree with you Shadowelite123 Gee man I didn’t realize every designer had the same style. Raymond Lanser Style is independent of a design solution. If you can’t work your style to fit a design within a brand’s visual language, you’re a shitty designer. It means you’re a one trick (or visual style) pony that can’t actually design so much as reproduce a style endlessly. You work as a team, develop one visual language, and implement it across a platform, not design each app depending on the whim and style of whosever’s hands are touching it. Gerald Qato iiii!!! T kam par t komentosh te iphonealbania leart 😉 ck125 Agree. The past 2 betas have actually been worse for me than previous betas. My battery was really tanking the last week or so out of nowhere. I submitted various bug issues and most seem to still be around. Raymond Lanser Yeah, same on the battery front. A lot of little bugs in mail, contacts, messages, and clock as well for me. Nothing big, but with that many noticeable ones this far out… ck125 Agree. Kind of worrying to have this many bugs 7/8 betas out. Especially with the event being rumored for a few weeks, hopefully they get these issues fixed. Matt Perkins Can’t help but wonder if this update was released to patch similar vulnerabilities that were patched in iOS 9.3.5 seeing how quickly it was released after iOS 9.3.5 ck125 Apparently the beta before this patched that, at least according to imore. Carlos B Is this the most beta builds we’ve seen in an iOS version? Jose Rivera Nope! iOS 5 had 8 betas so iOS 10 is in a tie with it right now. If we see another or two more, than iOS 10 will take the crown as the OS with the most betas ever. I even wondered if iOS 10 was the one with the most betas too… LOL zebonaut 8 Beta’s and no jailbreak. iFlasher No one is going to release a jailbreak for a beta release. Shadowelite123 Its been done before. Michael Is there a setting that prevents notifications from showing on the lock screen when on a phone call now? I can’t figure out how to change this but it sure is annoying when the phone just flashes or vibrates but it doesn’t tell me why and I have to unlock it to find out.   Search Connect with iDownloadBlog Facebook Become a fan RSS Get the latest news YouTube Watch Us Twitter Stay up to date Newsletter News delivered to you Google+ Add us to your circle   The most recent headlines Beautiful iPhone 7 photos show New Year’s Eve celebrations around the world The best VR apps and games available on the App Store right now Happy New Year firework wallpapers Jailbreak tweaks of the week: CCLowPower, CCRecord, Evanesco, & more… The top stories of the week on iDB   The latest jailbreak news Jailbreak tweaks of the week: CCLowPower, CCRecord, Evanesco, & more… CCLowPower adds a Low Power Mode toggle to Control Center ForceInPicture enables Picture in Picture mode on unsupported devices CCRecord: a tweak to quickly and easily record your iPhone screen Customize your iOS 10 Control Center toggle colors with Cream 2 and Creamless iDownloadBlog           iDownloadblog.com About About Advertise Contact Keep in Touch Twitter Facebook RSS Feed Newsletter Push Notifications Podcasts Let's Talk iOS Let's Talk Jailbreak Site Stuff Disclosure Privacy Policy   Copyright iDownloadBlog 2017.

Apple may need to contend with a supply shortage of the soon-to-be-released new model of its iPhone during the first round of the rollout, due to problems with faulty components… “If Apple sticks to its launch schedule from last year, there may not be enough supply at the beginning, as some suppliers are still trying to fix low yield rates of their components,” an industry source familiar with the issue said. The report noted that Apple told suppliers to drop “up to 15% compared with last year” for its processors. Analyst speculation says demand for iPhone displays are also dropping. “Apple’s panel orders for new iPhones are dropping around 20% year-over-year, and that leaves major suppliers such as Japan Display hungry for more orders.” With that said, analyst have pointed to much lower iPhone shipment estimates for Apple’s next-generation iPhone expected next month.

(Photo: Stephen Lam/ Getty Images) This week marks the fifth anniversary of Tim Cook’s appointment as permanent CEO at Apple — he was appointed CEO on August 24th, 2011. As a result, we’ll no doubt see quite a few retrospectives this week looking back over his time at Apple, and evaluating his tenure. As context for that analysis, I wanted to share some numbers about Apple in the quarter and year before he took over, and compare it with numbers for the quarter and year ending in June of this year. Not all the applicable data sets go back that far — Apple has changed its reporting segments in at least a couple of ways during this five year period, but we’ll mostly try to compare before and after as closely as possible. Note: here as in all the analysis on this blog, I use calendar quarters rather than companies’ fiscal quarters for analysis for ease of comprehension by those not familiar with companies’ fiscal calendars — hence, Q2 2016 is the June quarter recently ended and reported. Many of the charts shown here are part of the Apple quarterly deck which is available as part of the Jackdaw Research Quarterly Decks Service, which you can read more about here. The underlying data is also available on a custom basis as either a one-off delivery or a quarterly service — please contact me for more information. P&L measures Let’s start with the corporate income statement. By any measure, Apple is simply a lot larger than it was five years ago. Here are trailing 4-quarter revenues: Trailing 4-quarter revenues (Jackdaw Research) Revenues in the four quarters before Tim Cook was appointed were $100 billion, whereas in the last four quarters they were over $200 billion. However, as you can see from the chart, it hasn’t been an inexorable rise up and to the right. Revenues grew very strongly in that first period, then began to level off somewhat throughout 2012 and 2013, then spiked following the iPhone 6 launch. And of course over the past year revenue growth has been negative for the first time in many years at Apple. The overall effect is still a more than doubling of total revenue, but the current trajectory is negative. As I’ve written previously, I continue to believe that we’ll see a reversal of this trend in the next few quarters as a combination of factors kicks in, but I’m betting Tim Cook would have rather his 5 year anniversary would have fallen either side of this lull instead of in the middle of it. Meanwhile, margins have been up and down over time, with a bump in the early part of Tim Cook’s time at the helm, followed by a drop down to slightly lower levels, a steady rise, and then a drop off again: Trailing 4-quarter margins (Jackdaw Research) The ups and downs here largely correlate to overall growth rates for Apple, with higher revenue growth rates driving higher margins for a time as cost expansion takes a while to catch up with revenue growth, only to fall again as growth slows. On operating and net margin, Apple has ended these five years slightly below where it started, whereas on gross margin it’s in more or less the same place. But it’s worth noting that dollar profits are still way up on where they were, and that’s the metric that Apple and its investors are likely more focused on: Trailing 4-quarter operating income (Jackdaw Research) Yes, there’s the same up-and-down pattern, but again operating income on a twelve-month basis is roughly twice what it was five years ago over the past year. R&D spend has ballooned The only other line from the income statement I want to zero in on is research and development spending, because there’s been a fairly dramatic change here over the past five years. Here’s total R&D spend in dollars on a twelve-month basis, and spending as a percentage of revenue: Trailing 4-quarter R&D spend (Jackdaw Research) Trailing 4-quarter R&D spend as a % of revenues (Jackdaw Research) R&D spend was under $2.5 billion the four quarters before Tim Cook took over, but it was almost $10 billion five years later, a roughly fourfold increase. And that’s not just because Apple’s revenue has grown during that time — R&D has actually grown significantly as a percentage of revenue over the same period, going from just over 2% to just over 4%, or almost doubling as a percentage. That’s interesting, because R&D actually fell fairly consistently as a percentage of revenue during most of Steve Jobs’ second stint as Apple CEO, from a peak of 8% in 2001 and 2002 all the way down to 2% just before Cook took over. That’s largely a function of the massive iPod- and iPhone-driven revenue growth during that period — dollar R&D spend rose from around $400 million a year to over $2 billion a year during the same time period — but it’s interesting to note that Cook has reversed the trend and significantly increased R&D spend even above and beyond the rate at which revenue has grown. Interestingly, that 2 percentage point increase in R&D spend is roughly equal to the 2 percentage point drop in margins during the Tim Cook era. The cash hoard grows The other major corporate financial metric that’s worth a quick look is cash. Apple’s cash and investment assets have grown enormously over the past five years, as the two charts below show: Apple cash metrics (Jackdaw Research) Apple cash metrics (Jackdaw Research) The starting and ending totals are easier to see in the second chart, but the steady growth is perhaps easier to see in the first. Regardless, Apple ended calendar Q2 2011 with a total balance of cash and investments of $76 billion, while it ended Q2 2016 with a balance of $231.5 billion. In other words, it has added over $155 billion to its coffers over this time. Meanwhile, an increasing proportion of this cash and investments has been held overseas — the percentage was 63% five years ago, but was 93% at the end of Q2 2016. Of course, the other cash-related metric worth noting during the first five years of the Cook era is the way Apple has been using that cash to pay dividends and buy back stock. Steve Jobs famously refused to pay dividends, but around a year into his tenure, Tim Cook instituted both these programs to return cash to shareholders. As of April of this year, Apple said it had “returned over $163 billion to shareholders, including $117 billion in share repurchases.” That makes the increase in its overall pile of cash and investments all the more remarkable. Unit shipments are up for iPhone, less so for other products One of the most interesting things to look at in regard to the last five years is what’s happened to unit shipments for Apple’s three major product lines. The long-term trend is shown in this first chart: Trailing 4-quarter unit shipments (Jackdaw Research) Again, we’re all familiar with the trajectory of iPhone sales over recent years, so let’s be brief here. It’s worth noting that Tim Cook’s appointment coincided with the decision to move the launch date for new iPhones from June to the Fall, with the iPhone 4s launching in October of 2011. That explains the flat part at the beginning of the iPhone chart above. Following that shift, though, the iPhone saw strong growth in 2012 and 2013, but began to flatten out, only to spike in late 2014 and into 2015 thanks to the iPhone 6, then slumping a little in late 2015 and the first half of 2016. But again, it’s worth looking at the total numbers here. Apple shipped 69 million iPhones in the four quarters to Q2 2011, and shipped 214 million in the most recent four quarters. That’s a massive expansion of Apple’s business here, despite the recent lull (shipments peaked at 231.5 million on a twelve month basis in Q4 2015). It’s also interesting to note that Apple has shipped 859 million iPhones during the Tim Cook era, compared with just 130 million in the pre-Cook era. In other words, roughly 87% of the almost one billion iPhones Apple has ever sold have been sold during Tim Cook’s time as permanent CEO. What’s almost more interesting, though, is what’s happened to Mac and iPad sales, which performed roughly the same in the most recent quarter as they did five years ago: Unit shipments for three major categories (Jackdaw Research) As you can see, both Mac and iPad sales were up just a few hundred thousand on those from five years earlier, despite the doubling of iPhone sales over the same period. As the earlier chart shows, for iPads that’s because sales first grew significantly, peaking at 26 million quarterly and 74 million over twelve months in Q4 2013 and falling since. Mac sales, too, have had better quarters than the most recent one, though the peak was not much higher than today. Both products are due for something of a rebound in the coming quarters, as new Mac are (hopefully) finally introduced and the iPad Pro trend continues to help sales. And it’s worth noting that 300 of the roughly 330 million total iPads sold to date have been sold under Tim Cook, along with almost 112 million Macs. Of course, we don’t have official shipment numbers for the Apple Watch, though there are various estimates out there. But it would be inappropriate to skip over that product entirely — it was the first brand-new product introduced in the Tim Cook era, and likely sold around 15 million units in its first year on the market. That’s a much faster run-rate than the iPhone, but down a little at this point on iPad sales in their first year. But it’s interesting that, as Tim Cook marks his five year anniversary, we’re seeing another product whose launch timeframe is being moved from the first half to the second half of the year, causing something of a lull in sales in the meantime. A changing mix of segment revenues All that movement in unit shipments obviously flows through to product revenues too. The revenue split by segment has changed fairly significantly over Tim Cook’s tenure. Apple’s financial reporting by segment has also changed over the last five years, with the iPod no longer separated out as its own reporting line, the Accessories bucket being merged with iPod, Apple Watch, Apple into “Other Products” and “iTunes, Software, and Services” becoming just “Services”. In the chart below, I’ve collapsed these segments for comparability: Revenue split by segment (Jackdaw Research) The iPhone, which was already a very significant portion of Apple’s overall revenue, has only become more dominant over the past five years, rising from 45% of revenue in the twelve months to Q2 2011 to 64% in the year to Q2 2016. But other components have also risen or fallen — iPad has dropped from 16% to 9% and Mac from 20% to 11%, while the combination of iPod, accessories, and various other hardware products has dropped quite a bit too. The only other segment that’s risen as a portion of the total during this time — despite the rapid growth of iPhone revenues — is Services. An increase from 9% to 10% of revenue doesn’t look like much, but it’s much more impressive when you look at the dollar amounts instead: Trailing 4-quarter services revenues (Jackdaw Research) What’s now the Services segment has grown from under $10 billion in the twelve months to Q2 2011 to well over $20 billion in the most recent twelve months, with the trajectory actually steepening in recent quarters. Yes, it’s still just 10% of total revenue over the past year, but it’s actually Apple’s fastest-growing segment at the moment. The other interesting thing to look at in the context of segment revenue is the difference between unit shipments and revenue performance, which is driven by changing average selling prices (ASPs). You can see it a little in iPhone revenues: Trailing 4-quarter iPhone revenues (Jackdaw Research) By now, that iPhone trajectory should be familiar, but it’s worth noting the growth — from just over $40 billion on a twelve-month basis to $140 billion. It’s subtle, but the 3.1x growth in shipments has translated into a 3.5x growth in revenue, and that’s largely down to ASPs. Here are average selling prices on a trailing 4-quarter basis for the three major product lines at the beginning and end of Tim Cook’s first five years — note that because of changes in reporting structures I’ve used Q3 rather than Q2 2011 as the starting point here: Trailing 4-quarter revenue per shipment (Jackdaw Research) As you can see, iPhone ASPs have risen over the five years despite the increasing maturity of the product and the introduction of two cheaper models (the iPhone 5c and more recently the iPhone SE). Mac ASPs have dropped, but only slightly, while iPad ASPs have dropped fairly significantly, driven by the launch of the iPad Mini in 2012 and the increasing tendency to keep older devices in the lineup for longer at lower prices. But something interesting has been happening to iPad revenues in recent quarters, even as shipments continue to fall year on year: Trailing 4-quarter iPad revenues (Jackdaw Research) This flattening of revenues, and the growth this past quarter, has been driven by the iPad Pro, which has raised ASPs considerably. iPad ASPs bottomed out at around $415 a year ago, but were $490 in Q2 2016, up $60 from Q1, putting them back at late 2012 levels. Regional trends and the rise of China One of the most dramatic changes at Apple in the Tim Cook era has been the rise of China as one of its two major markets. Here, again, unfortunately, we’re thwarted a little by a change in Apple’s reporting a few years back, in which it eliminated Retail as a separate segment and rolled it into the individual regions, so we’re going to use Q4 rather than Q2 2011 as our starting point, and for comparability we’ll use Q4 2015 as the end point. As such, we’re measuring a four-year rather than five-year period, but the changes are still very visible. Here’s the share of Apple’s revenue by region at those two points in time: Share of Apple revenue by region (Jackdaw Research) As you can see, Greater China has increased massively as a proportion of revenue over this period, going from 10% to 24% of revenues, while every other region has shrunk in percentage terms. In Q4 2015, Greater China contributed the same percentage of revenue as Europe. Looking at the dollar amounts is again helpful — here’s actual revenue by region for those two quarters: Apple revenue by region (Jackdaw Research) It’s worth noting first that every region has grown during these four years, but Greater China has clearly grown far faster than any other region, from $4.5 billion to over $18 billion during this time. That’s massive growth, and I’d say it’s one of Tim Cook’s great achievements during his tenure. It’s also clearly something he hasn’t given up on, given his recent frequent visits to China and the investments in Didi and in an R&D center to be built there. It’s also worth looking at operating income by geography, because here too China has made a significant contribution: Apple segment operating income by region (Jackdaw Research) Retail is far more international I want to close out with Apple’s retail business, which gets less attention in Apple’s official reporting than it used to, since Retail has been wrapped into the regions, but is as important to Apple’s strategy as ever. And Tim Cook has been instrumental in expanding the Retail footprint, especially overseas, though Retail has also been the focal point of arguably Cook’s biggest blunder as CEO — the appointment of John Browett to run the business. However, Angela Ahrendts’ appointment seems to have more than made up for that mistake. Here are a couple of charts about Apple’s retail footprint: % of Apple retail stores in the US and internationally (Jackdaw Research) Apple retail stores by geography (Jackdaw Research) At the end of Q2 2011, Apple had a total of 327 retail stores, of which 236 or 72% were in the US. By the end of Q2 2016, Apple had 488 stores globally, of which 218 or 45% were now overseas. Tim Cook’s time as CEO has seen Apple stores opened in seven new countries across four continents: Number of countries with Apple Retail stores (Jackdaw Research) But of course it’s also seen a massive expansion in the number of Apple stores in China, which had 36 stores as of the end of July, up from single digits when Tim Cook took over. Conclusions I’ve deliberately made this more of a factual post than an evaluation of Tim Cook’s tenure — as I said up front, this week will see lots of this sort of stuff, and I’ve already talked to several reporters doing their best to sum up five years of work in a few hundred words. But I think it’s worth noting several things here, some of which I’ve mentioned in the text: Apple under Tim Cook has sold far more iPhones and iPads than it ever did under Steve Jobs — 87% of total iPhones sold and 90% of iPads ever sold. Though Steve Jobs launched these products, it was always Tim Cook who ensured the supply chain met demand as well as possible, and it’s been Tim Cook who’s overseen the massive expansion in that supply chain over the last five years as the scale has grown to something unprecedented. Tim Cook has made the decision to increase Apple’s spending on research and development not just in dollar terms commensurate with revenue growth but actually doubling it as a percentage of revenue during his tenure despite the massive growth in revenue. That reversed the trend under Steve Jobs, and the increased investment in R&D is roughly equivalent to the drop in margins during this time — Cook has made a massive bet on R&D and by implication on future products. Cook has made China a special focus, and this focus has paid off in a big way, with a roughly fourfold increase in revenue from Greater China and an equivalent increase in operating income. Greater China has grown from 10% of revenues to roughly a quarter, and Apple’s retail footprint there has also grown dramatically. That growth in China has been a major contributor to Apple’s overall growth in the last five years, and Cook clearly remains committed to China as a focus for Apple as evidenced by his recent investments there. He’s begun to talk more about India and its potential, but I remain skeptical that India can be much more than a rounding error for Apple over the next few years. Only one entirely new hardware product has launched under Tim Cook, and yet we have almost no official data to go on to evaluate the performance of the Apple Watch so far. Opinion remains divided about how to evaluate the Watch, but I’m on the side of those who considers it a modest success in Apple terms and a smash hit in the context of the market into which it was launched. Like the iPhone the year Tim Cook took over, it’s going through an interesting transition as its release moves from the first half to the second half of the year, but I suspect that like the iPhone in late 2011, the Watch is due for big growth in late 2016 and beyond. I suspect the transformation we’ve seen in Services, driven largely to date by the App Store and latterly by Apple Music, is just the start of what we’ll see under Tim Cook. He’s already hinted several times at additional services to come, and TV is an obvious focus here. But I also think some of the rhetoric about Services has been overblown — it’s still only 10% of revenue, and unlikely to grow massively past that point unless Apple decouples services from its devices, which I think would be a mistake. Perhaps one of the most significant contributions Tim Cook has made at Apple can’t be seen in any of these charts, because it’s about the changes to Apple’s culture that have happened under his leadership. The increased openness, best exemplified by the frequent interviews Cook and other executives now regularly grant to various publications (and even podcasters), is one element of this, though Apple’s secrecy about future products remains as tight as ever. But an increased sense of social responsibility, especially as regards the environment and contributions to social causes is another major change. This doesn’t have a direct financial impact, but it’s made a positive contribution nonetheless, and no evaluation of Cook’s tenure would be complete without a recognition of that fact.

According to Apple, iOS 10 is the company's biggest iOS update ever released. Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel for more videos. The Messages app in iOS 10 has been overhauled with features that include background animations, bubble effects, Digital Touch, handwritten notes, Tapback replies, predictive emoji, and a dedicated App Store, and Photos has gained new facial and object recognition capabilities along with a Memories feature for rediscovering forgotten moments. iOS 10 is currently available to developers and public beta testers, with a full public release planned for the fall. iOS 10 beta 8 is likely to be the last update before the golden master version is released as Apple will need time to finalize the software before its public launch. For full details on iOS 10, make sure to check out our iOS 10 roundup. Update: Many users appear to be running into an error when attempting to download the new beta, getting an "Unable to Check for Update" popup.

Installing the tvOS beta requires the Apple TV to be connected to a computer with a USB-C to USB-A cable, with the software downloaded and installed via iTunes or Apple Configurator. Once a beta profile has been installed on the device through iTunes, new beta updates will be available over the air. tvOS 10 builds on features initially introduced with tvOS last October, bringing expanded Siri capabilities like topic-based search, Live Tune-In for automatically accessing live channels, and options for managing HomeKit accessories. Single-Sign On allows users to sign in and authenticate cable credentials just once instead of requiring authentication in all cable-supported apps, games are now able to require controllers, and there are new features for Photos and Music. Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel for more videos. A dark mode offers a better visual experience for darker rooms, universal apps are automatically downloaded, and there's a new Apple TV remote for iOS devices that mirrors the Siri Remote. Over the beta testing period, Apple has been making slight tweaks and updates to the tvOS 10 operating system, but many of the changes are under-the-hood and not readily apparent to testers. Any outward-facing changes discovered in the seventh beta, which is likely to be the last beta before the golden master, will be noted below. For a full overview of all of the new features in tvOS 10, make sure to check out our tvOS 10 roundup.

IPhone users are getting another alert for Apple's latest version of its mobile operating system. But cybersecurity experts are urging consumers not to ignore this update, which fixes an unprecedented type of security flaw. Who's eligible Owners of iPhone 4s and later, iPad 2 and later, iPod touch (5th generation) and later can get this update, according to Apple's support website. You should be automatically notified that it's available, or you can update manually using iTunes. Why it matters Apple released iOS 9.3.5 on Thursday to patch three security vulnerabilities, believed to have been used by "digital arms dealers" to spy on dissidents and journalists, according to The New York Times. Apple's patch targets previously unknown spyware that infiltrated iPhones and can read messages, track calls and contacts, record sounds, collect passwords and location information, investigators told the Times. The discovery of the hack is chilling in itself. But what users really need to know is how to make sure they have the latest, safest version on their iPhones. How to update Here are Apple's instructions on how to update, from Apple's support page: Before you update Make a backup of your device using iCloud or iTunes. Update your device wirelessly If a message says that an update is available, tap Install Now. You can also follow these steps: 1. Plug your device into power and connect to the Internet with Wi-Fi. 2. Tap Settings > General > Software Update. 3. Tap Download and Install. If a message asks to temporarily remove apps because iOS needs more space for the update, tap Continue or Cancel. Later, iOS will reinstall apps that it removed. If you tap Cancel, learn what to do next. 4. To update now, tap Install. Or you can tap Later and choose Install Tonight or Remind Me Later. If you tap Install Tonight, just plug your iOS device into power before you go to sleep. Your device will update automatically overnight. 5. If asked, enter your passcode. If you don't know your passcode, learn what to do. If you see an error or need more space when updating wirelessly. If you see an error message while trying to update your device wirelessly, learn what to do. If you need more space for a wireless update, you can update using iTunes or delete content manually from your device. Whether you use iTunes or update wirelessly, you'll have the same amount of free space on your device after you update. Some iOS software updates aren't available wirelessly. VPN or proxy connections might prevent your device from contacting the iOS update servers. Update your device using iTunes If you can't update wirelessly on your iOS device, you can update manually using iTunes on a computer that you trust. If your computer is using Personal Hotspot on the iOS device that you're updating, connect your computer to a different WiFi or Ethernet network before you update. 1. Install the latest version of iTunes on your computer. 2. Connect your device to your computer. 3. Open iTunes and select your device. 4. Click Summary, then click Check for Update. 5. Click Download and Update. If you see error messages in iTunes or need more space to update Get help if you see error messages while updating your device with iTunes. Or if you need more space for an update, you can delete content from your device manually. Make space for that update Yes, it's painful, but you may need to take the time to back up or sift through less-used apps and photos to make room. Apple has some tips on its website, and some other publications do to. Check out the links below.

Happy New Year firework wallpapers The top stories of the week on iDB How to use AirPods like a pro   skip to main content skip to main menu     Intel could begin fabricating iPhone and iPad chips as early as 2018 By Christian Zibreg, Aug 26, 2016 Tweet 8 Comments Both in-house designed ‘A10’ and ‘A11’ chips for this year’s iPhone 7 and 2017 iPhones/iPads, respectively, are believed to be manufactured solely by Taiwan’s semiconductor foundry TSMC (sorry, Samsung). According to Nikkei Asian Review, Intel is now perfectly poised to give TSMC a good run for its money in as little as two years because any Apple chips after the A10/A11 should be fabricated by Intel. The recently signed licensing deal between Intel and UK-based ARM Holdings lets the former fabricate chips for smartphones based on the latter’s CPU technology. LG will become the first handset vendor to adopt Intel-fabbed chips following the ARM deal. According to Gartner’s semiconductor analyst cited in the report, Samuel Wang, A12/A13 chips for 2018/2019 iPhones are expected to be manufactured by Intel: TSMC could face tough competition as soon as 2018 or 2019 as Intel is likely to gain orders from Apple by then. Intel has begun to engage with Apple and it aims to grab one or two top-tier customers from TSMC. In addition to producing Apple’s A-series chips, Intel is also thought to be supplying LTE cellular modems for select AT&T and some international iPhone 7 models. What does all of this mean for Apple’s relationship with TSMC? Apple most likely won’t just drop TSMC for Intel—the firm isn’t foolish to rely on any single supplier for such a crucial component that the engine which powers the iPhone and iPad is. What Tim Cook & Co. are probably looking to do is pit TSMC and Intel against each other to squeeze the best deals out of them, mitigate risk and gradually reduce reliance on TSMC. A senior Taiwanese chip industry executive said: Intel is definitely the most formidable challenger for TSMC. There is no rivalry between Apple and Intel so it’s really likely that Apple could shift some orders there. The move is also in line with Washington’s policy to encourage U.S. companies to make more products at home. Intel’s Zane Ball argued recently its company can offer a better foundry service than rivals, saying “We can do design, and we can do assembly and test. We have remarkable sources and we will bring these capabilities to our customers as well.” Both Intel’s and TSMC’s foundries have been gearing up to deploy ten and seven-nanometer process technologies to fabricate even smaller and power-friendlier mobile chips. It’s important to keep in mind that semiconductor foundries like Samsung, TSMC and Intel will not actually design future iPhone processors themselves—that’s Apple’s self-imposed responsibility. Since the iPhone 4’s A4 chip back in 2010, the Cupertino firm’s been designing these things in-house. They acqu-hired a bunch of fabless semiconductor experts and now have more than a thousand silicon engineers on site, thinking up new A-series chips. Once the team’s designs are finalized, blueprints are sent to companies like TSMC who then fabricate silicon wafers en masse. Summing up, I find it fascinating that Intel originally passed on the opportunity to build the iPhone’s processor because it grossly underestimated potential volumes as it thought the handset would not prove popular. Anecdotal evidence: Apple itself approached Intel with the request to build chips for the original iPhone. It’s funny that—faced with the slowly dying desktop market—Intel is now looking to boost revenues by building the chips it didn’t even design, for a client it already turned down, to power the device it overlooked a decade ago.

Close share panel Image copyright Charitybuzz Image caption Prototype Apple 1s were manually soldered and used for debug testing A prototype Apple 1, a holy-grail item in electronics memorabilia, has been sold for $815,000 (£618,000). Apple co-founders Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak built just 200 of the computers in 1976. The model auctioned this week contains tell-tale signs that it is a prototype, probably made prior to its manufacturing run. One computer historian says it is "one of the first, if not the first ever" Apple computer. This "celebration edition" Apple 1 was expected to make $1m, but auctioneer Charitybuzz told the BBC that the final bid was $815,000. That means it is not the highest-grossing Apple 1 computer - that distinction belongs to a rare working version that sold for $905,000 at a Bonhams auction in New York in October 2014. Image copyright Charitybuzz Image caption The machine ran on the Apple 1 BASIC operating system A spokeswoman for Charitybuzz said that "about 80 bidders" had been watching the item. She denied reports that there had been a last-minute $1.2m bid, apparently made too late to be accepted. Ten percent of the proceeds will go to the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, based in New York, Charitybuzz said. The winning bidders, Glenn and Shannon Dellimore, said they want to take the computer into schools and universities to help inspire young people. Mr Dellimore told the BBC: "It is incredible to think that this was most likely the very first Apple 1, the unicorn or holy grail of computers, the original very first prototype." 'Manually soldered' No more than 70 Apple 1 computers are believed to still be in existence. The machine - initially named "Apple Computer 1" - first went on sale in July 1976, and was discontinued in October of the following year when the company turned its attention to building the Apple 2. The "celebration edition" is different from the other Apple 1s because it was manually soldered on to a blank PC board, meaning it was not part of the only two production runs of the device. Mr Wozniak was quoted by Charitybuzz as saying: "Only a few Apple 1s, on blank (not green) PC boards, may have been manually soldered, although I'm not sure of it. Image copyright Charitybuzz Image caption Some 200 units were produced in 1976, of which about 175 were sold "We arranged the wave soldering with the company that made the PC boards. But we may not have wanted to wave solder a run (of maybe 10 or more board) until we manually soldered one or two to debug them." Apple historian Corey Cohen, who assessed the machine, said in a promotional video that the celebration edition is "one of the first, if not the first, Apple computers because this appears to be one of the sample boards". According to a timestamp on the PC board, it was made in the summer of 1976. Garlanded history Jobs, Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne founded Apple on 1 April 1976 in California in the garage of Paul and Clara Jobs. The trio's first major project was the Apple 1 computer, which was first unveiled at the Homebrew Computer Club - a hobbyist group in Silicon Valley. To help finance the machine's production, Jobs sold his VW Microbus, while Wozniak sold his HP-65 calculator for $500. Image copyright Charitybuzz Image caption Manuals bundled with the Apple 1 show the corporation's original logo, designed by co-founder Ronald Wayne The Apple 1 went on sale in July 1976 at a price of $666.66. About 175 of the 200 units were sold, while the remaining units were destroyed. Two weeks after Apple's formation, Mr Wayne sold his 10% stake for $800. The company's annual revenue last year was $234bn.

According to a new report on the upcoming iPhone 7 from Bloomberg, which primarily focuses on a Japan-specific mobile payment option Apple may add to its new smartphone, the company plans to remove the physical button when it releases the 2017 iPhone. This corroborates an earlier report from The Wall Street Journal, which said Apple design chief Jony Ive has been pushing his team to create an iPhone that “appear like a single sheet of glass” when viewed from the front. Features like Touch ID are expected to be integrated into the display panel as part of a 10th anniversary iPhone that pushes the design envelope further than any past iPhone. According to a Nikkei report from earlier in the week, Apple may introduce a new high-end iPhone in 2017 that will feature an edge-to-edge OLED panel like the Galaxy S7 Edge. An analyst cited by Nikkei even speculates Apple will source OLED panels from Samsung. As for the more immediate future, Apple will reportedly unveil the iPhone 7 on September 7. Reports from both Bloomberg and Nikkei say Apple will reveal two different takes on the iPhone 7: a 5.5-inch Plus model with two back-facing cameras and a regular 4.7-inch model with a single back-facing camera. Both models are expected to feature a pressure sensitive home button while ditching the 3.5mm headphone jack. Related: Apple will reportedly release a curved OLED iPhone in 2017 SourceBloomberg Hello Moto Oh noes! iPhone users are going to start a riot, many of them seem to like a physical home button. Maybe it’ll just be a capacitive home button? JD Make sense. Those new forcetouch trackpad MBPs work pretty damn good. And it’s one less mechanical failure point which has plague the iphone since day 1. Should also make making the device more water resistant easier. Collin dubya every year the iphone becomes more and more of an android phone. Brad Fortin And every year Android phones become more and more like an iPhone. It’s like some sort of market-wide convergence on generic rectangles with rounded corners. Mo Dabbas That’s true. Seems like the two OS’s are getting closer to each others with each iteration. Each is taking what works from the other Iz3man I’m all for that so long as android still allows users to customize it.. I hated apples on the rails hand holding. thereasoner All these leaks about next year’s phone, it’s like Apple is saying “don’t buy another brand this year, we’ll do better next year, promise”….”that is unless you have the 6/6s then definitely buy something because your touchscreen is a ticking time bomb just waiting to fail”. Brad Fortin Except Apple isn’t the source of any of this stuff, it’s a bunch of speculation from “reporters” who want more and more page/ad views. thereasoner How do you know that? If leaks are just reporters then why do so many turn out to be accurate? OEMs leak stuff all the time. Saying that Apple isn’t a source for some of this stuff is just as speculative as saying they are really but the leaks have to come from somewhere. Brad Fortin Like I said, speculation. Some speculation is just made up to get page/ad views, some comes from patents, some are false rumours leaked by Apple, some are true rumours leaked by Apple, and some are just wishful thinking (holographic display with built-in projection keyboard?). It’s a real mélange. But to think that Apple’s leaking rumours about next year’s model is silly as it would Osbourne the model they’re about to announce. thereasoner Unless Apple is trying to say to it’s customers that they should wait until next year if they don’t like the iPhone and its minimal changes this year. Brad Fortin No company would ever tell people not to buy their current/upcoming products because a better one is coming out later. thereasoner I don’t think that they are telling people not to buy their product, more like don’t buy someone else’s just became this iPhone is a minor upgrade. Keep your current iPhone one more year if you don’t like this one because next years will much better. I think it goes without saying that more people would be considering another brand if next years iPhone was also expected to be a minor upgrade. This way, with all the press, customers might choose to wait instead. Besides that, constantly having their name and products in the press is a good thing so long as it’s not always about the poor iPhone build quality. Rev0lver “The iPhone’s iconic home button will reportedly go the way of the dinosaur in 2017” It’s going to evolve into a bird. Awesome! Mo Dabbas I mean is the upcoming iPhone this boring that the rumors are skipping it and jumping right on the 2017 model?? Brad Fortin There’s already been so much coverage of this year’s rumours that “news” outlets have started covering next year’s rumours. By October they’ll be done with next year and they’ll start covering 2018’s rumours. By the time we reach Christmas they’ll be covering rumours about 2028’s neural iMplants. Smanny This is the first year that I have ever seen coverage in regards to any smartphone device. Especially when the phone they are talking about is more than a year away. That is like 5 years away in terms of tech. Please name another OEM or smartphone that had rumors so far into the future? Mo Dabbas You are right. This is the first time this happens when iPhones are released and it’s due to the leaked information about the upcoming iphone not offering much new. Also, it is important that his is a rumor of a device that is 13 months away so who knows what will make it to final production and what will not. Brad Fortin There were rumours of Apple entering the phone market for about 5 years before the iPhone, rumours of a tablet for about 2-3 years before the iPad, rumours about a smart watch for 2-3 years before the Apple Watch, rumours about an HDTV for 3-4 years (still no HDTV), and now there’s rumours about an Apple Car with a rumoured release date of 2020 (with another rumour about delays until 2021-2022). There’s always rumours about Apple products, often years before anything is released. Even when the iPhone 4 was set to be released there were already rumours about an “iPhone 5” with a teardrop design. This is nothing new. John W So this years iteration of the iphone is going to be exactly the same as last years, as there has been a mountain of leaks about 2017’s possible new features. Doesn’t seem like a good way to get people excited about this one. Omar So this means slimmer bezels and on-screen buttons? Smanny Never seen on screen buttons before /s. mwahahahaha How are we supposed to phone home without a home button? Why apple always make life so difficult. Why. Pigs Can Fly So Apple is going button-less (aside power button and vol button) just when more and more Androids are appearing with a home button? Oh well just as long as Apple adds a tap to wake or something rather than wearing out the power button. Mo Dabbas They’ll offer a dongle along with the 2017 iphone with the home button to compensate for the missing home button. and that dongle would connect to the 2017 iPhone via an adapter. So you gotta buy both the dongle and the adapter to press the home button. David Foggia Been running and loving Android for years now, but I’m excited for the iPhone 7. My contract it almost up and I’ll prob consider getting an iPhone for the first time in years Smanny Just wait a while. If it’s anything like this year, then there will be bargains for the iPhone 7. jay The whole screen should take advantage of the force touch that would be good however i like to have a home button and they will keep it anyways Lil’ Cwyin’ Cowar316 MOAR winnin’, y’all. Garrett Cooper “as part of a 10th anniversary iPhone that pushes the design envelope further than any past iPhone” So what you’re telling me is; don’t waste my money on this years version. 10-4!
