At its unveiling of the new iPhone last Thursday, Apple touched on new features introduced in iOS 10, the operating system behind the wildly popular mobile phones. The largest update by far was the update to messaging service iMessage, and although the changes are largely cosmetic, one feature should have businesses at attention worldwide. Apple will introduce capability for third-party apps and services through an iMessage specific app store. A similar feature will come in iOS 10 to Apple’s voice assistant Siri, allowing the user to interact with apps via voice using a newly released application programming interface (API). Siri’s functionality will be initially limited, reports 9to5Mac, with apps Siri ‘knows’ about restricted to ride booking, messaging, Photo search, payments, VoIP calling, and exercise or workouts. What it means for brands This third party capability will let businesses and brands integrate closer with consumers, with Apple’s presentation showing payment service Square and delivery service DoorDash getting on board. Facebook introduced a similar capability into its Messenger service last year, and since that time a number of Australian businesses have started to use the features. iMessage and Siri’s capabilities are not fully revealed, but if they follow in Messenger’s wake, functions to order food and receive news are likely to be featured. One such Australian business that has been using Messenger’s features since May this year is lunch delivery start-up HowAboutEat. Co-founder of the company, Giovannia Ravone, told SmartCompany he is interested in the possibilities iMessage could bring. “We are definitely hoping to explore the new third party features for iMessage, but at the moment it doesn’t look as straightforward as Facebook’s bot,” Ravone says. For HowAboutEat, which sends messages to its users who are signed up to the daily lunch delivery service, Ravone says sending automated regular messages is something better done through Facebook’s service. “It’s all about how they let the bots behave. Facebook allows for proactive and reactive bots, and it’s not clear how Apple will tackle that,” Ravone says. Reactive services only respond when prompted by a customer, such as a customer support bot. Proactive bots send messages unprompted, which Ravone says is difficult to get Facebook’s approval for. Both styles can have big benefits for businesses operations, with Ravone saying using a Facebook Messenger bot has “allowed us to instantly interact with tens of thousands of people”. “The instant gratification for the user is very beneficial. It also allows you to send interactive functionalities like menus or polls,” he says. “Fifty percent of the advantage is the actual functionality opened up by these interactive messages.” The main issue for small businesses Ravone can see is the need for coding knowledge, as implementing these services requires complex custom code. “If you’re just a local restaurant, it’s unlikely you’ll have the skills, as these require some relatively techy know-how,” he says. “If Facebook or Apple made the service more generally accessible, every small business would get on board.” Michelle Gamble from Marketing Angels agrees, saying businesses require both technical knowledge and volume for these services to be worth it. “I think you need to have volume as a business for these things to work, smaller businesses wont have the customer base to make it worth it,” Gamble says. However, Gamble believes businesses that are already integrating with Facebook could easily get on board, saying, “it’s not too much of a stretch”. “If you look at Facebook, businesses are using it as a listening service and it’s very effective for customer feedback. It’s not too much of a stretch to make it more one-on-one,” she says. “If Apple is looking at introducing its own service, it must see a market.” This article was first published on SmartCompany.

And with the inclusion of the Google Play Movies and TV app for iOS gadgets, Apple loyalists get to enjoy an even wider selection and more options when it comes to choosing films and television shows for their entertainment. Here are some of the benefits of using this app on your iOS device. Google Play is available for the iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch, so almost anyone with iOS mobile devices can enjoy using the app. Even if the Google Play app doesn’t allow in-app purchases, you can buy content by opening your browser and going to the website of Google Play. Any movie or TV show you purchase on the site will then appear in your Google Play app. The rates for movie rentals are usually cheaper in Google Play than in iTunes. So you get to save more or you get to enjoy more movies and TV shows without emptying your wallet. There are free TV show episodes offered. You need to create a Google Wallet, but no charges will be applied. The free episodes are found at the bottom of the Movies and TV shows page in the app. Google Play is supported by Chromecast and AirPlay, so you can stream your favorite films and TV shows on a computer monitor or a bigger television screen. You can download your film or television show of choice to save it for later to watch offline. To start downloading, you just have to tap the ‘download’ icon on a movie or TV show. With millions of people using iOS devices across the globe, Google made a wise move in tapping into the market of Apple loyalists. If you want to enjoy the many perks of Google Play on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch, install the app now.

The dual lenses offer one neat trick: They sense depth, so you can blur out the background, bottom, to highlight something in the foreground. (Photo: AP) CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Apple isn’t saying much about its next iPhones, but there’s been plenty of speculation that the giant Plus model will have two camera lenses side by side on the back. Why? A second lens could make photos sharper or give amateur shutterbugs blurring techniques more common in full-bodied SLR cameras. Apple isn’t revealing anything until its product event in San Francisco next week. For now, though, people can look at how a few other smartphone makers are using two lenses. Motorola Moto Z The three Moto Z phones get amazing zoom with a second lens that comes in the form of an optional attachment. Motorola unveiled its third Moto Z model and the attachment, called Hasselblad True Zoom Mod, at the IFA tech show in Berlin on Wednesday. An accessory normally wouldn’t count, but in this case, it’s an integral part of the phone once you attach it with powerful magnets. The Moto Z has a mix-and-match design that makes it possible to remove its back and replace it with a speaker, a projector or a zoom lens that offers 10-fold magnification — better than what many point-and-shoot cameras offer. You’d be wrong to think smartphones already offer zoom capabilities by pinching out on the screen. That’s just a software trick that leaves images fuzzy. The camera lens itself is fixed; you need an attachment for true zoom. With it, a statue of Alexander Hamilton in New York’s Central Park looks as sharp from afar as it would closer up. By contrast, the same statue taken with the regular lens from afar looks dull. It’s possible to make out a New York University logo on a bean-bag toss game board shot with the second lens from across the lawn; with the regular lens, it’s just a blob of purple. This functionality will cost you, though. The module alone will start at $250 when it comes out in mid-September, or at the high end of what point-and-shoots cost. That’s on top of $400 for the cheapest Moto Z. Motorola says the attachment will appeal mostly to photography aficionados, but the company believes that’s a sizable market. The results are indeed remarkable, but not flawless. It takes a second or so to focus and shoot, enough to miss a moving subject. Faces can look distorted near the edges of the image, and the second lens doesn’t do extreme close-ups, known as macros. That’s one thing stand-alone cameras still do better. And the attachment is about as heavy and bulky as a point and shoot. But the module gives you amazing zoom shots that you can easily share via the phone. That’s not a simple task with most cameras. Motorola’s Moto Z phone, with the Hasselblad True Zoom attachment, has zooming capability without sacrificing the ability to easily share images through the phone.  (Photo: AP) LG G5 The G5’s second lens offers an impressive 135-degree wide angle, compared with 78 degrees on the normal one. That’s the difference between getting the entire Colosseum in Rome into a single shot, as opposed to just some of it. At St. Peter’s Basilica in the Vatican City, the wide angle gets you not just Michelangelo’s dome but also the ornate columns holding it up. With most cameras, you’re shooting as though you lack peripheral vision. With a wide angle, the photo frame expands to almost match your real-life field of view. Wide angles aren’t always desirable. If you’re shooting an elephant in front of you, you want more of the elephant and less of its surroundings. But wide angles are great when you’re shooting a large landmark or a large group of people from close up. As with other wide-angle lenses, though, LG’s produces distortion around the edges of the image. Think of how warped fisheye shots look. Columns inside St. Peter’s Basilica look curved rather than straight. Distant objects look even farther away. The regular lens is what you’ll want most of the time. Of course, you can get something close to a wide-angle shot by installing apps or using built-in panorama features, but it takes time to pan across the landscape, rather than snap once. That software approach also doesn’t work for video. Huawei P9 One lens captures images in color, the other in black and white, or monochrome. The dedicated lens produces sharper monochrome shots than you can get by letting software bleach out the color from an ordinary image. Huawei says it also lets in more light. In practice, though, the differences are subtle. Images of colorful street art in New York often look cleaner, with better contrast, using the monochrome lens than by running comparable color shots through a black-and-white software filter. While this will matter to artists, it probably won’t to most users, especially since people rarely take black-and-white shots anyway. But that monochrome lens promises to help color shots as well. By using sensors for the two lenses in conjunction, the phone can restore some of the detail and light lost to filters in the color sensor. The result is a camera that’s among the top in the class — though recent iPhones and Samsung Galaxy phones do just as well or better with just the color lens. And despite promises of better lighting, the Galaxy S7 often produced better night shots than the P9. The dual lenses offer one neat trick: They sense depth, so you can blur out the background to highlight something in the foreground, mimicking an SLR technique done by adjusting the lens aperture. The P9 isn’t available in the U.S. yet, but Huawei is taking a similar dual-lens approach with the just-announced Honor 8. CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Some customers are dealing with shipping times extending as far out into the future as October or November, but regardless of how long you’ll be waiting, everyone who bought an iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus has one thing in common: we should all be preparing for the day when it arrives. Being prepared for the new iPhone will help you to have a seamless transition from your current handset to the new one, and there are some preliminary steps you can and should follow. 1. Back up your current iPhone Although some people don’t mind starting out completely fresh when they get a new iPhone in the mail, others like to migrate their existing files and data from their current iPhone to their new one. This is done by backing up your iPhone’s data. You can do this one of two ways: through iCloud, or through iTunes. I will say from experience that iTunes seems to be a far more reliable way of backing up your information, and if you don’t have reliable access to the internet, then iTunes is a great way to back up your information locally instead of online. 2. Have a plan for headphones As you probably know by now, the new iPhone doesn’t have a 3.5mm headphone jack. Instead, Apple wants you to use Lightning-based headphones or wireless Bluetooth headphones like the newly-unveiled Apple AirPods. Apple includes a Lightning-to-3.5mm adapter in the box with the iPhone 7, but we think it might get a little old to use when you realize the adapter is going to get in the way of charging your device as the battery level gets low. Related: 4 ways to listen to music on your iPhone 7 while it charges As a result, you may want to prepare for your upcoming iPhone by thinking ahead of time about what you want to use to listen to your music. If you need help figuring out what headphones to get, we have a comprehensive roundup of 7 great Bluetooth headphones to try with your new iPhone 7. 3. Consider a case The new iPhone isn’t cheap, as always, but the cost paired with the unfortunate caveat that the new Jet Black finish is prone to micro-abrasions from everyday use, spell out a very good reason to put your new iPhone in some sort of case for protection. We know it seems counter-productive for such a beautiful device to be covered up in a piece of flimsy plastic and rubber, but when it comes to protecting your investment, it’s money well spent. In fact, you might want to consider buying a case ahead of time so that you have protection for your new iPhone before it even reaches your doorstep. Because there are so many cases out there to choose from, we made a roundup of 6 great cases you can buy for the iPhone 7 right now to get you started. 4. Figure out what you’ll do with your old iPhone After upgrading to a new iPhone, it’s always a tough choice to decide what you’re going to do with your retired Apple device. Some people like to hold onto them and save them for a rainy day, such as when your new iPhone breaks (knock on wood), while others like to cash in on what they’re worth to go towards the cost of upgrading to their new iPhone. If you will be selling your iPhone, remember to restore the device to factory settings ahead of time to keep your personal data from being read. Obviously, don’t sell your device until after you have your new one in hand. As for me, I’ll probably be keeping my old iPhone around for an iOS 10 jailbreak if one ever rolls around Are you prepared for your new iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus?

If i buy and iPhone 7 plus full price at apple… can i use it with any other service provider around the world? meaning .. would it be unlocked for any carrier? thanks Wilber Alexander Flores Yes 🙂 Juan Felipe Yañez Thanks. My zone uses GSM so what type of carrier should I choose. Cause i understand some use CDMA and others GSM Wilber Alexander Flores Not sure about that I’m in Canada TornBodies only the verizon and sprint variants this year are fully unlocked in the sense they have both cdma and gsm ur best bet is buying a verizon or sprint model if u wanna use it as a world phone 5723alex . Not if you buy the iPhone 7 in US as the devices are unlocked but not SIM free, yet. For an unlocked and SIM free you’ll have to wait 1-2 months. If you buy the iPhone 7 anywhere else in the world you will get an unlocked, SIM free device. Juan Felipe Yañez Sorry but I don´t get this. If its unlocked whats the point on having a sim free? I mean if its unlocked could´t I just insert my regular Sim ?? Felipe Queiroz Drumond #3 is extremely important to keep your device in good condition to make a good deal when selling it (#4). When I’m about to buy a new Phone I purchase a great case and screen shield, and install them as soon as I open the iPhone’s box. Therefore, my device is in a pristine-like condition when I sell it. nova voter got the shipping notification. my jet black 7 will be here tomorrow. so pumped. question: if I want to sell my 9.3.3 iPhone 6+, will cydia impactor (or whatever it’s called now) get rid of ALL my personal settings and allow the buyer to set it up without needing my iCloud login? Jose Rivera You MUST remove your iCloud account prior to erasing your device. You can’t just erase it and expect every single thing to be removed because iCloud links your devices serial numbers and UDID to the servers. Cydia impactos will only remove the jailbrak but I’m not sure about wiping the device… Use iTunes for that… Or else you’ll have to figure out how to remove your Apple ID if you don’t remember it nova voter thanks. I would def log out of my iCloud account, turn off find my iPhone etc. could be a helpful tutorial from iDB — how to get your jailbroken phone set for resale.

NUI Galway’s Máistir Gairmiúil san Oideachas (MGO ) programme has been awarded the Apple Distinguished Programme 2016-18’. The award identifies centres of excellence in the use of technology in education. In February 2015, the MGO was the first third-level programme outside the USA to be awarded the Apple Distinguished Programme award. Professor Gerry MacRuairc, the newly appointed Professor of Education and Head of School at NUI Galway said: “The potential of this type of technology to enrich learning for all is extraordinary. The depth of learning and the variety of the learning experiences enabled by the iPad material designed by Seán Ó Grádaigh, the MGO team and most importantly the MGO students themselves in the School of Education is an exemplar for how we need to use technology to enrich the learning of our how teacher educators and the student they teach.” The MGO is a two year, full-time programme offered through the medium of Irish, by the School of Education at NUI Galway. The MGO is unique in that it is the only initial teacher education programme that prepares future teachers to teach in second-level Irish medium schools. The programme equips student teachers with the professional knowledge, theoretical and conceptual tools necessary for developing creative, flexible and reflective approaches to teaching. A particular emphasis is placed on teaching through the medium of Irish and on the development of strategies for teaching and learning both content and language (CLIL ). Director of the MGO programme, Dr Brendan Mac Mahon said: “We are delighted to receive this award again this year. It is testament to the excellent work of the programme team and student teachers in the ongoing development of educational technology.” View/Hide Tags Galway FBD Insurance League professor United States Education teacher Technology_Internet NUI Galway director iPad School of Education educational technology Gerard Quinn Shannon College of Hotel Management Brendan Mac Mahon Professor of Education and Head of School Gerry MacRuairc MGO Advertisement More Stories...

iPhone 7 Plus — The Case for 56mm Updated 15th September, 2016. Posted 13th September, 2016. 35mm is an established standard for general photography. It was natural for Apple to target roughly that focal length in 2007, but since then the iPhone camera has mostly featured even wider lenses. Phone thickness limited focal length, and perhaps wide lenses are favored by customers as well. Then came iPhone 7 Plus. The dual camera system has significant implications for the iPhone as a photographic tool. I was not sampled an iPhone 7 Plus for this article. Comparison photos were taken using a camera set to 28mm and 56mm equivalent focal lengths. Figure 1 iPhone 7 Plus dual lens promotional image. View on Apple's website here. Focal Length Cameras are defined by physical constraints. The lens must gather light from the world and project it on to a sensor. Every lens has a field of view which indicates whether it can see a wide sweeping vista all at once. Or works more like binoculars, picking out a small area. This lens principal is expressed in millimeters (mm). Higher numbers being a narrower view and lower numbers a wider view. Apple's last camera on the iPhone 6S was a 29mm ƒ/2.2 unit. For the iPhone 7 Plus, they have gone both wider and narrower. The wide lens is 28mm ƒ/1.8 while the telephoto lens is 56mm ƒ/2.8. iOS 10 implements the telephoto lens as an "optical zoom" and uses a 2x button to change cameras. This might give the impression that the baseline photo mode is 1x, but that isn't correct. They are both baseline photo modes, useful for different things, and each is very capable. Figure 2 is similar to what an iPhone 6S would take at that distance. Figure 3 was taken the exact same distance away, but at 56mm. The telephoto framing is clearly better for a classic head and shoulders portrait. Perspective distortion on the head is acceptably low, and I was able to stand at a reasonable distance. Figure 2 Head of Jean d’Are, Burgher of Calais. Photo captured at 28mm. Figure 3 Same camera location as Figure 2. Photo captured at 56mm. If you try to reproduce the same subject framing with the wide-angle lens there is quite a bit of perspective distortion ( figure 4 ). The portrait is a lot less flattering, and you have to get the camera very close. A lot more environment is also captured, there is less subject isolation. The telephoto camera captures roughly the center one quarter of the wide angle camera ( figure 5 ). Neither camera is a better or worse focal length, they are complimentary tools for taking different kinds of photos. Figure 4 The same head framing as Figure 3, captured at 28mm. Figure 5 What the telephoto lens would capture inside a wide-angle frame. 56mm: A Camera Odyssey Previously the iPhone had a significant limitation as a camera. It was wide angle only. Some marvelous photos are taken with a wide lens; many are not. According to ExploreCams the most common focal length used to take photos with DSLRs is 50mm. The most commonly used prime lens in DSLR systems is a fast 50mm. This is not an accident. 50mm is a well-placed compromise between wide and narrow focal lengths. It's a very "human size" lens in terms of field of view, and it lets you isolate subjects effectively. Just as with 35mm in the first iPhone, it's no surprise that Apple picked something around 50mm for their longer lens. Figure 6 Photo taken at 56mm. It would not have been possible to take this photo with a 28mm lens because it was unsafe to fall into the gorge. Photography is an amalgamation of art and mechanics. While this new lens might only have twice the focal length, that artistic flexibility grants disproportionately superior results. Portraiture, as an example. People behave very differently when an object is shoved up into their face. Being able to take that portrait at 30 inches (76 cm) rather than 16 inches (40 cm) is huge for the natural expression of the model. Even more huge for candids, or shooting from a less invasive location at an event. This one seemingly minor change has a large effect on the flexibility offered by the camera. Figure 7 Photo taken at 50mm. It would not have been possible to take this photo with a 28mm lens because perspective distortion would have ruined the lines of the car. Reproduced in Display P3 gamut. Technical Limitations While the telephoto lens unlocks tremendous potential, there are also areas it will perform less well than its wide angle colleague. Mainly, low light performance will be notably worse. To package this lens, it is possible that Apple had to include a smaller sensor or a telephoto group. Additionally they had to reduce the aperture to ƒ/2.8, so it lets in less than half the light compared to the ƒ/1.8 wide angle lens. iPhones are not the most ergonomic or stable camera platform, and the increased focal length will exaggerate that. Keeping shake-induced blur to a minimum requires the shutter be faster at all times. A trick used by the wide angle lens in low light is to stabilize the optics, and leave the shutter open as long as possible to gather the most light. That trick will be less effective with the telephoto lens, especially if it lacks stabilization. Figure 8 Photo taken at 50mm. It would not have been possible to take this photo with a 28mm lens because getting too close would have occluded the important natural light. Reproduced in Display P3 gamut. The Camera You Have If you get an iPhone 7 Plus, don't just use the 2x mode when you want a little more zoom. Try it out for awhile. Think at fifty-six millimeters. Frame shots with it, isolate subjects with it, shoot parts of things rather than the whole thing, find interesting perspectives, fill the foreground, and so much more. I am excited because this puts a much more versatile photography tool into the hands of millions of people. It might not be an ultra-fast, stabilized camera. It might not even be the same sensor. But it's good enough to change the way you think about phone photography. Which is really the point, and almost certainly part of the reason Apple did it. You have to care about photography to build this feature. Figure 9 Photo taken at 56mm. Maybe you could have taken this with a 28mm lens. But it's so cute that I don't care. Lenses Despite "telephoto" sounding a bit funny for a lens that is only 56mm. It is technically possible and perhaps not just marketing. If the sensor is 1/3-inch it likely contains a telephoto group, and the focal length of the lens is very likely longer than the lens' physical length. Therefore it is, probably, actually a telephoto lens. The math doesn't quite work out for it to be a 1/3-inch sensor without altering the optical center. So either there is a telephoto group, or the sensor is smaller than 1/3-inch. iFixit has once again done a great service by tearing down brand new hardware. Based on their iPhone 7 Plus teardown two things seem fairly clear. The sensor packages for both cameras appear to be the same size ( figure 11 ) The 56mm lens is not stabilized. It does include a focusing voice coil (VCM) as usual, but no electromagnetic suspension system. Figure 11 X-Ray view of the iPhone 7 Plus camera system with annotations. Note that the aperture of the housing is not indicative of the objective lens size or the effective lens aperture. Image sourced from iFixit. I'm not clear on where the sensor effective area begins and ends in figure 11, but the outline of the package is consistent for both sensors. Therefore 7.3mm is almost certainly not the actual effective diagonal, and it's probably a 6mm sensor. EXIF reports the focal length of the telephoto lens to be 6.6mm, but the math says that the focal length on a 1/3-inch sensor should actually be 7.8mm (thicker than the phone). People initially assumed that this meant the sensor was smaller, which could be true. There is another possibility, you can design a multi-element lens. In its most basic form this uses a convex lens to converge incoming light rays. Before they converge, another lens group acts as a concave lens which causes the light rays to diverge to a straighter path again. This lets you build a lens that has a longer focal length than its physical size would generally support ( figure 12 ). When Apple repeatedly called the 56mm lens a "telephoto" lens, I was curious about that word choice. Everything I have said is speculation, we wait for actual measurements. Figure 12 In this telephoto diagram, H' is the principal plane, and it lies outside the lens entirely. This makes for a much longer focal length. Image sourced from Wikipedia. Depth of Field I spent this whole time talking about the functional difference between two cameras. What else can you do with two cameras? You can depth map the environment. Which is what Apple is doing for their not-quite-ready Portrait mode. It will also be immensely important for Augmented Reality applications. There are some caveats to this process, such as edges of objects and reflective or transparent objects being difficult to describe. Hair is a good example of something that is difficult in stereo depth mapping. Apple is no doubt using secret sauce to approximate edges and refine the effect. What kinds of objects it can trace, and how effectively it does it, will be a fascinating study. Figure 10 iPhone 7 Plus depth mapping feature demonstrated during Apple's keynote on September 7th, 2016. There is a lot of concern about how authentic the "fake" DoF blur will look, and it could go either way. A simple implementation could be a Gaussian Blur effect applied crudely, which would indeed look mediocre. The other possibility is that it will look great. It is entirely possible that the depth map has enough granularity to understand faces accurately. That Apple is simulating an aperture with blades, and creating a circle of confusion approximation at various depths. How to simulate an optical system to produce great looking bokeh is entirely a known quantity. We see it with digital lenses all the time in cinema CG scenes. The only questions are: How good is the depth map output? How ambitious was Apple with their optical simulation? Grab Bag One team at Apple which has been hitting it out of the park for years, but getting little recognition, finally got some. The ISP team. They've been responsible for a lot of the magic that makes iPhone photos good for quite awhile now. Thumbs up, guys and gals. iPhones now shoot in wide color. See my article on the subject. It's a bit unclear which iPhones inherit this feature with iOS 10. With the new RAW APIs it is probably possible to extract wide color from other iPhone cameras. RAW files don't inherently contain a color space, white balance, or many of the other attributes we tend to think of in digital imagery. It's a bunch of bits assembled by the ISP which has to be processed at display time. This means that RAW can and often does contain color and bit depth information outside of what your display can realize. It would surprise me if Apple isn't using some kind of cross-camera mixing to increase the capability of both cameras. Such as when taking a portrait, use the wide angle lens to gather more luma samples from the face and improve photo quality within the ISP. Perhaps even just use it for noise control.

Best Buy this evening sent out emails informing customers of the delay, explaining that the new street date for the Apple Watch Series 2 is September 28th. The email doesn’t specify a reasoning for the delay, though Best Buy places the blame on Apple. “We’ve learned from Apple there’s been a shipping delay for this item,” the email reads. As for the new September 28th release date, Best Buy says that customers should expect their Apple Watch Series 2 to arrive “on or around” the September 28th date, with arrivals times potentially varying because of location. To make up for the delay, Best Buy is offering customers a $50 promotional code towards their next purchase at Best Buy. It’s unclear at this point if everyone who preordered the Apple Watch Series 2 from Best Buy is affected by this delay, but it seems as if it’s at least a good portion. As for those who preordered from Apple, the company has not made any announcements concerning delays of those shipments, though most users are still waiting for their order to ship despite the September 16th date quickly approaching. Personally, my Apple Watch Series 2 order is still listed as “Preparing for shipment” on Apple’s order status page. In terms of retail availability, we’ve heard from our retail sources that stores have received Apple Watch Series 2 supply, although it’s apparently very limited in variety and quantity. Have you received notification of your Apple Watch Series 2 being delayed? Let us know in the comments and read the full email from Best Buy below. Thanks Bill! Dear ___, Thank you for your recent pre-order for the Apple Watch Series 2. Unfortunately, we\’ve learned from Apple there’s been a shipping delay for this item. Here’s what you need to know: The new street date for this product is 9/28/2016. You can expect to receive your new Apple Watch Series 2 on or around this date, depending on your location. You can view your order status on BestBuy.com/OrderStatus.

In leaked emails obtained by Mic, both former and current female Apple employees allege a sexist work environment within the company. The emails contain everything from complaints to Apple CEO Tim Cook to resignation letters. One of the first instances detailed by Mic involves Danielle (name changed), who emailed Cook after she overheard a rape joke made by men on her team. "Rape jokes in work chat is basically where I completely draw the limit," she wrote in the email. "I do not feel safe at a company that tolerates individuals who make rape jokes.” She didn't receive a response. Other allegations include male coworkers asking women to smile or passing over them when it came to hiring for positions. Some women felt they couldn’t report the behavior for fear of retaliation, instead choosing to take demotions or even quit. “Despite all attempts to seek justice within this corporation, the cries of several minority employees about the toxic and oppressive environment have gone unanswered,” one resignation read. “I have witnessed the complete and utter disenfranchising of the voices of men and women of color and the fault lies not only in the direct management staff but in the response of those tasked with protecting employee rights.” Meanwhile, other employees, like Amanda (name also changed), took action. She filed a complaint with the Department of Fair Employment and Housing to investigate the company’s treatment of female employees. Refinery29 has reached out to Apple for comment.

Stern left TWC earlier this year after it was bought out by rival Charter Communications. The new VP will report to Eddy Cue, who oversees businesses like the iTunes Store and Apple Music. Mr. Stern has deep knowledge of the cable industry’s economics, and relationships with a number of major media companies. A well-respected cable industry veteran, Mr. Stern was a key Time Warner Cable executive involved in talks with Apple a few years ago about a potential deal to offer a joint television service over an Apple set-top box, people familiar with the matter said.  At cable industry conferences, Mr. Stern was often vocal about how cable companies should move away from leasing customers proprietary set-top boxes and should be more open to offering their TV services as apps on many different devices.  It’s unclear if Apple brought on Stern to aid with its streaming TV efforts, or a separate project. Apple at one time was rumored to be working on a TV service, but stalled negotiations forced it to refocus on producing original content.

The new Twitter video app will be available for users with these devices without a Twitter account or a pay-TV subscription, Twitter issued in a statement on Wednesday. The application will feature video content from a number of companies that partnered with Twitter including the National Football League and the National Basketball Association, according to Fortune. Users will now be able to stream NFL games as well as other sporting events. Question: Does @twitter release an AppleTV app tomorrow so that users can watch live NFL games starting on Thursday night? Discuss. — Chris Ptacek (@chrisptacek) September 13, 2016 Twitter’s announcement comes just a day before the first of 10 NFL Thursday night games. Thursday night’s game featuring the New York Jets and Buffalo Bills will stream on CBS, NFL Network, and Twitter. Twitter reportedly spent a cool $10 million on the rights and won over Verizon and Amazon according to Mashable. Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter, has been pushing for Twitter into video, signing deals with several media companies and sports organizations. Some of which include MLB Advanced Media, NBA, Pac 12 Networks, Campus Insiders, Bloomberg News, and a new business startup called Cheddar. [Image by Scott Olson/Getty Images] Along with videos, the app will stream tweets, Vines, and Periscopes. The app Periscope was launched by Twitter for Apple TV last year. Inside of the new Twitter video streaming app, users will be able to choose to see tweets and videos side by side. The tweets are pulled from any user based on relevant content. While live streaming content, users will be able to select a video that appears on the stream of tweets. The timing of the application launch is a disappointment to some Twitter shareholders, such as the president of Jupiter Wealth Strategies. “It’s great to see Twitter get in bed with giants like Amazon, Microsoft and Apple, however, they need to be more proactive in marketing themselves and new initiatives.” Twitter declined to share if they are running TV ads around the NFL games.

Quoted tweets will also no longer reduce the count of characters. [Image by Bethany Clarke/Getty Images] Twitter is set to make these changes on September 19. Twitter first made the announcement of plans to stop counting extra media toward the 140-character limit back in May but did not give a date as to when users could expect the change. Another new adjustment to Twitter’s character count will be that usernames will no longer count when they are at the beginning of reply tweets. Twitter’s CEO spoke with Verge back in May when the announcement was first made. “This is the most notable change we’ve made in recent times around conversation in particular, and around giving people the full expressiveness of the 140 characters “I’m excited to see even more dialog because of this.” Dorsey has always been a fan of the 140-character tweet limit, which was originally implemented so that the tweets could fit within SMS messages. Users can expect the character limit to be updated next week and just center around the message — not the media attached to the tweet. <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3oL6H3wk_QY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> [Featured Image by Bethany Clarke/Getty Images] Now Watch This: Biden and Obama Memes Take Over The Internet Now Read This: Marilyn Monroe ‘Happy Birthday, Mr. President’ Dress Sells For $4.81 Million Share 4 Tweet 0 Share 0 Share 0 Pin It 0 Author Amanda Katherine Tags: Twitter, twitter status Comments LATEST HEADLINES Marilyn Monroe ‘Happy Birthday, Mr. President’ Dress Sells For $4.81 Million Kylie Jenner ‘Pregnant’ With Tyga’s Baby: Snapchat Hiatus Due To Morning Sickness?

Time The Apple Store, Upper West Side is shown July 27, 2016 in New York City. A report in the media outlet Mic cited a dozen former and current employees complaining of sexism at the consumer device giant. (Photo: Kena Betancur/Getty Images) SAN FRANCISCO — Apple, whose CEO Tim Cook has pledged to make the company more diverse and inclusive, has come under fire for its treatment of women. A dozen former and current Apple employees told Mic they were subjected to sexist comments from co-workers and were passed over for leadership positions. The emails, shared by an Apple employee with the media outlet, were sparked by the experience of an Apple engineer who complained her male co-workers joked about rape. In all, Mic says it obtained more than 50 pages of leaked emails with women detailing alleged boorish behavior by male colleagues. One man also weighed in, saying he was told he was too emotional and was repeatedly asked if he was on his "Man Period." It did not quote any by name. One woman, who says she was never given the opportunity to apply for two jobs that were never posted and given to two men by her male boss, told Mic she filed a complaint last month with the state Department of Fair Employment and Housing and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in hopes of getting the agencies to investigate. In a statement, Apple told USA TODAY it could not discuss the complaints "out of respect for the privacy of our employees." “Apple is committed to treating everyone with dignity and respect," read the statement. "When we receive complaints or hear that employees are concerned about their work environment, we take it very seriously and we investigate claims thoroughly. If we find behavior to be at odds with our values, we take action." The allegations come at a sensitive moment for Apple as it works to hire more women and underrepresented minorities, a priority for Cook who has staked his leadership on bringing more diversity to the employee ranks of the world's most valuable company. Like other major technology companies, Apple has a big gender gap in its work force. Nearly seven out of 10 employees are men. Apple has touted its progress in hiring more women, saying last month that 37% of new hires in the last year were women. 2317 CONNECTTWEET 16 LINKEDIN 12 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2d0OwLL

But maybe don't run and download it just yet. According to The Verge, the update has been problematic for many users, conveniently stopping permanently midway through the process. Though for me, it was a breeze. I downloaded the update through WiFi, and my phone was ready to use within ten minutes. After playing around with some of the newer features, here's what you need to know about iOS 10. Making last-minute purchases is almost too easy. Apple Pay is now compatible with websites. Previously, I only used the feature for groceries when I didn't want to take my credit card out of my purse. But now Apple lists Sephora, Target, and Lululemon as websites that use Apple Pay. Shop for a new bronzer or yoga pants with your fingerprint. (RIP responsible budget.) You can delete built-in Apple apps. I've ghosted two financial advisers this year, so the Stocks app is basically a lost cause for me. Luckily, the new update allows users to remove built-in apps like Tips, Find My Friends, and Compass that you couldn't before from the home screen. __Sending messages is a new experience. __ Some people have had issues sending texts, such as opening the Messages app or receiving texts at all. I haven't encountered any problems, and I'm still receiving my mom's hourly texts like clockwork. https://twitter.com/AkilahObviously/status/775841263018991616 Plus, when I text my mom back, I can send more than the heart emoji. Yup, you can add Digital Touch messages to all texts. These include drawings and pulsing effects like a heartbeat or kiss. If you're feeling particularly lazy, double-tap a message and react to it, just like you can on Facebook. On someone's birthday, attach confetti or balloons that will burst onto their screen when they see your HBD text. facebook dialog Pinterest Emojis got a face-lift. All the people-themed emojis look 3-D with the update. Their features are more defined and colorful. The dancing twins look especially different, and I'm not truly ready to accept that change. The best part: There's more gender diversity in the sports selection—just as Unicode announced back in May. Now women can shoot hoops, hit the links, and get muscles. Swiping has a new system. If you're reckless and forgo having a passcode, you'll have to adjust to the new way of accessing your home screen. Instead of swiping, all you have to do is hold your finger down. I play it safe and take full advantage of Touch ID, so I didn't immediately realize the change. Swiping left now takes you to the notification screen with news and calendar updates. Also, instead of swiping up to get to the camera, you go right.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Apple may have packed bigger batteries into the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, but one Chinese company says it can do better. LeEco released a teaser for its upcoming Le 3 Pro on Wednesday, promising better battery life and taking a direct shot at Apple. The image appears to show a big battery literally squashing an apple. The image mocks the iPhone 7 for packing a “mini” battery that only offers one extra hour of use per charge. Near the bottom of the teaser, the company hypes its own device, which is set to launch in seven days on September 21. LeEco doesn’t actually reveal what kind of hardware its new phone will offer, but we may already know thanks to recent leaks. The Le Pro 3 is expected to come in two main variants, with the cheaper allegedly packing a 4070mAh battery, a 5.5-inch 1080p display, a 16-megapixel rear camera, an 8-megapixel front-facing camera, a Snapdragon 821 chip, 6GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. The higher-end model could boast a 5000mAh battery, a 5.7-inch 2K display, 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. That should add up to a pretty powerful smartphone. It certainly puts the iPhone to shame spec-for-spec, but Apple may still have the edge thanks to its tight hardware-software integration. If battery life is extremely important to you the Le Pro 3 may be the way to go, though we still don’t know if this device will ever make its way to the U.S. Source PlayfulDroid Topics #LeEco Products Mentioned Apple iPhone 7 Plus Jacob Kleinman Jacob Kleinman has been working as a journalist online and in print since he arrived at Wesleyan University in 2007.

The former Time Warner Cable executive is joining Apple. Photo: Getty Images By Shalini Ramachandran Shalini Ramachandran The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyShalini Ramachandran @shalini Google+ Shalini.Ramachandran@wsj.com Sept. 14, 2016 5:11 p.m. ET 7 COMMENTS Apple Inc. has hired former Time Warner Cable executive Peter Stern as a vice president working on cloud services, which includes the technology company’s subscription offerings such as Apple Music and a potential streaming television service. An Apple spokesman confirmed the hire. Mr. Stern will report to Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of internet software and services, a person familiar with the matter said. Mr. Cue oversees Apple’s growing services segment, which includes businesses like the iTunes Store, Apple Pay and Apple Music. He has also led Apple’s yearslong, on-and-off negotiations with media companies for a proposed television streaming service, though those efforts haven’t yet borne fruit. Mr. Stern, who is 44 years old, left Time Warner Cable earlier this year after it was bought by rival cable company Charter Communications Inc. He served in senior strategy and corporate development roles at the cable company as it maneuvered through multiple takeover attempts over the past few years. Most recently, as chief product, people and strategy officer, Mr. Stern helped implement a strategy focused on customer service that helped Time Warner Cable grow its cable TV subscribers last year after nearly a decade of losses. A well-respected cable industry veteran, Mr. Stern was a key Time Warner Cable executive involved in talks with Apple a few years ago about a potential deal to offer a joint television service over an Apple set-top box, people familiar with the matter said. At cable industry conferences, Mr. Stern was often vocal about how cable companies should move away from leasing customers proprietary set-top boxes and should be more open to offering their TV services as apps on many different devices. Despite that, Apple’s talks with Time Warner Cable stalled over a number of other issues, including content rights, and the two sides never reached a deal. Hiring Mr. Stern could aid Apple’s efforts in television. Mr. Stern has deep knowledge of the cable industry’s economics and has relationships with major media companies. It’s unclear, however, whether his appointment means Apple will refocus efforts on launching a streaming television service. Mr. Stern’s role will cover cloud services generally, including other areas like iTunes, iCloud and Apple Music. Before joining Time Warner Cable in 2004, Mr. Stern worked in strategy at the cable operator’s former parent Time Warner Inc. Prior to that, he was a consultant with McKinsey & Co. Mr. Stern, who plays piano, holds a J.D. from Yale Law School and majored in English and music at Harvard University.

LG, Lenovo, and Huawei aren't going to release new Android Wear smartwatches in 2016, according to CNET, which seems to imply they are in no hurry to put out new hardware, as consumer demand might not be so demanding. When Apple introduced the Apple Watch last week, it became clear the company was no longer positioning the wearable as a fashion accessory but rather a fitness device, likely because consumers are more interested in buying fitness bands (cheap ones, specifically). Three out of four wearable devices worn in the US are fitness bands, over half of which are affordable products made by Fitbit. Apple Watch Series 2 review: Fitness first That statistic comes from Kantar Worldpanel ComTech’s May 2016 wearable report, while a more recent report from research firm CCS Insight also found that consumers would rather spend their money on inexpensive fitness bands. It's therefore no surprise to hear three of the biggest Android Wear manufacturers have no plans to release pricey smartwatches this year. Keep in mind these companies usually announce new products at the annual IFA show in Berlin, but none of them did in 2016. We didn't see a third-generation Moto 360, nor did we see a new Huawei Watch. CNET suggested Android Wear partners are reluctant to release new hardware because of a lack of consumer interest and the inability to attract the average consumer. For instance, Samsung told CNET most smartwatch consumers are male early adopters. Also, the inability to add LTE radios could be hindering manufacturers. While they could technically include LTE radios, they'd be giving up battery life gains, and their Android Wear products would be even more heftier than they already are, which is like going backwards in tech innovation. Google is expected to unleash Android Wear 2.0 this autumn, so it'll be interesting to see how it launches that update, especially with no new smartwatches coming out to run it. Although Google is rumoured to be developing a Nexus smartwatch, it still doesn't look good that the only new product showcasing the software would be a Google-made product. It looks like Android Wear partners need some encouragement to innovate.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « National Geographic Takes us on an African Photo Shoot using the new iPhone 7 | Main | Samsung Note 7 Fire Reports Continue as Samsung Rushes to send out a Temporary Software Fix » September 14, 2016 Apple Hires Time Warner Cable Executive for iCloud and Future TV Services   In July Patently Apple posted a report titled "Apple Once thought they cracked the TV Market, but just Keep Spinning their Wheels in Vain." At that time Eddy Cue was photographed along with Tim Cook and the head of Disney Bob Iger at a billionaire's gathering in Sun Valley. All seemed jovial for the cameras of course. But behind the scenes, it's apparently a different matter. Disney, which owns channels such as ESPN and ABC, was stunned, though, when Apple executive Eddy Cue made demands that would have upended decades of cable-industry and Hollywood practices, people familiar with the discussions say. Eddy Cue had several meeting with all of the big networks at that retreat and one former Time Warner Cable executive reportedly said "Do you have any idea how this industry works?   I guess Eddy Cue took that seriously because Apple has confirmed this afternoon that they've hired former Time Warner Cable executive Peter Stern as a vice president working on cloud services, which includes the technology company's subscription offerings such as Apple Music and a potential streaming television service.   The Wall Street Journal reports this afternoon that "Mr. Stern will report to Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of internet software and services.   Mr. Stern, who is 44 years old, left Time Warner Cable earlier this year after it was bought by rival cable company Charter Communications Inc.

The 50 pages of e-mails were handed to Mic by an Apple employee, and obviously, all people involved have been anonymised. "With such love for a company that does so much good, it is with a heavy heart that I declare my resignation from Apple," a former employee wrote in an email obtained by Mic. "Despite all attempts to seek justice within this corporation, the cries of several minority employees about the toxic and oppressive environment have gone unanswered. I have witnessed the complete and utter disenfranchising of the voices of men and women of color and the fault lies not only in the direct management staff but in the response of those tasked with protecting employee rights. I write this letter hoping to highlight the areas that these departments have failed to properly support employees and as such have hence left Apple, Inc. culpable for various EEOC and ethical violations." According to Claire*, "several people" who have quit, citing a "white, male, Christian, misogynist, sexist environment," were not given exit interviews. "Their departure is being written up as a positive attrition," she told Mic. This obviously - but sadly - doesn't surprise me in the slightest. Silicon Valley is an inherently toxic environment dominated by white males, and despite all the talk from Tim Cook and various company bloggers, Apple is not the special diversity flowerchild farting rainbows and puking unicorn dust it claims to be. I mean, this is a company who considers having a Canadian speaking on stage during an event as "diversity". From these emails, a picture emerges of a company culture actively trying to get women to leave, actively preventing them from getting into mid-level and top-level leadership positions. From everything I've ever heard about Silicon Valley culture - this is par for the course, no matter the company.

Earlier today, AAPL hit its 2016 high, peaking at $113.03, topping this year’s previous high of $112.10 on April 14. Shares were up for AAPL as such as 4.7 percent today, while Apple’s market capitilzaiton reached nearly $607 billion today. That puts it ahead of Alphabet ($535 billion) and Microsoft ($440 billion). AAPL’s recent peak comes in the buildup to the release of the iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, and Apple Watch Series 2 this Friday, September 16th. T-Mobile announced yesterday that pre-orders for the two new iPhones have shattered previous sales records, with orders coming in four times higher than the iPhone 6 did. The carrier also noted that the devices set a “single day sales record for any smartphone ever” in its history. Likewise, Sprint noted that it saw preorder numbers four times higher with the iPhone 7 than it did with the iPhone 6s. Specifically, orders were up 375 percent over the first three days of preorder availability compared to last year. Apple itself, however, won’t be reporting first weekend numbers this year. The company said in a statement that “initial sales will be governed by supply, not demand,” thus making first weekend numbers irrelevant to customers and investors. In addition to strong iPhone 7 preorder responses, Reuters points to Samsung’s recent struggles as perhaps another reason for AAPL’s growth. Samsung this month has been in the midst of a very public recall of its highly-anticipated Galaxy Note 7 flagship due to a number of devices exploding. Apple expects revenue of between $45.5 billion and $47.5 billion for its Q4 2016, down from last year’s $51.1 billion. Apple will report its Q4 2016 earnings sometime in October. It’s during this announcement that we should get a closer look at iPhone 7 and Apple Watch Series 2 numbers. AAPL will likely again shift following the earnings release, as well.

Fuelled by US wireless carriers' reports of strong early orders for the iPhone 7 as well as arch-rival Samsung Electronics' widely-publicised recall of potentially exploding Galaxy Note 7 smartphones, shares of Apple rose as much as 4.7 per cent to US$113.03 for a gain of 10 per cent in the past three days. Its market capitalisation reached nearly US$607 billion, compared to US$535 billion for Alphabet and US$440 billion for Microsoft. After sinking to a two-year low in July that had portfolio managers describing Apple as a value stock and no longer a growth play, shares of the world's most valuable listed company have since rebounded 25 per cent. On Tuesday, Sprint said pre-orders for the iPhone 7 were up nearly four times compared to last year's iPhone. T-Mobile said pre-orders rose nearly four times compared with its next most popular iPhone. Potentially adding to demand for Apple's products, China's quality watchdog said yesterday that Samsung would recall 1,858 of its Galaxy Note 7 phones due to its fire-prone batteries, expanding the list of countries where the devices have been recalled. “With the carriers telling Samsung owners that Samsung wants you to take your phone back into the store, well, people are going to look elsewhere,” said Longbow Research analyst Shawn Harrison. Specific details about sales of the new iPhone are scarce after Apple announced last week it would not release weekend sales data, saying the number was more a reflection of supply than demand. Also up yesterday were companies supplying chips and other technology for iPhones: Cirrus Logic rallied 4.3 per cent, Skyworks Solutions gained 3.8 per cent and Jabil Circuit added 2.8 per cent. With US consumers less eager than in the past to replace their devices, global smartphone shipments are likely to grow less than two per cent in 2016, compared to 10 per cent last year, according to market research firm IDC.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Thursday, 15 September 2016 | MYT 6:31 AM Global, US, Europe, stocks dip; US yield curve hits steepest in 2 months, Apple jumps Global stockd down: The Dow Jones industrial average ended down 31.98 points, or 0.18 percent, to 18,034.77, the S&P 500 closed off 1.25 points, or 0.06 percent, to 2,125.77 while the Nasdaq Composite added 18.52 points, or 0.36 percent, to 5,173.77. MSCI's all-country world stock index was down 0.1 percent, while European shares also ended down 0.1 percent. NEW YORK: The U.S. Treasury yield curve hit its steepest in more than two months on Wednesday, while world stock markets edged lower as investors fretted about future U.S. interest rate hikes. A jump in Apple shares, which briefly touched a 2016 high, limited losses in the S&P 500 index. Deepening worries over the ability of the world's major central banks to stimulate growth have triggered a rise in bond yields and sparked a bout of risk-off trading. Speculation about the timing of the Federal Reserve's next interest rate hike also has shaken investors following contrasting comments from Fed officials, even though interest rate futures indicate expectations for a rate hike at the U.S. central bank's Sept. 20-21 meeting are still low. "What you're seeing is a little preview for what will happen when the Fed does raise rates," said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Cornerstone Financial Partners. "People are starting to make changes to their portfolios." Investor optimism over the newest iPhone drove Apple shares up 3.5 percent to $111.77 and limited losses in U.S. stocks. Apple's market value peaked above $600 billion for the first time since April as Wall Street bet the technology company's newest iPhone would help shore up falling sales. The Dow Jones industrial average ended down 31.98 points, or 0.18 percent, to 18,034.77, the S&P 500 closed off 1.25 points, or 0.06 percent, to 2,125.77 while the Nasdaq Composite added 18.52 points, or 0.36 percent, to 5,173.77. MSCI's all-country world stock index was down 0.1 percent, while European shares also ended down 0.1 percent. Bayer closed off its highs after clinching a $66 billion deal to buy Monsanto. Monsanto shares were up 0.6 percent at $106.76. Euro zone bond yields rose across the board after European Central Bank Executive Board member Sabine Lautenschlaeger said the bank should hold off on new monetary easing measures. In the U.S. market, recent bond weakness ebbed on Wednesday after a dramatic selloff on Tuesday sent long-dated yields to three-month highs. Benchmark 10-year notes ended up 13/32 in price to yield 1.69 percent, down from 1.73 percent on Tuesday. Still, the gap between five-year note yields and 30-year bond yields widened to 125 basis points, the steepest curve since July 1. U.S. long-dated bonds have underperformed in the past month, in line with a steepening yield curve in Japanese government bonds. The U.S. dollar eased from an eight-day high against the yen as skepticism grew that the Bank of Japan would intensify its stimulative monetary policies next week. The dollar eased from a session high of 103.34 yen touched in early trading and was last down 0.18 percent against the Japanese currency at 102.35 yen. Oil prices fell, extending recent losses, after data showed large weekly builds in U.S. petroleum products that overshadowed a surprise draw in crude stockpiles. Brent crude futures fell $1.25, or 2.7 percent, to settle at $45.85 per barrel, while U.S. crude slid $1.32, or 2.9 percent, to settle at $43.58.- Reuters Tags / Keywords: Stocks , Earnings , Banking , Commodities , Economy , Foreign News , Corporate News , Investing , Markets You May Be Interested Ann Joo results in line with expectations Wall street stocks lifted by data, earnings Yellen remarks KLK posts offer document to MP Evans shareholders Malaysia intervenes to help sagging ringgit: official China badminton star Lin Dan apologises for affair with model while wife was pregnant Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Others Also Read US extends ZTE reprieve on exports curbs until Feb 27 Billionaire Widjaja family puts Singapore on the spot The Star's executive editor Soo Ewe Jin passes away Property Related advertisement Latest News Musa tables RM3.78bil surplus budget for Sabah SC appoints Gumuri as AOB executive chairman KLK posts offer document to MP Evans shareholders Malaysia’s Q3 net international investment improves to RM26.5bil MDEC and UOA Holdings to set up gaming hub Most Viewed in Business Ringgit continues slide Malaysia intervenes to help sagging ringgit: official Billionaire Widjaja family puts Singapore on the spot SC appoints Gumuri as AOB executive chairman Ringgit opens lower against US dollar Prince Alwaleed sees Saudi currency depeg as last resort MDEC and UOA Holdings to set up gaming hub KLK posts offer document to MP Evans shareholders Ringgit, KLCI continue to fall Market ends week lower advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online   Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

Enterprise BI Intelligence Events Trending Tech Insider Finance Politics Strategy Life Sports Video All × From To You have successfully emailed the post. 10 features in iOS 10 that business users will love Julie Bort Sep. 14, 2016, 6:16 PM 130,826 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple CEO Tim CookREUTERS/Robert Galbraith Apple's latest operating system for iPhone and iPad, iOS 10, is now available and full of new features. While it's fun to play with the new iMessage app, there's also new stuff for the people who use their iPhones and iPads for work and features for the IT people who manage fleets of devices for employees. Until a couple of years ago, Apple had sort of ignored this class of users. But when iPad sales started to wane, it looked around and saw a massive market: enterprises. It started signing partnerships to make its products more attractive to this group, including one with Cisco, announced a year ago. So iOS 10 includes some features from its work with Cisco, as well as a few other things that improve it as a device for work. View As: One Page Slides Better WiFi connections as you roam around a corporate campus with your device: The connection won't drop or stall if it needs to switch WiFi networks. This only applies to WiFi networks built with Cisco gear, but Cisco is the largest supplier of WiFi. Flickr/Kārlis Dambrāns More bandwidth for business apps: IT managers can "whitelist" the business apps installed on your phone. So when your co-workers in the next cubical are watching video or playing games, they won't overload the Cisco WiFi network. Your work app will get priority. Salesforce Overall, an iOS 10 device on a Cisco WiFi network will be up to 8 times faster roaming, Cisco says, and have 90% fewer web browsing failures, up to 66% more reliable calling. For IT folks, it will reduce the "management traffic overhead" on the WiFi network by half. Apple Beyond working better with Cisco Wifi, third-party work apps that use the phone can tap into Apple's CallKit API for VoIP apps. That means that these apps will work like more like phone on the lock screen, recent calls list, and favorite contacts list. Paul Szoldra/Tech Insider The IT department can also specify the default app to use for work related contacts and accounts. So it can be set up to use one app for work contacts, another for personal. ConceptsiPhone/YouTube IOS 10 can automatically transcribe voicemail messages, although this feature is rolling out slowly, not yet available to every user yet. YouTube/9to5Mac Siri is coming to your work apps, too. App developers can tap into Siri for voice controls. This is expected to be added to some apps that are popular for workers like WeChat, WhatsApp, Slack, and Uber. SlackSlack When iOS 10 is used with a Mac, you can view whatever page you were looking at in your web browser on your phone/iPad. It's like taking your PC browser with you to a meeting. Just double click the home button and click the Safari button. Business Insider With a Mac, your iOS 10 device can access files on your desktop and in your documents folder, though iCloud Drive. You will need to set this up on both devices. It basically sends your files to iCloud, so be sure you have enough iCloud storage for this if you use it. Getty The email app did not get a huge overhaul but did get one nice new feature: You can now filter email messages by read, unread, flagged, attachments, and VIP.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Twitter livestreaming video apps arrive for Apple TV, Xbox One, Fire TV Brittany A. Roston - Sep 14, 2016 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Twitter has launched livestreaming video apps for the Xbox One, Amazon Fire TV, and Apple TV, giving owners of those devices the ability to watch livestreaming videos from Twitter. This will include, says the company, Thursday Night Football games and livestreaming content from others like Campus Insiders, Bloomberg News, MLB Advanced Media, Pac 12 Networks, Cheddar, and the NBA. Twitter has been increasingly pushing livestreaming on its platform, with the NFL Thursday Night Football deal being a pretty major part of that. Rumor had it in August that we’d see those livestreamed games coming to Apple TV this autumn, and that has proven true, though only as part of a larger overall announcement. According to Twitter, these new apps will also bring the top Periscopes and Vines from around the world, as well as top tweets. The app can be used by anyone with a supported device regardless of whether they have a Twitter account or any for-pay TV subscriptions. There is a perk for Apple TV owners, however. Live premium video and tweet’d video clips will also be viewable via what Twitter describes as a “seamless side-by-side video experience” on Apple’s entertainment device. The apps are launching today in some markets globally; the Apple TV app has launched globally for the fourth-gen device, while the Xbox One app has launched in the US, UK, Canada, Mexico, Australia, and Brazil. If you have an Amazon Fire TV or Fire TV Stick, you’ll only be able to download the app if you’re in the US or UK.

Trader Pete Najarian said he believes Facebook has more momentum than Apple under CEO Mark Zuckerberg. The social media giant also has more products in its pipeline, Najarian said. Trader Tim Seymour said that in an environment where investors pay more attention to valuation, Alphabet is a better stock to own than Apple. He said the parent company of Google has a "phenomenal balance sheet" like Apple, but may be better priced relative to its valuation. Trader Dan Nathan agreed and said that Alphabet has more potential to break out. He said investors would get "more bang for their buck" than they would with Apple.

Apple has since confirmed the hire. Stern worked for Time Warner Cable 12 years, most recently in the role of EVP and Chief People, Product and Strategy Officer. He left the company in June after it was acquired by rival cabler Charter Communications. At Apple, Stern is going to directly report to software and services SVP Eddy Cue, according to the Journal. Part of his efforts could conceivably include work on a television service, which has been an on-again-off-again project for Apple for years. After trying for some time to directly license programming from key networks, Apple has more recently refocused its efforts towards providing the infrastructure for third-party services to run on with its Apple TV device. At the same time, Apple has also been slowly increasing its investment into original content, leading some to believe that the company may be testing the waters for the launch of a full-blown video service at some point down the line. But even without such efforts, it’s increasingly clear that Apple is getting serious about software and cloud services, including Apple Music and its own iCloud storage service. Revenue from Apple’s services surpassed the money that the company is making with computers for the first time earlier this year.

The report looked at how the two U.S. technology giants, as well as others that control platforms through which smartphone applications are sold, use their positions of power to decide what app developers can and cannot do, Nikkei reported. (http://s.nikkei.com/2cYRX2s) Restricting what payment methods developers can accept and limiting their pricing freedom may not directly violate Japan's anti-monopoly law, but these practices lead to elimination of competitors, Nikkei reported. Japan's competition watchdog intends to investigate further and "may choose to conduct on-site inspections if there is sufficient suspicion of regulation breach," Nikkei reported, citing a high-ranking official.

(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) FILE - In this Monday, July 6, 2015, file photo, a man uses a mobile phone while walking by a building in the Financial District in New York. U.S. stocks are slightly higher in early trading Wednesday, Sept. 14, 2016, as utility companies climb. Energy companies are trading lower as the price of oil continues to slip. Stocks are at their lowest levels in two months after large losses in two of the previous three days. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) Single page Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (1) New York • U.S. stocks surrendered early gains and finished mostly lower Wednesday as energy companies skidded with the price of oil. Apple led technology companies higher. The mixed finish came after three days of big, erratic moves. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 96 points about an hour after trading began, but those gains slipped away as the day wore on. The price of oil fell about 3 percent for the second day in a row and energy companies fell with it. Household goods companies also slipped. Bond yields decreased after a big gain the day before, and high-dividend utility stocks made gains. VIDEOS TOP JOBS Investors have sent stocks in different directions as they wonder if the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next week, and they're also speculating about the health of the global economy. Bonds also reflected that confusion as they changed direction again. Yields fell and prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.70 percent. A day earlier it jumped to 1.73 percent, the highest in almost three months. David Lefkowitz, senior equity strategist at UBS Wealth Management Americas, said investors aren't sure what the Federal Reserve and central banks in Europe and Japan will do. But he said they're expecting higher interest rates, or at least less economic stimulus. "There's now a growing consensus that perhaps we're looking at a rising interest rate environment rather than a falling one," he said. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 31.98 points, or 0.2 percent, to 18,034. The Standard & Poor's 500 index dipped 1.25 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,125.77. The Nasdaq composite climbed 18.51 points, or 0.4 percent, to 5,173.77. After four months of public negotiations, seed and weedkiller maker Monsanto agreed to be bought by German drug and farm chemical company Bayer for $57 billion in cash. Bayer makes a wide range of crop protection chemicals that kill weeds, bugs and fungus, while Monsanto is known for its seeds business and the weedkiller Glyphosate. It rose 66 cents to $106.76. Benchmark U.S. crude lost $1.32, or 2.9 percent, to finish at $43.58 a barrel in New York. That came after a 3 percent drop on Tuesday. The international standard, Brent crude, fell $1.25, or 2.7 percent, to $45.85 a barrel in London. Energy companies also as well. Chevron gave up $1.01, or 1 percent, to $98.42 and Murphy Oil lost $1, or 3.8 percent, to $25.14. Drugstore chains Walgreens fell $1.27, or 1.5 percent, to $80.98 and CVS Health shed $1.49, or 1.6 percent, to $89.44. Apple picked up $3.88, or 3.6 percent, to $111.83, for its second day of big gains. Apple rose Tuesday after T-Mobile said it's getting strong preorders for the new iPhones. Apple gets most of its revenue from the iPhone, and those sales, while still enormous, have finally started to decline in the last year. That's hurt Apple stock, which traded above $130 a little more than a year ago. Stocks are at their lowest levels in two months after big losses Friday and Tuesday. In between came a big gain on Monday. "We're just kind of reverting back to a normal level of volatility," Lefkowitz said. "We got almost lulled to sleep because things were so unusually quiet in the last six weeks of the summer." Dermatology drug developer Vitae Pharmaceuticals soared to $20.85 after it agreed to be bought by Allergan, the maker of Botox. The deal values Vitae at $21 per share, or $606 million. Vitae, which doesn't have any approved products, closed at $8.10 on Tuesday. Allergan rose $4.71, or 2 percent, to $244.81. Ford dipped 24 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $12.14 after it said its pretax profit will fall this year. Ford also said its results will weaken further in 2017 as the company invests more money in electric and autonomous cars and its costs rise. The automaker expects results to start improving in 2018. Cracker Barrel Old Country Store gave up $10.55, or 7 percent, to $139.98 after investors weren't impressed with the restaurant chain's projections for the current fiscal year. » Next page...

image/svg+xml MAGAZINE EVENTS PAPERS TOPICS SEARCH Applications Competition Grows in the Map App Arena Although Google and Apple have the most popular GPS apps for smartphones, several other competitors have entered the market focusing on new and novel features. by George Avalos, The Mercury News / September 14, 2016 0 Flickr/Sal Petruzelli Marino/Waze map altered to show Los Angeles (TNS) -- When it comes to map apps, consumers are finding plenty of fresh paths to digital navigation thanks to Google, Apple and a whole host of rivals. Here WeGo, Waze, MapFactor, Mapquest, Scout GPS, Maps.Me and InRoute are just some of the apps that are challenging Google Maps and Apple Maps, which dominate smartphone mapping services, by focusing on new and novel features. The Players The two big map apps for the major phone platforms are the widely used Google Maps for Android and iPhone, and Apple Maps for the iPhone. Google Maps // What’s new: The ability to add interim stops to a destination, as well as estimates for how much time the detour will add to the trip. Apple Maps // What’s new: Apple upgrades, include an interim stops feature; users who want a reminder of where they parked their car can use a pin drop as a target. These free map apps attempt to challenge, or at least seek to address some shortcomings of, the two primary programs from Google and Apple. Waze // What’s new: A cleaner and fresh look, with quick access to frequent destinations; a new way to share your ETA with others. MapQuest // What’s new: Users can get speed limits to appear on their screens, including if you’re in a school zone. The route ahead is shown in what is called “2.5D” which Mapquest calls the “Perspective View.” Distance to a location now automatically updates. HERE WeGo // What’s new: Now easier to pick a destination and scroll to the mode of transportation. The app also offers ride-booking company Car2Go, as well as info on taxi services. MapFactor // What’s new: Better alternative route calculation; improved Google searches; the icon highlights when searching for a point of interest. Scout GPS // What’s new: Although turn-by-turn navigation is available, the app focuses on social interactions. Among the new features: You can send messages to friends and family; drive to the location of friends and family; share your location, route and real-time ETA; and ask a friend to pick you up. MAPS.ME // What’s New. The navigation elements take up less space; speed is now displayed; and an autozoom element has been added; bicycle riders can see terrain data; search results show hotel ratings and prices. inRoute // What’s New: Custom routes that let people avoid the heat on a summer road trip, or for those towing a trailer, ways to avoid steep hills; users can also chose routes with a lot of curves. Citymapper // What’s New: Travelers can get alerts about disruptions on transit systems in a city. Google and Apple, though, aren’t content to stay in the slow lane of innovation. Both have added new features to their map apps in recent months, including enabling users to add interim destinations to go along with the ultimate stop on a trip. Google’s changes rolled out in an update to Google Maps this summer; Apple’s changes will be included in iOS 10, the soon-to-be released next version of its mobile operating system. “Just open the app, enter a destination, tap the corner menu, and then click add a stop,” Google says in a blog post. “To rearrange the order of your stops, tap and hold the three-dot menu to the left of Add Stop and drag it to the position you want.” The Apple Maps service has new features that seek to meld activities and services associated with a trip. “Apps like OpenTable can integrate bookings right into Maps,” Apple says on its website. “Services like Uber and Lyft can make it easier for users to book a ride, without ever leaving the Maps app.” And while this navigational arms race shifts into high gear, it’s become apparent the original stand-alone GPS devices are becoming stranded by the side of the road. The proliferation of smartphone apps has reshaped a market once dominated by the stand-alone machines, such as TomTom, Garmin and Magellan. According to market research firm Berg Insight, worldwide shipments of personal navigation devices has decreased from 40 million units in 2008 to a projected 11 million by the end of this year. That number is expected to drop to just 7 million in 2019 — less than a tenth of projected smartphone map app users in that year. “Most consumers are using their smartphones as their primary navigation and map system,” said Ben Bajarin, an analyst with Creative Strategies, a market researcher. “Retailers, in a lot of cases, don’t really promote the stand-alone devices any more.” The established map apps from Google and Apple offer a wide array of features, with the centerpiece being turn-by-turn navigation. And while the emerging apps also typically offer turn-based directions, they all attempt to offer niche features that also can go beyond the basics of the apps from the tech titans. Google-owned Waze, whose service is separate from Google Maps, emphasizes the social aspects of traveling, and its new features include improved ways to share your estimated time of arrival with others. It also provides quick access to frequent destinations. “You can use Waze to find out about lots of things,” Bajarin said. “It pops up icons to tell you about traffic, police in your area, gives you suggestions on alternate routes. It’s the integration of social media with navigation.” Other apps also seek to meld the drive with other services. Scout GPS emphasizes social interaction, including the ability to message friends and family and share your location or destination with designated people. Here WeGo allows you to summon taxicabs or access a ride-hailing service. And some apps focus on improving the driving experience. Mapquest, one of the first computer-based navigation guides, recently began allowing drivers to see speed limits on the street they’re traveling. Maps.Me has added navigation elements that take up less space on the screen, and the speed the vehicle is traveling has been added. InRoute, designed mainly for long road trips, offers the ability to add numerous stops — and drivers can easily select routes that avoid areas with hot temperatures or hilly terrain. Saying it makes “cities easier to use,” Citymapper is geared to the daily commuter. In addition to vehicle navigation, the app has found a way to coordinate public transit and ride-hailing services so people can plan integrated trips. Citymapper’s service can be especially handy in big cities with major transit networks, said Michael Tchong, founder of Las Vegas-based Ubercool Innovation, which tracks technology trends. “The wave of the future is Citymapper,” Tchong said. “It integrates vehicle navigation, buses, subways, trains, Uber, Lyft all in one package. It will tell you whether the train you are on is running on time.” Experts predict the pace of innovation will pick up even more for map apps. “The map apps could become automated and start working as soon as you turn on your phone,” said Rob Enderle, an Oregon-based analyst who tracks the tech sector. “That way, if you’re driving, you don’t have to juggle a bunch of apps.” And map apps also may become more closely attuned to their users. They might start taking note of what types of restaurants you visit and only suggest those when you’re looking for a place to eat, Bajarin said. “The unique personalization of mapping is the next step,” he said. “We are on that cusp.” ©2016 The Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

Million.” He was, of course, referring to the streaming service’s paid subscribers, up 10 million after reaching the 30 million milestone this March. A Spotify spokesperson confirmed the figures to Complex. 10 million subscribers (or 33% growth) in just under six months is an enormous feat for a streaming service. The rate of growth points to a growing industry and audience for streaming music, but more importantly, it suggests that Spotify is outpacing its primary rival: Apple Music. Just last week, Apple announced that it had amassed 17 million subscribers on its own streaming service. It trails Spotify’s overall numbers, but that’s not surprising—Apple Music just launched last June, while Spotify has been around since 2008. Apple knew when it launched the streaming service that its Swedish competition had quite the headstart. However, what is notable from Ek’s numbers today is that Spotify appears to be growing faster than its well-heeled counterpart. Apple’s 17 million subscribers announcement comes just months after its last disclosure: 15 million, back in June, up from 11 million in February. Which means that the service gained 6 million subscribers in 7 months. It’s serious growth—Apple Music is the benchmark for how quickly streaming can expand from scratch—but it’s growing more slowly than Spotify (10 million subscribers in 6 months) for the first time since its launch. This flies in the face of conventional logic; many assumed that Apple Music, the streaming service that comes pre-installed (although not paid for, outside a free trial) on millions and millions of iPhones, would make up its starting line deficit easily. Of course, subscription numbers aren’t everything. Spotify still faces a difficult route to an IPO, and negotiations over royalty rates with major labels still pose a significant hurdle to reaching profitability. Apple, on the other hand, has a near-unlimited amount of money in its war chest, and in some ways it’s better to think of Apple Music as another incentive to keep its customers using iPhones, and every other Apple product under the sun, than a standalone business. Still, the surge in subscriptions for Spotify could pose a rebuttal to the efficacy of exclusives, a hot-button issue in the streaming economy. Just a few weeks ago, Apple Music received its highest profile streaming exclusive yet: Frank Ocean’s Blonde (and Endless), one of 70 releases this year that were available on Apple Music and Apple Music alone. While exclusives have certainly raised the profile of Apple Music (and of Tidal, which is currently going through its own growing pains), Spotify’s rapid recruitment of new, paying listeners suggests that content available only in one place may not be the audience builder some believed. Spotify, thus far, has refrained from entering the exclusives fray with Apple Music and Tidal, opting instead to wait out the exclusivity period for albums from Ocean, Drake, and Kanye West.

Stern will report to Eddy Cue and will carry a vice president title working on tasks related to Apple’s growing cloud services, including Apple Music. Stern left Time Warner Cable earlier this year follow its acquisition by Charter Communications. At Time Warner Cable, Stern served in senior strategy and corporate development roles throughout his time. Most recently, however, Stern served as chief product, people, and strategy officer, helping “implement a strategy faced on consumer service” in an effort to grow Time Warner’s cable TV subscriber numbers. Prior to working at Time Warner Cable, Stern worked at Time Warner Inc, the former parent company of Time Warner Cable. He holds a J.D. from Yale Law School and attended Harvard and received a degree in English and music. The former Time Warner Cable executive has long been vocal about cable companies needing to be more willing to offer apps on third-party set-top boxes such as the Apple TV, as opposed to leasing propriety cable boxes. In fact, Stern was heavily involved in conversations between Apple and Time Warner Cable as the two companies considered working together on a set-top box. The hiring of Stern makes a lot of sense for Apple as it continues to grow its subscription efforts and exclusive content. While Apple Music recently reached 17 million subscribers, the company is also working towards launching a series of exclusive content, such as its Planet of the Apps TV show. It’s unclear, however, whether his appointment means Apple will refocus efforts on launching a streaming television service. Mr. Stern’s role will cover cloud services generally, including other areas like iTunes, iCloud and Apple Music. Apple and Cue have also worked in the past to launch a streaming skinny bundle of TV stations, but the service has never come to fruition. Apple apparently had trouble negotiating with TV networks, so the hiring of Stern could lend helpful to those talks, should Apple still be interested in launching the streaming web TV package. For now, Apple has been focused on having networks create apps for the tvOS Apple TV.

 Apple just made a big hire that could mean it’s serious about taking on cable Kif Leswing Sep. 14, 2016, 5:43 PM 11,695 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple CEO Tim Cook and SVP Eddy Cue Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images Apple has hired a former Time Warner Cable executive in what could signal an expanded push into streaming video and other online services. Peter Stern, who was most recently chief product, people, and strategy officer at Time Warner Cable but left when it was bought by Charter Communications, has joined Apple, an Apple spokesperson confirmed to Business Insider. Stern will be a vice president at Apple and will focus on cloud services, including iTunes, iCloud, and Apple Music, according to The Wall Street Journal, which first reported the move. The hire is sure to reignite speculation that Apple is preparing its own streaming television service, a closely-watched expansion into a lucrative new market which has never been confirmed by the company. Stern will report to Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president in charge of online services, who previously led talks with cable providers to create a TV service. Stern was one of the Time Warner Cable executives who had negotiated with Apple. But Apple's streaming TV project has reportedly been put on the backburner, and last year's Apple TV launched without an Apple-branded streaming video service.  SEE ALSO: Apple has completely changed its plan to conquer TV NOW WATCH: Scientists attached a camera to a polar bear and revealed this never-before-seen footage Loading video...

(MIKE SEGAR/REUTERS) Leonard Greene NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Wednesday, September 14, 2016, 5:36 PM How ironic is it that the same company that refused to help the government by hacking the San Bernardino gunman's iPhone just made a huge political statement by doing away with its gun emoji? Ironic or not, Apple got it right. Both times. If Apple CEO Tim Cook cared so much about attacking America's gun problem, he would have helped the FBI unlock a phone with potential clues to where at least some terrorists are getting their weapons. That's the argument. Apple's iOS 10 update is already causing problems But, in truth, the two issues have as much to do with each other as iOS 10 — Apple's newly-released operating system — and sending a fax. By refusing to unlock the phone of terrorist Syed Farook, who, along with his wife killed 14 people in December, Apple forced government agents to do what they should have been able to do all along — figure it out for themselves. Cook also avoided a dangerous precedent that would have given the FBI a key to every user's sensitive data. As for the emoji, let's stop pretending that Apple has abridged our Second Amendment right to bear arms by eliminating the pistol from its emoji arsenal. San Bernardino killers nearly stopped by 3 men who rushed them Some irate iPhone users went online to stick to their guns. “Luckily Apple ended gun violence by removing the pistol emoji,” posted Twitter user Jeremiah Day. “Hopefully they'll end cancer by getting rid of the cigarette emoji next.” Apple's iOS 10 update will remove the gun emoji. “Okay now lets see how much less terrorism we will have after we got rid of the gun emoji,” tweeted a user named Sam. Apple is simply making a small statement about the scourge of guns in society, which is far more than we can say about a congress that refuses to pass meaningful gun-control legislation. Apple to unveil new iPhone — possible Apple Watch 2 — on Sept. 7 Months earlier, Apple joined other tech companies, including Facebook and Microsoft, in opposing a proposal from the governing body in charge of emojis to add a rifle picture. Last year, New Yorkers Against Gun Violence started a campaign to get Apple to replace its version of the pistol emoji, and sent an open letter to remove the firearm emoji "as a symbolic gesture to limit gun accessibility." Apple, to its credit, got on board, taking its stance even further by replacing the gun icon with a harmless toy pistol emoji. “The gun nuts, they were making fun of all this, but I think symbols are important," said Leah Barrett, NYAGV's executive director. “Our culture is saturated with images of guns whether it's Hollywood, advertisements. We’re a very violent society and guns contribute to that violence. And we’re not just talking about criminals.” Last year, a Brooklyn teen was arrested for posting a police emoji with pistol emojis pointing at his head, an obvious threat against police officers. Although, the charges were later dropped, it’s hard to imagine a repeat offense with a laughable lime green squirt gun.

So, if Apple’s new iPhone and software update didn’t exactly drop your jaw to the floor, you could be forgiven for not wanting to update your device. But what if we told you that you were only seeing most of what the iPhone 7 has to offer? What if there were some useful yet subtle tricks that could enhance your iPhone experience? Two Apple fans camping out in front of the Apple Store in Berlin, Germany, September 14, 2016. [Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images] Never Miss A Moment Raise your hand if you’ve ever had this problem: You see something cute/cool/awesome and try to snap it with your iPhone, but it moves/gets obstructed/is over before you can open the camera. No need to worry any longer; the camera app can be opened very easily on the iPhone 7. As BusinessInsider.com found, you only need to slide right from the lock screen using the new iPhone. Happy snapping! Just Say “No” To Bloatware Apple’s new iPhone also allows you to disable built-in apps that you don’t want. You can do this the same way you’d delete any other app, by holding your finger on it until the “x” appears. This is useful if you don’t want apps in your way, or if they seem to be hindering your phone’s performance. Just be sure to be careful what you delete as some apps are needed for optimal functioning. However, if things like Newsstand or Stocks are in your way, there’s no harm in disabling them and you can always get them back on your device.

[Photo by Stephen Lam/Getty Images], Redefining “Punching The Clock” Did you know Apple’s iOS 10 also has a hidden function for night owls? Using the clock app can help you keep your sleep schedule on track. Because of the way our internal clocks work, sleeping on a consistent schedule makes getting up in the morning (slightly) easier. That’s why Apple has introduced the Bedtime feature to the iPhone 7. As the IndiaTimes.com discovered, this improvement will remind you to go to sleep on time. Water resistant #iPhone7 and waterproof #AppleWatch are great, but a water resistant MacBook would be a game changer. — Peter Cohen (@flargh) September 14, 2016 Better sleep isn’t just good for your internal clock, though; studies have shown it can lead to overall health benefits like weight loss, lowered risk for health complications, and of course, more energy during the day. You can thank your iPhone 7 and iOS 10 for better sleep. This award-winning photojournalist puts the iPhone 7 Plus's camera to the test https://t.co/tVcGBxOczG pic.twitter.com/O9NGU9Y2XD — Fast Company (@FastCompany) September 14, 2016 Not Sure If Cool Or Terrifying Facial Recognition has been coming into its own lately, and Apple hasn’t failed to notice. That’s why iOS 10 has a new (awesome?) feature that recognizes you and your friends in Photos. As MacWorld.com will tell you, this feature then groups pictures by who’s in them so you can search for, say, that one Christmas party photo that should never see the light of day. ???????????? A photo posted by ᗇᔛᒷᕜᕜᕈ (@asleepinthemuseum) on Sep 14, 2016 at 5:43am PDT Tech giants like Facebook and Google have also been developing better facial recognition software for the same purpose, and companies like HP even have laptops that can be unlocked using facial recognition software. Sorta like what we thought the year 2000 would be like in 1990. Use The Force No, Apple didn’t suddenly give iOS 10 a Star Wars theme (we can dream). What it did do is let you change the intensity your flashlight shines at, according to TechCrunch. To do so, you’ll wanna use the Force — Force Touch. Introduced in the iPhone 6S, this convenient little feature changes how an iPhone reacts based on the pressure applied. It’s not just for flashlights, but in this case, tapping allows you to select bright, medium, or low-intensity beams.

(@biz_mobile1) on Sep 14, 2016 at 1:51pm PDT Rule of Thumb In the honorable mention category for “things that sound like Jedi abilities” is 3D Touch. As igeeksblog.com notes, this iPhone improvement adds the ability to act on an app by firm pressing it without having to enter said application. Pretty cool, but if you don’t like or want it, there’s also the ability to turn it off. Access your Settings menu, then tap Accessibility–>3D Touch and flip the switch on or off. <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CHCQO4zfkiE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> Helpful Siri Is Helpful This little hack might the best of all, because you don’t have to do anything to activate it other than use it. Your iPhone’s Siri app is now integrated tightly with a variety of 3rd-party apps, so you can make requests of other programs right from the voice assistant menu. The (non-exhaustive) list of apps that interface with iPhone include LinkedIn, Lyft, Uber, and payment app Venmo. More apps will likely be added to this list as time goes on and iPhones become more refined. Siri also seems to be going the direction of predicting what you need before you need it, so opening it up to 3rd-party apps could lead to some interesting developments.

The Apple 5th Avenue location in New York, one of Apple’s flagship locations, has people who have been waiting days in advanced with folding chairs, small one-person tents, and people saving spots. Other locations aren’t seeing as many customers in line. At another Appel retail location, Apple Union Square, a handful of customers are already waiting for the iPhone 7. People supposedly started lignin up over the weekend. The most popular iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus models in Jet Black go as far as November in terms of shipping times online. So standing in line and waiting may be your only option if you haven’t pre-ordered yet. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are set to launch on Friday, September 16, and will debut first in Australia. It’s already Thursday morning in the country, so there’s less than a day to go.

The first update of the three introduces improvements in Messages, Photos, Siri and Maps. It boasts of new features like ‘Raise to Wake’, Memories in Photos, and 3D Touch which has been extended to various apps. iOS 10 brings in maximum changes to the messaging service in Apple products. The update adds personalization elements like animations running over the whole screen and handwritten notes into chats. It also has enabled Tapback that displays six options from which a reply can be chosen. iMessages now predicts emojis in conversations. Emoticons replace text in chats with just a tap. Other services like payments or photo editor are accessible without leaving the messaging app. Apple is also introducing a range of stickers that can be added in conversations or on photographs. The Apple-developed virtual assistant Siri has been modified to cover more apps like Lyft and CarPlay. It can perform functions directed by the user’s voice inside any application. The ‘Raise to Wake’ feature displays notifications the moment the iPhone is picked up. You can also see the various media in a message from the alerts on the screen itself. Photos has received several additions through iOS 10. The Memories feature in the app sorts and displays older photos from albums according to user preferences. They are combined into slideshows or videos to be shared across various platforms. While iOS 10 was being rolled out to the world, early installers of the update had to face a serious problem in their devices. Their gadgets simply could not download the upgrade over wireless connectivity and users ended up having to connect their handsets to their PCs to restore the OS. Several images of the bricked iPhones and iPads were uploaded on social media to warn users against downloading it. Apple’s website is currently displaying a method to recover the temporarily unusable devices. The tech giant recommends downloading iOS 10 from PC-installed iTunes for such gadgets. It is worth waiting for a few days before upgrading. In addition to the new OS for iPhones and iPads, watchOS 3 has also been introduced for Apple Watches. The update is likely to ensure faster performance and longer battery life in the wearables. The fourth generation of Apple TV will receive the new tvOS 10 with added features on the remote app. TAGS apple iOS iOS 10 iPad iPhone tvOS 10 watchOS 3 SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleMoto E3 Power confirmed for India launch on September 19 Next articleIdea agrees to provide RJio with 196 PoI after meeting with TRAI Rohit Panshikar RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR iPhone 6 gets a price cut in India Airtel selling iPhone 7 for Rs 19990, sort of Reliance Jio, Airtel to offer free services on iPhone Trending Vivo V5 with 20MP selfie camera launched in India Rohit Panshikar - Nov 15, 2016 The flagship Vivo V5 with a 20MP front camera was unveiled in Mumbai today for a price of Rs 17980.

Following reports that iPhone 7 pre-orders at both T-Mobile and Sprint shattered existing records, we’re now learning that pre-orders for Apple’s new iPhone are also doing incredibly well over at AT&T. During a Bank of America Merrill Lynch sponsored webcast on the state of Media, Communications and Entertainment, AT&T CFO John Stephens said that the popularity of the iPhone 7 has already exceeded Ma Bell’s expectations. DON'T MISS: 25 tips and tricks to get the most out of iOS 10 “The reality is as one of the biggest providers of the iPhone services, our sales are up,” Stephens said in a statement relayed by CNBC. “We have seen a real improvement, exceeding our expectations, Now we've got a promo out there, and you would hope the promos would be effective and they certainly are.” Earlier in the week, Sprint said that iPhone pre-orders were up 375% year over year. Meanwhile, T-Mobile CEO John Legere said that pre-orders for the iPhone 7 are 4x bigger than what the company experienced with the iPhone 6. “This has been the biggest launch ever for us,” Legere said. “The first four days of the iPhone 7 launch are by far the biggest ever for T-Mobile. It’s four times bigger than the iPhone 6 for us, at this stage.” Naturally overjoyed, Legere went so far as to call the unprecedented demand for the iPhone 7 a phenomenon. With iPhone pre-orders impressing at the above 3-carriers, you may be wondering how things are over at Verizon. Well, during the aforementioned webcast, Verizon executive Marni Walden said that iPhone 7 pre-orders are strong but are within line with previous years. Per CNBC, Walden’s exchange with the event moderator reads as follows: Moderator: "Some of the competitors in the market have been talking about 4x increases in volumes for iPhone sales. The media has assumed that this is a function of $0 trade-ins and inferring maybe that there is big market share movements or big margin implications for the industry. I wonder if you can speak maybe to, what is Verizon's iPhone experience? Has this been a game changer, or what's the story?" Walden: "I think when people talk about percentages increase it's all about, 'Compared to what?' If you look at Verizon, we had the iPhone second, so your upgrade cycles depend a lot on that, how big your base is, so you know, we're not going to comment on volume, but I would say you've got to ask the question of what it's compared to …." Moderator: "Would you say this is a churn and margin impact for Verizon, or is it more a business as usual upgrade cycle for the iPhone?" Walden: "We think it's more of a business as usual for us." All told, the iPhone 7 is lining up to be a tremendous and perhaps surprising success. What’s more, news of record-setting pre-orders come at a crucial time for Apple. After seeing iPhone sales rise year after year, the iPhone 6s in 2016 ushered in the company’s first decline in iPhone sales in history. With reports of strong iPhone 7 sales, shares of Apple have been trending upward this week. At the close of trading on Wednesday, Apple shares were trading at $111.77, up 3.54% for the day and up nearly 8% since the beginning of September.

clock menu more-arrow Who will buy Twitter? We ranked all the possible buyers. So glad you asked. by Kurt Wagner and Kara Swisher Sep 14, 2016, 4:37pm EDT Image credit: Recode tweet share Linkedin Twitter's board is leaning toward making a sale with possible suitors including Google and Salesforce, amongst other tech companies, as CNBC's David Faber reported Sept. 23. The stock was up as much as 20 percent after the report. The following story, which ran Sept. 14, breaks down all the likely (and unlikely) buyers and why. At pretty much every recent dinner party, tech gathering and social shindig where we have run into the digital elite, everyone seems to have the same question: What's going to happen to Twitter? The travails of the San Francisco-based social communications company have been an ongoing soap opera for a long time now, one that has gotten Google-sized attention despite its relatively small size and tech impact. Like the slow-moving train wreck of Yahoo, to which Twitter is increasingly compared, it’s partly due to the media fascination with the company. And there is no doubt that the app’s social impact is immeasurable, especially in the way it holds a perpetual mirror in front of all the narcissists in the world (Trump! Kanye! Various and sundry VCs on Sand Hill Road!). Or, as former Twitter board member Mike McCue told us recently: "Twitter is a huge phenomenon more than it is a company." Ouch. Here’s the case for and against all the possible Twitter suitors that keep cropping up. But perhaps that's the truth, even as CEO Jack Dorsey and his top execs seek to bring growth and value back to the company he founded. It raises the question: What is going to happen to Twitter? At a projected $18 billion price tag, the options can be tough to imagine. Luckily, we did all the hard work for you! There is a caveat: So far, the company’s top brass has not wanted to sell and has indicated that the hope is to remain independent. But because it’s Twitter, that did not stop Dorsey’s co-founder and director Evan Williams from setting off a ruckus after he was asked about a possible sale. Williams no-commented and then noted that the board would "consider the right options." No surprise, the non-answer caused the stock to pop. It’s down again, though, and the question now becomes whether anyone thinks there are actual buyers for the company. As one former exec there told us recently, sotto voce: "Twitter is the most invaluable company that no one really wants to buy." Double ouch. That’s not exactly true, which is why we put on our green-shade visors and did some investment banking of our own. While we may lack the gumption of the ever-wily Frank Quattrone, we make up for it in energetic guessing, larded with a lot of actual reporting. So here’s the case for and against all the possible Twitter suitors that keep cropping up. Google Justin Sullivan / Getty The case for Google (Kurt): There’s a good reason Google’s name always tops this list: It makes the most sense! Google has the money — Alphabet generated more revenue last quarter alone ($21 billion) than Twitter is actually worth. And while the company has tried its hand at social media before (I think we can all now agree that Google+ has been a minus), Twitter would give it a legitimate social platform to tie in with YouTube, which is now feeling heat from Facebook and Snapchat, which are very social. Could Google make good use of Twitter properties like Vine and Periscope by coupling them in some kind of media hybrid offering with YouTube? Maybe! Look how happy they are! Michael Kovac/Getty Images for Vanity Fair Google already understands the advertising business, so no problems there. Then imagine Twitter’s livestreaming pitch to the NFL and other major rights holders with Google’s backing on distribution. Google could essentially bring Twitter private, and allow it to fix whatever user and product problems it has away from the investor criticism that comes when you’re a public company. There’s a lot to like here. Haters like to point out that Alphabet CEO Larry Page doesn’t give a rip about social media, but he’s no longer running Google. Sundar Pichai is. Couple that with former Google exec Omid Kordestani now chairing Twitter’s board, and the whole Larry hates social argument may no longer mean much. The case against Google (Kara): Kurt, Kurt, Kurt. Larry no longer runs Google? When pigs fly perhaps, but today making a nearly $20 billion purchase is something the testy and robotic founder will most definitely need to weigh in on. And he does have disdain for social, for reasons that include the fact that no one at Google is social or understands the paradigm. But Google lost to Facebook a long time ago on that score, and Page seems to have decided that the company’s future is not in this direction. Rather, his recent hire of Diane Greene to compete with Amazon and others in the cloud and his artificial intelligence plays are the kind of all-in investments that make the most sense. And then there are the regulatory issues that come with any big Google purchase. Will the politicians in D.C. like Google owning all of search and the still-influential social platform upon which the recent election has been playing out? No, they will not. Ask the first Twitter presidential candidate, Donald Trump, if he’d like the Democratic-leaning Google to own his fave platform and he would blow a very large raspberry on the podium. Vanity aside, it’s not an acquisition that even the roll-over regulators of the various U.S. agencies will swallow easily. As for the hair-trigger Europeans? Nein! Non! Or, as persistent Google foe and European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager would surely declare: Ingen! Hand in glove with the many antitrust issues, there is the mass of publicity that comes with owning Twitter. It is watched by the media like no other company (largely because reporters love to talk about nothing more than themselves, even if no one else cares). While Google gets a lot of attention, the kind that Twitter gets is not the same and not welcome to the secretive nature of the search giant. And then there are the ugly controversies around abuse. While Google perhaps has the tech chops to help improve the tools to fix the ongoing debacle in this arena, it would take a massive PR effort that is simply not in the company’s wheelhouse. Google is all about the algorithm and Twitter is all about humanity. You see the disconnect here. Perhaps most simply, Google already has Twitter on its platform via search. Whether it needs more than that for that much money is a very good question. Facebook The case for Facebook (Kurt): Facebook does a lot of things really well. One of those things is selling and delivering mobile advertising, which, coincidentally, is how Twitter makes money. Facebook is also great at user growth — it has three separate billion-user products, plus Instagram, which has more than 500 million users. Twitter has been stuck right around 300 million monthly users for over a year and needs a serious distribution jolt. Facebook also does a lot of things well that Twitter wants to do, like video distribution and messaging. What Facebook doesn’t do well is what Twitter does best: Distributing breaking and real-time news. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg talked a lot on the company’s last earnings call about live video and immediacy around the news, but Facebook hasn’t figured it out, as evidenced by its trending topics nightmare that doesn’t seem to go away. Buying Twitter could help solve that problem and, at the very least, ensure the company doesn’t fall into a competitor’s hands (see: Google). The case against Facebook (Kara): Yes, the real-time news argument is a good one. But is solving it worth a $20 billion check? Or could Facebook just use the same tactics as it has in its complete lift of Snapchat Stories using its Instagram unit? It would be much harder, obviously, as replicating Twitter as a global news platform is not the same as copying hot software. But it is certain that Facebook probably has a lot of cheaper innovations to beating Twitter at news than the trouble it might buy with Twitter. Most central to that trouble is all the grief that would come with Twitter’s massive basket of deplorables. And we do mean deplorables here, and we’re not apologizing for saying so, because it is a cesspool of abuse and ugliness far too often. All those anonymous users spewing all that hatred is most definitely not amenable to Facebook’s walled-garden approach to social, which has been a huge success for it. And Facebook itself has been pretty bad about dealing with similar controversies over what it bans (see the recent mistake over the "napalm girl" photo). More complexity seems to be something that the company is incapable of dealing with, even if it introduces better tools. And as good as they are, neither Zuckerberg nor COO Sheryl Sandberg are equipped to handle the mass of controversy that Twitter brings with it. Plus, as with Google, there would be regulatory issues that would be tough to overcome. (Sorry, Elliot Schrage — you’re good, but not that good!) Facebook tried to buy Twitter a long time ago for $500 million. That was then. Microsoft Justin Sullivan / Getty The case for Microsoft (Kara): There is no real case, because what kind of problem does Twitter solve for Microsoft? None! The company is turning very clearly into an enterprise company, after many — so many — debacles in the consumer space. But okay, I’ll try. It would be nice for Microsoft to have some traction in social, in mobile and in ads. Maybe Twitter could be integrated in with LinkedIn, for which the software giant recently paid $26 billion, bringing in a savvy media-focused exec in its CEO Jeff Weiner. He’d surely have some ideas for it. But that’s all I got. The case against Microsoft (Kurt): Kara pretty much nailed it up top. Microsoft already broke the bank this year for an unprofitable social network in LinkedIn, so buying another one would be foolish. Microsoft hasn’t hit any home runs with other social and communication acquisitions, such as Yammer and Skype (does anyone actually use Skype on mobile?), and there’s nothing here to imply a Microsoft-owned Twitter would be any different. Plus, if Twitter is serious about getting into TV-style livestreaming, it would be better selling to a company with actual media experience. Plus plus, Microsoft is basically out of the online advertising industry. Its business is primarily driven by enterprise tools and services, not consumer brands, and making a splashy consumer play would be more distracting than anything. Apple Stephen Lam / Getty The case for Apple (Kara): This is an interesting question, given how beloved Apple is to Twitter’s Dorsey. He’s a longtime Steve Jobs fanboy and also has a lot of respect for the company today. A sale to Apple is one that you can see the recalcitrant Dorsey saying "yes" to more easily. Here’s what Twitter will help Apple with: A real-time news offering (Apple News is just awful); a livestreaming opportunity that it could tout on iPhones; a decent social presence and worldwide platform (remember Ping? I do, but only me!); an ad business that Apple can actually succeed with; a still-cool mobile app. It’s not hard to see how Apple could integrate Twitter with a lot of its services and make them instantly better. Still, Apple simply does not have a social media culture, and it would need Dorsey there to lead the efforts. And he has another job over at Square, as you might have heard. The case against Apple (Kurt): So, so wrong, Kara. Twitter doesn’t have a single thing Apple might want. Twitter is an advertising business, and Apple is not good at advertising. Twitter doesn’t have any hardware products, and owns virtually nothing when it comes to the kind of high-quality content Apple currently distributes, such as music, movies and television. Apple already offers a superior messaging product to Twitter, and has its own curated news app. And the abuse issues — not the Apple image at all. Maybe Twitter could make Apple a little cooler? But it would be cheaper to just buy something hip, like Carpool Karaoke (Oh, wait!). Big Pipes: Verizon or Comcast Justin Sullivan / Getty The case for Big Pipes (Kara): One major thing: Mobile streaming! It’s a thing, in case ya didn’t know! Let’s start with Verizon, which has so many billions of dollars of cash on its balance sheet and no idea what to do with it. Well, it did use about $10 billon of that to buy stumbling Internet brands AOL and Yahoo, and so far the market has not punished them for it. Why not double down with Twitter and make it a trifecta? Also, Verizon has the management that could actually coordinate it all, especially AOL CEO Tim Armstrong. He’d be helped if he could get Twitter execs like COO Adam Bain and CFO Anthony Noto to stay. Comcast is run by smart people (Disclaimer: NBCUniversal has a huge investment in Recode owner Vox Media) who like to buy value and, if not growth. That’s not Twitter these days, but one reason for them to buy it is that they have a lot of content and other stuff that would be great on the platform. Plus, regulators would let them buy the property, as opposed to video and TV companies, which Comcast can’t do much of. Twitter is not a video company, because wishing you are a video company does not make it so. Could it be someday? Maybe. While I think Verizon is a more likely buyer than Comcast, these would be big stretches for both, and therefore probably more trouble than it is worth. The case against Big Pipes (Kurt): For all the news Twitter has made around its livestreaming efforts, it’s a very minor player in the world of live video distribution. It doesn’t own any significant rights for any significant portion of time, and it isn’t creating new programming. The NFL broadcasts it's distributing aren’t even produced by Twitter — NBC and CBS handle that. Twitter is simply the platform for everyone else’s content, and we have no idea how large or how valuable Twitter’s audience actually is. When Yahoo streamed an NFL game back in 2015, the viewership numbers were terrible by NFL standards. There isn’t much reason (yet) to believe Twitter’s streams will fare any better. Add in the fact that Verizon has paid a combined $10 billion for Yahoo and AOL in the past 18 months. It could probably afford Twitter, too, but what a lineup of troubled companies that would be to fix. Big Media: News Corp/21st Century Fox, Disney Getty Images The case for Big Media (Kara): The case for big media buying Twitter? Because they are still old media, no matter how hard they try to pretend otherwise. When it comes to appealing to younger audiences (also known as digital audiences), even growth-starved Twitter beats them. The main reason for media companies to buy Twitter is that they don’t want another media company to buy Twitter and, good God, not Google or Facebook either, because then all that’s left is Snapchat (and Evan Spiegel is not selling, last time we checked). There has been a lot more noise about Rupert Murdoch’s Fox buying it than any other media giant, but that would be a big bet for him and his two sons. And while Disney has a taste for digital properties (Hello, Vice!) and while Dorsey is on the board of Disney, so is Facebook’s Sandberg. Would I like to be a fly on the wall of that board meeting? Yes! The case against Big Media (Kurt): How many traditional media companies can comfortably afford an $18 billion acquisition? Few. Twitter is likely too expensive for News Corp/Fox or Time Warner or Disney. Media organizations already get most of the benefits of Twitter’s product — free content distribution— without the headache that comes with running it. Plus, Twitter is hungry for any and all high-quality video content, which means rights holders like Turner (Time Warner) can easily ink deals with Twitter if need be. No need to open the checkbook. There’s also this: Twitter is valuable because media companies see it as a neutral platform. Imagine this scenario that one source jokingly suggested: "The Arab Spring live on Twitter, brought to you by Rupert Murdoch and Fox News!" Yeah, not so much. The Chinese Internet giants The case for a Chinese buyer (Kurt): Chinese tech companies are all looking for a foot in the door when it comes to monetizing U.S. consumers. Twitter could be that giant toe as a big trophy property! Tencent-owned messaging app WeChat, which dominates in China, has tried unsuccessfully to build a U.S. audience in the past, and appears to have given up that plan. Momo, another Chinese messaging service, has a similar story. That might make a company like Twitter, which has 66 million U.S. users and lots of business partnerships with U.S. advertisers, an attractive option to Chinese tech giants like Tencent, Alibaba and Baidu. The case against a Chinese buyer (Kara): Have you all heard about the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States? Well, welcome to the committee that would say "no" to such a deal tout de suite. As it notes on its website, "CFIUS is an inter-agency committee authorized to review transactions that could result in control of a U.S. business by a foreign person (‘covered transactions’), in order to determine the effect of such transactions on the national security of the United States." In other words: The deal busters. Simply put, the U.S. will not let Chinese interests own a global platform like Twitter. You think Trump is mean to the Mexicans? Imagine what he’d say about this sale. Same with Hillary Clinton and pretty much everyone else in D.C. Salesforce Justin Sullivan / Getty The case for Salesforce (Kurt): Well, Salesforce just bought Quip, whose CEO, Bret Taylor, recently joined Twitter’s board. Some people think he’d be a good fit to run Twitter’s core product, too, although he says he’s not interested. Otherwise ... I got nothing. Kara? The case against Salesforce (Kara): I got nothing. While CEO Marc Benioff likes to buy things, according to sources at Salesforce, these rumors about his interest in Twitter are just that, and such a purchase is unlikely. But it is a fun idea, because Benioff is fun! Private Equity Andy Dean Photography / Shutterstock The case for private equity (Kara): What a wonderful world it would be if Twitter could be run in a quiet place, instead of being perpetually naked in the middle of Times Square as it is now. It could cut costs, thin down, focus and maybe finally realize its very unrealized potential. All gone would be the persistent detractors (Saccattack!), the shareholder activists (who are gathering even now for a new attack), the irksome media (I blame myself) and all the leaky board members, employees, ex-employees and sundry players. Sounds dreamy? It is! Calling Silver Lake, stat! The case against private equity (Kurt): I blame Kara, too! The biggest issue here is price. Twitter is just too expensive as it stands right now for most private equity firms to justify purchasing. These kinds of deals usually happen when a business actually makes money — investors want some kind of return on their investment — and Twitter is still losing money each quarter. recode_divider Mergers and Acquisitions DraftKings and FanDuel are (officially) merging Broadband Here’s the secret to Starry Internet’s plan to beam the internet to your house and break up the broadband monopoly Podcasts Full transcript: Recode’s April Glaser talks drones on Too Embarrassed to Ask Chorus Terms of Use Privacy Policy Communications Preferences Contact Send Us a Tip Masthead Sponsorships Podcasts Newsletters All Systems Operational Check out our status page for more details.

A jump in Apple shares, which briefly touched a 2016 high, limited losses in the S&P 500 index. Deepening worries over the ability of the world's major central banks to stimulate growth have triggered a rise in bond yields and sparked a bout of risk-off trading. Speculation about the timing of the Federal Reserve's next interest rate hike also has shaken investors following contrasting comments from Fed officials, even though interest rate futures indicate expectations for a rate hike at the U.S. central bank's Sept. 20-21 meeting are still low. "What you're seeing is a little preview for what will happen when the Fed does raise rates," said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Cornerstone Financial Partners. "People are starting to make changes to their portfolios." Investor optimism over the newest iPhone drove Apple shares up 3.5 percent to $111.77 and limited losses in U.S. stocks. Apple's market value peaked above $600 billion for the first time since April as Wall Street bet the technology company's newest iPhone would help shore up falling sales. The Dow Jones industrial average ended down 31.98 points, or 0.18 percent, to 18,034.77, the S&P 500 closed off 1.25 points, or 0.06 percent, to 2,125.77 while the Nasdaq Composite added 18.52 points, or 0.36 percent, to 5,173.77. MSCI's all-country world stock index was down 0.1 percent, while European shares also ended down 0.1 percent. Bayer closed off its highs after clinching a $66 billion deal to buy Monsanto. Monsanto shares were up 0.6 percent at $106.76. Euro zone bond yields rose across the board after European Central Bank Executive Board member Sabine Lautenschlaeger said the bank should hold off on new monetary easing measures. In the U.S. market, recent bond weakness ebbed on Wednesday after a dramatic selloff on Tuesday sent long-dated yields to three-month highs. Benchmark 10-year notes ended up 13/32 in price to yield 1.69 percent, down from 1.73 percent on Tuesday. Still, the gap between five-year note yields and 30-year bond yields widened to 125 basis points, the steepest curve since July 1. U.S. long-dated bonds have underperformed in the past month, in line with a steepening yield curve in Japanese government bonds. The U.S. dollar eased from an eight-day high against the yen as skepticism grew that the Bank of Japan would intensify its stimulative monetary policies next week. The dollar eased from a session high of 103.34 yen touched in early trading and was last down 0.18 percent against the Japanese currency at 102.35 yen. Oil prices fell, extending recent losses, after data showed large weekly builds in U.S. petroleum products that overshadowed a surprise draw in crude stockpiles. Brent crude futures fell $1.25, or 2.7 percent, to settle at $45.85 per barrel, while U.S. crude slid $1.32, or 2.9 percent, to settle at $43.58.

Register Now Advertise Optimizing Nutrition Apps for Broad Consumer Adoption by Michael Bollinger, Columnist, September 14, 2016, 12:12 PM Recommend (3) Apple recently announced a partnership with Nike, linking its Apple Watch with the Nike+ running app. I wish more collaboration between tech giants, food and beverage manufacturers and grocery retailers were keeping nutrition apps apace.  Fitness apps have "crossed the chasm" between early adopters and the mainstream market because the technology has virtually disappeared, enabling the "rest of us" to use it easily and passively. Wearable sales surged 71% last year to 78 million units. The technology does a great job of tracking our exercise output and calorie burn with no necessary interaction on our part. But when it comes to matching nutrition intake to exercise output, the technology fails us. Once we step into the world of nutrition apps, forget passive tracking. Now we are asked to keep diaries, scan bar codes, manually enter restaurant meals, enter recipes. Puleez! Here's the nutrition and fitness app I want: The goal for all users is optimal health. There's too much emphasis on weight loss in nutrition apps. Weight loss is a strategy towards greater health, but not the ultimate goal. I would hope that the goal of optimal health would lead to a prescription of shopping and recipes based on Michael Pollan's rules for eating: “Eat food, not too much, mostly plants.” I enter only my (and my family's) height, weight, age and any food allergies. I'm presented with a week's shopping list, meals and recipe options based on a week's capture of my fitness activity. I accept a week of meals and check them off as they are consumed. Those I don't check off get a national average score that I won't like and will help check my departures from plan. No entering what I actually ate. My level of exercise would determine my next week's shopping list. By working hard and sticking to plan, my app would do what we do anyway — reward me with an occasional indulgence. I'm prompted to rate meals from time to time and the app feeds me more of what I like and less of what I do not. This approach changes the game from active to passive management. And from tracking calories and steps to optimizing health based on nutrition and exercise. I'm not telling the app what I'm consuming. The app tells me what to buy, what to make, how to make it and the exercise plan — based on age, height, weight and demonstrated fitness behavior — to integrate with diet.  With my nutrition and fitness app, I could place my week's grocery order with one click knowing that what I've bought is optimized for my (or my family's) health. And instructions for preparing each meal (and snack) just await my engagement. I know, I know. Sounds like I'm turning food into fuel — the emotional into the functional. And you'd be right. But left to our own designs, look where the emotional takes us. We don't need an app for mixing Cheez Doodles with a few Ding Dongs and washing it all down with a cold Bud. We got that. We struggle with buying the right foods and preparing those foods well. Apple has struggled in the wearables space, trailing Fitbit and Garmin. Apple recently announced a partnership with Nike to gain traction in the fitness space. Unveiling an updated Apple Watch last week, Apple COO Jeff Williams said, "We think Apple Watch is the ultimate device for a healthy life." But a healthy life isn't just about the number of steps we take or the miles we peddle. The foundation is the fuel that enables us to take those steps. Integrating nutrition and fitness into a single app is the ultimate device for a healthy life.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Real Estate Classifieds Site Archive Apple Valley's head of finance comes under fire Wednesday Sep 14, 2016 at 1:26 PM Sep 14, 2016 at 3:51 PM Matthew Cabe Staff Writer @DP_MatthewCabe APPLE VALLEY — A report released Tuesday by a group aligned with Liberty Utilities alleges that a key town official’s “failed tenure” as Flint, Michigan’s director of finance “contributed to financial disaster and ultimately poisoned water” in that city. The six-page report — released by the Apple Valley Citizens for Government Accountability — also contends a financial practice instituted by Marc Puckett during his tenure in Flint, which involved charging various accounts for things the general fund had paid for previously, is the same that “has been heavily criticized in the Town of Apple Valley” while Puckett has served as Assistant Town Manager in charge of finance. CGA is outspoken against the town’s eminent domain acquisition attempt of the water system owned by Liberty Utilities, Apple Valley, and CGA leadership said the report “should certainly put a damper on the Town of Apple Valley’s assurances that they can handle taking over the water system.” Town Manager Frank Robinson characterized the report as a personal and mean-spirited attack made by “those on the losing side of a critical public policy issue.” “These character attacks have no bearing whatsoever on the exhaustive and transparent studies, legal briefs, appraisals and other reports that have presented to the public and the Town Council regarding acquisition of the water system,” Robinson said via email. “We stand behind the integrity and competency of Mr. Puckett.” From 1992 to 1999, Puckett oversaw Flint’s Finance Department. He was at the helm in January of ’99 when that city forwarded $9 million to its pension system after failing to make transfers for about six months, according to the report that cites numerous articles published in the Flint Journal between 1999 and 2000. Puckett abruptly resigned days after news of the transfer broke, and he revealed in a letter to then 6th Ward City Councilman Mark Horrigan that “deposits — made up of employer and employee contributions — have not been transferred as they should have been for more than two years,” one Flint Journal article noted. Not long after, former Flint Treasurer Jim Goodwin told the Flint Journal the untransferred amount “was up to $21 million at one point.” At the time of his resignation, Puckett said he was considering a job offer received in December 1998. The CGA report claims that the failed transfers, which were supposed to have been moved every two weeks from a cash account to a money market retirement system account, cost Flint $1.1 million due to lost interest that the fund would have made. Puckett declined to comment on his time in Flint when the Daily Press contacted him in February; however, in the letter to Horrigan he stressed that “all monies in question ... have always been on deposit in the retirement fund,” the Flint Journal reported. He also said that “the money had simply not been transferred from one retirement fund to another.” Puckett blamed the failed transfers on an internal auditor in his department, but the Journal reported that a grievance chairman with the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees described that blame as “appalling” in a letter to then City Administrator David Ready. The letter said the employee blamed for failing to make the transfer "was never trained in this area because they are not authorized to do transfers to the pension fund," according to the Flint Journal. Prior to his resignation, Puckett did acknowledge he was to blame for failing to catch the employee’s error. In the weeks after Puckett’s resignation, the Flint Journal also reported on $6 million in misdirected property tax payments, as well as “millions of dollars in industrial facility taxes” that hadn’t been paid to the state of Michigan since 1996. Seven months after Puckett resigned, an audit “found significant deficiencies in the city’s internal controls over financial reporting,” the Flint Journal reported. Meanwhile, some 17 years on, Citizens for Government Accountability leadership believes Puckett’s actions can be linked to the water crisis in Flint that began in 2014 after that city changed its primary water source to the Flint River, a move that resulted in lead contamination and thrust the public health danger there into the national spotlight. “Puckett’s previous employer, Flint Mayor Woodrow Stanley, was recalled two years after Puckett’s resignation, largely because of the financial mess his administration had left the City in,” CGA leadership said in a statement. “The same year as Stanley’s recall, the Michigan State Government appointed an Emergency Manager for Flint, which ultimately led to a switch to the Flint River as a water source, lead-filled pipes, and ultimately the #FlintWaterCrisis.” The statement added, “It was actually under Puckett’s tenure as Finance Director that Flint water bills from its city-owned water utility soared, with some residents experiencing a ten-fold increase.” Robinson, however, praised Puckett's work, which includes helping to continue the town's 13-year streak of receiving the Distinguished Budget Presentation Award from the Government Finance Officers Association. "Under Mr. Puckett’s leadership, our financial stewardship has earned us accolades from national and international government accounting firms," Robinson said. "... We have exceeded the standards set by the California Society of Municipal Finance Officers, earning the Operating Budget Excellence Award for the first time in 2015, and again this year." CGA demanded answers in light of the report on Puckett, who has been in charge of Apple Valley’s finances since 2010. Diana Carloni, a former Hesperia mayor and member of CGA’s leadership committee, said Puckett’s “behavior in Flint shows a frightening pattern that is evident today in how he handles Apple Valley residents’ tax dollars.” “He demonstrates an utter lack of transparency,” Carloni said, “and crafts budgets that we have routinely called a ‘shell game’ for the way they obscure spending.” Matthew Cabe can be reached at MCabe@VVDailyPress.com or at 760-951-6254.

At the 5th Avenue Apple Store in New York, one of Apple's flagship locations, people have been waiting in line for days, saving spots with folding chairs and small one-person tents. Other stores in New York also have short lines at this time, based on photos sent in by MacRumors readers. Instagram image via Olaenglund At Apple's new San Francisco location, Apple Union Square, a handful of people are already waiting outside for an iPhone 7. People started lining up over the weekend. Instagram image via Minoyohan At the Summerlin Apple Store in Las Vegas, MacStadium's Brian Stucki set up a webcam to monitor the crowd situation. No one is waiting in line yet, but it should be a fun way to watch how activity progresses over the course of the rest of the week. Shipping estimates on some of the most popular Black and Jet Black iPhone 7 and 7 Plus models range into several weeks and last until November in some cases, so waiting in line on launch day is the only way to get one of the highly coveted devices if you missed out on pre-orders. The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus launch on Friday, September 16, and will debut first in Australia. It's Thursday morning in the country, so there's just a day to go until people start getting their hands on devices and sharing videos, pictures, and first impressions.

Troubleshoot iOS 10 Data Loss and Other Problems, with iMobie’s Tutorial Avoid iPhone 7 Upgrade Doom! Troubleshoot iOS 10 Data Loss and Other Problems, with iMobie’s Tutorial By Valerie Gotten - Sep 14, 2016 1:11 PM PST 1545 SHARE Facebook Twitter SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. /California Newswire/ — Although many users believe their Apple iPhones are 100 percent safe for iOS 10 update, thousands of iOS data disasters occur everyday and countless vital data are missing forever. To minimize the risk & cost of such miseries, iMobie content team prepared a full range of iPhone Data Recovery solutions (covering up to 12 categories of iOS data) for smoothing the way of iOS 10 / iPhone 7 Upgrade. Selena Larson at CNNTech reported that Apple users who were quick to download its latest iOS 10 software were subject to a major bug that left their iPhone temporarily useless. Whether users have met any iOS 10 problems or not, it’s noteworthy that by their nature, the iPhones may be in danger of missing data after updating to iOS 10, or setting up the new iPhone 7 (Plus) through restoring from iCloud backup. “Despite Apple has been through with a series of iOS 10 beta releases, the final version still produced problems for early downloaders today,” said Frank Kong, CEO of iMobie Inc. “To help users smooth the way of upgrading to iOS 10, as well as the upcoming iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus, our content team has been working on a definite and complete roundup to address a variety of iOS 10 data lost problems, like the iMessage audio attachments are missing after update to iOS 10, iCloud Photos Library doesn’t sync all my photos, to just name a few.” Read more details visit: https://www.imobie.com/support/ios-10-data-lost-issues-and-fixes.htm. Some Quick Fixes for iOS 10 Data Disaster: Recover Lost Messages – iCloud backup covers messages, like the iMessage, SMS, MMS and the pictures/videos attachments, which will be downloaded to iPhone during the restoration process. If users look for some message threads that are missing after restoring from iCloud backup, it’s probably caused by the mistakenly deletion before iPhone backed up to iCloud. Try the following commercial software to retrieve your deleted messages from iPhone. Recover Lost Contacts – The restoration of Calendar and Contact data from iCloud backup runs precisely and automatically, users even hardly notice how it occurs. In case the Calendar and Contact data are missing (probably it is due to the incomplete iCloud backup for the device), try this alternative iPhone Transfer solution to transfer Contact from your old iPhone to new iPhone.

Speculation about the timing of the Federal Reserve's next interest rate hike has shaken major stock indexes following contrasting comments from Fed officials. The S&P 500 remains down almost 3 percent from before a steep selloff on Friday, even though interest rate futures indicate expectations for a rate hike at the Fed's Sept. 20-21 meeting are still low. "What you're seeing is a little preview for what will happen when the Fed does raise rates," said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Cornerstone Financial Partners. "People are starting to make changes to their portfolios." Apple jumped 3.6 percent and briefly touched a 2016 high, with its market capitalization topping $600 billion for the first time since April, as Wall Street bet the technology company's newest iPhone would help shore up falling sales. Its rally helped push the S&P 500 technology index up 0.58 percent, making it the session's strongest sector. Oil prices dropped 2 percent following data that showed large weekly builds in U.S. petroleum products, sending the S&P energy index down 1.15 percent. Exxon Mobil declined 0.72 percent, the heaviest drag on the S&P 500. After spending much of the day with gains, the Dow Jones industrial average ended down 0.18 percent at 18,034.77 points and the S&P 500 gave up 0.06 percent to 2,125.77. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.36 percent to 5,173.77. Monsanto agreed to be bought by Bayer, but its stock rose just 0.62 percent to $106.76, well below the offer of $128 per share, due to concerns about regulatory approvals. Vitae Pharmaceuticals shares more than doubled to $20.85 after Allergan said it would buy the company for $639 million. Allergan rose 1.78 percent. Ford fell 1.94 percent after the automaker said 2017 financial performance would decline from this year's levels. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.11-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.03-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 1 new 52-week high and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 45 new highs and 41 new lows. About 7.0 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, above the 6.5 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data.

And just like the iPhone 7, the Apple Watch Series 2 looks nearly identical to its predecessor. So, what features will get you to upgrade from your original Apple Watch? The answer to that is a tough call as watchOS 3 gives the first-generation Watch a performance boost like no other. Some reviewers are focusing on the new operating system rather than its hardware. However, most reviews have one thing in common: Series 2 makes the Apple Watch a true fitness tracker. Adding GPS and being water resistant brings it much closer to other fitness devices. Though, the largest drawback is its one day battery life, while some say it’s the only worthwhile feature of the new hardware. Daring Fireball‘s John Gruber focuses on the combination of software (watchOS 3) and the hardware (Watch Series 2), and thinks the new ceramic Edition makes much more sense than the ridiculous gold one. WatchOS 3 fixes most of Apple Watch’s problems listed above. The Series 2 hardware fixes nearly all the rest (the off-by-default display will need at least one more leap in battery life and/or display technology). It is clear that Apple recognized what was wrong — not just the obvious issues like slowness, but the abstract ones like the user interface’s conceptual mushiness — and addressed them […] The screen brightness has doubled […] Battery life is better […] The built-in GPS works very well in my testing […] You can officially swim with it […] The new Edition model is made of gorgeous white ceramic. Priced starting at $1,250, it feels like Apple now has a handle on where Apple Watch fits in the luxury market. It also seems like they’re working with a material that could be relevant to other product lines. Mashable simply says the combination of software and hardware is “a match made in wearable heaven.” While little has changed in Apple Watch design, Series 2 and the latest software, called watchOS 3, do represent an important strategic shift. In particular, the new OS moves aside cutesy features like Digital Touch (that’s where you draw on the screen) and sharing your heartbeat in favor of more utility […] On the inside, though, is all-new hardware, including a brighter display, the S2 SiP (“System in Package”) which includes a new dual-core CPU and a new GPU, a larger battery and a special speaker system that plays sound and handles water […] The most exciting part of this multi-organ transplant is surely the new SiP. It makes the Apple Watch Series 2 faster and more responsive than the original Apple Watch in almost every way. PocketLint says the Series 2 is a “fitness first” device. The new watch features a much greater focus on fitness; it’s a device that tries to bridge the void between a basic fitness tracker, like products from Fitbit, and a full-blown dedicated sportswatch, such as those from Garmin […] With built-in GPS, a better battery (although it’s still very much one day per charge), water-resistance and a much greater focus on fitness, the Apple Watch finally works at workouts. That’s a massive gain over the first-generation device and one that is likely to appeal to those wanting more than a Fitbit, but who are scared by an all-powerful, athlete-focused watch from Garmin or Polar. However, for those who take their sport very seriously, we still can’t see the Watch 2 replacing a dedicated sportswatch just yet. It’s really for those looking for a do-it-all device that could easily go with a suit or some Lyrca. The Verge adds to the pile saying it’s all about fitness, while some of the drawbacks of the original Apple Watch still remains. Let’s call it what it is: a fitness tracker. The Apple Watch Series 2 is exactly that. It’s what Apple had resisted calling its wearable for the past year and a half, even declining to categorize it as such when citing industry rankings, opting for the “smartwatch” category instead. It is, definitely, still a smartwatch. But the Watch now has focus, and that’s a good thing […] I’ve noticed the display still doesn’t wake every time I raise or twist my wrist, which is annoying. And, even though the screen is now brighter and easily visible in normal daylight settings, it’s still tough to see in direct sunlight. At the end of the day this is a smartwatch with a retina OLED display, and not a reflective display like on other sport watches. It also doesn’t measure elevation when you’re recording an outdoor workout [and] it’s still a charge-every-day kind of thing if you work out, which is one of my least favorite aspects of smartwatches. Me personally, I don’t see myself upgrading from my original Watch. The only real selling point would be the improved speed on the Watch, though watchOS 3 for the most part fixes that.

Apple Community and the Vantiv Mobile Accelerator Program Cincinnati, OH (PRWEB) September 14, 2016 Vantiv, Inc. (NYSE: VNTV), a leading provider of payment processing services and related technology solutions for merchants and financial institutions of all sizes, today announced its support for Apple Pay on the web. Apple Pay will allow eCommerce websites to offer checkout in a single touch for customers shopping in Safari on iPhone, iPad and Mac. “For merchants, Apple Pay on the web is a game changer,” said Sayid Shabeer, vice president of merchant product at Vantiv. “By making it easier for customers to provide payment and shipping information to websites, eCommerce merchants have the opportunity to significantly reduce abandoned shopping carts and appeal to a larger customer base, which boosts top line sales.” Vantiv clients are already praising Apple Pay’s new capabilities, and how it will help their consumers. “We are continually looking for ways to use our payment technology to bring efficiencies to the online marketplaces and vertical markets we serve,” said Tom Villante, YapStone chairman and chief executive officer. “In partnering with Vantiv, we have the ability to use Apple Pay, an emerging and innovative technology that removes the friction of making and receiving payments. We are proud to partner with Vantiv, and our customer, HomeAway, to be among the first to offer Apple Pay on the web.” Along with its announcement of Apple Pay on the web, Vantiv also unveiled additional offerings related to Apple Pay including: The Vantiv Mobile Accelerator Program for Apple Pay – a fast-track program aimed at helping merchants and Independent Software Venders (ISVs) already processing with Vantiv to quickly adopt Apple Pay solutions. The Vantiv O.N.E. Apple Developer Community, part of TechTribe – a comprehensive set of technical and support resources that make it easier for developers to integrate Apple Pay in-app and web-based payments with various Vantiv payment platforms and technologies. TechTribe allows developers to help each other to accelerate mobile integrations. Apple Pay on the Web using Vantiv eProtect™ – an enhanced integration path for Apple Pay on the web that leverages Vantiv’s eProtect tokenization service to simplify integrations, help merchants reduce PCI scope and help simplify the development of OmniCommerce solutions. Membership to the Vantiv O.N.E. Apple Community is free and open to developers across the payments spectrum, including enterprise businesses, eCommerce, integrated payments, mobile, point-of-sale, and payment facilitators. “Every day more and more consumers are choosing to make eCommerce purchases from mobile phones and tablets,” said Tony Rose, who leads emerging product initiatives at Vantiv. “The Vantiv O.N.E. Apple Community aims to help software developers and merchants implement Apple Pay on the web and Apple Pay in-app more quickly and with less effort, so that merchants and customers alike can benefit from these important technologies.” Unlike some payment providers that offer only a single integration method for Apple Pay, Vantiv provides multiple solutions tailored to specific merchant requirements.

Evan Niu (TMFNewCow) Sep 14, 2016 at 2:32PM Image source: Apple. It's been about five years since Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) had any meaningful slot in Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone. Previously, Apple had sourced cellular baseband modems from its Infineon wireless segment, which Intel acquired way back in 2010. But then Apple dropped Infineon and began exclusively sourcing baseband from Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) starting with the iPhone 4s in 2011, and has stuck with the mobile chip giant ever since. Intel has fought for years to get back in, and rumors to that effect have swirled ahead of every iPhone launch. Well, it looks like Chipzilla has finally succeeded. Tech teardown Investors won't know for sure until the new iPhones are shipped and subsequently torn down to see what components are inside. This usually occurs immediately within a day or two. But all signs point to Intel having won the GSM-equipped variants. Unlike in recent years where a single Qualcomm modem could handle just about any network you threw at it, you'll notice that this year half of the models do not support CDMA networks. Intel's 7630 modem fits the bill. From a global perspective, GSM is generally far more widely used for 3G connectivity. But CDMA is important in the two largest smartphone markets: U.S. and China. Half of the domestic carriers use CDMA, while TD-SCDMA is prevalent in China, so Intel's win will be limited. That also has some potential implications for global travelers that need broader support. Not only do the specs suggest that Apple is now dual-sourcing from Intel, but The Wall Street Journal's people ever familiar with the matter have also confirmed it. Intel has undoubtedly failed in the mobile market, but this win is a small consolation. I'd also be worried about the negative implications for Qualcomm. Apple is one of Qualcomm's two most important customers, and Apple has undoubtedly been using this dual-sourcing strategy as negotiating leverage. To the extent that Intel can continue catching up with its baseband products, Apple will continue putting the squeeze on Qualcomm for volume concessions. In less than a week, we'll know for sure whether or not there's Intel inside, but all signs point to yes. Evan Niu, CFA owns shares of Apple.

(Gary Reyes/Bay Area News Group/TNS) Apple Watch Series 2 are on display during the product launch of the iPhone 7 at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco on Wednesday, Sept. 7, 2016. (Gary Reyes/Bay Area News Group/TNS) Two years ago, Apple Inc. executives made the case that anyone with an iPhone would be better off also owning the company’s new smartwatch. But as many gadget buyers remain unsure about the usefulness of high-tech timepieces, Apple this week pitched its second-edition watch to a much narrower audience. Workout and activity tracking capabilities surged to the front and center, taking over the spotlight from messaging features and customizable timefaces. The promotional video for the Watch Series 2 featured almost only athletes: swimmers, tennis and basketball players, cyclists, skateboarders and runners. The shift in approach reflects some major technical changes. The Apple Watch Series 2 has built-in GPS – essential to athletes who don’t want to lug their phones on runs or bike rides – and is water resistant for use while swimming and surfing. But establishing the Watch as a fitness tracker rather than a catch-all smartwatch serves a bigger purpose too, analysts said. Thanks to smartphones and popular devices such as the Fitbit, consumers now understand how devices can track steps and monitor sleep. Emphasizing those features make the Watch a more familiar device than the revolutionary communications tool Apple touted in 2014. The “ultimate device for a healthy life” is how Apple Senior Vice President Jeff Williams summed up the Watch at a media event Wednesday. Two years ago, Apple called the Watch its “most personal device ever.” Apple showcased games, animated messages and other features on stage this week as well, but health and fitness underlined even some of those presentations. “You get people into the Watch through the guise of fitness, but then you get people messaging and playing games,” said Jitesh Ubrani, research analyst at the data firm IDC. Though Apple hasn’t released sales figures, analysts estimates upward of 12 million Watches have been sold since the original incarnation went on sale in April 2015. Some experts say the device suffered from an identity crisis. The device’s benefits weren’t clear and immediate for most. “Personality disorder is what I would like to call it,” venture capitalist and Fitbit investor Om Malik told Bloomberg TV on Wednesday. “Until they figure that out, Fitbit has a clear lead and will maintain a clear lead.” Sharpening the pitch for the Watch suggests Apple may be on its way to reining in aggressive ambitions and figuring out a clearer, albeit smaller, role for the device. Apple did not respond to a request for comment. “There’s absolutely a refocus toward fitness,” Ubrani said. “It’s the low-hanging fruit.” A faster version of the Apple Watch Series 1 will go on sale next Friday for $269, or about $80 less than the retail price at launch last year. The Watch Series 2 starts at $369, including a set of wristpieces with unique colors and features designed in collaboration with Nike. Sports-centric marketing campaigns around the Watch could spur more interest in offerings from Fitbit, Jawbone and other fitness tracker makers. Their wearables generally cost less and have longer-lasting batteries than Apple Watch. Their limited apps haven’t turned off consumers, who are satisfied with just having smartphone notifications pushed to their wrist, said Ray Maker, who runs the popular fitness-device blog DCMaker. The competitors also work in tandem with Android smartphones; the Apple Watch only syncs data with iPhones. And data suggest Apple’s rivals have plenty of room to grow as a result. Only about 25 percent of people who purchased a Fitbit online since the start of 2014 also bought an iPhone over the Internet, according to data from receipt tracker Slice Intelligence. Running and cycling watch companies such as Garmin sell well among endurance sports enthusiasts, but they may lose sales to Apple if consumers find the Watch Series 2 more multi-functional, fashionable and fairly priced. Some may continue to opt against the Apple Watch because other options are better tailored for harsh-weather and rugged environments, Maker said. Another big problem for many athletes is the battery. The five-hour GPS battery life on the Watch won’t hold up for some marathon runners or any Ironman competitors. “If you’re training for a marathon or a triathlon, it’s likely you’re going to want something that you know will get you to the finish line,” Maker said. The Apple Watch battery life is “well below virtually all fitness companies’ GPS watches today on the market.” About 25 percent of wearable devices sold last quarter were Fitbits, with models from Xiaomi, Apple and Garmin following in the low teens and single digits. Fitbit’s dominance is expected to continue through the holiday season in large part because demand has been for affordable, lower-tech fitness trackers, analysts said. In other words, for all the robust capabilities of Apple Watch, it might be the simple things that get consumers to consider it. “It will be a slow transition from basic wearables to smart wearables,” IDC research manager Ramon Llamas said.

The device quickly became the best-selling smartwatch of all time, toppling almost all traditional watchmakers in 2015. Last year, Apple became the second highest-selling watchmaker, coming second only to Rolex. Related: WatchOS 3 breathes new life into the Apple Watch… quite literally Now that the Apple Watch 2 is available for purchase, there are many options to choose from when you take the different models, finishes, and bands into account. Luckily for you, we’ve put together this guide to buying an Apple Watch. We’ll talk about the actual models first, followed by the finishes and bands. Apple Watch models As far as the technology goes, there are two main versions of the Apple Watch — the Apple Watch Series 1 and the Apple Watch Series 2. Here’s a quick spec comparison of the two devices. Apple Watch Series 1 Apple Watch Series 2 Processor S1P S2 Operating System watchOS3 watchOS3 Body (Dimensions) 1.65 x 1.41 x 0.41 inch 1.65 x 1.41 x 0.41 inch Resolution (pixels) 272 x 340 390 x 312 272 x 340 390 x 312 Weight 50 grams 70 grams CPU 520 MHz Dual Core Screen Sapphire crystal glass Ion-X strengthened glass (aluminum cases) Sapphire crystal glass (stainless steel and ceramic cases) GPS Enabled No Yes Waterproof Splash resistant only Waterproof up to 50 meters Available Ceramic Casing No Yes Display OLED Retina display with Force Touch (450 nits) Second-generation OLED Retina display with Force Touch (1,000 nits) As you can see, there aren’t that many differences between the two devices, but the changes are key. For example, the Apple Watch Series 2 adds features such as GPS and waterproofing for up to 50 meters. What does that mean for you if you’re buying a new Apple Watch? If you’re someone that tends to run or walk a lot and you don’t want to carry your phone around for GPS all the time, then you’re probably going to want to buy the Series 2. The same goes for those who swim or do a lot of water sports and want the Apple Watch to track those activities. If, however, you don’t think you’ll need waterproofing and don’t care about GPS, perhaps save a little cash and stick to the Series 1 Apple Watch. Related: Apple’s waterproof Watch Series 2 also gets faster, brighter, and has GPS Once you’ve chosen the device you want to go with, you’re going to want to choose a size — either 38- or 42-millimeter. Most talk about the sizes as ‘men’s’ or ‘women’s’ sizes, but in reality, their targeted at those with large wrists and those with small wrists. In other words, if you’re a man with a particularly small wrist, you may want to think about going with the smaller device instead. Likewise, if you’re a woman with a wrist that’s larger than average, you might be better suited with the larger Apple Watch. If you’re somewhere in between, hit the Apple Store and try on a few devices to see which size is more comfortable. You’ll probably notice that when you go to the Apple Watch website, you have more options than simply ‘Series 1’ or ‘Series 2.’ There’s more to each model than the technology under the hood, after all, and the array of finishes and bands allow you to customize the look and feel of your Apple Watch to your liking.

As more and more Messages App Store apps have rolled out, Apple has updated the App Store to include a new Categories feature, improving discovery. Located at the top of the Messages App Store between "Featured" and "Manage," the new Category section breaks down apps into different groups, including Entertainment, Food & Drink, Games, Lifestyle, Photo & Video, Productivity, Shopping, Social Networking, Stickers, and Travel. Each section includes a selection of apps chosen by Apple as "Our Favorites," along with a "More to Explore" option. As the Messages App Store grows, these categories will likely fill out and gain new sections. In the Stickers category, there's a further breakdown to make it easier to sort through the myriad stickers in the Messages App Store. Sticker categories include Animals & Nature, Comics & Cartoons, Eating & Drinking, Emoji & Expressions, Fashion, Gaming, Kids & Family, and Places & Objects. Though the Messages App Store has only been available for a day, it's already flush with apps. We've rounded up some of the best sticker packs we've come across and some of the must-have time-saving apps that genuinely improve the Messages experience.

I disagree. When you throw in a bunch of unneeded features -- especially ones that are visually distracting -- it takes away from simplicity and ease of use. There's so many visual cues on screen it's difficult to know, intuitively, what to press to find what you want. The text bar has been reduced, the send button is smaller, etc. etc. These are all minor gripes, but they add up and detract from the overall user experience. None of this will matter to those who regularly use Facebook chat and the like, but for everyone else, it's the exact opposite of "magical". Rating: 1 Votes pcmacgamer 9 weeks ago I disagree.

The size of the text bar and button don't take away anything from what the app does. UI changes happen all the time in all of their apps. Seems silly to speak in absolutes saying everyone else will be bothered. I never use the Facebook type messengers and have gotten a bit of a kick out of all these fun apps.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « ABC Interview Videos with Apple's CEO on Augmented Reality, AirPods & More | Main | Indian Rumor: Apple pulling back Development Work In-House from Infosys and Cognizant » September 14, 2016 Could Apple Tap into the Enterprise Wearable Ring Scanner Market?   Close to a year ago Patently Apple posted a patent report covering a newly invented wearable device in the form of a smart-ring. The patent application provided us with a grande overview of the possible applications and features associated with a smart-ring. Apple described the new device as being able to incorporate touch-sensitive surfaces, gesture sensors, voice recognition, a camera, a microphone and more. The Apple ring could one day be used with a smart TV, open an office/home or vehicle door, act as cursor for your MacBook, provide biometric readings and act as a scanner. Which brings us to the topic of the day. According to a new ABI Research report, wearable scanners could be a big niche market boosting business efficiency. Considering that Apple's iOS devices are used by nearly every Fortune 500 and Global 500 company, the Apple ring accessory may be able to assist companies take inventory quickly and much more.   Wearable Scanners, Scanner Rings   ABI Research notes that "While consumers may immediately think of fitness trackers when they picture wearables, the devices are quickly migrating out of the gym and into the office, with the wearable scanner market experiencing rapid expansion.   ABI Research forecasts enterprise wearable scanner shipments will reach nearly 22 million by 2021, increasing from just seven million in 2016.   Stephanie Lawrence, Research Analyst at ABI Research notes in the report that "Wearable scanners boost business productivity, offering workers a faster, hands-free alternative to the need for traditional hand-held scanners and paper picklists. Ring barcode scanners, glove scanners, and smartglasses are the most popular forms, which, depending on the device type, allow their wearers to scan barcodes, record processes, and access information without interruption."   Wearable ring scanners, such as those from Honeywell and Zebra, rely on a ring barcode scanner that connects to a wearable computer and allow the user to access and update information about the scanned product."   As shown below, the Honeywell finger scanner is a super clunky combination device. Compare that to using an Apple smart-ring wirelessly working with an iPhone and you could easily see how the Apple ring could find a new niche to tap into.   In fact, if you look at the Apple patent figure shown in our cover graphic, the position and angle of the ring face is positioned in a scanner like manner. I always thought that it was a strange placement for a ring below the knuckle, but not if it's able to be used as a scanner as is the focus of the ABI research report.      The ABI report further noted that "Glove scanners, from manufacturers like ProGlove, provide a tracking interface for wearers to record manufacturing procedures for better quality control. Similarly, smartglasses, such as Vuzix M100 and M300, ultimately offer guided workflows, allowing the wearer to receive assistance and new instructions when required.   As the devices begin to break ground across a wider variety of enterprises, ABI Research predicts more companies, including Amazon, Boeing, DHL, FedEx, IBM, UPS, and View Technologies, will invest in them. The warehousing, manufacturing, and transportation industries will see the largest adoption of wearable scanners for 2016 to 2021.   During this period, most of these companies will use the wearable scanners to scan barcodes on packages when they are picked, packed, and moved. In the long term, ABI Research expects these devices to improve efficiency and streamline workflow processes.   Ryan Martin, Senior Analyst at ABI Research concludes that "Enterprise wearable scanner and reader technologies provide the ability to achieve faster throughput with greater accuracy and minimal re-work using only entry-level applications."   While Apple will likely focus on consumer applications for a possible future smart-ring, the fact is that Apple has made gigantic leaps into the enterprise market in recent years by partnering with IBM on MobileFirst, Cisco and SAP.   In the future we may see Apple Pencil work with an iPhone pro model and we may also see an Apple smart-ring work in industries that rely on efficient scanners. It may not be something that Apple necessarily focuses on but could assist their developers tap into another growing market niche. Either way, a future Apple smart-ring could be a viable new wearable device to keep our eye on.   One More Thing about Apple Wearbles   And one more thing regarding Apple wearables. Apple was noted in a new IDC China Wearable Device Market report published this week. Apple was the only foreign company to place on the top five vendors list. Of course once the Apple Watch series 2 comes to China, we're bound to see a nice bounce for Apple over the holiday quarter. Then again, with cheap $25 dollar wearables included in IDC's statistics, Apple won't be able to top that list as Apple doesn't participate in close-to profitless market segments that Xiaomi enjoys to bask in.     About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

TechRadar The source for Tech Buying Advice Search RSS Reviews How To Phones TVs Laptops Deals Photography More Car Tech Wearables Tablets Components Audiovisual Gaming Computing Downloads News Pro Trending MacBook Pro Nintendo Switch Google Pixel iOS 10.1 PS4 Pro Early Black Friday Deals News Here's another hint Apple is working on AR Here's another hint Apple is working on AR By Lewis Leong Apple   Tim Cook says AR > VR Shares Apple is usually pretty secretive about its upcoming products, but that isn't stopping CEO Tim Cook from dropping hints about the company's next big thing. Earlier today, Cook was asked for his thoughts about virtual reality storytelling in an interview with Good Morning America. "There's virtual reality and then there's augmented reality," Cook replied. "Both of these are incredibly interesting, but my own view is that augmented reality is the larger of the two, probably by far. "[Augmented reality] gives us the capability for both of us to sit and be very present, talking to each other, but also have something visually for both of us to see." This isn't the first time Cook has spoken about augmented reality and virtual reality, or AR and VR. In August, he revealed that Apple is doing a "lot of things" with augmented reality. This revelation came weeks after he confirmed the company was investing in the tech. Cook wasn't completely dismissive of VR today, though. "Virtually reality closes and immerses the person into an experience that can be really cool but probably has a lower commercial interest," he said. "But there's some very cool areas for education and gaming that we have a lot of interest in." Doubling down on AR Cook has been on a bit of a AR-hint dropping tear this year, revealing on Apple's last earnings call the company is very much interested in the mixed-reality tech. "We are high on AR for the long run," Cook said in July. "We think there's great things for customers and a great commercial opportunity. So we're investing." Cook cited the massive success of Pokémon Go as "incredible," bringing the use of AR into the mainstream. The mobile game has exceeded more than half a billion downloads, and Apple gave its developer, Niantic, center stage during its iPhone 7 launch event to show off the game running on the Apple Watch. The mobile game will eventually come to Google's Android Wear smartwatch platform as well. Apple reportedly put together a team of experts to work on its augmented and virtual reality initiatives, according to a Financial Times from the beginning of this year. This news broke after Apple confirmed is acquisition of Flyby Media, a startup that helped Google develop is Project Tango 3D-mapping technology. Despite all the smoke, it's unclear what product Apple will actually create that will incorporate augmented reality. Will it make a headset, like the Microsoft Hololens? Or, perhaps Apple will create an AR experience that won't require a headset at all. Many would argue Apple has been in a rut lately, only offering incremental updates to its products, like the iPhone 7 and Apple Watch Series 2. With AR on the horizon, Apple may finally wow us again with "one more thing." How augmented reality will change the world as we know it Tags iPhone Related news Almost over!

If you have an iPhone 6s or later, there are a wide range of 3D Touch gestures that you can test out in iOS 10, particularly from the home screen. Here we've compiled a list of native app icons that now support 3D Touch, as well as a handful of other useful functions. Some of them will be more relevant to you than others, depending on your usage habits. You can find additional 3D Touch shortcuts for the Control Center and Widgets Panel in iOS 10 in our respective how-to guides. Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel for more videos. Settings Icon Some of the most handy 3D Touch functions can be found by hard-pressing the Settings app icon, which allows you to access the Bluetooth and Wi-Fi screens to quickly connect to a wireless device or hotspot. News and Weather Icons Deep-pressing Apple's News app offers you a preview of the current headline, which you can tap to go to directly, as well as shortcuts to the personalized For You section and any other custom news sources you've selected. The Weather app also has a new preview widget for accessing from the home screen, with options to launch the app straight into a specific location forecast. Note how app icon 3D Touch previews have an 'Add Widget' option in the top-right that let you add them to your Widgets panel (if they're not already there). The Widgets panel can be accessed by swiping right on the home screen and the lock screen. Calendar and Reminders Apps The Calendar and Reminders app icons have 3D Touch options to add events or to add reminders to specific lists. In addition, if a calendar notification banner appears at the top of your screen, you can deep press it for more options. An event can then be snoozed, while an invitation can be accepted or declined without entering the full app. Similarly, a reminder notification banner can be deep pressed, where you can mark the reminder as completed, or opt to be reminded about it later. Photos and Camera Icons The Photos app icon offers yearly photo collection shortcuts, along with options to see the most recent shot taken, your designated favorites, and a quick search option. Meanwhile, the Camera app gives you shortcuts to take a photo, record video, and take a selfie with the front-facing camera. Mail and Messages Icons Hard pressing on the Mail app icon gets you shortcuts to your inbox, favorites, the search field, and the composition screen, while pressing down on the Messages icon brings up shortcuts to compose a new message and any recent message threads. And don't forget, hard pressing on an incoming iMessage notification banner lets you reply to it without entering the app. Phone, Contacts, and FaceTime A harder press on the Phone app gets you a pop-up menu with options to call one of your designated favorites, create a new contact or search for an existing one, and view the most recent call. The first two shortcuts are mirrored by a deep press on the Contacts app, which in addition offers to take you straight to your own info card. The FaceTime app icon also offers 3D Touch shortcuts to your Favorites. Safari and Apple Maps Icons Quick Safari shortcuts include opening a new (private) tab and going straight to your Reading List or Bookmarks, while the Maps app icon gives you a destination preview and the ability send and mark your location or search nearby. Folders and Downloads If you've got a few apps downloading or updating at the same time, a hard press on one of them gives you the option to prioritize its download over all others. Note the Share option shown here, too - this appears as a default option for any third-party app icon you hard press. 3D Touch works on folders too: hard pressing gives you the option to rename the folder, and if there are any apps contained therein sporting notification badges, you get a shortcut to these as well. iCloud and Music Hard pressing the iCloud icon brings up shortcuts to three recently accessed files and a handy search function. The same action applied to the Music icon displays a search option, a shortcut to Beats 1 radio, and a widget with your three most frequently played albums plus a shuffle option - tap any of them to start playing without entering the app. Other Native App Shortcuts In iOS 10, other apps that offer useful shortcuts via 3D Touch include the Compass, Stocks, Podcasts, Tips, Clock, Wallet, Apple Store, App Store, and iTunes Store. And be sure to check out which of your third-party app icons have integrated 3D Touch, too. Other 3D Touch Tricks Peek and Pop Two other 3D Touch features worth playing around with are 'Peek' and 'Pop'. Essentially they function as content preview functions – letting you, say, look (or peek) at the contents of an email without actually opening it, simply by hard pressing on the message in your inbox. A firmer press makes the same email open fully, while a swipe up reveals options for replying, forwarding, and the like. Peek and Pop also let you view content from other apps without opening them. For example, instead of tapping on the address in the above email which would switch us to the Maps app, a hard press pops up a more convenient preview of the map. Immediately swiping up on the preview likewise reveals a series of further options, while tapping on the preview opens up the Maps app proper. The same principle applies to web links and attachments in emails. In fact, this action can be found throughout iOS 10, so it's worth experimenting whenever you come across linked content that would usually require you to switch apps. App Switcher and Cursor Control Next time you want to open a recent app you used, try hard pressing the left side of the screen. The App Switcher should be activated, and the harder you press, the more recently-opened apps you'll see. This action works from the home screen, as well as a number of other native apps. Lastly, next time you're using the onscreen keyboard, hard press on a letter and you'll gain control of the cursor, enabling you to easily track back and edit your text. Keep on Pressing More and more third-party apps are integrating 3D Touch in useful ways, so don't be shy – press away when you think it might lead to an action. And remember, if you're having trouble with the sensitivity of 3D Touch, you can adjust it in Settings -> General -> Accessibility -> 3D Touch.

That isn't so easy to do without eating up battery and won't be very user friendly. [doublepost=1473886400][/doublepost] Aren't these 3D touch functions just an indication that the app has become bloated to the point that the simple core functions can not be found easily on launch? How so? They are just shortcuts to jump to something within the app. Instead of opening the phone app and then selecting who I would like to call, I just force touch and select from my favorites.

A machine that still ships,” Anthony Frausto-Robledo writes for Architosh. “So Mac users need to get used to one obvious fact — something different is coming our way and we hope, and we hope, it returns back to the basics we crave.” “With no announcement in Q1 and no hardware at all at this year’s WWDC, it is clear that one of two things is going to happen: [1] Apple will quietly exit the professional computer markets such as film and broadcast, architecture and engineering, 3d animation and special effects, photography and graphics, science and medicine, and audio and music production, et cetera, or [2] Apple will re-introduce a new type of professional Mac in a brand new architecture,” Frausto-Robledo writes. “We are crossing our fingers and praying that Apple doesn’t choose the first option.” Apple’s Mac Pro   “Apple needs to stop making signature, iconic machines aimed more for the Smithsonian Institute than for actual production uses and start learning their core pro markets and tailor the next pro desktop design to around those needs,” Frausto-Robledo writes. “Let’s hope no hardware at WWDC 2016 portends to something really great come this fall.” Read more in the full article here.

We’re too small a market to cater to anymore. That’s NOT to say that Apple will never make anything more than caters to pros, but it has been extremely obvious that the Mac Pro didn’t sell well, and that Apple has focused more on pro software, and that the pro-user market not served by the 27-inch 5K iMac is now a fairly tiny market that’s never going to be profitable enough for Apple to make a top priority. I think with Thunderbolt 3/USB-C now finally fully out, we may get one more Mac Pro (same design as current), or some other pro-aimed hardware, but that’s probably about it. Apple leaving the server market was the smartest thing it ever did in Enterprise — look at where it is now in that sector! — and it gave us the 5K iMac, which is a fabulous machine. The Mac Pro may not be dead, but its coughing up blood, to quote a line from Monty Python. joe Friday, June 17, 2016 - 2:29 pm · Reply “the pro-user market not served by the 27-inch 5K iMac is now a fairly tiny market” is probably the key issue. Apple packs in a lot of performance and features at a very appealing price point for most people. Still curious why they wouldn’t at least bump the Mac Pro ports, cpu, and graphics over time. Mike Friday, June 17, 2016 - 2:44 pm · Reply By the same logic, then Bugatti, McLaren, Lamborghini, Ferrari, etc should stop making supercars because the market is too small. We hear over and over again here at MDN that market share doesn’t matter, only profitability. Well, every time anyone speaks of professionals, the internet lights up with people asking when Apple is going to get off its ass and deliver the hardware that people want. Clearly there is a market, and these people have money. What is missing is Apple leadership. Cook and company think that the future is thin client computing. He is dead wrong, and if he continues thumbing his nose at creative professionals, then they will abandon Apple altogether. There will be no reason to get an Apple TV or other consumer gadget when the real work BY NECESSITY needs to be done on a Wintel box. So no iCloud, and definitely no need for Apple TV or Apple Music. All the competing media services are platform agnostic, so why bother dealing with Apple’s limitations? As professional users go, eventually so does the rest of Apple’s products. Cook doesn’t understand this. He thinks iCloud is the center of the world, and all things Apple must be connected to it at all times. jltnol Friday, June 17, 2016 - 8:44 pm · Reply “…We hear over and over again here at MDN that market share doesn’t matter, only profitability…” And to some extent they are right… however, Apple has focused their resources on content consumers, and indeed, do their best to provide said content. But how that content is CREATED ? Apple is clearly loosing interest very, very, VERY fast. Photo Pro Friday, June 17, 2016 - 2:46 pm · Reply Some pros appear to be suffering from classic Stockholm Syndrome. Apple has already exited the pro market guys. In photography specifically they did it 2 years ago by letting Aperture die on the vine, and did not think it was worth actually informing professional customers of their decision. They happened to mention it in passing to Macworld’s Jason Snell. At the time we (and by ‘we’ I mean those that had not already moved on) were all posting stupidly optimistic “here’s my wish list for Aperture X” comments in forums while Lightroom disappeared into the distance. Fools we were. As soon as I got the news I put a halt to all new Apple gear purchases at my company. Thing is, they had already given video pros a giant middle finger in 2011 with the FCPX debacle. We should have seen it coming. I sincerely hope Apple people are reading this. If you think that little of me as a customer why the **** should I support you? M Friday, June 17, 2016 - 3:03 pm · Reply Apple should team up with Other World Computing and let OWC build custom Macs. They are already great at squeezing every ounce of power with custom builds..and they follow Apples design scheme on their house built peripherals.

John Gee Friday, June 17, 2016 - 4:14 pm · Reply I am 90% sure I was first to call it a trashcan. I can’t say how, or to whom, but I am honored. By myself, yes. But honored😉 C++ Friday, June 17, 2016 - 5:36 pm · Reply “Can’t innovate my ass…”🙂 Angry Pro Friday, June 17, 2016 - 8:04 pm · Reply No, Phil was right, it was innovative, and for a select few, it’s perfect. But, and it’s a big but, it is only a few. Apple has been misreading the pro market now for nigh on a damn decade. Key to Apple’s failure is in understanding that while they demand road maps and consistency from their suppliers, they’re not willing to give any of the same to their pro customers. I’m a pro, I have money to spend on this stuff. Apple is getting none of it. Derek Currie Saturday, June 18, 2016 - 2:56 pm · Reply And then they forgot about it.

Derek Currie Saturday, June 18, 2016 - 2:55 pm · Reply Apple just missed the perfect opportunity to update the two year-old new Mac Pro. NO. This was WWDC week, a Developer’s Conference. DUH. Check back later this summer to find out if Apple still cares about anything called ‘Mac Pro’. – – I have to agree that so far all indications are not. But there is no RIP yet. Starkoman Friday, September 9, 2016 - 4:40 pm · Reply This is depressing. Pro businesses and users can’t keep chugging along with maxed-out Mid-2012 Mac Pro’s — it’s ridiculous. 750,000 ‘trashcans’ sold, clearly made a nice ROI for Apple, yet that number excludes the Pro market who couldn’t justify them in 2013 lacking future-proof expandability. Frankly, my company — and others we work with — are sick and tired of waiting for Apple to stun us with something proper. We’ve built two experimental custom machines running Hackintosh and, so far, they’re fast and stable but neither are an ideal solution because they need tricking to set up, are very component sensitive and take up far too much admin time. We’ve ramped up every bit of the network and storage during the wait to squeeze the best out of everything we’ve got but the production machines are becoming the final bottleneck now. I hate to say it but, if Apple don’t pull their finger out soon, the competition are going to get the trade and we’ll end up on Windows 10 with Linux servers — it’s the only upgrade path left, sadly — plus the thought of learning Linux or Win2012 servers gives me The Fear. Some promise or reassurance from Apple right now would be a big relief from the uncertainty, because their apparent lack of interest in the Pro market — like their shocking exit from the Server market — is a serious worry and a business headache. We need to move on and make plans and Apples’ non-activity in this area is the stumbling block. SunbeamRapier Wednesday, September 14, 2016 - 3:32 pm · Reply No-one at Apple seems to do any work on their Macs. Witness the removal of key functionality from Pages and the woeful charts in Numbers. Ive obviously never had the Mac Pro tested in a real environment or he would have seen the clutter it creates with cables and bits everywhere. My thunderbolt 2 connections are unreliable also, and I lose a huge amount of desk space when my lto6 tape drive and 4-drive raid array are connected, along with a card reader (dangling from a port) and portable usb drives plus cd reader. A big tower under the desk would be fabulous.

Submit + Newsletter Honey I fixed the Airpods By Sarang Sheth 09/14/2016 You know, you’d expect Apple of all companies to design something with foresight. The Airpods became a meme on the internet for being by far the most functionally inferior products to leave the Apple headquarters. Headphones without wires? It didn’t take the smartest of us to think, what if they fell off? Even one of the Airpods going missing would render the $150 product useless. Spigen came to the rescue with their $10 Airpod tethers and the internet laughed a little more… but here I am, with by far the most simple and ingenious solution to your Airpod woes. Designed by Ben Ingignieri, the Airpod Securers are the facepalmingly obvious solution we all were looking for. If your headphones are wireless, at least secure them around you ear, right?

Fueled by U.S. wireless carriers' reports of strong early orders for the iPhone 7 as well as arch-rival Samsung Electronics' widely-publicized recall of potentially exploding Galaxy Note 7 smartphones, shares of Apple rose as much as 4.7 percent to $113.03 for a gain of 10 percent in the past three days. Its market capitalization reached nearly $607 billion, compared to $535 billion for Alphabet and $440 billion for Microsoft. After sinking to a two-year low in July that had portfolio managers describing Apple as a value stock and no longer a growth play, shares of the world's most valuable listed company have since rebounded 25 percent. On Tuesday, Sprint said pre-orders for the iPhone 7 were up nearly four times compared to last year's iPhone. T-Mobile said pre-orders rose nearly four times compared with its next most popular iPhone. Potentially adding to demand for Apple's products, China's quality watchdog said on Wednesday that Samsung would recall 1,858 of its Galaxy Note 7 phones due to its fire-prone batteries, expanding the list of countries where the devices have been recalled. "With the carriers telling Samsung owners that Samsung wants you to take your phone back into the store, well, people are going to look elsewhere," said Longbow Research analyst Shawn Harrison. Specific details about sales of the new iPhone are scarce after Apple announced last week it would not release weekend sales data, saying the number was more a reflection of supply than demand. Also up on Wednesday were companies supplying chips and other technology for iPhones: Cirrus Logic rallied 4.3 percent, Skyworks Solutions gained 3.8 percent and Jabil Circuit added 2.8 percent. With U.S. consumers less eager than in the past to replace their devices, global smartphone shipments are likely to grow less than 2 percent in 2016, compared to 10 percent last year, according to market research firm IDC. Revenue for Apple's fiscal year ending this month is likely to fall 8 percent and then grow 4 percent next year, according to the average estimate of analysts tracked by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

In blind taste tests conducted here and in Illinois last year by the Michigan Apple Committee last fall, Michigan Honeycrisp apples beat out both other apple varieties, and Honeycrisps grown in other states. By 2014, the most recent year data is available, more than 1.5 million Honeycrisp apple trees had been planted to meet that strong demand, according to the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service. "Demand hasn't hasn't slowed down, it wasn't a fad," said Crane, who planted his Fennville orchard's first block of Honeycrisp apples back in 1992. "It will always be good." Honeycrisp apples are ready for picking at Crane Orchards The first few years, Crane's young trees only produced enough fruit to allow customers a sample. When trees in Crane's orchard matured, his supply of Honeycrisps would sell out within an hour or two, he said. He kept planting more trees and the demand kept growing. The 2016 crop is the "biggest crop we've ever had," Crane said, not just in his orchard but for growers across the state. Guide to 2016 Apple harvest Apple peeling hack too good to be true? Not only have the temperature and moisture been right to make lots of big, sweet apples grow, but the cold front moved through just in the nick of time to put people in the mood to pick them, he said. Looking out over the orchard, the blue sky dotted with clouds, Crane called it a "perfect storm," of optimum conditions to assure families turning out for opening day a beautiful fall experience. Sometimes that's as important as the product, he said. Crane was packing cars in Wednesday morning, Sept. 14. Steve and Cindy Lawson drove down from Holland to pick, bringing their adult daughter, Erica Balster, who lives in Cleveland. "Their apples are good and their price is good," Steve Lawson said. And when Crane talks about families that make the trek an annual tradition, "we are one of those families, " Cindy Lawson said with a laugh. Rhonda Sparger met up with Jennifer Wolfe and other friends, all of Indiana, to eat breakfast at Crane's Pie Pantry just east of the orchard before picking their fill. The women said they decided to make an outing of Honeycrisp opening day after Rhonda raved about the experience. Joe Stapel of Muskegon and Doug Kirk of Holland have been picking Honeycrisps at the orchard every year for years after Stapel introduced Kirk to the variety. "They're juicy and sweet," Stapel said. "Just try one-- I find they are the best", he said. For years Wendy and Chuck Ralis made the opening day drive every year from Chicago, but now they live in Grand Junction, are retired, and they pick for the rest of the family, Chuck Ralis said. They expect to pick about 50 pounds, and will store them over the winter for use all year, Wendy said. She said orchard workers advised her to store the apples in cool, dark place for a few days before moving them into the refrigerator, and she found the apples stayed fresh until they ran out in the spring.

The latest version of Apple’s mobile device operating system, released Tuesday, is supposed to offer more intuitive, useful features than ever before but hundreds of Twitter users didn’t even get far enough to try them out — their phones were bricked, or rendered unusable, in the process of trying to install iOS 10. In a brief emailed statement, Apple acknowledged it “experienced a brief issue with the software update process” during the first hour of iOS 10’s availability that affected a “small number” of users. “The problem was quickly resolved and we apologize to those customers,” the statement said. “Anyone who was affected should connect to iTunes to complete the update or contact AppleCare for help.” The tech giant has also released a step-by-step guide on what to do if users can’t update or restore their mobile devices. Article Continued Below Other complaints included the elimination of the swipe-to-unlock feature and replacing the pistol emoji with one of a water gun. The update was released days before the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus go on sale, which stirred up their own ruckus after Apple announced the phones would not have the traditional 3.5mm headphone jack found on most devices. Instead, users will have to use an adaptor to plug in their headphones. This isn’t the first time a software update has been a little less than smooth for Apple — a rush of people trying to download iOS 5 back in 2011 overwhelmed Apple’s servers and caused some downloads to stop midway, bricking devices caught in the middle of an update.

The nearly 2 GB update is available via Settings > General > Software Update or through iTunes. See “iOS 10 Promises New Lock Screen, Open Siri, and More” (13 June 2016) for an overview of the major new features. There was an initial issue that caused the over-the-air update to brick iOS devices, which is now fixed. If you did brick your device, update iTunes to the latest version and use it to restore your device. iOS 10 can run on the iPhone 5, iPad mini 2, iPad Air, iPad Pro, and sixth-generation iPod touch or later. Yes, the venerable iPad 2 and iPad mini have finally been dropped, as has the iPhone 4 series, so people with those older devices will have to stick with iOS 9 or earlier. I’ve spent all summer exploring iOS 10 while working on “iOS 10: A Take Control Crash Course,” and I’d like to share ten of the most useful and relevant highlights to help you make the most of iOS 10. How Do I Unlock It? -- The first major change you’ll notice with iOS 10 is that Swipe to Unlock, a trademark of the iPhone since the beginning, is gone. Also, you can’t unlock your Touch ID-equipped device by merely resting your finger on the Home button; there is a setting to return to the old Touch ID behavior, but first let me explain why Apple made this sure-to-be-controversial change. There are now two ways to unlock your device from the Lock screen: Touch ID: Place your finger on the Touch ID sensor. Notice how the lock icon at the top of the screen first says Unlocked and then vanishes. You can now press the Home button to get to the Home screen. With a bit of practice, you can master the art of “press, release, and linger” to unlock your Touch ID device and jump instantly to the Home screen (But keep reading, because you may not always want to do this). Just make sure that you don’t press and hold the Home button, because that summons Siri. Passcode: Press the Home button and then enter your passcode to reach the Home screen. So why is the venerable Slide to Unlock gone? Because when you swipe from left to right on the Lock screen now, you’re taken to the new Widgets screen. That’s right, widgets are no longer confined to Notification Center — they are now accessible from the Lock and Home screens as well. There’s also a new way to access the Camera app from the Lock screen: swipe from right to left. Press Home to return to the Lock screen from Camera. That explains Slide to Unlock, but why is it harder to unlock the device with Touch ID? Because, for security reasons, some widgets require authentication before you can use them. In the past, Touch ID would have taken you straight to the Home screen, defeating the purpose of making widgets accessible on the Lock screen. Also, notifications are smarter in iOS 10. Swipe one from right to left and tap View to see a list of actions, or 3D Touch the notification. These action lists will grow as developers take more advantage of iOS 10’s new notification tools, such as live notifications, which allow photos and even videos to be embedded in notifications. Again, in the past, unlocking meant going straight to the Home screen, dismissing all notifications, sometimes before you’d had a chance to see them. Now, with iOS 10, you can easily work on the Lock screen without unlocking and going to the Home screen. Wake up the phone by pressing and releasing the Home or Sleep/Wake buttons. If you need to authenticate to perform an action on the Lock screen, you can scan your fingerprint or enter your passcode without pressing the Home button and unlocking the device. Here’s an example of where this is useful: on the Lock screen, swipe from left to right to enter the Widgets screen. Scroll down and tap Edit. You’ll be prompted to use Touch ID or enter a passcode. If you have a device with Touch ID, now you can scan your finger without getting dumped into the Home screen. Also, if you have a newer iPhone — iPhone 6s or later — you can merely raise your phone to wake the screen, much like the Apple Watch. It’s a nice touch, but if you dislike it, disable Raise to Wake in Settings > Display & Brightness. These changes make the Lock screen far more powerful — you may not have to unlock your iOS device nearly as often! However, if you have trouble with the new Touch ID unlock behavior after trying it for a while, you can change it back in Settings > General > Accessibility > Home Button by enabling Rest Finger to Open. 3D Touch Everything -- If you don’t have an iPhone 6s or later, skip this tip. But if you do have one, you’ll be happy to see how many apps now support 3D Touch in interesting ways. In particular: If you 3D Touch an app icon that has an accompanying widget, iOS displays that widget in a popover. Seriously, try 3D Touching all the apps you use regularly for interesting shortcuts. 3D Touch the flashlight button in Control Center to set the intensity of the flashlight. Also, you can 3D Touch the timer button to choose a preset interval. If you have an iPhone 6s or later, but haven’t been enthused with 3D Touch, give it another try! Check Your Memories -- iOS 10 has revved up its artificial intelligence engine to make the Photos app a lot smarter with facial and object recognition. Try searching for “trees” or “dogs” and you might find that Photos shows separate results for different types of dogs and trees. You can even ask Siri to “search for photos of oak trees,” for instance. Apple also uses this new intelligence in a new view, called Memories. Memories are automated collections of photos and videos, collected by location, date, or even people in the photo. Here’s the problem Memories solves: you take thousands of pictures with your iPhone, but you rarely go back to look at them — there are just too many! Disciplined photographers sort their photos into albums, but most people don’t have time for that. Memories may take a while to generate after you install iOS 10, but since they’re added frequently, check back regularly. I’ve been enjoying them greatly. When you view Memories, you’ll notice that the header is a video. It takes a bit to generate once you tap play, but once it does, you’ll get a full slideshow with a soundtrack. You can edit those videos, and I explain how in “iOS 10: A Take Control Crash Course,” but the bigger problem is that Photos can generate collections of photos you don’t want to see. To get rid of a shabby memory, view it, scroll down, and tap Delete Memory. You can also tap Add to Favorite Memories to save the memory in the list. My recommendation is to check your Memories regularly, delete the ones you don’t want, and favorite those you like. It’s an easy way to build an archive of pleasant memories without sorting through thousands of photos. Filter Your Mail -- My favorite feature in iOS 10 Mail is that threads now display your own messages. That’s been my top iOS pet peeve for years, and it’s great to see Apple finally agreeing with me. Mail also offers two additional new features for making your inbox a saner, happier place. First, you can now filter mail in iOS. Filters aren’t like rules in Mail in macOS; they’re just a way to narrow what you see in a particular mailbox. Tap the new filter button in the lower left to apply a filter. If you look at the bottom-center of Mail, you see a Filtered By line. Tap that to adjust the filter. Second, Mail simplifies the task of unsubscribing from mailing lists. Open such a message from a mailing list, and you’ll see a banner at the top that says “This message is from a mailing list,” followed by an Unsubscribe link. Tap that, and then tap Unsubscribe again at the prompt to unsubscribe from that mailing list. Or dismiss the banner by tapping the X button to the side, which also prevents the banner from appearing on future messages from that list. Delete Stickers in Messages -- Messages includes a number of features that you’ll either find fun or annoying — or both. Press and hold the send button to see bubble and screen effects; tap the heart icon to see Digital Touch effects, or tap the App Store icon to see a wide variety of Messages apps. There’s so much new in Messages that I dedicated an entire chapter of “iOS 10: A Take Control Crash Course” to them. But one feature that I guarantee everyone will be talking about is stickers. Stickers are one of the many new app types in iOS 10 messages. You can tap one to insert it into a message, or press, hold, and drag a sticker to slap it on top of an existing message bubble. Stickers can be fun, but they can also be obnoxious. There’s no limit to the number of stickers that can be slapped on a message, which means that an annoying friend could obscure your entire conversation. When you receive a message bubble, press and hold it to see additional new options, including Sticker Details. Tap that to reveal a list of stickers in the conversation. Swipe a listing from right to left to reveal a delete button, which removes that sticker. Hopefully Apple will improve this interface throughout iOS 10’s lifespan, but this should help maintain your sanity for now. (Adam can’t figure out why anyone would put up with someone who would spam stickers; it’s easier to ignore or block someone with such annoying communication habits.) By the way, if you find the new bubble and screen effects irritating, you can reduce their effects by enabling Reduce Motion in Settings > General > Accessibility > Reduce Motion. Set News Notifications -- In iOS 10, the News app features a fresh, bold design. Notably, those whose vision isn’t perfect will appreciate the darker text and headlines. The app is also faster than before, and in the For You view, it adds new headers such as Top Stories, Trending Stories, Politics, Sports, and more to help you sort through the day’s news. What I’ve found the most useful are the new notifications you can enable in News. Go to the Favorites view and tap the bell in the upper left. On the Notifications screen, you can choose which of your favorite sources can send you notifications — all are disabled by default, but you may receive notifications when a favorite news source adds the notification feature. News also includes two Apple-provided notification sources: News Editors’ Picks and News Top Stories. I’m a fan of News Top Stories, which has so far sent me very few notifications and only for important news stories, unlike some other news apps that send “BREAKING!” notifications for the tiniest bit of trivia (cough CNN cough). Baby, You Can Find My Car -- Here’s an everyday problem: you park in a mall or a megastore with a sprawling parking lot, spend some time shopping, walk out, and… can’t remember where you parked. I do this all the time, and I always feel stupid wandering around the parking lot looking for my car. Maps in iOS 10 can solve your problem, but only if you have some sort of Bluetooth or CarPlay connection in your car, such as the manufacturer’s audio system, a third-party stereo, or something like a Bluetooth FM transmitter. (I’ve heard reports that this feature requires a manufacturer Bluetooth stereo. If you know otherwise, let me know in the comments!) If you have the appropriate equipment, check Settings > Maps and make sure that Show Parked Location is enabled — it should be on by default. After that, when you get out of your car, you should receive a notification on your iPhone telling you where you parked your car. When it’s time to find your car, you can either open that notification or ask Siri where your car is to get directions back to it. Collaborate with Notes -- The Notes app saw a lot of love from Apple in iOS 9, and it receives even more Apple affection in iOS 10 with the addition of note collaboration. Here is how to use it: in a note, tap the people icon, tap Add People, choose a contact method (in my testing, Messages worked best), and send an invite. Multiple people can collaborate on a note, and once they accept the invite, they can start making changes to the note. You can stop sharing by tapping the people icon again, and then either swiping a person from right to left or tapping Stop Sharing. Unfortunately, like iWork for iCloud, collaboration is rudimentary. You can’t see who’s currently in the document or who has made edits. However, for sharing simple lists and other things, it’s a handy way to collaborate with friends and family. Remove Tips -- Here’s a tip: you can now remove the Tips app, as well as many other bundled “junk” apps on iOS. Of course, one person’s trash is another’s treasure, but here’s the surprisingly large list of bundled apps you can remove: Calculator Calendar Compass Contacts FaceTime Find My Friends Home iBooks iCloud Drive iTunes Store Mail Maps Music News Notes Podcasts Reminders Stocks Tips Videos Voice Memos Watch Weather Note that “removing” an app doesn’t actually delete it from your device — iOS merely takes it off your Home screen. However, deleting the app will delete the data contained in the app. If you want to bring the app back again, search for it in the App Store and “reinstall” it. Read the Fine Print -- In “New Accessibility Features Coming to Apple’s Ecosystem” (11 August 2016), Steven Aquino wrote about the new Magnifier feature, which turns your iOS device into a magnifying glass. This capability has been offered by third-party apps for a while (see “Lumin Turns Your iPhone into an Illuminated Magnifier,” 4 January 2012), but in iOS 10, it’s available with a quick triple-press of the Home button. Enable it in General > Accessibility > Magnifier. The Magnifier looks remarkably similar to the Camera app. Use the slider to zoom in or out. Tap the shutter button to freeze the image in place — another quick tap on the viewfinder sharpens the image, which is useful if your hands were shaking. Other buttons turn on the flash, lock the focus, and add color filters. Even if you don’t have significant visual impairments, the Magnifier is super handy for checking the fine print on any document or reading tiny serial numbers. Bonus Tips -- iOS 10 has so many great features that I had trouble focusing on just ten. Here are a few more things to note: The Music app is a lot better now, and Apple Music now features two regularly updated playlists: My Favorites Mix, updated every Wednesday with your favorite tunes, and My New Music Mix, updated every Friday with new music that Apple’s algorithms think you’ll like. The new Home app is awesome. If you’ve been considering purchasing some HomeKit accessories, now is the time. I recommend the Philips Hue smart lightbulb system (see “Getting Started with the Philips Hue Smart Light Bulbs,” 1 August 2016). The Phone app now automatically transcribes your voicemails, at least in theory. Neither I nor most other TidBITS contributors yet see this feature, which Apple still labels as being in beta, so don’t worry if you aren’t getting transcripts either. Mail, Contacts, and Calendars are now three separate entries in the Settings app, which fixes another one of my iOS pet peeves. The keyboard click sound has been redesigned, and is surprisingly pleasant. If you usually leave Keyboard Clicks off in Settings > Sounds, try turning it on. Safari no longer limits the number of open tabs. Press and hold the Pages icon to see an option to close all tabs. There is so, so much more to iOS 10, and I’m speaking with some confidence about that, given that I just wrote a 143-page book about it. For complete coverage, check out “iOS 10: A Take Control Crash Course,” which covers every new feature in iOS 10, including a full chapter dedicated to HomeKit and the Home app. Check out the Take Control ebooks that expand on the topic in this article: iOS 10: A Take Control Crash Course Quickly master new (and existing) features in iOS 10 on your iPad, iPhone, or iPod touch!

Charles  2016-09-13 17:55 I like the News app a lot, especially since it contains all the free content that used to appear on the defunct NYTNow app. But I am appalled that there is no way to customize the For You page. I don't want to see the Entertainment section, it's not news, it's gossip. I'd like to mute the Sports channel too. If I swipe right, it gives an option to Mute Channel, but that doesn't mute the news section, it mutes the website the story is from, which might also provide stories I do want to see on other sections. Seth Anderson   2016-09-13 20:47 The voice mail transcription is not bad, but does have some flaws. Michel Hedley  2016-09-13 22:11 I think I will delay in upgrading given Apple's past efforts in bricking phones, losing Notes, adding crappy trivial features (such as stickers). Improvements to Mail are welcome. Find my Car and Magnify are nice features. Music and Photos will probably be the usual hit & miss - why would you store your photos on your phone/iCloud? I never remember to use Widgets or News and so will stick with press & linger. I hope the easy access to camera will not change. PS guys please stop using the American-centric term "Fall'. There's these terms called months and they are used all around the world. They are not hard to use. Adam Engst   2016-09-13 22:41 We try really hard to avoid season names for you Aussies, but sometimes either it just slips through, or there's no way to avoid it because there isn't a specific month possible. Michel Hedley  2016-09-14 00:47 Thanks - not just for Australia but everywhere else (other than US). Adam Engst   2016-09-14 11:32 Well, everywhere in the southern hemisphere, and from what we can tell from logs, that basically means readers in Australia and New Zealand, since we don't have too many readers in South America or below the equator in Africa. :-) Dennis B. Swaney  2016-09-15 19:44 Will "Autumn" do? ;-) David Emme  2016-09-15 20:38 re: "Fall": "Fall" (wherever & whenever it may occur) is a season, not a calendar month. And any given month does not have the same name "all around the world", even for peoples who use the same calendar. OK, help me out here. What term do you folks in the southern hemisphere use so that we in the northern hemisphere don't get confused / offended / whatever? Wandering Willy  2016-09-20 02:23 Autumn Simon   2016-09-13 23:53 "3D Touch Everything -- If you don’t have an iPhone 6s or later, skip this tip." So does that mean tap and hold won't enable the same functionality on a pre-3D touch iPhone? Josh Centers   2016-09-14 16:19 No, sorry. Simon   2016-09-14 17:01 Bummer. But thanks for checking. :) Rob Russell  2016-09-14 03:44 Trying to grok how News works. I understood it isn't available here in NZ yet I can get it on my ancient iPad 2 but not my iPhone 6s Plus. Yet the News notifications (from Radio NZ) on my 6sPlus appear on the notifications screen. Interesting and confusing at the same time. Alan Ralph  2016-09-14 04:39 Not hugely surprised that my 3rd-generation iPad and iPhone 4S won't be getting iOS 10. To be honest, I was very surprised that they qualified for iOS 9. Have definitely gotten good service out of both devices, though, so not complaining. Adam Engst   2016-09-14 11:34 I didn't quite want to say this, but it's probably best to drop the older devices off the back rather than have those people suffer performance problems. jdh  2016-09-14 09:47 New to Mail in iOS -- finally! If you are security conscious and don't automatically display images in your received emails, you previously had to scroll all the way to the end of the email to Load Images. For many emails (e.g., Costco or B&H Photo), you frequently had a very long scroll. In iOS 10, Mail finally has moved the button to allow "Load Images" to the top (beginning) of the email, as it is in Mail on the Mac. Josh Centers   2016-09-14 16:19 Very nice! That's a small detail I missed. Colleen Thompson  2016-09-20 10:10 Yay! Bill Abbott  2016-09-15 18:43 The health app is FUBAR, fouled up beyond all recognition. It used to open to whatever data screen you chose but now you have to wade though a bunch of nonsense that you don't want to get to the Steps, Distance, Weight data screens. And there is NO apparent way to manually add daily weight data! What a loser. I simply reverted to iOS 9.3.5. Goodbye 10, for now. Josh Centers   2016-09-14 16:20 Sorry to hear it. I cut the Health chapter from the book because I didn't think anyone used it. gastropod  2016-09-14 17:24 I use the Health app despite the warts, because there's no reliable way to audit third party apps to see what they send home, or to block them from phoning home completely. Once you give them permission to look at your data, they own your data, and I really don't care what they claim. Too many counter-examples. I dump the data to the desktop occasionally in hopes that a decent Mac app will appear that can be blocked with Snitch. Bill Abbott  2016-09-15 18:48 I'm sorry too. I'm recovering from a hip replacement and how much am walking is pretty important to me. I use the app every day and convenience is king. Martin Lindower  2016-09-20 23:49 You can manually add weight data by tapping the + sign in the upper right corner of the screen. Jeff Swart  2016-09-14 13:47 Thanks Josh, for your review and insights. soooo, we have an iMac and MacBook Pro that aren't supported by macOS 10.12 Sierra and and iPhone 6. At what point would it be prudent to stop upgrading iOS to maintain interoperabilty with our iMac & MBP? I imagine it's partially related to iTunes support for our Macs, just wondering if you have any sage advice in this matter. Thanks in advance for your consideration Josh Centers   2016-09-14 16:23 I'm not entirely sure, but I'm on El Capitan, and I haven't noticed any egregious compatibility issues (though the new Messages stuff looks funny). I would keep an eye on iTunes compatibility. iTunes 12.5.1, which is needed to sync with iOS 10, is compatible with OS X 10.9.5, so you'll probably be safe for a couple of years. Jim Clarke  2016-09-15 13:46 I find that signing in with Touch ID works the same as it used to unless I'm very careful. Pressing the home button with my registered digit (thumb) and then keeping it held down gets me right in. That's what I'm used to. To get the new behaviour I have to think, then use a non-registered digit to press, and then my thumb to just touch without pressing. Maybe I'll learn -- if I want that widget stuff. Michael Paine  2016-09-16 17:50 Great tips thanks Josh. The car parking feature seems a little intermittent but it is a great feature to demonstrate how a device can work away in the background to assist you. Tom and Barbara Greenspon   2016-09-17 12:56 Oh my, I need a bit of help. I have downloaded the "Crash Course" but I can't figure out how to look up what I need. Here's my question: for various reasons, I had used the "auto-lock" to say "never" when I was downloading the new iOS update. But when the new iOS 10 update was installed, there is no longer a way to get there that I can find. Please help! I do not want to leave it on "never". Its driving me nuts. I know I can use the switch to turn if off, but I'd like to do it automatically after a minute or so. Thanks. Tom and Barbara Greenspon   2016-09-17 12:58 Oh, I'm embarrassed! I just found it. It moved to such a logical place -- display and brightness. Sorry! Dennis B. Swaney  2016-09-19 22:44 That is NOT logical at all. It makes as much sense as my XM radio that has the "power on/off with car power" setting under the "Time" menu item. The AutoLock setting in iOS should be on the main Settings screen at the top. steve12  2016-09-19 23:14 The car location feature works for me with a BlackBerry Bluetooth adapter which is plugged into my aux port. There's got to be more to it than just Bluetooth though since using my BT head phones which use the same BT profile as as the Blackberry gateway. Perhaps it needs to notice you're traveling faster than human speeds? Graham Samuel  2016-09-20 04:25 It's 20th September and here in Europe (I'm in France but my devices are set to UK) there's no sign of iOS 10. Anyone know when it's due? PhD  2016-09-20 07:57 (from Belgium) : Since end of last week, on my iPhone 5SE, went to "Réglages" (Settings) then "Général" and there, "Mise à jour logicielle" (Updating Software) where a full page gave me informations about IOS 10 being ready, with the choice of "En savoir plus" (More info) or "Télécharger et installer" (Download & Install). I didn't execute the download though, I was holding on for the much awaited comments from TidBits. Graham Samuel  2016-09-20 12:17 Just tried again - got "you have. iOS 9.3.5. Your software is up to date. Belgium is the centre of Europe, apparently. But you already knew that. Curtis Wilcox   2016-09-20 22:03 Which device do you have? Maybe it's too old to run iOS 10. The list of supported devices is near the bottom of this page: http://www.apple.com/ios/ios-10/ Graham Samuel  2016-09-22 13:28 Nope, looks like both my iPhone 5 and my iPad mini qualify. My early iPad original size probably doesn't. Is there anyone reading this from the UK - have you got the update? Kyle McGee  2016-09-20 10:44 Agreed.. Kyle McGee  2016-09-20 10:43 I'm really confused why notifications got worse for non-3d touch users. Before, a notification would come up and I could immediately see options by swiping left from the lock screen. Now, I have to choose view or clear first and then select the option I want. Also, the whole screen dissolves when the options are shown (iPhone open). Before, the simply showed the options on top of my normal screen. Why did they change this? Do you think they might fix this? Josh Centers   2016-09-20 15:12 It's a good question. I'd say that it's because Apple wants you to use 3D Touch, but that's not available on the iPad. I think the simple reason is that the new method allows for a longer list of actions for notifications. Eric Lindgren   2016-09-23 04:35 iTunes 12.5.1 on MBP 2010 El Cap offered iOS 10 update sized at 2.29 GB. However over the air direct to my iPad retina 2 running iOS 9.3.5 is only 1.0 GB. My DL speed will do 1 GB in 3 hours, and I have a data cap, so I really appreciate the smaller size. Kathryn  2016-09-24 16:11 I used the left swipe to open the camera today and the pictures that I took cannot be downloaded to my MacBook Pro. The MacBook message says that the screen is locked but it isn't. I t was only locked when I took the pictures. How do I get around this??? Adam Engst   2016-09-24 18:34 I've never heard of anything like that. Did you unlock the iPhone after taking the pictures but before trying to download to the Mac? Perhaps if that hadn't happened... Also, from the sounds of it, you're transferring directly to Photos, not using iCloud's My Photo Stream or iCloud Photo Library?  Search   Unless otherwise noted, this article is copyright © 2016 Josh Centers TidBITS is copyright © 2016 TidBITS Publishing Inc.

Energy companies are trading lower as the price of oil continues to slip. Stocks are fairly calm after three days of big, erratic moves, but bond yields are falling after a big increase a day earlier. KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 21 points, or 0.1 percent, to reach 18,087 as of 1:40 p.m. Eastern time. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index rose 4 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,130. The Nasdaq composite climbed 27 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,182. Stocks are at their lowest levels in two months after big losses Friday and Tuesday. In between came a big gain on Monday. WHERE TO? Investors have sent stocks in different directions as they wonder if the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next week, and they’re also speculating about the health of the global economy. Bond prices also reflected that confusion as they changed direction once again, as yields fell and prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.69 percent. A day earlier it jumped to 1.73 percent, the highest in almost three months. The fall in bond yields helped high-dividend utility companies, which became more appealing to investors seeking income. Consolidated Edison gained 91 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $74.14 and Sempra Energy gained $1.15, or 1.1 percent, to $103.68. PLANT A SEED: After four months of public negotiations, seed and weedkiller maker Monsanto agreed to be bought by German drug and farm chemical company Bayer. Bayer’s latest offer is worth about $57 billion in cash. Bayer makes a wide range of crop protection chemicals that kill weeds, bugs and fungus, while Monsanto is known for its seeds business and the weedkiller Glyphosate. It rose $1.01, or 1 percent, to $107.11. TECH TIP TOP: Apple picked up $4.68, or 4.3 percent, to $112.63, for its second day of big gains. Apple rose Tuesday after T-Mobile said it’s getting strong preorders for the new iPhones. Apple gets most of its revenue from the iPhone, and those sales, while still enormous, have finally started to decline in the last year. That’s hurt Apple stock, which traded above $130 a little more than a year ago. Other gainers included customer-management software developer Salesforce.com, which added $1.22, or 1.7 percent, to reach $74.29. OIL: Benchmark New York crude fell 94 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $43.96 a barrel in New York. The international standard, Brent crude, fell 85 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $46.25 a barrel in London. U.S. crude prices fell 3 percent Tuesday and energy companies continued to fall Wednesday. Chevron gave up 36 cents to get to $99.07 and Murphy Oil lost $1.14, or 4.4 percent, to reach $25. NO FIESTA: Ford dipped 18 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $12.21 after it said its pretax profit will fall this year. Ford also said its results will weaken further in 2017 as the company invests more money in electric and autonomous cars, among other areas, and costs rise. The automaker expects results to start improving in 2018. LIVELY: Dermatology drug developer Vitae Pharmaceuticals soared to $20.86 after it agreed to be bought by Allergan, the maker of Botox. The deal values Vitae at $21 per share, or $606 million. Vitae, which doesn’t have any approved products, closed at $8.10 on Tuesday. Allergan rose $6.13, or 2.6 percent, to $246.23. STEEL STAINED: Nucor stumbled after it forecast a smaller profit than investors expected for the third quarter. The steelmaker said it expects to earn between 85 cents and 95 cents a share, while FactSet said investors were expecting $1.03 per share on average. The stock declined 57 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $45.45. IN THE WEEDS: Cracker Barrel Old Country Store fell $9.95, or 6.6 percent, to $140.58 after investors weren’t impressed with the restaurant chain’s projections for the current fiscal year. CURRENCIES: The dollar fell to 102.38 yen from 102.72 yen. The euro rose to $1.1259 from $1.1208. OVERSEAS: The CAC 40 in France fell 0.4 percent and Germany’s DAX edged up 0.1 percent. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares rose 0.1 percent. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 lost 0.7 percent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was down 0.1 percent. South Korean markets were closed for a national holiday.

Finance Search Sat, Nov 19, 2016, 1:38 AM AEDT - Australia Markets closed EU lawmakers hail "superheroine" Vestager over Apple tax billAFP – Wed, Sep 14, 2016 7:05 PM AEST Recommend 0 Tweet 0 Share0 Print Related Content View Photo European Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager speaks at a debate on the EU's Apple ruling in back taxes at the European Parliament in Strasbourg, eastern France, on September 14, 2016 Members of the European parliament on Wednesday hailed EU anti-trust commissioner Margrethe Vestager as a "superheroine" for handing US tech giant Apple a 13 billion euro tax bill in Ireland. For more than one hour during a debate about her August 30 ruling, almost all of the 30 MEPs who took the floor congratulated Vestager, a Danish politician with a steely reputation who smiled, took notes with a pink pen and thanked the speakers. "When I was young in the 1970s, there was a television series, 'the six million dollar man,'" Dutch liberal politician Cora van Nieuwenhuizen told her. "This superhero has been surpassed by a superheroine, the 13 billion euro ($15 billion) commissioner!" Philippe Lamberts, the Belgian co-president of the Green Party, also offered effusive praise. "As an ecologist, I am opposed to human cloning, and yet, when I see you, I really want multiple Margrethe Vestagers," Lamberts said. More compliments flowed from politicians like French socialist Pervenche Beres, who made her point raising her iPhone 6. "We are all drugged, intoxicated by these machines. However, we are overjoyed that you have so severely punished this company," Beres said. German ecologist Sven Giegold chimed in, saying: "We should give you a prize." In announcing the ruling, Vestager said that Apple had received favourable tax terms that amounted to state aid -- illegal under its rules -- and ordered Ireland to collect the back taxes. The ruling has angered Apple as well as the US and Irish governments. Ireland plans to challenge the ruling amid fears that accepting the windfall could scare away international investment and undermine a reputation for business-friendliness. It came amid growing tensions between Washington and Brussels over a series of EU anti-trust investigations led by Vestager targeting other giant US companies such as Google, Amazon, McDonald's, Starbucks and Fiat Chrysler. The daughter of two Lutheran ministers, Vestager is known for her no-nonsense style. And those who know her warn that she is a formidable negotiator who never gives up. Sometimes nicknamed back home as "Margrethe III," an allusion to Denmark's Queen Margrethe II, she became her country's first woman minister, at the age of 29, when she was named in 1998 to the education and ecclesiastical affairs portfolio. And under her leadership, her party doubled its performance in the 2011 parliamentary elections. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Top Stories » Water fight could drench backpacker billAAP A stoush over water reform could sink the government's hopes of getting its backpacker tax through parliament. … VW to cut 30,000 jobs, 23,000 in GermanyAAP Kogan welcomes prospect of AmazonAAP Crean enlisted to help Latrobe ValleyAAP Sponsored  Market Data Currencies Currencies Name Price Change % Chg AUD / USD 0.7381 -0.0035 -0.47% AUD/USD AUD / GBP 0.5976 +0.0007 +0.12% AUD/GBP AUD / EUR 0.6950 -0.0027 -0.39% AUD/EUR Go To Currency Converter » On This Site HOME NEWS & OPINION TAX TIME 2016 INVESTING MY PORTFOLIOS PERSONAL FINANCE VIDEO Expert Opinion ALSO ON YAHOO7 Mail Stocks & Shares Forum Meet Single Women Meet Single Men TV Guide Easy Recipe Ideas Go Travelling Tips To Great Sex Breaking News Find Your Dream Car Weather Forecast Find A Job All Yahoo7 Services » Trending Now Golden pheasant Health insurance ISIS Melbourne Cheap international flights 457 visa program Mobile phone Leonard Cohen Adelaide Accommodation Brendan Dassey iPad Help / Suggestions Privacy Terms Quotes are real-time for NASDAQ, NYSE, and NYSEAmex when available.

Anita Balakrishnan | @MsABalakrishnan Wednesday, 14 Sep 2016 | 3:54 PM ETCNBC.com SHARES Andrew Harrer | Bloomberg | Getty Images A customer stands at a counter inside a Verizon Wireless retail store in Washington, D.C. Apple's stock lost some steam on Wednesday amid mixed reports of carrier pre-order volume, but managed to hang on to a win streak, ending the day in the green. Verizon's iPhone 7 pre-order volume is within normal range, according to a Verizon executive. But AT&T volumes are up year-over-year. Apple's shares trimmed gains after the report, closing up about 3.5 percent at $111.77 a share. It had be seen as high as $113.03, after mobile service carriers Sprint and T-Mobile on Tuesday reporting strong pre-orders. Shares still sealed their first three-day win streak with consecutive gains over 2 percent since April 2013, more than doubling 30-day average volume during the session. In a webcast of the Bank of America Merrill Lynch 2016 Media, Communications and Entertainment Conference, Marni Walden, executive vice president and president of product innovation and new business at Verizon, addressed recent iPhone sales: Moderator: "Some of the competitors in the market have been talking about 4x increases in volumes for iPhone sales. The media has assumed that this is a function of $0 trade-ins and inferring maybe that there is big market share movements or big margin implications for the industry. I wonder if you can speak maybe to, what is Verizon's iPhone experience? Has this been a game changer, or what's the story?" Walden: "I think when people talk about percentages increase it's all about, 'Compared to what?' If you look at Verizon, we had the iPhone second, so your upgrade cycles depend a lot on that, how big your base is, so you know, we're not going to comment on volume, but I would say you've got to ask the question of what it's compared to …." Moderator: "Would you say this is a churn and margin impact for Verizon, or is it more a business as usual upgrade cycle for the iPhone?" Walden: "We think it's more of a business as usual for us." Volumes of the iPhone 7 at AT&T are up year-over-year and are ahead of expectations, John Stephens, senior executive vice president and chief financial officer at AT&T, said in the conference webcast, though he noted it has only been a few days since pre-orders began. "The reality is as one of the biggest providers of the iPhone services, our sales are up. We have seen a real improvement, exceeding our expectations," Stephens said. "Now we've got a promo out there, and you would hope the promos would be effective and they certainly are. With that we're going to make an investment in those customers but these are our best customers." Bloomberg originally reported the conference comments. CNBC has reached out to the companies for further comment. show chapters <p>Apple a solid value play?</p> <p>Ben Schachter, Macquarie Research Apple Analyst, discusses the nine-month high in Apple shares as it currently leads the Dow.</p> Apple a solid value play?    Wednesday, 14 Sep 2016 | 2:00 PM ET | 02:20 "I think it's people happy with the iPhone 7," Ben Schachter, senior analyst at Macquarie Group, told CNBC's "Power Lunch" on Wednesday. "Not too long ago, people were afraid that the iPhone had had its best days, and it was going to be a decliner in perpetuity going forward. Now people seem to be pretty comfortable that you can be flat, to maybe a little bit of growth this year, and ... heading into the ten year anniversary next year, that should be a more meaningful upgrade cycle for them." "I think in general, you're having more and more folks from different areas looking at Apple — you have guys looking at the dividend, growth, as well as some people excited about what growth can be in the software side of the business, which we think is still under-appreciated by investors and we think could be a meaningful investment going forward," Schachter said. It comes after Sprint announced pre-orders of the new iPhones were up more than 375 percent in the first three days compared to last year. T-Mobile, meanwhile, said iPhone pre-orders had broken previous records, up nearly 4 times compared to the next most popular iPhone, topping pre-registrations for the iPhone 6S and the popular iPhone 6. "For a company where the concern was hey, this phone is not that different from the past two and it maybe wasn't going to excite people, following quarters where the upgrade cycles were down … this is the first true fundamental data point that might be indicative that the company can actually return to growth in the December quarter," BTIG analyst Walter Piecyk told "Closing Bell." Industry watchers have given the new handset reviews that are solid, but not earth-shattering. Still, Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said that the pool of existing iPhone users is about 50 percent higher than two years ago, which could raise iPhone sales to consumers in need of an upgrade, regardless of the 7's specs. "It's tricky to know exactly how many might upgrade this year, for the 7, and how many might wait," Sacconaghi told CNBC's "Squawk Alley" on Tuesday. "Part of the issue is that Apple is now in its mature phase of the iPhone evolution. Five years ago, only about 25 percent of the people purchasing an iPhone were upgrading. Today it's about 80 percent." Apple itself said it will not release first-weekend sales of its new iPhone 7, saying that initial sales will be "governed by supply, not demand." "As we have expanded our distribution through carriers and resellers to hundreds of thousands of locations around the world, we are now at a point where we know before taking the first customer pre-order that we will sell out of iPhone 7," Apple spokeswoman Kristin Huguet told Reuters. Though industry watchers are left guessing how well the phone has performed, the opening sales figures "were never a great read on demand for the phone," said Gene Munster, a senior research analyst at Piper Jaffray. "While investors tracked these numbers ... they were influenced by adding new launch countries and the amount of inventory Apple produced and sold into carriers and retail partners," Munster wrote in a research note. "Pre-order numbers were a better indicator of demand, but Apple did not give them regularly. ... We don't view the change in policy as a sign that Apple has low expectations for the launch, but rather as a decision to get out of sharing a metric that could not grow forever." — Reporting by CNBC's Gina Francolla, Cara Caruso and Peter Schacknow Anita BalakrishnanNews Associate Related Securities Symbol Price   Change %Change VZ --- AAPL --- SHOW COMMENTS Please add a username to view or add comments Public Username for Commenting JOIN THE DISCUSSION To learn more about how we use your information, please read our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.

Apple apparently received this word to the wise already, putting it on full display in their new 30-second ad for the iPhone 7. Scary forest imagery, an owl's eye, a deer, a boxer, that same owl turning around, and some ominous rain? This clip has it all and, if you're so inclined, would probably pair nicely with The Cure's entire discography on an endless loop. Related You Can Already Buy a Cord to Prevent From Losing Your Apple AirPods Don't Expect to Get That Jet Black iPhone 7 Anytime Soon Everything You Need to Know From the Apple Keynote Event To complete the ensemble, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will be available in fresh jet black and matte black finishes. Upon the launch of the crowded-ass pre-order action last week, many bummed gloom enthusiasts were quickly met with the realization that copping a jet black iPhone 7 would most likely require a remarkably unfair amount of waiting. Maybe the new iPhone's somber marketing strategy is inspired by Apple's decision to hit the aux cord with a sudden RIP, choosing instead to start bowing down to the Lightning gods full-time for the foreseeable future. Speaking at the company's keynote event Sept. 8, Apple CEO Tim Cook said the decision to off the aux cord was a decision based in "courage." Death of the aux cord aside, Apple is once again riding high on the wave of excitement surrounding another hyped device release. Apple shares hit their highest level in 9 months Wednesday, with CNBC reporting the company saw a 4 percent jump. On Tuesday, Apple also dropped some major changes on iPhoners with the (briefly bricky) release of the iOS 10 update.

Now that iOS 10 is available to the public, websites have started rolling out support for the Apple Pay on the web feature. Time Inc. today announced that its customers are now able to use Apple Pay to purchase subscriptions for its line of magazines, including Sports Illustrated, People, Entertainment Weekly, and Real Simple. Last week, online retailer Wayfair announced support for Apple Pay on the web, giving shoppers an option to pay for furniture and home décor products through Apple Pay. Apple, of course, is accepting Apple Pay on its website too. Backend payment services including Big Commerce, Shopify, Stripe, and Squarespace have all announced support for Apple Pay on the web, giving smaller merchants an easy way to accept Apple Pay payments for purchases. In the coming weeks, we should see Apple Pay rolling out to many websites, giving customers an alternative to existing payment services like PayPal. With Apple Pay, purchases can be made with a single touch, and there's no need to enter credit card or shipping details. Apple Pay is also secure, keeping card numbers and other personal information out of the hands of vendors. When macOS Sierra is released to the public next Tuesday, Apple Pay on the web will also be available on the Mac. As with Apple Pay on the iPhone, purchases will be authenticated through a connection with an iPhone 6 or later or an authenticated Apple Watch. According to Apple, macOS Sierra's Apple Pay on the web feature will be available to all customers who have a Handoff-enabled Mac that is able to run the Sierra operating system. On mobile devices, Apple Pay on the web is available on the iPhone 6 and later, the iPad Pro, the iPad Air 2, and the iPad mini 3 and later.

In terms of iPhone and iPads, Apple Pay requires both Touch ID and the Secure Element ('https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203027'), which the 5S lacks (it has Touch ID and the older Secure Enclave, which only holds Health data and Touch ID). Because of this, you could verify your identity, but your card data would still need to be stored somewhere. This is where an iPhone (presumably 6/6S/SE/7) or Apple Watch with Apple Pay will work in tandem with your Mac. I don't see why they couldn't allow an iPad with Apple Pay to conduct the transaction, or an Apple Watch for in-app purchases on older devices, but that muddies the water a bit from the old matrix of "iPad = in-app only, iPhone = in-app and in-store, Watch = in-store" Arguably, the 5S is an excellent older phone, but some of the features do require hardware, not just software. Rating: 3 Votes Euge 9 weeks ago I just wish the rollout would be quicker worldwide. In the Czech Republic, contactless payments have been used for years as they are most of Europe, not sure if it's the legislation or just deals with banks. When I was in Prague I used it twice. Both times the people were amazed that I paid with my phone. So it definitely works with US cards; I think it's the bank side of things that need to be worked out.

It's more about the ecosystem, strengthening the case for buying and staying with Apple products. Same with iMessage, Apple Music, etc...

I’ve always been fascinated by antique sleeper lots (lots that achieve sudden, unexpected success after initially attracting little attention). Antique Sleeper: Melted Macintosh SE: $1,200 This melted Macintosh SE computer far surpassed preauction estimates at Roland Auctions in August.Photos courtesy Roland Auctioneers & Valuers, New York, www.rolandsantiques.com Kicking off today’s tour of the odd and unbelievable is a lot sold through Roland Auctioneers & Valuers on August 23. Originally estimated at $20 to $100, with the starting bid at just $10, a damaged and melted Macintosh computer that was damaged by an external fire, sold for an amazing $1,200, excluding buyer’s premium. The computer (modern art?) has no hard drive and measures 12 inches wide by 13 inches high by 11 inches deep. It is just one of the more than 600 items consigned from The Tekserve Collection upon the store’s August 15 closing. (Tekserve, which predated the Apple stores, was a popular independent repair shop for Apple products in New York City.) Perhaps this lot illustrates just how hot collecting early tech devices has become. Antique Sleeper: Apple director-style chairs: $800 This pair of Apple director-style chairs greatly exceeded auction estimates. A pair of folding, director-style arm chairs with “Apple” and the multicolored Apple logo emblazoned across the removable backs – also from The Tekserve Collection and sold by Roland Auctioneers – brought similar surprising results. The chairs were originally estimated to sell for $50 to $100. They hammered down at $800. Measuring 21 inches wide by 34 inches high by 15 inches deep, they are in overall good condition with minor scratches and nicks. Antique Sleeper: Military badges and lapel pins: $5,400 A lot comprised of a group of military badges and lapel pins sold through John Moran Auctioneers (Monrovia, California) also brought dramatic results. Conservatively estimated to earn $500 to $700, the 35-piece lot realized $5,400 (including buyer’s premium) when it sold during Moran’s July 30 Decorative Arts Auction. The auction catalog describes the lot as: “Late 19th/early 20th century, comprising medals from the UK, France, New Zealand, Australia, and Canada, including various WWI-era badges and one Crimea Medal with Sebastopol Clasp and Medal for Distinguished Conduct engraved to Lieutenant J. Cusack, L.T.C., 97th Regiment.” This collection of military medals and pins brought nearly eight times its high presale estimate at John Moran Auctioneers in July.

Photo courtesy Jeffrey S. Evans & Associates, www.jeffreysevans.com Another surprise on July 30 was enjoyed at Jeffrey S. Evans & Associates in Virginia, where an opaque white owl milk pitcher, measuring 7 1/2 inches high and featuring its original glass eyes, sold for $585 (including buyer’s premium) against an estimate of just $50 to $80. The late 19th century pitcher (undamaged) was made by Bryce, Higbee & Co. (and others) and is from the collection of the late James S. Wilkins of Waxahachie, Texas. Although the lots included here are diverse in nature, they all have one thing in common: They likely resulted in cheerful surprises for the consignors and auctioneers. Conservative estimates help keep consignors from setting their hopes too high, and may even encourage bidders to jump into the fray. But who doesn’t enjoy an auction result that eclipses the estimate by ten-fold — or more. It only takes two bidders who are willing to battle over any particular lot to chuck estimates out the window.

X EU commissioner Margrethe Vestager defends her Apple tax findings MEPs from across political divide support tax ruling against Ireland Wed, Sep 14, 2016, 11:48 Suzanne Lynch European Correspondent Margrethe Vestager, the competition commissioner “We have a robust decision and we will defend it in court.” Photograph: Reuters         EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager has launched a staunch defence of her finding that Ireland granted billions of euro in illegal state aid to Apple, as MEPs overwhelmingly endorsed the European Commission’s adverse ruling against the State. Addressing the European Parliament in Strasbourg during a scheduled debate on the landmark Apple ruling, Ms Vestager said Apple had paid only 0.005 per cent tax in 2014, representing €50 of every €1 million in profit made in Ireland. “If taxes are not being paid by some, then they have to be paid by others, and that is why it is not fair competition when some member states hand out selective tax benefits.” She said it was the responsibility of member states to ensure their national tax legislation is compliant with EU state aid rules, noting that the EU treaties invested the competition arm with the power to investigate breaches of state-aid law, whether in the form of cash, land or taxation. “We have a robust decision and we will defend it in court,” she said. Once the full decision is published, tax authorities in other member states could assess if they were liable to reclaim unpaid taxes under national tax rules, she added. European Commission refuses to comment on Noonan claims EU tax harmonisation: an issue that won’t go away Apple expects to offset €13bn Irish tax bill by paying less in US “Looking ahead, it is the goal that all companies, big or small, pay taxes where they generate their profits.,” she said. MEPs from across the political divide voiced support for the European Commissioner’s finding against Ireland, with a number of MEPs complimenting the Danish commissioner on her “courage” and “bravery.” Fine Gael’s Seán Kelly and Brian Hayes were among the few MEPs to question the commission’s decision, while Sinn Féin’s Matt Carthy criticised Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil’s decision to appeal the ruling. Corporate tax A number of MEPs urged the European Commission during the debate to come forward with robust proposals on a common consolidated corporate tax base (CCCTB) in the coming months. A proposal is expected from European commissioner for economic and financial affairs, taxation and customs Pierre Moscovici by November. Earlier, European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker vowed to continue the clamp down on tax evasion. ADVERTISEMENT “A fair playing field means that in Europe consumers are protected from cartels and abuses by powerful companies, and that every company, no matter how big or small, has to pay its taxes where it makes its profits,” he said in his annual “state of the union” speech to the European Parliament. While his written speech, which was later released by the commission, referenced Ireland’s tax practices and the Apple case, Mr Juncker excluded any mention of either in his address to the chamber. Separately, Ms Vestager confirmed to Bloomberg News yesterday that the commission is investigating allegations that Ikea benefited from at least €1 billion in illegal state aid, though she added the investigation was at a very early stage. Ms Vestager confirmed the commission had received documentation relating to an investigation into Ikea’s tax activities by the Green group in the European Parliament earlier this year . “We have received the documentation that the Greens have made and we are going through it but we have nothing to comment as the case stands right now,” she said.       Topics: Apple tax Jean Claude Juncker Matt Carthy Sean Kelly Wolfgang Schauble Apple Read More Cantillon: Apple’s Irish tax woes the least of its problems No state-aid inquiries expected after Apple case, says Kenny Margrethe Vestager not afraid to take on Europe’s taxing issues Commission may examine 300 more Irish tax rulings Revenue chairman disputes Apple claims of 2% tax deal EU not investigating Google’s European tax deals – Vestager ‘Irish Times’ poll: Majority support appeal of Apple ruling Leading US politicians criticise EU ruling on Apple Apple’s €13bn Irish tax bill does not contain seeds of change Apple claims it paid $800m tax on European profits in 2014 Business Podcast: Making sense of the Apple ruling Independent Ministers demand early recall of Dáil to debate Apple appeal Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Financial Services Aviva to become full-fledged subsidiary of UK parent once again Work Pre-meetings key to successful meetings on contentious issues International Rory Best: We need our best performance ever Business Fold-away €5 bike helmet wins Dyson award Sponsored Designing the F-Pace: the story of Jaguar's best-seller HR managers need a simplified approach to pensions World-first tech restores mains electricity to Aran Islands Newbridge Silverware builds ambitious plan for US market ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Latest Business Draghi warns against giving Central Bank powers to cap mortgage rates 14:13 UK housebuilders find lenders more cautious after Brexit vote 13:58 Hammond faces tricky juggling act in first autumn statement 13:49 Aviva to become full-fledged subsidiary of UK parent once again 13:16 Volkswagen to cut 30,000 jobs in historic shake-up 13:11 ADVERTISEMENT Tech Tools Review: Vivofit Jr, an activity tracker for kids Fool your children into activity by turning it into a game Prynt prints your smartphone photos – and adds video Tech Tools: It’s augmented reality meets actual reality with the help of Zink technology Smart wifi plug gives you the power to control the power Tech Tools: TP Link device means you can use home appliances from your smartphone Could sleep problems be a thing of the past with Sense?

The real estate magnate got $4.96 billion in free earned media in the year leading up to the presidential election, according to data from tracking firm mediaQuant. Over the past 12 months, the president-elect received more than $800 million in free earned broadcast media, compared to $666 million for Clinton, and $2.6 billion in free earned online news attention, compared to $1.6 billion for his rival. He edged out her and other major political names in American and worldwide newspapers as well.

Fueled by U.S. wireless carriers' reports of strong early orders for the iPhone 7 as well as arch-rival Samsung Electronics' widely publicized recall of potentially exploding Galaxy Note 7 smartphones, shares of Apple were up 4.6 percent at $112.57 and had gained 7 percent in the past two days. Quotes in the article Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 109.95 -0.04 -0.04% Samsung Electronics Co Ltd SSNLF ▼ 1,250.00 -175.00 -12.28% Microsoft Corp MSFT ▲ 60.64 +0.99 +1.66% Sprint Corp S ▼ 7.49 -0.19 -2.47% Its market capitalization reached nearly $607 billion, compared with $535 billion for Alphabet and $440 billion for Microsoft. After sinking to a two-year low in July that had portfolio managers describing Apple as a value stock and no longer a growth play, shares of the world's most valuable listed company have since rebounded 25 percent. On Tuesday, Sprint said pre-orders for the iPhone 7 were up nearly four times compared to last year's iPhone. T-Mobile said pre-orders rose nearly four times compared with its next most popular iPhone. Potentially adding to demand for Apple's products, China's quality watchdog said on Wednesday that Samsung would recall 1,858 of its Galaxy Note 7 phones due to its fire-prone batteries, expanding the list of countries where the devices have been recalled. "With the carriers telling Samsung owners that Samsung wants you to take your phone back into the store, well, people are going to look elsewhere," said Longbow Research analyst Shawn Harrison.© Reuters Specific details about sales of the new iPhone are scarce after Apple announced last week it would not release weekend sales data, saying the number was more a reflection of supply than demand. With U.S. consumers less eager than in the past to replace their devices, global smartphone shipments are likely to grow less than 2 percent in 2016, compared to 10 percent last year, according to market research firm IDC. Revenue for Apple's fiscal year ending this month is likely to fall 8 percent and then grow 4 percent next year, according to the average estimate of analysts tracked by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Apple iMessage Is Much Better Apple's iMessage has received a makeover in iOS 10. The app now includes the ability for users to digitally "write" messages to others, instead of just sending text, as well as access to rich links that provide previews to content shared by senders. The app features support for stickers that can be appended to content, as well as a new "invisible ink" feature so messages can remain hidden until the recipient reveals them. The Value of 3D Touch Those who own the iPhone 6s or newer models of the handset will benefit from new 3D Touch features built into iOS 10. The operating system will come with the ability for users to vary the amount of pressure they apply to the screen and get a quick glance at important information, including what the weather will be like, upcoming calendar events and more. Apple is essentially using 3D Touch as a way to get users easy access to information it previously took a few taps to get to. There's a Reliability Factor to Consider Apple has been testing iOS 10 for the last several months to get as many hands on its operating system as possible and find glitches that could cause it to break down. More importantly, it has wanted to make sure the operating system's new features work as prescribed. All of that should give users some confidence in knowing iOS 10 is more reliable than its early install problems might suggest. Third-Party Siri Integration Matters For years, Apple has kept its virtual personal assistant Siri under wraps, but in iOS 10, that has all changed. Now, third-party app developers can access Siri and use the virtual assistant to let users shout out commands, request a ride from car-sharing service Lyft, and more. Apple's Siri integration is an important step in making the virtual assistant more appealing. Get It for the Smart Home For the first time, iOS 10 comes with an app called Home that allows users to control hundreds of smart home devices. Apple said at its iPhone 7 media briefing Sept. 7 that hundreds more devices would support Home in the coming months. Apple Music Is Far More Appealing Apple Music received a big overhaul in iOS 10. The streaming music service now makes it easier for users to find content and has simplified its design. Apple Music also comes with a smarter algorithm that can intelligently analyze a user's listening behavior and provide more relevant music recommendations through its "For You" page. Rich Notifications Are a Nice Upgrade Apple's notifications have received a much-needed overhaul with help from rich notifications. In iOS 10, when a user receives a link to a webpage, image or video, a preview of that content will be displayed in the notification, allowing the person to decide whether to click it or not. The rich notifications also mean users can respond to a message right within the notification rather than be forced to jump into another app. Apple Pay Goes to the Internet Apple Pay has come to Safari. In iOS 10, users can go to an e-retailer's website and make a purchase. If that e-retailer supports Apple Pay, it'll show that as an option. Owners of devices with Apple Pay set up can then make a purchase using Apple's proprietary platform rather than input credit card information. The Built-In Keyboard Is Getting Better Apple's built-in virtual keyboard now includes a contextual prediction engine. That engine is capable of analyzing what a person is typing, and based on earlier conversations and other contextual clues, provide better recommendations for what to type next. For instance, if a user types something similar to "I'm available at," the keyboard will display free times in Apple Calendar that can be tapped on and quickly added to an email, message or other correspondence. It's Free and It's Possible to Switch Back to iOS 9 There's little risk in downloading Apple's iOS 10. As long as users back up their data before deciding to download the software, they can update to iOS 10 at no charge and see if they like it. If they end up deciding that it has too many problems or just isn't right for them, they can go back to iOS 9 with a back-up. Granted, Apple doesn't make it so easy to back up to older iOS versions, but it is possible, and having that flexibility takes some of the risk out of downloading the new operating system.

Some early adopters were negatively affected by the update, which forced them to connect to iTunes in order to complete the upgrade and regain access to their devices. Although Apple quickly responded, saying it had fixed the problem, the early glitch has prompted some iPhone users to wonder if it's safe to download iOS 10 or if they should wait until Apple works all the bugs out of the download process.  In the corporate world, early adoption isn't necessarily a standard practice, and there's always a fear that things might go awry, causing a loss of time, money and productivity.  But with enhancements to iMessage, the ability for third-party developers to access Siri, in addition to a number of bug fixes, iOS 10 looks like a nice upgrade. So why wait. This eWEEK slide show covers some of the operating system's best features and why now is as good a time as any for iOS device users to download Apple's latest mobile platform.

(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) FILE - In this Monday, July 6, 2015, file photo, a man uses a mobile phone while walking by a building in the Financial District in New York. U.S. stocks are slightly higher in early trading Wednesday, Sept. 14, 2016, as utility companies climb. Energy companies are trading lower as the price of oil continues to slip. Stocks are at their lowest levels in two months after large losses in two of the previous three days. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (1) New York • U.S. stocks are making modest gains Wednesday as Apple leads technology companies higher. Energy companies are trading lower as the price of oil continues to slip. Stocks are fairly calm after three days of big, erratic moves, but bond yields are falling after a big increase a day earlier. KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average added 21 points, or 0.1 percent, to 18,087 as of 11:40 a.m. Mountain time. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 4 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,130. The Nasdaq composite climbed 27 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,182. Stocks are at their lowest levels in two months after big losses Friday and Tuesday. In between came a big gain on Monday. VIDEOS TOP JOBS WHERE TO? Investors have sent stocks in different directions as they wonder if the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next week, and they're also speculating about the health of the global economy. Bond prices also reflected that confusion as they changed direction once again, as yields fell and prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.69 percent. A day earlier it jumped to 1.73 percent, the highest in almost three months. The fall in bond yields helped high-dividend utility companies, which became more appealing to investors seeking income. Consolidated Edison added 91 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $74.14 and Sempra Energy gained $1.15, or 1.1 percent, to $103.68. PLANT A SEED: After four months of public negotiations, seed and weedkiller maker Monsanto agreed to be bought by German drug and farm chemical company Bayer. Bayer's latest offer is worth about $57 billion in cash. Bayer makes a wide range of crop protection chemicals that kill weeds, bugs and fungus, while Monsanto is known for its seeds business and the weedkiller Glyphosate. It rose $1.01, or 1 percent, to $107.11. TECH TIP TOP: Apple picked up $4.68, or 4.3 percent, to $112.63, for its second day of big gains. Apple rose Tuesday after T-Mobile said it's getting strong preorders for the new iPhones. Apple gets most of its revenue from the iPhone, and those sales, while still enormous, have finally started to decline in the last year. That's hurt Apple stock, which traded above $130 a little more than a year ago. Other gainers included customer-management software developer Salesforce.com, which added $1.22, or 1.7 percent, to $74.29. OIL: Benchmark New York crude lost 94 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $43.96 a barrel in New York. The international standard, Brent crude, fell 85 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $46.25 a barrel in London. U.S. crude prices fell 3 percent Tuesday and energy companies continued to fall Wednesday. Chevron gave up 36 cents to $99.07 and Murphy Oil lost $1.14, or 4.4 percent, to $25. NO FIESTA: Ford dipped 18 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $12.21 after it said its pretax profit will fall this year. Ford also said its results will weaken further in 2017 as the company invests more money in electric and autonomous cars, among other areas, and costs rise. The automaker expects results to start improving in 2018. LIVELY: Dermatology drug developer Vitae Pharmaceuticals soared to $20.86 after it agreed to be bought by Allergan, the maker of Botox. The deal values Vitae at $21 per share, or $606 million. Vitae, which doesn't have any approved products, closed at $8.10 on Tuesday. Allergan rose $6.13, or 2.6 percent, to $246.23. STEEL STAINED: Nucor stumbled after it forecast a smaller profit than investors expected for the third quarter. The steelmaker said it expects to earn between 85 cents and 95 cents a share, while FactSet said investors were expecting $1.03 per share on average. The stock declined 57 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $45.45. IN THE WEEDS: Cracker Barrel Old Country Store gave up $9.95, or 6.6 percent, to $140.58 after investors weren't impressed with the restaurant chain's projections for the current fiscal year. CURRENCIES: The dollar fell to 102.38 yen from 102.72 yen. The euro rose to $1.1259 from $1.1208. OVERSEAS: The CAC 40 in France fell 0.4 percent and Germany's DAX edged up 0.1 percent. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares rose 0.1 percent. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 lost 0.7 percent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng was down 0.1 percent. South Korean markets were closed for a national holiday.   Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY VIEW PHOTO GALLERY JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES It's not easy being black at BYU, film shows Utah lawmakers: Time to take 'training wheels' off booming solar industry, retire tax credit Women's basketball: Dangerfield scores 19 to lead No. 3 UConn over No. 2 Baylor Garrison Keillor: Politics is not everything.

The courage to move on, do something new, that betters all of us. And our team has tremendous courage.” Of course, Schiller’s remarks quickly became prime comedic fodder for folks on Twitter and Facebook who couldn’t help but laugh at what they viewed as a complete misuse of the word. DON’T MISS: The iPhone 7’s new home button lost a key feature, but there’s already a fix Indeed, if you do a Twitter search for #courage, you come across no shortage of tweets like these. Leaked image of iPhone 8, #Apple removes the screen, home button and camera. #courage pic.twitter.com/Va6XBGRrM9 — Kenney 🎮 (@KenneyNL) September 7, 2016 Here's some new Apple headphones that are more expensive, easier to lose and you need to charge them every few hours. #courage — Chris Megerian (@ChrisMegerian) September 7, 2016 Interestingly, Ben Lovejoy of 9to5Mac points out that Schiller’s use of the word “courage” was likely purposeful and could perhaps be a subtle shout out to Steve Jobs’ own views on “courage” which were made within the context of Apple’s decision not to support Flash on the iPhone. Jobs’ remarks on the topic, taken from his appearance at the D8 conference in 2010, read as follows: We’re trying to make great products for people, and we have at least the courage of our convictions to say we don’t think this is part of what makes a great product, we’re going to leave it out. Some people are going to not like that, they’re going to call us names […] but we’re going to take the heat because we want to make the best product in the world for customers. And we’re instead going to focus our energy on these technologies which we think are in their ascendancy and we think are going to be the right technologies for customers. And you know what? They’re paying us to make those choices. That’s what a lot of customers pay us to do, is to try and make the best products we can. And if we succeed, they’ll buy them, and if we don’t, they won’t, and it’ll all work itself out. So while it’s easy to scoff at Schiller’s use of the word “courage”, the word choice does seem more appropriate when viewed through the prism of Jobs’ aforementioned remarks. As Jobs lays out, if Apple’s decision with respect to the iPhone 7 headphone jack proves to be a disaster, people simply won’t buy the device. And if customers don’t care or are just as happy with Lightning headphones, then they will. Chiming in on the matter, John Gruber of Daring Fireball provides some interesting insight to the discussion. But Jobs and Schiller meant “courage” in the same way: having the courage to make a sure-to-be controversial decision when there is a non-controversial option, simply because they believe it to be the right thing to do in the long run. … We, as a species, are hooked up to focus on the short run, and we’re hooked up to seek popularity and avoid criticism. Choosing to do what you know will be unpopular in the short run but you believe will prove correct in the long run takes courage. Courage of one’s convictions, not courage running into a burning building to save a life, but courage nonetheless. Fair enough, but Apple had some clearly delineated reasons for steadfastly refusing to support mobile Flash. With respect to the iPhone 7 and it’s lack of a headphone jack, it’s not entirely clear that Apple laid out such a strong case.

Apple was up 1.6 percent, giving the three major indexes their biggest boost and rising for the third day in a row on reports of strong demand for the new iPhones. The technology sector was up 0.38 percent, one of the six gainers among the 10 major S&P 500 indexes. That was in sharp contrast to the declines in all sectors on Tuesday. U.S. stocks have swung wildly since Friday on contrasting comments from Federal Reserve officials on whether the central bank would raise interest rates at its Sept. 20-21 meeting. The benchmark S&P 500 index fell 1.4 percent on Tuesday after having gained by a similar measure on Monday. The index had fallen 2.45 percent on Friday. "The market is preparing for the worst, which is a rate hike in the U.S., and hoping for the best," said Andre Bakhos, managing director at Janlyn Capital in Bernardsville, New Jersey. "That mindset is causing back and forth swings in the past few days." At 9:57 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 12.95 points, or 0.07 percent, at 18,079.7. The S&P 500 index was up 2.17 points, or 0.1 percent, at 2,129.19. The Nasdaq Composite was up 15.14 points, or 0.29 percent, at 5,170.39. The CBOE Market Volatility index, known as Wall Street's fear gauge, has also spiked and dropped with the stock market's gyrations. The index was down 2 percent on Wednesday. "There are also opportunistic traders out there, short-covering and bargain hunting with the mindset to trade shorter-term and that's what is causing those sharp moves," Bakhos said. Oil prices fell 1.15 percent, sending the S&P energy index down 0.27 percent. Monsanto rose 0.7 percent to $106.89 after Bayer agreed to buy the seed maker for $66 billion. Vitae Pharmaceuticals shares doubled to $20.84 after Allergan said it would buy the company for $639 million. Allergan rose 1.4 percent. Sarepta surged 20 percent to $30.70 after Oppenheimer said a key critic of company's muscle disorder drug has left the FDA. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,475 to 1,218. On the Nasdaq, 1,221 issues fell and 1,131 advanced. The S&P 500 index showed no new 52-week highs and three new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 13 new highs and 23 new lows.

DJIA S&P 500 NASDAQ Markets Today Ireland Not Happy About EU's Apple Attack But Don't Expect 'Irexit' The European Commission is out-of-bounds in demanding Apple pay a massive back-tax bill due to its Irish operations, but don't expect the rift to cause Ireland to exit the Eurozone. Gregg Greenberg Sep 14, 2016 1:22 PM EDT The European Commission is out of bounds in demanding Apple (AAPL) pay a massive back tax bill due to its Irish operations, but don't expect the rift to cause Ireland to exit the Eurozone over it, said Martin Shanahan, CEO of IDA Ireland. 'We do not believe this money is owed to Ireland,' said Shanahan. 'Our revenue services said very clearly that all taxes due to be collected from Apple have been collected for the period of time in question.' Apple was ordered to pay €13 billion ($14.5 billion) in back taxes to Ireland under a European Commission ruling last month. Both Apple and Ireland are appealing the decision in a process that Apple warned could take several years but with no impact on its cash balance or future tax rate. Apple has operated continuously in Cork since 1980 and today they employ nearly 6,000 people across Ireland. Amid a wider crackdown against corporate tax avoidance in the 28-nation bloc, the EC said that 'undue benefits' granted to Apple amounted to illegal state subsidies, and will need to be recovered. EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager insisted that the €13 billion is not a penalty, but unpaid taxes to be paid, and has to do with Apple's profits generated in Europe and recorded in Europe, adding that it is now up to Ireland to recover the amount. Vestager also hinted that Apple could potentially be on the hook for further taxes in other jurisdictions, saying that governments in the EU and elsewhere could look to the latest decision and the yet-to-be-published reasoning to determine whether to require Apple to pay additional taxes. But she said any back taxes due elsewhere could theoretically reduce the Irish tax bill if related profits should have been booked in other jurisdictions. The Commission has acknowledged that the decision does not call into question Ireland's general tax system or its corporate tax rate. 'Ireland has one of the most transparent and consistent and competitive tax systems in the world and we are unapologetic about the fact that we are competitive,' said Shanahan. 'We have a pro-business environment and we believe we need a pro-business environment to win investment.' Despite the back and forth, Shanahan does not believe the rift will cause Ireland to break from the European Union as Great Britain voted to do earlier this year. 'We fundamentally disagree with the European Commission on this issue but we are committed to Europe and the European project,' said Shanahan.

His suspension began yesterday. Prasit arranged an urgent press conference to respond to the move, saying he would file a petition against the Securities and Exchange Commission and was ready to appeal to the highest court for justice.  According to the SEC’s release circulated on Tuesday, the regulator found after a routine examination that Prasit had failed to supervise his company’s working system for customers according to the “know your customer”, “customer due diligence” and “suspicious transaction reporting” requirements.  The SEC said it would submit this case to its Settlement Committee for further consideration.  Apple Wealth Securities’ working system for customers was also inefficient in letting the company know who were the real customers or real beneficiaries of the customers, the SEC said.  The company might be at risk of becoming an accomplice if the customers did anything illegal. The SEC said Prasit failed to supervise by approving a number of new stock accounts and increasing the credit line for stock trading for many customers even though some of them had submitted incomplete documents, significantly understating the size of their transactions.  As chairman of Apple Wealth Securities’ anti-laundering committee, Prasit took no further action when he found the unusual transactions, the SEC said. However, Prasit insisted that his management actions were supervised by a system and complied with standards and good corporate governance. He has been gathering evidence and other documents in preparation for the planned petition under the Administrative Procedure Act of 1996.  He said he would call for justice and protection of his dignity, as he had always worked with integrity and good corporate governance. Apple Wealth Securities is run according to the standards required by the regulators and the Association of Thai Securities Companies, and driven by specific policies, not an individual, he said. “Throughout the 15 years I’ve worked in the securities industry, I have never caused any damage to a customer. And when there were suggestions from the SEC, on all issues, I’ve proceeded with them instantly,” |he said. Regarding his alleged negligence in overseeing the “know your customer” system and approval of improper credit lines, Prasit expressed confidence that he had worked according to the system and regulations required by the company, and based on the regulators and the association. “On some matters, I’ve worked above the association’s standards. My work has not brought damage to the company and customers.  “I’ve moved up as I’ve used integrity to lead me in the securities industry.  “In the securities industry, integrity can make money. Money alone cannot make money. This is what I’ve always done,” he said.   Tags SEC Most Viewed TODAY LAST 7 Days LAST 30 Days Shopping portal a win-win for car buyers and dealers...

When it comes to map apps, consumers are finding plenty of fresh paths to digital navigation thanks to Google, Apple and many rivals. Here WeGo, Waze, MapFactor, Mapquest, Scout GPS, Maps.Me and InRoute are just some of the apps that are challenging Google Maps and Apple Maps, which dominate smartphone mapping services, by focusing on new and novel features. Google and Apple, though, aren’t content to stay in the slow lane of innovation. Both have added new features to their map apps in recent months, including enabling users to add interim destinations to go along with the ultimate stop on a trip. Google’s changes rolled out in an update to Google Maps this summer; Apple’s changes will be included in iOS 10, the soon-to-be released next version of its mobile operating system. “Just open the app, enter a destination, tap the corner menu, and then click add a stop,” Google says in a blog post. “To rearrange the order of your stops, tap and hold the three-dot menu to the left of Add Stop and drag it to the position you want.” The Apple Maps service has new features that seek to meld activities and services associated with a trip. “Apps like OpenTable can integrate bookings right into Maps,” Apple says on its website. “Services like Uber and Lyft can make it easier for users to book a ride, without ever leaving the Maps app.” And while this navigational arms race shifts into high gear, it’s become apparent the original stand-alone GPS devices are becoming stranded by the side of the road. The proliferation of smartphone apps has reshaped a market once dominated by the stand-alone machines, such as TomTom, Garmin and Magellan. According to market research firm Berg Insight, worldwide shipments of personal navigation devices has decreased from 40 million units in 2008 to a projected 11 million by the end of this year. That number is expected to drop to just 7 million in 2019 – less than a tenth of projected smartphone map app users in that year. “Most consumers are using their smartphones as their primary navigation and map system,” said Ben Bajarin, an analyst with Creative Strategies, a market researcher. “Retailers, in a lot of cases, don’t really promote the stand-alone devices any more.” The established map apps from Google and Apple offer a wide array of features, with the centerpiece being turn-by-turn navigation. And while the emerging apps also typically offer turn-based directions, they all attempt to offer niche features that also can go beyond the basics of the apps from the tech titans. Google-owned Waze, whose service is separate from Google Maps, emphasizes the social aspects of traveling, and its new features include improved ways to share your estimated time of arrival with others. It also provides quick access to frequent destinations. “You can use Waze to find out about lots of things,” Bajarin said. “It pops up icons to tell you about traffic, police in your area, gives you suggestions on alternate routes. It’s the integration of social media with navigation.” Other apps also seek to meld the drive with other services. Scout GPS emphasizes social interaction, including the ability to message friends and family and share your location or destination with designated people. Here WeGo allows you to summon taxicabs or access a ride-hailing service. And some apps focus on improving the driving experience. Mapquest, one of the first computer-based navigation guides, recently began allowing drivers to see speed limits on the street they’re traveling. Maps.Me has added navigation elements that take up less space on the screen, and the speed the vehicle is traveling has been added. InRoute, designed mainly for long road trips, offers the ability to add numerous stops – and drivers can easily select routes that avoid areas with hot temperatures or hilly terrain. Saying it makes “cities easier to use,” Citymapper is geared to the daily commuter. In addition to vehicle navigation, the app has found a way to coordinate public transit and ride-hailing services so people can plan integrated trips. Citymapper’s service can be especially handy in big cities with major transit networks, said Michael Tchong, founder of Las Vegas-based Ubercool Innovation, which tracks technology trends. “The wave of the future is Citymapper,” Tchong said. “It integrates vehicle navigation, buses, subways, trains, Uber, Lyft all in one package. It will tell you whether the train you are on is running on time.” Experts predict the pace of innovation will pick up even more for map apps. “The map apps could become automated and start working as soon as you turn on your phone,” said Rob Enderle, an Oregon-based analyst who tracks the tech sector. “That way, if you’re driving, you don’t have to juggle a bunch of apps.” And map apps also may become more closely attuned to their users. They might start taking note of what types of restaurants you visit and only suggest those when you’re looking for a place to eat, Bajarin said. “The unique personalization of mapping is the next step,” he said. “We are on that cusp.” The big two The two big map apps for the major phone platforms are the widely used Google Maps for Android and iPhone and Apple Maps for the iPhone. GOOGLE MAPS What’s new: The ability to add interim stops to a destination, as well as estimates for how much time the detour will add to the trip. APPLE MAPS What’s new: Apple upgrades, include an interim stops feature; users who want a reminder of where they parked their car can use a pin drop as a target. The challengers Here are some free map apps that attempt to challenge, or at least seek to address some shortcomings of, the two primary programs from Google and Apple. WAZE What’s new: A cleaner and fresh look, with quick access to frequent destinations; a new way to share your ETA with others. MAPQUEST What’s new: Users can get speed limits to appear on their screens, including if you’re in a school zone. The route ahead is shown in what is called “2.5D” which Mapquest calls the “Perspective View.” Distance to a location now automatically updates. Here WEGO What’s new: Now easier to pick a destination and scroll to the mode of transportation. The app also offers ride-booking company Car2Go, as well as info on taxi services. MAPFACTOR What’s new: Better alternative route calculation; improved Google searches; the icon highlights when searching for a point of interest. SCOUT GPS What’s new: Although turn-by-turn navigation is available, the app focuses on social interactions. Among the new features: You can send messages to friends and family; drive to the location of friends and family; share your location, route and real-time ETA; and ask a friend to pick you up. MAPS.ME What’s new: The navigation elements take up less space; speed is now displayed; and an autozoom element has been added; bicycle riders can see terrain data; search results show hotel ratings and prices. INROUTE What’s new: Custom routes that let people avoid the heat on a summer road trip, or for those towing a trailer, ways to avoid steep hills; users can also chose routes with a lot of curves. CITYMAPPER What’s new: Travelers can get alerts about disruptions on transit systems in a city.

Tim Cook just teased Apple's VR headset plans – or is that actually AR? by Chris Smith 14 September 2016 0 shares Read Comments Apple CEO Tim Cook has expressed a preference for augmented reality experiences over their VR counterparts, perhaps offering insight into Apple’s future plans. In an interview on Good Morning America, Cook said there’s greater potential in AR because it doesn’t require users to shut themselves off from other people. He said: "My own view is that augmented reality is the larger of the two, probably by far, because this gives the capability for both of us to sit and be very present talking to each other, but also have other things visually for both of us to see. "Maybe it's something we're talking about, maybe it's someone else here that is not here, present, but could be made to appear to be present with us. So there's a lot of really cool things there." Related: Oculus Rift vs HTC Vive - Which should you buy? Cook also said virtual reality will have “a lower commercial interest over time,” which is a pretty solid indicator that Apple's entry into the market might be more Microsoft HoloLens than Oculus Rift. "Less people will be interested in that [VR], but there are some really cool areas there for education and gaming that we have a lot of interest in," Cook added. Recent reports have suggested Apple is experimenting with both VR and AR hardware and software experiences. An FT report claimed the company has build a secret team of hundreds of employees, many poached from top players in the sector. in recent years, the company has also made a number of VR patents and acquired start ups like Flyby Media, PrimeSense, Metaio and Faceshift.

		     Privacy Policy Thank you Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. More like this Trusting the Social Security Administration? Perfect Forward Secrecy can block the NSA from secure web pages, but no one... The Social Security website is now secure Video IT security: 3 things you need to know now Consider this scenario: Someone logs on to amazon.com using password xyz123. Then, they logon to gmail, where their password is also xyz123. Then, they logon to Facebook, where, yet again, their password is xyz123. In this day and age, who would do such an obviously insecure thing as re-using the same password over and over again? Apple. Yes, that Apple, the richest company in the world. The company famous for fighting the FBI over an iPhone password. Let me explain. The home page of Apple.com My last blog noted that the US Social Security Administration did a great job configuring the security for www.ssa.gov, yet the security for the secure.ssa.gov section of their site was poor. Considering the "secure" section is where you login, this could be taken as proof the government learned nothing from the Office of Personnel Management hack. A recent iToy purchase prompted the same sort of security evaluation for Apple's website. As before, I used the excellent SSL Server Test from SSL Labs/Qualys.  The main Apple website, like most every site, can be addressed as either apple.com or www.apple.com. With three Ws, the site gets a B rating from SSL Labs. It's one failing: "This server accepts RC4 cipher, but only with older protocol versions." Without the leading Ws, the site gets an A minus. This time, the lone failing is different: "The server does not support Forward Secrecy with the reference browsers."  Its not clear to me that any confidential information is entered on the website using either apple.com or www.apple.com so these are probably minor issues.  Let me back up here to note that it is perfectly normal for different sections of a website to have different security profiles. The sections are denoted by subdomains which appear to left of the main domain name. For example, the main apple domain is apple.com and "www" is a subdomain. Two other Apple subdomains are support.apple.com and iforgot.apple.com. In the case of the Social Security Administration, the main domain name is ssa.gov and two of their subdomains are secure.ssa.gov and faq.ssa.gov. While buying an iDevice, account information is entered at secure2.store.apple.com which gets an A plus rating from SSL Labs - not a single security issue.  Support.apple.com gets an A minus, due to two security flaws: "Intermediate certificate has a weak signature" and "There is no support for secure renegotiation." But here too, this subdomain does not seem to be used for transferring sensitive information. The same can not be said of getsupport.apple.com. This part of the website is where Apple customers enter their personal information so that they can connect with technical support. The personal information can be the customer name, email address and phone number. According to SSL Labs, this section of the site has a single security failing: "There is no support for secure renegotiation." A COMMON FLAW The real trouble, as I see it, is in the sections of the website that deal with an Apple ID and password. SSL Labs report on iforgot.apple.com For example, customers wanting to reset either their password or their security questions are directed to iforgot.apple.com. This section gets an A minus (see report above) with two errors: "Intermediate certificate has a weak signature" and "The server does not support Forward Secrecy with the reference browsers." The Apple ID account page Forward secrecy is again an issue at the Apple ID account page (appleid.apple.com) where customers can create, reset or change their Apple ID. Another section of the website where users logon with their Apple ID and password is idmsa.apple.com. It too, does not support Forward Secrecy. SSL Labs report on www.icloud.com Neither does www.icloud.com, the report is shown above. I am no expert regarding Apple's website, but it seems that every section where a customer enters their Apple ID and password fails to implement Forward Secrecy. This despite, as the other examples showed, Apple using Forward Secrecy elsewhere. WHY YOU SHOULD CARE Forward secrecy (a.k.a. Perfect Forward Secrecy, PFS and just plain FS) is a rather obscure SSL/TLS option and SSL/TLS is the protocol that makes secure web pages secure.  Back in 2013, when I first wrote about it, you had to be quite a nerd to determine if a connection to a secure website was using Perfect Forward Secrecy (if the key exchange is ECDHE_RSA or DHE_RSA then it is). Even now, some online SSL testers (here, here and here) don't report on Forward Secrecy. SSL Labs offers the most in-depth report, showing the status of Forward Secrecy with a large range of client software. Both High-Tech Bridge and Netcraft report on it, but with a simple ON/OFF. While the details of Forward Secrecy are complicated (and over my head) the basic concept is simple. Without it, a website uses the same encryption password (the official term is a "key" but it functions much like a password) over and over and over. Day after day, for a year or two. Thus, the example at the top of this blog.  With Forward Secrecy, every connection to a secure website uses a different encryption key/password. If a company really cares about security, they use Forward Secrecy. It's not a headline grabbing thing, but many sites use it. Google started using it back in November of 2011 writing at the time "We would very much like to see forward secrecy become the norm..." And, as noted earlier, Apple uses it for their online store. Without Forward Secrecy, theft or loss of the single password/key lets an attacker decrypt all the prior web pages. Of course, the attacker would have to have been recording those secure web pages, but, spy agencies do so.  Here's the guts of the issue. Without Perfect Forward Secrecy, Apple only needs to turn over one password/key to the US government to enable the decryption of all Apple IDs and passwords entered on apple.com and icloud.com. The key is just a string of ones and zeros and would probably fit on an index card.   With Forward Secrecy, there is no one single password/key. Secure web pages, even those recorded by a spy agency tapped into the Internet backbond, would remain secure, going forward in time, even if the main password/key was leaked or stolen. The term Forward Secrecy refers to whether something that is a secret now, will remain a secret going forward in time even if the main key is compromised.  For more on Forward Secrecy see these articles from Qualys, Netcraft, The Register and CNet. All were written in the summer of 2013, shortly after Edward Snowden helped reveal that spy agencies were indeed recording some/much/most Internet traffic. RTFM As for Apple documentation, their iCloud security and privacy overview (Last Modified: May 13, 2016) mentions the transmission of passwords a couple times. In one place it says that an iCloud username and password is "sent over an encrypted SSL connection" - no doubt relying on the reader to incorrectly assume that all encrypted SSL (it is really TLS) connections are the same. Elsewhere, it says that keychain data is transmitted with 256-bit AES encryption. What it does not say, is anything about Forward Secrecy, which blows a hole in the cryptography. In effect, the article is bragging about the lock on the front door while leaving out the fact that the key is under the doormat. Penn and Teller would be proud, this type of mis-direction is what magicians depend on.  WTF Why does Apple disable Forward Secrecy when customers enter their Apple ID and password? Like death and taxes, you can be sure they won't say. - - - - - - -  Update: September 14, 2016.  How obscure is Perfect Forward Secrecy? The specs for TLS version 1.2, the latest and most secure SSL/TLS protocol, are 100 pages long and mention it only in passing. Here is the first mention ... a compromise of the server's static RSA key results in a loss of confidentiality for all sessions protected under that static key. TLS users desiring Perfect Forward Secrecy should use DHE cipher suites. and here is the second ... using a fresh key for each handshake provides Perfect Forward Secrecy. Implementations SHOULD generate a new X for each handshake when using DHE cipher suites.  To express your thoughts on Computerworld content, visit Computerworld's Facebook page, LinkedIn page and Twitter stream.

Apple’s new AirPods are sleek, discreet, and still allow you to speak on the phone hands- and cord-free. No more tangled wires jumbled at the bottom of your purse, or dangling awkwardly from your neck, distracting from what could otherwise be a chic piece of tech perched atop your head. But there are many other options out there. The new Bluetooth headphones from i.am+ EPs come with a rose-gold finish, perfect for blending in seamlessly with light hair and making it look like you’re practically wearing no earbuds at all. And for those who prefer to make a statement, look no further than the Beats Unity Edition wireless headphones featuring country-inspired designs in a colorful array of patriotic options. The gold Samsung on-ear headphones promise to look as chic on as they will dangling casually around your neck.

Posted 14 Sep 2016 21:40 Updated 15 Sep 2016 04:35 Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., September 13, 2016. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS: Wall Street edged lower on Wednesday as investors stewed about future interest rate hikes and cheaper oil dragged down energy shares, although Apple surged to its highest level this year. Speculation about the timing of the Federal Reserve's next interest rate hike has shaken major stock indexes following contrasting comments from Fed officials. The S&P 500 remains down almost 3 percent from before a steep selloff on Friday, even though interest rate futures indicate expectations for a rate hike at the Fed's Sept. 20-21 meeting are still low. "What you're seeing is a little preview for what will happen when the Fed does raise rates," said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Cornerstone Financial Partners. "People are starting to make changes to their portfolios." Apple jumped 3.6 percent and briefly touched a 2016 high, with its market capitalization topping US$600 billion for the first time since April, as Wall Street bet the technology company's newest iPhone would help shore up falling sales. Its rally helped push the S&P 500 technology index up 0.58 percent, making it the session's strongest sector. Oil prices dropped 2 percent following data that showed large weekly builds in U.S. petroleum products, sending the S&P energy index down 1.15 percent. Exxon Mobil declined 0.72 percent, the heaviest drag on the S&P 500. After spending much of the day with gains, the Dow Jones industrial average ended down 0.18 percent at 18,034.77 points and the S&P 500 gave up 0.06 percent to 2,125.77. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.36 percent to 5,173.77. Monsanto agreed to be bought by Bayer , but its stock rose just 0.62 percent to US$106.76, well below the offer of US$128 per share, due to concerns about regulatory approvals. Vitae Pharmaceuticals shares more than doubled to US$20.85 after Allergan said it would buy the company for US$639 million. Allergan rose 1.78 percent. Ford fell 1.94 percent after the automaker said 2017 financial performance would decline from this year's levels. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.11-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.03-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 1 new 52-week high and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 45 new highs and 41 new lows. About 7.0 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, above the 6.5 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data.

A significant number of iPhone and iPad owners complained their devices were "bricked" by the update, an issue Apple says is now fixed. Wow. iPad pro update failed. I don't even know if I have iTunes or a free USB port! U: Have to do clean install wtf pic.twitter.com/zwjM5U2WqC— Seth Weintraub (@llsethj) September 13, 2016 Apple announced iOS 10 back in June. It publicly released the update yesterday, making it available to owners of all supported devices. Not long after the launch went live, users began to complain of problems with the software. Shortly after the release, Twitter was awash with claims that attempting to install iOS 10 was leaving products bricked and unusable. Affected phones and tablets can be recovered using iTunes on a PC or Mac. It's not an especially user-friendly procedure though. Users may experience further issues or lose their data. As increasing numbers of people fell victim to the bug, Apple contacted various news outlets and confirmed it had experienced a "brief issue" with the iOS 10 rollout. It said the problem has since been remedied, advising affected users to open iTunes to restore their device. "We experienced a brief issue with the software update process, affecting a small number of users during the first hour of availability," Apple's statement read. "The problem was quickly resolved and we apologize to those customers. Anyone who was affected should connect to iTunes to complete the update or contact AppleCare for help." Customers who encountered the problem reported seeing a black screen after the OTA update to iOS 10 began. After a few minutes, the ominous "Connect to iTunes" warning would appear, indicating the device failed to install the update and could no longer startup. 9to5Mac suggested the issue may have been caused by the iOS 10 versions delivered to users. The devices initially download iOS 10.0.0 from Apple's servers and then attempt to update to iOS 10.0.1, potentially triggering the failure. iOS 10 is a substantial upgrade to Apple's mobile platform. It includes an improved version of Siri, a redesigned lock screen and overhauled notifications. Apple's 3D Touch pressure-sensitive display is now present in more places throughout the core interface, letting key controls distinguish between taps and presses. Official press images of Apple's iOS 10, announced 13/06/2016 Apple Apple's stock apps have also received attention. Apple Music and Apple News have both undergone complete rebuilds, including new interfaces that are supposed to be simpler and easier to use. Apple Music in particular had been criticised by customers for its poorly designed menus and playback controls. Similarly, Apple Maps has been revised with an "intelligent" interface and support for automatic directions. Messages has been extensively reworked. It now features animated and personalised emoji, akin to those found in Facebook Messenger and other online services. The major improvements are joined by a series of smaller ones throughout the OS, including the ability to remove unused stock apps from the home screen. iOS 10 should be available to download now. According to Apple, all supported devices can now install it without experiencing any problems. The list of officially compatible devices includes the iPhone 5 and later, all iPad Air and iPad Pro models, the 4th generation iPad, the iPad Mini 2 and the iPod Touch 6th generation. Apple advised any customers who are still encountering problems to use iTunes to complete the update or contact AppleCare support.

Now there are rumors that Samsung's next-gen Galaxy S8 smartphone will also not have a headphone jack, and that's not good.     Digital Music News says it has a source in South Korea that is in "the broader supply chain of Samsung's smartphones" that the new Galaxy S8 smartphone could have its own proprietary connector, just like the iPhone, moving away from microUSB and USB Type-C connectors on the Galaxy S7, and Galaxy Note 7 smartphones.   Samsung's new connector would be incompatible with the Lightning ports on the iPhone, so there would be a proprietary connector that will annoy countless people. The stretch for profits goes wide and far, it is the courage that drives these companies to release some of the most popular products in the world without the standard we have on millions of devices - all without a clear benefit of what a proprietary connector provides, over the convenience of a 3.5mm jack.

Horse-drawn wagon rides around the grounds of the Vicksburg Historic Village are among the attractions of the annual Vicksburg Harvest Festival.Tom Haroldson | Special to the Kalamazoo Gazette  The 38th annual Bangor Apple Festival from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Saturday comes nearly a month after the Aug. 20 tornado that tore through the town, one of several to hit West Michigan that day. Among the activities will be at car show, motorcycle show, magician John Dudley, arts and crafts, a beer tent, Jared Knox & the Hager Bombs, a free showing of the movie "Angry Birds" for kids at dark outdoors next to Roma's Pizza, the Bangor Friends of the Library book sale, kids activities such as bobbing for apples and pictures, ponies and popcorn. For details, go to http://www.bangorapplefestival.com. In Gobles, it has become a tradition for Harvest Moon Acres on M-40 to welcome fall with family-friendly attractions in a festival-like atmosphere, and this year is no different with the kick off of the 2016 season rolling on Saturday, Sept. 17. Look for attractions that include Harvest Moon pumpkin slingshots, a 40-foot bale slide, kid-sized zip-lines, life-sized barnyard board game, a 5-acre corn maze and hayrides through the 65-acre grounds. Owners Barry and Cindy Broekhuizen say they are also excited about expansions this year, including farm-fresh donuts in their new building. Hours are 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Saturdays and 1 to 6 p.m. Sundays through Oct. 30, with flashlight nights every October Saturday night this season. For details, go to www.harvestmoonfun.com.

Most Popular Chris Clarke By Chris Clarke Sep 14, 2016 The new iPhone 7 is packed with great tech and a fancy new shell. It's the best iPhone ever, Apple CEO Tim Cook said on stage earlier this month. And not for the first time. Apple says that about every new iPhone. Given the inexorable march of technology, it's probably true. But my favorite iPhone is not the best iPhone ever. It is nine years old. A fully functional original—no bloody 3G, 3GS, 4, 4S 5, 5S, 6, 6S, or 7. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below I'll admit I was among the skeptics back in 2007 when Apple first announced it would be selling a phone. But somehow, swept up like so many others, I found myself a proud owner of that very first iPhone, which lives alongside my working models of nearly every mobile device Apple has ever made, an ever-growing collection. That first one, though. I can't imagine my life without it. Steve Jobs with the original iPhone in 2007. Splash Remember the chatter back then? "Why would you want to make a phone call on your iPod?" "How will you protect the screen if you can't flip it shut?" "You want me to type on that tiny touchscreen keyboard?" After all, in the good old days cell phones were still simply that. You could call or you could text, but unless you were rocking a Blackberry (hello there, high-powered business person!) there wasn't much else you could do with the thing. The first iPhone would begin the shift from mobile telephone to pocket supercomputer. Most Popular Not that I was thinking about any of that at the time. I wasn't one of those guys who waited in line outside the Cingular store to get my grubby fanboy hands on this hot gadget. I left that up to my buddy at work, the kind of nerd happy to pitch a tent on the sidewalk to snag a brand spanking new iPhone. I was a cord-cutter back before there was a name for us. I put XBMC on an actual Xbox, I ripped all my DVD's and torrented like it was going out of style. Why spend money when you could, you know, not? I loved my monthly T-mobile plan, and as much as I would have loved to try the new touchscreen Apple phone, the first iPhone required a minimum $499 cash plus a two-year contract with a hefty cancellation fee, a sign of things to come. I was not going to sign a contract that would lock me into two years of cell phone purgatory. From 2007 until 2011, Steve Jobs continued his exclusive service agreement with AT&T (or Cingular, as it was at the time). This meant, to use an iPhone outside the AT&T network, you had to get your device "unlocked." Back then, there was no officially-supported method for pulling that off. Even if you paid out your contract and owned the device outright, AT&T and Apple made no provisions to open the phone to work on other networks. So I kept my ear to the ground and followed the jailbreak community, the hardworking hackers devoted to ripping open the iPhone's software just because it was closed. It didn't take long for them to tear themselves an opening and do some sort of black magic to make the iPhone do their bidding, to free and then recapture its soul. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Once my buddy heard the announcement for the new iPhone 3G— "the best iPhone yet" coincidentally enough—he happily offloaded his first-generation classic for a small fee. So I began my collection of iPhones. I quickly learned the process for jailbreaking and unlocking that very first iPhone, which was not for the faint of heart. Back then, many an ambitious jailbreaker would wind up with a phone as useful as a brick, and worse, a voided the warranty. I was just lucky enough to make it through unscathed. My collection of iPhones Chris Clarke By the time I was through with it, my new iPhone was a lot different than its locked-up brethren. Remember, the first iPhone shipped without a little thing called the App Store. "Apps" as we know them today were still a twinkle in Steve Jobs' eye, and applications still lived on installation CDs—don't lose that jewel case with the serial number stamped inside! Technically iOS didn't even exist on the first iteration of iPhone. The operating system was instead billed as a version of OSX, the OS that runs on Macs. Nearly a year later it was redubbed iPhone OS, when Apple released the software development kit (SDK) to the public. It wouldn't be until 2010, with the release of the iPad, that Apple would adopt the now familiar term "iOS." What do you do without an app store? Use Safari. A lot. To be fair, a full-fledged mobile browser was quite the revolution in 2007. But beyond that, there was very little else. According to Jobs, Safari was the future of apps. In this alternate future, third-party developers would go on to use the Safari engine to create Web 2.0 applications that could be accessed from the Internet. And they did at first, but mobile data bandwidth and data rate pricing in 2008 made web-based apps a nightmare, and so native apps were born. With an SDK in place, a legion of anxious software developers, guidelines in place, and an iPhone starving for software, it's no wonder the apps came. And kept coming, in a wave that hasn't let up since. Chris Clarke It was around that time I began to develop and test apps as part of my nine-to-five. That job entailed checking for bugs on as many different devices as possible, from the iPhone's earliest iterations to the "best iPhone ever" of the day. So when I inherited my same friend's iPhone 3G, but kept my original iPhone for testing purposes. Over the next few years I began to collect a growing number of devices to keep it company. Soon the 3G was put on the shelf beside "the original," then the 3GS, 4, 4S, 5S, and 6. I also began collecting iPads after the first one was released in 2010. I still have my original iPad, along with an iPad 2, iPad 3, iPad Mini, iPad Air, and an iPad Pro all scattered somewhere around my desk. At first, keeping these devices around was an invaluable way to ensure my projects were in top-notch working condition across devices. Later, as technology progressed, they became less of a necessity and more of a accidental museum. A reminder of how we got here. My original iPhone is still trucking. It might not have taptic feedback or a retina display, but it still makes great phone calls, delivers text messages, and can even send the occasional tweet. And forget "jet black" or whatever glossy rose gold abomination they come up with next; the styling of the first iPhone is still my favorite. Its shape, size and color are timeless. I would gladly fork over money to have the guts of iPhone 7 packed neatly inside the form factor of the iPhone. So when that time of year rolls around and the Apple marketing machine touts the next greatest iPhone, I always pull out the original, power it up, and think to myself, nah. This will always be the greatest iPhone ever.

Stick It In (or On) Your Ear Analyst Says iPhone SE Was a One-Off for Apple View All Editorials → Understanding ‘Press Home to Open’ and ‘Press Home to Unlock’ in iOS 10 Jim Tanous @MGGJim · +Jim Tanous Sep 14th, 2016 11:55 AM EST | Quick Tip When Apple introduced the second-generation TouchID sensor in the iPhone 6s, users were quick to notice how much faster it was at recognizing fingerprints than its predecessor. This meant that users could unlock their iPhones and access their data faster than ever, but it introduced an interesting new problem: TouchID worked so quickly that users didn’t have an opportunity to see their pending notifications before being dropped at the home screen. Even a casual graze of thumb or finger over the home button could trigger the iPhone to unlock. To address this issue, Apple has changed how iOS devices are unlocked in iOS 10. Gone is the famous “slide to unlock” and in comes the new “raise to wake,” which coordinates with TouchID. While you can still press the home or lock buttons to wake your device, the iPhone will now “wake” to the lock screen when you raise it. From here, resting your thumb or finger on the home button unlocks the device but does not open it, instead leaving the user at the lock screen. This gives the user the opportunity to review any notifications. To access the home screen, or open the last running app, the user must press the home button. This new unlock/open system is a welcomed change for many, but some users may prefer the previous method of unlocking and opening the device immediately after using TouchID. Thankfully, Apple allows users to switch back to the old method via an option in the iOS Settings. Here’s how to find it. From your TouchID-enabled iPhone or iPad, head to Settings > General > Accessibility > Home Button. There, find the option labeled Rest Finger to Open. With Rest Finger to Open disabled (the default configuration in iOS 10), touching the home button with your finger will unlock your device but leave you at your lock screen. Enabling the option will automatically unlock and open the device when your finger touches the home button, taking you to the home screen or your last open app and effectively reverting the way that TouchID functions to pre-iOS 10.

I noticed this immediately after downloading iOS 10, and after confirming this was what was happening unearthed the former setting in preferences. I was actually going to comment on this on any iOS relevant post here on TMO. This was not the only setting that changed. At least on my 6s Plus, the Mail setting changed to putting the latest entry in a discussion thread at the bottom, instead of at the top, causing me some momentary confusion. Again, one can re-select ‘Most Recent Message on Top’ in Preferences under Mail. I had to do the same for my iPad Pro 9.7″. Apart from this, iOS loaded without a hitch and has been running just fine on my devices. September 14, 2016 at 12:08 EST PM JBSlough September 14, 2016 On an iPad that doesn’t have Touch ID the SmartCover no longer unlocks it (bring you to the Passcode Keypad if enabled). Kinda kills the Smart in the SmartCover. September 14, 2016 at 1:26 EST PM geoduck September 14, 2016 It’s taken a bit of getting used to but I’m starting to really like iOS10. The little things like raise to wake have improved how efficiantly I work with my SE. I already modified my lock screen so mail and Messages show up along with a calculator. All morning I just feel the buzz, pull the phone, check the screen and put it away. Need to figure something, pull it out, done. I’ve unlocked the phone less than half as often as I usually do. Much smoother. September 14, 2016 at 1:28 EST PM JustCause September 14, 2016 iPhone 5 runs faster than my iPhone 6 Plus….

I’m not sure why Apple removed it. September 15, 2016 at 12:27 EST AM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

What we aren’t getting is single sign-on support—a feature promised earlier this year at Apple’s annual developer conference. tvOS 10 for Apple TV got several new features, but single sign-on is still missing Single sign-on lets you use your cable subscription login to automatically sign in to TV channel apps instead of manually entering your user name and password for each. The feature was met with applause when it was announced, but for now we’ll have to keep waiting. Single sign-on is still on the feature list, so it’ll come with a future update. Until then, we’ll have to make due with Siri support in third-party apps, multiple elements in Siri searches, Siri control for HomeKit, Memories groupings in Photos, and an improved Music interface. tvOS 10 requires a fourth generation Apple TV. You can install the update by going to Settings > System > Software Updates > Update Software. Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Reddit Tags: Apple TV, single sign-on, tvOS, update One Comment Add a comment idarrin September 14, 2016 The other thing that is missing, and has been missing from launch, is to be able to use Siri to search for movies and TV shows under computers.

Toggle Navigation A-   A+ Sign in News   Stock Home «Back Google, Apple lock horns with govt over Aadhaar Bloomberg |  Sep 15, 2016 12:58 AM IST Wikimedia Commons India's relationship with the global technology industry has become increasingly fraught. This year alone, the government has banned Facebook's free web service and declined to exempt Apple from local sourcing rules and open its own stores. Now, the government could force companies to use technology cooked up in a government-funded lab. The initiative is part of Aadhaar, the national biometric identity programme. Millions of people use fingerprint and iris-scan authentication to access a range of public and private services which includes banking, too. Failure to join the effort could limit the tech industry's access to a vast and growing market, but companies like Apple and Google are expected to resist opening up their phones and operating systems to the country's registration, encryption and security technology. "There will be a lot of pushing and shoving by the technology companies," says Neeraj Aggarwal, managing director, Boston Consulting Group, India. "It will be a battle of ecosystems, and companies would do their best to hold on to their own." A few weeks ago, government officials invited executives from Apple, Microsoft, Samsung Electronics and Google to discuss embedding Aadhaar encryption into their technology. None of the companies would comment on what transpired. Apple didn't show up at all. Ajay Bhushan Pandey, chief executive officer, Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), who had convened the meeting, says the industry representatives listened politely and were non-committal. But, Pandey said he was frank about the government's position, telling his visitors: "Go to your headquarters and work this out so that we can have Aadhaar-registered devices." The biometric identity program is something of a path breaker. While the Federal Bureau of Investigation and US VISIT visa program use similar technology to respectively track criminals and foreign visitors, no other country has taken the concept as far as India. Designed in part to help thwart criminals who siphon off billions of dollars in welfare payments each year, Aadhaar helps authenticate millions of poor citizens so the government can send money in lieu of food, fuel and fertilizer subsidies, as well as pension and guaranteed work payments directly to their bank accounts electronically. Civil liberties and citizens' groups say the program violates Indians' privacy; others warn that Aadhaar's servers could be hacked and compromise national security. But the government is moving ahead and in recent weeks has rolled out a digital payments infrastructure built on top of the program. The idea is to bring financial services to a nation where millions have never set foot inside a bank, let alone opened an account. As the country's billion-user Aadhaar jigsaw fits into place, the government plans to ramp up and add a host of other services including education and health care. "We are doing five million authentications daily, and with Aadhaar-compliant devices that number will grow exponentially," Pandey says. "There is a solid business case for technology companies to enable Aadhaar services." Indians would still log into their smartphones using the manufacturer's biometric authentication - typically a fingerprint or iris scan. But once they access Aadhaar using the government's encryption, the likes of Apple and Google would lose the ability to track users online, forfeiting the ability to mine that data to sell ads or other products and services. (Indian law, by the way, bars the government from collecting or using customer data.) Tech companies will probably also object to allowing the government to install its authentication software on their gadgets for fear of security breaches and hacking attacks. Apple has strenuously resisted the U.S. government's demands to build a back door into its operating system so law enforcement can track the movements of terrorists and criminals. "There should be clarity and provisions about security," says Amresh Nandan, a research director at Gartner Inc. On the other hand, foreign tech companies could be at a competitive disadvantage if they don't go along because Indian companies like Flipkart, Paytm and Snapdeal are already making their digital payments and services compatible with Aadhaar. "Once the Aadhaar system grows to scale, technology companies will find it tricky to prevent people from using it," Aggarwal says. Samsung is the only global device-maker currently making an Aadhaar-friendly device, a tablet that's reportedly selling well. Microsoft is said to be working with the government to link Skype with the Aadhaar database so the video calling service can be used to make authenticated calls. Fresh from battles with Washington over encryption, Apple, Google and other U.S. tech companies are less likely to compromise without a fight. For now, Indian authorities are asking politely. That could change. Earlier this year New Delhi mandated that, starting in 2017, all mobile phones sold in India must have a panic button women can push when attacked. Nandan Nilekani, who co-founded the leading tech services firm Infosys Ltd. and helped create the national authentication program, says the government could do exactly the same with Aadhaar. CROSSING SWORDS UIDAI wants devices to be compliant with Aadhaar encryption standards ENCRYPTION Can be hardware based, or enabled on the operating system GLOBAL FIRMS Unlikely to agree to UIDAI request given the complexity of demands AADHAR USERS 1.05 billion users.

Speculation about the timing of the Federal Reserve's next interest rate hike has shaken major stock indexes since last Friday following contrasting comments from Fed officials. The S&P 500 remains down almost 3 percent from before Friday's steep selloff, even though interest rate futures indicate expectations for a rate hike at the Fed's Sept. 20-21 meeting remain low. "What you're seeing is a little preview for what will happen when the Fed does raise rates," said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Cornerstone Financial Partners. "People are starting to make changes to their portfolios." Apple jumped 3.4 percent to a 2016 high, with its market capitalization topping $600 billion for the first time since April as Wall Street bet the technology company's newest iPhone would help shore up falling sales. Its gain helped push the S&P 500 technology index up 0.6 percent, making it the session's strongest sector. Oil prices dropped 2 percent following data that showed large weekly builds in U.S. petroleum products, sending the S&P energy index down 1.09 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 were negative after giving up earlier gains. At 2:18 pm ET, the Dow was down 0.12 percent at 18,045.69 points and the S&P 500 had dipped 0.04 percent to 2,126.27. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.39 percent to 5,175.24. Monsanto agreed to be bought by Bayer, but its stock rose just 0.9 percent to $107.06, well below the offer of $128 per share, due to concerns about regulatory approvals. Vitae Pharmaceuticals shares more than doubled to $20.89 after Allergan said it would buy the company for $639 million. Allergan rose 1.78 percent. Ford fell 1.8 percent after the automaker said 2017 financial performance would decline from this year's levels. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.12-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.01-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 1 new 52-week high and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 37 new highs and 35 new lows.

DJIA S&P 500 NASDAQ Markets Today Jim Cramer: Apple is Getting a Boost from Samsung's Woes Samsung's phone recall and the new iPhone and watches will provide a tailwind for Apple shares, says Jim Cramer. Gregg Greenberg Sep 14, 2016 12:44 PM EDT Samsung's phone recall and the new iPhone and watches will provide a tailwind for Apple (AAPL) shares, says TheStreet's Jim Cramer. Early reviews for Apple's new watch are mixed, but Cramer said the watch's new features make it more of a sport watch than a high fashion accessory. He believes the fashion review is not as important as being able to see who's on the phone and not taking the call. The new Apple Watch, officially dubbed the Apple Watch Series 2, will also come in a specially-branded model that integrates Nike's Nike+ fitness tracking technology and has a unique Nike band.

Bruce Gorton | 2016-09-14 18:40:55.0 The Apple iPhone7 and AirPods are displayed during an Apple media event in San Francisco, California, U.S. September 7, 2016. Image by: BECK DIEFENBACH / REUTERS With the release of the iPhone 7, the company has dropped support for the iPhone 4, as well as the second and third generation of iPads. Save & Share Tweet Email Print The much anticipated iPhone 7 was launched at a San Francisco event last week, and is expected to be out in South Africa from 14 October 2016. According to Reuters the iPhone 7, starting at $649, has one, zooming 12-megapixel camera. The 'Plus' edition, starting at $769, features two cameras. In a controversial move, Apple removed the earphone jack. Instead it comes with headphones that plug into the charger port (so you can’t listen to music and charge the phone at the same time) and will be compatible with Apple’s new wireless Airpods when they come out. A new graphic has been released by Statista, showing how long the company generally supports its older models. You will find more statistics at Statista As can be seen from the chart, the longevity of Apple’s smartphones has improved. But longevity is not the only issue people have with Apple’s new phone, as it has eliminated the traditional headphone jack in favour of new technology – the much mocked Apple Airpod. The airpods cost an extra $159, and are so small that they’re bound to be easily lost. the iPhone 7 starts at $649 and the 'airpod' headphones are sold for an additional $159 pic.twitter.com/MDiMD5ypN6— antonio (@antoniodelotero) September 7, 2016 Who else is positive they're going to lose the Apple airpod headphones?? pic.twitter.com/ofXlrZeZuQ— hypeblvd (@hypeblvd) September 12, 2016 Introducing: The Apple AirPod The first and only golf club designed specifically for mice.

Reuters reports that equipment suppliers and experts are excited with how going wireless will change how users interact with their devices, with several companies already looking to create their own variants of the buds.

Fueled by reports of strong early orders for the iPhone 7 as well as arch-rival Samsung's widely-publicised recall of potentially exploding Galaxy Note 7 smartphones, shares of Apple rose as much as 4.7 percent to $113.03 for a gain of 10 percent in the past three days. Specific details about sales of the new iPhone are scarce after Apple announced last week it would not release weekend sales data, saying the number was more a reflection of supply than demand. But even if the launch proved to be less than explosive, at least the same can be said of the iPhone’s battery. - additional reporting by Reuters Share Tweet SHARE YOUR OPINION If you have an opinion you would like to share on this article, please send us an e-mail to the Times LIVE iLIVE team.

The stock ended the day 3.6 percent higher on Wednesday, its best daily performance since July 27. The stock held between 3.5 percent to about 4 percent higher in afternoon trade after a Bloomberg report that an AT&T executive said iPhone 7 preorders were "up." Earlier in the afternoon, the stock had pared gains to temporarily trade about 3 percent higher amid another Bloomberg report that cited a comment from a Verizon executive that said iPhone preorder volume was within a normal range. The stock remained the top gainer in the Dow Jones industrial average for a second-straight day, briefly adding about 30 points to the Dow by itself. Shares were pacing for their first three-day win streak with consecutive gains over 2 percent since April 2013. It was a big week for the tech giant, with mobile service carrier Sprint and T-Mobile on Tuesday reporting strong preorders for the newest iPhone, which hits store shelves this Friday. The four major carriers offer a free upgrade to the iPhone 7 when users trade in certain older phones and stay on their plan for two years. "We estimate the carriers are losing (about) $300 per iPhone under the trade-in promos," UBS analyst John Hodulik said in a note Wednesday. RBC Capital analyst Amit Daryanani reiterated his outperform rating on the stock Wednesday. He says several tailwinds position Apple to outperform from current levels, including the potential for Apple to grab market share given Samsung's woes with Galaxy Note 7. Apple officially introduced the iPhone 7 and updated Apple Watch last week. The company began taking preorders on Friday for both products. Apple's new iPhone does not have a headphone jack. Phone users may use Bluetooth products or a new Apple AirPod system instead of wire headphones. The phone also has two rear cameras that will allow users to see a live preview with shallow depth of field. Many Wall Street analysts expected those new features to encourage more iPhone users to upgrade. Apple also rolled out the latest version of the company's iPhone software, iOS 10, on Tuesday. The launch did not go smoothly, forcing some phones into recovery mode, otherwise known as "bricking." Apple said the problem was quickly resolved and it apologized to affected customers. Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty reiterated her overweight rating Wednesday for Apple stock, saying it would beat the consensus forecast if just 25 percent of its existing iPhone users were to upgrade their phones. Apple joined the Dow on March 19, 2015, after closing the prior day at $128.47. It's not exactly been a stellar performer – down 9.7 percent since then, even with Wednesday's gains. Its low as a Dow member occurred on May 12, when it dipped as low as $89.47 intraday. — CNBC's Gina Francolla, Peter Schacknow and Anita Balakrishnan contributed to this report.

This visual language has moved well beyond simple entertainment -- it's becoming a language that many are becoming fluent in and turn to in everyday conversations. Apple's upcoming iOS 10 launch will be a seminal moment in this evolution: Making visual expression within iMessage simple and powerful on one billion Apple devices across the world, while posing unique opportunities (and threats) for the industry and accelerating the shift from public to private sharing. Apple's Messages platform will accelerate the larger movement of messengers into the "new browser," further expanding our language from text and pictures to GIFs, videos, stickers and dynamic embeds. With iOS 10, people will have access to apps within iMessage that allow them to seamlessly add a visual layer to the messages they send -- everything from disappearing text to animated GIFs, stickers and videos. These apps are invoked natively from within iMessage, and can tap into many of the same OS-level capabilities as an app that sits on your homescreen. Beyond exposing a tray of app icons inside iMessage, the platform enables users to send fully programmable apps ("MSMessages") that are embedded in iMessage conversations that, when tapped, invoke a fully programmable and dynamic screen. Apple is not the first to introduce this type of platform; Kik launched one of the first HTML5 Messaging platforms back in 2013, and Facebook Messenger pioneered messaging platforms. However, Apple brings two unique powers to bear: It owns and operates the largest and most-used messenger in North America as well as the underlying operating system itself, putting the company in a strong position to dominate the industry. As more people take their conversations from the public web into private conversations via messengers, there's an enormous opportunity for a new category of services as well as a threat to products that rely on public sharing and the web. There's significant friction in switching between a messenger and a web browser, which has led many to offer services within messengers. iOS 10 will take this a step further by making services available directly on top of messaging, either via keyboards or messaging apps. Apple's Messages platform will accelerate the larger movement of messengers into the "new browser," further expanding our language from text and pictures to GIFs, videos, stickers and dynamic embeds. According to Apple's Craig Federighi, iMessage is already the most-used application on iOS. We're spending more and more time inside messengers, sharing privately, sharing ideas, thoughts and feelings. While people use the web as a utility to find information, browse the news or entertain themselves, they are increasingly turning to messengers to communicate. Messaging-first services will have the best understanding of your thoughts, feelings and emotions. Unlike the web, which is organized by hyperlinks, our messengers organize information by the people we talk to with visual, interactive applications floating between us. Unlike companies that dominate the web, services built on top of messaging will be built around communication-focused use cases -- a new center of gravity will form around your emotional graph. This creates an opportunity for developers to build revenue-generating businesses on the platform. Apple's revenue share (70/30) is the same on the Messages apps as it is on homescreen apps. iOS 10 developers can tap much of the same underlying ad infrastructure available in homescreen apps - all with OS-level stability. In the same way that public market investors richly value apps built on top of the iOS homescreen ($350 billion Facebook, $18 billion Snapchat, $9 billion Line), we'll see a new crop of companies emerge on top of messaging platforms. The stability of an operating system-level platform (as opposed to companies relying on SEO or Facebook's News Feed for traffic) will give these companies an upper hand in succeeding and going public. Unlike companies that dominate the web, services built on top of messaging will be built around communication-focused use cases. A new center of gravity will form around your emotional graph, attracting brands and media to create a new form of content best suited for emotional, visual expression. While iOS 10 creates opportunities, it will also have an impact on other players in the industry, who will adjust their platforms in response to Apple's move. While Google does not operate a messenger with the daily scale of iMessage, its recent Jibe acquisition makes it well-positioned to build a coalition of support for RCS, an evolution of MMS that could potentially offer a competitive messaging platform when combined with Android's scale. In the meantime, the bot-based ecosystems from Kik, Facebook Messenger and Telegram will continue to grow, creating a healthy and competitive platform ecosystem. The hidden iOS 10 browser will look much different than the web browsers we're familiar with today -- the content we consume and the interactive applications floating between us will be shaped by our need to privately and visually express our full range of our emotions. © 2016 Re/Code under contract with NewsEdge.

Tim Cook praises new technologies yet again Cook raves over virtual and augmented reality technologies in new interview. By Alistair Charlton September 14, 2016 18:08 BST Apple CEO Tim Cook sees more value in augmented reality than virtual realityReuters Augmented reality (AR) will be "by far" a much more popular technology than virtual reality (VR), claims Apple chief executive Tim Cook. Although it has got off to a slow start for now, augmented reality includes technologies like Microsoft Hololens and the ill-fated Google Glass. Virtual reality is the more popular for now, with the likes of the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive at the high-end sold alongside Google Cardboard and Samsung Gear VR at the sub-£100 level. But Cook expects to see AR overtake because of its ability to be more socially engaging than VR, which completely covers the user's eyes with an alternate reality. Speaking to Good Morning America, Cook said: "My own view is that augmented reality is the larger of the two, probably by far, because this gives the capability for both of us to sit and be very present talking to each other, but also have other things visually for both of us to see." Augmented reality systems like the Hololens partially cover the wearer's eyes, letting them see the real world around them, but also elements that are computer generated. A plumber, for example, could see the pipe he is fixing in reality, alongside instructions projected virtually onto a nearby wall. Apple's interest in augmented reality is nothing new. In January it was reported by the Financial Times that the iPhone maker has assembled "a large team of experts in virtual reality and augmented reality and built prototype headsets that could one day rival Facebook's Oculus Rift or Microsoft's Hololens." The secret unit is claimed to include "hundreds of staffers" who have joined Apple through poaching and buying up relevant AR and VR startups. Cook also sang AR's praises in July, saying Apple is "high on AR in the long run" and praised the success of Pokemon Go, which uses augmented reality, as "incredible". Continuing to explain his interest in AR, Cook added: "Maybe it's something we're talking about [that we can see in AR], maybe it's someone else here that is not here, present, but could be made to appear to be present with us. So there's a lot of really cool things here." Dismissing VR, Cook said the technology "sort of encloses and immerses the person into an experience that can be really cool but probably has a lower commercial interest over time". Apple is famous for giving very little away about future products, or even what direction the company is planning to take. However, when addressing VR's niche audience, Cook concluded: "There are some really cool areas [in VR] for education and gaming that we have a lot of interest in."

 Apple's value has grown by $54 billion since Monday Kif Leswing Sep. 14, 2016, 12:43 PM 6,013 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple CEO Tim CookDrew Angerer/Getty Images Apple stock is in the middle of a torrid three day rally. Apple stock was up more than 4% in midday trading on Wednesday to $112.64 per share. The stock opened at $102.68 on Monday, so it's up nearly 9.5% for the week, adding almost $54 billion to Apple's market cap.  For reference, consider that Twitter's entire market cap is $12.7 billion. Netflix has a $42 billion market cap.  Of course, Apple is the most valuable company in the world, with its total market cap now standing at a whopping $605.68 billion.  The sudden surge in Apple share appears to have been sparked by signs that the new iPhone 7, which hits store shelves on Friday, may outperform lackluster sales expectations. Carriers like T-Mobile have said their iPhone 7 preorders are beating expectations, and gadget reviewers who have gotten their hands on the iPhone 7 have been generally impressed (though not necessarily blown away). Analysts are picking up on the positive signs as well.  "We believe healthy August sell-through and lean iPhone 6s inventories in conjunction with more assertive carrier promotions set up for a better-than-expected iPhone 7 launch," Pacific Crest Securities analysts wrote in a note distributed to clients on Wednesday.  The current price is a 5-month high for Apple, and shares traded hands on Wednesday at nearly double the average daily volume.  Here's the daily chart:  Google Here's what Apple has done over the past five days:Google   SEE ALSO: iPhone 7 review: Apple's lead in smartphones is pretty thin NOW WATCH: An exercise scientist reveals how often and for how long you should work out to see real results Loading video...

Home Church & Ministries U.S. World Politics Entertainment living Opinion iOS 10 News, Features & Updates: iPhone, iPad Major 'Brick' Issue, How to Install and What You Should Know [DETAILS] By Mariel Peralta Sep 14, 2016 | 4:12 AM Apple has finally released the official iOS 10 version for iPhones and iPads. The newly announced iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will be the first two phones that will ship with the iOS 10 directly. The iOS 10 did not bring much changes in terms of design, but it packed a ton of features with its update. iOS 10 News, Update, Features The major changes brought by the iOS 10 are most visible in the Apple Music redesign, Photos App, Messages, and Home App to name a few. The Apple Music has been redesigned by the iOS 10 and according to Forbes, it has become brighter and bigger. Song lyrics can be seen at the bottom of the player for those who'd like to sing along to the playing song. The app also has a Discovery Mix feature that tailors its music for the user based on what they like and listen to. Yes, I want Breaking Christian News Submit For the Photos App in iOS 10, Apple has included facial recognition so that the people present in the photos can be grouped in one album. It also recognizes locations and groups photos taken in that area. For the Messages, the iOS 10 enabled it to have a separate app called the iMessage, an online messaging app. It can support third-party applications which can also be opened from inside the app. Emojis, bubble effect and invisible ink effect are also included in the new update which makes messaging more animated compared to the past. How to Download, Install iOS 10 Downloading the iOS 10 to your Apple device is easy. Go to Settings, head to General, then go to Software Update, and then you will need to download it over-the-air (OTA), Mashable reports. It is recommended to backup your device's data first before updating it to have iOS 10. iOS 10 Major Issue Some users have had some issues when they upgraded to the iOS 10. According to The Verge, the issue is a failed update process where the device asks to be plugged to a PC to restore the OS. However, Apple said that it has corrected the issue and explained in a support page for those who are still having the problems. The issue apparently happened in the first hour and an Apple spokesperson told the outlet that the iOS 10 should be safe to install.

Known as "AirPods", Apple showcased the technology as part of what the company envisages as a "wireless future" - headphones that are completely independent of each other that can be used individually as well as in a pair.

(Photo: Reuters/Beck Diefenbach) Naturally, there were mixed reactions from Apple fans and critics alike, as many people expressed their concern they would instantly lose the tiny devices. Read More Worried about losing your expensive AirPods? This company claims to have the solution However, Apple's big cheese Tim Cook used an interview with Good Morning America to reassure potential users that this is not the case. Apple CEO Tim Cook Speaking with ABC News' Robin Roberts about the concerns consumers might have about Apple's new AirPods, he said he "never personally had one fall out since using them" and has used them on treadmills. He also suggested that it's the weight of the wires that pull the headphones out of people's ears, and by cutting the wires, the earbuds should now stay in place. "There's a little case that you put the Airpods in and magnetically they're sort of sucked down into the case,"Cook told Roberts. "The wires tend to help the ear bud fall out right because it applies weight on the earbuds. "By snipping the wires, I have never personally had one fall out since I have been using them." Read More Apple is releasing wireless AirPod headphones and everyone is making the same joke With the introduction of the AirPods alongside the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, Apple made the big decision to remove the 3.5mm headphone jack, one of the boldest moves in smartphone design in recent years. Apple believes its AirPods headphones will lead this charge and "reinvent how we listen to music" (Photo: REUTERS) The reason behind the decision, Apple exec Phil Schiller said, was "the courage to move on and do something new that betters all of us". Apple believes its AirPod headphones will lead this charge and "reinvent how we listen to music, make phone calls, enjoy TV and movies, play games, and interact with Siri".

They can, Apple says, switch "seamlessly" between entertainment and calls.

Multimedia Today's Paper Topics ePaper WealthCheck SEARCH Follow Home News Markets Companies Money & Banking Economy Info-tech Opinion Specials Portfolio Catalyst BLink Auto focus Clean Tech Emerging Entrepreneurs Flight Plan India File India Interior Pulse Technophile Luxe New Manager Is the iPhone 7 a worthy upgrade? S. Muralidhar   ·   print   ·   T+  ·   T- Tweet The Apple iPhone7 and AirPods that were displayed during an Apple media event in San Francisco, California, US recently. - Reuters The iPhone 7’s aren’t dramatically different, but a look at new features will tell whether to buy one The disappearance of the 3.5mm audio socket and the rework of the home button were already staple mentions on gossip columns and tech websites much before the launch of the iPhone 7. Steve Jobs would have been furious with such laxity. Yet, there are a few surprising new features in the pair of new iPhones that Apple unveiled last week. Design is certainly not one of them. The overall look and shape of the new iPhones have remained the same over the past three iterations, save the changes to the antenna line in the new ones. So, should you go in for the upgrade if you already own an iPhone? And if you are planning to jump ship from Android, are the upgrades in the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus worth emptying your wallet for upward of ₹60,000? Or should you wait for that deal on the 6s? Design and display The screen on the iPhone 7 is the same Retina HD display as on the 6s — it's just that it's now 25 per cent brighter and shows a wider gamut of colours. The new Home button with Taptic engine feedback could be an interesting addition, but it is too fringe to become a factor influencing a buy call. A similar point would be the new dust and water resistance feature, where Apple is by now only a follower, not a trendsetter. The new Jet Black body finish looks awesome in pictures, but our guess is that if you are a heavy user, the matt black might be the one to choose. The super glossy Jet Black finish is guaranteed to be prone to fingerprints and scratches. Upgraded camera The iPhone 7 gets a new 12MP camera with an f/1.8 aperture lens and optical image stabilisation. This is a big jump in performance over the 6s, because the new lens will allow more light into the sensor (50 per cent more than 6s) and the optical stabilisation will deliver much better results than the kind of stabilisation that can be achieved by software. So, low light photography should produce much better, less grainy results. Flash photos should be better too thanks to the the quad LEDs. But, it is the iPhone 7 Plus that gets two cameras positioned side by side and both 12MP each. This arrangement is meant to deliver greater depth to your photos and to be able to generate that key 'Bokah' effect for portraits and close-ups. But, one capability that will be unique to the 7 Plus is optical zoom upto 2X. The new cameras are great but unless you're quite a phone photography enthusiast, the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus cameras are fantastic in themselves. There are a lot of apps that can also help add depth and Bokeh in post-processing. Processor power The iPhone 7's new A10 Fusion chip offers an incremental improvement in processing power, graphics speeds and battery efficiency. The numbers are only impressive compared to the iPhone 6 and much less attractive when compared to the 6s. So, unless you are an Apple loyalist or a performance addict, the 6s' performance should suffice from the perspective of processing power. That would be the recommendation even if you are big into gaming on your phone. But, the reason the iPhone 7 could be more attractive is the doubling of memory. With apps taking over our lives, the need for higher capacity has never been more urgent. And there are no memory cards with Apple devices, so the larger capacity is most welcome. With the iPhone 7's camera capable of shooting in RAW format and also taking 4K videos the larger memory will definitely be useful. Many of today's games take up space and even their updates (like Asphalt 8 Airborne's) are larger than 1GB. Sound of music The stereo speakers on the iPhone 7 are welcome, not so the elimination of the 3.5mm audio socket. But then, you can't complain since Apple is including the lightning to 3.5mm adapter in the box. Also, with the lighting socket doubling up as the audio port and with the possibility of it delivering power for headphones with active noise cancellation, this could turn out to be a blessing eventually. Down to cash True iPhone fans need little persuasion to move to the next version. But it comes down to whether you want to spend the cash on an iteration of what already works quite well. If you're using a really old version of the iPhone, and can spare the money, certainly look at the new iPhone 7's. If not, wait for a good deal on the iPhone 6s or 6s Plus. As far as software goes, the operating system is now upgrading for everyone, with the release of iOS 10 and new features will come in on old devices.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Real Estate Classifieds Site Archive UPDATE: Apple Valley Town Council approves ban on marijuana with glimmer of hope for activists Wednesday Sep 14, 2016 at 9:46 AM Sep 14, 2016 at 4:37 PM Rene Ray De La Cruz Staff Writer @DP_ReneDeLaCruz APPLE VALLEY — After a marathon meeting that lasted well beyond midnight, the Town Council passed a strict marijuana ordinance with the intention of revisiting the item. During the meeting that began Tuesday evening, the Apple Valley Town Council codified its moratorium that bans marijuana dispensaries, manufacturing and cultivation. However, many medical marijuana activists in the audience were overjoyed when the Council agreed to bring back the agenda item, with the possibility of medical marijuana delivery. Attorney Pamela Epstein, who represents the High Desert Cannabis Association, told the Daily Press she was pleased by the Council’s decision, calling the consideration to allow cannabis delivery “baby steps” in the right direction. “I am cautiously optimistic about what happened this evening and I think every first step is shaky, just like your first step when you are a child,” Epstein said. “We really made some progress with the Council members. And really, all you need is three.” The “three” members Epstein was referring to, besides Mayor Barb Stanton, were Mayor Pro Tem Scott Nassif and Councilmen Larry Cusack and Art Bishop. “I think we started a robust discussion about delivery and we proved to the Council that delivery is what the people want,” Epstein said. “I think the anti-marijuana people were outnumbered 40 to 10 in opposition of the ban.” Epstein said she’ll be meeting with the Town’s attorneys as they prepare to carve out the amendment to ordinance that would allow for the delivery of medical marijuana within the town limits of Apple Valley. “The High Desert Cannabis Association has already written delivery language for the city of Hesperia so we can work with Apple Valley to upscale the timeline,” Epstein said. “Unlike the comments from Council member Curt Emick and Mayor Pro Tem Nassif, we can control where these deliveries are. They can be clearly and pragmatically regulated.” The Council also discussed tabling the marijuana agenda item and waiting for the outcome of Proposition 64, a November state ballot measure designed to legalize recreational marijuana and establish a 15 percent sales tax, cultivation tax of $9.25 per ounce for flowers and $2.75 per ounce for leaves. The six-hour meeting, which included public comment by an army of medical marijuana activists and a handful of those opposed to cannabis use, also included a video and slide presentation by Scott Chipman, the Southern California chair of Citizens Against Legalizing Marijuana. During Chipman’s lengthy presentation, he equated the marketing efforts of today’s cannabis industry to the push by the tobacco industry in the ‘50s and ’60s, when cigarette brands sponsored TV shows, invented jingles and slogans, made smoking attractive and used physicians to tout the benefits of smoking. Using several medical research studies, Chipman refuted the claims of the cannabis industry that boasts the medicinal benefits of cannabis. He added that CBD oil may have some benefit, but most of the product on the market is untested and dangerous. He added that cannabis is the “snake oil” of today’s generation. Chipman displayed news articles of children dying at the hands of parents who were using marijuana and adults who either became addicted or died because of the “gateway drug.” During public comment, Epstein and a small army of medical cannabis activists, including several seniors, refuted several of Chipman’s claims. One senior woman, who struggled to the podium with a cane, “My pain right now, on a scale of one to 10, I am pushing 20. Marijuana is what makes it possible for me to stand here right now.” Kasha Herrington, a member of the HDCA, gave an impassioned speech to the Council, saying that children die at the hands of parents because their neglect. She added, that the Council continues to “isolate” and magnify certain tragedies associated with cannabis use. “You look at use like we’re crazy, I’m not crazy,” Herrington said. “It has not affected me mentally, it has not affected my ability to function, I don’t have brain damage — it has helped me.” One woman said traffic fatalities have doubled and expulsions from school have increased as a direct result of marijuana use. She stated, “Kids are bringing marijuana to school because weed is cool, and it’s legal, and it’s advertised as a medicine.” Business woman Laura Hardin, who is also a member of the HDCA, told the Council marijuana has helped her through the physical and mental trauma that she has suffered. She also interjected a bit of humor when she told the audience that marijuana is "a gateway drug to the refrigerator." Community leader Kelly Bergstrom told the Council, “The point tonight is that we don’t want it in our town. I moved here from Victorville and I like the way the town is now.” She added that she doesn’t care if people are obtaining and using marijuana, “Get if from where you are getting it now. You don’t need to be getting it from Apple Valley.” The council members expressed their concern and understanding for those suffering and wanting to find relief, including Emick who said his opposition to marijuana use comes from a place of concern for the “public safety” of children and adults. “These people are here at our doorstep asking for us to help them,” Stanton said. “How far do we go saying no?

Trending in Apple How Apple’s stock apps will use the Touch Bar on the new MacBook Pro [Gallery] September 9 AAPL: 103.13 -2.39 The 9to5Mac team’s favorite wireless headphones for the iPhone 7 Greg Barbosa - 2 months ago @gregbarbosa AirPods Bose wireless headphones Jaybird Wireless earbuds View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Without a doubt the biggest consumer-facing news from Apple’s September event yesterday was the removal of the iPhone’s headphone jack. This “courageous” move is seen to help push forward wireless audio technology, all the while giving Apple a few more millimeters to work with in the device’s internals. Not without controversy, this decision does mean leaving a lot of wired headphones in the dust. Not everyone will find the AirPods, expected in October, the default choice and we figured this would be a good time as any to roundup the 9to5Mac team’s opinions on their current favorite pair (or 2) of wireless headphones. Take a look through and be sure to share your current favorite wireless audio options in the comments. Seth Weintraub I’m in the “sad to see the 3.5mm jack go” camp but we’ve known for months that this was going to happen so I’ve been doing a lot of testing of wireless options. I’ve never loved the sound of Beats wireless headphones but truthfully, I haven’t tested the ones Apple announced yesterday. My current favorites are the Bose Quiet Comfort 35s that I reviewed 2 months ago ($349 at Amazon). The sound is perfect for me, they connect via Bluetooth 4 and have a great voice status update whenever activated. They last all day, are super comfortable on my head and have a premium feel.  For me, the noise cancellation is the game changer however and everything else doesn’t compare. The downside to the Bose QC35s are that they are heavy and hot for doing exercise or even mowing the lawn (though they do surreally cut out the engine noise). Here, again, there is no way those AirPods or Bragi Dashes would stay in my ears so I use a cheap $13 Chinese Amazon wireless which sound OK but usually last a few months before I lose or break them. That being said, I ‘hear’ great things about Jaybirds and Bose Soundsports. Jeff Benjamin Count me in the camp that is glad to see the 3.5mm headphone jack go. Although I think that Apple’s claim of “courage” was a bit silly, I’m still happy to see advancements being made in this area. The idea of wireless headphones is great, but Bluetooth as a technology has not made the transition easy. As such, I’m extremely bullish on Apple’s new W1 wireless chip, and all of the advancement that it brings to the table with regard to connectivity. But it’s very obvious that not everyone is a fan (shocker) of the first device to utilize the W1, Apple’s new wireless AirPods. The design is quite polarizing, and at $159, I understand why many would be hesitant to pony up that sort of cash. If you’re looking for a pair of headphones a little more “normal-looking” then I can recommend Beats’ PowerBeats 2 wireless headphones. Keep in mind that Apple has refreshed the PowerBeats and other Beats headphones to include the new W1 chip, but going for the older generation will save you at least $50. I’m also a firm believer in purchasing a cheap pair of Bluetooth headphones just to kick around in. For example, I use Aukey’s EP-B20’s when performing tasks around the house like mowing the lawn. I’d never consider doing such work while using AirPods, but at only $17.99 on Amazon, I can afford to ill-treat these wireless headphones. Greg Barbosa I’m right there alongside Jeff in being happy that the 3.5mm headphone jack is gone. I’m a firm believer that Apple won’t retract this decision, and instead trudge forward hoping the rest of the market follows through. While I don’t think wireless audio has gotten to a point where I’m completely happy, I do believe it’s gotten to a point where I’m complacent in the listening experience. Guessing that Apple was going to make a strong push towards their own true wireless earbuds, I’ve spent the past few months researching and testing a few different pairs. My first pair, the imperfect Syllable D900s ($69 on Amazon), gave me a taste of what would eventually come of the technology. I quickly moved onto the Earin true wireless earbuds ($279.49 on Amazon), and I can say I’m a huge fan. Light-weight, compact, and feeling right at home in my ears, I can’t think of too many ways on how I would improve them further. (Keep an eye out for a lengthy review on them in the coming days.) While I continue to test true wireless earbuds, I’ve still got my eye out for a pair of wireless headphones I find comforting. Unfortunately no matter which headphones I’ve used, all the headbands and ear-muffs end up giving my some sort of headache. I could never quite find the perfect fit, but I’ll continue to search around. Stephen Hall I lean in the direction of being okay with the headphone jack being gone, because I think that a wirelessly connected future really is the direction we’re headed. But I’m still disappointed that such a long-held and time-tested standard (read: a good standard) was just easily disposed of in the name of courage — especially from a historically music-friendly Apple. That said, at least the Cupertino company left us with a few options: use a dongle, use Bluetooth headphones, or buy into the improved AirPods experience. I think many people will try the dongle, but will quickly realize that it’s annoying and eventually go with Bluetooth headphones for their daily listening (or, if they’re die-hards, buy the AirPods or some new Beats). It just so happens that I recently went on a brief search for some decent Bluetooth headphones, and since I’m a cheapskate, and generally don’t like earbuds, I have some over-the-head Bluetooth headsets to suggest. I picked up the Ausdom M04 headphones on sale last year for $30 (currently $46 shipped on Amazon), and I’ve been more than satisfied. They offer a pretty reliable connection, pair almost instantly when you power them on, and sound good enough for how much they cost. Another recommendation I have — and this one is kind of different from the rest in this article — is the AfterShokz Trekz bone conduction headphones, available on Amazon for $130 shipped. That’s a lot more than the $40 Ausdoms, but these are a completely different breed. I’ve been using them for only about a week now, and have mostly good things to say — especially if you’re looking for Bluetooth headphones for running or biking. It can be dangerous in some situations to have your ears completely plugged, and these let you still hear the environment while still providing good sound quality. I’ll have more to say about these in a forthcoming review on 9to5Toys. Zac Hall I’m not one for kicking and screaming when technology changes. You only get burned when you try to stick to the past. Eventually things break and are hard to replace or you end up with dongle after dongle and just look ridiculous. No thanks. So I’ve gone through the stages of grief with the death of the headphone jack. I’ve counted maybe two times that I’ve used it on my iPhone 6s Plus since the story broke back in November. Every morning I work out with the (pricey but solid) Bose QC35’s ($349) while listening to music or watching a TV show on my iPad (which has a headphone jack!). The noise-cancelling feature is really impressive. My home office was noisier than usual over the summer when my wife and kid were out of daycare and college, but they were no match for the QC35s! Over-ear headphones are too much for outdoor cycling which I also do regularly, though, and anything wired feels like an accident waiting to happen. I want exactly zero noice cancelling when I’m listening out for cars, too, so I currently just use the speaker on my iPhone to play podcasts or music. I’d consider Apple’s upcoming AirPods ($159) if I knew they fit well, but EarPods that come with the iPhone hurt my ears after just a few minutes. Just people are saying that the AirPods are more comfortable so maybe that’s where I’ll land next month. I do have a pair of these relatively inexpensive Jabra Bluetooth earbuds for using while running outdoors, but I’d probably recommend splurging on one of the upcoming pairs from Beats with the W1 chip for easy pairing and switching between iPhone and Apple Watch. PowerBeats3 replace the existing PowerBeats2 set but keep the microUSB port while the cheaper and new BeatsX also include the W1 and have Lightning. Jordan Kahn I’ve already mostly made the transition to wireless Bluetooth headphones for use with my iPhone— the very popular Jaybird Freedom In-Ear Wireless earbuds are my current daily drivers—so I wasn’t fazed by iPhone 7 losing the 3.5mm headphone jack. They aren’t the cheapest option at around $175, but they come in an extremely sleek package with premium sweat-proof metal earbuds that are smaller than most wired earbuds, Apple’s EarPods included. You get around 4 hours of battery life, but a small charging clip attaches to the built-in remote and mic to give you an extra 4hrs on the go. And they come with a large selection of foam and silicone tips and soft rubber ear fins.  While I’m ready for wireless headphones and iPhone 7, I’m not entirely ready to jump to truly wireless, cord-free headphones like some others. I’ve tested a few pairs—the Bragi Dash included— and the experience was far too half baked and not up to par with my Jaybirds to use on the daily. Not to mention the lack of a cord still seems more of an annoyance for my usage (Bragi and others sell a “leash” for that reason). I’m looking forward to testing Apple’s new AirPods when released in October— they don’t seem to be wowing too many people just yet— but I’ll be skipping the cord-free earbuds this time around.

Although it appears to be a great tool to have in the bag, it’s not going to have your DSLR collecting dust, depending on the type of photographer you are. Limitations of the depth of field feature on iPhone 7 Plus For starters, the depth of field feature, which isn’t scheduled to launch until later this fall via a software update, appears to only work with real people. On Apple’s website, it explains what the depth of field effect is for (emphasis mine): Depth of field allows you to keep faces sharp while creating a blurred effect in the background. When you take a shot with iPhone 7 Plus, the dual-camera system uses both cameras and advanced machine learning to make your subject sharp while creating the same out-of-focus blur in the background — known as the bokeh effect — previously reserved for DSLR cameras. So no matter what’s behind your subject, it’s easy to create a great portrait. Portrait: noun 1. a painting, drawing, photograph, or engraving of a person, especially one depicting only the face or head and shoulders. Although we didn’t receive an expansive demonstration of the impressive new feature, the wording used in press materials suggests that the depth of field effect will be limited to those occasions when shooting photos of real people, not inanimate objects. This means that product photography, for instance, won’t be able to take advantage of the depth of field feature. Although Apple hasn’t fully expounded on the ways that the feature can be wielded, it was very careful in its message on its website. Phil Schiller, Apple’s SVP of Worldwide Marketing, was also careful in his wording as he explained the advantages of the 7 Plus’ camera system: There’s one other use of this camera that we challenged our engineering team to do as an extra credit project. It really was, it’s something that is incredibly challenging and takes a lot of amazing invention, but what they’ve been doing is astounding. And it’s something that’s a big breakthrough in photography, and we want to give you a sneak peak of this feature. What they’re able to do, when we take a picture, is to use the ISP to scan the scene. To use machine learning to recognize people and faces and then create a depth map of that image from the two cameras and the software. Keep the people in front sharp in focus, and apply a beautiful blur to the background. This feature, once it ships, will be available via a new Portrait style within the stock Camera app on the iPhone 7 Plus. After selecting Portrait style, the software automatically switches to the 56mm telephoto lens, and displays a deep depth preview, which is generated in real time as you’re looking at the screen. That’s mighty impressive, and it’s something Apple notes that DSLRs aren’t currently capable of doing. For the record, Apple isn’t claiming that its cameras replace DSLRs, as Schiller explained during the end of the 7 Plus camera demonstration: Now we are not saying to throw out your DSLRs and that iPhone replaces all of the DSLRs. What we are saying is this is the best camera we have ever made in an iPhone. This is the best camera ever made in any smartphone. For many of the customers who have it, it’ll probably be the best camera they’ve ever owned to date. But more importantly it allows them to create beautiful pictures with incredible creative tools. Apple’s new Portrait style in the iPhone 7 Plus’ Camera app appears to be, at least at this stage in the game, limited to portrait photography of human subjects. In other words, don’t expect to be able to use the iPhone 7 Plus’ camera to pull off stunning high-bokeh scenery pictures devoid of human subjects, or photos of inanimate objects with drastically blurred backgrounds yet. Such functionality could theoretically be incorporated by means of a software update, but it doesn’t appear that the camera will gain those capabilities initially. Right now, it’s unclear how much you’ll be able to adjust shallow depth of field effect, if at all. You’ll also, apparently, be limited to using the effect inside of the stock Camera app, as there was no mention of third-party-accessible APIs. Of course, all of this is subject to change, and most likely will be changed as the software grows and matures. DSLRs are safe Apple’s ability to bring us DSLR-like functionality is very impressive, but one must remember that it’s the software, not so much the hardware, that makes this feature possible in such a diminutive package. This presents advantages and disadvantages for Apple. It’s an advantage, because Apple is a much more nimble and capable software developer than any camera manufacturer can ever hope to be. At the same time, Apple is limited by physics. There’s simply no way to produce the true bokeh effects made possible by fast glass and camera bodies with full frame sensors. Point and shoot manufactures will continue to suffer as Apple eats most of its lunch — the new slightly wider 28mm lens, ƒ/1.8 aperture, and updated glass and sensor will make videos and photos even more impressive — but true photo enthusiasts who want control over every aspect of their shots will not be fazed and will continue to buy standalone cameras. Software tricks aside, nothing can replace hardware solely built for taking great photos, not to mention videos, which Apple’s new shallow depth of field feature doesn’t appear to support either. Schiller sums it up nicely: It’s not for every style of picture you’re going to take, but for the ones you want to use it on, it’s a pretty big breakthrough.

It’s also updated its leather cases with a brand new subtle detail — machined aluminum Sleep and volume buttons. It’s a small detail, but the presence of aluminum buttons should make a noticeable difference from a tactile perspective. One of my biggest complaints with previous iPhone leather cases was that the buttons were too difficult to press due to the inflexibility of the leather. This updated design should increase the tactility of both the volume buttons and the Sleep button. Here is Apple’s description of the new leather cases: These Apple-designed cases fit snugly over the curves of your iPhone without adding bulk. They’re made from specially tanned and finished European leather, so the outside feels soft to the touch and develops a natural patina over time. On the inside, a microfiber lining helps protect your iPhone. And the machined aluminum buttons match the finish of your iPhone case. As noted, the aluminum buttons also color match the finish of the case itself. So if you have a Storm Gray iPhone 7 Leather Case, you’ll get Storm Gray machined aluminum buttons to match the color of the leather. Apple’s iPhone 7 Leather Case comes in a variety of colors like Sea Blue, Storm Gray, Tan, Saddle Brown, Midnight Blue, Black, and (Product) Red. The iPhone 7 version sells for $45.00, with the Plus variety selling for $49.00. Apple also sells silicone cases, although these do not come with aluminum buttons. Apple’s iPhone 7 Silicone Case is more flexible than leather and button response is a lot better on the silicone cases than the old leather cases. Therefore, aluminum buttons aren’t as necessary from an interfacing perspective. You can learn all about the new iPhone 7 case offerings in our iPhone 7 case roundup post. We’ll have more details and a hands-on look at the updated iPhone 7 Leather Case in a future post.

Tonight the NYTimes is reporting that Apple is again rebooting the now infamous car project. In a retrenchment of one of its most ambitious initiatives, Apple has shuttered parts of its self-driving car project and laid off dozens of employees, according to three people briefed on the move who were not allowed to speak about it publicly. 2016 has been an abysmal year for Apple’s car project if you believe the various reports from top news agencies. A timeline of Apple Car developments this year: Steve Zadesky who originally headed the Apple Car project left 8 months ago. At Apple, he was asked to triple the size of the automotive team, which stood at around 600 employees in September, as well as to come up with a vision for the product. The car team at Apple, the report claims, has had issues coming up with clear goals for the product. The team has reportedly felt that the goals set by Apple are not attainable, but the company has urged the team to push ahead and try to meet them. It is said that Apple set a ship date for 2019 for Project Titan. The WSJ reported 2 months ago that Bob Mansfield the legendary Apple hardware boss who built the iPhone and led Apple’s ultra-successful hardware manufacturing business up until a few years ago would be taking over the project. Then last month, Bloomberg reported that Mansfield had hired Dan Dodge from his CEO role at QNX and shifted its priorities away from building a car to building an autonomous driving system. It also mentioned the program getting a reboot. Of note, the automobile disruption coming from electrification, autonomous driving and sharing has captured the imagination of Silicon Valley making it incredibly hard to keep good employees and management. Today’s NYTimes report borrows heavily from the previous information but does go into more detail of the retrenchment and does include the nugget that Apple is actually at the point where it is driving autonomous vehicles on what sounds like a closed track. Apple has also made some headway in the space. The company has a number of fully autonomous vehicles in the middle of testing, using limited operating routes in a closed environment, according to people briefed on the company’s plans. At this point, it would seem like Apple may want to either bring a car team in from another manufacturer or buy a whole company – if only to solidify the management structure and integrity of the team. While a Tesla buyout has been thrown around in the media and CEO Elon Musk did have meetings with Apple’s M&A head, there are a lot of other startups in the Valley and elsewhere that can be had for much less money. 2020 isn’t that far off.   Guides Apple Car | Everything we know about Apple's rumored electric car.

As you can see for yourself, its elegant curvature elegantly complements the iPhone 7 design. For starters, the HiRise 2 is available in a new black colorway that looks great with Apple’s new matte and glossy black iPhone 7 finishes, as well as in snow white which Twelve South says seamlessly fits in any home or office décor. It’s got one-third smaller footprint than its predecessor to save even more space on your bedside or desk. And because it’s now twice as heavy, it provides added stability with larger devices like iPads (although still not recommended for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro). Due to its tilted angle, the HiRise 2 lets you use your iOS device hands-free while it’s charging, watch movies, engage in FaceTime video calls, present your latest work or just use it as a second-screen for keeping an eye on your Twitter feed, emails and more. “Unlike many other stands, ours does not block or muffle the sound coming out of your iPhone 7 stereo speakers,” reads the press release. Another productivity-boosting idea: perch your iPad atop the stand to raise its screen to a more comfortable height, then use the tablet as an external display for your Mac with a little help from the Duet Display app. “You can also park HiRise near your favorite Bluetooth speaker to stream hours of music knowing your iPhone will be charged when you’re ready to go,” says Twelve South. The stand comes with the included height clips and features rear support that slides back and forth allowing you to adjust both its height and depth to fit your device model or accommodate devices in protective cases, minimal shells or no case at all. Works with Siri Remote, cases & more Lastly, its versatile, smart design allows the HiRise 2 to charge pretty much any Lightning-equipped device, including the Siri Remote, Apple’s new wireless AirPods earphones, Magic accessories such as the Magic Mouse 2 and the Magic Keyboard, and most third-party game controllers for that matter. Plus, it with most iPhone cases so you won’t need to remove your case in order to use your iPhone with the HiRise 2, courtesy of the included cord clips that ensure that even cases with deeply recessed ports fit while docked and charging. Availability The standard-edition $39.99 HiRise 2 is available in Silver, Technical Black and Matte White to complement the finish of your iPhone and iPad. There’s also a Deluxe edition which costs $20 more and includes all of the features of the HiRise 2, plus some additional items in the box like an MFi-certified Lightning cable (available in three sizes), a Micro-USB cable for charging battery packs and other devices and Micro-USB cable clips in three sizes. Both HiRise 2 editions are available beginning today from Amazon, Twelve South’s web store (with free shipping in U.S.) and other retailers. The HiRise charging stand is also available in editions for the MacBook, iMac and Apple Watch.

By Anthony Bouchard, Sep 14, 2016 Tweet 100 Comments Apple officially launched iOS 10 to the hands of the public this week with more than 100 new features for iPhone and iPad users. It looks like an exciting update, but we know some people are still wary of updating this early in the game. So to find out where you stand, we’ve launched another poll you can participate in. The iOS 10 release took Apple’s download servers by storm. I remember having to restart my download at least six separate times because it kept timing out in iTunes, but eventually I tried an over-the-air update on my iPad and it worked. Things went smoothly for most of the community that was updating, but for a few, there was a fluke that reportedly caused a number of people updating over-the-air to have to restore their iOS device to factory settings. Fortunately, that problem was dealt with swiftly and most people weren’t affected. For those that were, having a backup made of their iOS device like we recommended before the update process meant they were able to get back on their feet in just minutes. Although lots of people upgraded, many people are choosing to keep their jailbreak on iOS 8 or iOS 9 as opposed to having iOS 10 because being able to modify it in any way without Apple’s say-so is their #1 priority. And honestly, we can’t blame them. So iDB, we’re curious where you stand. Did you update to iOS 10 already, or not? Let us know what you did in the Poll below: Have you updated to iOS 10 yet? Stay tuned to iDB for the latest news and tutorials on iOS 10. We’re working around the clock to keep you updated with everything we find new in Apple’s new mobile operating system. Share: Tweet Follow: Follow @iDownloadBlog We Recommend Poll: will you upgrade to iOS 10 or keep your jailbreak? Apple releases iOS 10.1.1 with bug fixes for Health data iOS 9 downgrades no longer possible as Apple stops signing iOS 9.3.5 Downgrades no longer possible as Apple stops signing iOS 9.3 for some devices Related Topics Apple, Firmware, iOS, iOS 10, iPad, iPhone, Jailbreak, Opinion, Poll, Software David Gow I regret it I should have kept jailbreak Mr.Coolfreak i used to be a hard core jailbreaker, but just feel that barely any devs are putting out any innovative tweaks Furrnace What you said Mr.Coolfreak. I’ve been a hardcore jailbreaker since the 3G days. But I’ve liked being on the newest updates; Apple’s doing much better about getting the features out (finally) that I used to have to otherwise jailbreak to get before. Quick reply was a HUGE one for me, used to JB just for that alone. And lockscreen tweaks; but I’m really digging the new notifications center, especially right from the lock screen. Leviscus Tempris I agree the notifications panel on the lock screen was brilliant. I just hate to loose the swipe to unlock. I hate killing my home button twice as fast. Cristian Meneses Apple is continuously taking JB ideas into iOS… Useful stuff like control center did not exist before.. Night shift, blacklisting phone numbers, even Tethering, all of those were tweaks. I use to jailbreak all my iOS devices, but as iOS gets better at integrating these tweaks, I’ve been losing interest on jailbreaking. Rowan09 True they even add announcing names when someone calls. Mark S Apple’s blacklisting ain’t got nothing on iblacklist. That is how you make a blacklist program, not Apple’s weak method. Tyler Smith I disagree. People come up with issues and there are many many tweaks which deal with things on ios. In my mind there will always be a need for jailbreaking. Serban Really? Regardless of the state of the jb community right now, “VirtualHome”. I love that tweak, it beats iOS 10 raise to wake feature because you just need to rest your finger on the home button to wake it up. Also, you don’t need to press the home button ever again (or the lock button, for that matter), which even beats iPhone 7 and their annoying vibration button-thingy. It’s hard to think about upgrading to iOS 10 when there’s so much to lose in terms of convenience. Mallowigi Jailbreak puts a heavy burden on the phone: slowness, battery drain, crashes, bugs and unnecessary jailbreak detection by scumbag developers, but still a non-jb iphone lacks a lot of features that should be canon: – Callbar – SwipeSelection – Control Center customization – BioProtect (for theft protection) – iTouchSecure (autofills passwords with TouchID) – Activator (though I agree it is too “advanced” for “dumb phone users”) And last but not least: icon customization! I don’t know why, since ios 4 and the introduction of themes by the jailbreak community, iOS still doesn’t allow users to download theme packs! And it’s not Siri customization or iMessage copy-paste-from-messenger that will make me change my mind/ But still slowliness and crashes are a pain in the ass 🙁 mersc If you have slowness and crashes you need to uninstall the offending tweaks and find alternatives. I have 40+ tweaks and no issues. mersc NEVER EVER update unless JB is ready. Chris Owen I have to say, iOS 10 has been very stable and smooth on my iPhone 6 I’ve had no issues since I updated last night. Loops I will as soon as pangu comes out with a jailbreak for iOS10. Xee Same T. Allen I second that. Obada Essa Exactly! Diego Milano Exactly, I never ever hesitated. Serban Tried the beta, cute and all, but no point in upgrading without a JB. Diego Milano Totally agreed! Mallowigi Don’t know, there are not much improvements since 9.3.3 that requires me to update Ds I will when I get my 7+… until then I’m staying jailbroken. Xee Same again. T. Allen I also second that. Rowan09 When you get your 7+ you’ll have to upgrade your phone first. I had issues last year trying to use a backup from an old OS with the now current 6S Plus. T. Allen Yep. Definitely prepred to that…..once it has been confirmed a working jailbreak for iOS 10 is on the street. Otherwise, gonna stay right where I’m at. Cones1r I third that!!! L J YES AND IT”S AWESOMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE Sohail Wahab Check the lock and keyboard sound please. Is it low for you too? Agneev Mukherjee Way low… Sylvan Feghali I agree ! Sohail Wahab I love it, some of the things that I wanted from jailbreak community is implemented. The only thing that I anticipated was a loud lock and keyboard sound. Which will probably get after a jailbreak. Diego Milano What has been implemented from the jailbreak scene? john snow On iOS 10 since 2nd beta Sohail Wahab How did the lock and key sound evolved and how is it now? john snow Loved the firts change of lock sound with taptic feedback CaptainHappy Wish they would include it as an option at least. I wonder if they were just testing a button press with haptic feedback ahead of introducing the new home button. Julio Hernandez I’ll hold out until we get a jailbreak on iOS 10. VideoPane, noslowanimations, Eclipse 3 and AdBlocker are more important to me than iOS 10 Guy I use VideoPane daily. This is one feature iOS 10 still missing. Austin i would love to, but i never put the old phones on the new software. i have to stick it out until friday. Guy Used iOS 10 beta up to beta 4. Downgraded to jailbreak and glad I did so. Bradley Hines Staying on 9.3.3 jailbroken with no bugs and every tweak I could possibly want, no reason to upgrade, why go to new buggy OS w/ no jb? I’ll wait till its stable and there’s a jb. Diego Milano I can’t agree more, except I can’t tell if it’s buggy or not, the thing is- I DON’T EVEN CARE if it isn’t! I’m staying jailbroken, period! 😀 Apple❤️ stock with jailbreak port87 keeping jailbreak till then. cant give up unlimited spotify (spotilife), free tethering (tetherme), youtube downloading and background play (youtube++), springboard customizations ( mikoto, hidemeX, folderenhancer, winterboard etc) no ads on certain apps (minimal hosts blocker), downloader for snapchat (phantom), basically I cant give up customizing my phone. Diego Milano What is this Spotilife tweak all about? It’s not on the BigBoss repo. Jayy Agreed 100% Blip dude Staying Jailbroken, so I will stick to iOS 9.3(.2) for the time being. Rondog I did on my ipad but not on my iphone as I don’t want to lose my jailbreak. As far as my ipad on ios10 I was just curious to see if we get a jailbreak for it any time soon. If not I’ll downgrade back to 9.3.5, because I don’t really care for the changes on ios 10. I’ve always had my idevices on a jailbreak and looking the way I WANT them not how Apple wants them to look, never cared for the stock look. Waiting on a JAILBREAK for ios10. chuckisbusy How is iOS 10 running on the iPhone 6 plus, anyone?? Osiala Just as good as iOS 9. chuckisbusy Just as snappy, no lag?? Osiala I don’t think there is any lag, but if you upgrade and you don’t like it, you can still downgrade. CaptainHappy Feels snappier if anything. Animations are quicker for opening/closing apps and folders etc.. Also, small thing, but if you open an app by mistake you can press home and get back to the home screen before the app finishes opening – much better than iOS9 and having to wait to for the app to load. David Gow No worries Budz Camacho Smooth Im loving it . Better than IOS 9 IMO mersc But not better than ios 9 jailbroken Budz Camacho I had 9.3.3 jailbreak but I gave it up to have IOS 10. I’ll wait till the IOS 10 JB tool Cristian Meneses Same here, smoothly and without problems David Ruiz First day after the update: working good on iPhone 5C. Notice a little less battery life, but is smooth and didnt have a crash or anything bad yet. Is better than expected and I like the new font and loved the widgets! CAIO MARIZ® Amazing Job, Mr Cook, iOS 10 flies on iPhone 6! David Gow My debit card won’t take for Apple Pay. In iOS 9 I was able too but not now Millticket well, 1 day after the release the download is still slow af here, and no it’s not my net Jayy I’m not ready to give up my untethed iOS 9.0.2 jailbreakers yet! Agneev Mukherjee I miss my iOS 9.3.3 jailbreak now… Jayy Which is why I haven’t updated yet, I knew for a fact I’d miss a lot of features! Adam Ordered 7 so next week will get iOS 10. My 6 stays jb for now – can’t live without swipe selection Rowan09 Once you get a phone with force touch you’ll forget about it. Adam WOW didn’t know that – great news 🙂 thanks Diego Milano This isn’t entirely true, you’ll see why when the time comes… 🙂 samyg Was on iOS 9.0.2 (JB), backed up to iCloud, then restored to iOS 10 IPSW via iTunes. There was no option to restore from iCloud on iOS 10 first boot. Restored to 9.3.5, still no option to restore. Erased all content and settings and then restored from iCloud. More than half my apps just disappeared. Some were restored. Worst of all, my SwiftKey app wasn’t restored, and I’ve lost my whole custom dictionary of stuff that I type. Extremely irritating ordeal. Stick to iTunes backups, y’all. iCloud seems to suck. Rowan09 The problem is you were on a jailbroken OS for some reason iCloud doesn’t play well with backing up from a jailbroken OS from my experience to a major update. Bjones331 Sure didn’t. I have an iPhone 5s on 8.4 jailbroken. Since my phone has age on it I’m not going to update. Chan Crockett I’ve had beta for forever. its amazing locomambo only will do it IF there is a jailbreak for ios 10..waited way too long for 9.2 – 9.3.3 jailbreak. not falling for that again..i just wait for tweaks that simulates ios 10 new features. LimboMan Anyone else experiencing a very warm phone after the update to 10? Both mine (SE) and my brother’s (6s) experienced a warm handset at idle after iOS10 Mark Swain Jailbreak has gone, I updated last night, after restoring to 9.3.5 via .ispw, then restored to iOS10 via .ispw. I am loving iOS10!! Messages! TwinSon I’ve been getting my ass whooped in Chess on iMessage all morning. So yes, I upgraded to iOS 10. Diego Milano I wonder if any malware may get its way via this new iMessage app doorway. Jerry Not going to upgrade my 6s because its worth more money jailbroken so I have to wait for my i7 to try ios10 Rowan09 Really people pay more for jailbroken phones? Jerry Yeah especially since the jailbreaks are rare now Anthony Bouchard Yes, and that’s why Saurik released Cydia Eraser. HardTakeR good update ! Budz Camacho I already have a GM and its the same build , I’ll wait till The next build 🙂 Sylvan Feghali I did update from 9.02 because the jailbreak messed up my iphone so bad and my battery was dying within hours. Honestly i dont regret it because jailbreak is almost irrelevant for me now ,am just saying mersc You’re JBing wrong. Rowan09 I love it. I updated yesterday and it’s a huge upgrade. I jailbreak my devices for ifile and movie apps like Kodi and movie box. I can side load Kodi and if I can find a deb movie box file I can do the same for movie box. However I have CB Online and cinemabox when they were snuck unto the App Store, so my movie, tv show and anime needs are met. All I need now is a file explorer and I’ll be great. Andres Torres I lost my jailbreak, so I ultimately decided to update to iOS 10. Other than the animation lag, it runs well on my iPhone 6. Max Rojas Im on ios 10 GM, anyone noticing battery dying faster than usual? JulianZH of course, no point to keep using old os. mersc lol… wondering why you’re on a JBing website. PhoneTechJay I was going to do it honestly, My Pc didn’t want me too be cause on September 13th it gave me and MBR Error 1.. Stupid windows… It literally happened a few hours before the update went live. Ill be keeping the Jailbreak for a little longer. Diego Milano How come iDB never comes up with the one most of us jailbreake users will opt to which is, “I will wait for the iOS 10 jailbreak to become available to upgrade”? 🙂 Wesh holding out for jb. Im sure there will be a boost in adoption rate when one hits the scene 🙂 Kunal Aggarwal I upgraded to iOS 10 doing a complete restore on my iPhone 6S Plus. I turned on Rest to Unlock. Unlocking the phone seems so slow now! It takes about a second or two to Unlock the device. Anyone else facing the same issue? Please help! Touch ID seems to be working fine, in fingerprint settings, I can see my finger getting detected instantly! But unlocking takes two seconds. Tried everything, restarting, re-registering fingerprints, etc. Mark S No jailbreak, no update. It’s as simple as that. TonyVee73 I’ll update as soon s a Jailbreak is available. I was on 8.4 until the 9.3.3 jailbreak was released so I can wait. Leslie Bee I’ll consider not jailbreaking when Apple implements Activator, BioLockdown, Cloaky, iTouchSecure, Springtomize, and SwipeSelection. I can’t believe they’ve never implemented SwipeSelection. The default typing interface in iOS is total appcray. NewYorkCityBoy I will once the JB hits.   Search Connect with iDownloadBlog Facebook Become a fan RSS Get the latest news YouTube Watch Us Twitter Stay up to date Newsletter News delivered to you Google+ Add us to your circle   The most recent headlines How to show the storage drive icon on your Mac desktop How to mention someone in your Instagram story MacBook Pro with Touch Bar now available for in-store pickup Get up to $200 off the new MacBook Pro + no tax outside NY Where the Apple Car is going   The latest jailbreak news Jailbreak tweaks of the week: EmojiSuggest, PasswordRecovery, & more… EmojiSuggest brings iOS 10-like emoji suggestions to the predictive keyboard WiJoin lets you know what Wi-Fi network you’re connected to PasswordRecovery stores passwords and recovers them when you forget them NCTextColor lets you add vibrancy to Notification Center iDownloadBlog           iDownloadblog.com About About Advertise Contact Keep in Touch Twitter Facebook RSS Feed Newsletter Push Notifications Podcasts Let's Talk iOS Let's Talk Jailbreak Site Stuff Disclosure Privacy Policy   Copyright iDownloadBlog 2016.
