The AirPods automatically update to the latest software when the earbuds are charging in the AirPods Case and close to a paired device. The new firmware does not appear to contain any new front-facing features. There is no onscreen alert or notification that an update has taken place. You can however verify if your AirPods are up-to-date by checking the AirPods firmware version number in Settings on an iPhone … With your AirPods paired, open the Settings app on the connected iPhone or iPad. Go to the General -> About menu and scroll down. There will be a row labelled AirPods that shows up dynamically if the earbuds are connected. Tap into this to see the hardware details including the firmware version and other device metadata such as the unique serial number. If you check your AirPods and find they have not yet updated to the latest 3.5.1 version, there is not much to do apart from putting the AirPods in their case to charge and wait. That being said, the update does not appear to include any major changes so there’s not really a need to rush. Subscribe to 9to5Mac for more videos We’ll update the post if we notice anything new with AirPods running the latest version. After updating, some users have noticed instability with the Bluetooth pairing. It appears the presence of new firmware can confuse connected Macs and iOS devices temporarily. If you encounter this problem, unpair the AirPods explicitly in Bluetooth settings and reset. In terms of the hardware itself, the Apple AirPods continue to be very popular and are out of stock at most retailers. eBay scalpers are still selling them at hefty premiums.

It is also nearing Apple stock’s all time high of $135. Last night, Apple reported all-time record earnings with revenue topping $78.4 billion, beating analysts consensus. The stock market investors appear to be pleased with Apple’s results; AAPL stock opened up more than 5%. The company reported sales of 78.3 million iPhones, 13 million iPads and 5.3 million Macs. Spiking at over $127 this morning, Apple stock is once again close to its all-time high of $135 after rallying following Trump’s presidential victory. The company announced that the holiday quarter, fiscal Q1 2017 or calendar Q4 2016, all-time revenue records for its iPhone, Services, Mac and Apple Watch businesses. Apple’s latest round of product releases featuring iPhone 7, Apple Watch Series 2, and the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar appear to have been a hit. The average selling price of the 78 million iPhones Apple sold was higher than ever before, at $695. On the earnings call, Tim Cook said that the product mix of iPhone 7 Plus compared to iPhone 7 was skewed towards the larger size more so than in the past. The higher starting price of the iPhone 7 Plus pushed overall iPhone ASP upwards. Mac revenue was a nudge higher than the year-ago quarter but Apple said its new Mac, the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, was supply constrained throughout and saw high demand. Apple does not disclose specific numbers for Apple Watch however Cook did announce record revenue and unit sales for the product. Apple’s services businesses also continued to show strong growth, reporting $7.2 billion in revenues. Services constitutes things like Apple Pay, Apple Music, iCloud Storage upgrades and more. On the call, Apple announced a new target to double the size of the Services business over the next four years, implying it expects the division to continue to see 20% YOY growth. Investors are clearly encouraged with these numbers although Apple’s guidance for the current quarter was not above consensus. Apple is predicting revenue between $51.5 and $53.5 billion. This would beat the year-ago quarter (Q2 2016 saw $50.6 billion revenue) and means Apple is not expecting negative revenue growth for the foreseeable future. The company will report next quarter’s earnings sometime in April. blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

That was despite, as IDC notes, a first full year of decline for iPhone with a 7% drop year-over-year for 2016: “This was a year that brought us the first down year for iPhone, yet Apple closed out the holiday quarter by surpassing Samsung for the top spot in the smartphone industry. We also witnessed year-over-year declines in some emerging regions like the Middle East and Latin America where high growth was expected. To round it all off, we now have a three horse race at the top of the market as Huawei cracked the double-digit share mark for the first time ever.” Apple’s iPhone sales of 78.3 million units in the fourth quarter was a 4.7% year-over-year increase for the quarter, but Apple also benefited from a rare 14th week this year that it noted during its earnings call with investors yesterday. While Apple mentioned the 14th week, giving the company an extra week of iPhone sales that could have potentially accounted for the record units shipped, the company said the added benefit was offset by channel inventory growth, a stronger U.S. dollar, and year-ago revenue that included a 1-off $584 million patent infringement payment. “We had the benefit of a 14th week during the quarter this year, but this was offset by four factors. First, this year we grew China inventory significantly less than a year ago. Second, iPhone 7 launched earlier in the September quarter compared to the iPhone 6s launch the previous year, creating a more difficult comparison for the December quarter this year. Third, the stronger U.S. dollar affected total revenue growth this year by 100 basis points. And fourth, our year-ago revenue included the benefit of a one-off $548 million patent infringement payment. Also, strong customer interest left us in supply/demand imbalance for several of our products throughout the quarter this year.” Samsung, in comparison, shipped 77.5 million units during the important holiday quarter, a 5.2% drop from the same quarter last year. And third-place Huawei shipped 45.4 million, accounting for a 38.6% year-over-year increase in sales as other Chinese manufacturers OPPO and vivo took the 4th and 5th spots both with over 100% year-over-year increases. But while Apple surpassed Samsung in the fourth quarter, Samsung comes out on top for 2016 overall with 311.4 million units shipped versus 215.4 million for Apple in second position and 139.3 million for Huawei in third: IDC notes in its full report that Samsung’s decline in the fourth quarter meant its worldwide market share dropped below 20% for the first time in four years.

According to the report, the new Mac chip may be used for low-power tasks that currently rely on Intel’s chip to process. The report does not detail a full switch to ARM chips for the Mac, however, noting that Macs will still rely on Intel processors unlike iPhones and iPads which are totally ARM-based. Issues with Intel preparing new chips in time to be used with Macs has fueled speculation that Apple could eventually switch to ARM-based chips in the future. For now, the new ARM chip would potentially be used for dedicated tasks like maintaining background app activity which could preserve battery life. The updated part, internally codenamed T310, would handle some of the computer’s low-power mode functionality, they said. […] Apple engineers are planning to offload the Mac’s low-power mode, a feature marketed as “Power Nap,” to the next-generation ARM-based chip. The report specifies that Apple may be planning to introduce the new chip in updated MacBook Pros as soon as this year. The new chip may first become available in an upgraded version of the MacBook Pro laptop planned for later this year, the people said. Relying on a dedicated chip for specific tasks could be a benefit to battery life which has been an issue with Apple’s latest MacBooks Pro models. iPhone, for example, features a dedicated co-processor that focuses on step tracking and listening for the ‘Hey Siri’ voice prompt. Apple already includes a custom ARM chip called the T1 with its latest MacBook Pro models with Touch Bar and Touch ID. Separately, new models of the MacBook Pro are expected to take advantage of Intel’s new Kaby Lake generation chips and and step up to 32 GB of RAM on notebooks which has not yet been an option. Apple is also expected to be preparing new iMacs with updated specs including USB-C after the last refresh occurred over a year ago.

The Taiwanese company Wistron Corp. will be doing the on ground assembly for Apple in Karnataka. The iPhones manufactured in India will be meant for the Indian market only and will not be exported at the time. Apple in terms of manufacture has demanded a 15 year tax holiday from the government to start the manufacturing process, which is still being negotiated. Apple will soon after launch Apple owned and operated Apple Stores in several major metropolitan cities of India including Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Chandigarh and Ahmadabad. Apple Stores will bring about reforms in Apple Care services being offered in India which suffer due to poor operation standards of Apple Resellers. It is safe to say that Apple’s next iPhone, which is also the 10th Anniversary iPhone will be assembled right here in India for the Indian market. Whether this will affect pricing and quality standards is yet unknown.   likethis What's your reaction?

The US giant has not confirmed the move, but chief executive Tim Cook said this week the company intended to "invest significantly" in India, where a pick-up in the economy provides ample opportunity for growth. "We have an understanding with Apple and we expect them to start manufacturing in Karnataka by the end of April," Priyank Kharge, minister of information technology and biotechnology in southern Karnataka state, told AFP. He said the new operation would likely assemble iPhones for the domestic market. Apple has only a two-percent share of the Indian market, well behind rival Samsung on 23 percent, according to research firm Canalys. However, last year it had 48 percent of the premium sector in which phones sell for $450 and above. Experts said manufacturing locally would reduce the company's costs and enable it to lower prices. "They're eager to be here because they've identified India as a strategic focus market," said Jaideep Mehta of research firm IDC. "They had a fantastic 2016 in India and shipped more two million devices to India, and now they're looking to ultimately manufacture here as that gives them more flexibility to respond to market changes." Apple currently sells its phones in India through third-party retailers. It is eager to open its own stores but Indian law would require it to procure 30 percent of the components of its products locally. It is not clear whether the Karnataka plans would help it clear that hurdle. Reports in Indian media said Wistron Corp., a Taiwanese electronics manufacturer, was lined up to assemble iPhones at a plant on the outskirts of tech hub Bangalore. Apple outsources all its manufacturing globally. Analysts said that if confirmed the move would be a coup for India's government, which has been trying to persuade foreign companies to manufacture in the country.

Twitter Facebook Apple to start assembling iPhones in Bangalore by April The company aims to lower the cost of its phones by making them locally John Ribeiro (IDG News Service) 03 February, 2017 18:58 - - - - print email Comments Apple plans to start assembling the iPhone in Bangalore by end April under a contract manufacturing arrangement with Taiwan's Wistron. The move by the company comes even as it awaits approval from the federal government for some of its proposals for lowering the import duties on components and for creating an ecosystem of local manufacturers who can supply components for the smartphones, according to sources close to the situation. The Karnataka state, of which Bangalore is the capital, has announced Apple’s intentions to make the iPhone in the city. Priyank Kharge, state minister for information technology, confirmed on telephone that the company had been cleared to make the phones in Bangalore and said it was a validation of the state's industry-friendly policies. Having a leading tech company making its products in the state could also have spin-off benefits in terms of app development and work in the area of artificial intelligence by the state's highly-skilled manpower, he added. Apple announced last year the setting up of a facility in Bangalore to assist developers on best practices and improved app design around its iOS platform. The company has not been extended any special incentives by the state to assemble the phones in Bangalore, Kharge said. Apple did not immediately comment. The company has been planning to make its phones in India as well as set up its own retail stores in the country to address the booming local market, which is expected to see higher demand for Apple devices because of the rollout of 4G networks. iPhone sales were up over 50 percent in the country in fiscal 2016 over the previous year.  Getting the price down by local assembly is critical for Apple as the market is very price-sensitive. In the third quarter, Samsung Electronics, followed by Chinese and Indian brands like Lenovo and Micromax, led the Indian smartphone market, according to IDC estimates, largely because they have been able to deliver their products at various price points. Apple has tried to get the Indian federal government to allow it to import refurbished phones that it could sell at low prices, but that proposal has run into criticism from some sections of government because of the environmental consequences of bringing into the country end-of-life products. Assembling phones in Bangalore would help Apple meet local sourcing rules for single-brand, foreign-owned retail stores, thus giving momentum to this other plan of the company.

According to Brand Finance’s Global 500 2017 report, Google’s brand value surged as much as 24 percent last year to $109.4 billion. Cupertino-based Apple’s brand value, however, fell 27 percent to $107.1 billion, and it dropped to the second place. “Google remains largely unchallenged in its core search business, which is the mainstay of its advertising income,” the report said. The Google brand benefitted from the numero uno position it enjoys in the maps space, and its other products—Android, Chrome and YouTube—also retained their individual brand value. However, the report also mentioned that Google is attracting scrutiny over the erosion of personal privacy and potential monopolistic behaviour, and that a mono-branded approach here may not work in its favour. Google had made attempts to move away from this approach in 2015 when it went through corporate restructuring and became a division of new parent Alphabet. Diversifying its brand portfolio helps Alphabet avoid excessive scale and divert regulatory attention, mentioned the report. On the other hand, Apple has “failed to maintain its technological advantage and repeatedly disillusioned its advocates with tweaks when material changes were expected,” the report said. Other top brands Tech brands continued to enjoy superlative brand value, followed by the banking sector, telecommunications, retail and auto. E-commerce firm Amazon was third ($106.4 billion) on the list, followed by telecom company AT&T ($87 billion), which came in fourth. The fifth position was held by Microsoft ($76.3 billion), followed by South Korean electronics giant Samsung, telecom firm Verizon, US-based retailer Walmart and social media company Facebook. Amazon’s brand value grew 53% in 2016 as it continued capturing market share in several geographies. Facebook saw 82% growth in brand value, but Chinese tech brands Alibaba, WeChat and Tencent grew faster at 94%, 103% and 124%, respectively. Like this report?

Appearing before the Oireachtas Finance Committee, Mr Noonan said he believed the EU Apple case amounted to “political input” and undermined the certainty about business taxes here. Committee senators and TDs quizzed the minister about why Ireland is appealing the EU case and what authorities knew here about “stateless companies” operating with little or no tax obligations. Mr Noonan said the appeal could take four years. So far €1.8m has been spent on lawyers fees in the appeal but there is no idea what the final bill could be. He told members there was “political input” in Europe into the Apple case but said this was because of the “mismatch” of tax rules between different jurisdictions, which is now being addressed. He said he didn’t think the European Commission were “having a go” at Ireland by taking the case, nonetheless, he said, “I don’t think Apple worldwide are paying sufficient tax.” However, the Apple ruling, released last August by Brussels, had undermined certainty here and “corporation tax offerings” here. This would remain so until the case is decided as there will be “uncertainty” [for companies] about what their tax liabilities might be. The case though had not affected investment here, he added. Mr Noonan was repeatedly questioned by Sinn Féin TD Pearse Doherty about where the intellectual property rights of Apple existed or belonged. The minister though refused to be drawn on this, saying it would form the “cornerstone” of Ireland’s appeal. AAA-PBP TD Richard Boyd Barrett argued that it had never been credible to let the profits go to an office that did not essentially exist and Irish people wanted to know why we were not taking the €13bn and instead giving millions of euro to lawyers to fight the tax payment. Mr Noonan insisted Ireland had got the right amount of taxes due to it from Apple. He insisted Brussels had “misused” its state aid powers by taking the Apple case against Ireland. “They [Apple] fully paid tax on profits generated in Ireland.” Meanwhile, the head of Revenue Niall Cody has refused to say when Ireland became aware that Apple was operating a so-called ‘stateless company’, saying this was because of tax “confidentiality”. The European Commission this week told the committee it began investigating Apple’s tax affairs here after the firm told a US senate hearing in 2013 it had arrangements with Ireland. Mr Cody declined to comment for tax “confidentiality” reasons, but he did say: “The idea nobody knew in the US until the senate hearing is just not true.” Mr Doherty accused Revenue of turning a “blind eye” on the situation for many years and also suggested officials may have known about any special tax arrangements as early as the 1990s.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 3 February 2017 | MYT 4:07 PM Apple to build iPhone in India this year: official Significant step: Apple currently sells its phones in India through third-party retailers, a scenario it is eager to change by setting up its own iconic Apple Stores – something the Karnataka plans might help it to achieve. — Reuters NEW DELHI: Apple is to start making iPhones in India this year, a local government official said Feb 3, as the firm looks to tap a booming middle class as sales in China slow.  The US giant has not confirmed the move, but chief executive Tim Cook said this week the company intended to “invest significantly” in India, where a pick-up in the economy provides ample opportunity for growth.  ”We have an understanding with Apple and we expect them to start manufacturing in Karnataka by the end of April,” Priyank Kharge, minister of information technology and biotechnology in southern Karnataka state, told AFP.  He said the new operation would likely assemble iPhones for the domestic market.  Apple has only a 2% share of the Indian market, well behind rival Samsung on 23%, according to research firm Canalys.  However, last year it had 48% of the premium sector in which phones sell for US$450 (RM1,991) and above.  Experts said manufacturing locally would reduce the company’s costs and enable it to lower prices.  ”They’re eager to be here because they’ve identified India as a strategic focus market,” said Jaideep Mehta of research firm IDC.  ”They had a fantastic 2016 in India and shipped more two million devices to India, and now they’re looking to ultimately manufacture here as that gives them more flexibility to respond to market changes.”  Apple currently sells its phones in India through third-party retailers.  It is eager to open its own stores but Indian law would require it to procure 30% of the components of its products locally.   It is not clear whether the Karnataka plans would help it clear that hurdle.  Reports in Indian media said Wistron Corp, a Taiwanese electronics manufacturer, was lined up to assemble iPhones at a plant on the outskirts of tech hub Bangalore.  Apple outsources all its manufacturing globally.   Analysts said that if confirmed the move would be a coup for India’s government, which has been trying to persuade foreign companies to manufacture in the country. — AFP Tags / Keywords: Foreign News , Corporate News , Life & Style , Technology , Government , Analyst Reports You May Be Interested Under attack from hackers, UK isn’t hiring staff fast enough Facebook, Microsoft said to circulate immigration open letter Credit card thieves move online as chips cut in-store fraud Microsoft asks for exception programme on Trump orders Here’s Apple’s challenge in India Indian IT firms to meet Trump officials on visa reform concerns Others Also Read Pietersen fined for on-air criticism of BBL umpire Kemuning folk want authorities to find culprit causing smog in neighbourhood Britain says Russia is trying to undermine West by 'weaponising misinformation' advertisement Latest News Honda Malaysia recalls 2012 year models to replace inflators Yinson expects earnings from converted FPSO by Q3 2017 Apple to build iPhone in India this year: official Amazon projects spending that concerns investors watching profit Top foreign and local stories at 4pm Most Viewed in Tech Is it time to say ‘goodbye’ to Google Allo?

Samsung and Apple together consumed $61.7 billion of semiconductors in 2016 -- an increase of $0.4 billion from 2015. "This is the sixth consecutive year that Samsung Electronics and Apple have topped the semiconductor consumption table," Masatsune Yamaji, principal research analyst at Gartner, said in a statement. "While both companies continue to exert considerable influence on technology and price trends for the wider semiconductor industry, their impact has lessened due to falling expectations for future growth," Masatsune added. Although Samsung Electronics experienced intense competition from Chinese original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in various markets, including smartphones, LCD TV and LCD panel through 2016, the company increased its design total available market (TAM) and came back as the global top design TAM company in 2016 with 9.3 per cent share. Apple decreased its design TAM in 2016 ending the year with 8.8 per cent share of the market. The iPad did not sell well through 2016 and Apple also lost market share in the PC market, Gartner added. Nine of the top 10 companies in 2015 remained in the top 10 in 2016. Cisco Systems dropped out of the top 10 in 2016 to be replaced by Chinese smartphone OEM, BBK Electronics. The top 10 now include four companies from the US, three companies from China, two from South Korea and one from Japan. This is the first time that three Chinese companies have ranked in the top 10. --IANS sku/na/vm Reblog Share Tweet Share What to read next Kuwait follows Trump's cue, imposes visa ban on citizens from five Muslim-majority countries, including Pakistan International Business Times See how freelancers keep more of their money TurboTax Self-EmployedSponsored Watch: Local woman beaten mercilessly by village Sarpanch Ani Pakistan may be added to the list of countries whose citizens are barred from entering the US Catch News Anna Hazare files complaint with Mumbai police alleging scam in sale of sugar factories India Today 7 Outrageous Cards For Those With Excellent Credit NextAdvisorSponsored Kanpur building collapse: 2 more bodies recovered, death toll reaches 8 Ani India vs England 2016/17: Suresh Raina's six injures 6-year old boy during the T20 match in Bangalore Sportskeeda You may have to pay more for rail journeys.

But despite ongoing renovations, there wasn’t too much information available with regards to the company’s plans on the iconic store. Thankfully, Bloomberg earlier revealed more details on Apple’s plans, citing the company intends to create a store with “more than double the size” of its location. Today, Boston Properties gave an earnings call where they disclosed Apple’s plans to expand the property from 32,000 to 77,000 square feet. The REIT company co-owns the General Motors Building which will house the upcoming glass cube retail store of Apple. During the call, company president Douglas Linde shares how he refers to Apple as a “mystery tenant” they had been discussing for more than a year. When asked about their plans for the retail store, Apple kept mum about it. A spokesperson, however, gave some clues on what to expect from the controversial location saying it was “incredible” and that the customers would “enjoy new services and experiences in much larger space.” It’s pretty interesting to know Apple is continuing its plans with its iconic Fifth Avenue store, especially since the shopping district has been in a bit of a turmoil over the past few months. A number of establishments have reported vacancies brought about by the high rent, traffic, and lower sales. Part of this can be attributed to newly proclaimed President Donald Trump, who resides at the Trump Tower, a mere couple of blocks away from the district. As a result, the area has experienced a rise in traffic congestion and areas limited to pedestrians. Back in January, Apple announced that they would be temporarily closing their Fifth Avenue retail store. But now that Apple is upping its initial plans on property space, it could be likely we’ll see the same design elements that can be found at its newly renovated retail store in San Francisco’s Union Square. Whatever Apple’s plans are for the future of the Fifth Avenue location, we’re sure everyone’s just as excited to witness it when it finally opens.

Company Closer To Setting Up Manufacturing Plant After Discussions With Government By Rishabh Jain On 02/03/17 AT 3:11 AM Close Apple’s back and forth discussions with the Indian government about setting up manufacturing operations in the country seem close to fruition. The company had met government officials on Jan. 25 to discuss plans to start manufacturing devices in the country. “Apple’s decision on initial manufacturing in Bengaluru has further enhanced the reputation of Bengaluru as the most preferred destination for foreign investment and further validation of the State Government Policies aimed at fostering manufacturing, innovation and investments in Karnataka,” reported Forbes Thursday, citing a statement released by infotech department of the government of the Indian state of Karnataka.  Despite the statement, Apple has stopped short of confirming manufacturing plans in India. The company reiterated its statement given to Reuters on Jan. 25 that discussions are ongoing.  “We've been working hard to develop our operations in India and are proud to deliver the best products and services in the world to our customers here. We appreciate the constructive and open dialogue we've had with government about further expanding our local operations,” the company said. As manufacturing in China gets expensive,  Apple has been looking at setting up manufaturing units in other countires — India being its most preferred choice for the rising smartphone demand in the country.  Other obvious advantages being the availability of skilled and cheap labor, economical manufacturing costs and IT expertise. However, unlike China, India has rejected Apple’s demand for special concessions such as a 15-year tax holiday. Apple has also been slightly wary about the Indian government's requirements of printing detailed packaging information on the back of the device.  Related Stories Apple, India Officials To Meet Next Week Made In America iPhones To Cost More The Indian government has already given the company a three-year grace period from the stipulation that foreign companies must buy at leat 30 percent of their components from within the country, but Apple is still pushing for import and manufacturing duties for its devices and components.  Apple does not manufacture its phones; rather it relies on manufacturers such as Foxconn for the same. The Taiwanese manufacturer Wistron is expected to make the phones in Bengaluru. India is one of the world’s biggest smartphone markets and has a substantial demand for Apple products. iPhone sales in India were up 50 percent year on year in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 in earnings results announced on Jan. 31.  Many brands including Xiaomi, Vivo among others have already set up operations  in the country.

Here are a few things we think prospective iPhone 8 buyers need to know as we push closer to the iPhone 8 release later this year. Advertisement As we push into 2017 we’re starting to hear about the phones that will replace the popular devices from last year. Names like the Samsung Galaxy S8, Galaxy Note 8, and LG G6  are starting to popup as we close in on key events and dates. While many consumers have their eye on this year’s Android devices, others are interested in Apple’s rumored iPhone 8. The iPhone 8 is the rumored successor to the iPhone 7. Advertisement iPhone 8 rumors are emerging at a steady pace as we push away from September’s iPhone 7 release. The likely successor to Apple’s current flagship models are probably months away but we’re already seeing potential features firm up. Advertisement The 10th anniversary iPhone is rumored to have a new design, improved 3D Touch, wireless charging, and a new color option. Unsurprisingly, many people are asking us when they’ll be able to get their hands on the new device. Apple hasn’t confirmed an iPhone 8 release date but there are a few things to know about the release as rumors pickup and as iPhone 8 competitors start emerging from the shadows. iPhone 8 Release Date iPhone 8 release date rumors are scarce but it’s easy to predict when we’ll probably see the next iPhone launch. Apple is reportedly testing new iPhone models and the company’s suppliers are gearing up to supply the phone’s various components. The iPhone 8 release date will likely land in September. Advertisement At this point, you can expect the iPhone 8 to emerge in September. We don’t have exact dates to share but this is the most logical window for Apple and its next iPhone model. The iPhone Upgrade Program, which promises consumers a “new iPhone every year,” also locks the company into an annual release in and around the same time. iPhone 8 Name We, and many others, are calling the next iPhone the iPhone 8. While there’s a chance Apple will jump from iPhone 7 to iPhone 8, there’s also a chance it will be called something else. Japanese site Mac Otakara, a solid source for Apple iPhone rumors, believes Apple will go with “iPhone 7s” and “iPhone 7 Plus” as the names of this year’s models. “S” iPhone models typically offer incremental changes and look similar to the model from the previous year. The iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s are the most recent examples. Advertisement So, as we push toward the release, note that rumors about “iPhone 8” and “iPhone 7s” could be talking about the same phone. iPhone 8 Design This year’s iPhone is rumored to have a brand new design. Well-known analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, another credible source, claims that Apple will ditch the aluminum design its been using since 2012 and shift to a glass-back. The glass back was last used with the iPhone 4s. iPhone 8 design rumors are still a bit flimsy but you can expect at least one holdover from the iPhone 7’s makeup. A redesign isn’t a given but don’t expect a headphone jack. Advertisement The iPhone 7 design ditched the popular 3.5mm headphone jack and we don’t expect Apple to look back. The iPhone 8 design will almost certainly ditch the headphone jack as well. So what does this mean for the iPhone 8 release? If you’re planning to buy the iPhone 8 later this year, it would be wise to avoid buying products that utilize the port. In other words, don’t invest any money into a pair of headphones that don’t feature Bluetooth support. They could become obsolete once you pickup your new phone later this year. iPhone 7 Deals You don’t have to wait for the iPhone 8 release to get a good iPhone 7 deal. We’ve seen a ton of iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus deals emerge in the months since launch and we expect to see plenty more in the first half of 2017. The “wait for the next iPhone to get a better deal on the current iPhone” mindset is outdated and you can save a ton of money right now. iPhone 8 Competitors As the iPhone 8 release gets closer it’ll be important to get familiar with the device’s various competitors. Some of these devices, like the iPhone 7, are already out on shelves. Others are still in development behind the scenes and will be released before the iPhone 8 arrives later this year. If you’re interested in the iPhone 8 release there are a few iPhone 8 competitors you should be paying attention to. The LG G6 flagship is expected to arrive in February with a powerful set of specs. and an improved design. It’s also expected to run Google’s Android Nougat operating system. Samsung is also cooking up a successor to the Galaxy S7, one of the best alternatives to the iPhone 6s and iPhone 7. Like the LG G6, the Samsung Galaxy S8 is expected to arrive in early 2017 with some major changes including large high-resolution displays, dual cameras, and tons of storage. Similar to what the next iPhone will offer. If its been a long time since you looked at the competition, many things have changed. You can see our updated list of reasons the iPhone is better and list of reasons why Android is better. 8 iPhone 8 Features We Want in 2017 New iPhone 8 Design to Enable Features   1 / 8 Everyone wants a new iPhone 8 design, but most people don't know what changes they actually want. We're leading off our iPhone 8 feature wishlist with a new iPhone 8 design because it is a key part of enabling new iPhone 8 features. After sticking with a very similar design for three years there is an expectation of major changes for the 2017 iPhone and here are the things we would love to see Apple do with a new design. Shrink the overall size of the iPhone 8 Plus without lowering the screen size. Apple could do this by shrinking the bezels on the sides and bottom of the iPhone some to offer a smaller overall package. Apple could choose to change where you use Touch ID and how the home button works in new ways to make this happen. We definitely don't want a phone that is slim just to be slim, especially not at the price of battery life, but there is something to be said about an iPhone 8 design that trims some fat. The Jet Black iPhone 7 feels different than all the other colors. While it is more susceptible to scratches it is easier to grip, which is something we can definitely see Apple add to the new iPhone 8. KGI Securities Analyst Ming-Chi Kou predicts the iPhone 8 design will look include an all glass front and back with stainless steel metal on the edges of premium models. This could come together for an iPhone 8 design that looks like a cross between the iPhone 4s and the Jet Black iPhone 7.   1 / 8 Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

The government of India has welcomed Apple’s proposed plans to start manufacturing iPhones there. In a post to Twitter, Priyank, Kharge the Minister for IT in the state of Karnataka – where initial manufacturing efforts would take place – praised the proposals as good news for India’s tech sector. “Apple’s intentions to make iPhones in Bengaluru will foster [a] cutting-edge technology ecosystem and supply chain development in the state,” Kharge wrote. Apple first hinted at the possibility of manufacturing in India after CEO Tim Cook met with PM Narendra Modi during a visit to the country last year. But it’s only in 2017 that the process has become formalised, as Apple executives met with Indian government officials back in January. Today, Apple utilises the services of several different manufacturing companies, the most prominent of which are Foxconn and Pegatron. Both of these are Taiwanese companies who outsource manufacturing operations to China through mainland factories. But India is an increasingly important market for China, with Apple shipping an impressive 2.6 million iPhones in the country last year – that’s a 62% share of premium phones sold in the country, according to Counterpoint. Speaking about future plans for India, Cook said: “We are in discussions on a number of things, including retail stores, and fully intend to invest significantly in the country and believe it’s a great place to be.” Related: iPhone 8 Watch: MWC 2017 – What to expect What would you like to see from Apple’s next iPhone?

Skip to content Fone Arena The Mobile Blog Menu Main Site Phones Gadgets About Media Coverage Advertising Contact Tip Us Twitter FB Youtube Tablet market sees 20.1% decline, Apple leads with 24.7% market share in Q4 2016 : IDC Tablet market continued to decline in Q4 16 which marked the ninth consecutive quarter that tablet shipments have seen a nose dive. According to preliminary data from the International Data Corporation (IDC) Worldwide Quarterly Tablet Tracker, vendors shipped 52.9 million tablets in the fourth quarter, which was a decline of 20.1% from the same quarter one year ago. Apple topped the market in Q4 by grabbing 24.7% market share and shipped 13.1 million units. IDC said the iPad Pro lineup made up only a small portion of overall shipments as the iPad Air 2 and Mini tablets continued to account for the majority of the shipments for Apple. For every 10 slate tablets shipped, Apple only sold 1 iPad Pro tablet. Samsung took the second spot capturing 15.1% market share on 8 million shipments, down -11.4% from the holiday quarter in 2015. Amazon and Lenovo came in third and fourth with market share of 6.9% and 6.3%. Ryan Reith, program vice president with IDC’s Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Device Trackers said, The sentiment around the tablet market continues to grow stale despite a lot of talk about vendors pivoting their product portfolios toward the detachable segment. Typical tablets without a dedicated keyboard, which IDC refers to as slate tablets, are continuing to lose relevancy across all regions and, as a result, we see the decline happening globally. We do see future growth in some emerging markets like the Middle East & Africa as well as Central & Eastern Europe with the sole catalysts being simplicity and low cost. Unfortunately for the industry these are the devices that don’t equate to large revenues. Jitesh Ubrani, senior research analyst with IDC’s Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Device Trackers said, The market continues to warm up to two-in-one devices, but we’re now getting to a point where the price and performance disparity between detachables and convertibles has started to narrow, and this added competition led to a dampening in the growth of detachable tablets. However, we expect this to be temporary as only two of the three major platforms have any significant hardware presence in the detachable market, and as the ecosystems are further refined with future updates and developer support. Shipments of 174.8 million units for the full year 2016 were down 15.6% compared to 2015, marking the second straight year of declining shipments.

The move by the company comes even as it awaits approval from the federal government for some of its proposals for lowering the import duties on components and for creating an ecosystem of local manufacturers who can supply components for the smartphones, according to sources close to the situation. The Karnataka state, of which Bangalore is the capital, has announced Apple’s intentions to make the iPhone in the city. Priyank Kharge, state minister for information technology, confirmed on telephone that the company had been cleared to make the phones in Bangalore and said it was a validation of the state's industry-friendly policies. Having a leading tech company making its products in the state could also have spin-off benefits in terms of app development and work in the area of artificial intelligence by the state's highly-skilled manpower, he added. Apple announced last year the setting up of a facility in Bangalore to assist developers on best practices and improved app design around its iOS platform. The company has not been extended any special incentives by the state to assemble the phones in Bangalore, Kharge said. Apple did not immediately comment. The company has been planning to make its phones in India as well as set up its own retail stores in the country to address the booming local market, which is expected to see higher demand for Apple devices because of the rollout of 4G networks. iPhone sales were up over 50 percent in the country in fiscal 2016 over the previous year.  Getting the price down by local assembly is critical for Apple as the market is very price-sensitive. In the third quarter, Samsung Electronics, followed by Chinese and Indian brands like Lenovo and Micromax, led the Indian smartphone market, according to IDC estimates, largely because they have been able to deliver their products at various price points. Apple has tried to get the Indian federal government to allow it to import refurbished phones that it could sell at low prices, but that proposal has run into criticism from some sections of government because of the environmental consequences of bringing into the country end-of-life products. Assembling phones in Bangalore would help Apple meet local sourcing rules for single-brand, foreign-owned retail stores, thus giving momentum to this other plan of the company.

Apple Readies Laser Polishing System for Ceramic iPhone GO Yes, a white ceramic iPhone seems to be on its way Feb 3, 2017 08:04 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  Rumor has it that Apple might be working on a ceramic version of the iPhone that could also be available in white, just like the Watch Series 2, and now more evidence seems to confirm that this is indeed the plan. Cupertino has recently patented what’s being described as a laser polishing technology that would be used on ceramic iPhones, although it’s not yet clear if there’s enough time for this new system to be employed for the 2017 model or not. A patent discovered by PatentlyApple describes a process that would essentially involve “polishing a ceramic component using a laser” and the final goal would be to “produce a polished surface.” The patent doesn’t specifically refer to the iPhone, so Apple could use it on several other products. Apple used ceramic on the Watch Series 2 launched last year, and it’s believed that the company wants to extend the use of the same material to more products, including the iPhone. This could allow the firm to improve certain features, such as cellular signal, and add new ones, including wireless charging, while also offering a more premium feeling and extra hardness to resist more powerful hits, shocks, and scratches. More expensive iPhone A ceramic iPhone would obviously be more expensive given the exquisite material, and this is also the case with the ceramic Watch Series 2 which costs $1,299. The same laser polishing technique can be used for other materials too, the patent states, including glass. It’s believed that glass would be one of the main materials used by Apple on this year’s iPhone generation, with the company reportedly working on building the new model with a glass body and a metal frame, similar to the iPhone 4. Unfortunately, however, a patent is by no means a confirmation that a certain product or technology is being implemented, although all signs seem to be pointing that Apple is more and more interested in building a ceramic iPhone. Expect more information to emerge in the coming months when leaks should also start making the rounds, as we get closer to the official fall 2017 release date of the new iPhone. #Apple#iPhone#ceramic#ceramic iPhone subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Google Adds QR Code Scanner to Chrome App for iPhones iPhone 8 Concept Shows Almost Bezel-Less Display and Dynamic Home Button iPhone 6 Plus Catches Fire on Nightstand, Awakens Sleeping Owner Apple Rolls Out AirPods Firmware 3.5.1 to Synchronized iPhones Zero-Day Windows Security Flaw Could Crash Systems, Cause BSODs Oops: Windows 10 Starts Going Down on Steam Microsoft Releases Windows 10 Mobile Build 15025 Avast Releases Three New Decryption Tools to Fight Ransomware Windows 10 Start Menu Redesigned with Project NEON Transparency Google Photos 2.8 Gets Redesigned UI and Changes to Device Folders iOS Cracking Tools Allegedly Stolen from Cellebrite Get Dumped Online by Hackers Windows Is Becoming a Bigger Threat for Apple on Tablets    Ceramic Apple Watch Series 2 new ios apps NeuroNation: Train your brain to improve your memory and focus with NeuroNation Flipagram: Create cool videos by mixing up your photos with music Timer+: Set up dozens of timers and control them all with ease Nutshell Camera: Create some pretty cool videos with Nutshell Camera IKEA Catalogue: Check out the IKEA Catalogue for more than just furniture Complete: Complete puts a social twist to your regular to-do list/ task manager WebMD Baby: WebMD Baby offers help in how to best tend to your baby Reader comments Google Adds QR Code Scanner to Chrome App for iPhones more on: Apple i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

B for Bengaluru. C for coming soon Written by Devjyot Ghoshal 1 hour ago Quartz india Apna Apple. (Reuters/Adnan Abidi) Share Written by Devjyot Ghoshal 1 hour ago Quartz india Made-in-India iPhones are coming. Ending months of breathless speculation, the Karnataka government has confirmed that Apple will begin assembling iPhones at a new facility in the southern Indian state. “Apple’s iPhones will be made in Bangalore and all devices will be targeted at the domestic market,” said Priyank Kharge, Karnataka’s information technology minister, according to Bloomberg. Quartz has written to Apple seeking comments, but hasn’t heard back yet. The Cupertino-based technology giant could initially start assembling the devices at a plant owned by Wistron Corp, a Taiwanese smartphone component maker and Apple partner, Reuters reported. Earlier this year, Wistron reportedly sought permission from the Karnataka government to expand its facility on the outskirts of Bengaluru. With sales slowing down in key markets, including in the West and China, India is turning out to be an increasingly important growth region for Apple. During October-December 2016, for instance, the company reported an “all-time record revenue” from India, the world’s fastest-growing smartphone market. “We are in discussions on a number of things (in India), including retail stores,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said in post-earnings call on Jan. 31, “and fully intend to invest significantly in the country and believe it’s a great place to be.” Apple has been looking to bolster its presence in India for some time now, with company executives engaging the government at the highest levels. In 2016, Cook himself had made a trip to India and met with prime minister Narendra Modi. To show for all its efforts, Apple now has the regulatory green-light to set up direct stores, after the government tweaked foreign direct investment rules in June 2016. The company hasn’t yet announced where or when these stores will come up. But the bigger challenge for Apple seems to have been negotiating a list of concessions from the government before setting up an assembling facility in India. Although the Modi government keenly wants Apple to set up shop, Reuters reported earlier this year, it wasn’t entirely willing to bend the rules for one company.

The Taiwanese company Wistron Corp. will be doing the on ground assembly for Apple in Karnataka. The iPhones manufactured in India will be meant for the Indian market only and will not be exported at the time. Apple in terms of manufacture has demanded a 15 year tax holiday from the government to start the manufacturing process, which is still being negotiated. Apple will soon after launch Apple owned and operated Apple Stores in several major metropolitan cities of India including Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Chandigarh and Ahmadabad. Apple Stores will bring about reforms in Apple Care services being offered in India which suffer due to poor operation standards of Apple Resellers. It is safe to say that Apple’s next iPhone, which is also the 10th Anniversary iPhone will be assembled right here in India for the Indian market. Whether this will affect pricing and quality standards is yet unknown.   likethis What's your reaction?

The US giant has not confirmed the move, but chief executive Tim Cook said this week the company intended to "invest significantly" in India, where a pick-up in the economy provides ample opportunity for growth. "We have an understanding with Apple and we expect them to start manufacturing in Karnataka by the end of April," Priyank Kharge, minister of information technology and biotechnology in southern Karnataka state, told AFP. He said the new operation would likely assemble iPhones for the domestic market. Apple has only a two-percent share of the Indian market, well behind rival Samsung on 23 percent, according to research firm Canalys. However, last year it had 48 percent of the premium sector in which phones sell for $450 and above. Experts said manufacturing locally would reduce the company's costs and enable it to lower prices. "They're eager to be here because they've identified India as a strategic focus market," said Jaideep Mehta of research firm IDC. "They had a fantastic 2016 in India and shipped more two million devices to India, and now they're looking to ultimately manufacture here as that gives them more flexibility to respond to market changes." Apple currently sells its phones in India through third-party retailers. It is eager to open its own stores but Indian law would require it to procure 30 percent of the components of its products locally. It is not clear whether the Karnataka plans would help it clear that hurdle. Reports in Indian media said Wistron Corp., a Taiwanese electronics manufacturer, was lined up to assemble iPhones at a plant on the outskirts of tech hub Bangalore. Apple outsources all its manufacturing globally. Analysts said that if confirmed the move would be a coup for India's government, which has been trying to persuade foreign companies to manufacture in the country.

Appearing before the Oireachtas Finance Committee, Mr Noonan said he believed the EU Apple case amounted to “political input” and undermined the certainty about business taxes here. Committee senators and TDs quizzed the minister about why Ireland is appealing the EU case and what authorities knew here about “stateless companies” operating with little or no tax obligations. Mr Noonan said the appeal could take four years. So far €1.8m has been spent on lawyers fees in the appeal but there is no idea what the final bill could be. He told members there was “political input” in Europe into the Apple case but said this was because of the “mismatch” of tax rules between different jurisdictions, which is now being addressed. He said he didn’t think the European Commission were “having a go” at Ireland by taking the case, nonetheless, he said, “I don’t think Apple worldwide are paying sufficient tax.” However, the Apple ruling, released last August by Brussels, had undermined certainty here and “corporation tax offerings” here. This would remain so until the case is decided as there will be “uncertainty” [for companies] about what their tax liabilities might be. The case though had not affected investment here, he added. Mr Noonan was repeatedly questioned by Sinn Féin TD Pearse Doherty about where the intellectual property rights of Apple existed or belonged. The minister though refused to be drawn on this, saying it would form the “cornerstone” of Ireland’s appeal. AAA-PBP TD Richard Boyd Barrett argued that it had never been credible to let the profits go to an office that did not essentially exist and Irish people wanted to know why we were not taking the €13bn and instead giving millions of euro to lawyers to fight the tax payment. Mr Noonan insisted Ireland had got the right amount of taxes due to it from Apple. He insisted Brussels had “misused” its state aid powers by taking the Apple case against Ireland. “They [Apple] fully paid tax on profits generated in Ireland.” Meanwhile, the head of Revenue Niall Cody has refused to say when Ireland became aware that Apple was operating a so-called ‘stateless company’, saying this was because of tax “confidentiality”. The European Commission this week told the committee it began investigating Apple’s tax affairs here after the firm told a US senate hearing in 2013 it had arrangements with Ireland. Mr Cody declined to comment for tax “confidentiality” reasons, but he did say: “The idea nobody knew in the US until the senate hearing is just not true.” Mr Doherty accused Revenue of turning a “blind eye” on the situation for many years and also suggested officials may have known about any special tax arrangements as early as the 1990s.

IE Home Nation World Opinion Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Technology Viral Photos Videos E-Paper Apps RSS Gadgets Review Photos Videos Mobile & Tabs Science Indian Express Home Home Technology Tech News Trump immigration ban: Microsoft’s exemption plan, Facebook to be hit by H1-B Trump immigration ban: Microsoft’s exemption plan, Facebook to be hit by H1-B Microsoft President Brad Smith outlined a program for case-by-case review of exceptions to the travel ban By: Tech Desk | Published:February 3, 2017 1:35 pm Microsoft has proposed a program to Trump’s administration which will allow people from these ‘banned’ nations to enter and leave the United States on business or family emergency travel if they hold valid work or student visas. (Source: Reuters) Silicon Valley majors like Apple, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Twitter Uber are resisting President Trump’s executive order on immigration, which has banned the entry of nationals from seven Muslim-majority countries, including those people who have valid visas. There are also reports that the Trump administration wants to toughen the rules for H1-B visas, which is commonly used by Silicon Valley players to get new talent into the country. While a report in Wall Street Journal said Apple is contemplating taking the Trump administration to court for its executive order, another said most of the major technology companies have come up with a draft letter to the President asking him to repeal the order. Now Microsoft has proposed a program to Trump’s administration which will allow people from these ‘banned’ nations to enter and leave the United States on business or family emergency travel if they hold valid work or student visas, and have not committed any crimes. Watch all our videos from Express Technology In a letter to Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Microsoft President Brad Smith outlined a program for case-by-case review of exceptions to a travel ban instituted last week. In Microsoft’s case 76 employees, and 41 dependents were affected by the travel ban. Also read: Microsoft, Amazon and Expedia to support lawsuit against Trump immigration order Meanwhile Amazon and Expedia Inc have filed declarations supporting a legal challenge to the order by the Washington state Attorney General. Microsoft’s proposal would cover holders of the H-1B visa, a temporary work visa that the tech sector relies on to recruit foreign talent. The order has allowed green card holders, but H-1B holders from these affected countries remain banned. According to the Reuters report, “the proposal would also allow students to travel from affected countries if they can prove they were enrolled and in good standing at a US school.” “In short, these individuals are ‘known quantities’ in their communities: their character, personalities, conduct, and behavior is understood by their colleagues, employers, friends, and neighbors,” Microsoft’s Smith said in a blog post. The blog post goes on to say, “Business travel abroad would not include passage through the countries covered by the executive order. Personal travel abroad for exigent family-related emergencies may allow for travel to any country on a case-by-case basis.” Read more: Google employees protest President Trump’s order: What Sergey Brin, Sundar Pichai said It adds that many of the individuals “fill critical roles in the organizations that employ them, whether they are doctors, scientists, engineers, medical technicians, software developers, or any number of other highly skilled professionals,” and “valued contributors to the innovation, research and business acumen of our nation”. Meanwhile, there are reports that the Trump administration and Congress plan to make the H-1B program more restrictive. One company that could be severely impacted by changes to the H1-B visa program is Facebook. A Reuters analysis of US Labour Department filings shows that 15 per cent of Facebook’s US employees in 2016 used a temporary work visa, giving the social media leader a legal classification as a H-1B “dependent” company. The report says this is a higher proportion than Alphabet’s Google, Apple, Amazon.com or Microsoft. The average salary offered for Facebook H-1B jobs was $145,550, according to its application filings last year.

Image courtesy: Narendra Modi Twitter account 0 By Nimish Sawant /  03 Feb 2017 , 12:55 Apple iPhones will be made in Karnataka. The government of Karnataka on Thursday said that it welcomed a proposal from Apple Inc to begin initial manufacturing operations in the state, in a sign the tech company is slowly moving forward with plans to assemble iPhones in the country. “Apple’s intentions to manufacture in Bengaluru will foster cutting edge technology eco system and supply chain development in the state, which are critical for India to compete globally,” the government of the south Indian state said in a statement. While no deal or memorandum of understanding has yet been signed, it is being said that Apple will go ahead with contract manufacturer Wistron to make iPhones in the country. The plant is being set up in Peenya, on the outskirts of Bengaluru. Has Apple got its way?  Apple has declined to comment on the opening of the new Wistron plant in Peenya, which would assemble iPhones. However, after the 25 January meeting with government and DIPP authorities, Apple had this to say: “We’ve been working hard to develop our operations in India and are proud to deliver the best products and services in the world to our customers here. We appreciate the constructive and open dialogue we’ve had with government about further expanding our local operations.” Apple had a lot of ‘demands’ going in. Some of these included, wanting an indefinite exemption from the 30 percent domestic sourcing rule, it would only make iPhones for the Indian market, among other things. At this point it is not clear if any one or all of these demands were fulfilled. We hope none of them were, as we have argued in the past how it would set a bad precedent and why Apple needs India more than the other way round. Officially there is no data out on what has been agreed upon. “There is still no clarity on what has happened with the demands yet. But one thing is clear: India is now a very critical market for Apple. So as much as Apple needs India to increase its bottomline, India also has got a great value proposition with Apple coming here. If will give a boost to the Make in India program and increase its credibility on a global platform,” said Tarun Pathak, senior analyst with Counterpoint Research. Pathak says however that it is unlikely that the government must have agree to all of Apple’s demands as there are around 40 other companies as well who make in India. “While there is no clarity on the matter, there is absolutely no intent to give waivers in complete to Apple,” says Sanchit Vir Gogia, chief analyst at Greyhound Research. “There may be some waivers, sure. But the government’s focus is the need to offer a level-playing field to all participants,” said Gogia. Anshul Gupta, research director at Gartner also echoes the sentiment that there is no incentive for the government to favour Apple over others. “There could have been demands which could make sense for the government to accept for the benefit of the entire device market, not for Apple alone. They might have come up with some fair arguments, but that’s a different thing,” said Gupta. Should other smartphone makers feel the heat? “Absolutely, they have all the reasons to feel threatened,” said Gogia. According to Gogia, most of the local assembling units are not that sophisticated, and an iPhone assembling unit will have state of the art technologies which could change things. “What could happen is that the component manufacturers who were earlier supplying to other manufacturers, will start focussing on Apple. This factor of exclusivity between component manufacturers can become very high with Apple coming in,” said Gogia. Tarun Pathak of Counterpoint Research believes that there shouldn’t be much of an effect on other smartphone makers in India, as they have been around for a while now. “Apple is immune to competition, so in that sense it shouldn’t pose as a challenge to other smartphone makers here,” said Pathak. Gartner research analyst Anshul Gupta sees no reason why Apple coming to India would threaten other smartphone makers in any way. “Apple’s volumes are very low as compared to other smartphone makers here. So whatever demand they will have, can never exceed the supply. Currently, it is a small market for Apple and investments are happening looking at the future. And of course, to minimise the cost.” said Gupta. Ecosystem benefits Everyone we spoke to agreed on the fact that Apple making iPhones in India, would certainly give a boost to the creation of an eco-system here in India. According to Gogia, the ecosystem does exist in some fashion in India. “I think it would be fair to say that the ecosystem will have more opportunities and hence become stronger. But it would be wrong to say that the ecosystem will come because of Apple.” Currently, most of the smartphones made in India basically focus on assembling the components imported from other countries. There isn’t a thriving ecosystem of component makers in all areas that exists in India. “As the demand grows and as assembling plants keep growing, definitely component manufacturers will also be attracted to this market. That ecosystem will slowly build up,” said Gupta. Pathak said that the creation of ecosystem will happen in a phased manner, over a period of around five years. According to the findings of a study conducted by Counterpoint Research and IIM Bangalore, the next phase of ‘Make in India’ will focus on making mobile phone components taking that market to around $15bn over the next five years. Recommendations with phased approach submitted by Counterpoint Research and IIM Bangalore Additional secretary DeITY had said, “During the last 18 months, 40 new mobile phone assembly units and 12 new component/ accessory manufacturing units have started in the country as part of Digital India initiatives. But mobile phones itself have potential to create electronic manufacturing to the tune of over $250bn industry.” The creation of ecosystem will also give a boost the job creation in not just Bengaluru but other parts of India as well. “Karnataka will of course be a big beneficiary, but component markets are spread out all across India, so it would mean job creations in those markets as well. They may have a liasion office in Karnataka, but job creation would not be limited to Karnataka,” said Gogia. According to Gupta, the jobs creation rate will slowly go up and not see a sudden increase. He feels that it is in India’s interest to attract players such as Apple to make in India, as this would make the manufacturing base grow, add more vendors and also boost the job market. It would add manufacturing, to the list of income generators in India alongside IT and Services. As to when the first made in India iPhone will come out and when the assembling of iPhones will begin in India, only time will tell. We have reached out to Bengaluru IT minister Priyank Kharge, and will update the story when we hear back.

Square encourages Apple Pay payments with processing credit Posted Jan 30, 2017 by Romain Dillet (@romaindillet) 0 SHARES Next Story GM and Honda partner to mass produce hydrogen fuel cells in Michigan Square partnered with Apple for a promotion when customers use Apple Pay. Starting today, Square merchants won’t pay any processing fee for the first $12,000 in Apple Pay transactions — that represents around $350 in fees. In addition to this promotion, sellers can also get a free marketing kit (with Apple Pay stickers probably) and training materials to tell employees how Apple Pay works. You’ll need Square’s chip credit card reader that also support contactless payments, such as Apple Pay and Android Pay. In the press release, Square Hardware Lead Jesse Dorogusker says that Apple is involved with this partnership. “Anything we can do to make a seller’s experience faster and safer, including working with Apple to encourage Apple Pay usage, is an investment worth making,” Dorogusker said. It’s unclear if Apple reduced Apple Pay’s fees for Square merchants in order to drive more Apple Pay purchases. Maybe Square also noticed that there’s less fraud with Apple Pay purchases — this way, Square could save money. While Apple Pay has been around for a while, many people still don’t know how to use it. After you realize that you can trigger Apple Pay by double tapping on the home button when your phone is locked, it becomes clear that it’s easier than paying with your credit card. Square has already tried educating merchants and customers about Apple Pay in Portland. After the company’s campaign, contactless payments, such as Apple Pay payments, tripled. It’s interesting to see that Apple can be more aggressive about Apple Pay with partnerships such as today’s program with Square. While it’s hard to change habits, I hope I’ll be able to leave my wallet at home at some point. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Apple Pay Description Apple Pay is a Apple's mobile payment solution for the iPhone 6 and Apple Watch.

The state of Karnataka, where Bangalore is located, has reached an agreement in principle with Apple, said Priyank Kharge, the state's information technology minister. Kharge told CNNMoney that iPhone assembly could start as soon as April at a plant on the outskirts of Bangalore. The plant will be operated by Wistron, an Apple supplier that's headquartered in Taiwan. Apple declined to comment. The U.S. tech giant currently sells iPhones and other products in India through local distributors, but it lags far behind Samsung and Chinese brands such as Xiaomi, Oppo and Lenovo in terms of market share.

The US giant has not confirmed the move, but chief executive Tim Cook said this week the company intended to "invest significantly" in India, where a pick-up in the economy provides ample opportunity for growth. "We have an understanding with Apple and we expect them to start manufacturing in Karnataka by the end of April," Priyank Kharge, minister of information technology and biotechnology in southern Karnataka state, told AFP. Apple has only a two-percent share of the Indian market, well behind rival Samsung on 23 percent, according to research firm Canalys ©SAM PANTHAKY (AFP/File) He said the new operation would likely assemble iPhones for the domestic market. Apple has only a two-percent share of the Indian market, well behind rival Samsung on 23 percent, according to research firm Canalys. However, last year it had 48 percent of the premium sector in which phones sell for $450 and above. Experts said manufacturing locally would reduce the company's costs and enable it to lower prices. "They're eager to be here because they’ve identified India as a strategic focus market," said Jaideep Mehta of research firm IDC. "They had a fantastic 2016 in India and shipped more two million devices to India, and now they're looking to ultimately manufacture here as that gives them more flexibility to respond to market changes." Apple currently sells its phones in India through third-party retailers. It is eager to open its own stores but Indian law would require it to procure 30 percent of the components of its products locally. It is not clear whether the Karnataka plans would help it clear that hurdle. Reports in Indian media said Wistron Corp., a Taiwanese electronics manufacturer, was lined up to assemble iPhones at a plant on the outskirts of tech hub Bangalore. Apple outsources all its manufacturing globally. Analysts said that if confirmed the move would be a coup for India's government, which has been trying to persuade foreign companies to manufacture in the country.

World Bulletin / News Desk Apple is to start making iPhones in India this year, a local government official said Friday, as the firm looks to tap a booming middle class as sales in China slow. "We have an understanding with Apple and we expect them to start manufacturing in Karnataka by the end of April," Priyank Kharge, minister of information technology and biotechnology in southern Karnataka state said. He said the new operation would likely assemble iPhones for the domestic market. Apple has only a two-percent share of the Indian market, well behind rival Samsung on 23 percent, according to research firm Canalys. However, last year it had 48 percent of the premium sector in which phones sell for $450 and above. Experts said manufacturing locally would reduce the company's costs and enable it to lower prices. "They're eager to be here because they’ve identified India as a strategic focus market," said Jaideep Mehta of research firm IDC. "They had a fantastic 2016 in India and shipped more two million devices to India, and now they're looking to ultimately manufacture here as that gives them more flexibility to respond to market changes." Apple currently sells its phones in India through third-party retailers. It is eager to open its own stores but Indian law would require it to procure 30 percent of the components of its products locally.  It is not clear whether the Karnataka plans would help it clear that hurdle. Reports in Indian media said Wistron Corp., a Taiwanese electronics manufacturer, was lined up to assemble iPhones at a plant on the outskirts of tech hub Bangalore. Apple outsources all its manufacturing globally.  Analysts said that if confirmed the move would be a coup for India's government, which has been trying to persuade foreign companies to manufacture in the country.

The brand itself hasn’t commented on the matter, though an official announcement might not be too far away. The Karnataka administration’s release talked about how Apple’s intentions to set up base in Bengaluru will foster a cutting-edge technology ecosystem and supply chain development. The state’s IT Minister Priyank Kharge later posted a tweet where he announced the firm’s initial manufacturing operations. However, his comment was later deleted from Twitter and subsequently replaced by a snippet of the Karnataka government’s official statement. This could be taken as a sign that the deal has not been completely finalized, but is at an advanced stage in negotiations. Also Read: Apple chooses Wistron to supply iPhone 8 in India Apple officials flew into India last month to put forward a list of demands to the government before it agreed to start production in the nation. Reports allege that it had constructive talks with officials. However, it remains to be seen whether the firm’s requirements will be met. Apple is apparently asking for things like a 15-year exemption on customs duty and tax concessions. If given the green signal, the brand will probably rely on Wistron to handle iPhone assembly. The government is supposedly keen on getting the company to produce phone components as well, effectively creating a manufacturing ecosystem in the city. Apple has apparently chosen Wistron as the primary supplier of the iPhone 8 in India. The latter’s factory may begin production in April or June and transition to full manufacturing by the end of the year.

By Natalie Gagliordi for Between the Lines | January 31, 2017 -- 21:43 GMT (13:43 PST) | Topic: Mobility Image: CNET Apple handily topped Q1 earnings targets with its highest quarterly revenue ever. The company also set an all-time record for iPhone sales. The Cupertino, Calif.-based technology giant reported Q1 net income of $17.9 billion, or $3.36 a share. The company made $78.4 billion in revenue. Does the iPhone still matter? Huawei, not Apple, now drives the mobile conversation Cupertino is a victim of its own success and is fully responsible for creating the Chinese Android monster. Read More Wall Street was expecting first-quarter earnings of $3.22 per share on revenue of $77.38 billion. "We're thrilled to report that our holiday quarter results generated Apple's highest quarterly revenue ever, and broke multiple records along the way," said Apple CEO Tim Cook. "We sold more iPhones than ever before and set all-time revenue records for iPhone, Services, Mac and Apple Watch. Revenue from Services grew strongly over last year, led by record customer activity on the App Store, and we are very excited about the products in our pipeline." Apple sold 78.29 million iPhones in Q1, which is up 5 percent year over year. From a revenue perspective that's $54.37 billion in sales for the iPhone in the quarter. Here's the breakdown for the quarter: iPhones: 78.3 million, up from 74.7 million in the year-ago quarter iPads: 13.1 million million, down from 16.1 million in the year-ago quarter Macs: 5.4 million, down from 5.3 million in the year-ago quarter Services (which includes iTunes and Apple Pay): $7.2 billion. Other products (accessories and Apple Watch are included, but not broken out separately): $4.02 billion. Gross margin for the quarter was 38.5 percent compared to 40.1 percent in the year-ago quarter. Apple said international sales accounted for 64 percent of the first quarter's revenue. Apple's board also declared a cash dividend of 57 cents per share, payable on February 16. Apple said for the fiscal second quarter that it expects revenue between $51.5 billion and $53.5billion. Wall Street is looking for earnings of $2.09 on revenue of 53.94 billion. Apple's stock ticked up around three percent in after-hours trading.

The state of Karnataka, where Bangalore is located, has reached an agreement in principle with Apple, said Priyank Kharge, the state’s information technology minister. Kharge told CNNMoney that iPhone assembly could start as soon as April at a plant on the outskirts of Bangalore. The plant will be operated by Wistron, an Apple supplier that’s headquartered in Taiwan. Apple declined to comment. The U.S. tech giant currently sells iPhones and other products in India through local distributors, but it lags far behind Samsung and Chinese brands such as Xiaomi, Oppo and Lenovo in terms of market share.

Appearing before the Oireachtas Finance Committee, Mr Noonan said he believed the EU Apple case amounted to “political input” and undermined the certainty about business taxes here. Committee senators and TDs quizzed the minister about why Ireland is appealing the EU case and what authorities knew here about “stateless companies” operating with little or no tax obligations. Mr Noonan said the appeal could take four years. So far €1.8m has been spent on lawyers fees in the appeal but there is no idea what the final bill could be. He told members there was “political input” in Europe into the Apple case but said this was because of the “mismatch” of tax rules between different jurisdictions, which is now being addressed. He said he didn’t think the European Commission were “having a go” at Ireland by taking the case, nonetheless, he said, “I don’t think Apple worldwide are paying sufficient tax.” However, the Apple ruling, released last August by Brussels, had undermined certainty here and “corporation tax offerings” here. This would remain so until the case is decided as there will be “uncertainty” [for companies] about what their tax liabilities might be. The case though had not affected investment here, he added. Mr Noonan was repeatedly questioned by Sinn Féin TD Pearse Doherty about where the intellectual property rights of Apple existed or belonged. The minister though refused to be drawn on this, saying it would form the “cornerstone” of Ireland’s appeal. AAA-PBP TD Richard Boyd Barrett argued that it had never been credible to let the profits go to an office that did not essentially exist and Irish people wanted to know why we were not taking the €13bn and instead giving millions of euro to lawyers to fight the tax payment. Mr Noonan insisted Ireland had got the right amount of taxes due to it from Apple. He insisted Brussels had “misused” its state aid powers by taking the Apple case against Ireland. “They [Apple] fully paid tax on profits generated in Ireland.” Meanwhile, the head of Revenue Niall Cody has refused to say when Ireland became aware that Apple was operating a so-called ‘stateless company’, saying this was because of tax “confidentiality”. The European Commission this week told the committee it began investigating Apple’s tax affairs here after the firm told a US senate hearing in 2013 it had arrangements with Ireland. Mr Cody declined to comment for tax “confidentiality” reasons, but he did say: “The idea nobody knew in the US until the senate hearing is just not true.” Mr Doherty accused Revenue of turning a “blind eye” on the situation for many years and also suggested officials may have known about any special tax arrangements as early as the 1990s.

Budget 2017: Budget 2017 is out: Read how it impacts you and India BENGALURU: A formal deal between Apple Inc., and Wistron Corporation, the Taiwanese original design manufacturer, about launching the production of iPhones in Bengaluru will come through only after the tech giant manages to successfully negotiate sops for its India investments from the Centre. “Apple Inc., will not come on board immediately until it completes the ongoing negotiations with the government of India,” said a top government official. Wistron has, through an Indian arm, an existing facility at Peenya, an industrial suburb near Bengaluru, and is briskly ramping up its manufacturing capacity in anticipation of an early deal from the Cupertino-based smartphone maker. The Taiwanese firm is making investments on the back of a green signal from Apple, sources say. Karnataka, its Information Technology Minister Priyank Kharge said, has been working on getting the Apple unit to Bengaluru for the last six months, but kept the talks under wraps. “We are not talking to any OEM, but Apple Inc., representatives directly,” Kharge told ET, referring to the Wistron investment. The government, he said, is willing to facilitate any high-end manufacturing in Karnataka including that of iPhone. “We are open to provide necessary incentives and concessions if the investments are substantial,” the Minister said. Apple Inc., has not made any official application with Karnataka because it is known to work through a third party manufacturer. The government is bullish that the making of iPhones in Bengaluru will begin in the next few months. Karnataka may also grant some sops, and the investors are studying the fineprints of the State’s electronic system design and manufacturing (ESDM) policy. “Wistron is in the process of expanding its facility, through its Indian arm. We are supporting them in terms of faster statutory clearances for additional power sanction, and fire certification,” said Gaurav Gupta, Karnataka’s Commissioner for Industries. Karnataka, which got 13th place in the ease-of-doing-business survey last year, is leaving no stone unturned to make the Apple project a reality both for its snob value, and to silence criticism that Bengaluru is crumbling due to its traffic and infrastructure issues. The government is also working on getting its municipal bodies to spruce up the access roads to the plant so that transport of product shipment is smooth. GAMECHANGER : While the phase I of Wistron will focus more on assembling iPhones, the real gamechanger will happen when the manufacturer progresses into phase II as it is more about local sourcing. That will help a large number of component makers in and around Bengaluru. When phase two of Wistron happens, it will help small component makers in and around Bengaluru. How soon the phase II will happen depends on the GST rollout, said a government source. The phase II, according to government officials, is more critical because that will not only help Indian component makers, but will also enable the tech giant to export iPhones from Bengaluru to overseas markets. According to reports, Apple sold 2.5 million iPhone units, and a local unit in India might boost its sales further due to the price advantage on account of savings on custom duty and other levies.

The post has since been taken down, but initially included the caption: “How did I end up in the studio with Dr Dre ON THE night his deal went public that he did with Apple 3.2 BILLION!!!!! The BEATS HEADPHONES JUST CHANGED HIP HOP!!!!!!” WATCH: The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Financial Times reported the story Thursday citing sources briefed on the talks. Beats by Dre headphones‘ annual sales revenues have reportedly gone up to $1.5 billion since the company was founded with music executive Jimmy Iovine began selling headphones in 2008. The deal would include the new Beats Music streaming service, which Apple is likely acquiring to compete with streaming services like Pandora and Spotify after the company’s iTunes Radio failed to impress the industry. Apple’s revenue growth has declined sharply in recent years, and the company only entered the broadly popular streaming market last year — late because of former CEO Steve Jobs’ reported unfavorable opinion of music subscription services. The company continues to be the largest seller of music downloads, but is losing market share to companies like Amazon. Purchasing Beats would mark Apple’s largest acquisition ever. The headphones retail between about $169.95 to $449.95, depending on model and features, and despite many music and sound industry experts describing their quality as “extraordinarily bad,” the brand has become enormously popular as a fashion item among a younger consumer base, and the popular alternative to standard earbuds models. Beats’ success is due in large part to its wide profit margins – despite the steep prices of the popular bass-heavy headphone models, each individual unit reportedly only costs around $14 to produce. Private equity firm Carlyle Group invested $500 million in Beats last year, and valued the company at more than $1 billion. Neither Apple nor Beats would comment on the deal in the original reports, and the briefed sources said they were still in the negotiation stage. Though the companies have yet to consummate the agreement, and it could still fall through, if things go as planned the official announcement could be made as early as next week.

 The Apple TV is not selling well Kif Leswing Jan. 31, 2017, 6:43 PM 12,248 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple/Business Insider Apple reported record revenue and profit when it reported first fiscal quarter earnings on Tuesday. iPhone sales were up. Mac sales were up. Apple had a great quarter. One notable category, however, that Apple saw significant annual declines in, was in "others," a catch-all category where Apple lists sales of products like the Apple Watch, various accessories and dongles, Beats headphones, and the Apple TV.  That category got crushed. It was down 8% from the same time last year, despite a recent Apple Watch launch and new headphones that went on sale during the quarter.  Apple Watch wasn't the reason it fell — Apple CEO Tim Cook said that Apple Watch set company records for unit sales and revenue, although he declined to share either figure. It turns out at least one reason why Apple's "others" revenue was down was the Apple TV. The Apple TV saw a year-over-year decline in sales, Apple CFO Luca Maestri told the Financial Times. My colleague Dave Smith recently outlined why the Apple TV has been a disappointment from a product perspective: While the hardware is capable, the overall experience is muddy, confusing, and bad, he wrote.  It sounds like the general public has had a similar response to the black box. To return the product line to growth, it now looks like Apple will need to release a new version.  Apple CEO Tim Cook hinted at larger television ambitions during the call. "We've come a long way in a year and it gives us a platform to build off of," he said of the $149 device. "We are learning a lot about the original content business and thinking about ways we could play it." Read more about Apple's earnings over at our live blog.

Kharge tells Bloomberg News that manufacturing will begin in state capital Bangalore, officially known as Bengalaru, by the end of April. Apple is said to be partnering with Taiwanese contract manufacturer Wistron for its Indian operations. “Apple's intentions to make iPhones in Bengaluru will foster cutting-edge technology ecosystem and supply chain development in the state,” Kharge said in a tweet, while also telling Bloomberg News that all Indian-produced iPhones will be for the domestic market. Apple, which has reportedly negotiated hard with the Indian government on tax exemptions and other incentives, is yet to comment. “I feel really good about how we're doing [in India],” Apple CEO Tim Cook said on an earnings call this week after reporting record revenues for the country. “We are in discussions on a number of things, including retail stores, and fully intend to invest significantly in the country and believe it's a great place to be.” Apple still only has a small share of the market in India, since its devices are priced too high for the majority of consumers. With a population of around 1.3 billion, however, the country is seen as one of Apple's most important long-term growth markets.

More videos Banks, Apple in stoush over digital wallets A draft decision from the ACCC denies several of the big banks from negotiating as a bloc with Apple for access to its NFC technology. It says this is likely because Apple Pay, which allows tap-and-go payments on the iPhone, also makes it easy for customers to quickly switch their "default" card used for payments on the iPhone, and go to a rival if there is a better deal on offer. In the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, Apple says lenders have competed more aggressively for customers by offering deals to entice people to use the bank's card in Apple Pay. Related Content MasterCard 'Selfie Pay' coming to Australia in 2017 Apple iPhone sales dip over The types of perks included extra frequent flyer points, discounts on shopping, or cash-backs, it said, pointing to offers from big foreign banks such as Citi, Wells Fargo, Chase Bank and UK lender TSB.  "Apple expects that, with a range of payment cards available in [its] wallet [product] in Australia, the same increase in competition is likely to occur in Australia as has been evident in these other jurisdictions," the submission said. Advertisement Apple also argued its system would allow smaller lenders to better compete with banks in the card market, because they had less resources to develop their own digital wallets. A perceived lack of competition in credit cards has been a concern for government, with Treasury last year saying banks did not compete fiercely on credit card interest rates. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Apple argues banks will compete more if customers can easily switch cards through Apple Pay. Photo: Supplied Apple's prediction is included in a new submission the technology giant, published on Friday, as part of its long-running fight with Westpac, National Australia Bank, Commonwealth Bank and Bendigo Bank, over Apple Pay. The banks are seeking permission from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to team up in their talks with Apple and launch a collective boycott of Apple Pay, but the draft ruling went against the banks last year. ANZ Bank has broken from its rivals and is offering its customers Apple Pay, as are several smaller lenders. In a fight where both sides are immensely powerful, and both claim their actions will benefit consumers, ACCC chairman Rod Sims said in November the decision was "finely balanced'. A final decision is expected next month. One reason Mr Sims leaned in Apple's favour was that he believed non-bank digital wallets could become a "disruptive technology" that could boost competition by making it easier for customers to switch card providers, and not get locked into banks' own digital wallets.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 3 February 2017 | MYT 2:00 PM Irish calculation similar to EU on Apple tax estimate: minister In progress: Noonan said Irish officials were still negotiating the terms of a ring-fenced escrow fund where the back taxes will be held pending the outcome of the appeals process, which the Irish government has said could take four or five years. — Reuters DUBLIN: The European Commission's estimate that Apple owes Ireland up to €13bil (RM61.89bil) in a disputed tax ruling is unlikely to be altered greatly by Dublin's calculations, the Irish finance minister said on Feb 2.  The Commission ordered Apple to pay Ireland the unpaid taxes after ruling in August that the iPhone maker won sweetheart tax deals from Dublin amounting to illegal state aid. The Irish government and Apple have appealed the demand.  The Commission said it expected that the amount owed would total €13bil (RM61.89bil) plus interest but required Ireland to calculate the exact sums based on the methodology designed and set out in the ruling.  "So far my officials haven't indicated to me that it's going to seriously overrun the 13 (billion euros) or come seriously short of the 13, but there are other years to be assessed and so on," Finance Minister Michael Noonan told a parliamentary committee, referring to the 10-year period the calculations are based on.  Noonan said Irish officials were still negotiating the terms of a ring-fenced escrow fund where the back taxes will be held pending the outcome of the appeals process, which the Irish government has said could take four or five years.  Ireland requested an extension to complete the collection of the funds after a formal deadline for doing so elapsed last month. The EU's antitrust regulator said on Jan 31 that the Commission was satisfied with Ireland's progress to date. — Reuters You May Be Interested Under attack from hackers, UK isn’t hiring staff fast enough Facebook, Microsoft said to circulate immigration open letter Credit card thieves move online as chips cut in-store fraud Microsoft asks for exception programme on Trump orders Here’s Apple’s challenge in India Indian IT firms to meet Trump officials on visa reform concerns Others Also Read Former MIC legal adviser Selva Mookiah awarded datukship ‘Paradise’ Pulau Mengalum popular with tourists from China For a tossing good celebration advertisement Latest News Apple to build iPhone in India this year: official Amazon projects spending that concerns investors watching profit Snap signed five-year, US$2bil deal to use Google’s Cloud Nintendo plays with fire as new mobile game takes ‘gacha’ global Under attack from hackers, UK isn’t hiring staff fast enough Most Viewed in Tech Apple to build iPhone in India this year: official Is it time to say ‘goodbye’ to Google Allo?

According to the Kharge, Apple executives met with him in January and confirmed the development. Note that in the budget this week, the finance minister announced a Rs 745 crore incentive for electronic manufacturing in the country through Modified Special Incentive Package Scheme (M-SIPS) and Electronic Development Fund (EDF). We said then that such incentives or electronics manufacturing will provide an additional stimulant to smartphone manufacturers, especially foreign makers like Apple and Xiaomi who are subject to mandatory local production. Interestingly, the minister further mentioned that all devices made in the country will be targeted at the domestic market, and that it would help the company find additional or other contract manufacturers in the region. Currently, Apple has tied up with Taiwan’s Wistron Corp to assemble the phones. Note that in 2015, Wistron had setup a mobile manufacturing unit in Noida for Optiemus Infracom, the founder of the domestic mobile brand Zen Mobile. It has been long rumoured that the Cupertino-headquartered company is looking to set up a base in India for manufacturing iPhones and other devices. In 2015, it was reported that Foxconn was sending a delegation of officers to look for locations to set up a base for Apple. However, it looks like this didn’t quite work out. Advertisement Apple retail: Apple has been asking the Indian government to relax FDI in retail norms for opening its own stores, since early 2014. In July last year, Tim Cook said that “India is now one of our fastest growing markets…We’re looking forward to opening retail stores in India down the road.” The recent budget did announce a new roadmap for foreign direct investments (FDI), which could be tweaked, removed or at least reduced, although this remains to be seen. 01 Related #Apple #Devices #Handset Manufacturers #iPhone #local manufacturing #Mobile Related Foxconn may manufacture Apple iPhones in India Why India needs to allow commercial resale of refurbished smartphones Optiemus Infracom to offer phone manufacturing facilities in Noida Apple Keynote lowdown: 4″ iPhone, Siri on TVs, CareKit tracker & more Apple’s WWDC 2016: Updates on iOS, macOS, tvOS, Watch OS The Lowdown: Apple Introduces iPhone 5 & New iPod Lineup < Previous Next > Amazon applies for government nod to store and sell food online Thoughts On How GST Would Impact e-commerce In India Daily Newsletter More in Wistron Corporation Apple to start manufacturing iPhones in Bangalore by April: report Optiemus Infracom to offer phone manufacturing facilities in Noida Digital Jobs Creative Head Require Testing Engineer at scandal joyce banda Hiring Maintenance Engineer for scandal joyce banda Journalist Comments Grimmjow: HDFC net banking bill pay always redirected to billdesk, so...

 The Apple TV is not selling well Kif Leswing Jan. 31, 2017, 6:43 PM 12,248 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple/Business Insider Apple reported record revenue and profit when it reported first fiscal quarter earnings on Tuesday. iPhone sales were up. Mac sales were up. Apple had a great quarter. One notable category, however, that Apple saw significant annual declines in, was in "others," a catch-all category where Apple lists sales of products like the Apple Watch, various accessories and dongles, Beats headphones, and the Apple TV.  That category got crushed. It was down 8% from the same time last year, despite a recent Apple Watch launch and new headphones that went on sale during the quarter.  Apple Watch wasn't the reason it fell — Apple CEO Tim Cook said that Apple Watch set company records for unit sales and revenue, although he declined to share either figure. It turns out at least one reason why Apple's "others" revenue was down was the Apple TV. The Apple TV saw a year-over-year decline in sales, Apple CFO Luca Maestri told the Financial Times. My colleague Dave Smith recently outlined why the Apple TV has been a disappointment from a product perspective: While the hardware is capable, the overall experience is muddy, confusing, and bad, he wrote.  It sounds like the general public has had a similar response to the black box. To return the product line to growth, it now looks like Apple will need to release a new version.  Apple CEO Tim Cook hinted at larger television ambitions during the call. "We've come a long way in a year and it gives us a platform to build off of," he said of the $149 device. "We are learning a lot about the original content business and thinking about ways we could play it." Read more about Apple's earnings over at our live blog.

(Bloomberg/File) Topics iphone-6s iPhone Share this article  share on facebook  share on twitter  share on google plus  share on Linkedin  share on whatsapp  comment  share on email share this article follow Us    Apple Inc. will begin assembling iPhones in India by the end of April, a regional minister says, heightening its focus on the world’s fastest-growing major smartphone market as growth slows elsewhere. The U.S. company has tapped Taiwan’s Wistron Corp. to put together its phones in the tech capital of Bangalore in Karnataka, said Priyank Kharge, the state’s information technology minister. Apple executives met with him in January and confirmed the timeline, he said in an interview. The start of iPhone assembly in India comes after months of speculation on Apple’s plan for the market, which is led by rival Samsung Electronics Co. It signals a renewed focus on the country, where it just scrapes into the top 10, as growth begins to slow in China and other more mature markets. The Cupertino, California-based company is said to have put forward a long list of demands -- including a 15-year tax holiday to import components and equipment -- in negotiations with India’s federal government.  “Apple’s iPhones will be made in Bangalore and all devices will be targeted at the domestic market,” said Kharge, IT minister for Karnataka, of which Bangalore is the capital. Kharge said the state will help Apple if it decides to turn to other contract manufacturers in the region. “We did not discuss any other incentives,” he said. Apple didn’t immediately respond to an e-mailed request for comment. Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said in an earnings call this week that India is “the place to be.” (Read also: Apple sales beat estimates on demand for latest iPhones) The company shipped 2.5 million iPhones into the country in 2016. While that is its best year ever in terms of revenues and sales, it only ranked 10th among vendors in the December quarter according Counterpoint Research. Apple accounts for less than 2 percent of shipments in India, where an estimated 750 million smartphones will be sold by 2020. The devices will be assembled through a plant on Bangalore’s outskirts operated by Wistron, a Taiwanese contract manufacturer.

 Irish calculation similar to EU on Apple tax estimate: minister Reuters Feb. 2, 2017, 6:55 AM 79 facebook linkedin twitter email print The Apple logo is pictured on an iPhone in an illustration photo taken in Bordeaux Thomson Reuters DUBLIN (Reuters) - The European Commission's estimate that Apple owes Ireland up to 13 billion euros ($14 billion) in a disputed tax ruling is unlikely to be altered greatly by Dublin's calculations, the Irish finance minister said on Thursday. The Commission ordered Apple to pay Ireland the unpaid taxes after ruling in August that the iPhone maker won sweetheart tax deals from Dublin amounting to illegal state aid. The Irish government and Apple have appealed the demand. The Commission said it expected that the amount owed would total 13 billion euros plus interest but required Ireland to calculate the exact sums based on the methodology designed and set out in the ruling. "So far my officials haven't indicated to me that it's not going to seriously overrun the 13 (billion euros) or come seriously short of the 13, but there are other years to be assessed and so on," Finance Minister Michael Noonan told a parliamentary committee, referring to the 10-year period the calculations are based on. Noonan said Irish officials were still negotiating the terms of a ring-fenced escrow fund where the back taxes will be held pending the outcome of the appeals process, which the Irish government has said could take four or five years. Ireland requested an extension to complete the collection of the funds after a formal deadline for doing so elapsed last month. The EU's antitrust regulator said on Tuesday that the Commission was satisfied with Ireland's progress to date.

Good News! In all probability, Apple will soon start manufacturing in India. According report coming out of Bengaluru, the Karnataka state government have formally shared a proposal with Apple to commence initial manufacturing operations. The manufacturing unit will be placed in Peenya, Bengaluru. The move could be a huge endoresement for the city and region, and likely to attract a lot of follow on investments from Apple and others in its wake.  Though Apple is not the first foreign manufacturer to do so, with companies like Xiaomi and Huawei already manufacturing smartphones in the country, getting the world's most valuabe and profitable company does have its own advantages.     As the release signed by Priyank Kharge, IT Minister - Karnataka read - “Apple’s intentions to manufacture in Bengaluru will foster cutting edge technology eco system and supply chain development in the state, which are critical for India to compete globally,”   The release didn’t state any timeline as to when production will start. Some internal sources claim that it will happen starting June 2017. Further, as reported earlier, Apple’s Taiwanese partner, Wistron will handle the entire manufacturing procedure in Peenya. To recall, Wistron was previously involved in the production of the iPhone 5c and iPhone SE, and the company was also rumoured to be one of the manufacturers of the iPhone 6, the iPad and Apple Watch.   Moreover, India is only the third country where Apple will assemble its products which apparently shows how important India, as a market, has become in all these years. As stated by the Times of India, Apple deploys about 766 suppliers spread across 28 countries, although assembling is only done in the United States and China as of now.  For India, which has moved up to no.6 in the global ranking for manufacturing, the move is a welcome boost to buttress those numbers.  Talking about the consequences of this decision, Apple products will probably see a price drop in near future as currently it attracts 12.5 percent of additional duty over its global price. On the other hand, as per the latest Budget 2017, Make in India smartphones are likely to see price hike. This is because government will now charge 2 percent special additional duty on populated printed circuit boards (PCB) used for mobile phones imported into the country.

The post has since been taken down, but initially included the caption: “How did I end up in the studio with Dr Dre ON THE night his deal went public that he did with Apple 3.2 BILLION!!!!! The BEATS HEADPHONES JUST CHANGED HIP HOP!!!!!!” WATCH: The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Financial Times reported the story Thursday citing sources briefed on the talks. Beats by Dre headphones‘ annual sales revenues have reportedly gone up to $1.5 billion since the company was founded with music executive Jimmy Iovine began selling headphones in 2008. The deal would include the new Beats Music streaming service, which Apple is likely acquiring to compete with streaming services like Pandora and Spotify after the company’s iTunes Radio failed to impress the industry. Apple’s revenue growth has declined sharply in recent years, and the company only entered the broadly popular streaming market last year — late because of former CEO Steve Jobs’ reported unfavorable opinion of music subscription services. The company continues to be the largest seller of music downloads, but is losing market share to companies like Amazon. Purchasing Beats would mark Apple’s largest acquisition ever. The headphones retail between about $169.95 to $449.95, depending on model and features, and despite many music and sound industry experts describing their quality as “extraordinarily bad,” the brand has become enormously popular as a fashion item among a younger consumer base, and the popular alternative to standard earbuds models. Beats’ success is due in large part to its wide profit margins – despite the steep prices of the popular bass-heavy headphone models, each individual unit reportedly only costs around $14 to produce. Private equity firm Carlyle Group invested $500 million in Beats last year, and valued the company at more than $1 billion. Neither Apple nor Beats would comment on the deal in the original reports, and the briefed sources said they were still in the negotiation stage. Though the companies have yet to consummate the agreement, and it could still fall through, if things go as planned the official announcement could be made as early as next week.

(Source: Reuters) The government of the state of Karnataka said on Thursday it welcomed a proposal from Apple Inc to begin initial manufacturing operations in the state, in a sign the tech company is slowly moving forward with plans to assemble iPhones in the country. “Apple’s intentions to manufacture in Bengaluru will foster cutting edge technology ecosystem and supply chain development in the state, which are critical for India to compete globally,” the government of Karnataka state said in a statement. A source familiar with the matter told Reuters, however, that no deal, or memorandum of understanding had so far been finalised with the Karnataka government. The person, who asked not to be named, said if Apple did go ahead with plans to begin assembling the iPhone, it was likely to do so initially at a plant being set up by its Taiwanese manufacturing partner Wistron Corp at Peenya on the outskirts of the tech hub of Bengaluru, Karnataka. Watch all our videos from Express Technology Apple was not immediately reachable for comment. Cupertino, California-based Apple, is keen to assemble its phones in India, one of the world’s fastest growing smartphone markets. Apple representatives met with federal and state government officials in India last week, as it is lobbying hard for a raft of tax and sourcing concessions from India, before it begins to assemble iPhones in the country. Read more: Apple seeks 15-year Customs duty holiday before setting up India unit Following the meetings, Apple said it appreciated the open and constructive dialogue it held with Indian officials, around the expansion of its local operations in the country. Any final decision around manufacturing in India however, is likely to still be contingent on the government’s willingness to concede ground on the concessions sought by the company. Last month, Information Technology Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said India would consider Apple’s request for incentives to invest in the country with an “open mind.” On its part, the government of Karnataka said on Thursday it was “committed to new initiatives in any sector for manufacturing and will provide a conducive environment for investment.” Tags: Apple Budget 2017 BusinessMost deposited Rs 2 lakh or more, some used one PAN for 20 accounts: Govt Budget wasted, no steps to spur growth: Chidambaram BusinessEnforcing Rs 15-lakh cap on cash holding difficult; idea still being examined, says Hasmukh Adhia Best of Express ED moves SC against special court's order discharging Marans in Aircel-Maxis case, hearing at 2 pm today EntertainmentRaees box office collection day 9: Shah Rukh Khan film collects Rs 122.36 crore EntertainmentAjith's six-pack abs in Vivegam impress SRK EntertainmentBeyonce's nude pregnancy photoshoot EntertainmentKung Fu Yoga movie review Must Read SportsYuzvendra Chahal thrives in adversity SportsDespite roll back, BCCI will earn around Rs 2,500 crore SportsAITA paying the price for selection disaster: Bopanna TechnologyApple iPhones will be manufactured in Bengaluru: Here are the details TechnologyTrump immigration ban: Microsoft's exemption plan, Facebook to be hit by H1-B TechnologyXiaomi Redmi Note 4 sale on Mi.com over, all versions out of stock  LFW S/R 2017: Preity Zinta steals the show in a Mekhla Chador on Day 2, highlights Feb 03: Latest News BHU admissions 2017: Banaras Hindu University begins application process Kite festival held in Pune Two billion years of volcanic activity on Mars unveiled Sanjay Dutt biopic in safe hands: Priya Dutt In New York refugee haven, new anxiety in age of Donald Trump                           The Express Group The Indian Express The Financial Express Loksatta Jansatta inUth Ramnath Goenka Awards Privacy Policy Advertise with Us Contact Us Subscribe Please reload and try again !!!

Apple will soon have `Made in India' iPhones, and they will come out of a factory in Bengaluru. The Karnataka government on Thursday issued a release welcoming Apple's proposal "to commence initial manufacturing operations" in the state. TOI was the first to report, in December, that Apple had finalized Bengaluru as the assembling location, but officials in neither Apple nor the government were then willing to confirm the development. The release, signed by state IT minister Priyank Kharge, said Apple's intentions to manufacture in Bengaluru "will foster cutting edge technology ecosystem and supply chain development in the state, which are critical for India to compete globally." Though it did not provide a timeline, production is expected to begin in June. India will be only the third country globally to assemble iPhones, an indication of how important the country has become for one of the world's most valued companies. The release said state ministers and officials had met with several senior Apple executives including Cupertino-based Priya Balasubramaniam, VP - iPhone operations, Dheeraj Chugh, director - iPhone operations, and Ali Khanafer, senior manager - government affairs (India and Middle East). Taiwanese company Wistron, an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of Apple, will make the iPhones out of its facility in the city's industrial hub of Peenya. In December, Apple had published job openings on its portal for several positions at its OEM in Bengaluru, including an iPhone operations program manager whose responsibility would involve leading the OEM operations team, managing component readiness, ensuring parts availability, quality and collaborating with cross-functional supply chain teams. The government said discussions are on with Apple for collaborations in other areas too. It did not specify what these areas are, but the government is said to be pushing for manufacture of some phone components too, so as to create a manufacturing ecosystem in the city. In May, Apple had announced a design and development accelerator in the city to grow the iOS developer community and also guide Indian developers to leverage Apple's programming language Swift and build apps for Apple TV and Apple Watch. "We made concerted efforts to reach out to Apple directly. We want to create a conducive environment for global majors like Apple so that we emerge as their preferred partner in their India growth story," Kharge told TOI. Gujarat, Maharasthra and Telangana too were competing for the Apple facility. Apple uses a fairly complex supply chain. The parts for the iPhone, iPad, iPod and Mac are manufactured, mostly by third parties, across 28 countries. It has 766 suppliers, of which 346 are based in China, 126 in Japan, and 69 in the US. There is one in India, a unit of Flextronics in Sriperumbudur in Tamil Nadu. "There is no component ecosystem in the country besides what Samsung has done in India. With Apple's China sales slowing down, it's opportunity India, and Apple might look at a different SKU, distribution and sourcing model to make it affordable to millions of aspiring customers," said Navkendar Singh, senior research manager - mobile devices research, India and South Asia, in research firm IDC. Vishal Tripathi, research director in Gartner, said the move to assemble in Bengaluru is a good starting point that positions India as a strong alternative site to China and Taiwan that have been strongholds in manufacturing. "It has put India in a different stead," he said. Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!

Home Industry Technology Apple iPhones will be manufactured in Bengaluru from April: Find out the details Apple iPhones will be manufactured in Bengaluru from April: Find out the details Apple is officially going to make its iPhones in India, in the city of Bengaluru from April. Taking the 'Make in India' route the company is finally moving closer to iPhone assembly in the country. By: FE Online | Updated: February 3, 2017 11:08 AM Apple, to manufacture iPhones, has turned to India, the world’s fastest-growing smartphone market, to reverse slowing global sales. (Source: AP) Apple is officially going to make its iPhones in India, in the city of Bengaluru from April. Taking the ‘Make in India’ route the company is finally moving closer to iPhone assembly in the country. The government of the Indian state of Karnataka said on Thursday it welcomed a proposal from Apple to begin initial manufacturing operations in the state, in a sign the tech company is slowly moving forward with plans to assemble iPhones in the country. The Karnataka Government issued a press release notifying of the same. However, Apple has still not commented on the issue. The press release reads as: “Apple’s representatives led by Ms. Priya Balasubramaniam, VP iPhone operations, Mr. Ali Khanafer (Head, Government Affairs), Mr.Dheeraj Chugh (Director, iphone operations) and Mr. Priyesh Povanna (Country Counsel) met with Ministers and officials of Government of Karnataka and had positive discussions about the initiatives in manufacturing and possible collaborations with state Government in other areas.” The statement adds: “Apple’s intentions to manufacture in Bengaluru will foster cutting edge technology ecosystem and supply chain development in the state, which are critical for India to compete globally. The Government of Karnataka is committed to new initiatives in any sector for manufacturing and will provide a conducive environment for investment,” IE reported. The plant, according to reports, will be set up by Apple’s Taiwanese manufacturing partner Wistron, at Peenya in Bangalore. Apple has reportedly been discussing the plausibility of making the iPhones in the country, with the government, with an aim to make inroads in the South Asian market. Tim Cook considers India a big market and visited India in May 2016 when he met PM Narendra Modi and other celebrities. Cook had said that there was a rise in revenues in India. The Cupertino giant currently sells its devices through Indian distribution companies and retailers. Recently a source had told FE that, the company had sought information on the kind of incentives, including taxation and other things, it would be provided if it starts manufacturing in India. Sources also said that an inter-ministerial panel might be discussing the likely incentives Apple would be provided if it wants to manufacture or assemble in India. Currently, the assembling of these devices is done mainly by Foxconn Tech Group in China. However, other big rivals like Samsung and even China’s Xiaomi have been assembling in India for some time. This move will give a big boost in the sales of its devices, especially iPhones which still have not made much of a mark in a big smartphone market like India. The company had also in January reportedly sought permission from the government to open its stores. In June, PM Modi-led government eased the FDI restrictions in many sectors, where it said that single brand retailers like Apple are allowed to open stores but they have to purchase a minimum of 30 percent of manufacturing materials from vendors in India after a period of three years which can be difficult of Apple as there are not many manufacturers in India.

"An Apple team discussed with us its proposal to set up a plant in Bengaluru to make iPhones for the Indian and global markets," said Kharge in a statement here. An Apple team, led by iPhone Operations Vice-President Priya Balasubramaniam, Government Affairs Head Ali Khanafer, iPhone Operations Director Dheeraj Chugh and Country Counsel Priyesh Povanna discussed the proposals with the state officials in the presence of the minister.

The Silicon Valley-based global firm has been eyeing the India for a greater pie of its growing smartphones market, in which it sold 2.5 million iPhones as against a whopping 29 million by its Korean rival Samsung.

[lookcatalog/Flickr] Apple agreed a special tax rate with Ireland in 1991. [lookcatalog/Flickr] Print The European Commission’s estimate that Apple owes Ireland up to €13 billion in a disputed tax ruling is unlikely to be altered greatly by Dublin’s calculations, the Irish finance minister said on Thursday (2 February). The Commission ordered Apple to pay Ireland the unpaid taxes after ruling in August that the iPhone maker won sweetheart tax deals from Dublin amounting to illegal state aid. The Irish government and Apple have appealed the demand. Irish parliament backs Apple tax appeal after angry debate Ireland’s parliament battled through an ill-tempered debate on Wednesday to vote in favour of appealing a European Commission ruling ordering the country to collect billions of euros in unpaid taxes from tech giant Apple. EurActiv.com The Commission said it expected that the amount owed would total €13bn plus interest but required Ireland to calculate the exact sums based on the methodology designed and set out in the ruling. “So far my officials haven’t indicated to me that it’s not going to seriously overrun the €13bn or come seriously short of the €13bn, but there are other years to be assessed and so on,” Finance Minister Michael Noonan told a parliamentary committee, referring to the ten-year period the calculations are based on. Apple, Ireland lines of defence diverge in state aid case In its challenge of the European Commission’s €13bn recovery decision, Ireland does not agree with Apple’s position that almost the entirety of its profits are generated by R&D, and should therefore be taxed in the US, PaRR has learned. EurActiv.com Noonan said Irish officials were still negotiating the terms of a ring-fenced escrow fund where the back taxes will be held pending the outcome of the appeals process, which the Irish government has said could take four or five years. Ireland requested an extension to complete the collection of the funds after a formal deadline for doing so elapsed last month. The EU’s antitrust regulator said on Tuesday (31 January) that the Commission was satisfied with Ireland’s progress to date.   Background On 30 August, the executive concluded that two tax rulings adopted by Ireland substantially and artificially lowered tax paid by Apple in the country since 1991. Apple Sales International and Apple Operations Europe, two Irish subsidiaries of the US parent, hold the IP rights to sell and manufacture Apple products outside North and South America. The rulings claimed almost all the sales profits booked by these subsidiaries were internally attributed to a head office that had no premises and were not subject to tax. The European Commission held that in 2011, 97% of the €16bn profit reported by Apple Sales International was allocated to the untaxed head office in Ireland. This percentage increased to 99% in 2014. Together with the US government, Apple is arguing that these profits will be taxed upon repatriation to the US.

Apple will make iPhones in India at Bengaluru facility. Although there is no mention on the production date, some media reports say that it is expected to begin in June. The Government of Karnataka has said it welcomes Apple Inc.'s proposal to commence initial manufacturing operations in the city. "Apple's intentions to manufacture in Bengaluru will foster cutting edge technology eco system and supply chain development in the state, which are critical for India to compete globally," an official release signed by Karnataka IT Minister Priyank Kharge said. It said Apple's representatives, led by Priya Balasubramaniam, VP iPhone operations, Ali Khanafer (Head, Government Affairs),Dheeraj Chugh (Director,iphone operations) and Priyesh Povanna (Country Counsel) met Ministers and officials of the Karnataka Government and had positive discussions about the initiatives in manufacturing and possible collaborations with state Government in other areas. The release did not detail about what the initial manufacturing operations would be. However, reports quoting highly placed government sources had earlier said that the iconic iPhones would be manufactured in Bengaluru by Wistron, a Taiwanese OEM maker for Apple. Local manufacturing is expected to help Apple price its phones more competitively in India as it currently attracts 12.5 percent additional duty on imports. This would be Apple's second big project for Bengaluru. In May, Apple had announced setting up a design and development accelerator in the city to grow the iOS developer community. The announcement was made as part of the visit of Apple CEO Tim Cook to India. Apple ships iPhones to India from Foxconn Technology firm in China and sells them through distributors and retailers, besides iStore and Imagine stores. Though the central government has told Apple that it would have to source 30 percent of its components from Indian suppliers, Apple is seeking a 15-year tax holiday on import of components and equipment. With many states wooing Apple for its Indian plant in their cities, the iPhones maker has been exploring a best deal, including tax reliefs and exemptions from local sourcing.

The US company has tapped Taiwan's Wistron Corp to put together its phones in the tech capital of Bangalore in Karnataka, said Priyank Kharge, the state's information technology minister. Apple executives met with him in January and confirmed the timeline, he said in an interview. The start of iPhone assembly in India comes after months of speculation on Apple's plan for the market, which is led by rival Samsung Electronics. It signals a renewed focus on the country, where it just scrapes into the top 10, as growth begins to slow in China and other more mature markets. Apple is said to have put forward a long list of demands - including a 15-year tax holiday to import components and equipment - in negotiations with India's federal government. "Apple's iPhones will be made in Bangalore and all devices will be targeted at the domestic market," said Kharge, IT minister for Karnataka, of which Bangalore is the capital. Kharge said the state will help Apple if it decides to turn to other contract manufacturers in the region. "We did not discuss any other incentives," he said. Apple didn't immediately respond to an e-mailed request for comment. Apple chief executive officer Tim Cook said in an earnings call this week that India is "the place to be." The company shipped 2.5 million iPhones into the country in 2016. While that is its best year ever in terms of revenues and sales, it only ranked 10th among vendors in the December quarter according Counterpoint Research. Apple accounts for less than 2 per cent of shipments in India, where an estimated 750 million smartphones will be sold by 2020. The devices will be assembled through a plant on Bangalore's outskirts operated by Wistron, a Taiwanese contract manufacturer.

This one alleges that the company forced users to upgrade to iOS 7 by essentially breaking FaceTime in iOS 6. The move to render FaceTime useless in iOS 6, according to the lawsuit, was primarily driven by Apple wanting to avoid paying increasingly high data costs to Akamai. Today’s suit alleges, however, that the forced upgrade to use FaceTime rendered older devices like iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S unusable. As detailed by AppleInsider, much of the basis for this lawsuit was made public in Apple’s patent battle with VirnetX. When FaceTime originally launched, there were two technologies used for connecting iPhones together. The first used a peer-to-peer standard to directly transfer audio and video between users. The other used a “relay method,” relying on third-party servers from Akami to transfer the data between users. The latter method accounted for a report 5 percent to 10 percent of FaceTime calls at first. Come 2012, however, Apple was found guilty of violating patents owned by VirnetX with its peer-to-peer tech, thus forcing the company to switch to the relay method for all FaceTime calls and data. Because of this, Apple started to incur millions of dollars in monthly data fees to Akami. According to information made public in Apple’s patent retrial with VirnetX last year, the company incurred $50 million in fees between April 2013 and September 2013, coming out to around $8.3 million per month. With that much leaving Apple’s pockets per month, executives started to investigate ways to reduce the cost of FaceTime. Today’s lawsuit, for instance, points to an internal email with the subject line “Ways to Reduce Relay Usage.” After paying the millions of dollars in data fees for a year, Apple saw a way to move away from the relay technology with FaceTime and use a peer-to-peer standard that didn’t infringe on VirnetX patents. With iOS 7, FaceTime made the switch. The problem, however, was that some customers continued to remain on iOS 6, forcing Apple to continue to pay data fees to Akamai. Today’s lawsuit, however, alleges that Apple realized it could force people to either upgrade to iOS 7 or break FaceTime on iOS 6 by causing an important digital certificate to expire earlier. After doing that, Apple blamed the newfound iOS 6 FaceTime issues on a bug, explaining the “problem” in a security post on its support site: If you started to have issues making or receiving FaceTime calls after April 16, 2014, your device or your friend’s device may have encountered a bug resulting from a device certificate that expired on that date. Updating both devices to the latest software will resolve this issue. Adding more fuel to this fire, today’s lawsuit cites an email chain between engineers. “Hey, guys. I’m looking at the Akamai contract for next year. I understand we did something in April around iOS 6 to reduce relay utilization,” an Apple engineer manager stated. Another engineer replied, “It was a big user of relay bandwidth. We broke iOS 6, and the only way to get FaceTime working again is to upgrade to iOS 7.” The lawsuit also alleges that in pushing users to iOS 7, the company rendered older devices such as the iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S useless: For iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S users, for example, the coerced move to iOS 7 subjected their devices to slowness, system crashes, erratic behavior and/or the elimination of their ability to use critical functions on their phone. As succinctly stated in one of the media reports that discussed these widespread functionality problems, “the older handsets buckle under the weight of the new software.” Thus, for millions of Apple’s customers, a move to iOS 7 would significantly harm the functionality of their device. All in all, the lawsuit alleges that Apple violated the California unfair competition law and is liable for trespass to chattels, which means that Apple is responsible for interfering with another’s possessions. As for what will come of this lawsuit/conspiracy theory remains to be seen.

Apple's intentions to make iPhones in Bengaluru will foster cutting-edge technology ecosystem & supply chain development in the state.— Priyank Kharge (@PriyankKharge) February 2, 2017 Apple has been in talks with the Indian government for several months about the possibilities of making iPhones in the country. The company’s team met government officials on January 25 to discuss iPhone manufacturing in the country. Last month, it was reported that Apple has selected Taiwanese OEM maker, Wistron as the primary iPhone manufacturer. Information Technology Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said last month that India would consider Apple’s request for incentives to invest in the country with an “open mind.” In last May, Apple had announced setting up a design and development accelerator in the city to grow the iOS developer community. Apple shipped record 2.5 million iPhone units in India during 2016. The company topped Samsung as top smartphone vendor in Q4 2016 and shipped record 1.47 billion smartphones in 2016.

Courtesy: Apple January 31st 2017 3 days ago /video/video.news.com.au/Technology/ Apple CEO Tim Cook delivered results that show the iPhone has bounced back after disappointing sales results. Picture: Andrew Burton/Getty Images/AFP Rod ChesterNews Corp Australia Network APPLE has bounced back from a nine month streak of iPhone sales slumps with the dual-lens camera of the iPhone 7 Plus helping to drive sales to a record high. The predictions of doom for Apple when they dumped the headphone jack in the iPhone 7 proved to be unwarranted, with sales for the iPhone back into growth despite many people saying they would skip last year’s update and wait for the iPhone 8 which is expected to be a major upgrade later this year. Apple CEO Tim Cook delivered the quarterly results and after several disappointing quarters the launch of the iPhone 7, and more significantly the bigger iPhone 7 Plus with dual-lens camera, has seen a five per cent rise in sales of iPhones to reach 78.3 million for the quarter. The dual-lens camera of the iPhone 7 Plus helped to drive Apple sales to a record high. Picture: AFP/ Josh EdelsonSource:AFP While the iPhone is the cash cow for the Cupertino-based tech giant, it was not just the iPhone driving the revenue up to US$78.4 billion. Mac sales, perhaps helped by the launch of the MacBook Pro, were up 1.4 per cent to 5.37 million. Apple posted a record quarterly result of US$78.4 billion for a US$17.9 billion profit. “We sold more iPhones than ever before and set all-time revenue records for iPhone, Services, Mac and Apple Watch,” Cook said. The one product where Apple now has serious concerns is the iPad, which was 19 per cent down on sales and now has recorded three years of declining sales. Apple sold 13.1 million iPads in the quarter and while it can still claim to be the leader in tablets that sales figure is a drop from 15.1 million a year ago. Figures can be used to tell many stories, but the real story of today’s figures is the growth in the number of people opting to buy Apple’s biggest phablet, the 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus. Apple sold 24.5 million iPhone 7 Plus phones in the quarter, which is a 55 per cent jump compared to the sales of the iPhone 6s Plus a year ago. Well the iPhone Plus is no longer “just the bigger iPhone” consumers clearly see it as the iPhone to have https://t.co/a9W5hHGWAB— carolina milanesi (@caro_milanesi) January 31, 2017 Since Apple began selling it’s flagship iPhone in two sizes, the differences between the iPhone and the Plus has been mainly one of size. People bought the phone that suited them the best and the bigger phone didn’t win over everyone, particularly after the “bendgate” problems with the iPhone 6 Plus. But with the release of the iPhone 7 Plus, that has a dual-lens camera unlike the iPhone 7, punters had a reason to switch to a bigger phone — and clearly many have. Given no of iPhones sold, seems consumers could care less about a non-standard headphone jack. https://t.co/s3wiOfGPGL via @usatoday— Ed Baig (@edbaig) January 31, 2017 Next to the iPhone, the biggest money maker for Apple continues to be its services business, which includes digital music, Apple Pay, cloud storage and apps. Revenue for services jumped to US$7.2 billion for the quarter, up 18 per cent on a year ago, driven in part by a spike in app sales with the App Store recording its best month ever in December. Apple says revenue from the App Store was double the revenue from Google Play last year, further confirming the view that iPhone users are more likely to pay for apps than users of Android phones. Apple’s Services segment is on track to be big enough to be its own Fortune 100 company this year and Apple says it expects to double the size of the segment within four years. It wasn’t all good news from Apple, with revenue down from the crucial China market. Cook also needs to find a way to turnaround the iPad market, with the release of two iPad Pro models in recent years not enough to turn it around.

 Apple's CEO sees a way to bring back billions in cash from overseas Steve Kovach Jan. 31, 2017, 6:34 PM 9,337 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple CEO Tim Cook.Getty Images, Justin Sullivan Apple may have a way to bring back to the US some of the billions in cash it's storing overseas. CEO Tim Cook said on the company's earnings call Tuesday that he expects congress to pass tax reform this year. That tax reform could loosen up the taxes Apple would have to pay if it brings back cash from overseas, one of the key reasons it continues to store most of its cash outside the US. "I am optimistic on what I'm hearing for some tax reform this year," Cook said on the call. "It seems there are people in both parties that would favor repatriation as part of that," he added, referring to bringing the overseas cash to the US. Apple has $230.2 billion in cash overseas, according to its earnings report Tuesday. Cook was in Washington, D.C. last week meeting with people like Sen. Orrin Hatch and President Trump's son in law and senior adviser Jared Kushner, although it's unclear what was discussed. Even before the election, Cook has said that he was confident tax reform would happen in 2017, regardless of who won the presidency. Read more about Apple's earnings over at our live blog.

By Adamya SharmaAdamya Sharma Published Date 03 - Feb - 2017 | Last Updated 03 - Feb - 2017 Tweet   Xiaomi Redmi 3S Prime (Dark Grey, 32GB) 8999 The final word seems to be in. Apple, the Cupertino based tech behemoth, will manufacture iPhones in India very soon. As per a release by the Karnataka Government, Apple will be 'making in India' out of a facility in Bengaluru. The release welcomes Apple's proposal to manufacture iPhones in India and to "commence initial manufacturing operations" in the state. News of Apple's India manufacturing plans was first heard of in December, post which the company held talks with many senior government officials to finalise the terms of its operations in India. It is not clear if Apple got the heavy tax exemption approvals it was seeking from the government, but relaxations were announced for those seeking to make in India, in the budget. Back in January, Apple officials also held talks with officials from the departments of commerce, industrial policy and promotion (DIPP), revenue, environment and forest, electronics and information technology (DeITY) to seek incentives such as long-term duty exemptions.  As per the release, which was signed by Karnataka IT Minister, Priyank Kharge, Apple "will foster cutting edge technology ecosystem and supply chain development in the state, which are critical for India to compete globally." However, the release does not mention a timeline for the start of iPhone manufacturing in Bengaluru. Reports suggest Apple, along with Taiwanese OEM, Wistron, will begin manufacturing the devices starting June, 2017. The Apple-Wistron manufacturing facility will be based out of Bengaluru's industrial hub Peenya. However, sources told Reuters that no deal or MoU has been finalised between Apple and the state government till now. In fact, the state IT Minister went on to tweet about the development as well, almost confirming Apple's plans. The tweet was later deleted by the minister. The release went on to describe how Karnataka's state officials met with seniour management from Apple including - Priya Balasubramaniam, VP, iPhone Operations, Dheeraj Chugh, Director, iPhone operations, and more. The government also said that it was looking to collaborate with Apple in other areas of innovation as well. This will be Apple's third global iPhone assembly unit, putting India on the radar of the world's most iconic and valuable company. Apple's entry to India as a manufacturer should be a signal to other smartphone makers looking to dip their toes in the Indian manufacturing space. It could also prompt other brands like Xiaomi and the world's third-largest smartphone maker Huawei, to ask for additional incentives from the government for their existing assembly lines in India. Apple is expected to start assembling iPhones in the country initially, with plans to manufacture the device end-to-end in the near future.

Late on Thursday evening, Priyank Kharge, Information and Technology Minister for Karnataka, said on Twitter, “Glad to announce initial manufacturing operations of the world’s most valued company: Apple, in Karnataka”. However, by Friday morning, the minister had deleted the said tweet.A source familiar with the matter told Reuters that no deal, or memorandum of understanding had so far been finalised with the Karnataka government. The person, who asked not to be named, said if Apple did go ahead with plans to begin assembling the iPhone, it was likely to do so initially at a plant being set up by its Taiwanese manufacturing partner Wistron Corp at Peenya on the outskirts of the tech hub of Bengaluru, Karnataka. Apple was not immediately reachable for comment. Cupertino, California-based Apple, is keen to assemble its phones in India, one of the world’s fastest growing smartphone markets. Apple representatives met with federal and state government officials in India last week, as it is lobbying hard for a raft of tax and sourcing concessions from India, before it begins to assemble iPhones in the country. Following the meetings, Apple said it appreciated the open and constructive dialogue it held with Indian officials, around the expansion of its local operations in the country. Any final decision around manufacturing in India however, is likely to still be contingent on the government’s willingness to concede ground on the concessions sought by the company. Last month, Information Technology Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said India would consider Apple’s request for incentives to invest in the country with an “open mind.” On its part, the government of Karnataka said on Thursday it was “committed to new initiatives in any sector for manufacturing and will provide a conducive environment for investment.” Original copy by Reuters edited by Gadgets 360 Staff Leave a comment Click here to cancel reply.

But that was when they first came out. When I had a review unit supplied by Apple (AAPL). Before I spent $3,000 on my own, suped-up, top-of-the-line 13-inch MacBook Pro. I know: That’s an obscene amount of money. But this is my main machine, my livelihood. If you add up the hours, I spend more time with my laptop than I do with my bed, car, or home. I figured it would be worth the splurge. As it turns out, that’s a big Yes and a big No. Life with this thing has been a roller coaster: one emotional whiplash after another. “Cool!” “Oh, NO!” “Cool!” “Oh, NO!” View photos My $3,000 life companion.More Looking good on paper Four things attracted me to this new laptop. First, you can get it with a 1-terabyte “hard drive” (actually a giant flash drive). I’m a big photos-and-videos guy. I’ve spent the last five years struggling against the storage limitations of MacBook Airs. I’m ready. Second, the size. This thing is at least an inch smaller than the MacBook Air all the way around. Apple shaved away most of the margin around the screen. I’ve wrestled with my laptop on an airplane tray for the last time. Third, the screen. I’m finally ready for Retina resolution on my main machine—and having enough brightness to light up a runway doesn’t hurt, either. Fourth, being able to log in with a touch, thanks to the fingerprint reader. (You can read about the Touch Bar here. It’s super handy to be able to adjust the volume or brightness with one quick swipe, and navigating a video is super quick—but otherwise, I don’t use it much.) View photos It’s nice to be able to adjust the volume or brightness with a single swipe.More I knew I was also getting far better speakers; a much bigger trackpad; the Touch Bar above the keyboard; and four USB-C jacks instead of the usual USB, video, and power jacks. I didn’t think any of those things would affect me. At the time. Up: The power thing I know everybody bellyaches about the loss of the standard jacks. But USB-C is awesome, man. You can’t plug this cable upside-down. There’s no right end or wrong end. A single cable carries audio, video, power, and data. The whole industry is going to USB-C—phones, tablets, laptops, desktops—so get used to it. Right off the bat, I love that you can plug the MacBook Pro’s power cord into either side, since any of its four USB-C jacks can accommodate it. Useful more often than you’d think. Yeah, it’s sad that we’ve lost Apple’s MagSafe magnetic power-cord connector. But the fact that we don’t have to buy Apple’s power cords anymore easily makes up for it. For example, I like to have a spare charger next to my bed, and another one in my laptop bag for travel. But I don’t like paying $70 or $80 to Apple for spare cords. Now, I don’t have to. Any old USB-C charging cord will work. You can get power from the wall, from your car’s cigarette jack, from one of those backup batteries, or even from another USB-C laptop! Like mouth-to-mouth resuscitation for laptops. I bought a $27 Dell charger and a Udoli one for $35. The Dell one lights up to show that it’s getting power, which the new Apple cord doesn’t. The Udoli one has a regular USB jack on the side for charging your phone or Fitbit (FIT), which the Apple cord also doesn’t. View photos My $35 second charger. Bye-bye, $80 adapters!More Now, in theory, any USB-C device can charge from any USB-C charger; the voltage and whatnot is adjusted automatically. You can even charge the MacBook Pro from a phone charger. It’ll take forever, but it’ll charge. Read More My cheapo Dell charger supplies 27 watts; the Udoli offes 45 watts. Neither, in other words, charges as fast as the Apple charger (61 watts). And the Dell charger does a weird thing when the laptop is closed: It chimes every couple of minutes, as though the power is being unplugged and replugged. I don’t care. I got away with price murder on these spare chargers, and they’re smaller and handier than Apple’s. Oh! And I also bought, for $15, a charger that plugs into my car cigarette lighter. It juices up the laptop great (I’m frequently the passenger on long drives to the airport), and has an extra USB jack for charging something else. View photos Power in the car!More Down: The Trackpad Apple made its new trackpad huge, and I can’t figure out why. What does that get you? What it gets me is accidental clicks, caused by my left thumb as it hovers while I type. My cursor or insertion point suddenly pops into the wrong place or the wrong window. Apparently, this problem is much worse if you’ve turned on Tap to Click (which requires only touching the trackpad, not actually clicking down on it, to register a click). I’ve solved the problem by taping a piece of cardboard to the trackpad, in essence shrinking it. Real classy. View photos My solution to accidental clicks.More Up: The Keyboard The key travel has gotten dissed for its shallowness, but I can really fly typing on this keyboard. It’s crisp and firm. Loud as hell, but crisp and firm. Neutral: The adapter thing Of course, switching into MacBook Pro Land means getting adapters for everything that normally plugs into USB. Sometimes, that just takes the form of a $6 replacement cable; sometimes, you need a $3 plug adapter. Everybody talks about how many dongles they’ll need, but that’s not been my experience. I still have one Fitibit cord, one MiFi cord, one digital camera charging cord, and so on; it’s just that some of them have an adapter plug on the end. View photos There’s no USB-C Fitbit cord, so I popped a $3 adapter onto the end.More I did have to buy a new Lightning-to-USB-C cable for my iPhone. Apple’s version is $19, which is absurd. I found this awesome one on Amazon (AMZN) for $9. It has a sturdy, non-tangling nylon fabric outer shell, available in three metallic colors to match the three MacBook Pro colors. View photos My new Lightning cable. (I chose gold so it’d show up in the depths of my laptop bag.)More I’ve read here and there that cheapo Chinese USB-C adapters and cables can be glitchy. But all the ones I’ve picked up on Amazon have worked like a champ, except for the Dell dinging-power-cord thing. Down: No card slot I deeply, deeply miss a memory-card slot. Used to be, transferring photos from a camera was as easy as popping out its memory card and slamming it into my MacBook Air. Now I have to go looking for my $8 USB-C card reader, or hook up the camera with a cable. I no longer have any video-output jack, either—like VGA, HDMI, or Mini-DVI. So for $45, I bought a multi-jack dongle that offers both VGA and HDMI—and Ethernet and a regular USB jack. So I’m covered there. Up: One-cable docking station I spend a lot of time doing book layouts, so I sprang $524 for the LG UltraFine 4K 21-inch monitor. What’s amazing about it is not just the gorgeous image; it’s that one USB-C cable connects it to the MacBook. That single cable charges the laptop, carries audio and video to the monitor’s screen and speakers, and conducts data both directions (there are four USB-C jacks on the back of the monitor). View photos Presenting: The one-cable docking station.More I used to hook up my MacBook Air to a docking contraption every time I came home from the road. Now, I plug in one cable, and my entire desktop system is ready to go. It’s fairly awesome. Down: Shorter battery life Apple says this smaller laptop has a smaller battery than the MacBook Air—and yet that it still gets the same 10 hours of work time. That’s baloney. There’s been a lot of confusion and analysis about why the MacBook Pro does or does not get the battery life it’s supposed to. But this much I can say for sure: You get better battery life if you install the latest Mac OS version, 10.12.3. And if you keep the screen dimmer than full brightness. And if you don’t do heavy-lifting work like Photoshop, video editing, and games. This much I can also say for sure: No matter what you do, you won’t get as much life out of this battery as you would doing exactly the same work on the MacBook Air. It’s a 33% smaller battery; it’s not going to have the same capacity. I usually get six or seven hours from it. I wasn’t ready for that, and it’s a real drag. Thank goodness I’ve got chargers all around me. Whiplash If you’re a Mac person and can’t afford to switch to Windows, then the new MacBook Pro is it. Apple doesn’t intend to update the MacBook Air or the older MacBook Pros anymore. The future is this or nothing. But you know what? This really isn’t a MacBook at all. I mean, it doesn’t have the same anything. Screen, jacks, power cord, keyboard, battery, trackpad…it has almost nothing in common with previous Apple laptops. It’s much better in some ways, and much worse in others. You’ve been warned; keep hands and feet inside the tram at all times.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India US World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Budget 2017 Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Smartphones Make in India: Apple iPhone production in Bengaluru to commence soon Apple has sent a proposal to the Karnataka government and if approved, Apple's Taiwanese manufacturer Wistron Corp will start assembling iPhones at its Peenya plant. Rohit KVN   February 3, 2017 10:02 IST Make in India: Apple iPhone production in Bengaluru to commence soonCreative Commons There were rumours last month that Apple's OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) partner Wistron Corp has decided to set up an iPhone assembly plant in Peenya, an industrial hub in Bengaluru. But back then, neither the company nor the Central or state government had confirmed the reports. Now, it has come to light that Apple has sent an official proposal to the Karnataka government to build an iPhone manufacturing unit in the state's capital city. Also read: Apple registers record quarterly revenue: Thanks to iPhone 7 sales or Galaxy Note7 ban? "Apple's intentions to manufacture in Bengaluru will foster cutting edge technology eco system and supply chain development in the state, which are critical for India to compete globally," Karnataka Information and Technology and Tourism Minister Priyank M Kharge said in a statement. Karnataka government ministers and officials are said to have had positive discussions with Apple's representatives -- Priya Balasubramaniam (vice president, iPhone operations), Ali Khanafer (head, government affairs), Dheeraj Chugh (director, iPhone operations) and Priyesh Povanna (country counsel) about iPhone manufacturing plans. If all things fall in place, Apple's supply partner Wistron Corp is expected to commence iPhone production anytime between April and June. Apple's intentions to make iPhones in Bengaluru will foster cutting-edge technology ecosystem & supply chain development in the state.— Priyank Kharge (@PriyankKharge) February 2, 2017 Make in India: Apple iPhone production in Bengaluru to commence soonPriyank Kharge (@PriyankKharge) via Twitter The news comes just a week after the Cupertino-based company's officials held a formal meeting with an inter-ministerial group consisting commerce, industrial policy and promotion (DIPP), revenue, environment and forest, electronics and information technology (DeITY) on January 25, to seek incentives for setting up domestic manufacturing unit. In the Union Budget 2017 announced on February 1, Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has also hiked allocation for Make-in-India initiative's Modified Special Incentive Package Scheme (MSIPS) and the Electronics Development Fund (EDF) to an all-time high of Rs 745 crore. However, Jaitley slapped Special Additional Duty (SAD) on the import of PCBs (Printed Circuit Board), which is one of the main components of a mobile phone. This move apparently offsets the incentives offered on MSIPS and EDF schemes. Apple iPhones, which are currently sold in India, are priced higher than other international markets as the government imposes customs duty (around 12.5 percent on MRP) on imported consumer electronics goods. So, even if Apple doesn't get any special tax breaks, there will no customs duty on locally manufactured (or assembled) iPhones and definitely, there will be at least around Rs 10,000 to Rs 12,000 reduction in prices. We believe the iPhone 8 series scheduled to be unveiled later this year will be priced similar to global markets. Watch this space for latest news on Apple products.

Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet are said to be writing Trump a letter expressing their concern about the order on immigration he signed last Friday, and other changes to immigration policy he may plan. The letter, a draft of which has been published by a number of media outlets, including Recode.net, highlights the companies' dependence on immigrants for their success, and warns that the new policy could affect many visa holders already contributing to the U.S. economy. [ Further reading: Tech companies come out swinging against immigration ban ] Friday's executive order bars refugees from Syria, and temporarily suspends immigration from Syria and six other predominantly Moslem countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. Amazon.com is one of the companies supporting a legal challenge to the executive order, which it says is disrupting its business and affecting employees. Apple may also consider taking legal action, CEO Tim Cook said Wednesday. The biological father of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs was from Syria, and the company "would not exist without immigration, let alone thrive and innovate the way we do," Cook wrote in an email to employees earlier in the week. One area of immigration policy that Trump hasn't touched yet is the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which protects some immigrant minors already in the country from deportation if they can get a high school diploma, among other criteria. Trump is known to be considering changes to DACA, but the draft letter attributed to the companies cautions: "Removing these protections by barring renewals would effectively end the program and eliminate the ability for these Dreamers to work and live without the fear of deportation." DACA is just one strand of the country's web of immigration rules, the draft said, offering to help the president refine it. "As you contemplate changes to the nation’s complex and interconnected immigration policies, whether business and employment-based visas, refugees, or DACA, we hope that you will use us as a resource to help achieve immigration policies that both support the work of American businesses and reflect American values," the draft letter concludes. Representatives for Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the letter or confirmation of its content.

The U.S. company has tapped Taiwan’s Wistron Corp. to put together its phones in the tech capital of Bangalore in Karnataka, said Priyank Kharge, the state’s information technology minister. Apple executives met with him in January and confirmed the timeline, he said in an interview. The start of iPhone assembly in India comes after months of speculation on Apple’s plan for the market, which is led by rival Samsung Electronics Co. It signals a renewed focus on the country, where it just scrapes into the top 10, as growth begins to slow in China and other more mature markets. The Cupertino, California-based company is said to have put forward a long list of demands in negotiations with India’s federal government, including a 15-year tax holiday to import components and equipment. “Apple’s iPhones will be made in Bangalore and all devices will be targeted at the domestic market,” said Kharge, IT minister for Karnataka, of which Bangalore is the capital. Kharge said the state will help Apple if it decides to turn to other contract manufacturers in the region. “We did not discuss any other incentives,” he said. Apple didn’t respond to an e-mailed request for comment. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said on an earnings call this week that India is “the place to be.” He visited the country for the first time last May as he sought government approval for Apple to open its own stores -- a step the company deems critical to growing the iPhone user base across the country. Over the long run however, Apple needs to meet requirements that single-brand retailers source 30 percent of components from within India. Manufacturing locally will help with that. Making iPhones locally could also score brownie points with the national government. Prime Minister Narendra Modi wants companies to make products in the country as part of his “Make in India” policy, aimed at reaping the benefits that come from manufacturing facilities and jobs. The company shipped 2.5 million iPhones into the country in 2016. While that was its best year ever in terms of revenues and sales, it only ranked 10th among vendors in the December quarter according to Counterpoint Research. Apple accounts for less than 2 percent of shipments in India, where an estimated 750 million smartphones will be sold by 2020. While Indian consumers currently buy mainly cheaper devices made by Samsung and Chinese brands such as Oppo, Apple believes rising incomes will make the premium-priced iPhone more attractive over time. Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up Apple doesn’t manufacture devices itself, but rather partners with contract manufacturers to handle the capital intensive demands of building factories and hiring staff. Its Indian phones will be assembled through a plant on Bangalore’s outskirts operated by Wistron, a Taiwanese contract manufacturer, bypassing usual partners such as Hon Hai Precision Industry Ltd. Hon Hai, the main listed arm of Taiwan’s Foxconn Technology Group, is said to be an option in future. “In the longer term, it’s a great move,” Cook said on this week’s post-earnings call. “We are in discussions on a number of things, including retail stores, and fully intend to invest significantly in the country.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

An Apple team, led by iPhone Operations Vice-President Priya Balasubramaniam, Government Affairs Head Ali Khanafer, iPhone Operations Director Dheeraj Chugh and Country Counsel Priyesh Povanna discussed the proposals with the state officials in the presence of the minister. "We welcome Apple's proposal to commence initial manufacturing operations in Karnataka. Its intentions to make iPhones in Bengaluru will foster the cutting-edge technology ecosystem and supply chain development in the state, which are critical for India to compete globally," said Kharge. "Apple's decision to make iPhones in Bengaluru has enhanced the city's reputation as the most preferred destination for foreign investment and validation of our policies to foster manufacturing, innovation and investments in the state," he said. The Silicon Valley-based global firm has been eyeing the India for a greater pie of its growing smartphones market, in which it sold 2.5 million iPhones as against a whopping 29 million by its Korean rival Samsung. Apple ships iPhones to India from Foxconn Technology firm in China and sells them through distributors and retailers, besides iStore and Imagine stores. Though the central government has told Apple that it would have to source 30 per cent of its components from Indian suppliers, Apple is seeking a 15-year tax holiday on import of components and equipment. With many states wooing Apple for its Indian plant in their cities, the iPhones maker has been exploring a best deal, including tax reliefs and exemptions from local sourcing.

As the world’s largest firm by market valuation, it has not disappointed the public in terms of its sales volume. After three consecutive quarters of overall year-on-year decline, Apple’s overall revenues rebounded during the last big holiday season, and shares rose more than 3 per cent, now only about 6 per cent off the record high of February 2015, when the firm was valued at $775 billion. Despite its stellar performance, however, Apple still has no shortage of critics, whose ranks have seemed only to grow since Tim Cook has taken the reins. This may also explain why Apple is glaringly undervalued compared to other tech giants. Apple’s ratio of price to earnings per share (P/E), which shows what the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its current earnings, sits at around 15. By the same measure, Microsoft and Google are hovering at about 30, Facebook at 50, and Amazon, the most extreme outlier of all, is close to 200. To put it differently, investors are willing to bet thirteen times more on Amazon than on Apple for every dollar earned by either company. How could that be possible? ● The Apple Core: More than fifteen years ago, when Apple first introduced the iPod in October 2001, the project was set to meet an impossibly short deadline imposed from the top down by Steve Jobs. To do so, Jon Rubinstein, then head of hardware, had to swiftly assemble an engineering team that focused on integrating standardised third-party components into a small package. Importantly, the prime differentiation of the iPod was not its physical design but its complementary offering, iTunes. Jobs reportedly insisted that the iTunes user interface be modelled on Palm’s HotSync software so that the iPod could transfer songs seamlessly from iTunes. Apple’s commanding lead is therefore rooted in the flawless integration of hardware and software wrapped in an elegant industrial design. In 2007, while iPod sales were still going through the roof, Jobs launched the iPhone, which combined an iPod, a cell phone, and Internet access into a single device. Although iPhone’s exclusive touch-screen at the time attracted much attention from the general public, what sustained iPhone’s differentiation against other competitors was the App Store. By providing software development kits to independent software developers at a low cost, Apple became the leading platform architect of the smartphone industry. Through its App Store and mobile devices, the company fostered the development of what has become the largest mobile app marketplace. These two core capabilities, the integration of hardware, software, and design and the orchestration of a deep network of independent app developers, have sustained the growth of iPhone over the past ten years. According to BMO Capital Markets, during the third quarter of 2016, Apple took home 103.6 per cent of the smartphone industry’s profits – arithmetically impossible if not for the fact that competitors actually lost money in the sector. With so much success, what’s there to complain about? ● Why investors are fidgeting: It turns out the stock price of a firm is no more than the net present value of all future cash flow. If managers grow the company’s earnings at the rate the market expects, the firm’s share price grows only at the rate of its cost of capital, as those expectations have already been factored into the current share price. the only way to increase a company’s stock price is to provide constant ‘upside surprises’ by repeatedly delivering growth that the market has not foreseen To persistently create shareholder value at a greater rate, managers must do something that investors have not already taken into account – and they must do so over and over again. In other words, the only way to increase a company’s stock price is to provide constant “upside surprises” by repeatedly delivering growth that the market has not foreseen. For this reason, when Apple reported its earnings last Tuesday, investors looked at its services revenue, not just at iPhone sales. At the deepest level, there has always been the lurking fear that the two core capabilities of Apple are being rapidly replicated by competition. ● The roaring old rivals: Just before Christmas last year, Microsoft revealed the Surface Studio, a 28-inch all-in-one desktop that can flatten out into a digital drafting table. Its immersive computing experience, geared for visual artists, allows designers to lean over the display horizontally as they would over a drafting table. The Surface Dial, a physical puck that one plops on the screen, triggers a menu of functions specific to the app being used. “When we can change the colour while you’re painting without even picking up the [stylus’] tip, that’s not just as good as real life – that’s better,” said one user. This is exactly the sort of integration between physical accessories and operating systems that has made Apple distinctive, except this time the thunder came from its old rival, Microsoft. Meanwhile, Google has launched its Pixel phone. Hardwired into Pixel is Google Assistant, similar to Microsoft’s Cortana, Apple’s Siri, and Amazon’s Alexa. But because Google has acquired considerable knowledge about the world, having spent the past 18 years parsing data for search queries, the conversational assistant appears to be far more intelligent than its contemporaries. When asked, “Play the Shakira song from Zootopia,” Google assistant knows which track to play. The assistant is also capable of offering detailed advice on local businesses and directions with traffic predictions, thanks to Google Maps. Your favourite holiday will even display when you casually say, “Show me my pictures of the beach from last summer.” All these mean the product differentiation between Apple and others is narrowing. To suggest Apple is running into some sort of existential crisis is, of course, absurd. After Steve Jobs departed, CEO Cook has more than doubled the company’s net profit to an astounding $53 billion per year. Yet, as the stock market suggests, most investors believe Google and Microsoft will catch up fast. As artificial intelligence and digital assistants are gathering steam, Apple must learn some new tricks before it’s too late.

Apple will make iPhones in India at Bengaluru facility. Although there is no mention on the production date, some media reports say that it is expected to begin in June. The Government of Karnataka has said it welcomes Apple Inc.'s proposal to commence initial manufacturing operations in the city. "Apple's intentions to manufacture in Bengaluru will foster cutting edge technology eco system and supply chain development in the state, which are critical for India to compete globally," an official release signed by Karnataka IT Minister Priyank Kharge said. It said Apple's representatives, led by Priya Balasubramaniam, VP iPhone operations, Ali Khanafer (Head, Government Affairs),Dheeraj Chugh (Director,iphone operations) and Priyesh Povanna (Country Counsel) met Ministers and officials of the Karnataka Government and had positive discussions about the initiatives in manufacturing and possible collaborations with state Government in other areas. The release did not detail about what the initial manufacturing operations would be. However, reports quoting highly placed government sources had earlier said that the iconic iPhones would be manufactured in Bengaluru by Wistron, a Taiwanese OEM maker for Apple. Local manufacturing is expected to help Apple price its phones more competitively in India as it currently attracts 12.5 percent additional duty on imports. This would be Apple's second big project for Bengaluru. In May, Apple had announced setting up a design and development accelerator in the city to grow the iOS developer community. The announcement was made as part of the visit of Apple CEO Tim Cook to India. Apple ships iPhones to India from Foxconn Technology firm in China and sells them through distributors and retailers, besides iStore and Imagine stores. Though the central government has told Apple that it would have to source 30 percent of its components from Indian suppliers, Apple is seeking a 15-year tax holiday on import of components and equipment. With many states wooing Apple for its Indian plant in their cities, the iPhones maker has been exploring a best deal, including tax reliefs and exemptions from local sourcing.

"Apple's intentions to manufacture in Bengaluru will foster cutting edge technology eco system and supply chain development in the state, which are critical for India to compete globally," the government of the south Indian state said in a statement. "Apple's decision on initial manufacturing in Bengaluru has further enhanced the reputation of Bengaluru as the most preferred destination for foreign investment and further validation of the State Government Policies aimed at fostering manufacturing, innovation and investments in Karnataka," the statement added. Late on Thursday evening, Priyank Kharge, Information and Technology Minister for Karnataka, said on Twitter, "Glad to announce initial manufacturing operations of the world's most valued company: Apple, in Karnataka". However, by Friday morning, the minister had deleted the said tweet. A source familiar with the matter told Reuters that no deal, or memorandum of understanding had so far been finalised with the Karnataka government. The person, who asked not to be named, said if Apple did go ahead with plans to begin assembling the iPhone, it was likely to do so initially at a plant being set up by its Taiwanese manufacturing partner Wistron Corp at Peenya on the outskirts of the tech hub of Bengaluru, Karnataka. Apple was not immediately reachable for comment. Cupertino, California-based Apple, is keen to assemble its phones in India, one of the world's fastest growing smartphone markets. Apple representatives met with federal and state government officials in India last week, as it is lobbying hard for a raft of tax and sourcing concessions from India, before it begins to assemble iPhones in the country. Following the meetings, Apple said it appreciated the open and constructive dialogue it held with Indian officials, around the expansion of its local operations in the country. Any final decision around manufacturing in India however, is likely to still be contingent on the government's willingness to concede ground on the concessions sought by the company. Last month, Information Technology Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said India would consider Apple's request for incentives to invest in the country with an "open mind." On its part, the government of Karnataka said on Thursday it was "committed to new initiatives in any sector for manufacturing and will provide a conducive environment for investment."

According to the lawsuit, Apple forced users to upgrade so it could avoid payments on a data deal with Akamai. The class action found its genesis in internal Apple documents and emails disclosed in the VirnetX patent infringement lawsuit, which eventually ended in Apple paying $302 million after a retrial. Apple used two connection methods when launching FaceTime in 2010: a peer-to-peer method that created a direct connection between two iPhones and a relay method that used data servers from Akamai. When Apple's peer-to-peer FaceTime technology was found to infringe on VirnetX's patents in 2012, Apple began to shift toward Akamai's servers to handle iPhone-to-iPhone connections. A year later, Apple was paying $50 million in fees to Akamai, according to testimony from the VirnetX trial. The class-action lawsuit, pointing to an internal email titled "Ways to Reduce Relay Usage," alleges that the growing fees were beginning to bother Apple executives. Apple eventually solved the problem by creating new peer-to-peer technology that would debut in iOS 7. The class-action lawsuit, however, alleges that Apple created a fake bug that caused a digital certificate to prematurely expire on April 16, 2014, breaking FaceTime on iOS 6. Breaking FaceTime on iOS 6, the lawsuit claims, would allow Apple to save money on users who did not upgrade to iOS 7. At the time, Apple recognized the bug, publishing a support document saying that users who were having FaceTime connectivity problems after April 16, 2014 could update to the latest software to fix the issue. The same support document eventually removed the date "April 16, 2014," according to AppleInsider. The lawsuit later points to an internal Apple email chain in which an engineering manager mentions that they were looking at the Akamai contract for the upcoming year and understood that Apple "did something" to reduce usage of Akamai's services. Another engineer responded by pointing out iOS 6 leaned a lot on Akamai's services and that Apple "broke iOS 6" and the only way to fix FaceTime was to upgrade to iOS 7. Apple's developer page pegged iOS 7 adoption at 87 percent on April 7, 2014, nearly 10 days before Apple allegedly broke iOS 6. The lawsuit claims that forcing iPhone 4s and 4 users to upgrade to iOS 7 was harmful to them because the software would allegedly crash more and run more slowly. The lawsuit is seeking undisclosed damages and to prove Apple violated California's unfair competition law. Tags: lawsuit, FaceTime, VirnetX [ 60 comments ] Top Rated Comments (View all) autrefois 5 hours ago at 08:24 pm So what is the problem here? Apple doesn't charge for upgrades. They also stop supporting older software. They (allegedly) crippled software that was working fine to force people to upgrade. You don't see anything wrong with that? There are any number of reasons someone might not want to upgrade to the next OS, including the fact that older hardware tends to run newer software more slowly, as mentioned in the OP. Would it be okay if they intentionally put in a bug to prevent WiFi from working unless you upgraded? To prevent voicemail from working properly?

Rating: 5 Votes Altis 4 hours ago at 09:31 pm As others have pointed out: the upgrade to iOS 7 was free. If Apple forced me to upgrade... who cares? The only people with a legitimate grievance might be the guys with EOL devices that couldn't be upgraded to iOS 7. I do care if Apple forces me to update my device and the new software makes my device far worse off, which is precisely what iOS 7.0 did. For the entire half of a year before 7.1 came out, iOS 7.0 was abysmally slow and buggy. 7.1 improved things but nowhere near to where 6 was. I don't expect Apple to support the older OS much, but having completely irreversible updates can really burn people. I did manage to get iOS 6 back on my 4S and the thing runs every bit as well as my iPhone 6 on iOS 9/10, and is even faster at navigating the OS. I maintain that the iPhone 5 on iOS 6 is the fastest iPhone experience to date.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Justin Long is now starring in Huawei ads after Mac “stint” By Ida Torres - February 2, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter He may have been known as the star in the “I’m a Mac” ads for Apple back in 2009, but now it looks like Hollywood actor Justin Long has moved on, and to a rival company at that. Huawei released the first in what seems to be like a series of ads for its new flagship, the Mate 9, and it stars the actor, who’s also famous for other things like Jeepers Creepers, Life Free or Die Hard. But now, he’s “applying” for a job with the smartphone and banking on his previous connection without actually saying the word Mac or Apple. The first ad in the campaign is a 60-seconder entitled “The Interview”. It shows Long applying for a job as a director for the brand’s new commercial. The catch is that the interviewer is actually the Huawei Mate 9 itself and it only answers through images and emojis. He enumerates his qualifications in order to be chosen as the director for the ad. “I have a ton of experience in tech,” he states, which may be the closest thing he did to mention his previous Apple involvement. WPP’s Blast Radius, who is the creative agency behind the campaign, admits that Long’s previous association with the I’m a Mac ads was one of the reasons why they chose him to be the face of the ads. Huawei has actually not made it a secret that they want to compete directly with Apple, at least in the smartphone segment. They’re one of those Chinese brands that has started making headway in the US where Apple is still king (for now). Let’s see if having Justin Long as the face of the Huawei campaign will make any impact on the business side of things. Four more videos will be released on the company’s social channels throughout the fall.

Apple’s representatives led by Ms. Priya Balasubramaniam, VP iPhone operations, Mr. Ali Khanafer (Head, Government Affairs), Mr.Dheeraj Chugh (Director, iphone operations) and Mr. Priyesh Povanna (Country Counsel) met with Ministers and officials of Government of Karnataka and had positive discussions about the initiatives in manufacturing and possible collaborations with state Government in other areas. A source familiar with the matter told Reuters, however, that no deal, or memorandum of understanding had so far been finalised with the Karnataka government. The person, who asked not to be named, said if Apple did go ahead with plans to begin assembling the iPhone, it was likely to do so initially at a plant being set up by its Taiwanese manufacturing partner Wistron Corp at Peenya on the outskirts of the tech hub of Bengaluru, Karnataka. Apple was not immediately reachable for comment. Cupertino, California-based Apple, is keen to assemble its phones in India, one of the world’s fastest growing smartphone markets. Apple representatives met with federal and state government officials in India last week, as it is lobbying hard for a raft of tax and sourcing concessions from India, before it begins to assemble iPhones in the country.

Apple executives made a detailed presentation on its road map for setting up a manufacturing unit in India to an inter-ministerial group headed by Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion Secretary Ramesh Abhishek, officials privy to the development said. The presentation was made by senior executives of the company, Priya Balasubramanian. It cited the country’s business friendly ecosystem for keenness to start local manufacturing. With sales tapering in the US and China, Apple is eyeing India—the fastest growing smartphone market in the world—and looking to set up a local manufacturing unit to cut costs. It, however, does not manufacture devices on its own and rather does it through contract manufacturers.

Apple on Thursday held discussions with state ministers and officials, expressing its intention to set up a manufacturing facility in the city. “Apple’s representatives had positive discussions about the initiatives in manufacturing and possible collaborations with the state government in other areas,” Minister for Information Technology Priyank Kharge told DH. The minister said, “This will foster a cutting-edge technology ecosystem and supply chain development in Karnataka, which are critical for India to compete globally.” “Apple’s decision on initial manufacturing in Bengaluru has further enhanced the reputation of Bengaluru as the most preferred destination for foreign investment and further validation of the state government policies aimed at fostering manufacturing, innovation and investments in Karnataka,” he added. According to official sources, Apple is outsourcing its manufacturing of iconic iPhones in Bengaluru to Wistron, a Taiwanese OEM maker. “The government is committed to new initiatives in any sector for manufacturing and will provide a conducive environment for investment,” Kharge added. In May last year, Apple announced a new initiative to support engineering talent and accelerate growth in India’s iOS developer community by establishing an iOS app design and development accelerator in the city. The facility will provide support and guidance on Swift, Apple’s powerful and intuitive programming language created to build apps for iOS, Mac, Apple TV and Apple watch. Swift enables developers to write safer, more reliable code, save time and create richer app experiences. During his India visit in May last year, Apple CEO Tim Cook said, “With the opening of this new facility in Bengaluru, we’re giving developers access to tools which will help them create innovative apps for customers around the world.”   Tweet Go to Top Videos DH Recipe: Garlic payasam Madras soup to tempt your taste buds R-Day flower show draws big crowds The Car Doc: He brings vintage cars back to life Deccan Herald Spotlight - A conversation with Steve Coll, Nitin Pai and B S Arun Womens group out to reclaim nights World Puppets Mela Comes to Bengaluru World puppetry mela in Bengaluru Bengaluru rings in New Year in style Videos Nobel Peace Prize winners criticize Trump's migratory...

The government of Karnataka said on Thursday it welcomed a proposal from Apple Inc to begin initial manufacturing operations in the state, in a sign the tech company is slowly moving forward with plans to assemble iPhones in the country. “Apple’s intentions to manufacture in Bengaluru will foster cutting edge technology eco system and supply chain development in the state, which are critical for India to compete globally,” the Karnataka government said in a statement. A source familiar with the matter told Reuters, however, that no deal, or memorandum of understanding had so far been finalised with the Karnataka government. Read: Apple says ready to make in India, govt considers relaxing norms Apple has been asking for sops from the Indian government to start making iPhones in the country and as well as its own retail chain. HT had earlier reported that the inter-ministerial panel, which has been constituted specifically to look into the company’s claims for sops, saw Apple make its presentation in the last week of January and has is yet to take a decision on the matter. However, Union finance minister Arun Jaitley in his budget speech announced a record figure of Rs 745 crore under modified special incentive package scheme (MSIPS) to boost electronic manufacturing. In a caveat, the government also has proposed a 2% special additional duty on import of PCBs. PCBs or in simple words printed circuit boards makes up for 20-30% of a smartphone’s cost and is generally imported as India still doesn’t have fabrication units to manufacture them domestically. The person, who asked not to be named, said if Apple did go ahead with plans to begin assembling the iPhone, it was likely to do so initially at a plant being set up by its Taiwanese manufacturing partner Wistron Corp at Peenya on the outskirts of the tech hub of Bengaluru, Karnataka. Read: No sweetener for Apple to be a part of Make-in-India Apple was not immediately available for comment. Cupertino, California-based Apple, is keen to assemble its phones in India, one of the world’s fastest growing smartphone markets. Apple representatives met with central and state government officials in India last week, as it is lobbying hard for a raft of tax and sourcing concessions, before it begins to assemble iPhones in the country. Following the meetings, Apple said it appreciated the open and constructive dialogue it held with Indian officials, around the expansion of its local operations in the country. Read: Will iPhones get cheaper in India? Govt reserves decision for now Any final decision around manufacturing in India however, is likely to still be contingent on the government’s willingness to concede ground on the concessions sought by the company. Last month, information technology minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said India would consider Apple’s request for incentives to invest in the country with an “open mind.” On its part, the government of Karnataka said on Thursday it was “committed to new initiatives in any sector for manufacturing and will provide a conducive environment for investment.” (with Reuters inputs) tags Apple Apple India Apple iPhones iPhone iPhone 7 more from tech Facebook launches tools to encourage voting in India Feb 03, 2017 10:59 IST Oppo A57, selfie smartphone, priced at Rs 14,990 to go on sale today Feb 03, 2017 09:53 IST 10 Financial Mistakes to Avoid Promotional feature Recommended for you India World Business Education Autos Real estate Opinion Analysis Columns Editorials Blogs Authors Cities Delhi Gurgaon Noida Mumbai Bhopal Chandigarh Dehradun Indore Jaipur Kolkata Lucknow Patna Ranchi Sports Cricket Football Tennis Others Entertainment Movie reviews Bollywood Hollywood Regional movies World cinema TV Music Tabloid Lifestyle Sex & relationship Health & fitness Fashion & trends Art & culture Travel Books Brunch Tech Tech Reviews Gadgets Photos Videos Epaper HT Indepth Punjab Livemint Livehindustan Shine HTcampus Desimartini HTsyndication Follow us on: Newsletter Register with Hindustan Times to get best news and articles Copyright © HT Media Limited All rights reserved.

The wireless earbuds were originally announced alongside the iPhone 7 last September and given a release date of sometime in the fall. Following the release of AirPods, however, BeatsX were delayed until February. As that launch nears, however, iStockNow reports that BeatsX could launch as soon as sometime this week… The site, which made a name for itself by tracking inventory of hard-to-find Apple products, wrote in a blog post that Apple’s online store is “all ready” for the official launch of BeatsX. Additionally, it is said that there has been activity on BestBuy’s U.S. website regarding BeatsX stock. iStockNow closely tracks inventory and availability changes for Apple products, thus meaning it has systems in place to see any sort of changes in the back-end of Apple and retailers like BestBuy. It’s hard to know when exactly BeatsX are going to launch, but given the activity iStockNow is seeing on Apple’s and BestBuy’s websites and the previously announced February release date, it seems likely that the launch will occur at any moment. BeatsX differ from AirPods in that they use a wire between each bud, as well as an in-ear design similar to that of the company’s UrBeats wired headphones. Like the Powerbeats3 and Solo3 headphones, the BeatsX use Apple’s W1 chip for smoother connectivity. What sets BeatsX apart, however, is the use of Lightning for charging as opposed to microUSB like other Beats products. Other features of BeatsX include Fast Fuel, which gives the earbuds 2 hours of playback in 5 minutes of charging, as well as magnetic earbuds for keeping them tangle-free. When released, BeatsX will be priced at $149, putting them below both Apple’s AirPods and Powerbeats 3. Additionally, that price point makes them the cheapest W1 option on the market. Whenever BeatsX do launch to the public, we’ll be sure to let you know immediately. We’re also planning hands-on comparisons between AirPods, Powerbeats 3, and BeatsX.

Apple Inc which has been negotiating with the government for greater concessions to set up a manufacturing unit in the country, has decided to go with Bengaluru for its first plant. According to a PTI report, Apple's representatives, including Vice President iPhone operations Priya Balasubramaniam, Government Affairs Head Ali Khanafer, Director iPhone operations Dheeraj Chugh, and Country Counsel Priyesh Povanna met with the ministers and officials of the Karnataka government. The report said the two parties had "positive discussions about the initiatives in manufacturing and possible collaborations with the state government in other areas." Karnataka IT Minister Priyank Kharge said, "Apple's intentions to manufacture in Bengaluru will foster cutting edge technology ecosystem and supply chain development in the state, which are critical for India to compete globally. Tiaiwanese OEM maker for Apple, Wistron, may manufacture iPhones in India. India-made iPhones will let Apple price the phones more competitively, making them affordable for more Indians.

The Cupertino-based company posted an all-time record quarterly revenue of 78.4 billion U.S. dollars in the period running from October to December, a three percent increase from the same quarter last year. Apple made 17.9 billion U.S. dollars in profit, compared to 18.4 billion U.S. dollars in the first quarter of 2016. "We're thrilled to report that our holiday quarter results generated Apple's highest quarterly revenue ever, and broke multiple records along the way. We sold more iPhones than ever before and set all-time revenue records for iPhone, Services, Mac and Apple Watch," CEO Tim Cook said. A total of 78.29 million iPhones were sold during the period, up from 74.78 million the year before. The U.S. firm beat South Korea's giant Samsung Electronics' 77.5 million smartphone sales in Q1 of 2017 – the first time since the fourth quarter of 2011 – according to tech data firm Strategy Analytics. While Europe and the Asia-Pacific region witnessed discernible growth and the Americas and Japan saw significant growth, Greater China faced contraction. The market, which was once the growth engine of the company, seems to be turning into its Achilles' heel as Apple comes under mounting pressure from homegrown brands. The revenue in Greater China, which includes the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Macao, stood at 16.2 billion U.S. dollars in the quarter, down 12 percent. It marked the fourth straight fall in quarterly revenue in the market. Cook conceded that there were challenges in China during a call with investors. Chinese smartphone manufacturers Oppo and Huawei are eating through Apple's market share in the region, according to data from Kantar Worldpanel. Last year, Apple was toppled by Oppo with the iPhone losing its spot as the most selling smartphone in China – the first time in five years – to Oppo R9. iPhone 6s had a market share of two percent in comparison with Oppo R9's four percent, a report published last week by Hong Kong-based Counterpoint Research has shown. "Chinese consumers have shown a greater affinity to buy premium phones from local players," Tarun Pathak, analyst at Counterpoint, has said. Apple's services, which include the App Store, Apple Pay and iCloud, increased 18 percent to 7.17 billion U.S. dollars. "Revenue from Services grew strongly over last year, led by record customer activity on the App Store. We are very excited about the products in our pipeline," Cook noted. Apple's satisfactory report comes after a tough year for the tech giant, as the company encountered a decline in annual sales and profits last October – its first in 15 years. The success of Apple relies heavily on the iPhone sales, which account for two-thirds of the company's total revenue. Apple predicts its revenue in the second quarter of 2017 to range between 51.5 and 53.5 billion U.S. dollars. In Q2 of 2016, the company recorded 50.6 billion U.S. dollars in revenue.

(AAPL), BlackBerry Ltd (BBRY) and Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL) Apple reacted in controversial manner to a presidential executive order Jan 30, 2017, 9:02 am EST  |  By Karl Utermohlen, InvestorPlace Writer     View All   There have been promises of Donald Trump’s presidency improving the U.S. economy, but a report from Source ETF — one of the leading exchange-traded fund product providers in Europe — believes stocks are “unlikely to perform better” during the four-year tenure. It was a busy weekend, with companies such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), BlackBerry Ltd (NASDAQ:BBRY) and Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL) making headlines. Here’s what went down ahead of Monday’s trading action: Apple Inc. (AAPL) Apple is in the midst of a controversial move that will limit the number of apps available to consumers in Iran. The company has reportedly been pulling Iranian apps from the App Store. The App Store was first opened in the Middle Eastern country a few months ago in September 2016. At first, there were numerous restrictions governing the Store, but Apple was slowly removing these. However, a credible tech news site called Techrasa said an popular Iranian e-commerce service Digikala had its app removed from the App Store. The app had more than a million users. One fact worth noting is that there is no official App Store for the territory of Iran, but many companies manage to sell their apps to consumers in Iran by registering their app as being outside the country. The country has about 40 million smartphones in use, which amounts to roughly half of the 82 million population using devices. AAPL shares have risen 5.3% year-to-date. BlackBerry Ltd (BBRY) BlackBerry is looking for one last hurrah in the smartphone industry with its Mercury device. The company has managed to survive going under by slowly transitioning from a hardware maker to a software provider. While the Mercury isn’t even technically manufactured by BlackBerry, the company still had a hand in the creation of device. The gadget recently made an appearance in Last Man Standing, an ABC sitcom starring Tim Allen. The actor’s character — Michael Baxter — is seen rocking the Mercury ahead of the product’s release. In fact, Baxter is seen using the phone several times and there are some close-ups that give the audience some idea of what it looks like when in use. BlackBerry’s latest smartphone will be unveiled at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona next month. Allen is a fan of the company’s phones, but it is unclear if the decision to use it on the show was his idea or a decision made by one of the producers. BBRY shares have slipped 5.4% over the past six months.

Sarah Tew/CNET Mobile by Shara Tibken January 30, 2017 5:00 AM PST @sharatibken Up Next Tech companies newest cause celebre? Boycott Breitbart Two years ago, analysts couldn't find enough glowing adjectives to describe Apple's fiscal first-quarter results. "Stunning," "outstanding" and a "monster" were among their reactions to Apple's blowout quarter. Another simply said, "Wow!" The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, Apple's first big-screen phones, drove the company to top Wall Street's highest expectations. Apple sold more iPhones than it ever had before -- 74.5 million devices in 90 days -- which led the company to beat the world record for quarterly profits. Fast forward to 2017. It's unlikely we'll hear the same sort of enthusiasm when Apple reports results Tuesday for its first quarter, which ended in late December. That's because the iPhone 7 doesn't wow quite as much as its older sibling. Master the bokeh effect on the iPhone 7 Plus The dual-lens camera on Apple's iPhone 7 Plus is finally showing off its full potential with the update to iOS 10.1. We'll show you what the new portrait mode looks like and how to use it. by Vanessa Hand Orellana 2:09 Close Drag The iPhone is more important to Apple than ever before, with the company generating about two-thirds of sales from the device. A lot of revenue not directly from the iPhone, like services, is also tied to the phone. But Apple, like other handset makers, is facing waning excitement over phones, something that led its iPhone sales to drop for the first time ever in 2016. Analysts expect Apple to say it sold more iPhones in its first quarter than a year ago (78 million versus 74.8 million last year, according to UBS), breaking its three-quarter streak of declines. But they're not expecting anything near the blowout in fiscal 2015. Apple didn't have a comment ahead of its earnings report. See also CNET's take on the iPhone 7 Plus Qualcomm CEO fires back at Apple: Bring it on The smartphone party is over The newest iPhones, the 7 and the 7 Plus, added features like better cameras and water resistance that have pleased many buyers. But the designs look a lot like the 2-year-old iPhone 6 and 6 Plus and the year-old 6S and 6S Plus. That's led many people to opt for older phones instead of buying Apple's latest and greatest, says Barclays analyst Mark Moskowitz. On top of that, people aren't clamoring to upgrade their phones as often, he said. "Smartphones in general have evolved technologically to become more than good enough to serve most users' digital needs over multiple years or until the device breaks," Moskowitz noted. Apple's not the only one seeing this shift. The entire smartphone market slowed over the past few quarters as consumers cope with "phone fatigue." Global phone shipments flatlined in 2016, according to market tracker IDC. The estimated 0.6 percent rise to 1.45 billion units is much less than the 10.4 percent growth rate the industry saw between 2014 and 2015. The holiday-shopping season is typically Apple's biggest quarter, thanks to gift givers and the fact that it's the first full quarter of sales from the newest iPhone. 5 How the original iPhone stacks up to the iPhone 7 Plus Overall, analysts expect Apple to report earnings of $3.22 a share, down from $3.28 a year earlier, according to Yahoo Finance. Revenue should climb 2 percent year over year to $77.4 billion. (In October, Apple projected sales of $76 billion to $78 billion, above analysts' estimates at the time.) The current quarter, which ends in late March, isn't expected to be a blowout either. Some analysts say Apple could forecast weaker revenue than Wall Street anticipates. (Currently analysts expect Apple's fiscal second-quarter revenue to total $54 billion, up 6.9 percent from a year ago.) Along with weaker phone demand, some people could be holding out for what could be huge changes in the iPhone 8, which, if Apple follows its schedule from recent years, will be released in September. That phone marks the 10th anniversary of the first iPhone and the guess is that Apple will make big design tweaks, like adding an OLED screen to the device for the first time that makes blacker blacks. It may even shrink the bezel around the display -- or eliminate it all together -- to make the touchscreen bigger. Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty said the iPhone 8 could drive a "supercycle" of sales, with iPhone shipments expected to rise at least 20 percent in 2018. But for now, Apple's got to get past what could be a boring fiscal 2017. Does the Mac still matter? Apple execs tell why the MacBook Pro was over four years in the making, and why we should care.

But what if one is camping and has no access to electrical power? Or otherwise unable to charge the Apple Watch as expected. Wouldn’t it be nice to have an interchangeable Apple Watch band that could provide backup power? A good collection of bands means one could wear the AW all the time, says our Bryan Chaffin, and that means opportunity for sleep tracking, says our Jeff Gamet.

According to Re/code, the tech giants are reaching out to other tech companies, including Uber and Stripe, as well as companies outside of the tech space. BREAKING: Big tech giants like Google, Apple, Microsoft and Facebook along with CPG, manufacturing cos working on letter opposing Trump ban — Kara Swisher (@karaswisher) February 2, 2017 Tone and Approach Re/code published a draft of a letter the companies plan to send the White House. That draft directly makes the case that America was built on immigration. It indirectly makes the case that the rule of law and predictability is important to business. It also strikes a markedly conciliatory tone, making much of changes to the initial executive order forced by courts. The companies also make repeated offers to work with the White House to find better ways of achieving the stated goals of the Trump administration. Social media reaction to the news has been mixed. Many have praised the companies for taking a stand, while others have criticized the letter as inadequate. @karaswisher @mumper A letter you say? I sure hope it’s a sharply worded correspondence. — Rod Von Hugendong (@Oxpocket) February 2, 2017 Supporters of Donald Trump have, naturally, criticized and attacked the companies (and Re/code) in any number of ways. Corporate Action Executives at all the above-listed companies have criticized the executive order. Apple CEO Tim Cook told The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday that his company was weighing its legal options. It’s possible—perhaps even likely—that this letter is the first public-facing action of a coalition. The tech giants want business response to be broad and comprehensive. It’s one thing for the White House to dismiss Silicon Valley response as a product of an irrelevant Left Coast. It’s another for companies from all over America to be part of the message. But…the tech world is leading this for a reason. Being left of center isn’t a big risk in Silicon Valley, but there are obviously many parts of the country where it is, regardless of the business case to be made against the executive order. With that in mind, getting companies to sign off on a mealy-mouthed letter is a far easier first step than getting them to sign on to, say, a lawsuit. Text of the Draft, from Re/Code Dear President Trump, Since the country’s birth, America has been the land of opportunity — welcoming newcomers and giving them the chance to build families, careers and businesses in the United States. We are a nation made stronger by immigrants. As entrepreneurs and business leaders, our ability to grow our companies and create jobs depends on the contributions of immigrants from all backgrounds. We share your goal of ensuring that our immigration system meets today’s security needs and keeps our country safe. We are concerned, however, that your recent executive order will affect many visa holders who work hard here in the United States and contribute to our country’s success. In a global economy, it is critical that we continue to attract the best and brightest from around the world. We welcome the changes your administration has made in recent days in how the Department of Homeland Security will implement the executive order, and we stand ready to help your administration identify other opportunities to ensure that our employees can travel with predictability and without undue delay. Our nation’s compassion is a part of what makes it exceptional, and we are committed to helping your administration identify approaches for thorough screening without a blanket suspension of admissions under the U.S. Refugee Admissions program. While security and vetting procedures can and should always be subject to continuous evaluation and improvement, a blanket suspension is not the right approach. Similarly, we stand ready to identify ways of helping to achieve your stated goal of bringing clarity to the future of the 750,000 Dreamers in this country under the protections of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program in a way “that will make people happy and proud.” Removing these protections by barring renewals would effectively end the program and eliminate the ability for these Dreamers to work and live without the fear of deportation. The business community shares your commitment to growing the American economy and expanding job creation across the country. We hire both thousands of Americans and some of the most talented people from abroad, who work together to help our companies succeed and expand our overall employment. As you contemplate changes to the nation’s complex and interconnected immigration policies, whether business and employment-based visas, refugees or DACA, we hope that you will use us as a resource to help achieve immigration policies that both support the work of American businesses and reflect American values.

Don’t let the politicians play us. – Kuwait currently bans immigration from 5 muslim countries. – In 2011, Obama banned immigration from Iraq for 6 months. – Here’s a Muslim personally confirming no Muslim ban in the USA at this time. February 2, 2017 at 8:28 EST PM DudeMac February 2, 2017 No need to spread fake news. There is no Muslim ban! February 2, 2017 at 9:22 EST PM JustCause February 3, 2017 Yep no Muslim ban, companies are just preparing lawsuits, courts are filing injunctions and lawyers are camping out at airports to release people from something that doesn’t exist. We will see blood shed in the US before this gets better. February 3, 2017 at 12:50 EST AM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

Meet Alo, A Phone Concept From The Future Just in Cases: iPhone Protection 2017 View All Editorials → Apple Working on Custom Mac Chips to Cut Reliance on Intel Jeff Gamet @jgamet · +Jeff Gamet Feb 2nd, 2017 6:28 PM EST | News Apple is reportedly working to scale back its reliance on Intel for MacBook and MacBook Pro chips by designing its own ARM-based processor. The Apple-designed chip will handle low power functions such as Power Nap, and could be a step towards abandoning Intel at some point in the future. Apple wants to put more of its own chips in the Mac Apple has been working on the new chip code named T310 since last year, according to insider sources speaking with Bloomberg. Those sources said the T310 chip will supplement Intel’s chips, but won’t replace them. The T310 will handle tasks like Power Nap mode which lets Macs check for and install updates, sync calendars, and check email when they otherwise appear to be in sleep mode. Apple’s Custom Processors This isn’t Apple’s first foray into custom chip design. The company has used its own custom ARM-based processors in the iPhone and iPad for years, and Apple Watch runs on an Apple-designed processor, too. Apple is already using a custom processor for the MacBook Pro’s Touch Bar called T1, as well, so using more in-house designed chips for system tasks isn’t a stretch. Apple CEO Tim Cook and Steve Jobs before him have pushed for less reliance on third party companies for key device components, and designing task-specific chips is part of that philosophy. It’s also another step down the path towards completely custom processors for Apple’s computers. The company has years of experience with running devices on its own processors thanks to the iPhone and iPad. That’s useful information as the company pushes forward with its custom Mac chips. Apple Chips Versus Developers Creating the T1 and T310 aren’t, however, signs that Apple is ready to abandon Intel’s processors. Intel’s chips handle more intensive operations and that isn’t likely to change any time soon. Convincing big name developers, like Adobe and Microsoft, to rewrite their products for a whole new processor platform could be a problem, too. They slowly transitioned away from PowerPC processors to Intel when Apple made that change, but convincing them to do it again may not be so easy. For now, Apple can leave power and processor-intensive tasks to Intel’s chips and tasks that can benefit from the power saving features of custom designed T-series chips can help extend battery life and work more efficiently with software. That’ll help make Apple’s computers more efficient, but it won’t overcome Intel’s processor refresh cycle which doesn’t seem to be in line with its own computer upgrade schedule. The MacBook Pro, for example, stagnated for years waiting fort significantly improved processors and in the end Apple released the Touch Bar MacBook Pro with the Skylake chipset even though the newer Kaby Lake chipset was in production. For Apple, waiting any longer to refresh the MacBook Pro wasn’t an option. The company chose to use the year-old Skylake technology in the new models because Kaby Lake chipsets weren’t shipping in the quantities it needed. Rumors claim Apple plans to release a Kaby Lake-based version of the MacBook Pro in the coming months, which will overcome power and RAM limitations that come along with Skylake. Apple can’t walk away from Intel’s laptop and desktop chipsets, but it can supplement them with its own designes to improve performance and battery life. It looks like that’s Apple’s plan for now, but Intel is no doubt watching closely to see if future Macs can run on chips it doesn’t make.

Like this story, share it with millions of investors on M3 Apple moves closer to iPhone assembly in India "Apple's intentions to manufacture in Bengaluru will foster cutting edge technology eco system and supply chain development in the state, which are critical for India to compete globally," the government of the south Indian state said in a statement. Post Your Comments Share Cancel The government of the Indian state of Karnataka said on Thursday it welcomed a proposal from Apple Inc to begin initial manufacturing operations in the state, in a sign the tech company is slowly moving forward with plans to assemble iPhones in the country. "Apple's intentions to manufacture in Bengaluru will foster cutting edge technology eco system and supply chain development in the state, which are critical for India to compete globally," the government of the south Indian state said in a statement. A source familiar with the matter told Reuters, however, that no deal, or memorandum of understanding had so far been finalised with the Karnataka government. The person, who asked not to be named, said if Apple did go ahead with plans to begin assembling the iPhone, it was likely to do so initially at a plant being set up by its Taiwanese manufacturing partner Wistron Corp at Peenya on the outskirts of the tech hub of Bengaluru, Karnataka. Apple was not immediately reachable for comment. Cupertino, California-based Apple, is keen to assemble its phones in India, one of the world's fastest growing smartphone markets. Apple representatives met with federal and state government officials in India last week, as it is lobbying hard for a raft of tax and sourcing concessions from India, before it begins to assemble iPhones in the country. Following the meetings, Apple said it appreciated the open and constructive dialogue it held with Indian officials, around the expansion of its local operations in the country. Any final decision around manufacturing in India however, is likely to still be contingent on the government's willingness to concede ground on the concessions sought by the company. Last month, Information Technology Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said India would consider Apple's request for incentives to invest in the country with an "open mind." On its part, the government of Karnataka said on Thursday it was "committed to new initiatives in any sector for manufacturing and will provide a conducive environment for investment." Karnataka IT Minister Priyank Kharge told CNBC-TV18 that the government was in direct talks and said he was hopeful the rollout should start in three-four months.

The Commission ordered Apple to pay Ireland the unpaid taxes after ruling in August that the iPhone maker won sweetheart tax deals from Dublin amounting to illegal state aid. The Irish government and Apple have appealed the demand. The Commission said it expected that the amount owed would total 13 billion euros plus interest but required Ireland to calculate the exact sums based on the methodology designed and set out in the ruling. "So far my officials haven't indicated to me that it's going to seriously overrun the 13 (billion euros) or come seriously short of the 13, but there are other years to be assessed and so on," Finance Minister Michael Noonan told a parliamentary committee, referring to the 10-year period the calculations are based on. Noonan said Irish officials were still negotiating the terms of a ring-fenced escrow fund where the back taxes will be held pending the outcome of the appeals process, which the Irish government has said could take four or five years. Ireland requested an extension to complete the collection of the funds after a formal deadline for doing so elapsed last month. The EU's antitrust regulator said on Tuesday that the Commission was satisfied with Ireland's progress to date.

SiliconValley.com Twitter Facebook Google+ RSS   Social Web Mobile Cloud Gadgets Cleantech VC Data Games Policy Media   Apple hit with class-action lawsuit for allegedly ‘breaking’ FaceTime video-calling on iPhones to save money By Ethan Baron / February 2, 2017 at 5:19 PM Apple deliberately disabled the FaceTime video-calling feature for millions of users in order to save money, a lawsuit filed Feb. 2 by a Marin County woman claimed. “Internal Apple emails eliminate any doubt that Apple intentionally broke FaceTime,” said the lawsuit by Christina Grace, who is seeking class-action status. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The class of plaintiffs is intended to be anyone who, like Grace, had an iPhone 4 or 4S running operating system iOS 6 or earlier on April 16, 2014 — the date Apple allegedly sabotaged FaceTime out of mercenary motives. According to the lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in San Jose, Apple was running up big “relay usage” bills for FaceTime-related server services from Akamai Technologies. “Apple began to incur multi-million-dollar monthly charges for its use of Akamai’s servers,” the suit said. “Therefore, as internal Apple emails reveal, Apple undertook a concerted effort to find a way to reduce its relay usage by reducing the volume of FaceTime calls connected through the relay method.” But then came a new Apple operating system, iOS 7, which allowed the company to process the calls without need for a relay service, the suit said. However, millions of users’ devices still used iOS 6 or earlier systems, and couldn’t use FaceTime without the relay service, so Apple faced continuing heavy payments to Akamai, according to the lawsuit. “Consequently, to further reduce its relay usage costs, Apple devised a scheme to force millions of its users — i.e., users running iOS version 6 and earlier — to stop using FaceTime on their devices,” the suit said. “Its engineers caused a digital certificate necessary to the operation of FaceTime on iOS 6 or an earlier operating system to prematurely expire. Upon the expiration of that certificate, and as a direct result of Apple’s actions, the valuable FaceTime feature immediately and abruptly stopped working for millions of users running iOS 6 or an earlier operating system. “In a disturbing juxtaposition to Apple’s marketing campaigns that highlighted the life-changing importance of FaceTime to separated families, deployed soldiers, hearing-impaired individuals and countless others, Apple advanced its financial interests by intentionally breaking FaceTime for millions of its users.” Users were left to choose whether to give up FaceTime, update to iOS7 or buy a new iPhone with that operating system on it, the suit said. The updating option did not leave users of early-model iPhones well served, according to the suit. “For iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S users, for example, the coerced move to iOS 7 subjected their devices to slowness, system crashes, erratic behavior and/or the elimination of their ability to use critical functions on their phone.” The alleged breaking of FaceTime caused a great hue and cry among the public and media, the suit said. But rather than copping to purported shenanigans, Apple instead blamed a bug and said users should update to iOS7, the suit said. Internal emails reveal the truth, the suit claimed. “Apple engineering manager Patrick Gates sent the following email to various Apple personnel: ‘Hey, guys. I’m looking at the Akamai contract for next year. I understand we did something in April around iOS 6 to reduce relay utilization.’ “Apple engineer Gokul Thirumalai responded to Gates, stating the following: ‘It was a big user of relay bandwidth. We broke iOS 6, and the only way to get FaceTime working again is to upgrade to iOS 7.'” The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, and payment to Grace and the class of “financial benefit received and unjustly retained by Defendant Apple.”   Photo: The Apple logo (AFP PHOTO /GABRIELLE LURIE/Getty Images)   Share this: Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Reddit Google More Pinterest Tumblr   Tags: Apple, FaceTime, iOS7, iphone 4, iPhone 4S, lawsuit   More Posts in 1 Google eyes office drones for virtual ‘telepresence’ meetings February 2, 2017   Uber faces more protests Thursday over CEO’s Trump ties February 2, 2017   Google co-founder Sergey Brin at SFO protest: ‘I am a refugee’ January 30, 2017       Share this Post Tweet       Roxy Balboa Sounds like a stretch.

Jabra's Elite Sport are wireless in-ear headphones that compete with Apple's AirPods for size and portability, but they also track your workouts and heart rate and give you an idea of how your fitness is evolving. What Is It? The $329 Elite Sport are Jabra's top headphones. You're paying a lot because you're paying for how small they are, and you're paying for the fact that they're more than just headphones: the Elite Sport includes a built-in heart rate monitor that uses the blood vessels in your ear to track your heart rate, and an accompanying app that logs all that data and translates it into information about your body's VO2 max and other statistics. Each Elite Sport earphone is smaller than you'd think; the headphones protrude only slightly from the wearer's ear, and there's no overhang or extension beyond that. The right earbud has play/pause and track skipping buttons, while the right has a volume control. Pressing each tactile button, though, takes a little bit more force than you'd expect — sometimes it's actually slightly uncomfortable inside your ear to skip ahead or pause a track. You can choose from three different silicon eartips or hard-sealing foam eartips, and three 'earwings': a silicon cover that sits up inside the conch of your ear cartilage and holds the Elite Sport securely in place. The headphones are themselves rated IP67 for dust- and waterproofing, so they'll stand up to your sweaty runs or an exercise in the rain. It's good to have the peace of mind that it's possible to throw them into the pocket of your gym shorts when you're done with your workout, too, and not kill them by accident — something I've been mindful of with the AirPods I took on a couple of gym trips in the past. You can wear a single Jabra earbud or both; unlike Apple's AirPods, if you're listening to a single bud you'll only get that stereo channel piped to your ears rather than a downmixed stereo. When you're done with your listening session, which can extend to around three hours maximum battery life, the headphones live inside a charging case (which uses two pogo-pin connectors on each earbud) that contains another 6 hours worth of charge overall. What's It Good At? For completely wireless and in-ear Bluetooth headphones, Jabra's Elite Sport actually sound pretty good. Because they seal well against the wearer's ear canal, there's a lot of bass that you don't hear with other wireless earbuds like Apple's open-to-the-world AirPods. And it's this combo of good ambient noise cancellation plus good sound quality that makes the Elite Sport my go-to headphones for the gym or for a long bike ride. There are better-sounding in-ear headphones and wireless over-the-ear headphones out there for lower prices, but for the combo of small + wireless + good sound, it's hard to find a better choice than the Elite Sport — although they come at a price. You can ask Jabra's app to guide you through workouts using voice prompts, whether it's through rep count or VO2 max monitoring or heart rate tracking. You can just tell the app to track your workout passively, if you're already a fan of another fitness app, so your headphones can give you another point of reference if you really want it. To be honest, I find tracking my workouts on my Apple Watch to be more satisfying — I can log my swimming, for one — but Jabra's app is a good backup or extra monitoring to give you another point of data to work with. Being waterproof gives you the freedom to use Jabra's Elite Sport headphones pretty much everywhere. I wouldn't want to use them in the pool during a swim, but it's definitely possible. Taking them out for a run in the rain, or god forbid if you want to wear them in the shower — both of these are perfectly fine. If you register your headphones, you also get access to a three-year replacement warranty against any damage from sweat — which shouldn't be necessary, but it's nice to have a bit of extra peace of mind as a backup. What's It Not Good At? There's one big problem with the Elite Sport that only crops up if you want to wear a single earbud. If you do, you have to wear the right earbud — it's the master ear, and it's the only one that actually communicates with the phone. The left earbud only talks to the right, too — it'll only work if the right is within around 30 centimetres distance, meaning you can't keep the right in your pocket while you're training. This is actually really annoying in some circumstances, and it baffled me the first time I tried it at the gym. Similarly, the training advice through the headphones doesn't pause or duck the volume of whatever music you're listening to. If it's at all possible, I'd really recommend you try and find somewhere that you can try the Elite Sport before you slap down $329 for them. The earwing plus eartip setup can be uncomfortable for some wearers, and it's also quite hard to get right: it took me experimenting with six different combos of small/medium earwings and small/medium silicon and foam eartips to find the most comfortable setup. When I did find it, it was heavenly bliss, but it took some time and effort and everyone's ear canals have a different shape. Battery life, too, is mediocre. Three hours' usage from the Elite Sport earbuds — I tested it, and it's bang on the money — should be just enough for a long workout at the gym, but it might not be long enough for that long-distance bike trip you're planning. You'll get another two full recharges from the charging carry case, but it's not a fast-charging case like Apple's is: you can't pop your earbuds back in there for five minutes to get another hour out of them. It just requires a bit of forward planning to use your headphones, and that's fine, but it's planning you don't have to do with other competitors. Should You Buy It? If you want or need some truly wireless headphones, you don't have a great many choices in the first place. Of the various options available, Jabra's $329 Elite Sport are among the most expensive, but make up for that by being some of the best sounding and also by integrating some useful fitness features and waterproofing. If you can live with the comparatively short battery life, they're a good wireless earbud. Comments frankly_franky @frankly_franky Feb 3, 2017, 1:35pm Just waiting for these 'in ear' wireless earphones to become mainstream enough to be cheap. I bought a $20 pair of bluetooth earphones online, the sound is actually (surprisingly) really great, however the cord going between the 2 and the slightly bulky control makes it uncomfortable to wear while running. For daily commute however it's amazing. Reply 2 philip82c @philip82c Feb 3, 2017, 5:07pm I've had a pair of Jabra Sports Pulse (basically the previous version of these) for 3 years and I love them, but they're very inconsistent. Working out at the gym, the heart rate monitor constantly loses touch with heart rate, resulting in regular dips from ~150bpm to ~70bpm, then a slow build back up to the correct heart rate. It's a nightmare for V02 tests and the result always shows a fitness level less than it should be. I'd happily replace them with these if they're more reliable on heart rate reading (and less vulnerable to bluetooth interference). Do these seem pretty strong in that regard?

Tablet sales in the fourth quarter fell 20 per cent from a year earlier to 52.9 million units, according to the research firm IDC. A separate survey by Strategy Analytics said sales slumped nine per cent to 63.5 million. IDC analysts said overall 2016 sales fell 15.6 per cent to 178.4 million units, in a second consecutive annual decline following a period of sizzling growth. The analysts said many consumers are moving away from the “slate” tablets to more versatile devices with detachable keyboards, which may be categorized as either tablets or PCs. “The sentiment around the tablet market continues to grow stale despite a lot of talk about vendors pivoting their product portfolios toward the detachable segment,” IDC’s Ryan Reith said. “Typical tablets without a dedicated keyboard, which IDC refers to as slate tablets, are continuing to lose relevancy across all regions and, as a result, we see the decline happening globally.” Apple this week reported it sold 13.1 million of its iPads in the fourth quarter, a drop of nearly 19 per cent from a year ago, but enough to lead the category. According to IDC, Apple and the iPad held 24.7 per cent of the market, while Strategy Analytics estimated its market share at 20.6 per cent. Samsung was the number-two vendor with more than eight million tablets sold. IDC estimated Amazon sold 5.2 million of its Fire tablets to lift its market share to nearly 10 per cent. But Strategy Analytics figures show Amazon selling 4.2 million units for a 6.7 per cent share. Amazon does not disclose sales figures for its devices. Strategy Analytics said in its report that Amazon’s low-cost devices, which sell for as little as US$49 (RM215), have had some success “reaching a broad range of consumers looking for an entertainment tablet with key content tie-ins to the growing Amazon ecosystem.” The other manufacturers in the top five were China-based Lenovo and Huawei, according to the surveys. Sales of Windows-powered tablets grew 19 per cent from a year ago and accounted for 16 per cent of the market, according to Strategy Analytics. Strategy Analytics analyst Eric Smith said Microsoft, with its Surface family of devices, is the largest vendor in the Windows segment with about 15 per cent, but that its partners — including Lenovo, Asus, Dell, and HP — sell the majority of Windows tablets. — AFP                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Louis Pion honours competing World Cup 2014 nations with watches Nintendo Switch’s online fee could be half of PlayStation, Xbox plans Scientists develop wearable AI system that detects tone of conversations Nintendo plays with fire as new mobile game takes ‘gacha’ global Apple keeps lead in slumping tablet market In move to Facebook, Barra leaves unfinished expansion at Xiaomi Google, Facebook reflect tech dismay on Trump immigration order Battle of the digital butlers: Alexa takes on Siri (VIDEO) Apple joins group devoted to keeping AI nice 'Ace Combat 7' expands horizons on PC, Xbox One, PS4 (VIDEO) Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: Uber CEO quits Trump’s business advisory group ‘Smurfs: The Lost Village’ gets a new trailer See this new clip for ‘John Wick: Chapter 2’ Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: Fancy a gourmet meal underwater?

Credit: Apple More like this Apple’s iPhone: 10 years old and only getting started Is MacBook Pro the future of the Apple desktop? What to expect from Apple’s new Mac 'hello' Video Mingis on Tech: The MacBook Pro show-and-tell Apple is not an imitation. It plans its own future and while it takes inspiration from everywhere, it remains resolutely committed to adapting new ideas within its own unique expression. That’s what Steve Jobs meant when he said “Great artists steal”. Macs are moving to ARM A Bloomberg report suggests Apple plans to give more responsibility to ARM processors inside future Macs. The Apple Touch ID unit used inside the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar is already powered by its own ARM-based chip, which runs independent of the Intel processor. The report tells us Apple plans to put an ARM chip inside future Macs that will be responsible for handling “low-power tasks”, such as background app activity, Power Nap mode and so on. Better battery This should help improve Mac battery life, the report explains. It specifically suggests that Macs will be more able to retrieve e-mails, install software updates, and synchronize calendar appointments with the display shut and not in use. This is what Power Nap already does, though by default it only does so when your Mac is connected to a power supply. (You can override this in System Preferences, but you are likely to see an impact on battery life). The report claims Apple intends popping the new processor inside MacBook Pro models later this year. These are expected to use Intel’s Kaby Lake chips as their main processor. It has previously been suggested they will appear in Q2. Inevitability and gradualness I don’t think it’s all about power, even though better power management as a slogan seems to echo beyond the technology industry these days. I imagine it also means you’ll see another level of iOS-like performance on your Mac. Your apps will be on without lag, data will sync between Apple platforms, and you will also see the kind of tight storage management and retrieval you may have become used to on iOS devices. Chips with vroom We first began to hear speculation Apple may migrate the Mac to ARM back in 2011. That's when reports claimed Apple would need to develop 64-bit iOS chips in order to enable this transition. Apple’s A-series processors have been 64-bit since the iPhone 5s. They have been through multiple iterations since and the current model is the fastest mobile processor money can buy. It will be until Apple improves it again later this year in the new iPad Pro. The company has poured resources into processor development and the next iPad refresh in calendar Q2 will offer an A-series chip capable of PC-type performance. PCs will be trucks, but it takes time. What next? This isn’t about Intel. There is no doubt that the ability to run Windows on Macs has helped Apple build Mac market share since the Intel transition took place. Apple doesn’t need to sacrifice that advantage. Windows 10 already runs on ARM-based processors, and Intel has already reached a deal to make ARM-based chips. Apple can migrate without losing key partnerships – but it is not time… yet. Mobile technology is pervading every part of life. Connected everything means mobile processors will be everywhere, so it makes sense to ensure our PCs are deeply compatible with these things. Bloomberg’s warning that Apple is giving ARM chips more responsibilities within future Macs reflects a wider move, one in which the computer is everywhere and inside everything. Apple has no intention of being at any disadvantage on this emerging battlefield. It is equipped for the critical everything everywhere platform war, with the future of the world at stake. Google+?

The BBC1 four-parter, adapted from the Louise Doughty novel, stars Emily Watson as Dr Yvonne Carmichael, a married 52-year-old scientist whose life changes when she sleeps with a stranger. ‘I used to be a civilised woman,’ she says in the opening scenes, as she is driven towards court wearing a pair of handcuffs (and not in a Fifty Shades kind of way). Apple Tree Yard has already caused controversy and divided opinion. Partly because the brooding, claustrophobic atmosphere has alienated those looking for the usual sexy older woman romp: larrikin Bridget Jones losing her knickers in the Nespresso machine while making post-coital coffee for Darcy, perhaps.  Shirley Valentine feeling all cosy as she eats calamari at her beachside table. Forget all that. This isn’t like that at all. For a start, it doesn’t pander to the popular modern fairytale that women can have endless sexual freedom without fear of repercussions — or kowtow to the cherished myth that if anything goes wrong, it is never her fault. The truth is that what you do and the choices you make matter, and sometimes they might matter for ever. Yvonne’s moment of madness tilts the axis of her safe, wooden-salad-bowl world and she knows, even as she spins off into the darkness, that she is responsible — though not, of course, for the shocking rape at the end of the first episode, which has already caused some upset. Several viewers and at least one rape charity have complained to the BBC. But how do people want sexual assault conveyed — wafty music and off-screen screams? I hate the abundant on-screen depiction of violence against women but here, for once, we had a rape that really was integral to the drama and faithful to the book. It was short, brutish and horrific, yet there was no nudity and nothing gratuitous. Most importantly, it wasn’t smoked at the edges with the repellent tease of soft porn; no lascivious hint of rakishly dishevelled bra straps and possible secret enjoyment here, thanks all the same. Apple Tree Yard has already caused controversy and divided opinion and the shocking rape at the end of the first episode, which has already caused some upset The aftermath, too, seemed grim and true; torn tights and pooling bruises, plus Yvonne’s dawning awareness of what her drunkenness might imply to others, now and in the future. It certainly shows up the fuss about the supposed rape scene in last year’s Poldark for the silly nonsense it was, Elizabeth with her pompadour askew, pillowy lips trembling like raspberry jellies, terrified she might break a fingernail on Ross Poldark’s boy-band curls. Sometimes we should all calm down and accept that dramatists need to emphasise an ordeal has taken place and a woman has truly suffered, not just undergone a slo-mo inconvenience on an office carpet, or a smoulder on the linen sheets of a bygone age. And if rape charities were complaining about that, they won’t like what is coming up next in Apple Tree Yard. Least of all the moments when two female characters are called upon to give sexual testimony in court. As they do so, viewers are led to understand that some of the jurors lose sympathy with the women, as their expressions curdle with disgust. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next At last! A TV show that says women over 50 are sexy (wobbly... 'Best Actress BAFTA already won by Emily Watson': Apple Tree... Share this article Share I have seen all four episodes of Apple Tree Yard and if Emily Watson doesn’t win a sackful of awards for her still, spare portrayal of the troubled doctor, then I will gladly give back my spare rib. There are moments when slow realisations dapple across her face like scudding clouds, sometimes she puts her head in her hands as if it were heavier than lead. In her world, men are beastly, other women are not always warm and supportive, the law is inviolable and dreadful responsibility is hers. Apple Tree Yard is written by a woman, directed by a woman, produced by a woman and features a woman in a central role who portrays the equivocality of a modern woman who is tired of always behaving and doing the right thing. What is particularly notable is that it is unsparing drama that, for once, bends to no politically correct doctrine and doesn’t lard the action with feminist-approved tropes. No quarter or special treatment is given to female characters, who neither seek victim status nor are awarded it. It’s almost a miracle, because most TV and film drama today comes freighted with the weight of politically correct expectation. We all have to suffer this in case — God forbid — a woman gets blamed for something, or an eight-year-old will cry into her pillowcase if the next Dr Who isn’t a woman. What Apple Tree Yard shows is that everyone, even women, must sink or swim in their own sea of stories. And I liked it because it was real. A remake that makes my heart sink  Sandra Bullock (pictured)  is set to star in the all-female reboot of Ocean’s Eleven Last week I was in New York, trying my best not to get caught up in any women’s march. Impossible, as it turned out. ‘Get off the damn sidewalk or join the damn protest,’ a terrifying matriarch bellowed at me, somewhere near Trump Tower. Quite good life advice, I thought, scurrying away from the massed squeal of ‘pussyhats’ towards the Upper East Side. But there was no peace there, either. Along Fifth Avenue were the unmistakable signs of Hollywood: lorries, food wagons, people with clipboards looking important. I had stumbled across the film set for Ocean’s Eight, the all-female reboot of Ocean’s Eleven.  That, as Clooney fans might recall, was the 2001 heist movie that starred Brad Pitt and George as criminal masterminds. My heart sank. It sank without trace, in fact, like the last all-female Hollywood reboot — the abysmal Ghostbusters, which took a classic comedy with four guys and turned them into four gals. I suppose we are meant to feel a sense of emancipation at these she-films. However, it is hard to shake the suspicion that Hollywood will only bankroll all-women films if clever all-men have established the genre first. Female ensembles remain too financially and artistically risky to consider without the gold-plated security of a previously tested, box office-proof all-male one. The criminal she-cast includes Sandra Bullock, Cate Blanchett and Helena Bonham Carter, who has been made to dye her hair blonde for the role. Helen’s hair! She looks like a miniature guardsman in a sun-bleached busby. Surely it’s a look that can only work if she is playing a character called Gangsta Tweetie Pie? Still, it’s all a bit depressing. I feel the same about all-women films as I do about all-women shortlists. Which is that they diminish instead of enable. And ultimately do us all a disservice. The Second Coming would come second to this...  Jay Z and Beyonce live like a king and queen, in a life encrusted with emeralds and yachts and gold-plated importance. This week’s announcement that Queen Bey is pregnant with ye royal twins could not be passed off with a newspaper announcement or anything so everyday.  There had to be nude pictures. And a bizarre photoshoot, orchestrated by a artist slash sculptor slash photographer Awol Erizku. Beyonce announced her pregnancy this week with a bizarre photoshoot, orchestrated by a artist slash sculptor slash photographer Awol Erizku I can just imagine his instructions. ‘Beyonce, sit in front of the wall of flowers. Do you really need that dress? Take it off, sister! This is a baby announcement after all.  Get into your bra and your big pants. Yeah, the burgundy bra and the silky blue knickers, the ones that look like they come from a supermarket. I know! The green netting on the head! Put the green netting on the head!’ he would shout. Awol by name, awol by nature. Could this be any more grandiose? It makes Baby Jesus look like an overlooked afterthought. The Second Coming would come second. And what on earth will happen when the babies are actually born? Sorry Kate, disrobing isn't empowering  Kate Moss has just posed naked for W magazine (pictured) Excuse me, but is anyone out there actually keeping their clothes on this week? Even game old gal Kate Moss has just posed naked for W magazine. She is almost totally in the nip, full frontal, her entire coochy-coo out there like M&S had never invented the cotton-rich high-leg.  Apparently Kate is sending out an important message for their Powerful Woman issue — which is that any 43-year-old woman can look this good, with equal amounts of judicious airbrushing and a quart of Mac Face & Body foundation. I just worry about what kind of message Kate and Beyonce’s pix send out to young women like Vicky Balch. She is the 21-year-old who lost her leg in the Alton Towers crash two years ago. Since then, Vicky has had her low points and even considered suicide. Now that she has her confidence back, she has ‘empowered’ herself by posing naked. Why has taking your clothes off come to represent strength and feminist power? Vicky’s courage shows every time she steps out of her front door and gets on with her life. She doesn’t need to get her kit off to prove to me that she is brave — and beautiful. Does Diane have an allergy? Only to principles  Diane Abbott (pictured) missed the Brexit Bill vote in Parliament this week claiming she was unwell Diane Abbott had one job to do this week — to vote in Parliament on the Brexit Bill, on one of the most historic days for our democracy. However, there was a problem. It was an electorally inconvenient vote for Diane, who did not want to follow the whip, nor disobey her ex-lover Jeremy Corbyn. A moral conundrum, yes, but perhaps not a tricky one for the woman who opposed private schools but sent her son to one anyway. Diane said she was too sick to vote. Her doctor was puzzled. Any allergies? Only to principles.   Johnny Depp earned £200 million just from the Pirates Of The Caribbean series but is still in financial difficulty As actors gather in Hollywood to out-anti-Trump each other during the Trumpety-Trump awards season, here is one issue of injustice and unfairness that they never address — the gasping amount of money they all earn. Their out-of-control salaries. The fact they get paid millions for remembering their lines and not bumping into the furniture, while others scrimp for a hill of beans. If that is not unethical and unequal, what is? Look at Johnny Depp. He earned £200 million just from the Pirates Of The Caribbean series. No wonder the likes of Benedict Cumberbatch and Tom Hiddleston scramble for their own lucrative superhero franchises. Despite his riches, Johnny is in financial difficulty, with his management company claiming he lives an ‘ultra-extravagant lifestyle’ that has ‘outpaced his earnings’. What has he spent it on? More than £59.6 million went on French castles, private islands, a record label, 45 luxury cars . . . and a London to Manchester train ticket, bought the day before travel. Pray for Johnny! The poor sucker is down to his last hundred mill!   Share or comment on this article e-mail 10 shares Most watched News videos Moment carer is caught on camera manhandling a dementia patient Ministry of Defence release build up to Marine A shooting Taliban fighter Woman filmed performing sex act in Florida court house Sky News presenter accidentally says 'pr**k' in Trump segment John Berocw says there's 'no issue' with baby being in commons Ivanka posts video of Arabella singing a song for Chinese New Year MoD video shows build-up to moment marine shoots Taliban fighter Moments after Audi R8 GT crashes after driving almost 200 mph Man hanging from windowsill of high flat falls to his death 'I'd like you to apologise': Moment outraged caller phones LBC Junkie holds young girl at knifepoint as he demands drugs from police Hilarious reactions by Swedes confronted with ten-metre dive EXCLUSIVE: Trump's Supreme Court pick Neil Gorsuch...

Reuters/Dado Ruvic Apple has dominated the mobile phone industry for ten years now and one of the reasons why the iPhone is a hot seller is because of its cameras. The iPhone 6s is currently the second most popular camera phone used on Flickr. As a matter fact, four out of the top five cameras used on the image hosting site are iPhones. Samsung, meanwhile, has consistently outdone itself with every Android release. The Samsung Galaxy S7 is one of the best smartphones in the world in terms of overall specs, and the quality photos it produces are top-notch as well. Let’s break down the camera specs and features of the iPhone 6s and the Galaxy S7 and see if Apple’s former flagship can beat Samsung’s latest jewel. The primary shooter of the iPhone 6s is a 12 MP camera with an f/2.2 aperture, phase detection autofocus and dual-LED flash. The iPhone 6s lacks optical image stabilisation (OIS), which is a great tool for those who have shaky hands. With OIS, jiggles and jolts won’t be a factor as steady shots are almost guaranteed every time. The iPhone 6s’ main camera has 4K video and 8 MP image recording capabilities to go along with other features like touch focus, face detection and HDR. The former Apple flagship has a 5 MP secondary camera with an f/2.2 lens. Selfies and Facetime sessions are worthwhile using the front-facing snapper, which is also able to produce quality 1080p HD videos at 30 frames per second and 720p slow motion videos at 240 frames per second. The Samsung Galaxy S7, on the other hand, furnishes a 12 MP primary camera that has LED flash, phase detection autofocus and the all-essential OIS. One notable difference between the Galaxy S7 and the iPhone 6s is that the Samsung flagship’s rear camera has a wider f/1.7 lens that absorbs significantly more light. This helps shots taken in low light conditions stand out. Furthermore, the Galaxy S7 is boosted by the South Korean tech titan’s Dual Pixel technology, which allows the camera to focus considerably faster while also adding sufficient amounts of detail to resulting images. This is because the technology makes each pixel on the image sensor equip two photodiodes instead of only one. The Galaxy S7’s colour rendering is well-balanced and never sloppy. Details in both highlights and shadows are correctly brought about by Samsung’s 12 MP camera to produce natural-looking images. The Samsung Galaxy S7’s 5 MP front camera is also better than the iPhone 6s’ selfie shooter because it has a wider f/1.7 lens. The S7 packs in more space, faces and objects without the need for a selfie stick.

The Karnataka government announced that it had approved Apple's proposal to "commence initial manufacturing operations" in a press release. Apple's desire to open a manufacturing hub in India started after Prime Minister Narendra Modi began promoting his "Made in India" initiative. Apple manufacturing partner Wistron will make the iPhones in a new plant, reportedly beginning with the iPhone 8. Over the past couple of months, Apple and Indian officials began narrowing down possibilities to manufacture products locally. Last month, Apple finally chose a Karnataka-based facility over competing bids from other Indian states Gujarat, Maharashtra and Telangana. During negotiations, Apple was said to be seeking a number of tax and other incentives, including the possibility of long-term duty exemptions. The government said it's in discussions with Apple for other potential collaborations, but declined to say what they could be. The move is a major step for Apple as it looks to solidify its footing in the subcontinent so it can access India's customer base. Tag: India 15 comments Top Rated Comments (View all) willmtaylor 7 hours ago at 06:04 pm I wonder how many here will complain about India's protectionist policies? I wonder how many here have the slightest idea what that means. :D Rating: 4 Votes truthertech 4 hours ago at 09:18 pm This is mostly interesting because of the fairly extreme manufacturing processes involved in building an iPhone. I'm not an expert, but it does not seem to be a product you can just crank out easily on an existing line. It seems like the outlay to build/set up the factory would be huge, and would take quite a while to ramp up. Maybe if all the parts are from suppliers elsewhere and they're just assembling in India it's not as much expense and overhead to tool out the factory? Or maybe it's really not as hard as I'm imagining and/or there's already a lot of infrastructure in place. Either way, it seems like Apple must be expecting to sell a huge number of devices or it wouldn't be worth the investment. I imagine from a supply chain perspective, if the product is of identical quality and the cost of production is comparable, the more companies and locations making your stuff the better. Lets you pit manufacturers against each other, and gives you backup options if your main partner has problems for whatever reason. Foxconn and Pegatron are primarily just assemblers. Most of the products come from around the world. That's why it is feasible to return some manufacturing to USA where it would be a huge boost for engineering jobs, even if highly automated. Here's a fairly recent list, and people may be surprised how many parts are made in USA or made by US companies, but outsourced for production. Where are Apple products made: Which companies make the iPhone - and where? * Accelerometer: Bosch in Germany. Invensense in the United States. * Audio Chipsets and Codec: Cirrus Logic in the United States (outsourced for manufacturing). * Baseband processor: Qualcomm in the United States (outsourced for manufacturing). * Batteries: Samsung in South Korea. Huizhou Desay Battery in China. * Cameras: Sony in Japan. OmniVision in the United States produces the front-facing FaceTime camera chip but subcontracts TMSC (in Taiwan) for manufacturing. * Chipsets and Processors: Samsung in South Korea and TSMC in Taiwan. Alongside their partner GlobalFoundries in the United States. * Controller Chips: PMC Sierra and Broadcom Corp in the United States (outsourced for manufacturing). * Display: Japan Display and Sharp in Japan. LG Display in South Korea. * DRAM: TSMC in Taiwan. SK Hynix in South Korea. * eCompass: Alps Electric in Japan. * Fingerprint sensor authentication: Authentec makes it in China but outsources it to Taiwan for manufacturing. * Flash memory: Toshiba in Japan and Samsung in South Korea. * Gyroscope: STMicroelectronics in France and Italy. * Inductor coils (audio): TDK in Japan. * Main Chassis Assembly: Foxconn and Pegatron in China. * Mixed-signal chips (such as NFC): NXP in Netherlands. * Plastic Constructions (for the iPhone 5c): Hi-P and Green Point in Singapore. * Radio Frequency Modules: Win Semiconductors (module manufacturers Avago and RF Micro Devices) in Taiwan. Avago technologies and TriQuint Semiconductor in the United States. Qualcomm in the United States for LTE connectivity. * Screen and Glass (for the display): Corning (Gorilla Glass) in the United States. GT Advanced Technologies produces the sapphire crystals in the screens. * Semiconductors: Texas Instruments, Fairchild and Maxim Integrated in the United States. * Touch ID sensor: TSMC and Xintec in Taiwan. * Touchscreen Controller: Broadcom in the United States (outsourced for manufacturing). * Transmitter and Amplification Modules: Skyworks and Qorvo in the United States (outsourced for manufacturing).

Article Link: Apple Supplier Wistron to Manufacture iPhones in India ('//www.macrumors.com/2017/02/02/apple-iphone-manufacturing-india-official/') [doublepost=1486109831][/doublepost]I understand people are skeptical about quality of iphones made in India. As someone else had pointed out in the comments section All the parts will be sourced from the current manufacturers. And would be assembled in India. Once when nokia was at its peak, nokia's facility in Chennai was globally the largest maker of phones with nearly 15mn phones shipping out per month. And similarly most parts were sourced from outside. I think Apple could make a fortune assembling in India. Quality compromise is a false stereotype associated to India. And certainly apple wouldn't choose to make compromised products.

Over the holiday season, the company raked in $78.3 billion, up 3% from this time last year, and it made $23.4 billion on that take, slightly less than the $24.2 billion it made this time last year. Apple claims that revenue figure is an all-time record, and it also reported an all-time earnings-per-share record of $3.36 for the quarter. Gross margin rang in at 38.5%, down slighly from the 40% figure from this time last year. Those record numbers rode in on the back of 78.3 million iPhones sold, a 5% increase over this time last year. Apple made $54.4 billion off its phone business, also up 5% from this time last year. iPad sales continue to decline, however. The company moved 13 million of its slates last quarter, down 19% from a year ago, and it took in $5.5 billion from those sales, a 22% decline. Mac sales more or less held steady at 5.4 million, a 1% increase in units sold, and those sales took in another $7.2 billion for the company. Apple's services business continues to enjoy healthy growth. All told, that division took in $7.1 billion in revenue, up 18% from this time last year. Meanwhile, the Other Products catch-all scraped up $4 billion, down 8% from this time last year. CEO Tim Cook says the Apple Watch set a revenue record last quarter, but it apparently wasn't enough to buoy the S.S. Other Products. For its next quarter, Apple expects to take in $51.5 billion to $53.5 billion in revenue and produce gross margins of 38% to 39%.   Tags: Miscellaneous Mac User name:  Password:  Remember me Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

Here's our transcript of the call. Apple CEO Tim Cook and CFO Luca Maestri spoke with analysts during the company's Q1 2017 earnings call. Here's our ongoing live transcript of their remarks! If you want more info on Apple's results, we recommend Six Color's ace charts for the quarter.* Cook's opening remarks Tim Cook Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks very much for joining us. I'm very happy to share with you the outstanding results of Apple's December quarter. We generated the highest quarterly revenue in Apple's history, along with all-time unit and revenue records for iPhone and Apple Watch; all-time revenue records for services and Mac; and all-time revenue records for four out of our five geographic segments. The strong performance of our business also produced all-time record earnings-per-share. Revenue in the quarter was 78.4 billion dollars, which was above the top of our guidance range. iPhone had a tremendous quarter thanks to exceptional demand that beat our own internal expectations. While iPhone 7 is our most popular model, we saw especially strong demand for iPhone 7 Plus, which was a higher portion of the new product mix than we've ever seen with Plus models in the past. Demand for iPhone 7 Plus exceeded supply throughout the quarter, and we came into supply/demand balance in January. iPhone 7 Plus has earned rave reviews for its advanced new features, especially the dual-camera system, which produces stunning portraits and high-quality zoom. This is a uniquely Apple feature that is surprising and delighting our users. Both iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are empowering our customers to be more productive, more engaged, and more expressive than ever by integrating hardware, software, and services to create experiences that only Apple can deliver. It was our best quarter ever for services, with almost 7.2 billion dollars in revenue. App Store customers broke all-time records during the holiday quarter, including 3 billion dollars in purchases in December alone, making it the App Store's single best month ever. Our innovative and vibrant developer community has created over 2.2 million apps for doing almost anything that you can imagine. Apple's developer community has now earned over 60 billion dollars, including over 20 billion [dollars] in 2016 alone. Revenue from our music business grew for the third quarter in a row, and our AppleCare and iCloud storage services had all-time record results. Apple Pay continued its strong momentum, with its number of users more than tripling over the past year, and hundreds of millions of transactions and billions of dollars in purchases in the December quarter alone. Transaction volume was up over 500% percent year-over-year as we expanded to four new countries, including Japan, Russia, New Zealand, and Spain, bringing us into a total of 13 markets. Apple Pay on the Web is delivering our partners great results. Nearly two million small businesses are accepting invoice payments with Apple Pay through Intuit QuickBooks Online, FreshBooks, and other billing partners, and beginning this quarter, Comcast customers can pay their monthly bill in a single touch with Apple Pay. Services are becoming a larger part of our business, and we expect the revenues to be the size of a Fortune 100 company this year. Our services offerings are now driving over 150 million paid customer subscriptions; this includes our own services and third-party content that we offer on our stores. We feel great about this momentum, and our goal is to double the size of our services business in the next four years. The Mac not only returned to growth, but generated its highest quarterly revenue ever. Our latest data shows that most Mac customers are buying their first Mac, with the vast majority of them coming from a Windows PC. The new MacBook [Pro] Touch with Touch Bar is an outstanding example of the innovation made possible by integrating world-class hardware and software. We were supply-constrained for the new MacBook Pro throughout the December quarter, and are just now coming into supply/demand balance. It was also our best quarter ever for Apple Watch — both units and revenues — with holiday demand so strong that we couldn't make enough. Apple Watch is the best-selling smartwatch in the world, and also the most-loved, with the highest customer satisfaction in its category by a wide margin. Apple Watch is the ultimate device for a healthy life, and it's the gold standard for smartwatches. We couldn't be more excited about Apple Watch. We're also thrilled with the response to AirPods: Customers love the magical experience AirPods are delivering, and if you haven't tried them yet, you'll be delighted when you do. They're far ahead of anything else on the market today, and we're working hard to catch up with the incredible demand. With AirPods off to a fantastic start; a strong, full first year for Apple Watch; and Beats Headphones offering a great wireless experience using the Apple-designed W1 chip, we now have a rich lineup of wearable products. Their design, elegance, and ease of use make us very excited about the huge growth potential for wearables going forward. Our ecosystem is broadening to more and more of the areas where people spend their time: at the gym, on the go, in the home, and on the job. For example, every major automaker is committed to supporting CarPlay, with over 200 different models announced including five of the top ten selling models in the United States. There are well over a million people using CarPlay now, and this continues to grow rapidly. We're leading the industry by being the first to integrate home automation into a major platform with iOS 10. With Siri and the new Home app in iOS 10, everywhere you go you can easily and securely all of your home accessories with your iPhone, iPad, or your Apple Watch. The number of HomeKit-compatible accessories continues to grow rapidly, with many exciting solutions announced just this month, including video cameras, motion detectors, and sensors for doors, windows, and even water leaks. Perhaps even more importantly, we are unmatched when it comes to securing your home with HomeKit-enabled door locks, garage doors, and alarm systems. I'm personally using HomeKit accessories in the Home app to integrate iOS into my home routine: Now, when I say "Good Morning" to Siri, my house lights come on and my coffee starts brewing. When I go to the living room to relax in the evening, I use Siri to adjust the lighting and turn on the fireplace. And when I leave the house, a simple tap of my iPhone turns the lights off, adjusts the thermostat down, and locks the doors. When I return to my house in the evening as I'm near my home, the house prepares itself for my arrival automatically by using a simple geofence. This level of home automation was unimaginable just a few years ago, and it's here today with iOS and HomeKit. We're making great progress in the enterprise market alongside our major partners. The combination of iOS and Cisco Technology is giving companies everywhere the opportunity to vastly improve the user experience for their mobile employees. With enhanced networking performance, up to 8x faster roaming, better reliability for apps, and native voice experience, we're excited about how much more productive the workforce will be with these capabilities. In fact, the total number of joint customer opportunities has grown over 70% since last quarter. Enterprises are using IBM's new mobile-at-scale design and development model to deploy multiple iOS apps with speed and efficiency. For example, Fennar [sic] is transforming airport maintenance, and Cemex is revamping activities from attracting new clients to invoicing to after-sale support. And later this spring, SAP will be rolling out its SDK for iOS, providing its community of more than 2.5 million developers the tools to build powerful, native iOS apps that leverage the SAP HANA cloud platform. We're delighted with how these partnerships are making it even easier for enterprise customers to transform how work gets done with iOS. As we reflect on a record-breaking December quarter, I'd like to thank our developers, our business partners, and our employees for their incredible contributions and commitment, and I'd like to thank all of our customers around the world for their excitement and loyalty, which ultimately drives these results. On foreign exchange and original Apple TV content Katie Huberty, Morgan Stanley: First, Luca, what are the factors that caused you to widen the gross margin guidance for the March quarter, and what are the one or two factors that put you at the low end, versus the tailwinds that might put you at the high end of that range? Luca Maestri If you look back at our history, 100 points range for gross margin is not unusual; clearly, during a period when foreign exchange is very volatile, we think it's more prudent to broaden the range of it. I mentioned that we expect, assuming that rates don't move too much, we expect foreign exchange to be a major negative as we move from the December to the March quarter. You know that the dollar appreciated significantly toward the end of the December quarter, and so we've got 80 basis points of sequential headwind from foreign exchange. We also have the sequential loss of leverage, which is typical of our seasonality, but we expect to offset these two impacts with cost efficiencies and also with our mix of products and services. So, y'know, obviously, if the dollar is a little less strong than it is today, we could do a bit better on gross margins; obviously, we continue to work very hard on our cost efficiency, so we'll see where we land. Katie Huberty, Morgan Stanley: Tim, there's a reasonable probability that you may get access to the 200+ billion of cash that's been locked overseas, so I think it would be helpful to just get an update on your views around potentially larger M&A [mergers and acquisitions], and some of the areas of interest that you've noted in the past like owning more original content to penetrate more of the TV opportunity that the company has long talked about addressing? Tim Cook I am optimistic, given what I'm hearing, that there would likely be some sort of tax reform this year, and it does seem like there are people in both parties that would favor a repatriation as a part of that, so I think that's very good for the country and good for Apple. What we would do with it, let's wait and see exactly what it is. But, as I've said before, we are always looking at acquisitions; we acquired 15-20 companies per year for the last four years, and we look for companies of all sizes. There's not a size that we would not do based on just the size of it, it's more about the strategic value of it. In terms of original content, we put our toe in the water — we have put our toe in the water with doing some original content for Apple Music, and that will be rolling out through the year; we're learning from that, and we'll go from there. The way that we participate in the changes that are going on in the media industry — that I fully expect to accelerate, from the sort of cable bundle beginning to break down — one, we started the new Apple TV a year ago, and we're pleased with how that platform has come along. We have more things planned for it, but it's come a long way in a year, and it gives us a clear platform to build off of. Two, embedded in the 150 million paid subscriptions that I mentioned in my opening comments, there are a number of third-party services that are a part of that where we participate economically in some of that by offering our platform and selling and distributing. And then thirdly, we are obviously with our toe in the water, we're learning a lot about the original content business, and thinking about ways that we could play in that. On the services business and China Amit Daryanani, RBC Capital Markets: I really appreciate the information you guys are providing around your services business, which is up to 18% year-over-year. Can you just talk about — how much of that do you think is growth in your install base versus increased monetization on a per-iOS device basis? It's weird to think about those in two separate terms. Luca Maestri Those are the two key elements for us, and what's particularly interesting to us is to see the number of people that are transacting on our stores is increasingly strong double-digits, and we're also seeing that the ARPU [average revenue per user] per paying customer is increasing double-digits, right? So it's the combination of the two, obviously — the quality and the quantity of content that we make available in our services improves all the time, and we also see that as people get into the platform and start transacting on the platform and we keep track of their behavior over time, we actually see that they tend to spend more and more over time. And that's why we're excited about the future of the services business, and as Tim said, we have a goal — it's already become a very large business; it's going to be a Fortune 100 company this year — but we have a goal to double it over the next four years. Amit Daryanani, RBC Capital Markets: There's been a fair amount of discussions around your market share in China and what's happening over there; your numbers actually look fairly impressive in Greater China, China specifically. So could you just talk about what are the demand trends you're seeing over there on the ground, and how do you see that transpire for the year? Tim Cook If you look at how we did in the quarter, as I think Luca shared, our Greater China revenue was down 12%, and about four points of that was currency-related, so it's an 8 point decline in constant currency. And then, within Greater China, if you look at the PRC [People's Republic of China], our revenue was flat year-over-year, and that was against the all-time record quarter; and if you look at that on a constant currency basis, it was actually up six. So it's a significantly better performance, on sort of every way you look at it versus what we had experienced the prior three quarters. Underneath that, what we've seen is that iPhone 7 was the best-selling smartphone in China during the quarter according to Quantar; Singles Day — which is a huge day in China, as you know — we were the most popular U.S. brand on Alibaba. We set a new record for services in China, as the company did, and Mac revenue was up double digits year over year. iPad units were also up double digits in mainland China which was, obviously different than the trend that we saw in the balance of the world. We also saw 50% of our iPhone sales in China were to switchers and first-time buyers, which is a very high number that we're pleased with. Obviously, our total install base continues to grow there, in the strong double digits. That said, the challenges that are there: One, the currency has devalued 6% year over year, and two, Hong Kong remains a very very difficult market. And so I look at it and I'm encouraged with the significant improvement, but we're not without challenges there, and I wouldn't want to imply that, although I do like many many things that I've seen and how broad-based the Pluses were across our product line. On growing services Shannon Cross, Cross Research: Can you talk a bit more about the services business? What I'm trying to figure out is: I think the number was, you're going to be doubling within the next four years — at least that's your expectation — so, what gets you there? I don't know, maybe if you talk about geography, and how penetrated you are in certain geographies, and as you grow your services business, is there anything we should keep in mind from a margin perspective? Would these be lower-margin services or similar, just so we can think about the trajectory and the contribution to the bottom line. Luca Maestri Within the services business, we have a number of categories: The App Store is the one that's driving significant growth right now, I said in my opening comments that it grew 43% — 13 weeks over 13 weeks, it grew even more for the quarter, right — and what we like about the App Store is that it's truly a global platform, so we are seeing significant growth not only in the developed markets where you expect to see a lot of transaction volume, but we see great growth in places like China, for example. And we know that there are parts of the world where we can do better — that we can grow, for example, our developer community in a number of emerging markets — and so, as we look at the number of people that transact growing double-digits, we see the amount spent per paid account growing so well, we think that the App Store is going to be a significant driver of growth. On the Music front, we are the market leader in digital music, and obviously now by having the combination of the download business with the streaming service — which we didn't have until recently — we've been able to bring our music business back to growth. We've grown over the last three quarters, and we feel very good about that. Tim has talked about original content, we've had very good success with exclusives, so we know it's another business that we can grow. Our iCloud storage business is growing very quickly, and so that is a business that also, at a geographic level, we can continue to grow significantly. Our AppleCare business is growing very well. A lot of it comes from the fact that our install base of devices around the world continues to grow very well — strong double digits — and as we've explained in the past, the vast majority of the services that we provide is not driven by what we sell during the last 90 days, it's much more driven by the install base, and that gives us a tailwind. We're also opening up several new markets because we're accepting new forms of payment, and therefore it's easier for — particularly for international customers to take advantage of our services. You were asking about the margin profile: We said it many times; in aggregate, our services business tends to have margins that are above company averages; they help us quite a bit from a margin standpoint. Within the services business, we have very different margin profiles; also, because as you know, we account for some of these services in different ways — in some cases we transact on a buy/sell basis, in other cases we perform as agents, for example, to our developers, right? — and that drives different margin percentages. On emerging markets and currency issues Shannon Cross, Cross Research: In terms of elasticity of demand, and some of the moves from a currency perspective: In the past, there was some concern in some of the emerging markets that you were basically not able to — you weren't getting the volumes because you had to raise the ASPs given the currency, but you talked about a lot of the emerging markets actually doing pretty well this quarter; so, I'm just curious. You've raised the price on the iPhone 7 Plus: What have you seen, and what are your customers saying about willingness to pay up? Luca Maestri I was looking back: Since June of 2014 — so, we're talking about two and a half years ago — the dollar has strengthened 25% against the basket of currencies where we do business. And so, obviously, it is a difficult situation for us. I mentioned that foreign exchange is a significant headwind for us, both at the revenue level and at the gross margin level. In emerging markets, it's incredible: The level of interest for our products continues to be phenomenal; the brand continues to be very aspirational; there are more and more people that can afford our products around the world. The middle class is growing in places like China, India, Brazil — but certainly, a strong dollar doesn't help us. And therefore, when we make pricing decisions, we need to be very careful. We always want to find the optimal balance between units, revenue, and margin, and it becomes more difficult as the dollar appreciates. On gross margin Brian White, Drexel: I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about gross margins: Sales obviously beat the high end of your revenue range, it looks like gross margin was dead down the middle. Can you talk about the pushes and takes of the gross margins in the quarter, please? Luca Maestri We were actually at the high end of the range for gross margins; we had guided 38 to 38.5 [percent], and we came in at 38.5 exactly. And really, the slight improvement over the midpoint of the guidance range was due to the fact that our revenue was ahead of our expectations, and so we got a bit more leverage over the increased revenue levels. We feel very good about the gross margins for the quarter. Again, keeping in mind the strong dollar, it doesn't help us on that front. On India and the iPhone Brian White, Drexel: I didn't hear much mentioned about India. How did India perform with the iPhone, and how should we think about it for 2017, especially with the 4G network going up? Tim Cook That's a really good question. Despite the de-monetization move in India that created lots of economic pressure there last quarter, despite that, we had all-time record revenue results. And so we were very happy about that. The de-monetization impact has not worked its way through yet; it's still definitely having some overhang, but I think in the longer term, it's a great move. I feel really good about how we're doing there. We are in discussions on a number of things, including retail stores and fully intend to invest significantly in the country and believe it's a great place to be. On switchers and upgraders Simona Jankowski, Goldman Sachs: I wanted to dig in a little bit more into the iPhone upside in the quarter, with record revenues in every region except for Greater China, I think you touched on the percentage of switchers in Greater China, but can you give a little more color on the split of upgrades and switchers in some of the other regions and overall as well? Tim Cook We did have an exceptional quarter with iPhone, and that was with the backdrop of not predicting the demand very well, and the iPhone 7 Plus, and therefore being in constraint on it through the quarter. If you look at the absolute number of upgraders, it was the highest that we've seen in any quarter, and if you look at the switcher number, it's the highest that we've seen in any quarter. If you look at the upgrade rate, it's similar to last year, however I think the big asterisk — and I share all of this with you for transparency's sake — but I would tell you that the way we look at this is, in a quarter where you have a supply constraint, it's difficult to draw too many conclusions from it. But I wanted to share that with you anyway, so that you have the backdrop. On the iPhone mix in mainland China Simona Jankowski, Goldman Sachs: One follow-up on China, specifically: As your comps get easier this year, I was curious if you think you're going to be returning to growth in that region? And then, just to give us the context, I know that you talked about the 6% constant currency increase in revenue in mainland China, but I'm curious if you strip out the double-digit increase in iPad and MacBook, and potentially the mix-shift to the 7 Plus, I'm curious what underlying iPhone units did in mainland China. Tim Cook That's a big question, and I don't have the answer in front of me. [chuckles] If you look at 7 Plus, it was the most popular Plus model that we've ever had; it set a unit record, so that I can share. In terms of how are we going to do… y'know, we don't provide guidance at the segment level, but sitting here today, for Q2, I wouldn't expect the year-over-year performance to be dramatically different than the year-over-year performance in Q1. The real, sort of, comp really begins in the following quarter to a more significant degree, and we'll have to see how that plays out as we get closer to it. On iPhone upgrades Toni Sacconaghi, Bernstein: I just wanted to better understand the upgrade rate dynamics. So I think iPhone units on a sell-through basis were about 8%; you had an extra week, which gave you about 8%; I understand there were differences of the timing of the launch, so — making all those adjustments, it looks like iPhone units were probably up low single digits. But Luca, you alluded to the fact that your install base is growing double-digits. So that would kind of suggest to me that the upgrade rate, the upgrade percentage is actually declining. More specifically, I'd just like your broader perspective on how investors should think about upgrade rates: It looks like they peaked in the iPhone 6 cycle, and it looks like they've been extending going lower, replacement cycles have been extending over the last couple years; I think some of the U.S. carriers alluded to that as well. So, I'm wondering if you could kind of step back and just talk a little bit more broadly about how investors should think about (or what the trajectory has been over the last two years) and how investors should think going forward. Do you believe that there opportunities for that upgrade rate to improve? Or replacement cycles to accelerate going forward? And what are some of the considerations we should think about? Luca Maestri I think that this is a good question. There are a number of points that I want to make, starting with the growth and install base of iPhone — seeing as it's growing strong double digits, and that's very good for us for a number of reasons, including the fact that it's a big driver for our services business. When we look at it geographically, I think we see different developments. For example, we felt very very good about the unit growth that we had in many markets around the world. You've been quoting an overall total company growth rate, but when we look at it at a country-specific level, there were a lot of countries — actually, I would say the majority of the countries where iPhone units grew strong double digits, starting here in the United States. For example, the fact that annual upgrade programs are becoming more and more popular is proving to be a positive for us. The same happened in a number of countries around the world, starting with Canada and Australia, but also many places in western Europe as well; Japan grew double digits in terms of units. So, I think geographically, we are seeing very very good performance. The point that I need to make when you think about upgrade rates: Clearly, this issue of the strong Dollar doesn't help us. Could we sell significantly more and significantly faster from an upgrade cycle standpoint in places outside the United States where we've had — we've been forced to increase prices by up to 20%, 30%, 40% percent in certain countries. And you think about the impact that this is adding on local demand, obviously that doesn't help us. But overall, I would say, as Tim said, when we look at the upgrade rate for — and we look at it from the standpoint of the new phones, right, the new generation of phones — the upgrade rate, the percentage of people who have upgraded to the new phone has been very similar to what we've seen last year. The 6 cycle was certainly a phenomenon cycle: There was pent-up demand for the larger-screen phones, and certainly as we look ahead, we have a role to play. The more we are able to innovate with new generations of products, clearly, that plays a role in the upgrade rate. On the Qualcomm lawsuit Toni Sacconaghi, Bernstein: Back in April 2012, [Tim] said on one of these earnings calls: "I've always hated litigation, and I continue to hate it, and I highly prefer to settle versus battle," yet you recently decided to initiate a lawsuit against Qualcomm. I'm wondering if you can comment on the ostensible change or departure from this viewpoint, and what would be a successful end result of this litigation, and whether you can confirm whether there's any potential gross margin risk in the future as a result of this litigation? Tim Cook I feel the same way I did in April of 2012; I don't like litigation and view it as a last resort. And so, you should take from our filing that we viewed it as — we didn't see another way forward. They were insisting on charging royalties for technologies that they had nothing to do with, and so we were in a situation where the more we innovated with unique features — like Touch ID, or advanced displays, or cameras just to name a few — the more money Qualcomm would collect for no reason, and the more expensive it would be, therefore, for us to innovate. It's somewhat like buying a sofa and you charge somebody a different price depending on the price of the house that it goes into. From our point of view, this doesn't make sense, and we don't believe it will pass muster in the courts. In addition to that, they as a part of their increasingly radical steps they were taking were trying to uphold that model, they withheld a billion dollars in payments that they owed us. And so, we felt like we had no choice was the net of it. In terms of where it goes, we'll see. Y'know, I don't like litigation, and so if there's another way, then that would be great, but at this point I don't see it. I fully expect at this point in time that it will take some time, but in the end, I think common sense will prevail, and the courts will see it for what it is. So that's the way I see it. On the enduring spirit of the iPad Steve Milonovich, UBS: First I wanted to ask about the iPad: It looked like it was about to turn possibly even positive, and you said it was above your plan[ned guidance], but I think it was pretty well below the [Wall] Street's expectations, and the ASP deteriorated pretty significantly — I don't know if that's a mix shift — but maybe you can talk about the iPad and what you see going forward. Tim Cook The iPad, Steve, we had a 1.6 million unit swing on channel inventory between the years. In the year-ago quarter we increased by 900 [million], in this quarter, we decreased by 700. On top of that, and from an ASP point of view, in the year-ago quarter we launched the iPad Pro 13-inch — that would be the iPad with obviously the highest price on it — we would have done the channel fill plus the launch of the product, and so that would have bolstered the ASPs in that particular quarter. In addition to all of that, we did under-call the number of iPads that would be in demand for the quarter, and that compounded a shortage issue that we had with one of our suppliers. All in all, there was quite a few things going on there. If I sort of zoom out of the 90-day clock and look at it, we've got some exciting things coming on iPad. I still feel very optimistic about where we can take the product. When we look at the number of people buying iPads for the first time — which is a good thing to look at from a point of view of whether things are reaching a penetration point or not — the numbers indicate that it's not close to that kind of thing. The customer sat numbers are through the roof; literally, the customer sat for the iPad Pro is 99%. It's stunning. And so I see a lot of good things and hope for better results, but we are still currently in this shortage issue now, and I'm not projecting to get out of that totally during the quarter. It will damper this [upcoming] quarter somewhat. But again, beyond the 90-day clock, I'm very bullish on iPad. On the iPhone surprising and delighting in the future Steve Milonovich, UBS: Investors tend to think of the iPhone as mature and technology improvements as incremental, yet I believe you think there's plenty of runway left in terms of purely new features. Do you think there are future enhancements coming that will be viewed as material by users — and particularly changes beyond form factor, beyond the way the phone looks — are there functional things coming over time that you think could surprise people? Tim Cook I think the smartphone is still in the early innings of the game. I think there's lots more to do; I think it's become — every year, it becomes more important to people's lives. There's more things people are doing with it. I talked a little bit about home automation, but I could have talked about health, I could have talked more about CarPlay; the use of it in the enterprise is growing significantly. When I look at all of these things — usage going up, app developers still innovating, we've got some exciting things in the pipeline — I feel really, really good about it. So, this is one that we… We think different about a bunch of things; maybe this is just one more. Thanks for tuning in this quarter, folks! Like us!

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it (Reuters) By Elizabeth Dwoskin and Craig Timberg By Elizabeth Dwoskin and Craig Timberg February 2 at 8:02 PM Follow @lizzadwoskin Follow @craigtimberg SAN FRANCISCO — The tech industry’s opposition to President Trump escalated Thursday as corporate leaders drafted a letter warning of the economic risks of his immigration policies, Uber’s chief executive quit an administration advisory board and Lyft pulled its ads from Breitbart News, the site founded by the White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon. The developments followed remarks this week from Apple, Amazon and other companies, which said they were exploring legal action against Trump’s executive order that temporarily barred travelers from seven majority-Muslim countries. Amazon and Expedia also joined a lawsuit brought by the state of Washington against the immigration ban. The actions underscored rising alarm along the West Coast’s tech archipelago from Silicon Valley to Seattle that Trump’s policies threaten a sector that has long been a driver of new wealth and innovation in an otherwise tepid economy. After attempting to reach out to Trump by attending a meeting at his hotel in New York, tech companies are preparing themselves for a high-stakes confrontation with the president. Trump’s quest to tighten immigration has struck particularly hard at left-leaning Silicon Valley, which relies on a flow of high-level talent from India, east Asia and elsewhere and sees diversity as core to its identity as an innovation hub. People shout slogans at the protest. (Kate Munsch/Reuters) “People come to Silicon Valley so they can build the American Dream, and this is one of the last places where the American Dream still kind of works,” said Jonathan Nelson, chief executive of Hackers/Founders, a 300,000-person global network of entrepreneurs and engineers. “If this happens, you’re going to completely kill the next 10 years of tech companies.” Some tech companies are now considering whether to move jobs out of the United States to places with more relaxed immigration policies, such as Vancouver, B.C., and Dublin, which have made clear they would welcome an influx of U.S.-based immigrant technology workers. “One of the sad ironies of this is that an administration that purports to understand business is threatening one of the core pillars of what has made Silicon Valley so successful and an engine of economic growth,” said Matt Mahan, chief executive of the social networking start-up Brigade. Tensions have been building since Friday night, when tech executives, including Apple’s Tim Cook and Google’s Sundar Pichai, began publicly denouncing the immigration ban. Protesters flooded U.S. airports and held rallies outside Google’s offices. In a flurry of emails and late-night phone calls among top executives, the industry began preparing a range of responses. A little more than half of U.S. start-ups that are estimated to be worth more than $1 billion were founded by immigrants, according to the National Foundation for American Policy, an Arlington think tank. And Silicon Valley is littered with immigrant success stories: Satya Nadella, the chief executive of Microsoft, is an immigrant from India; Google co-founder Sergey Brin is a refugee from the former Soviet Union; and Omid Kordestani, Twitter’s executive chairman, was born in Iran. Apple co-founder Steve Jobs was the son of a Syrian immigrant, leading Cook to say, in a letter denouncing Trump’s travel ban, that the company “wouldn’t exist” if such a ban had been in place. Sam Altman, the president of Silicon Valley’s Y Combinator, called the reaction to the immigration ban a watershed moment in which the tech industry — rivals and all — made the unusual move of coming together and drawing a line in the sand against a sitting president. (Jhaan Elker/The Washington Post) The steps taken by tech companies become more urgent after a draft of what appeared to be a Trump administration executive order limiting workers on H-1B visas circulated widely in Silicon Valley this week. The leaked order indicated the administration could cancel the annual lottery through which technology companies sponsor tens of thousands of engineers, as well as a special visa for start-up founders who want to move to the United States. A spokesman for the White House declined to comment on the leaked order or confirm its veracity. But White House press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters this week that the administration expects to scrutinize work visa programs closely as part of its immigration agenda. “There’s an overall need to look at all of these programs,” said Spicer. “And you’ll see both through executive action and through comprehensive measures a way to address immigration as a whole and the visa program.” As tensions built throughout the week, Uber chief executive Travis Kalanick and Tesla’s Elon Musk, who serve on Trump’s economic council, faced intense pressure to disavow their work with the administration, according to people familiar with the situation. Both have insisted, until now, that being at the table, and having the opportunity to influence the direction of the country, was better than not being at it. But on Thursday, Kalanick said that he had spoken with Trump and told him that he would step down. Musk declined requests for comment. Kalanick’s calculus changed after the company faced a huge outcry from the public for not joining Saturday’s protests at airports. In his letter, Kalanick said he made his decision after hearing the stories of Uber employees and drivers, in particular those of Emil Michael, a refugee from Egypt, and Thuan Pham, a refugee from Vietnam. Kalanick wrote that the executive order was hurting people across America and hurting Uber’s ability to make positive change in the country. “The implicit assumption that Uber (or I) was somehow endorsing the Administration’s agenda has created a perception-reality gap between who people think we are, and who we actually are,” he wrote. “There are many ways we will continue to advocate for just change on immigration but staying on the council was going to get in the way of that.” In separate letter, more than 115 Silicon Valley start-up founders and venture capitalists pleaded with the administration to cancel the immigration ban. “Silicon Valley flourishes because of our free and open culture of entrepreneurship and excellence,” they wrote. “The President’s actions yesterday not only negatively affect Tech’s competitiveness, they hurt the U.S. economy overall.” Another letter from executives at Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Apple and others is also being drafted, according to a person familiar with the deliberations who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the private matter. In interviews, technology company officials said they were looking into relocating people to overseas offices in Ireland and other places in Europe. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because the deliberations were still underway. “Tech companies are telling me they would rather set up subsidiaries or set up their companies in countries that are more welcoming and have friendlier immigration laws,” said Priya Alagiri, an immigration lawyer based in San Francisco who represents start-ups and tech firms. “They go to great lengths [to keep immigrant workers] because the workers are so highly talented and highly skilled.” Meanwhile, Lyft, Uber’s ride-hailing rival, said Thursday that it was pulling ads from Breitbart News, following the actions of hundreds of other companies, including Lenovo, HP and T-Mobile. Many of the firms criticized the site as being an anti-immigrant and racist platform. “One of Lyft’s core values is to uplift and support one another in all that we do,” said Adrian Durbin, Lyft’s director of communications. “We strive to ensure that our advertisements appear only on sites that share this value.” Timberg reported from Washington.

(File photo | AP) BENGALURU: It’s official. Made in India iPhones will soon come out of namma Bengaluru, with global technology leader Apple ready to set up a manufacturing base in India’s Silicon Valley. This will be Apple’s second big project for Bengaluru. In May last year, Apple had announced setting up of a design and development accelerator in the city to grow the iOS developer community. According to sources, Apple is set to partner with Taiwanese company Wistron’s existing facility at Peenya for assembling the iPhones. IT and BT Minister Priyank Kharge told Express that initial production of iPhones in Bengaluru is expected to start in another three months and all the necessary facilities for the same is being provided. However, he refused to disclose the volume of initial production and other specifics of the production plans. An elated Karnataka government, announcing the decision on Thursday, said, “Apple’s intentions to manufacture in Bengaluru will foster cutting edge technology eco-system and supply chain development in the state, which are critical for India to compete globally.” Apple’s representatives met Kharge and state government officials to discuss the initiative and possible collaborations with the government. The California-based technology major had sought several tax and other incentives, including long-term duty exemptions, to enter the manufacturing sector in India. The Union government had in May 2016 expressed its inability to offer any special sops for the company as any such gesture would be seen as discriminatory by other electronic manufacturers. Competitors Samsung and Xiaomi have already set up manufacturing bases in the country. According to state government sources, Karnataka would try to champion the cause of Apple and other high-end technology companies with the Union government, without affecting the interests of local companies. Local manufacturing is expected to help Apple price its phones more competitively in India as it currently attracts 12.5 per cent additional duty on imports.

Updated: Friday, February 3, 2017, 2:04 [IST] Subscribe to Oneindia News Bengaluru, Feb 2: Apple plans to make its iPhones in Bengaluru, said Karnataka's Minister of State for IT Priyank Kharge on Thursday. Representational image. "An Apple team discussed with us its proposal to set up a plant in Bengaluru to make iPhones for the Indian and global markets," said Kharge in a statement here. An Apple team, led by iPhone Operations Vice-President Priya Balasubramaniam, Government Affairs Head Ali Khanafer, iPhone Operations Director Dheeraj Chugh and Country Counsel Priyesh Povanna discussed the proposals with the state officials in the presence of the minister. "We welcome Apple's proposal to commence initial manufacturing operations in Karnataka. Its intentions to make iPhones in Bengaluru will foster the cutting-edge technology ecosystem and supply chain development in the state, which are critical for India to compete globally," said Kharge. "Apple's decision to make iPhones in Bengaluru has enhanced the city's reputation as the most preferred destination for foreign investment and validation of our policies to foster manufacturing, innovation and investments in the state," he said. The Silicon Valley-based global firm has been eyeing the India for a greater pie of its growing smartphones market, in which it sold 2.5 million iPhones as against a whopping 29 million by its Korean rival Samsung. Apple ships iPhones to India from Foxconn Technology firm in China and sells them through distributors and retailers, besides iStore and Imagine stores. Though the central government has told Apple that it would have to source 30 per cent of its components from Indian suppliers, Apple is seeking a 15-year tax holiday on import of components and equipment. With many states wooing Apple for its Indian plant in their cities, the iPhones maker has been exploring a best deal, including tax reliefs and exemptions from local sourcing.

However it is slowly but surely finding its way to markets around the world, and the good news for our friends and readers in Taiwan is that it looks like Apple Pay will finally be making its way to the country. According to Apple’s website, it seems that the service has been listed as “coming soon” and so far there are at least seven banks who will be participating. This includes the Cathay United Bank, CTBC Bank, E. Sun Commercial Bank, Standard Chartered Bank, Taipei Fubon Commercial Bank, Taishin International Bank, and Union Bank of Taiwan. Users in Taiwan are expected to get the same Apple Pay features as everyone else, which includes reward cards as well as support for online payments. When the service is launched, Taiwan will be the 14th market in which Apple Pay will be made available in. So far this includes Australia, Canada, China/Hong Kong, France, Japan, New Zealand, Poland, Russia, Singapore, Spain, Switzerland, the U.K., and the U.S. There is no word on when exactly the feature will be rolled out to users, but given that it says “Coming soon” we guess we’ll just have to wait and see.

Criticising Brussels, which ruled Apple owes the money, the company told the Oireachtas finance committee the EU had got it wrong and its attack on Irish sovereignty was “dangerous”. While the finance committee previously asked Apple chief Tim Cook to appear before TDs and senators, it was agreed to again ask the company to come before members. The second refusal was received this week. In a letter to the committee, Apple senior director for government, Claire Thwaites defended its tax arrangements, attacked the European Commission, and outlined its commitment to Ireland. “Apple abides by the law and we pay all the taxes we owe wherever we do business. We believe Apple is the largest corporate income taxpayer in Ireland and we never asked for nor ever received, any special deal on the taxes we pay. “We believe Apple is subject to exactly the same laws as every other business in the country, and Irish Revenue has confirmed many times that they provided no special deal.” Brussels argues Ireland did not collect enough tax from Apple over a 10-year period and that the company’s tax burden was reduced in what was an alleged breach of EU state aid rules. The damning ruling against Ireland, originally made in August last, threw the Government into disarray and it was forced to quickly reject it and defend its decision to appeal the ruling, which is ongoing. Ms Thwaites says that if the Brussels ruling its allowed stand, it would be like changing the rules of a game half-way through a match. “Taxes play an important role in our society and we believe in paying all the tax we owe on all that we earn. “However, the European Commission got it wrong, and its attack on Irish sovereignty is dangerous. “They took unilateral action and retroactively changed the rules, disregarding decades of Irish tax law, US tax law, as well as global consensus on tax policy, that everyone has relied on. “If the commission’s opinion is allowed to stand, Apple would pay 40% of all the corporate income tax collected in Ireland — this is unprecedented and, far from levelling the playing field, selectively targets Apple,” Ms Thwaites said. Apple told the committee that the opinion by Brussels that the iPhone maker owed Ireland €13bn had “no basis in fact or law” and it was confident it would be overturned after a hearing of the facts. But the finance committee heard yesterday that Ireland’s appeal on the EU case could take four years or more. While there is no specific date, the Government still has to draw down the funds, as agreed with Brussels, and put them in a special holding account. Apple told the committee in writing that it would continue to invest in Cork and around the country. Up to 6,000 people are now employed in Ireland, it said The letter added: “Ninety-three percent of our employees in Ireland are EU citizens and 44% are non-Irish nationals. “Our overall operations in Ireland support a total of 18,000 jobs, and last year we spent close to €200m with Irish companies.” READ MORE Visit the section home page here KEYWORDS Apple, tax, EU © Irish Examiner Ltd.

Appearing before the Oireachtas Finance Committee, Mr Noonan said he believed the EU Apple case amounted to “political input” and undermined the certainty about business taxes here. Committee senators and TDs quizzed the minister about why Ireland is appealing the EU case and what authorities knew here about “stateless companies” operating with little or no tax obligations. Mr Noonan said the appeal could take four years. So far €1.8m has been spent on lawyers fees in the appeal but there is no idea what the final bill could be. He told members there was “political input” in Europe into the Apple case but said this was because of the “mismatch” of tax rules between different jurisdictions, which is now being addressed. He said he didn’t think the European Commission were “having a go” at Ireland by taking the case, nonetheless, he said, “I don’t think Apple worldwide are paying sufficient tax.” However, the Apple ruling, released last August by Brussels, had undermined certainty here and “corporation tax offerings” here. This would remain so until the case is decided as there will be “uncertainty” [for companies] about what their tax liabilities might be. The case though had not affected investment here, he added. Mr Noonan was repeatedly questioned by Sinn Féin TD Pearse Doherty about where the intellectual property rights of Apple existed or belonged. The minister though refused to be drawn on this, saying it would form the “cornerstone” of Ireland’s appeal. AAA-PBP TD Richard Boyd Barrett argued that it had never been credible to let the profits go to an office that did not essentially exist and Irish people wanted to know why we were not taking the €13bn and instead giving millions of euro to lawyers to fight the tax payment. Mr Noonan insisted Ireland had got the right amount of taxes due to it from Apple. He insisted Brussels had “misused” its state aid powers by taking the Apple case against Ireland. “They [Apple] fully paid tax on profits generated in Ireland.” Meanwhile, the head of Revenue Niall Cody has refused to say when Ireland became aware that Apple was operating a so-called ‘stateless company’, saying this was because of tax “confidentiality”. The European Commission this week told the committee it began investigating Apple’s tax affairs here after the firm told a US senate hearing in 2013 it had arrangements with Ireland. Mr Cody declined to comment for tax “confidentiality” reasons, but he did say: “The idea nobody knew in the US until the senate hearing is just not true.” Mr Doherty accused Revenue of turning a “blind eye” on the situation for many years and also suggested officials may have known about any special tax arrangements as early as the 1990s.

Elyse Betters3 February 2017Laptops Pocket-lint Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment Apple seems to be actively lessening its reliance on Intel chips. According to Bloomberg, Apple is designing its own A-series ARM-based chips, even though Intel processors have powered Apple's Mac lineup for more than a decade. The company isn't going to dump Intel chips right away, but by all indications, it at least wants to dip its toes into the water by developing its own silicon for MacBooks and iMacs. For now, this ARM-based chip is being built with one idea in mind. In an attempt to save battery life, Apple reportedly wants to offload the Mac's "Power Nap" feature from the main Intel processor. Power Nap lets Macs run software updates, sync to iCloud, and more -- all while the computer sleeps. Some of these features require the Mac to be charging, however, but with a chip that requires less energy, Power Nap's features could maybe one day work with just the Mac's battery. Which MacBook is best for you? MacBook, MacBook Air or MacBook Pro? It's worth stressing Apple might want to ditch Intel altogether, too. Industry insiders have claimed that Apple wasn't happy when Intel didn't have Kaby Lake processors ready for the new MacBook Pro. Apple was forced to launch the machines running old microarchitecture. Also, maybe now, by developing its own silicon, it's ready to better coordinate macOS and Mac releases like it does with iPhone/iOS. Also, Apple has been investing a lot into its own series of chips for the last seven years, and it even designed an ARM-based chip - the T1 - for the MacBook Pro last autumn. (It controls the Touch Bar and Touch ID sensor.) Experimenting with ARM inside Macs seems like an obvious sign that Apple either wants to take more tasks away from the main Intel processor, or maybe even more closely combine iOS and MacOS. We'll know more this autumn, when Apple updates the MacBook Pro.

Market sentiment is shifting as investors turn their focus from potential positives such as tax reform to negatives (from the perspective of big business) such as a clampdown on immigration and the prospect of chaotic fighting in Congress over everything from President Donald Trump’s cabinet picks to the legality of his executive actions. Adding to the concern is currency volatility and fears of a trade war — if not outright war. Trump complained of foreign currency devaluations (weakening the "strong dollar" post-election trade) and directly named China and Japan as "planning money markets." He reportedly threatened to send troops into Mexico to get the "bad hombres" if Mexico City doesn't. And his national security advisor has formally put Iran "on notice" after a ballistic missile test. Not even a batch of strong earnings results and post-reporting surges by popular mega-cap tech stocks including Apple (AAPL) and Facebook (FB) this week has been able to reinvigorate broader buying interest. Apple blasted more than 6 percent higher on Wednesday to a record high after reporting a return to growth for its iPhone business following three straight quarters of declines. Facebook surged in extended trading after reporting better-than-expected earnings and a 53 percent jump in revenues from last year thanks to some very impressive user metrics. Yet both stocks were trading lower by mid-day Thursday. Related: Wall Street's Honeymoon With Trump Is Over Losses have hit other popular tech names, such as Microsoft (MSFT). Market breadth, or the percentage of stocks moving to the upside, continues to narrow precipitously. While stocks overall have flatlined since the middle of December, the percentage of NYSE stocks above their 50-day moving average has fallen from more than 83 percent to just 65 percent now. © Provided by The Fiscal Times Jason Goepfert at SentimenTrader warns that the island gap we've just witnessed — that is, a breakaway gap to a new high followed relatively quickly by a gap back down leaving unfilled space on stock charts — is widely viewed as a negative formation since it shows an "emotion shift between buyers and sellers." In other words, the euphoria from last week's long awaited close above the 20,000 level quickly gave way to an insatiable urge to book profits and sell. That's more than a little disappointing, given the way Wall Street and the financial media hyped Dow 20,000 for months. Looking back through market history since 1982, when the futures market was started, points to a negative performance bias: Six months later, stocks were on average 0.6 percent higher (vs. a 5.0 percent gain for any random six-month period) with a downside risk of 5.6 percent. Most notably, one of the prior occurrences was on October 8, 2007 which marked the death knell of the last bull market. Amid all this risk, Wall Street is simply unprepared for a downside scenario: At the end of December, according to Goepfert, mutual fund managers were maintaining their smallest cash allocation on record at just 3.0 percent of total assets. Translation: They are all in and unprepared for an overdue market correction. Anthony Mirhaydari is founder of the Edge and Edge Pro investment advisory newsletters.

"We welcome Apple's proposal to commence initial manufacturing operations in Karnataka. Its intentions to make iPhones in Bengaluru will foster the cutting-edge technology ecosystem and supply chain development in the state, which are critical for India to compete globally," said Kharge. "Apple's decision to make iPhones in Bengaluru has enhanced the city's reputation as the most preferred destination for foreign investment and validation of our policies to foster manufacturing, innovation and investments in the state," he said. The Silicon Valley-based global firm has been eyeing the India for a greater pie of its growing smartphones market, in which it sold 2.5 million iPhones as against a whopping 29 million by its Korean rival Samsung. Apple ships iPhones to India from Foxconn Technology firm in China and sells them through distributors and retailers, besides iStore and Imagine stores. Though the central government has told Apple that it would have to source 30 per cent of its components from Indian suppliers, Apple is seeking a 15-year tax holiday on import of components and equipment. With many states wooing Apple for its Indian plant in their cities, the iPhones maker has been exploring a best deal, including tax reliefs and exemptions from local sourcing.

Emily Fortuna / Twitter Share Share Tweet Share Comment Email Print advertisement Business is anything but usual for some of America's largest companies, as they question — or blatantly decry — President Trump's immigration ban. Google, Amazon, Starbucks, and Facebook are just a few of the big names to have stepped forward and denounce Trump's executive order, which restricts the entry of refugees and citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries, and indefinitely bans Syrian refugees altogether. In the latest scuffle, Apple CEO Tim Cook told the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday his company was considering taking legal action to have Trump's executive order reversed, noting that hundreds of Apple staff had been affected by the travel ban. "More than any country in the world, this country is strong because of our immigrant background and our capacity and ability as people to welcome people from all kinds of backgrounds," Cook told the WSJ. "That's what makes us special. We ought to pause and really think deeply through that." The following Fortune 500 companies have either publicly challenged or expressed concern over the order: Amazon Apple Citigroup Expedia Facebook Ford Goldman Sachs Alphabet Intel JPMorgan Chase MasterCard Microsoft Netflix Nike Procter & Gamble Salesforce Twitter, Square, Airbnb, Github, Etsy, Lyft, Uber, Tesla, and TripAdvisor have also protested the ban, as have pharmaceutical companies sych as Allergan and Perlara. Actions Speak Louder Than Words With so many firms lending their voice to the cause, it must be asked: Is each company genuinely invested in seeing the ban dissolved because of their values — or are some brands just riding the wave of a big marketing moment? The answer is multi-faceted: On one hand, any U.S. company speaking out against the president is taking a risk; on the other hand, it comes down to what actions these brands take beyond their statements. "A lot of people do approve the ban, so these companies are taking a risk just by taking a stance against it," said Margaret Wolfson, founder and creative director at River + Wolf. "But there seem to be three levels involved: The first is in making a statement that brands you as a compassionate believer in American values; the second is in employers looking out for their employees so they feel protected, and the third level — the hardest of all because of the logistics it entails — is going beyond the verbal to the visceral and investing time, energy, and money." Google, Starbucks, Lyft, and Airbnb, are among those companies putting their money where their values are, so to speak. Related: Silicon Valley Has Visceral Reaction to Trump's Ban "We're concerned about the impact of this order and any proposals that could impose restrictions on Googlers and their families, or that could create barriers to bringing great talent to the United States," a Google spokesperson told NBC News. "We'll continue to make our views on these issues known to leaders in Washington and elsewhere." To make its views not only known, but felt, Google created a $4 million crisis fund for those affected by the ban, pledging $2 million that can be matched by up to $2 million from employees to fund organizations such as the ACLU and the International Rescue Committee. Starbucks announced it was developing plans to hire 10,000 refugees over five years in the 75 countries around the world where Starbucks operates. A spokesperson for the company declined to comment, instead referring to chairman and CEO Howard Schultz's public letter to Starbucks partners. Lyft has pledged to donate $1 million to the ACLU over the next four years. A spokesperson for the company declined to comment beyond co-founder and CEO Logan Green's three tweets and Lyft's ACLU blog post. Soon after the ban was issued, Airbnb announced that it would provide free temporary housing to refugees and others impacted by the ban. "This initiative is a part of Airbnb's longstanding commitment to addressing the needs of refugees," said an Airbnb spokesperson, citing the company's past pledge to match up to $1 million donations to UNHCR. Also to be noted is Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos' assertion that Amazon is prepared to support a lawsuit against Trump and his administration over the order, while Twitter's Jack Dorsey released a short film about Syrian refugee and entrepreneur Yassin Tehrou. Thinking on a Global Level Companies campaigning against the ban may not only be looking to protect American values, but their global relationships as well. "A lot of organizations that have and will come out against [Trump's ban] are global firms that need support in other parts of the world," said Ronald Hill, a professor of marketing and business law at Villanova School of Business. "I wouldn't be surprised if global firms coming out against it do business in areas such as Western Europe that have high Muslim populations. You have to think from a global and not just a local perspective." Hill anticipates that more businesses will be chiming in against the ban, particularly those that have a history of prioritizing corporate social responsibility — despite the backlash they may receive. "Some fashion companies came out in support of people with AIDS relatively early on when there was still backlash against that," said Hill. "This is a continuation of that corporate social responsibility, but it's a new, unexplored avenue." How the Work Pays Off While companies embark upon this new avenue, organizations such as the ACLU are prospering more than ever. "Historically, the ACLU doesn't get much support from companies. We're often viewed as a thorn in the government's side because we challenge them on issues," Mark Wier, chief development officer at the ACLU, told NBC News. "But we are seeing some companies create formalized gifts, and hundreds of thousands of small businesses have offered to share proceeds of sales." From last Friday, when Trump issued the immigration ban, to the following Monday, Wier says that the ACLU raised a record $35 million. Related: Celebs and VIPs Donate to ACLU to Fight Trump "We've never seen that kind of outpouring so quickly," said Wier, adding that the ACLU will use the funding to hire over 100 employees including litigators, advocates, and communications specialists. "We need to power up the grid up we've already established with more force," said Wier. "Since the ACLU was able to get a stay on that executive order in federal district court, people are really seeing that it is possible to do something — and to actually win."

Brandão, a graphic designer, created a tantalizing concept video of the unreleased iPhone that rivals any commercial you'll see coming out of Cupertino. Thadeu Brandao iPhone 8 Concept From the looks of the video, which was spotted by BGR and created for ConceptsiPhone, Brandão drew upon many of the most popular iPhone 8 features that are rumored for Apple's next big release. Specifically, Brandão shows off an iPhone 8 with an edge-to-edge screen, which many rumor mongers think is a certainty for at least one model in this fall's release. MORE: Get Ready for iPhone 8 Ferrari: New Model Leaked Having the display stretch from one edge of the iPhone 8 to the other will require Apple to do something about the home button. Brandão has that covered by integrating the home button into the screen. It appears as a cutout in his concept video, but the display still washes over it. This being a concept video, there's a few ideas in here that aren't part of the iPhone 8 rumor mill, but really just interesting flights of fancy. For starters, Brandão incorporates the touch bar feature Apple added to last year's MacBook Pro update into his iPhone concept. Icons appear alongside the home button that change depending on which app is running. This edge-to-edge iPhone 8 concept has both front and rear screens. Credit: ConecptsiPhoneMore This edge-to-edge iPhone 8 concept has both front and rear screens. Credit: ConecptsiPhone Brandão's video also features an iPhone that has both front and rear displays, something we've seen in the YotaPhone, but not anything likely to appear in the iPhone 8 this fall. Still, we have to hand it to Brandão not just for dreaming big with his iPhone 8 concept video, but for making it looking as much like an Apple TV ad as possible, right down to the fonts. Our favorite touch? The "Hello Again" appearing at the end of the video, which long-time Apple fans will recognize as a play off the "Hello" message that greeted the world in the original iPhone commercial a decade ago.

According to the folks at Strategy Analytics, the number of shipments in the past quarter has decreased compared to the previous year. For example Apple’s shipments of iPads dropped from 16.1 million in Q4 2015 to 13.1 million in Q4 2016. Samsung has also seen a similar decline from 9 million to 8.1 million. Interestingly enough companies such as Amazon have actually seen an uptake on shipping from 3.5 million to 4.2 million, but overall it seems that the tablet market has declined by about 9%. So what does that mean for Apple’s iPad? The good news is that Apple appears to be soldiering on. According to Apple’s CEO Tim Cook, “We’ve got some exciting things coming on iPad and I’m optimistic about where things are headed. Customer satisfaction is through the roof. iPad Pro at 99%. So I see a lot of good things and hope for better results.” We’re not sure what “exciting things” he might be talking about, but last we heard there were rumors that Apple could have a new 10.5-inch iPad in the works, and that the next-gen Apple Pencil could come with magnets for easier storage, but either way we’ll have to wait and see for when the tablets are officially announced.

Picture taken October 3, 2016. REUTERS/Toru Hanai/Files TOKYO Sharp Corp lifted its full-year profit guidance after posting its first quarterly net profit in over two years as the Japanese liquid crystal display (LCD) maker pressed ahead with cost-cutting measures under the ownership of Taiwan's Foxconn. Sharp, a major supplier of LCD panels to Apple Inc, raised its operating profit forecast to 37.3 billion yen ($329.85 million) for the year ending in March from an earlier forecast of 25.7 billion, the company said in a statement on Friday. Net profit was 4.2 billion yen for October-December, compared with a 24.7 billion yen loss in the same period a year earlier. It was the first profit on a net basis since July-September 2014. The result missed a Thomson Reuters Starmine SmartEstimate of 4.6 billion yen drawn from four analysts. SmartEstimates give greater weight to recent forecasts by top-rated analysts. The return to profit comes as Sharp tapped Foxconn's massive parts procurement power, reviewed the lineup of products and implemented various measures to cut fixed costs. Sharp also benefited as production cutbacks by Korean rivals in LCD panels for television sets fuelled an industry-wide shortage of panels and pushed up market prices. Its core display device unit posted an operating profit of 11 billion yen, against a 11 billion yen loss a year prior, swinging back to profit for the first time in two years. Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, bought two-thirds of Sharp for around $3.7 billion in August.

While reports suggest that iPhone 8 will move to an all glass design, the concept dreamed up in iPhone 8 Commercial by Thadeu Brandão shows off a design similar to iPhone 7 Plus with the addition of some other rumored features. Other aspects of the creative render include a rounded metal frame (in contrast, previous rumors suggest more of an iPhone 4 style), versatile Home button, and a hat tip to the original iPhone with the volume buttons and side switch design seemingly influenced by the original device. The dynamic Home button visualizes functions similar to the Touch Bar on MacBook Pro. Another interesting aspect of this video are the transitions between the iPhone screens shown about halfway through the concept. It actually fooled me at first into thinking that there were two models being featured, one with ‘dual screens’ and the other with a single screen. But as readers pointed out in the comments, it’s really just one concept, with one screen (and tricky animation). In reality, it’s probably unlikely for Apple to implement a display that is functional to the absolute edge on all sides of the device this year. However, rumors do suggest it will bezel-less in some respects. Other features we may see first could be wireless charging and an embedded Touch ID sensor. But, what do you think, will Apple produce a display that is usable to every edge for iPhones in the years to come? Other reports detailing what we may more realistically see on the upcoming iPhone include a new facial recognition feature supported by a laser sensor, an enhanced Siri, inductive wireless charging (instead of long-range), and a larger OLED display. Further reports also include possibilities that the facial recognition or new biometric sensors will replace Touch ID and a flexible display with a new 3D Touch feature.

Cellebrite is the company the FBI turned to when Apple refused to create a backdoor for the agency to use on an iPhone. The FBI wanted Apple to create a version of iOS that would allow it to “brute force” the security code of an iPhone recovered in the investigation of the San Bernardino terrorist attack. Apple warned that creating a version of iOS with a back door would set a dangerous precedent and weaken the security of its devices.

Let's build on this progress by supporting vital next steps to expand bilateral commerce, including: - A Tax Treaty, eliminating the threat of double taxation of profits made by firms operating in both jurisdications. - A Millennium Challenge Corporation - MCC grant to fund Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math education in Armenia's schools. - Direct commercial and cargo flights from Los Angeles (LAX) to Yerevan (EVN). “The Contour investment is in the energy sector, namely the Vorotan hydo-power station. The Lydian investment is in mineral extraction, namely the Amsular mine. Both deserve careful official oversight and civil society scrutiny, particularly related to the long-term environmental and public health harms of mining,” reads the statement posted on the Committee’s official Facebook page.

Windows Is Becoming a Bigger Threat for Apple on Tablets GO iPads losing ground, while Windows tablets keep growing Feb 3, 2017 08:26 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  Windows is continuously improving its market share in the tablet business, with Microsoft’s operating system now getting very close to Apple, which loses ground every single quarter. A report from Strategy Analytics shows that in the fourth quarter of 2016, both Android and iOS lost market share points, while Windows was the only platform improving at a substantial rate. Specifically, Android remains the leading tablet platform with a share of 63 percent and 40.3 million devices, while iOS is the runner-up with 20.6 percent share and 13.1 million devices. Windows is third but not far behind iOS with 16 percent share and 10.1 million devices. Performance figures that compare Q4 2016 with the same quarter of the previous year show that both Android and iOS are declining, while Windows continues its growing trend, obviously pushed by Windows 10 and the updates that Microsoft released in the meantime. Apple, for example declined 19 percent, the research shows, while Android went down 10 percent. Windows, on the other hand, posted an increase of 19 percent during the same quarter. No new Surface models, but more devices from partners And this all happened during a year when Microsoft hasn’t released any new Surface models, which is living proof that the Windows ecosystem is growing and there’s a bigger number of partners adopting Windows on their tablets and 2-in-1 devices. “2-in-1 Tablets are a hot market segment but price remains a key factor in consumer behaviors around PC and Tablet replacement devices, which is evident in lower shipments of iPad Pro and Surface Pro 4 devices in the quarter,” Eric Smith, Senior Analyst, Tablet & Touchscreen Strategies service, says. “Apple cut prices on its iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 4 models but introduced no new iPad Pro models or pricing during the quarter, leading to 4% ASP decline year-on-year. Microsoft has not released a major refresh of its Surface Pro or Surface Book devices in over a year, which has given its OEM partners and other mobile-first companies a chance to catch up with high-performing, lower cost Surface clones.” Microsoft, on the other hand, is expected to refresh its Surface lineup as soon as this year, with the company likely to introduce the Surface Pro 5 and the Surface Book in the spring.

TECHNOLOGY Tech Giants Join Forces to Challenge Trump's Immigration Moves in Court The industry is leading the fight to roll back executive orders on travel from Muslim countries, sanctuary cities, and more. By Salvador Rodriguez Salvador Rodriguez is a staff reporter for the San Francisco bureau of Inc. He covers Apple, Google, Facebook, Twitter, tech diversity, virtual reality, and other aspects of technology and entrepreneurship. Previously, Rodriguez was the Silicon Valley correspondent for the International Business Times; before that, he was the lead tech blogger and gadget reviewer for the Los Angeles Times. Rodriguez has interned with The New York Times in Arizona, The Arizona Republic, and the Houston Chronicle. He was born in Mexico and raised in Texas, and he earned his journalism degrees at Arizona State University. One of his special skills is the ability to name all the Super Bowl winners chronologically from memory. @sal19 Staff reporter, Inc.@sal19 WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement Silicon Valley is putting muscle into its words by filing and preparing several lawsuits against President Donald Trump that challenge the constitutionality of his anti-immigration executive orders. After vocally and monetarily protesting Trump's orders, several tech companies are now banding together to mount a legal challenge. This makeshift coalition of companies is being organized by San Francisco startup Github, according to Reuters. Companies that have been invited to a Tuesday gathering include Google, Airbnb, and Netflix, the report said. The goal is to put together an amicus brief, otherwise known as a friend-of-the-court filing, to aid litigants. It's unclear which case or cases the brief would address, but on Tuesday, the city of San Francisco formerly filed a lawsuit against Trump claiming that his order threatening to take away federal funding from so-called Sanctuary Cities is in violation of the 10th Amendment. Sanctuary Cities are counties or cities that do not enforce federal immigration laws. For San Francisco, where there are hundreds or even thousands of startups that rely on foreign talent to build software and hardware, fighting for Sanctuary City status sends a sign to the world that immigrants are welcome, says Laura Gomez, CEO of Atipica, a Bay Area talent discovery startup. "Immigration is key to technology -- on one side, H-1B visa holders, and on the other, immigrants who serve those tech workers," says Gomez, who is from Mexico and originally arrived in the U.S. as an undocumented immigrant. "They may or may not be undocumented, but most certainly, they know someone who is." Up north in Washington, Amazon and Microsoft have also joined the fight. There, Attorney General Bob Ferguson has filed a lawsuit claiming Trump's Muslim ban is unconstitutional. That order has prevented refugees, travelers with visas, and dual citizens from seven Muslim countries from entering the United States. Amazon and Microsoft, as well as Expedia, will be providing Ferguson with information detailing their reliance on immigrant workers to aid in the lawsuit. "We're a nation of immigrants whose diverse backgrounds, ideas, and points of view have helped us build and invent as a nation for over 240 years," said Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos in a memo sent to his employees on Monday. "To our employees in the U.S. and around the world who may be directly affected by this order, I want you to know that the full extent of Amazon's resources are behind you."

By Larry Dignan for Between the Lines | January 31, 2017 -- 20:32 GMT (12:32 PST) | Topic: Developer Google said it will move its Chrome for iOS code into the open source community and may have gotten a few digs into Apple while it was at it. special feature Securing Your Mobile Enterprise Mobile devices continue their march toward becoming powerful productivity machines. But they are also major security risks if they aren't managed properly. We look at the latest wisdom and best practices for securing the mobile workforce. Read More In a blog post, Google noted that Chrome iOS "was kept separate from the rest of the Chromium project due to the additional complexity required for the platform." Now Google is moving it into the Chromium project's open source repository. Google noted that to move the code it needed to do "careful refactoring." Specifically, Google said Chrome on iOS had to support WebKit's rendering engine as well as Blink, a engine supported by Chrome for other platforms. TechRepublic: Apple iPhone 7 is being hardened to handle military-grade secrets Google said development speed will be faster for tests of Chrome on iOS. Reading the blog post, I couldn't help but notice that Google mentioned complexity and constraints when referring to Apple iOS. The subtle phrasing obviously is rooted in Google's contention that its Android platform is better for developers. In any case, Google had two variations of the word complex and one mention of constraints in the first 97 words of a blog post.

Last year, when Apple refused to unlock the security on an iPhone 5c belonging to the San Bernardino shooter, the FBI turned to an Israeli mobile forensics firm called Cellebrite to find another way into the encrypted iPhone. Now Motherboard reports that a hacker has released files allegedly from Cellebrite that demonstrate how cracking tools couldn't be kept private. From a report: Now the hacker responsible has publicly released a cache of files allegedly stolen from Cellebrite relating to Android and BlackBerry devices, and older iPhones, some of which may have been copied from publicly available phone cracking tools." The ripped, decrypted and fully functioning Python script set to utilize the exploits is also included within," the hacker wrote in a README file accompanying the data dump. The hacker posted links to the data on Pastebin. It's not clear when any of this code was used in the UFED. Many of the directory names start with "ufed" followed by a different type of phone, such as BlackBerry or Samsung. In their README, the hacker notes much of the iOS-related code is very similar to that used in the jailbreaking scene -- a community of iPhone hackers that typically breaks into iOS devices and release its code publicly for free. apple security exploit ← You may like to read: → Mexican Surgeon Uses VR Headset To Distract Patients During Surgery Apple Cites 'Courage' As Reason To Remove 3.5mm Headphone Jack China Threatens To Cut Sales of iPhones and US Cars if 'Naive' Trump Pursues Trade War Company Creates Gun That Looks Like a Cellphone Phil Schiller Says the MacBook Pro Doesn't Need an SD Card Slot DOJ Threatens To Seize iOS Source Code This is the most recent story.

Apple sold 78.29 million iPhones in the first quarter ended Dec. 31, up from 74.78 million last year, marking the first quarterly growth in iPhone sales in a year. Analysts on average had estimated iPhone sales of 77.42 million, according to research firm FactSet StreetAccount. The results, which reflected the first full quarter of iPhone 7 sales, come at a time when global demand for smartphones is slowing and cheaper Android alternatives are flooding the market. Apple's services business, which includes the App Store, Apple Pay and iCloud, recorded an 18.4 percent growth in revenue, helped by the popularity of games such as Pokemon Go and Super Mario Run and higher revenue from subscriptions.

Unsurprisingly, the latter case seems to be prevailing because it is expected that a mobile phone consumer who has used more than two mobile phones in his lifetime is likely to have used devices from at least two different mobile phone manufacturers. Accordingly, the report effectively captured the SoVs of 18 different mobile brands operating across different markets of the world. [d] From the report, Samsung generated the highest conversations month-on-month over the competition. The mobile giant’s impressive online engagement figures may be attributed to the launch of its Samsung Galaxy A and Galaxy J Series at different intervals across different markets of the world in Q2 2016 bolstered also by the release of its flagship Samsung S7 March the same year (visit Teksight Edge’s official blog to access free version of the full report). Tecno, according to the report launched Tecno Boom J8 and Camon C9 within this same interval in the local market. However, on the global scene, Samsung and Apple enjoyed much stronger aspirational value. Interestingly, while the top mobile brands narrowly edged out Africa’s No. 1 mobile brand Tecno, in the share of voice (SOV), the chart revealed the Chinese mobile phone maker rising profile and clever positioning on the international scene. The online media analysis conducted by Teksight Eedge for this report covered major mobile markets in Africa and the world including Nigeria, Kenya, China, Europe, America, South Africa, Russia, France, Germany, Japan and Korea. Consequently, a look at a chart showing media impression of some mobile brands in Nigeria revealed Tecno as commanding 40% of market’s SoV; surpassing Samsung which is second on the chart. Meanwhile, Tecno, according to the report is estimated to have about 25.3% mobile phone market share across six of Africa’s biggest mobile phone markets that are, Kenya, Nigeria, Tanzania, Egypt, Ethiopia and Cameroon. The Launch of Tecno’s Phantom 6 & 6 plus as well as Apple’s iPhone 7 & 7 plus in September 2016 however significantly changed SOV results in the 4th quarter. For Tecno, the international launch of its flagship Phantom 6 & Phantom 6 Plus at Burj Khalifa Dubai increased the brand’s global competitiveness and value. For obvious reasons, the mobile phone market is a survival of the fittest so brands will either have to continually innovate or gradually fade. Which mobile brand will boast of having the highest engagement figures at the end of fourth quarter 2016? Well, we might just have to wait and see.

It is nothing but a process of clearing toxins from the colon. When you don't clear clogged pipes in your home's drainage system, what happens? Dirt accumulates and leaves a foul odour, right? Bacteria may also breed and you might see worms moving around. In the same way, your intestines may need some attention occasionally. Toxic buildup can make you sick. Of course, your body regularly takes care of eliminating the toxins. Colon cleansing is not totally accepted by some scientific communities. But still, you can always try it after consulting your doctor. Also Read: Lemon, Ginger And Apple For Colon Cleanse But don't buy colon cleansing products sold in the market. Try simple and harmless home remedies like drinking lemon juice or apple juice or ginger water in the morning. Also, try juice fasting for a day. Now, here are some signs you may need colon cleansing. Sign #1 Even after sleeping for 8 hours, do you wake up feeling tired? Do you feel sluggish even when you are sleeping enough? Then maybe a colon cleanse might help you. Sign #2 In spite of all the skin care routines you follow, does it look pale? Do you see spots on skin or pimples? Well, a colon cleanse may also brighten your skin. Also Read: A Mixture To Cleanse Your Colon Sign #3 Are your bowels watery all the time? Are your bowel movements irregular? A colon cleanse can help your bowel movements too. Sign #4 You eat very little but still you are unable to lose weight. Is that the case? Then a colon cleanse might help. Also Read: What Happens If You Drink Cabbage Juice? Sign #5 Even after bathing well and washing your body thoroughly, do you smell bad? A colon cleanse may clear the problem. Sign #6 Even though you brush your teeth regularly and use mouth fresheners, is your mouth stinking? Well, a colon cleanse could help.

Edwin Chan Apple Inc. CEO Tim Cook. Photo: Reuters Hong Kong: Apple Inc. is considering taking legal action against an executive order signed by US President Donald Trump that halted entry by persons from seven predominantly Muslim countries, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing chief executive officer Tim Cook as saying. America’s largest corporation will continue to press the White House to reverse the order, Cook told the newspaper in an interview after decrying Trump’s move over the weekend in an internal memo. He joins other high-profile Silicon Valley executives including Alphabet Inc.’s Sergey Brin in protesting the order, which threatens to stem the flow of immigrant talent the industry relies on. Cook didn’t elaborate on his legal options in the interview, saying only “we want to be constructive and productive.” Apple representatives didn’t respond to phone calls seeking comment after normal business hours. Also Read: Apple sales beat estimates on demand for latest iPhones “More than any country in the world, this country is strong because of our immigrant background and our capacity and ability as people to welcome people from all kinds of backgrounds. That’s what makes us special,” Cook told the Journal. “We ought to pause and really think deeply through that.” Trump’s order prevents people from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from entering the US for the next three months, a move the White House says is needed to safeguard the country from terrorist acts. But emotions are running high in the tech industry because that executive order violates Silicon Valley’s self-image of inclusion and tolerance. At least half of the top 20 US tech companies were founded or are currently led by someone who came from another country. Apple co-founder Steve Jobs was himself the son of a Syrian immigrant, while the CEOs of Microsoft Corp. and Google were born in India. The industry also relies on foreigners to make up for the dearth of home-grown engineering talent needed to write advanced software and build complex machines. Many of the core tasks at Silicon Valley companies are handled by immigrants. Cook said he’d received numerous emails from employees with “heart-wrenching stories” about the potential fallout from Trump’s executive decision, which could extend to hundreds of Apple’s workers. “These are people that have friends and family. They’re co-workers. They’re taxpayers. They’re key parts of the community,” Cook told the Journal.

The firm defines tablets as either a “slate”, like the iPad, or a “detachable” that offers a first-party keyboard like a Microsoft Surface device. The firm's totted up all the sums from a year's worth of its Worldwide Quarterly Tablet Tracker and the results are ugly: total sales sinking 15.6 per cent, year on year, with sales of 174.8m units in 2016 compared to 2015's 207.2m. Only Amazon and Huawei were immune from the slump, while Lenovo stayed just about steady. Apple sales fell 14.2 per cent and Samsung was down 20.2 per cent. Even Christmas couldn't excite buyers, with sales down 20.1 per cent for the fourth quarter. Here's IDC's numbers for Q4 2016.

But even that market isn't red-hot, IDC says, citing a stale crop of products from Microsoft and Apple as a purchase-crimping problem. “For every 10 slate tablets shipped, Apple only sold 1 iPad Pro tablet,” the form says. There are some bright spots. Huawei's growing thanks to its emphasis on built-in cellular connectivity and is yet to make a serious pass at the US market. Lenovo makes striking kit that IDC says makes it the one to watch in 2017. Amazon's discounted its tablets to win more Prime subscribers but IDC thinks it won't care too much about sales of its Fire devices, as the device customers use to access Prime doesn't overly bother the company. Here's IDC's numbers for all of 2016. Top Five Tablet Vendors, Shipments, Market Share, and Growth, 2016 (Preliminary Results, Shipments in millions) Vendor 2016 Unit Shipments 2016 Market Share 2015 Unit Shipments 2015 Market Share Year-Over-Year Growth 1.

Perhaps they will in 2017 as new devices emerge and businesses recognise the inevitability of Windows 10 upgrades and start looking for new kit. ® Tips and corrections 6 Comments More from The Register HPE is creaming Dell in HPC Servers you right, says shrinker to bulked up big boy 3 Comments Intel-supported Open HPC stack to land in Q4 Shrink-wrapped software stack for big ironmongers 2 Comments IDC shock prediction: Someone might build Skynet in next few years Tech's Mystic Megs also say robotics market will expand.

 Tech giants take on each other in the smart home BI Intelligence Jan. 30, 2017, 10:45 AM 2,330 facebook linkedin twitter email print BI Intelligence See Also Many people still see smart home voice assistants as a novelty The Internet of Everything — $12.6 trillion ROI expected over the next decade [SLIDE DECK] Here's what the hire of Dropcam’s founder means for Apple This story was delivered to BI Intelligence IoT Briefing subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. Over the past year, the world’s largest tech companies’ smart home ecosystems have taken shape, and the market strategies for the three largest of these companies is now clear. However, as Reuters notes, this will set the companies on a collision course with each other as the smart home matures and becomes a more mainstream consumer service. Apple’s HomeKit is centered on sales of the iPhone, the remote of the HomeKit ecosystem. While the entire ecosystem is built around Apple products, with the Apple TV or iPad serving as the hub for the HomeKit ecosystem, the iPhone is the only prerequisite for a user to set up an Apple Home ecosystem. Users can still operate the ecosystem without an Apple TV or iPad, albeit only from inside the home rather than remotely. This helps the company because each iPhone user with iOS 10 has the ability to set up HomeKit devices and use Apple products to adopt the smart home. The Google Home is centered on targeting users with ads. The company is one of the largest in the world to rely on ads as its primary stream of revenue, announcing a whopping $79.4 billion from its AdSense division on its earnings call last week, the overwhelming majority of the Alphabet parent’s total revenue. While Alphabet bought the device makers Nest and Dropcam in recent years, it doesn't have the built-in user base that Apple has with iPhone. It may boast a technological advantage in the Google Assistant, however, over Alexa and Siri at this point, as Sundar Pichai argued on the company’s earnings call. Amazon’s Echo products are designed to be an access point to the Prime network. As BI Intelligence has previously identified, the online retailer’s monetization strategy doesn't focus on the hardware of the Echo devices, but rather on connecting users directly to the Prime network without having to go through an iPhone or Google search engine to do so. This creates a recurring revenue stream for the online retailer. As Alexa’s reach continues to expand, it will become an even larger monetization asset for Amazon by allowing more points of entry into the Prime network. But Apple may fall behind Google and Amazon due to its heavy reliance on iPhone sales to monetize the smart home. As previously noted, Apple is only one of the three companies listed above to rely on hardware to drive revenue in the smart home space. Amazon and Google will continue to be able to monetize the smart home even if the sales of their hardware decline, which is especially relevant given the recent trend of iPhone sales stagnation. But with a new tenth-anniversary iPhone on the horizon this year, the company might be able to overcome this at least temporarily. Further, despite that the company might not be able to get more people to buy iPhones and set up HomeKit, it still has a massive iPhone user base that works to its advantage. The U.S. smart home market has yet to truly take off. At its current state, we believe the smart home market is stuck in the 'chasm' of the technology adoption curve, in which it is struggling to surpass the early-adopter phase and move to the mass-market phase of adoption. There are many barriers preventing mass-market smart home adoption: high device prices, limited consumer demand and long device replacement cycles. However, the largest barrier is the technological fragmentation of the smart home ecosystem, in which consumers need multiple networking devices, apps and more to build and run their smart home. John Greenough, senior research analyst for BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on the U.S. smart home market that analyzes current consumer demand for the smart home and barriers to widespread adoption. It also analyzes and determines areas of growth and ways to overcome barriers. Here are some key takeaways from the report: Smart home devices are becoming more prevalent throughout the US. We define a smart home device as any stand-alone object found in the home that is connected to the internet, can be either monitored or controlled from a remote location, and has a noncomputing primary function. Multiple smart home devices within a single home form the basis of a smart home ecosystem. Currently, the US smart home market as a whole is in the "chasm" of the tech adoption curve. The chasm is the crucial stage between the early-adopter phase and the mass-market phase, in which manufacturers need to prove a need for their devices. High prices, coupled with limited consumer demand and long device replacement cycles, are three of the four top barriers preventing the smart home market from moving from the early-adopter stage to the mass-market stage. For example, mass-market consumers will likely wait until their device is broken to replace it. Then they will compare a nonconnected and connected product to see if the benefits make up for the price differential. The largest barrier is technological fragmentation within the connected home ecosystem. Currently, there are many networks, standards, and devices being used to connect the smart home, creating interoperability problems and making it confusing for the consumer to set up and control multiple devices. Until interoperability is solved, consumers will have difficulty choosing smart home devices and systems. "Closed ecosystems" are the short-term solution to technological fragmentation. Closed ecosystems are composed of devices that are compatible with each other and which can be controlled through a single point. In full, the report: Analyzes the demand of US consumers, based off of survey results Forecasts out smart home device growth until 2020 Determines the current leaders in the market Explains how the connected home ecosystem works Examines how Apple and Google will play a major role in the development of the smart home Some of the companies mentioned in this report include Apple, Google, Nest, August, ADT, Comcast, AT&T, Time Warner Cable, Lowe's, and Honeywell.

Club MacStoriesWeekly Extras MENU ABOUT CONTACT NEWSLETTER ADVERTISE SECTIONS APP REVIEWS LINKED STORIES iOS 10 WWDC 2016 Evernote 8: A Review and Comparison with Apple Notes Linea: An Elegant Sketching App for the iPad from The Iconfactory AirPods: Ushering in a Wireless Future Balance Brings Financial Accounts to the Mac’s Menu Bar By John Voorhees Balance is a macOS menu bar app that tracks the balances and transactions in your bank, investment, and online financial accounts. The app supports thousands of financial institutions and takes advantage of some of Apple’s latest innovations on the Mac like the Touch Bar and Touch ID. If you want immediate access to balance and transaction data across multiple accounts at your fingertips, Balance is worth a look. To add an account to Balance, click one of the major financial institutions listed in the drop-down window when you click on the menu bar icon, or search for another from the search box at the top of the window. When adding your login credentials for a financial institution, there is a helpful 1Password button that kicks off a search for any related passwords you have saved. Unfortunately, it only uses the first word in the name of the institution you pick so clicking the 1Password icon for ‘Bank of New York’ will only search 1Password for ‘Bank,’ which could return multiple results depending on your 1Password database. At the bottom of the login screen is a button with a disclosure arrow that expands the window to reveal an explanation of the security used by Balance. According to the description in the app, Balance uses a service called Plaid.com. Your banking login credentials are not sent to Balance. They are transmitted by SSL to Plaid, which provides a read-only copy of transactions to Balance. Plaid has direct relationships with financial institutions and is used by companies like PayPal, Venmo, and Stripe. I took a look at Plaid.com before entering my banking login credentials into Balance and got comfortable with the security involved, but I encourage you to do the same before trying Balance because everyone’s tolerance for risk is different. I logged into an investment account, which has sub-accounts, a checking account, a credit card account, and a PayPal account. Balance immediately downloaded transaction data for each account without a hitch. Balance is divided into four tabs across the top of the window: Accounts, Transactions, Notifications, and Insights. Accounts lists each account by financial institution with a total balance at the bottom of the window. Clicking on an account lets you search for transactions related to just that account in the Transactions tab. Transactions is a chronological list of every transaction for the accounts tracked. In one long chronological list I was able to see deposits and transfers in and out of my PayPal account, charges to my credit card, and everything else that had occurred in my accounts. At the top of the window is a search bar, which makes finding a particular transaction fast. Searches accept special tokens like ‘under:500’ for transactions under $500 or ‘category:services’ for transactions labeled as services-related. Through trial and error I discovered that the following search tokens work: account: category: over: under: in:[account name] or account:[account name] before:[MM/DD/YYYY] or [YYYY/MM/DD] after: [MM/DD/YYYY] or [YYYY/MM/DD] It is my understanding that a filter system that makes these search tokens more discoverable should be released soon as part of an update to Balance. Transactions and accounts can also be navigated with the Touch Bar if your Mac has one. Notifications lets you set up rules that will send you an alert when actions occur. For instance, you can set up rules to notify you when a transaction occurs that is over a certain amount or is labeled with a particular category. Insights has two ways to filter transactions. You can view transactions with new merchants or all transactions by merchant. If you add multiple credit and debit cards, Insights will give you a better idea where you are spending the most and new vendors you have frequented even if the charges are spread across multiple credit or debit card. One thing that I’d like to see added to Balance is an option to break the window away from the menu bar like Fantastical for Mac does. That would make it possible to use Balance side-by-side with a spreadsheet or other app. The trouble with being strictly a menu bar app is that Balance’s window disappears every time you switch to another app. Balance is a good solution if you want to frequently check your account balances and transactions because it’s always at your fingertips in the menu bar and up-to-date thanks to background updates. Balance may also work well for small business owners who need to keep tabs on the use of company credit cards by multiple people. By using Plaid as an intermediary with financial institutions, Balance brings together disparate sources of data into one unified, well-designed, secure, and organized view that saves you the time of checking the websites of multiple institutions. Balance is a free download on the Mac App Store with In-App Purchases of subscriptions that are priced based on the number of accounts you want to track. Five accounts cost $4.99 per month or $49.99 per year; ten accounts is $9.99 per month or $99.99 per year; and twenty accounts is $19.99 per month or $199.99 per year.

The move could put pressure on other CEOs expected to attend a meeting with Trump on Friday. (Reporting By Heather Somerville, writing Peter Henderson; Editing by David Gregorio) Wochit Business How does Snapchat make money? Feb.02 -- Snapchat parent company Snap just unveiled its IPO prospectus, setting the stage for one of the largest tech debut in years. Much of how Snap operates has been shrouded in secrecy since co-founders Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy first launched the Snapchat app in 2011. What is clear is that the app is most popular with young people, which means the investor community isn’t necessarily using the app -- and has often been confused about what it does and how it makes money. Bloomberg IPO reporter Alex Barinka and Bloomberg Technology reporter Sarah Frier give a tutorial on the app and show how Snap has pivoted into other offerings, like its Spectacles glasses.

But today its control seems here to stay—as does big cable’s control over how you consume the programming you pay for. Quotes in the article Comcast Corp CMCSA ▼ 75.09 -0.52 -0.69% Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 128.53 -0.22 -0.17% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▲ 839.95 +7.60 +0.91% AT&T Inc T ▼ 41.18 -0.88 -2.09% This week, the Federal Communications Commission met for the first time under its new chairman, Ajit Pai, a Republican. The original agenda for the meeting included consideration of the agency’s latest proposal—advanced under former Democratic chairman Tom Wheeler—to force cable companies to make their services a bit more open. That item disappeared from the agenda—and with it the likelihood that much of anything will change in the world of cable, at least as far as government regulation is concerned. Related: Trump’s FCC Pick Doesn’t Bode Well For Net Neutrality At the dawn of the Obama administration, the future of cable looked a lot different, and not because government regulators were going to force the industry to change. Comcast announced a tech standard called Tru2Way at the 2008 Consumer Electronics Show that would have made it possible for any company to build a cable box that tapped into Comcast’s television service. The idea was that instead of renting a cable box from Comcast, you could pick from a wide range of different devices. You’d still need to pay for your cable subscription, but you could use your Apple TV or Roku instead of renting a cable box, or maybe just plug your TV right into the wall without worrying about any box at all. “The age of the closed, proprietary cable box is behind us,” Comcast CEO Brian Roberts said at the event. Had the idea ever taken off, cable box rental fees would have disappeared, and third parties could have competed to create the best cable-viewing experience. Don’t like your pay TV provider’s labyrinth of menus? Maybe the Apple TV’s interface would be more to your liking. Or perhaps you would have been able to use gadgets like the Amazon Echo or Google Home. But Tru2Way never went anywhere. Neither did the bigger idea of opening up cable until last year, when the FCC proposed rules that would have required pay TV companies to open their video streams to third parties through an open standard. The proposal was not unlike what Comcast pledged to do back in 2008. It was also a long time coming: Congress first asked the FCC to promote competition in the cable equipment business back in 1996, and would have replaced the outdated and cumbersome CableCard standard. The cable industry pushed back, arguing that the proposed system was technically unfeasible and would have enabled people to pirate content more easily, as well as allow those third parties companies to insert their own ads into shows. The FCC listened and came back with a watered-down proposal that would have required companies to simply provide apps for all major platforms—think Amazon Video on your Comcast box—and make their content searchable. The industry balked at this idea as well. Now it looks like the whole endeavor has been postponed, more than two decades after congress first asked FCC to look into the issue. More: AT&T Undercuts Cable TV With $35 Internet Streaming Service Still, the question remains: Why didn’t the industry make these changes voluntarily? After all, the ability to watch what you want where you want on any device you want is the basic promise of internet-powered television in the 21st century.© Comcast Comcast Keeping the Cord The most obvious answer is money. According to the FCC, consumers collectively spend around $19.5 billion a year on cable box rental fees. That’s almost pure profit for the industry because customers pay for the cost of the box several times over. But Comcast was apparently happy to part with that revenue a few years ago when it proposed Tru2Way. So what’s changed? Why has Comcast gone from promising to kill the proprietary cable box to prolonging its existence? The rise of video streaming services is likely key. “If [cable companies] relegate their user experience to just another app on a third-party box like a Roku, they’re on par with all the other forms of entertainment that compete for user attention,” says telecommunications industry analyst Jan Dawson. Without an open standard, third parties have to work out deals with companies like Charter and Comcast in order to carry their apps. That gives the cable giants quite a bit of control over what you can watch and where. If Comcast doesn’t want to make an app for the Apple TV, then you’re out of luck. It’s not all bad news for those who want to watch TV somewhere other than their TV sets. Streaming services like Dish’s Sling TV and AT&T’s DirecTV let you watch live programming over the internet on smartphones, tablets, and computers. And this week Comcast launched a beta version of an app that lets you watch live TV on Roku devices. Charter/Time-Warner Cable have a Roku app as well. But Charter’s Roku app doesn’t include on-demand programming or the ability to record any content. And Comcast’s beta app still requires a cable box, at least until the final version is released. In the meantime, Comcast is also working on improving the cable box itself to avoid becoming just another app. The company launched its voice-controlled remote in 2015, and last year Bloomberg reported that Comcast was working on a more Alexa-like version that doesn’t require you to carry around the remote like a microphone. Comcast is also in the process of integrated its system with a range of smart home devices, including lights, smart locks, the Nest thermostat, and its own home security service. In other words, Comcast is trying to build a smart home platform with TV at the center. A platform that, as it happens, will also encourage bundling of multiple Comcast services. That aspiration puts it in competition with Amazon, Apple, Google, and many other companies battling to control the living room via voice-activated hardware. Control over TV is Comcast’s edge in this battle. If its box is the only way you can search and control your cable with your voice and you can control everything else in your home with it too, you have less incentive to use a competing product. And thanks to the FCC’s apparently new direction, Comcast’s cable box is likely to remain the only cable box its customers in Comcast markets will be able to use for the foreseeable future. The risk for Comcast is that customers might opt to cut the cord entirely and just watch streaming video, especially if competing services are cheaper and provide a better experience. But Comcast has another edge: data limits. If the cost of streaming services plus data overages ends up being more than a cable subscription, Comcast could encourage people to stick to cable. The FCC’s net neutrality rules give the agency the ability to step in if it deems Comcast’s actions as anti-competitive. But those rules are in Republicans’ crosshairs. Under the new administration, Comcast’s control appears assured. You, on the other hand, are stuck with the same remote.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 3 February 2017 | MYT 12:25 PM Apple moves closer to iPhone assembly in India Made in India?: A source said if Apple did go ahead with plans to begin assembling the iPhone in India, it was likely to do so initially at a plant being set up by its Taiwanese manufacturing partner Wistron Corp at Peenya on the outskirts of the tech hub of Bengaluru, Karnataka. — Reuters MUMBAI: The government of the Indian state of Karnataka said on Feb 2 it welcomed a proposal from Apple Inc to begin initial manufacturing operations in the state, in a sign the tech company is slowly moving forward with plans to assemble iPhones in the country.  "Apple's intentions to manufacture in Bengaluru will foster cutting edge technology eco system and supply chain development in the state, which are critical for India to compete globally," the government of the south Indian state said in a statement.  A source familiar with the matter told Reuters, however, that no deal, or memorandum of understanding had so far been finalised with the Karnataka government.  The person, who asked not to be named, said if Apple did go ahead with plans to begin assembling the iPhone, it was likely to do so initially at a plant being set up by its Taiwanese manufacturing partner Wistron Corp at Peenya on the outskirts of the tech hub of Bengaluru, Karnataka.  Apple was not immediately reachable for comment.  Cupertino, California-based Apple, is keen to assemble its phones in India, one of the world's fastest growing smartphone markets.  Apple representatives met with federal and state government officials in India last week, as it is lobbying hard for a raft of tax and sourcing concessions from India, before it begins to assemble iPhones in the country.  Following the meetings, Apple said it appreciated the open and constructive dialogue it held with Indian officials, around the expansion of its local operations in the country.  Any final decision around manufacturing in India however, is likely to still be contingent on the government's willingness to concede ground on the concessions sought by the company.  Last month, Information Technology Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said India would consider Apple's request for incentives to invest in the country with an "open mind."  On its part, the government of Karnataka said on Thursday it was "committed to new initiatives in any sector for manufacturing and will provide a conducive environment for investment." — Reuters Tags / Keywords: Foreign News , Corporate News , Analyst Reports , Life & Style , Technology You May Be Interested Amazon profit jumps while revenue misses mark New web entertainment services have us spying on ourselves Credit card thieves move online as chips cut in-store fraud Mobile gaming is box office business Snap shoots for the sky, promises little in US$3bil IPO pitch Can BikerNext bring romance to riders?

The release did not detail about what the initial manufacturing operations would be. However, reports quoting highly placed government sources had earlier said that the iconic iPhones would be manufactured in Bengaluru by Wistron, a Taiwanese OEM maker for Apple. “Wistron has plans for setting up iPhone manufacturing plant for domestic market in Peenya,” they had said. Apple’s decision on initial manufacturing in Bengaluru has further enhanced the city’s reputation as the most preferred destination for foreign investment and further validation of State Government policies aimed at fostering manufacturing, innovation and investments in Karnataka, the release added. Local manufacturing is expected to help Apple price its phones more competitively in India as it currently attracts 12.5% additional duty on imports. This would be Apple’s second big project for Bengaluru. In May, Apple had announced setting up a design and development accelerator in the city to grow the iOS developer community. The announcement was made as part of the visit of Apple CEO Tim Cook to India.

The hearing aid is able to connect to an iPhone. (AP photo/John Locher) Click here to enlarge image Hearing aids may soon be sold over the counter By Judith Graham / Kaiser Health News Published Feb 2, 2017 at 02:02PM Imagine senior citizens walking around with stylish ear devices that amplify and clarify sound and connect wirelessly to smartphones, tablets, televisions and digital assistants such as Amazon’s Alexa or Apple’s Siri. Technology is already moving in this direction, and companies such as Samsung, Bose and Panasonic are reportedly readying new products of this kind. They would be sold over the counter to customers who could test their own hearing with cellphone apps or online programs and adjust sound parameters themselves. The devices “will be widely used by older people,” just as ear buds are used by younger people today, predicted Richard Einhorn, a well-known composer who serves on the board of the Hearing Loss Association of America, a consumer group. Recognizing market forces, the Food and Drug Administration is mobilizing. In December, the agency said it planned to take “steps necessary to propose to modify our regulations to create a category of (over-the-counter) hearing aids.” Early in January, the Federal Trade Commission announced plans for a meeting on hearing health care in April. That agency played an important role in ensuring that consumers get copies of eyeglass prescriptions that allow them to shop around for good deals. For the most part, that doesn’t happen with hearing aids today. Whether agency priorities will change under the new Trump administration isn’t certain. But technology is developing rapidly. Older adults with mild to moderate hearing loss are expected to be a prime market for new products marrying hearing aids with consumer electronics. More than 40 percent of people older than 60 have some hearing loss, mostly mild to moderate; that figure rises to 80 percent of people older than 80. Yet only 20 percent of those with an impairment use hearing aids — because of their high cost (an average $4,700 per pair), a lack of insurance coverage (traditional Medicare, for example, doesn’t pay for them), stigma, denial and difficulties getting the appropriate care. Hoping to expand access, the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology came out in favor of low-cost, over-the-counter hearing devices in 2015. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine seconded that recommendation in a major report on hearing health care published in June. Both organizations cite a growing body of research linking hearing loss to cognitive decline, depression, the onset of dementia, falls, poor physical functioning and social isolation. The longer people delay seeking help, research suggests, the more at risk they become. Several recent developments are of note as consumer electronics companies, hearing-aid manufacturers, audiologists, physicians, consumer advocates and regulators prepare for a surge of new devices and changes in the health care system that deals with hearing: Removing barriers For 40 years, the FDA has required that adults be examined by a doctor before purchasing a hearing aid or sign a waiver noting that they didn’t want to take this step. In December, the agency eliminated that requirement. The National Academies of Sciences’ expert panel on hearing health had noted that the rule “provides no clinically meaningful benefit” and could discourage people from seeking care. Rather than see a physician, people buying hearing aids signed the waiver 60 to 95 percent of the time. Still, limits on access to hearing aids exist: All states restrict distribution of these devices to certified audiologists, physicians and device specialists. And some states still require medical evaluations. Proposed legislation Sens. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said recently that they would soon introduce legislation endorsing the sale of hearing aids without such restrictions. The goal is to increase competition, lower costs and expand access to devices for people with mild to moderate hearing loss, Grassley said in a statement. Six companies control nearly 98 percent of the hearing aid market in the United States. Nearly two-thirds of people with severe hearing loss report being unable to afford the devices, whose cost is generally bundled with professional fees for evaluation, fitting and follow-up care. Organizations representing hearing professionals are deeply divided. The American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, an organization representing audiologists and speech-language pathologists, said it doesn’t believe consumers can adequately self-diagnose hearing problems and opposes over-the-counter devices. Ian Windmill, president of the American Academy of Audiology, said his group is taking a “wait-and-see stance” until the FDA acts. But he added that his group, which represents more than 12,000 audiologists, believes that professionals should evaluate hearing loss. Another group, the Academy of Doctors of Audiology, said it believes the benefits of expanding access to hearing devices outweigh the risks; it supports over-the-counter products. The senators plan to introduce their legislation, which asks the FDA to issue regulations ensuring the safety and effectiveness of these devices, in this new congressional session. Creating standards One area of considerable confusion is the difference between hearing aids and personal sound amplification products, or PSAPs. This is a wide category of products, ranging from cheap items that help amplify sound to sophisticated devices that resemble hearing aids in all but name. In some cases, companies are marketing the same device as a hearing aid and a PSAP, but at different prices. In 2009, the FDA drew a distinction between PSAPs and hearing aids based on what the agency called their “intended use.” PSAPs were considered unregulated consumer electronics products for people with normal hearing who wanted to hear more sharply — for instance, during birdwatching. Hearing aids were regulated and considered medical devices meant for people with hearing impairment. But technological advances have brought the two categories closer. And it’s well understood that people with hearing loss are using PSAPs as a cheaper alternative to hearing aids. Stephanie Czuhajewski, executive director of the Academy of Doctors of Audiology, said she believes higher-end PSAPs will become over-the-counter hearing aids. In the meantime, the Consumer Technology Association has prepared standards for PSAPs meant to make it easier for people to understand what they’re buying. The standards, which address issues such as maximum output, peak output and sound distortion may be published as early as next month. “The intent is to provide a ‘Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval’ for PSAPs,” said Mead Killion, an audiologist who founded Etymotic Research, an Illinois company that manufactures hearing devices. Currently, there is no easy, standardized way to compare these devices. 16328018 View next article in Health     Get Central Oregon's top headlines delivered to your inbox every morning GO print version Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus This image is copyrighted.

Having sidled up to King Donald in New York City before he took over as US president, tech CEOs have stayed mostly quiet during two of the most tumultuous weeks in recent US political history. To be fair, a few top execs posted carefully worded statements on their websites while citizens protested against Trump's crackdown on Muslim immigrants. Thanks for your opinions, powerful rich people. However, now that the White House is planning to shake up the H-1B visa program, which tech companies are heavily reliant on to get skilled-slash-cheaper workers into the country, funnily enough we're seeing a slightly more vigorous response. A draft of a letter, addressed to President Trump, that is making the rounds among tech giants on America's West Coast makes some brief allusions to American values before getting down to business: "As entrepreneurs and business leaders, our ability to grow our companies and create jobs depends on the contributions of immigrants from all backgrounds." The letter takes a softball approach and goes out of its way not to condemn the president's executive order, noting that the tech giants "share your goal of ensuring that our immigration system meets today's security needs and keeps our country safe," and that they "welcome the changes your administration has made in recent days." The companies will also "help your administration identify other opportunities to ensure that our employees can travel with predictability and without undue delay." All the best words In fact, most of the letter reads as though the tech CEOs actually agree with the controversial order to ban people from certain countries from entering the country: it concludes by asking Trump to "use us as a resource to help achieve immigration policies that both support the work of American businesses and reflect American values." The strongest criticism of the order – which sparked thousands to protest in person at airports across the country and saw an unprecedented dissent memo from the State Department – comes in a single mealy-mouthed sentence that says "while security and vetting procedures can and should always be subject to continuous evaluation and improvement, a blanket suspension is not the right approach." In contrast to the strong, principled stance taken by Microsoft's president Brad Smith on the issue of the federal authorities trying to access people's private data on servers held outside the United States, on Thursday Smith went out of his way not to question the dubious morals or legality of Trump's immigration executive order and instead asked for special favors for Microsoft. "The President expressly gave to the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security the authority to grant exceptions on a case-by-case basis," Smith notes in an official blog post, adding: "Today Microsoft is filing a formal request asking these cabinet officers to create a process to grant exceptions that will permit 'Responsible Known Travelers with Pressing Needs' to re-enter the country while protecting the nation's security." Smith has even drafted language that would make it easier for Microsoft and similar tech companies to get their workers in the country – while leaving the hundreds of thousands of other likely affected individuals to their own devices. And just to make sure the president hears it from the horse's mouth, Smith used Trump's favorite medium and his daily tweet to link to the post with the message: "Amid the broader debate on immigration, a practical proposal to address the hardship faced by some people today." Bottom line The reality is that Silicon Valley and the broader tech industry are highly reliant on non-US citizens to stay competitive. Thanks to the concentration of big tech companies in California, it is a highly valued destination for workers, especially coders, from all over the world – and the United States' educational system simply does not provide enough of them to handle demand. Every big tech company has several people in the HR department dedicated to nothing but working the US visa program and getting individuals in. They often know government immigration officials on first-name terms due to the constant and high-volume rate of communication. The recent "Muslim ban" has already had an impact: Microsoft's Smith notes that 76 employees were immediately affected. Likewise, Google. It started immediately flying its people back into the country when it heard about the executive order. That problem would grow exponentially, however, if Trump decided to carry out his threat to change the H1-B worker visa program and so force more companies to "hire American." And while several CEOs – notably Google's Sergey Brin and Apple's Tim Cook – have made plain their personal views on Trump's order, others have stayed notably quiet. Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, who wrote an entire book about women having the confidence to lead, was asked on stage on Wednesday about her failure to attend or mention the Women's March the day after Trump's inauguration. "I just felt bad that I couldn't be there," she responded. "And, once I felt bad, I felt like I couldn't say anything." In recent days, tech companies have made big play about the money they are donating to causes supporting immigration. But in each case it has been the companies' own employees that have forced the issue, with the companies promising to match the funds that they put forward. Tech leaders seem to get this wrong a lot: It’s ok to use an economic argument to support a point, but the core must be the moral argument. — Anil Dash (@anildash) February 2, 2017 In a country where corporations are legally viewed as people and persistently promote themselves as individuals, with personal views on everything from social issues like gay marriage to congratulating individuals (one recent note: Beyonce's twins and whatever this is from Popeye's Chicken), the sad truth is that the largest and most powerful companies in the world have decided that it is not in their best interests to upset the notoriously petty and thin-skinned Donald Trump, even when his actions go against their and their employees' moral and ethical values. But hit em where it hurts – the wallet – and Big Tech will do everything it can... to carve out special exceptions for itself. ® Breaking: Uber CEO Travis Kalanick has quit Trump's economic advisory board. That board included "Elon Musk (CEO of Tesla), Mary Barra (Chairwoman/CEO of General Motors), Indra Nooyi (Chairwoman/CEO of Pepsi), Ginni Rometty (Chairwoman/CEO of IBM), Bob Iger (Chairman/CEO of Disney), Jack Welch (former Chairman of GE) and a dozen other business leaders," according to Kalanick.
