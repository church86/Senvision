Worldwide tablet shipments have declined 8.5% over the past year, Q1 is the tenth straight quarter in decline Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/04 1:20pm PDTMay 4, 2017 68 Plus 1 on G+ 41 Share on Facebook 110 Share on Twitter Total Shares219 News Remember when everyone thought tablets would replace PCs, at least for average consumers? Yeah, that didn't happen. In fact, the opposite is happening. In a report from the International Data Corporation (IDC), worldwide tablet shipments in Q1 2017 have dropped 8.5% compared to Q1 2016, with just 36.2 million devices shipped. In addition, Q1 2017 is the tenth straight quarter where the tablet market saw a decline, with the previous five quarters recording double-digit drops. It's worth noting that the IDC only counts 'slates' (tablets lacking a keyboard) and 'detachables' (tablets with first-party keyboards) as tablets. There are a few reasons for this continuing decline, which shouldn't be surprising to anyone. Convertible laptops, commonly referred to as 2-in-1s, have been cannibalizing the tablet market for a while now. The rise of larger smartphones didn't help tablets either. Apple remained top dog over the past quarter, with 8.9 million unit shipments. Samsung followed in second place, with Huawei, Amazon, and Lenovo rounding out the top five manufacturers. Apple's results likely had a small bump from the recent 9.7" iPad refresh. Samsung also released the Galaxy Tab S3 during this time, but it launched near the end of Q1, so the impact is likely negligible. Again, this shouldn't be surprising to anyone. There has been very little incentive for people with tablets to buy new ones, and Android tablets haven't seen much attention from OEMs or Google since the Honeycomb days. Press Release FRAMINGHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The worldwide tablet market once again contracted in the first quarter of 2017 (1Q17) with total shipments of 36.2 million, a year-over-year decline of 8.5%, according to preliminary data from the International Data Corporation (IDC) Worldwide Quarterly Tablet Tracker. The first quarter contraction marks the tenth straight quarter that tablets have experienced a decline over the same quarter a year earlier, with the previous five quarters recording double-digit drops. The tablet market is comprised of two different product categories, which are headed in very different directions as noted by IDC in the past. Devices offering a first-party keyboard, which IDC refers to as detachable tablets, continue to grow for the most part. Many of these devices have quickly grown to resemble products that IDC refers to as traditional notebook PCs or laptops. The other product category is slate tablets (those lacking this keyboard option), which saw shipments peak in 2014 and is now in a steep decline that IDC believes will continue throughout the forecast period. "As far as most are aware, the tablet market was created in 2010 with the launch of the original iPad, despite unsuccessful product attempts by other OEMs in the years leading up to this," said Ryan Reith, program vice president with IDC's Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Device Trackers. "The rate at which the tablet market grew from 2010 to 2013 was unlike many other consumer-oriented device markets we've seen before. However, it appears for many reasons consumers became less eager to refresh these devices, or in some instances purchase them at all. We continue to believe the leading driver for this was the increased dependency on smartphones, along with rather minimal technology and form factor progression." At the same time that this roller coaster of tablet growth, peak, and decline was taking place, the personal computer market was experiencing one the worst declines the market's history. Fast forward to 1Q17 and traditional PCs have returned to growth, albeit relatively flat growth, for the first time since 1Q12. "A long-term threat to the overall PC market lies in how the market ultimately settles on the detachable versus convertible debate," said Linn Huang, research director, Devices & Displays at IDC. "To date, detachable shipments have dwarfed those of convertibles, but growth of the former has slowed a bit. In IDC's 2017 U.S. Consumer PCD Survey, fielded over the previous two months, detachable owners held slightly more favorable attitudes towards their detachables than convertible owners did for their convertibles. However, owners of both were far more likely to recommend a convertible over a detachable." IDC's outlook is that detachables will continue to far outpace convertibles in shipments, but the market pendulum seems to be swinging back in favor of convertibles if ever so slightly. Still, the detachable market has proven it will move with major product launches and Microsoft and Apple have yet to launch their 2017 salvos. Tablet Company Highlights Apple experienced its 13th consecutive quarter of year-over-year shipment decline despite being the market leader in 1Q17. Apple's results show that it is not immune to the changing dynamics of industry and consumer demand, part of which is due to the ongoing success of its other product lines. 2016 was Apple's first full year of iPad Pro shipments, which included the launch of the smaller screen lower-cost 9.7 inch version. This product line quickly elevated Apple to the top of the growing detachable tablet market segment, and IDC believes Apple is in a good spot to remain competitive at the top of this segment despite using a 'mobile OS' while many of its competitors are entering the space with Windows-based devices. Samsung remained the number 2 tablet provider despite seeing shipments decline 1.1% year over year in 1Q17. Much like Apple, Samsung continues to migrate its tablet portfolio to the detachable segment and to support this the company launched three new products at this year's Mobile World Congress event in Barcelona in February. After supposedly leaving the PC business in 2014, Samsung now finds itself approaching the market again with a handful of Windows 10 detachable tablet models. The move isn't surprising as the entire industry seems keen on taking advantage of this market opportunity. Huawei was the only company among the top 5 to experience positive growth in 1Q17 with shipments of 2.7 million, which was up 31.7% from the 2.0 million shipped in the first quarter a year ago. Like Samsung, Huawei has also slowly migrated its tablet portfolio from an Android slate tablet lineup to now include a mix of Windows-based detachable devices. It is somewhat unclear how serious Huawei is about going down the Windows device route, but given this quarter's growth while others decline it seems the mix strategy and tablet play is working for the company. Amazon.com continues to fluctuate in and out of the top rankings with its low-cost Kindle Fire devices. In 1Q17 the company shipped 2.2 million devices, all of which continue to be aimed at a very aggressive price point with a strategy to drive content and product sales via the device. Regardless of the changing industry dynamics mentioned in this release, Amazon seems poised to remain a competitor given its market strategy. Lenovo rounded out the top 5 with 2.1 million tablets shipped in the quarter. Of all the companies in the top 5, Lenovo is likely best positioned in terms of channel strategy to grow its tablet business and IDC expects to see more of its successful notebook PC lineup migrate into the detachable tablet category. Lenovo captured 5.7% market share in 1Q17, which was down just slightly from the 5.5% market share it had at this time last year. Notes: Total tablet market includes slate tablets plus detachable tablets. References to "tablets" in this release include both slate tablets and detachable devices. The reference to 'convertibles' for convertible notebooks, which are notebook PCs that have keyboards that can either flip, spin, or twist, but unlike detachable tablets, convertible notebook keyboards are hardwired to the display.

My Nexus 7 has been in a drawer since I got my Nexus 6 and Nexus 6P. Geoff Johnson Plus ultrabooks have been getting smaller, lighter, and cheaper, so it's not as much of a pain to carry around a laptop like it was 5 years ago. Suicide_Note Agreed. Buying the N6 made my second gen N7 pretty much irrelevant/redundant, so i sold it and never bought another tablet after that. Timmy Turner Same, although I still whip it out for road trips for movies. Dan Nah, I bought a used N9 on swappa to go with my N6, I read books and e-mail and such on the N6, but the larger screen is much better for web surfing, shopping etc. Callanish My Nexus 7 LTE continues to get decent use as it splits the battery load with my 6P so I don't need to charge the phone throughout the day. It is getting long in the tooth though as far as performance though. Keeping a close eye on Lenovo's new tablets coming out in May, especially the 8 inch tab 4 plus LTE model which should make for a decent replacement to the Nexus 7 2013. Thade780 When I got my Nexus 6 I thought the same, but then I started craving a bigger screen for when I was at home and just wanted to browse Reddit and watch Youtube. In the end I got a 10" Samsung S2 and I'm in fucking love with it. It's still plenty fast and does everything I need, so I'm going to skip the S3. I may end up with a possible Tab S4 next year. Master Yates I disagree as my Galaxy Tab S2 is much nicer for surfing the net than my One Plus 3 when I'm at home. As soon as One Plus makes a tablet, I'll be all over it. sbeaulieu My Nexus 9 is working so great it make me want to buy another one. /s & /s Peter Silie I'm fine with my N9 :) (/nosarcasm) wjrandon Burn the Nexus 9 with fire. freddyba I have a Samsung Galaxy Tab S 10.5", and it works great. However I won't buy another Galaxy Tab S(X) until they get a 16:9 screen again. I will just stick with what I have, replace the battery in a few years if need be. However I will gladly take suggestions on 16:9 tablets if any one has them! Marty They say the iPad is also in decline. I find that difficult to believe because I own a number of iPads and find them to be the finest web browsing tool ever created. I use mine for media playing, web browsing and a few other task-related things. I came from a PC, which is all I cared to use for web browsing and everything else. But since owning an iPad, the PC now seems clunky at best. I hate to even boot my PCs up. I relegate them strictly to command line tasks. They just don't provide the ease and simplicity of usage I experience with my iPads. I also own Android tablets. There has never been an Android tablet in my experience that has been worth a damn for reliable web browsing or other usage. In my opinion they are the absolute worst devices yet. So, given the value I deem of the iPad trying to understand why it's not selling like gangbusters, I just wonder if people aren't buying Android tablets, getting the same horrifically crappy experience I have with them and then condemning all tablets as worthless...the iPad included? I just wonder if people are being terminally pessimistic about *all* tablets because of any experience with Android tablets? I can understand that if that's happening. I've tended to be that way with things at times myself. catalysto I can't speak to the decline of the iPad, but I absolutely hate any tablet browsing experience. Mobile web browsing is painfully limited in many cases, and for that reason alone, I cannot get into the idea of replacing my laptop with a tablet. I'd get a Chromebook before getting a tablet (though in an ideal situation, I'd have a nice, convertible ultrabook). Marty I've done pretty much ever configuration of PC. I started out buying an eMachines tower a very long time ago. Then I bought a Velocity Micro tower rig. Then I started building my own custom tower rigs. Built several and even sold one on eBay trying to go into the custom PC business. Didn't work out due to family-related issues. Then I got into laptops and have owned a handful. Now I'm into tablet PCs. I own two: a Sony 11.6" Vaio Tap 11 and a Surface 3. None of them have been as convenient to use as my iPads. I doubt I will ever buy another PC...unless MS can somehow radically improve Windows to where it's as convenient and easy to use as an iPad. Not likely, though. catalysto Yeah, but none of that addresses the software limitations of a mobile browser. I understand that it's important to find a good device, but I think that can already be found in several existing ultrabook and convertible devices. But of course, if you are fine with the mobile browsing experience, that's totally fine, too. iPads are definitely great for that! Marty The hardware... generally... isn't the problem with PCs, it's the software and browsers that presents the biggest convenience blockage. Microsoft's Edge browser is about the best you can get for user convenience, but it oales in comparison to Safari on the iPad. I was a big Firefox fan for PC browsing, and on powerful enough equipment it's really good. But on a Surface 3, it sucks. So it all depends on the configuration of a PC to get the best out of it. I agree, the capability of mobile browsers can't match a PC experience. But for general web browsing usage, the iPad can't be beat. catalysto I have to disagree. Chrome is great, and it has given me the best browsing experience by far -- especially because of its speed and cross-device syncing. And again, I loathe any sort of mobile browser, so pretty much any desktop browser would be preferable to me. But this is obviously very subjective, so I guess we'll have to agree to disagree. I mean, it's great that you are so satisfied with the iPad, but making general statements like "can't be beat" is inherently incorrect because of different people's preferences. By the way, I only mentioned hardware because you brought it up when describing all the different machines you've tried. Marty It's not incorrect. People that haven't used an iPad for web surfing are basing their assertions on the Android experience. Yes, mobile browsing on any Android sucks bad...at least used to till Samsung Internet Beta came along. But I have used Chrome on all systems and the bookmarks system on mobile Chrome makes it entirely miserable for people who are used to a desktop browsing experience. Safari alleviates much of the misery by providing a near-desktop experience, but without a mouse. catalysto It is indeed incorrect because it's based on a subjective evaluation. There's no "right answer". We have several iOS devices in our home, so I've used iPads and iPhones extensively. Regardless, I hate any mobile browsing experience -- on iPad or otherwise. Mobile means any mobile browser on any OS. Though I will say that I much prefer Chrome on Android to Safari on iOS, so, again, subjective. And I find the Chrome bookmarks work great, so I don't know what you're talking about there either. The bookmark and tab syncing is another of my favorite features, actually. Marty You keep expounding on Chrome's syncing capabilities. I'm talking about actual usage. If I have to press a menu button and then press another button to find my bookmarks, IT IS NOT A DESKTOP BROWSER EXPERIENCE. You absolutely have immediate access to bookmarks on a desktop browser. You absolutely have immediate access to bookmarks in mobile Safari. You do not have immediate access to bookmarks on mobile Chrome. And you CANNOT use desktop chrome on Android. Jeeeze! How the hell are people so blind and so deft??? catalysto I'm not expounding on anything; I'm just mentioning a feature I really like about Chrome and one of the reasons I prefer it over other browsers. In any case, I see this conversation is going nowhere. So as I suggested earlier, we'll just have to agree to disagree. =) Marty Yeah, whatever. Thankfully there's now a much better alternative on Android. No need to put up with Google's ignorance or laziness. Marty Here's what I hear people like you say...people who seem to f*cking love the bookmarks in mobile Chrome: "I have to press a billion buttons to get to bookmarks in mobile Chrome, but they're there. What's wrong?" Nexus Hexus I find using my Acer X34 Monitor, Core i7 7700k @5Ghz, GTX 1070, 32GB Ram, 960 EVO SSD to be worlds better then any iPad. You're one of those people that say your new phone or tablet is better to use then his 10 year old budget computer. Marty To each, his own. Brandon V. Fletcher iPad sales have been going down for a while. https://www.recode.net/2017/1/31/14460952/apple-ipad-sales-still-falling mxwp it's none of those reasons. it is because people with ipads don't buy new ipads every year, unlike with their iphones. everyone that wants one pretty much already has one. Marty To a certain extent, that's probably true. I know for myself that if my 16GB iPad Air 2 hadn't kept running out of space whenever I tried to install a few free apps BGR's daily listing, I would have kept using it and never would have bought a new one with more storage. But what you're saying assumes everyone already owns an iPad. Not likely. I run into people all the time online and in person who don't own one. So I believe there's a huge marketing potential if Apple can figure out how to sell the iPad properly. JLV90 Well most people use tablets for media consumption you don't need much performance to run netflix and youtube. RiftSilver I'm wondering if I'm just not looking, or uniformed. But what happened to good budget friendly tablets like the Nexus 7 (2013)? I love mine, still going strong. I know myself and others I know are in the market for a new good tablet, but for what most good tablets are going for now, ~$600, I'd rather buy a laptop. Jonathan Litwinka They stopped being "good". You can get an okay tablet for between $150-$200 at Costco or Amazon, but the tech is still comparable to the Nexus 7 (2013). Master Yates Agreed. The Nexus 7 2013 was way ahead of its time and that why its lasted so long. I'm not an LCD fan but the screen on the Nexus 7 2013 remains awesome. Callanish Keep your eye on the Lenovo Tab 4 range being released in May. Good pricing, decent specs and running Nougat 7.1.1. Like you, my Nexus 7 13 has been a workhorse, but performance has become my biggest gripe, even after cleaning out the cache now and then. Defenestratus My Pixel C is basically a laptop. It works beautifully for what I use it for - web browsing, kindle-reading and minor productivity work. fgd135 I replaced my tablet with a Samsung Chromebook Plus and couldn't be happier. destinyhud planning on doing this but waiting more devices burkett375 Waiting on the Pro...the processor on the + has me worried. dizel123 There are basically 2 classes of tablets. The decent ones that are waaaayyyy overpriced and the cheap ones that are absolute garbage. And most of them have very little to no software support. If companies sold decent tablets for decent prices and guaranteed updates, maybe people would buy them. destinyhud this is why i think a chromebook pixel c2 would be the best of both world. pixel c was just $500 Mix Bought an 8 " $200 Samsung tab A for my 2 year old for Paw Patrol and what not and it's great, the Galaxy tab S3 is $799...like what the balls Samsung!? Who would ever pay that for a freaking tablet? Zap Rowsdower Someone who has somebody else paying for it, like a school or company or relative as a gift. I bought a no-name Android tablet a few months ago, with keyboard and case for US$39.00. I popped a 512MB sd card in it and it's in my workshop for playing music on bluetooth speakers, watching how-to videos, casting to a nearby TV, whatever ... and other than a crap screen resolution, it's fast and works great. $39.00! Nicholas Conrad You're forgetting about the Nexus 7 Leonardo Coleman I initiated freelancing over world wide web, participating in some fundamental assignments which mainly needed a personal computer and also having access to internet in addition to Now I am more delighted than ever... half a year have gone by since i begun this and additionally i had income total of $36k...

Ethan Nelson-Moore In a root terminal run: sleep 5; echo ff > /proc/ektf_dbg Then set your tablet on a flat surface and don't touch it for 5 seconds. It will recalibrate the screen. mxwp that was stated in the article... people with tablets are not buying new ones Nicholas Conrad Sure, because all they're really great at is watching movies on planes, and a 4 year old one is as good at that as a new one. No compelling new features to drive the upgrade cycle. Kristian Ivanov And the Shield K1 (the actual successor to the Nexus 7 2013) shonangreg Yeah, I've been waiting for a couple of years to buy a replacement for my Nexus 7. Other than the NVidia Shield K1, nothing was decent. So, I finally got an iPad Pro 9.7 last year (discount coupon with a pocket WiFi device). I still want a replacement for the Nexus 7, but I'm reluctant to buy the Shield K1 now as it is at the end of its life (and still not heavily discounted, at least here in Japan). Nicholas Conrad Yeah, I didn't buy a K1 because I was convinced an X1 tablet was just around the corner, regret that now. Sorry to hear about your ipad: I had one once, it was terrible. Zap Rowsdower Why was owning your iPad a terrible experience? That would be helpful to know. Nicholas Conrad It was my only ever apple device. It started with an ordeal over signing into the darn thing to begin with because you have to have an apple id to sign in, and it can't create one for you, then itunes is a racket, you need a new $15 app for everything you want to do. The darn thing doesn't even have a file system, so you need to buy apps that can move files from where some apps can see them to where other apps can see them. Playing movies or music from my LAN was nearly impossible because apple wants you to buy all of your content from them, and it doesn't play well with anything not made by apple. But mostly it was just buggy. I had constant app crashes and resprings, kept losing work onenote data and had to chuck it in a drawer. I mean, isn't their whole thing that it "just works"? There wasn't one redeeming thing about it if you're not already entrenched in the ios ecosystem. You still can't even set gosh-darn default apps on ios for crying out loud.... shonangreg My iPad has become my favorite device. I use the iPad for all communications (all duplicated on my phone and most on my N7). It is only when I'm at my desk or walking that my PCs or my phone get their turn. Si vis pacem, para bellum To me it's not even that, it's the lack of choice between the very good ones (the "way overpriced" ones). I have a 2.5+ years old Tab S 10.5 LTE which I love and use a lot when at home and even use as a laptop replacement when I live part of the year abroad (I used to carry my Windows laptop with me, not anymore). I don't see any real alternatives to my Tab S (I may be interested in a Pixel C, now that with Nougat it has finally got MultiWindows, but it's not sold here in Italy) and I have not upgraded to a Tab S2 nor am I probably going to upgrade to the Tab S3 because the marginal improvements are simply not worth it. Actually, they almost feel like a downgrade since they have removed the IR blaster (which I DO use), they put smaller batteries, they went for the 4:3 aspect ratio (I much prefer 16:10) and the S3 has a glass back (I MUCH prefer the "rubbery" one of my Tab S! At least they didn't choose a F'ing metal back, which is the thing that I hate the most on handheld devices). Compelling new features (like an *integrated* S-Pen, I am a Note user from the original one and I miss it on my tablet!) or substantial improvements in specs/battery life are the only reasons who would motivate me to upgrade since I don't have any problems with my Tab S: while not exactly blazing fast it runs quite well (it's on stock, rooted Marshmallow) and still gives me 5+ hours of SOT. YaKillaCJ Exactly. Then theirs Windows 2in1s. Windows 10 is definitely the way to go for 10inch screens. Ah I see what Microsoft did there lol. UniBroW Except the new ipad at $329, it's lightening fast and loads web content like a champ. Couple that with ad blockers from the App Store and you have a great tablet that can't do most PC things but amazingly good once you get over the home screen PVL_93_RU Here's the problem though... it's an Apple device. If you were an avid user of something like the Nexus 7 - you'd have to make a big switch to a whole new platform. Meaning you need to get used to new software, to deal with certain missing features, as well as having to repurchase the entire library of your apps and games, which is a big investment on top of buying the iPad in the first place. Then there's cases, accessories, .. JSo Well if a company would make something worth buying it might change. Marty You mean if a company would make an *Android tablet* worth buying it might change. There are none. Brian Klippel We buy used nexus 9's in this house. With nexus gone, all of the new tablets on the market are way to expensive for what they offer. Pretty much only the pixel will get more than a year of updates and it's just too expensive to watch youtube and play candy crush on. I had one samsung tablet that I smashed with a hammer because it was such a POS. Master Yates Nexus 9's? I'm surprised people aren't paying you to take them away. Biff Wonsley Last fall I bought an Asus ZenPad 8.0 (Z380M.) Not especially impressive specs, but it's fine for the usual apps & reading books & only cost $130. And about a month ago it was updated with Nougat, which I didn't in my wildest dreams expect. I have a Nexus 6, but I can't imagine reading a book with it. So long as 8" or so tablets are available, I'll have one. What passes for a phablet these days isn't big enough. Jay There hasn't exactly been many new and/or good tablets to help with these statistics either. Marc Edwards "Apple remained top tog" I think you mean top dog there my friend. fijisiv are you sure he didn't mean "dop tog"? Mix Maybe he was asking us a question? "Apple remained, got pot?" illregal There have been no new tablet releases.. Cakefish No need to replace my iPad Air 2 yet, it's still a beast. And I'm sure it'll handle iOS 11 just fine. destinyhud i dont think my ipad air will handle ios 11. i might not update and later get a Chromebook detachable Taios I understand this. But I so so so want someone to release a replacement for my nexus 7 2013. destinyhud come on chromebook pixel c2 Dan The "problem" if you want to look at it as one, is that people that want one have one and don't need an upgrade. If it ain't broke why buy a new one? Same thing in the PC market, it's not a decline in number used or in the house, just in sold because there is nothing wrong with the current one. Iamsecond Exactly! It irritates me every time I see a 'tablets sales decline' article that no-one seems to mention this. Tablets are simple devices for simple use cases such as web browsing and media consumption and so most older tablets do the job just fine. shonangreg A lot of Nexus 7 owners have been waiting ... and wanting ... Other than the Shield K1, there has been nothing. I do watch Huawei with interest; seems too locked down, though. We were told long ago that the bottleneck in OS upgrades for our phones were the carriers. This isn't a problems for tablets, generally, yet their track record is maybe even worse than phones. Leonardo Baez to be fair there is also less tablet offers to the market. me me I have Nexus 7 2013, Google Pixel C, and a Toshiba Chromebook 2. The Chromebook I have repaired it twice due the flexible plastic screen, the Pixel C has a tough outer shell construction and survives drops, the N7 2013 is still going strong but I use wireless charging to extend its socket life and custom kernel with 90% max charge to extend battery life. I'd happily buy newer if they were better. Innovation in mobiles is far greater, there's more of a reason to upgrade more often than with tablets. [A]dri[A]n I absolutely LOVE my Samsung Galaxy Tab A 10.1 (2015) It's a pretty damn good tablet for $249 or whatever they're priced at now. The battery life is amazingly great and the performance is more than good enough. Lasts about 3 to 4 days with around 15 hours of SOT. Like someone stated before, I'm pretty sure sales are down because the need/want to buy a new tablet isn't as important or relevant as buying a new phone. Mix Snagged the 8" Tab A for $199 CAD and it's a wicked little tablet and you can get 4 of them for the price of a single Galaxy S3 tablet.....Like, why would someone even consider an $800 tablet? whispy_snippet And people wonder why Google won't take tablets seriously. AQ I bought my first tablet last month, isn't as fast or high resolution as my phone but it lasts long & keeps me from charging my phone as much. it was cheap, gsm unlocked, has 2GB ram & 16GB rom+microsd & still has stereo front facing speakers. I doubt I could find another tablet twice it's price having at least those things. ethd ZTE Trek 2 HD, by chance? I replaced my old Nexus 10 with one of those and I couldn't be happier. It's shocking how good cheap tablets have gotten. AQ Yup, though I got it for only $70 it retails for $150 from AT&T, which still isn't bad for all the features it has. I love that its GSM unlocked, no WiFi only limits when I really want to use something that requires internet when away from home. Also it's great for GPS (loud, big & bright). StopBeingOffendedDERP psshhh. Who needs a tablet when you have a Surface Book. Best of both worlds. Kamal Qara’in People are increasingly looking for lightwaight, portable devices that mirror the functionality of a traditional PC. And that's unfortunately where Android tablets fail; there's little to no 'Value add'; powerful, tablet-optimised apps are almost non-existent on the platform xyz Great. I never liked tablets. Only PCs and smartphones for me. I guess people who bought tablets are satisfied with 6-7" phablets. me me No. I own 10" and 7" tablets, and I like 10" tablets when I'm spending days moving, and like 7" tablet when flying. The issues is there's nothing new worthwhile in newer tablets to bother with the effort to upgrade. A mobile however is always having a compromise of features vs performance so mobiles are being refreshed. Tablets are not being refreshed. This is about technology innovation being slower in tablets than mobiles so tablets are being refreshed less often. Larger tablets are just expensive, and Chromebooks overlap. russjr08 I have a Nexus 7 2013 and an iPad Air 2 and I absolutely love my N7 but it's definitely starting to show it's age. And I'm just not that into iOS to really use my iPad a lot. I also have a Surface Pro 3, but it's waaaaaay too big to be the "tablet" that I casually use to read on. Great for doing something like Netflix or Hulu, but otherwise... I'm just kind of relying on my phone (currently N5X) for most of my stuff. Vay L My n7 2013 touch barely work and i had this problem for over a year now. Im waiting for Lenovo tab 4 10 plus to be released this month. it looks promising on paper Nathan J Remember the Apple Newton? Apple's failed tablet under CEO John Sculley before Steve Jobs' triumphant return? It utterly failed. And now the iPad is pretty much the only successful tablet. It's weird because the PADD on Star Trek: The Next Generation was so cool. It was basically a Nexus 7 or iPad Mini in size, but thinner, I believe. And let's face it, LCARS (the OS) is pretty, but it's also pretty lame. Too many buttons, it's not a real OS, it's just for show. Even forgiving that, the huge borders on the fixed content areas are ugly. What it could do, we can do with tablets now. Access any information — Google and Wikipedia. Access all art and media — streaming services, and Google. Control certain ship functions — Google/Apple Home. We have that tech now and it's just not as cool as they make it out to be. Also, does anyone remember where they kept PADDs? They don't have pockets. They don't have holsters for them. (They do have phaser and tricorder holsters, though.) I've never seen a stack of PADDs waiting to be picked up. I've seen people set them down and pick them back up, but I've never seen a bunch of them. They just kind of come and go. I think if you have an Android phone, there's no real need for a tablet. Either you have a large phone or a huge phone, and it's partway to tablet land anyway. I can see having a small or normal sized iPhone and an iPad or iPad Mini to go with it. But I have the normal sized iPhone, and I don't want an iPad. Here's where I want Android. On a larger device. That's where I want to spend time customizing. My wife has a 2013 Nexus 7, and it's a good device. I want one in 8" with modern specs and either a microSD card slot, or 64GB of storage. Or 128GB. Or let me hook my portable SSD up to it. But I'm really not a tablet guy. Just a gadget hound... TedPhillips as someone who's recently been rewatching TnG, there are stacks of padd's (of various sizing), and the 'vertical file divider' style for collections of padd's on the show. Sootie I own a nexus 7 an ipad air 2 (or whatever the latest ones are called) an old ipad and some other big tablet plus laptops desktops but 90% of the time everything but my phone (pixel xl) is flat plus my phone works perfectly fine for everything I do with it (which admittedly is basically just reddit and youtube) and is always charged Peter Silie And I can tell you why it's like this: because there are so few tablets you can actually buy unless you want to spend a premium amount of money. There used to be way more choices, especially in the Android tablet market. Funem Android tablet specs have dropped while phone specs have increased. If I go online or to the shops its difficult to find a branded Android device that even has 32gb of memory, sometimes its even hard to find one with 16gb whilst phones have more and more crammed into them tablets just seem to have stagnated. The last tablet I purchased was the Tab Pro 12" which was a great tablet, but them Samsung didn't even upgrade the OS much and kind of just left it and this wasn't a cheap device. I'm still looking for a decent replacement with a 10" plus screen, 32gb of ram, SD card support and a decent screen resolution as I want to read my magazines on it and watch films and play some of the games that require a bigger screen real estate to work properly. The only one that came close recently was the Shield K1 Tablet, but the screen is to small. tinabolina2017 They aren't giving people what they want.the chips in then are too slow and the LTE is too expensive royrov Well, if Google just could sell their Pixel hardware here on Norway, I would have bought one a long time ago.. Richard Markert The verdict is in: nobody really wants tablets. Lord Argyris I'll just echo a lot of what has already been said here and in the article: the tablet product category as a whole has been cannibalized by other devices. Even traditional laptops have started to make inroads. Recently I narrowed down my choice for a new computer to a Surface Pro 4 or a 13-inch MBP and went with the latter. It's small and light enough that I don't miss the additional portability of the Surface or a new tablet. Part of my intention with the new purchase was to largely replace multiple devices, including my Nexus 7 (2013). The latter mostly sits in a drawer now, being taken out only when I want to go further than a few rooms over and have a computing device with me. Nearly three and a half years ago, when the Nexus 7 (2013) was new, this would have been inconceivable. Even high end laptops were prohibitively heavier, larger, and had worse battery life, not to mention they still in some cases ran hot and had noisy fans. They also typically had low resolution (>200 PPI) and poorly calibrated screens (sometimes even with a sub-sRGB gamut and a TN panel), which made media consumption a significantly worse experience than you could get on much cheaper tablet (and smartphone) hardware. Especially in the PC space, the hardware has since gotten much better (the lingering MacBook Air range being a notable exception). Over the years, the list of exclusive advantages one could get from buying a tablet has grown shorter, and new product categories (2-in-1s, large smartphones) have emerged to draw away market share. I'm actually glad tablets happened, as they seem to have been a great catalyst to make the other computing categories improve. Mike I purchased and used a Nexus 10 quite a bit when I had a Galaxy Nexus. After getting a Note 2 I just didn't see the need anymore. I tried to convert it to be a laptop replacement but all of the keyboard/mouse peripherals were pretty bad. About a year or two ago I purchased an Asus Chromebook Flip and for half the price of the Nexus 10 it does so much more (Albeit, it was released a couple years later but still, a tablet can't do what a dedicated laptop can). As someone who was one of the biggest fans of tablets when they first started becoming mainstream (Owned a Tab S2, Nexus 7, Nexus 10) I wouldn't mind if they just died off at this point. PVL_93_RU No surprise there, really The classic tablets as we know them are slowly becoming less popular because the tech advancements in them have slowed down, people aren't needed to replace their current tablets with newer models as often as phones, and the introduction of projects like RemixOS or the Android App compatibility in ChromeOS, as well as the rising spread of convertibles, is making the classic tablet pretty much an obsolete product Unless the tablet market makes a revolution of some sort (be it in functionality or hardware etc) - the decline will only continue. Hell, even Apple is struggling, despite bringing the Pro and the Mini to the table justmy2pennies2012 My Ipad Air is 3 1/2 years old. My only complaint is I purchased the LTE verison and it only has 16GB. It still does what I need it to do, comsume media, web surf, etc. I use my Laptop for my computing needs. I would love to replace it with an Android tablet. My son still has a Nexus 2012/2013 tablet but it is slow has heck. He prefers his Android phone over his old as heck android tablet. I tend to replace my phone evry 22-24 months, but tend to go 3-4 years on a tablet. The newer Ipad isn't to bad feature and price wise IMHO. I had the first Moto tablet (yes the heavy one) but returned it within 30 days back in 2010. I think once manufacturers can produce a quality tablet in a mid price range (not too expensive not too cheap where they can't support it), sales will increase. With the lower price of the newer Ipads,this makes it harder for android tablets to compete on features and price. 1966CAH The only people really surprised by this are the ones who hopped aboard the "Tablets are the Next Big Thing!!!" hypetrain. There's a market for tablets just like there's a market for smartwatches. Neither of them have or likely will fulfill the pipe dreams of their early cheerleaders. They have largely achieved their market saturation point is all, and the demand just isn't what was hyped. I had both versions of the Nexus 7 and now have the Shield K1. When I get home at night, I put down the phone and use the tablet almost exclusively. I don't have any need to upgrade until such time as mine bites the dust or it's too obsolete, but when the time comes I will be looking to replace it. Colin Rowlands If you are mostly using a tablet for consuming media and browsing, there simply isn't any real need to upgrade a tablet until your current one dies, so it is no wonder that sales are decreasing. Bernhard Mähr Waiting since two years for a good 7" table with recent Android version. Ricardo Torres Still using my Nvidia Shield Tablet original not K1 but I did get a k1 as a backup after that recall scare. Use it every day have not had a reason to get a new tablet.

More than 30,000 people are expected to attend the annual meeting, and participate in company-sponsored activities, though the main attraction is CEO Warren Buffett and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger's Q&A session on Saturday. Nati Harnik AP Photo Business May 06, 2017 6:08 PM The Latest: Berkshire shareholders reject 3 proposals The Associated Press LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story OMAHA, Neb. The Latest on Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting (all times local): 4:50 p.m. Berkshire Hathaway shareholders have rejected three proposals that would have required the company to sell off stock investments linked to fossil fuels and disclose more information about its political contributions and methane emissions. Advocacy groups proposed the measures because they wanted Berkshire to change its practices. Buffett and Berkshire's board opposed all three shareholder measures Saturday. The board argued that both the proposed reports are unnecessary and selling off stocks tied to fossil fuels could hurt Berkshire's investment returns. With Buffett controlling about one-third of the vote, the measures faced an uphill battle. But the groups pushing the proposals had an opportunity to make their case before thousands of Berkshire shareholders. Climate scientist Mark Mann with Penn State University urged Buffett and Berkshire shareholders to take a stand against climate change. He said doing so could add to the company's legacy, but the proposal failed. ___ 4:20 p.m. Eighty-six-year-old Warren Buffett and 93-year-old Charlie Munger say they both try to continue learning and that shows up in the investments they've made for Berkshire Hathaway in recent years. Munger says Berkshire's purchase of 133 million shares of Apple stock shows Buffett is learning because for decades Buffett resisted investing in technology companies. Buffett says he came to realize that Apple behaves more like a consumer products company than a tech company, so he became comfortable investing in it. ___ 3:25 p.m. Billionaire Warren Buffett says growing health care costs continue to be a drag on the performance of U.S. businesses, and he's not sure the reform package Republicans passed will do much to help that. Buffett said Saturday that health care costs have gone up incredibly, and are expected to continue increasing. The high cost of U.S. health care puts American businesses at a competitive disadvantage with other countries. Buffett says the one thing he's sure the Republican reforms will do is deliver a big tax cut to people like him with more than $250,000 income and significant investment income. ___ 2:45 p.m. Investor Warren Buffett says Wells Fargo made a huge error in failing to respond promptly to its sales practices scandal. Buffett told Berkshire Hathaway shareholders Saturday that the bank should have done more to correct the problem once it was discovered. Buffett says Wells Fargo didn't act promptly when it discovered the problem. The bank said last fall that its employees opened up 2 million bank accounts without customer approval to meet unrealistic sales goals. Berkshire is Wells Fargo's biggest shareholder. Buffett says he still believes in the long-term prospects of the bank even though Wells Fargo mishandled the scandal. ___ 2:30 p.m. Warren Buffett continues looking for major acquisitions for Berkshire Hathaway. Buffett told shareholders Saturday that Berkshire could do a very large deal because it has more than $90 billion cash on hand. Buffett says he likes to keep at least $20 billion to $25 billion on hand for emergencies or any large insurance claims, but he's actively looking for a big deal. Currently, Buffett believes he can find a good use for Berkshire's cash, so the company doesn't pay dividends and rarely repurchases its stock. Buffett says the board would look at both options if it ever decided he could generate good returns by investing the money. ___ 1 p.m. Investor Warren Buffett says one of the most-important skills his eventual successor will need is a talent for allocating all the cash Berkshire Hathaway's businesses generate. Buffett said at Saturday's annual meeting that it's crucial his successor have what he calls a "money mind." Buffett has no plans to leave his job as chairman and CEO of the Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate he built through acquisitions over more than 50 years. The 86-year-old told his investors that the company's plan to replace him hasn't changed. Buffett says his successor will have to be able to wisely invest Berkshire's cash without making major mistakes. Currently, Berkshire has more than $90 billion in cash on hand. ___ 11:25 a.m. Billionaire Warren Buffett says Berkshire Hathaway's insurance businesses will continue to thrive regardless of who's leading them. At Berkshire's shareholder meeting Saturday, Buffett was asked about the challenges of replacing Ajit Jain because Buffett has heaped praise on Jain for years. Buffett acknowledges some insurance deals might be impossible to replicate once Jain is gone, but says a lot of solid habits are institutionalized at Berkshire's insurance companies. Berkshire owns Geico and General Reinsurance as well as a number of specialized insurers that handle malpractice, worker's compensation and other businesses. For his own position as Berkshire's CEO and chairman, the 86-year-old Buffett says there's been no change in the plan to eventually replace him. ___ 11:10 a.m. It's hard to say exactly how much Berkshire Hathaway would benefit from a major tax cut. Berkshire CEO Warren Buffett says the effect to a tax cut would vary across the more than 90 different businesses the conglomerate owns. For instance, at the regulated utilities Berkshire owns, any benefit from a tax cut will be passed on to customers through lower rates. In other businesses, it will depend on how much competitive pressure there is to lower prices after a tax cut. Buffett made his comments during the company's annual meeting Saturday in Omaha, Nebraska. ___ 10:45 a.m. Investors Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger told Berkshire Hathaway shareholders that they probably should have recognized Google's brilliance and invested in it. But the top two executives at Berkshire had long ruled out technology companies because they believe it's too hard to predict which ones will prevail. So they missed out on Google even though they knew the business well because Berkshire's Geico insurance unit advertised with the search engine. Munger says in retrospect, he thinks he and Buffett were smart enough to figure out Google's prospects early on, but they didn't. In recent years, Buffett has ventured a bit into tech investing but with mixed results. He said Friday that Berkshire recently sold off one-third of its 81 million IBM shares because the investment hasn't performed as well as he expected. Berkshire holds about 133 million Apple shares, but Buffett says he looks at that more as a consumer products company instead of a technology company. ___ 10 a.m. Investor Warren Buffett says he believes it works better to hold his employees to a high standard and expect them to do the right thing instead of imposing extensive rules. Buffett says he always urges Berkshire Hathaway employees to protect the company's reputation above all and avoid questionable behavior. Buffett made his comments during the company's annual meeting Saturday in Omaha, Nebraska. He believes that will help Berkshire avoid scandals like the one that hurt Wells Fargo last year. Berkshire is Wells Fargo's biggest shareholder. Berkshire is known for its decentralized structure with fewer than 30 people at headquarters that allows the more than 90 companies it owns to largely run themselves. "We count very heavily on principles of behavior rather than loads of rules," Buffett said. Buffett says Berkshire will occasionally have problems because it has 367,000 employees. ___ 9:20 a.m. Billionaire Warren Buffett paid tribute to Vanguard founder Jack Bogle at Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting Saturday. Bogle attended Berkshire's meeting Saturday after Buffett praised him in his annual letter to shareholders this year. Buffett has long recommended that most casual investors would be better off investing in index funds steadily over time instead of trying to pick individual stocks. Buffett says Bogle played a major role in creating the index funds that are common today, and that has helped millions of investors earn more because the fees are so cheap. Buffett, who is 86, said Bogle will celebrate his 88th birthday Monday. Buffett joked that if Bogle holds out for just a couple more years, he'll be old enough to qualify for an executive job at Berkshire. Buffett's Vice Chairman Charlie Munger is 93. ___ 7:10 a.m. When billionaire Warren Buffett toured the exhibit hall where Berkshire Hathaway companies are selling their products outside Berkshire's annual meeting, he was again surrounded by a pack of reporters, shareholders and security officers. At Berkshire's annual meeting Saturday, Buffett is the celebrity that everyone wants to get close to. While Buffett met Mr. Peanut at the Kraft Heinz booth, Miami Dolphins defensive lineman Ndamukong Suh wandered a few feet away without a crowd. While he wandered through the hall, Buffett told reporters that he continues to believe the economy is growing steadily at about 2 percent a year. And he told a recent college graduate to try to find career that makes use of her skills and appeals to her passions. Shareholder Elizabeth Varner said it was fun just listening to Buffett while walking near him in the crowd and trying to shoot pictures of the down-to-Earth billionaire. ___ 6:30 a.m. Listening to Warren Buffett never gets old to the thousands of Berkshire Hathaway shareholders filling an arena to listen to the billionaire investor at the company's annual meeting. The chance to hear Buffett and Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger field questions for more than five hours is again expected to attract more than 30,000 people to Omaha, Nebraska, on Saturday. Seventy-year-old Dave Mueller flew out from Denver, Colorado, for his fourth meeting because he loves hearing the 86-year-old Buffett and 93-year-old Munger talk. Dozens of companies Berkshire owns set up booths in an adjoining 200,000-square-foot exhibit hall to sell their products and take questions about their businesses.

The post has since been taken down, but initially included the caption: “How did I end up in the studio with Dr Dre ON THE night his deal went public that he did with Apple 3.2 BILLION!!!!! The BEATS HEADPHONES JUST CHANGED HIP HOP!!!!!!” WATCH: The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Financial Times reported the story Thursday citing sources briefed on the talks. Beats by Dre headphones‘ annual sales revenues have reportedly gone up to $1.5 billion since the company was founded with music executive Jimmy Iovine began selling headphones in 2008. The deal would include the new Beats Music streaming service, which Apple is likely acquiring to compete with streaming services like Pandora and Spotify after the company’s iTunes Radio failed to impress the industry. Apple’s revenue growth has declined sharply in recent years, and the company only entered the broadly popular streaming market last year — late because of former CEO Steve Jobs’ reported unfavorable opinion of music subscription services. The company continues to be the largest seller of music downloads, but is losing market share to companies like Amazon. Purchasing Beats would mark Apple’s largest acquisition ever. The headphones retail between about $169.95 to $449.95, depending on model and features, and despite many music and sound industry experts describing their quality as “extraordinarily bad,” the brand has become enormously popular as a fashion item among a younger consumer base, and the popular alternative to standard earbuds models. Beats’ success is due in large part to its wide profit margins – despite the steep prices of the popular bass-heavy headphone models, each individual unit reportedly only costs around $14 to produce. Private equity firm Carlyle Group invested $500 million in Beats last year, and valued the company at more than $1 billion. Neither Apple nor Beats would comment on the deal in the original reports, and the briefed sources said they were still in the negotiation stage. Though the companies have yet to consummate the agreement, and it could still fall through, if things go as planned the official announcement could be made as early as next week.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Site Archive Spreading the word on safety Saturday May 6, 2017 at 8:07 PM May 6, 2017 at 8:07 PM Monica Solano Staff Writer @DP_MonicaInes APPLE VALLEY — Disaster can strike at any given moment and many Apple Valley residents were preparing for the worst on Saturday. Despite high winds, hundreds of people came out to learn how to be prepared for a natural disaster at the first Family Preparedness Fair hosted by the Town of Apple Valley. “The goal for this event was to keep our community safe while also putting into perspective that an emergency can occur at any given moment,” said Emergencies Service Officer Joseph Ramos. “We have so much great information here and we want to assure our residents are getting the best to be prepared.” The Town of Apple Valley, Apple Valley Fire Protection District and the Apple Valley Police Activities League (PAL) came together to bring awareness to the community and to better prepare  neighborhoods their residents on fire, flood, earthquake and other safety measures. With 38 groups and organizations participating in the event, guests were not only educated on safety practices, but they were also given the opportunity to experience a little shake, rattle and roll thanks to the earthquake and fire seismic simulator provided by San Bernardino County Fire Office of Emergency Services. Nicole Nunez and her son Chase Danger Nunez, 5, of Apple Valley, told the Daily Press the simulator provided them with quite a jolt. “It definitely put things into perspective once you were in there and felt the tremors start to get bigger and bigger,” Nicole Nunez said. Attendees also received information on fire prevention, water safety, car seat installation, utility safety, children’s fingerprinting and other vital and useful safety information. “It’s important that people know how to prepare for the worst and this is a great event to get the word out there and help others,” said AFVPD Fire Chief Sid Hultquist. Marylu Maya and her daughter Sheily Torres, 13, of Apple Valley said they come to the event every year and always “leave learning something new” about safety preparedness and appreciates the time and effort everyone makes to help educate them. “We also want to relate the message to our residents that they can come up to any of their local officials with questions on safety at any given time,” Ramos said. “We’re here to ensure you are safe and well prepared.” Monica Solano can be reached at MSolano @VVDailyPress.com or at 760-951-6231.

For nearly two years, Apple has been driving vehicles around the world to collect data for Apple Maps—widely believed to be street-level imagery. Since 2015, the vehicles have surveyed over 30 states in the United States, in addition to parts of the United Kingdom, Italy, France, and Sweden. Apple said it will blur faces and license plates on collected images prior to publication, suggesting that it could be working on adding a Street View feature to Apple Maps, similar to what Google Maps has offered for several years. But, the imagery and other mapping data could be used for a variety of purposes. When Apple's fleet of Dodge Caravans first hit the streets, it was speculated they could be the basis of an Apple Car. But those rumors quieted down after the vans were labeled with Apple Maps decals, and because Apple has shifted towards autonomous driving software, rather than an entire vehicle, at least for now. Moreover, the California Department of Motor Vehicles confirmed that Apple is using a fleet of Lexus SUVs, which have since been spotted on the road, to test self-driving software. It's known that Apple's platform currently uses a Logitech wheel and pedals, and drivers can take over manually if necessary. Nevertheless, so-called Apple Maps vehicles could still be playing a role in the company's autonomous driving plans. Neil Cybart, an independent Apple analyst at Above Avalon, told MacRumors that Apple Maps vehicles are "very likely capturing mapping data," such as street level imagery, that will aid Apple's autonomous driving efforts. I don't think these Apple Maps vehicles are just meant to improve Apple Maps. Instead, my suspicion is they are part of Project Titan. Specifically, the vehicles are likely playing a role in building the groundwork for Apple's autonomous driving technology. The data collected by these vehicles may be used for testing autonomous driving technology using indoor simulation.Cybart, who confirmed seeing an Apple Maps vehicle in Connecticut earlier this week, said the mapping data collected could be a "foundation" for Apple's autonomous driving technology platform. Apple Maps vehicles are not autonomous cars. Instead, they are very likely capturing mapping data (i.e. imagery) that will aid Apple's autonomous driving efforts. My view is that this mapping data isn't just for Apple Maps Street View, which wouldn't be too useful, but rather for building a mapping foundation for Apple's autonomous driving technology platform.Connecticut and many other states that Apple has surveyed don't currently allow autonomous vehicle testing on their public roads, so Apple very likely is collecting data only, as it says. Whether that data is used for a Street View feature, autonomous driving software, or both, remains to be seen.

Rating: 2 Votes solipsism 3 hours ago at 08:46 pm Quite the utopian vision, and I admit that it sounds pretty amazing. However, we'll see how well this integrates over the next 100 years or so as one of the biggest challenges in the U.S. at least, is many states have fallen behind with serious road, bridge and highway infrastructure repairs and updates that are needed. Would imagine that automois system of the future will only work as well as local roadside conditions allow. I can see this in some major cities perhaps, but not everywhere. My statement is no more utopian than saying that the automobile will replace the horse and buggy as a more effective mode of transportation a century ago; and these are all natural steps to more automation, which you're surely very familiar with even without knowing it. The automatic transmission, anti-lock breaks, cruise control, adaptive cruise control, and the multitude of sensors that evaluate weight distribution, and traction, are just a few of the more prominent items that computers can monitor better than humans. Rating: 1 Votes solipsism 3 hours ago at 09:17 pm [USER=621566]@Col4bin[/USER] right regarding infrastructure. It's the one point you seem to be glossing over. The biggest impediment to autonomous driving is infrastructure. The roads have to be better. Right now in the US, the roads are quite crappy and as he mentioned, funding for improvements is sorely lacking. That doesn't even take into account all of the new infrastucture that will have to be created for full autonomy to be a reality. The streets will literally have to be as computerized as the cars. As for the cars, there will have to be standards set and followed by all car makers so that all the cars can actually communicate with each other. Every company's home brew is going to have to have that common communication ingredient. Otherwise, it ain't gonna work. cbefore the picture you've painted even has a chance to become a reality. 1) Since autonomous vehicles exist today it invalidates your entire claim that all those things will have to be changed before any advancement in autonomous driving will occur, not to mention previously statement advancements that have occurred over the last century. 2) There are hurdles with every advancement but you two are only seeing a mountain and saying "we can't step over that" instead of seeing how every step gets you a little closer to your destination. Again, this is happening right now whether you like it or not. Rating: 1 Votes Col4bin 3 hours ago at 08:36 pm 1) Autonomous vehicles are more efficient by nature than human drivers, hence they're more fuel efficient and reduce wear and tear. They can also drive closer together at a given speed—potentially without a traffic wave once vehicles are locally linked, which allows for even more vehicles to be placed on a road (as previously stated), which also helps increase efficiency through drafting. 2) I see nothing novel about automotive safety. 3) You have nothing to worry about. Technology will evolve at pace so there's no "if all cars were suddenly swapped" scenario to be concerned about. In a generation or two everyone will be scratching their head as to why old people thought they were better suited at handling a multi-tonne vehicle in a stressful situation over a multi-redundant system with dozens of sensor doing a billion or calculations a second without ever getting tired, distracted, rubbernecking, dealign with a bee in the car, changing the radio, a crying kid, a stressful day, and on and on and on. This is the future. Quite the utopian vision, and I admit that it sounds pretty amazing. However, we'll see how well this integrates over the next 100 years or so as one of the biggest challenges in the U.S. at least, is many states have fallen behind with serious road, bridge and highway infrastructure repairs and updates that are needed. Not to mention taxes are already high and public works funding is low. Would imagine that a fully autonomous system of the future will only work as well as local roadside conditions allow. I can see this evolving in some major cities perhaps, but not everywhere. So while it's certainly future-thinking, I don't think it will be a 100% reality for a very long time, if ever. Rating: 1 Votes Pakaku 3 hours ago at 09:08 pm Besides some Millennials and corporations who stand to potentially make billions of dollars on a potential reshaping of the automotive industry, who else is really that interested in self-driving cars, anyway? Seems like Apple and many others are doing what they can to force this change to grab a slice of the pie, to reap financial benefits. I think the people who should be interested (whether actually interested or not) would be people who can't drive, people who are unfit to drive, and in an indirect way, the people who have to put up with bad drivers on the road. Rating: 1 Votes Col4bin 4 hours ago at 08:14 pm I'm neither of those categories, and I'm all for safer driving that also reduces fuel/energy costs, reduces wear and tear, and allows for more current highways to allow for more traffic for the current time frames/ faster times with the current traffic. If autonomous self-driven cars were to suddenly populate the roadways tomorrow, not sure why there would be a reduction in fuel and energy costs, or a reduction in wear and tear (to roads, bridges or to vehicles as a whole?) You also realize that there wouldn't be a reduction to the amount of cars on the road either. If all cars were suddenly swapped with autonomously driven cars, plus further increasing the amount of vehicles on the road due to many companies "cashing in" on autonomously driven car services, the number will greatly increase. The most novel idea here is one of safety, but it will be a long time yet before that is guaranteed. While overall your sentiments are novel and heroic, and we appreciate your sacrifice for mankind, my guess is that you currently live in a heavily populated area and either use public transportation on a daily basis, or ride a bike to get around, making your decision an easy one? Be honest.

Lots of people die and get severely injured in car accidents, mainly because they are distracted, tired, sleepy or even drunk. Lots of people need their mobility but they can't, because they are handicapped, too old to drive, suffering disease, too young to drive, etc. But yeah, it's just people that want to make money… those capitalist pig-dogs!

But a modern smartphone, with a beefy processor and a decent-sized display, can do almost everything the Nintendo Switch can (sadly Breath of the Wild will still be out of your reach). What We Know About The Nintendo Switch's Garbage Graphics The Nintendo Switch looks like it might be complete weaksauce when compared to the best consoles from Sony and Microsoft. But the real question is. Does that matter? Probably not. Read more In fact, your smartphone might actually offer a few upgrades over the Switch! There are far more games available, including emulators that let you play classic titles from almost any console. Though you'll need to put in a little effort if you want to play old Zelda games on your iPhone. Besides games, your phone almost certainly offers a better visual experience than the Switch does. Nintendo chose to use an LCD display limited to a resolution of just 1280x720 pixels and many smartphones are capable of at least full 1920x1080 HD resolutions with colour saturation and fidelity that far outperform the Switch's screen. But having access to thousands of great titles on a beautiful screen means nothing when trying to play action games using a touchscreen. Ask anyone who's tried, it is an act of absolute frustration. Controllers So the first upgrade you'll need to turn your smartphone into a Switch are some better controls. After all, touchscreens suck when it comes to playing games that require more than just tapping the screen. With the right accessories you can almost perfectly emulate the Switch's handheld gaming experience, or connect multiple wireless controllers for some mobile multiplayer. Switch Style Controllers Gamevice Controller (iOS) The closest you'll get to recreating the Nintendo Switch's form factor is the $150 Gamevice that wraps your smartphone in a pair of halved controllers featuring analogue joysticks, a directional pad and a set of four action buttons. You'll at least need an iPhone 6 to use it, but it connects to the device's Lightning port without the need for battery-sucking Bluetooth. MOGA Ace Power Controller (iOS) It's essentially the same product as the Gamevice, but the MOGA Ace Power packs a rechargeable battery to help keep your smartphone running longer, but it's only compatible with older iPhones. Anything larger than the iPhone 5s will be too big for the MOGA Ace Power to wrap around. Australian stock is hard to come by, but you can always hit up eBay, where prices start at $34 (including postage). 8Bitdo Zero Controller (iOS & Android) The Switch's two controllers handily slide off either end of the console to be used for multiplayer experiences, and if you want a similarly super tiny controller for your iOS or Android device than maybe you should consider the $30 8Bitdo Zero. It works with any device that can wirelessly connect to Bluetooth peripherals and offers basic controls including shoulder buttons, a directional pad, and four action buttons. Switch Pro Style Controllers SteelSeries Stratus XL Controller (Android) We're a big fan of SteelSeries, so while the $89 SteelSeries Stratus XL isn't ideal for travelling, we still think it's a good choice for when your smartphone's connected to a TV for big-screen gaming. It's not as cool as a Switch controller but its a comparable alternative to the Nintendo Switch's Pro Controller. And while it doesn't have any force feedback features, it does promise 40 hours of gameplay on a single pair of AA batteries. SteelSeries Nimbus Controller (iOS) The $100 SteelSeries Nimbus wireless controller is the iOS equivalent of the company's Stratus XL, giving you essentially the same experience as the full-size Nintendo Switch Pro Controller. With a few bonuses: It can be charged using the same Lightning cable you plug your iPhone into every night and it features a dedicated menu button for navigating iOS or your Apple TV. 8Bitdo Wireless NES & SNES Controllers (iOS & Android) The Nintendo Switch will inevitably get access to the company's Virtual Console, letting you play your favourite classic games. But with a smartphone running an emulator you can play them all now. And with 8Bitdo's $53 NES and SNES Bluetooth controllers, near-perfect recreations of the originals, you might feel like you're back in your parent's basement, slamming cans of Passiona while playing Super Mario World. Video Adapters One of the Nintendo Switch's most unique features is its ability to transform from a handheld gaming system to a part of your entertainment center so you can play your games on a big screen TV. The Switch relies on a cumbersome dock to do this, but there are more elegant ways to connect your smartphone to a TV, including going wireless. There are pros and cons to each approach, however, so you'll need to decide what works best for you. Going wireless means you don't have to deal with your smartphone being tethered to a long HDMI cable. But it might mean some costly hardware upgrades if you don't already have a reliable wireless network in your home, or a TV setup that facilitates streaming from a mobile device. Using a video adaptor physically connected to your TV means you'll have to wrangle HDMI and charging cables while you play. Yet it also guarantees smooth frame rates at all times, and the ability to enjoy your games on a friend's TV, or a TV in a hotel room, where you can't easily connect to a reliable (or secure) wireless network. The Wireless Options Apple TV (iOS) If you want to wirelessly connect your iPhone to your TV using AirPlay, the Apple TV is your easiest solution. However, at $239 it's half the price of a Nintendo Switch and you'll need to ensure your wireless router is up to the task of streaming video to your TV without dropping frames, which can ruin the gaming experience. Google Chromecast (Android) Chromcast can with iPhones games streamed to the TV too, but the experience isn't always pleasant. Yet, for mirroring the gaming action on your Android smartphone to a TV, using a Google Chromecast is the way to go. Its small and unobtrusive and is only $59. That's a downright bargain — as long as you can live with resolutions that top out at 1920x1080 HD. Google Chromecast Ultra (Android) Can the Nintendo Switch do 4K? Nope. But your Android smartphone probably can when connected to your TV via the Google Chromecast Ultra. It goes $99 — just ten dollars more than a Switch game and it has an ethernet port for connecting directly to your router. That should help take some of the load off of your wireless network to ensure solid frame rates when streaming your favourite games. The Wired Options Apple Lightning Digital AV Adaptor (iOS) Reliable wired options for iOS devices are few and far between. If you're using an iPhone your best bet is to shell out a few more bucks to Apple and buy the $75 official Lightning to HDMI adaptor. Fortunately it also includes an additional USB-C port so you can power your device while it's connected to a TV using its Lightning port. MicroUSB to HDMI Adaptor (Android) If you're using an older Android device that doesn't have a USB-C connection, you'll need this microUSB to HDMI adaptor. You probably won't be able to push 4K resolution games to your TV, but at $8 it's a cheap and compact solution. Apple USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adaptor (Android) The iPhone doesn't support USB-C just yet, but most of the Android smartphones released in the past year do. As do many laptops. So Apple's USB-C to HDMI adaptor might be worth the $109 investment. When you're not using it to connect an Android smartphone to your TV for gaming, it also has a USB-A port for connecting older peripherals to your fancy new laptop. Games This is where your makeshift smartphone Switch can run laps around Nintendo's console — at least in terms of selection. At the moment, the best reasons to buy a Nintendo Switch are Zelda: Breath of the Wild, and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. That's just two games. They both happen to be very good games, but the iTunes App Store and the Google Play store both have thousands of titles you can download, and plenty that are actually good. But which platform offers the better gaming experience? Apple's walled garden approach to its app store means you're less likely to get fooled buying a knock-off game. Its MFi certification program also ensures that if a controller says 'Made for iPhone' on the packaging, it's guaranteed to connect and work with your phone right out of the box. Not all iOS games will work with a MFi-approved controller, however, and using a generic Bluetooth gamepad with your iPhone is hit and miss. Android smartphones, on the other hand, have access to the Google Play store, which is like the wild west when it comes to content. Anything and everything goes, and you can probably find exactly what you need if you know where to look. That includes games, apps for remapping the buttons on a Bluetooth controller so it works flawlessly with any title, and emulators. Part of the appeal of recent Nintendo consoles has been the company's Virtual Console which allows you to play classic NES, SNES, and Game Boy games on modern hardware. But with the right emulator, Android smartphones can play classic games from countless different consoles, including the Atari 2600, Playstation, Game Boy Advance, PSP, PS2 and even the Game Cube. As for finding those games (commonly referred to as ROMs) that's between you and a strategic Google search. How To Build Your Own Mini SNES The NES Classic Edition is almost perfect — short controller cords not withstanding — and if you can buy one, it's one of our favourite gifts, especially if you don't want to leave the house. But it only plays NES games, and 30 games at that. Plenty of people — us included — would love a tiny system to play our favourite Super Nintendo games. Or Genesis games. Read more Can you play games like Zelda: Breath of the Wild or Mario Kart 8 Deluxe on your smartphone yet? No. So the Nintendo Switch will always be able to hold that over your smartphone FrankenSwitch. But you just saved yourself $US300+ ($404)+, and having to wait in yet another line hoping that Best Buy has restocked enough of them. WATCH MORE: Gaming News Comments Join the discussion!

Adobe software has always been expensive, but at least it was one upfront cost. As it turns out, we were right. Another annual price increase for Creative Cloud is happening a month from now, and it represents the latest jump in a nearly 250 per cent price rise for some Creative Cloud plans since it started.

Skip to main content asia one Singapore Malaysia China Asia World Singapore Malaysia China Asia World Business Showbiz Health Food Why Apple loves Yeay, the teenage app that is the Snapchat of shopping The Yeay App PHOTO: CNBC Lucy Handley CNBC May 07, 2017 How does Apple find out about the future? Ask a teenager, of course. Snapchat-style teen shopping app Yeay only came out of beta development three months ago, but Apple execs have already been to its Berlin office to understand more about its audience of ten to 20 year-olds. Yeay is a "social shopping" app, which lets users make and upload videos to sell products, largely fashion and lifestyle goods, and has been described as "QVC + Tumblr + Snapchat" by tech blog Product Hunt. "Our app is a utility app, it helps everyone create good product videos. At the same time, it's a platform where these product videos can immediately transform into transaction videos and people can immediately purchase on our platform," Yeay founder Melanie Mohr told CNBC. "You could say it's a marketplace, but at the same place an entertainment platform combined with many social factors, and I think this is what, especially when you are looking into this generation, this is what they want, they want to be social, they want to share products," Mohr added. The core group of buyers and sellers on the app is aged 12 to 18, and they are an entrepreneurial bunch. "They want to create products, and they want to make money," said Mohr. Yeay doesn't take commission from individuals who sell via the app, but plans to charge larger brands an undisclosed percentage, from 2018. Apple's future consumers Apple got interested in the app because of the insights it can give into the next generation of shoppers, Mohr said. "We had delegations from Apple in our office… There are many ways our product is quite interesting to them, but I think that they are also looking into trends and they saw this is the kind of trend-capturing platform, and this Gen Z focus is something they are highly focused [on]." Yeay also has versions for Apple's iMessage app, and is working on an Apple TV version. Users can set up a wish list within the Yeay app and share it with friends who can see it via the app store within iMessage. Big agencies and brands are also interested because of the insights Yeay can give them, as well as how to create videos and other content teens want to like and share. "They want to have access to our user-generated content and to this tool within the app to create [it]… such as product video challenges and campaigns." The most searched-for brand on Yeay is Yeezy, Kanye West's fashion line, followed by Supreme, the hip New York street wear label, but people also sell goods they've made or sourced themselves. So far nearly $2 million-worth of transactions have been made in three months, the app has 100,000 registered users from 160 countries and is available in 18 languages. The US, UK and the rest of Europe are its hotspots, and it is working with Veon (formerly VimpelCom), the Russian telco that has more than 200 million customers, on an integration for its WeChat-like messaging application that will have a "zero data policy," (so users won't incur data charges) Mohr said. Shopping stars It's easy to compare Yeay to Ebay as a marketplace and Snapchat as a social network, especially as it added filters and stickers last month, but Mohr prefers to liken it to Musical.ly, the app where teens lip-synch along to their favourite hits, gaining millions of followers along the way, because "people love to have this feeling that they could be the next music star, or behave like their favourite star." With Yeay, they can become a star of selling. The teens selling on the app differ from their older Millennial counterparts because they are natural and unselfconscious, says Mohr. "They know how to create good content and they know how to message it right to their crowd on other social platforms."

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 7 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Apple announces environmental progress in China Lens Technology has committed to power all of its glass production for Apple with 100 percent renewable energy by the end of 2018, as part of Apple’s industry-leading supply chain clean energy program announced last year. Lens is the first supplier to make a clean energy commitment for all of its Apple production, and will meet its goal through an unprecedented power purchase agreement with local wind projects. Apple is working with suppliers to help transform the environmental landscape in China, and is proud to announce all 14 of its final assembly sites in China are now compliant with UL’s Zero Waste to Landfill validation. The UL standard certifies all of their manufacturing waste is reused, recycled, composted, or, when necessary, converted into energy. Since the program began in January 2015, the sites have diverted more than 140,000 metric tons of waste from landfills. “We want to show the world that you can manufacture responsibly and we’re working alongside our suppliers to help them lower their environmental impact in China,” said Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives. “We congratulate Lens for their bold step, and hope by sharing the lessons we’ve learned in our transition to renewable energy, our suppliers will continue to access clean power projects, moving China closer to its green manufacturing goals.” “Our power purchase agreement is the first of its kind in southern China and we hope it will serve as an example for other companies looking to transition to cleaner, more economical sources of power,” said Lens CEO Zhou Qunfei. “We’re pleased to be the first supplier to commit to covering all of our Apple production with renewable energy, and proud to source from local Hunan wind farms to power our facilities in Changsha.” Lens’ manufacturing with Apple currently includes two facilities in Changsha, Hunan province. Wind energy will cover 100 percent of the energy consumed producing Apple products at Lens facilities by 2018, avoiding nearly 450,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide each year, equivalent to the energy use in 380,000 Chinese homes.

Can Consumer Wi-Fi Be a New Growth Driver? Formerly enterprise and online-only, Ubiquiti is bringing its newest product to a brick-and-mortar retailer near you. Billy Duberstein (Dubs82) May 6, 2017 at 6:36PM One of the hardest things to value in a company are future products and markets. For instance, who could have predicted Amazon would become a leader in IT infrastructure back in 2000? Or that Apple would be a phone-maker, back in the 90s? However, it is precisely these types of less predictable innovations that can lead to Amazon and Apple-like returns. Lesser-known Ubiquiti Networks (NASDAQ:UBNT) recently rolled out a new business segment, and it's coming to a retail store near you. If you haven't heard of the company, that is because it is mostly known for its high-performance radios that form the backbone of WISP networks (wireless internet service providers). In more rural parts of the U.S. and emerging markets, service providers are selling broadband wirelessly via Ubiquiti's radios. In 2011, Ubiquiti ventured inside small businesses and schools with its Unifi product -- its line of enterprise-grade access points, switches, and routers. That segment has been a huge success, posting 87% year over year gains last quarter, and it is now almost as big as the service provider segment. Next up: Amplifi In 2016, Ubiquiti entered the consumer home Wi-Fi market with its next new product line called Amplifi. Amplifi's mesh-Wi-Fi system is geared to give your home enterprise-grade Wi-Fi speeds and fill pesky dead spots, all at consumer prices. This type of home solution had previously been the realm of low-cost consumer routers made by Netgear or Google, but these days, greater capability is need to handle the increased data requirements for connected home devices and video streaming. Therefore, Ubiquiti thought consumers might now have use for its high-powered technology. With the consumer in mind, the company constructed the router to look cool, with a blue-light touchscreen, and also made the system very easy to set up. Owners can set up a network in minutes, easily add or drop devices to their networks, and check network speeds all from the easy-to-use app. source: Amplifi.com Last week, Ubiquiti announced that Amplifi would now be available at Sam's Club, Best Buy, and Gamestop. Despite being unveiled a year ago , Amplifi was only previously available via Amazon or the Amplifi online Store. The reason for the hold-up lies in Ubiquiti's ultra-lean business model. The company does little to no sales or marketing efforts, instead utilizing its online community where tech-savvy enterprise customers can commiserate the lack of availability of its devices, then only ramping up volumes when demand is assured. The average consumer is much less savvy. So, instead of rolling the product out nationwide and risking an inventory buildup, the company sold product first through its own store, then the largest online destination, Amazon, in conjunction with an initial PR rollout. Now, the company is ready to get the product in front of people in a physical store. In many ways, this will be the ultimate test as to whether consumers will snatch up these advanced offerings. Sam's Club is part of Wal-Mart, still the largest retailer in the U.S. by a wide margin. Despite years of revenue declines, Best Buy is still the leading electronics retailer in North America, and could be boosted further by bankruptcies among rivals. It also has the all-important Geek Squad, which can educate laymen about mesh networks. The most interesting placement is in Gamestop. Gamers require very high speeds, so Ubiquiti is making a statement that these high-end applications require its high-end technology. Will Amplifi move the needle? Right now, Amplifi is lumped in with Ubiquiti's Unifi segment when the company reports revenues, due to the segment being new. If the new retail push can gain traction, it could become material, especially if the glowing reviews like this from App Advice are any indication of consumer sentiment.  A system consisting of the main router and two mesh points ranges anywhere from the standard $199 system to the $349 HD system. Users can also buy the router or mesh points separately. Assuming the company can sell 100,000 systems per year, that would equate to around $30 million, which would be about 4% of current revenues. However, it is likely Ubiquiti will expand internationally if the product sells well in the years to come, and establishing the brand may also allow the company to follow with more products for the Internet of Things and increasingly, the connected home. As Amazon and Apple taught us with cloud computing and the iPhone, entirely new products can sometimes be even more material than older core businesses. Investors should keep an eye on how Amplifi catches on this year. Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Engst We’re approaching another of those inflection points where Apple leaves some apps — and their users — behind. When you launched an older 32-bit app in iOS 10, it first warned that the app might slow down your device. That was, as far as I could tell, not the case, but it was still disconcerting. With iOS 10.3, however, Apple went further, stating in no uncertain terms that the app would stop working with some future version of iOS. As to when that will be, there’s no telling, but iOS 11 would seem to be likely. The iPhone 5s was the first iPhone with a 64-bit processor, and since it shipped in September 2013, developers have had the option to have their apps run in 64-bit mode. Starting in 2015, Apple has required apps to run in 64-bit mode to receive App Store approval. The practical upshot of Apple’s iOS warnings is that most apps that haven’t been updated since 2015 will likely be rendered inoperable by whatever future version of iOS pulls the plug on 32-bit apps. I can’t imagine that there will be any way to keep running such apps, short of refusing to update to that version of iOS. In iOS 10.3, Apple made it possible to see which of your apps will be affected. Navigate to Settings > General > About > Applications. The number next to Applications is the total number of apps installed, but when you tap Applications to see what’s inside, you see a list of 32-bit apps that have no updates available. Tap any app to see its listing in the App Store, from which you can tap through to the developer’s Web site and theoretically ask if there will be an update. In most cases, the answer will likely be no. To bring that question home to roost, what about the TidBITS News app? The answer is, you guessed it, no, we will not be updating it. Written by Matt Neuburg and last updated in January 2013 for iOS 6, the TidBITS News app simply isn’t used by many people, and most of those who are using it have updated to iOS 10. As you can see in the stats for April 2017, fewer than 50 people per day are using it. It should continue to work in current versions of iOS for now. At its heart, TidBITS News is just an RSS reader dedicated to TidBITS, so you can easily replace it with Apple’s built-in News app. To add TidBITS to your Favorites list in News, search for TidBITS in News and either tap the heart icon next to the appropriate search result, or tap the search result itself and then the heart icon in the upper right corner. From then on, just tap Favorites in the News toolbar and then the TidBITS tile to see all our articles. If you want to add an RSS feed to News but can’t find it with a search from within News, you can use Safari. Navigate to the Web site in question, tap the share icon, and then tap Open in News in the share sheet. Once you’re in News, tap the name at the top of the screen to go to the main article list, and tap the heart button there. You can, of course, use any other RSS reader too, but only TidBITS members get access to the full-text RSS feed for use in other apps. If you are a TidBITS member, access the full-text feed by logging in and clicking the RSS link in the upper left of our Web site.   PDFpen and PDFpenPro 9 add 100+ enhancements to improve your PDF editing experience, with annotations, Tables of Contents, and more export options.

Your comment will appear after you follow a link in the one-time confirmation message we send to verify that you're a real person. The writing is on the wall for 32-bit iOS apps that haven’t seen updates in years — they will stop working in a future version of iOS. That includes the TidBITS News app that a few people still use. Happily, you can easily replace it with any RSS reader, including Apple’s built-in News app. Receive comments via RSS Add a comment James Atkinson  2017-05-05 11:04 I appear to be one of the 50 daily users and have appreciated having a one-stop shop for TidBits content. Thank you for stepping through the Apple News/RSS alternative, which I'll do today. Farewell, TidBits News app! Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 11:11 Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but Apple's News app should work just fine for you. Reply david cuddy   2017-05-05 13:17 Not if you're in Canada. The iOS News app still isn't available here. Probably because we don't have 'Fake News'. Oddly, the News widget does appear on my Today page, and the -1 Home page. But there's no way to control the sources of the news feeds it uses. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 13:22 Still? Sheesh... sorry about that. Reeder or Feedly should work in that case. Reply Frans Moquette  2017-05-05 18:41 I seem to be one of the 50 also, but also no Apple News app on my iPad. I'm in The Netherlands (aka Holland). I do have Newsify, will that work? Otherwise, back to reading with Safari? Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 19:06 I haven't used Newsify, but from what I see on their product page, yes, it should work. Just get the RSS feed URL from the RSS link in the upper left of our Web site (full text for TidBITS members). Safari's Reader view does a pretty good job too for individual articles. Reply Lewis Butler   2017-05-05 11:20 How it was explained to me is that iOS 10 doesn't load 32 bit libraries until it has to, so running a 32-bit app can easily slow down your entire device depending on how much memory you have and how much you switch apps. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 11:24 Could be, but in practice, I never noticed any change after running such an app on my iPhone 7. Perhaps it had sufficient RAM and CPU power to mask any slowdowns. Reply Martin Stoermer  2017-05-05 11:37 Quite a few paid apps on my phone are marked as being on this scrap heap. Some have new versions available with a new name for new $, which I'm a bit grumpy about. In the case of the free ones it's a bit bit annoying but meh. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 11:41 I totally understand and empathize with the irritation of needing to buy new apps, but you should lay that blame squarely at Apple's feet, since they created a situation where developers have no choice but to chase new sales instead of supporting loyal customers. If developers were allowed to charge for upgrades, there would be financial incentive to keep up with existing apps. Reply Frans Moquette  2017-05-05 19:01 I agree. With non-paid updates/upgrades Apple has done developers a big disservice. But not only developers, users also. When you have to switch to a new app, you cannot acces your data in the old app, unless the data is in a cloud storage or the developer has provided a way to transfer it. If the old app does not work anymore on the new OS, you would loose all your data if you were not able to transfer it before the app stopped working Not a great user experience I would think, for which only Apple is to blame. Reply Christopher Smith  2017-05-05 19:33 While I can certainly understand that developers wish they could charge for upgrades (and why it incentivizes improvements to apps), it seems to me that allowing one's app to languish into obsolescence will definitely inhibit future sales. Reply Frans Moquette  2017-05-06 05:19 I agree with that too. Thing is, all products follow an S-shaped growth curve. Older product will be in the top of that curve with little to no new sales. The effort needed to update an older product often does not warrant the revenue from new sales, if any. Reply JohnB (SciFiOne)   2017-05-05 13:43 I knew Glyder would stop working some day. Oh well. But it will be a while yet since I gave up and now only update software and hardware when I have to. Not as secure, but less expensive and so much easier (except that I make even more offline backups to be safe). Reply Anonymous  2017-05-05 14:55 What I would like to comment on is have an iPhone 4s iPad 4/128 both still running iOS 9.3.5. I have been reluctant to move the iPad to iOS 10, I keep erasing the software update (hanging in storage) because of the tricks Apple keeps trying to make me update the iPad 4. Since I have a fixed income and cannot see sense in a new iPhone 5s or 4SE that are 64bit and I haven't been won over with possibilities iOS 10, and without possible compatibility between devices. So this is what I am wondering? 1.What if I update one but not the other, anyone with insight or expertise foresee problems between iProducts? 2.This is in reference to the below info (under FYI), if I update the iPad to 10, I know I cannot go back is it worth it. Any help? 3.Since this is a sandbox world closing in, is it time to just freeze my technology now before it made useless by having to afford the latest and greatest Apple product (or Microsoft)every 2-5 years? Just an FYI: Also my two Mac Pros are is similar place one a 2006/8 2,1 I upgrade the hardware my self to an 8-core so I frozen myself to 10.9.5 world with (64on32) and the used 2010 5,1 model can run 10.11 or 10.12 which seem to iffy, with all the beta crashing of Sierra I had.. At least I can roll back to my macOS of choice 10.9.5 on a different boot drive of the Mac Pro 5,1. ~Barry Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 16:45 It's hard to make concrete recommendations without knowing all the details, but it sounds like it might make sense to keep iOS 9.3.5 on both your devices, particularly if that matches with your Mac Pros and the equivalent version of iTunes (honestly, I don't know what versions match up offhand). If you start upgrading things piecemeal, you will end up in a situation where something won't talk to something else, but it's hard to predict how that will happen. The main thing to be aware of is that you aren't getting security updates, so you should be extra careful to avoid dodgy parts of the Internet. At some point, some hardware will probably fail and force you to get something new, and that may be the event that encourages upgrading everything to the latest and greatest. Reply David Morrison   2017-05-05 22:14 There is definitely a problem with upgrading iDevices if you connect them to a Mac and the Mac is not running a very recent version of OS X. Basically, older versions of iTunes will not talk to newer versions of IOS. What you get is a dialogue every time you plug in the device telling you this and advising you to upgrade iTunes - very annoying, since newer versions of iTunes will not run on older versions of OS X! So say you are running OS X 10.8 with iTunes 12. Your iDevices are running IOS 9.3.5. This works fine. You then decide to upgrade to IOS 10 on a device. If you try to do it through iTunes, it will say you need to upgrade iTunes - this warning is pretty vague, and does not raise any alarms. Unfortunately, iTunes 12 is the last version that will run on OS X 10.8. So your only option is to upgrade OS X which may not be acceptable. So you upgrade the device to IOS 10 over the Internet directly. Then plug it in to your Mac and get a warning from iTunes that it cannot talk to the device. Oops! No more backups of your device. No copying data files from apps to your Mac. No managing apps on your Mac. What does work is that iPhoto will still transfer photos, and probably Image Capture too. Third party file access apps on the Mac can also access the device. It seems to just be iTunes that does not work. Beware also that if you buy a new iDevice, it will not work with iTunes on your old Mac either. Sadly there is definitely no going back after the upgrade. You are stuck with IOS 10. Reply Derek Roff   2017-05-05 16:23 "The number next to Applications is the total number of apps installed, but when you tap Applications to see what’s inside, you see a list of 32-bit apps that have no updates available. " I'm not seeing exactly what you describe in the article, on my iPad 4 with iOS 10.3.1. When I tap on Applications, I see the number of apps (100), and "inside", I see the text you list about "These apps may slow down your iPad...". No app names appear directly below that. Then I see in grey text "Updates available". Below that are app names, including apps that I upgraded today. I haven't counted, but I think all 100 apps might appear in this group. This includes major apps like App Store, Remote, FaceTime, Google, YouTube, Amazon Prime Video, Dropbox, etc. It doesn't make sense to me that these are all 32-bit applications, but it's likely that some of the apps I have installed are. I haven't been able to guess the ordering system for this list. It isn't alphabetical. It isn't by age, install date, or most recent update. Tapping an arrow next to most apps will take me to the App Store, and show me that no update is available. A few say that the app is not available in the App Store. Below the last app on this list is grey text saying "No Updates Available". There are no apps listed under these words. Can you give us a few more words about this app list, and how to interpret the groupings and ordering? Thanks. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 16:41 My best guess is that it's confused. :-) What I'd try is going to the App Store app, making sure that everything is updated, and then restart the iPhone (hold down both buttons until it restarts). Reply Derek Roff   2017-05-05 17:15 Thanks for your response, Adam. A restart changed nothing for me, and the App Store shows no updates available. I guess I will wait and see what happens with the next iOS upgrade. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 17:17 The other thing you could try is signing out in Settings > iTunes & App Stores. Then sign back in and see if it has figured things out better. Reply Timothy Pearson  2017-05-05 16:22 Reading TidBITS in Apple News doesn't work for me. Following your prescription, I added it to my favorites; but it only shows one article since 3 October 2016, and several unrelated articles about "Tidbits" from other sites. If the iOS app stops working, I guess I will have to use the webpage instead. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 16:47 It sounds like your search hit "Tidbits" as a topic, rather than "TidBITS" as the publication. Try again, and make sure the one you're selecting has our capitalization. Tap it, and make sure it's our content, then tap the heart icon at the top right. Reply brent  2017-05-05 18:18 thanks guys! guess i wasn't the only one to ask, lol. i liked the app, really just to catch specific articles i see noted in FB or tweets. but the apple news will do. irony, i had never used apple news until now. keep up the good work, you are still my "go to" resource. Reply Roland G  2017-05-05 19:28 I'm an iOS developer since 2009. I have updated many apps to support 64bit and it really isn't a big deal. The developers of these apps just need to update their apps to support both 32/64 and all is well. At some point Apple needs to move on with their OS and I fully support that. If you don't want to update to 11, don't update, simple as that. Reply David Morrison   2017-05-05 22:24 I use the app occasionally, when in waiting rooms or travelling, but generally prefer the weekly roundup that arrives by e-mail. That said, I prefer the app's layout to News. News just shows the first few lines of each article to give you an idea of what it is about. This is often not helpful. In the app, there is a paragraph summarising the article, which often meant you did not even have to read the article if it was not of interest - a huge time saver. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-06 18:49 Hmm, I see what you mean — Apple News doesn't provide our blurb, just the first few lines of the article. I don't think there's any way to do that in News with an RSS feed. It might be possible with Apple News Format, but that's a whole 'nother ball of development wax. :-) Reply David Morrison   2017-05-05 22:31 I am having trouble adding the member version of the RSS feed. I logged in with Safari and clicked on RSS feed. It asked me if I wanted to open it in News. I said yes, then it told me the story could not be found. Tidbits does not appear in the favourites list. Going back to repeat this process, when I click on RSS, I get a message from Safari: Cannot open page Safari cannot open the page because the address is invalid. Any ideas? Reply David Morrison   2017-05-05 22:35 I quit News, and started again. Safari asked if I wanted to open the link in News. I said Yes. It showed the list of headlines, then said: Story unavailable. This story is not available in News. Given that I had not touched a story, this is mystifying….. Reply David Morrison   2017-05-05 22:37 Even though Tidbits is not listed in Favourites, the Tidbits news items are still being shown….. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-06 18:35 Can you just add it from the search in News? That's generally easier and will give the same result. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-06 18:50 What's weird is that it's working for me in Safari with no problems. Are you logged into the TidBITS site when you start adding? That might make a difference.

When you launched an older 32-bit app in iOS 10, it first warned that the app might slow down your device. That was, as far as I could tell, not the case, but it was still disconcerting. With iOS 10.3, however, Apple went further, stating in no uncertain terms that the app would stop working with some future version of iOS. As to when that will be, there’s no telling, but iOS 11 would seem to be likely. The iPhone 5s was the first iPhone with a 64-bit processor, and since it shipped in September 2013, developers have had the option to have their apps run in 64-bit mode. Starting in 2015, Apple has required apps to run in 64-bit mode to receive App Store approval. The practical upshot of Apple’s iOS warnings is that most apps that haven’t been updated since 2015 will likely be rendered inoperable by whatever future version of iOS pulls the plug on 32-bit apps. I can’t imagine that there will be any way to keep running such apps, short of refusing to update to that version of iOS. In iOS 10.3, Apple made it possible to see which of your apps will be affected. Navigate to Settings > General > About > Applications. The number next to Applications is the total number of apps installed, but when you tap Applications to see what’s inside, you see a list of 32-bit apps that have no updates available. Tap any app to see its listing in the App Store, from which you can tap through to the developer’s Web site and theoretically ask if there will be an update. In most cases, the answer will likely be no. To bring that question home to roost, what about the TidBITS News app? The answer is, you guessed it, no, we will not be updating it. Written by Matt Neuburg and last updated in January 2013 for iOS 6, the TidBITS News app simply isn’t used by many people, and most of those who are using it have updated to iOS 10. As you can see in the stats for April 2017, fewer than 50 people per day are using it. It should continue to work in current versions of iOS for now. At its heart, TidBITS News is just an RSS reader dedicated to TidBITS, so you can easily replace it with Apple’s built-in News app. To add TidBITS to your Favorites list in News, search for TidBITS in News and either tap the heart icon next to the appropriate search result, or tap the search result itself and then the heart icon in the upper right corner. From then on, just tap Favorites in the News toolbar and then the TidBITS tile to see all our articles. If you want to add an RSS feed to News but can’t find it with a search from within News, you can use Safari. Navigate to the Web site in question, tap the share icon, and then tap Open in News in the share sheet. Once you’re in News, tap the name at the top of the screen to go to the main article list, and tap the heart button there. You can, of course, use any other RSS reader too, but only TidBITS members get access to the full-text RSS feed for use in other apps. If you are a TidBITS member, access the full-text feed by logging in and clicking the RSS link in the upper left of our Web site.   PDFpen and PDFpenPro 9 add 100+ enhancements to improve your PDF editing experience, with annotations, Tables of Contents, and more export options.

Thank you for stepping through the Apple News/RSS alternative, which I'll do today. Farewell, TidBits News app! Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 11:11 Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but Apple's News app should work just fine for you. Reply david cuddy   2017-05-05 13:17 Not if you're in Canada. The iOS News app still isn't available here. Probably because we don't have 'Fake News'. Oddly, the News widget does appear on my Today page, and the -1 Home page. But there's no way to control the sources of the news feeds it uses. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 13:22 Still? Sheesh... sorry about that. Reeder or Feedly should work in that case. Reply Frans Moquette  2017-05-05 18:41 I seem to be one of the 50 also, but also no Apple News app on my iPad. I'm in The Netherlands (aka Holland). I do have Newsify, will that work? Otherwise, back to reading with Safari? Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 19:06 I haven't used Newsify, but from what I see on their product page, yes, it should work. Just get the RSS feed URL from the RSS link in the upper left of our Web site (full text for TidBITS members). Safari's Reader view does a pretty good job too for individual articles. Reply Lewis Butler   2017-05-05 11:20 How it was explained to me is that iOS 10 doesn't load 32 bit libraries until it has to, so running a 32-bit app can easily slow down your entire device depending on how much memory you have and how much you switch apps. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 11:24 Could be, but in practice, I never noticed any change after running such an app on my iPhone 7. Perhaps it had sufficient RAM and CPU power to mask any slowdowns. Reply Martin Stoermer  2017-05-05 11:37 Quite a few paid apps on my phone are marked as being on this scrap heap. Some have new versions available with a new name for new $, which I'm a bit grumpy about. In the case of the free ones it's a bit bit annoying but meh. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 11:41 I totally understand and empathize with the irritation of needing to buy new apps, but you should lay that blame squarely at Apple's feet, since they created a situation where developers have no choice but to chase new sales instead of supporting loyal customers. If developers were allowed to charge for upgrades, there would be financial incentive to keep up with existing apps. Reply Frans Moquette  2017-05-05 19:01 I agree. With non-paid updates/upgrades Apple has done developers a big disservice. But not only developers, users also. When you have to switch to a new app, you cannot acces your data in the old app, unless the data is in a cloud storage or the developer has provided a way to transfer it. If the old app does not work anymore on the new OS, you would loose all your data if you were not able to transfer it before the app stopped working Not a great user experience I would think, for which only Apple is to blame. Reply Christopher Smith  2017-05-05 19:33 While I can certainly understand that developers wish they could charge for upgrades (and why it incentivizes improvements to apps), it seems to me that allowing one's app to languish into obsolescence will definitely inhibit future sales. Reply Frans Moquette  2017-05-06 05:19 I agree with that too. Thing is, all products follow an S-shaped growth curve. Older product will be in the top of that curve with little to no new sales. The effort needed to update an older product often does not warrant the revenue from new sales, if any. Reply JohnB (SciFiOne)   2017-05-05 13:43 I knew Glyder would stop working some day. Oh well. But it will be a while yet since I gave up and now only update software and hardware when I have to. Not as secure, but less expensive and so much easier (except that I make even more offline backups to be safe). Reply Anonymous  2017-05-05 14:55 What I would like to comment on is have an iPhone 4s iPad 4/128 both still running iOS 9.3.5. I have been reluctant to move the iPad to iOS 10, I keep erasing the software update (hanging in storage) because of the tricks Apple keeps trying to make me update the iPad 4. Since I have a fixed income and cannot see sense in a new iPhone 5s or 4SE that are 64bit and I haven't been won over with possibilities iOS 10, and without possible compatibility between devices. So this is what I am wondering? 1.What if I update one but not the other, anyone with insight or expertise foresee problems between iProducts? 2.This is in reference to the below info (under FYI), if I update the iPad to 10, I know I cannot go back is it worth it. Any help? 3.Since this is a sandbox world closing in, is it time to just freeze my technology now before it made useless by having to afford the latest and greatest Apple product (or Microsoft)every 2-5 years? Just an FYI: Also my two Mac Pros are is similar place one a 2006/8 2,1 I upgrade the hardware my self to an 8-core so I frozen myself to 10.9.5 world with (64on32) and the used 2010 5,1 model can run 10.11 or 10.12 which seem to iffy, with all the beta crashing of Sierra I had.. At least I can roll back to my macOS of choice 10.9.5 on a different boot drive of the Mac Pro 5,1. ~Barry Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 16:45 It's hard to make concrete recommendations without knowing all the details, but it sounds like it might make sense to keep iOS 9.3.5 on both your devices, particularly if that matches with your Mac Pros and the equivalent version of iTunes (honestly, I don't know what versions match up offhand). If you start upgrading things piecemeal, you will end up in a situation where something won't talk to something else, but it's hard to predict how that will happen. The main thing to be aware of is that you aren't getting security updates, so you should be extra careful to avoid dodgy parts of the Internet. At some point, some hardware will probably fail and force you to get something new, and that may be the event that encourages upgrading everything to the latest and greatest. Reply David Morrison   2017-05-05 22:14 There is definitely a problem with upgrading iDevices if you connect them to a Mac and the Mac is not running a very recent version of OS X. Basically, older versions of iTunes will not talk to newer versions of IOS. What you get is a dialogue every time you plug in the device telling you this and advising you to upgrade iTunes - very annoying, since newer versions of iTunes will not run on older versions of OS X! So say you are running OS X 10.8 with iTunes 12. Your iDevices are running IOS 9.3.5. This works fine. You then decide to upgrade to IOS 10 on a device. If you try to do it through iTunes, it will say you need to upgrade iTunes - this warning is pretty vague, and does not raise any alarms. Unfortunately, iTunes 12 is the last version that will run on OS X 10.8. So your only option is to upgrade OS X which may not be acceptable. So you upgrade the device to IOS 10 over the Internet directly. Then plug it in to your Mac and get a warning from iTunes that it cannot talk to the device. Oops! No more backups of your device. No copying data files from apps to your Mac. No managing apps on your Mac. What does work is that iPhoto will still transfer photos, and probably Image Capture too. Third party file access apps on the Mac can also access the device. It seems to just be iTunes that does not work. Beware also that if you buy a new iDevice, it will not work with iTunes on your old Mac either. Sadly there is definitely no going back after the upgrade. You are stuck with IOS 10. Reply Derek Roff   2017-05-05 16:23 "The number next to Applications is the total number of apps installed, but when you tap Applications to see what’s inside, you see a list of 32-bit apps that have no updates available. " I'm not seeing exactly what you describe in the article, on my iPad 4 with iOS 10.3.1. When I tap on Applications, I see the number of apps (100), and "inside", I see the text you list about "These apps may slow down your iPad...". No app names appear directly below that. Then I see in grey text "Updates available". Below that are app names, including apps that I upgraded today. I haven't counted, but I think all 100 apps might appear in this group. This includes major apps like App Store, Remote, FaceTime, Google, YouTube, Amazon Prime Video, Dropbox, etc. It doesn't make sense to me that these are all 32-bit applications, but it's likely that some of the apps I have installed are. I haven't been able to guess the ordering system for this list. It isn't alphabetical. It isn't by age, install date, or most recent update. Tapping an arrow next to most apps will take me to the App Store, and show me that no update is available. A few say that the app is not available in the App Store. Below the last app on this list is grey text saying "No Updates Available". There are no apps listed under these words. Can you give us a few more words about this app list, and how to interpret the groupings and ordering? Thanks. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 16:41 My best guess is that it's confused. :-) What I'd try is going to the App Store app, making sure that everything is updated, and then restart the iPhone (hold down both buttons until it restarts). Reply Derek Roff   2017-05-05 17:15 Thanks for your response, Adam. A restart changed nothing for me, and the App Store shows no updates available. I guess I will wait and see what happens with the next iOS upgrade. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 17:17 The other thing you could try is signing out in Settings > iTunes & App Stores. Then sign back in and see if it has figured things out better. Reply Timothy Pearson  2017-05-05 16:22 Reading TidBITS in Apple News doesn't work for me. Following your prescription, I added it to my favorites; but it only shows one article since 3 October 2016, and several unrelated articles about "Tidbits" from other sites. If the iOS app stops working, I guess I will have to use the webpage instead. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 16:47 It sounds like your search hit "Tidbits" as a topic, rather than "TidBITS" as the publication. Try again, and make sure the one you're selecting has our capitalization. Tap it, and make sure it's our content, then tap the heart icon at the top right. Reply brent  2017-05-05 18:18 thanks guys! guess i wasn't the only one to ask, lol. i liked the app, really just to catch specific articles i see noted in FB or tweets. but the apple news will do. irony, i had never used apple news until now. keep up the good work, you are still my "go to" resource. Reply Roland G  2017-05-05 19:28 I'm an iOS developer since 2009. I have updated many apps to support 64bit and it really isn't a big deal. The developers of these apps just need to update their apps to support both 32/64 and all is well. At some point Apple needs to move on with their OS and I fully support that. If you don't want to update to 11, don't update, simple as that. Reply David Morrison   2017-05-05 22:24 I use the app occasionally, when in waiting rooms or travelling, but generally prefer the weekly roundup that arrives by e-mail. That said, I prefer the app's layout to News. News just shows the first few lines of each article to give you an idea of what it is about. This is often not helpful. In the app, there is a paragraph summarising the article, which often meant you did not even have to read the article if it was not of interest - a huge time saver. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-06 18:49 Hmm, I see what you mean — Apple News doesn't provide our blurb, just the first few lines of the article. I don't think there's any way to do that in News with an RSS feed. It might be possible with Apple News Format, but that's a whole 'nother ball of development wax. :-) Reply David Morrison   2017-05-05 22:31 I am having trouble adding the member version of the RSS feed. I logged in with Safari and clicked on RSS feed. It asked me if I wanted to open it in News. I said yes, then it told me the story could not be found. Tidbits does not appear in the favourites list. Going back to repeat this process, when I click on RSS, I get a message from Safari: Cannot open page Safari cannot open the page because the address is invalid. Any ideas? Reply David Morrison   2017-05-05 22:35 I quit News, and started again. Safari asked if I wanted to open the link in News. I said Yes. It showed the list of headlines, then said: Story unavailable. This story is not available in News. Given that I had not touched a story, this is mystifying….. Reply David Morrison   2017-05-05 22:37 Even though Tidbits is not listed in Favourites, the Tidbits news items are still being shown….. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-06 18:35 Can you just add it from the search in News? That's generally easier and will give the same result. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-06 18:50 What's weird is that it's working for me in Safari with no problems. Are you logged into the TidBITS site when you start adding? That might make a difference.

By Washington Post May 6, 2017 at 3:58 pm | Print View Apple says it intends to bolster the U.S. manufacturing sector by creating a $1 billion “advanced manufacturing fund” — with some of that initial money going toward a company the tech giant is prepared to partner with, CEO Tim Cook said. The announcement, which Cook made Wednesday on CNBC, comes after months of focus by President Donald Trump on jobs, manufacturing and the global economy. Cook did not appear to suggest that his company’s decision was influenced by Trump. But the president has showered praise on companies such as Carrier, Softbank and Charter Communications for promising to hire more American workers — even if some of those pledges predated Trump’s tenure. Unlike those firms, Apple’s announcement was not a hiring promise. The company simply said that it was hoping to promote U.S. manufacturing with its new fund. “We’ve talked to a company we’re going to invest in already,” Cook said. Apple intends to invest in programs that can train workers how to code, Cook added. But that much of the money for this effort will be borrowed rather than drawn from its substantial cash reserves. Cook has spoken previously about the shortage of U.S. workers who can perform advanced manufacturing. Advanced manufacturing differs from typical manufacturing in that it often requires specialized skills to produce highly engineered components that go into Apple’s products. “The U.S., over time, began to stop having as many vocational kind of skills,” Cook told “60 Minutes” in 2015. “I mean, you can take every tool-and-die maker in the United States and probably put them in a room that we’re currently sitting in. “In China, you would have to have multiple football fields.” Apple has taken some steps to highlight a commitment to U.S. jobs. In 2013, the company announced that it would begin manufacturing its high-end Mac Pro computer in Texas. But in recent years, the Mac Pro’s reputation has faltered amid complaints that the device is difficult to upgrade and poorly suited for next-generation computing. The share of Apple customers who use the Mac Pro are in the single digits, according to company execs in a recent interview with a number of Silicon Valley journalists — raising questions about the state of Apple’s U.S. manufacturing presence. An Apple spokesperson declined to comment for this story. Cook said Apple would release more details about its plans for the manufacturing fund later this month. Even as it pledges to spend big, Apple and other tech companies still have billions of dollars in revenues stashed overseas. Bringing that money home likely would incur a hefty tax bill — which is why Trump has proposed slashing corporate tax rates in a way that encourages businesses to repatriate those funds. Cook said that he’s hopeful the Trump administration can succeed with that push. Labor economists say restoring U.S. manufacturing jobs will be difficult at a time when automation is increasingly threatening to replace many workers. Businesses may move their factories back to the United States, but because American workers are still more expensive to employ than robots, those corporate decisions may not lead to an uptick in hiring. “The mentality is, ‘Can we increase our output first by becoming more efficient by using better technology as the first resort?’” Augustine Tantillo, president of the National Council of Textile Organization, told the Los Angeles Times. Analysts predict that even highly specialized industries such as law or radiology may be shaken up by artificial intelligence. And the trend isn’t just problematic for older workers. By 2030, more than a third of all U.S. jobs may be done by robots, according to a recent study by the consulting agency PricewaterhouseCoopers. Like what you're reading?

Saturday, at the annual meeting of his Berkshire Hathaway Inc. “And Apple, I regard them as being in a quite different business. I think Apple is much more of a consumer-products business” with skill at finding opportunities that are difficult for rivals to duplicate. Apple Inc. has become one of Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire’s largest holdings, valued at about $19.2 billion as of March 31. The billionaire said this week that he cut about a third of his stake in IBM, sending the shares down 2.5 percent Friday. Buffett and Vice Chairman Charles Munger built Berkshire into one of the world’s largest companies with bets on consumer-product companies like Coca-Cola Co. and older industries such as railroads. Munger said Saturday that avoiding Silicon Valley investments made sense for the pair, with some exceptions. “We avoided the tech stocks because we felt we had no advantage there, and other people did. And I think that’s a good idea not to play where the other people are better,” Munger said. “But, you know, if you ask me in retrospect, ‘What was our worst mistake in the tech field?’ I think we were smart enough to figure out Google.” Buffett’s Lament The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Sign Up The stock of  Alphabet Inc., the parent of Google, has advanced 20 percent this year, and its co-founders became two of the richest people in the world. Buffett said Berkshire’s Geico unit was an early customer of Google, paying the search-engine company when people clicked on the auto insurer’s ads. Given the price that Geico was paying per click, Buffett said, he should have seen the technology company’s promise. “I had plenty of ways to ask questions, or anything of the sort, and educate myself,” Buffett said. “But I blew it.” He also said he missed an opportunity by failing to invest in Amazon.com Inc. Buffett said time will tell about whether his recent wager on Apple is smarter than the 2011 IBM investment. He stressed that the companies have different types of customers, so each stock requires unique analysis. “They are two different types of decisions, and I was wrong on the first one,” Buffett said. “We’ll find out whether I’m right or wrong on the second.” Munger said it was a “very good sign” that Buffett jumped into Apple. “It shows either one of two things: Either you’ve gone crazy, or you’re learning,” Munger said. “I prefer the learning explanation.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

But What Can It Actually Do? Berkshire Hathaway 2017 Warren Buffett: Not Buying Google Is Berkshire Hathaway’s Biggest Mistake Jen Wieczner May 06, 2017 At the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting Saturday, CEO Warren Buffett made a startling admission. After surprising investors recently with his giant bet on Apple stock, the Oracle of Omaha—long averse to Silicon Valley companies—says he now wishes he'd bought more technology stocks when he had the chance. Apple (aapl) has been Buffett's greatest hit over the past year, boosting Berkshire's portfolio by about $2 billion in 2017 alone after the investor loaded up on more of the iPhone maker's stock. Now, Buffett is kicking himself for not taking advantage of the opportunity to buy stock in Google (googl) shortly after it went public more than a dozen years ago. The founders of the company now called Alphabet even came to see Buffett shortly after the tech company's IPO with an investment prospectus, but the legendary stock-picker passed. "I knew the guys," Buffett said at the Berkshire Hathaway (brk.a) meeting. "And so I had plenty of ways to ask questions or anything of the sort and educate myself, but I blew it." Buffett's business partner and Berkshire Hathaway vice chairman Charlie Munger regrets that decision even more. "If you asked me in retrospect what was our worst mistake in the tech field," that was it, Munger said at the meeting. "I think we were smart enough to figure out Google—those ads worked so much better in the early days than anything else—so I would say that we failed you there," Munger said. "We were smart enough to do it, and we didn’t do it." In fact, Berkshire's insurance subsidiary Geico was an early customer of Google, buying ads on the search engine for "$10 to $11 a click," so the investors had a front row seat seat to the business' growth, Buffett said. "Any time you're paying somebody $10 or $11 when somebody just punches a little thing where you’ve got no cost at all, that’s a good business," he added. "You’ve almost never seen a business like it." Warren BuffettWarren Buffett Says Berkshire Hathaway Stock May Start Paying Dividends Warren BuffettWarren Buffett Says Artificial Intelligence Will ‘Hurt’ Berkshire Hathaway’s Business Warren BuffettWarren Buffett’s Stocks Made $16 Billion Since the Last Berkshire Hathaway Meeting Warren BuffettHow to Watch Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Annual Meeting Live Stream debit cardsSquare Starts Rolling Out Its Own Debit Card Warren BuffettIBM Set to Drop $5 Billion in Value After Warren Buffett Sheds a Third of His Stake JobsU.S. Jobs Bounced Back in April After a Disappointing March Warren BuffettWarren Buffett’s Outlook for the Economy Hasn’t Changed Since 2009 Explaining his decision to invest in Apple after so many years of steering clear of the tech industry, Buffett said he sees the company as less of a technology company than a consumer products company (as opposed to IBM (ibm), whose stock the investor announced that he is selling this week). But Buffett also noted a fundamental change in the market that has made him see tech differently, observing that the five most valuable American companies are now worth a whopping more than $2.5 trillion combined. Those five companies, in order of market value, are Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft (msft), Amazon (amzn) and Facebook (fb). "And if you take those five companies, essentially you could run them with no equity capital at all," Buffett said. "You literally don’t need any money to run the five companies that are collectively worth more than $2.5 trillion." "That is a different world than what existed in the past," he added, comparing the "capital-light" nature of Internet and cloud computing companies to the capital-intensive industrial and steel businesses that he invested in earlier in his career. "But this is so much better if you happen to be good at it." Given his views on the compelling case for those companies, a shareholder asked Buffett during the annual meeting's Q&A why Berkshire had never invested in Amazon. "I was too dumb to realize what was going to happen," Buffett responded, saying he "never even considered" buying Amazon stock, despite his great respect for the e-commerce company's founder, Jeff Bezos. "I admired Jeff but I did not think he’d succeed on the scale that he has," Buffett said, noting that Amazon's lucrative foray into the cloud services business never occurred to him a few years ago. "I really underestimated the brilliance of the execution." But for Berkshire's executives, the one that got away, so to speak, is really Alphabet. "I don’t feel any regret about missing out on the achievements of Amazon," Munger said. "Other things were easy, and I think we screwed up a little." When Buffett declined to comment on those screw-ups, Munger clarified: "I meant Google." In the future, though, Berkshire is likely to make more bets on tech, Munger hinted. "I think it’s a very good sign that you bought the Apple stock," Munger told Buffett. "It shows either one of two things: Either you’ve gone crazy or you're learning. I prefer the learning explanation." Customer ServiceSite MapPrivacy PolicyAdvertisingAd ChoicesTerms of UseYour California Privacy RightsCareers © 2017 Time Inc. All rights reserved.

Here’s all the vital info you need By Rob Waugh Event for The Mail on Sunday Published: 17:06 EDT, 6 May 2017 | Updated: 17:06 EDT, 6 May 2017 e-mail View comments Like eBooks, streaming music services are difficult to really love. There’s no equivalent to that delicious crackle of cellophane as you unwrap a gatefold, special-edition vinyl double disc. But, also like eBooks, I use streaming services because I’m a dyed-in-the-wool skinflint.  With streaming – playing music over the internet instead of buying a hard copy – there is no danger of building up a really splendid music collection only to find the format is declared ‘dead’, and no one makes the players any more. Yes, I’ll admit I am still pretty bitter about my extensive MiniDisc collection. But streaming isn’t going to disappear any time soon.  You can listen to Taylor Swift on Apple Music and Amazon Music (although not Spotify, due to people being able to use it free) The Rolling Stones (left) and Rihanna (right) Katy Perry (left) and Neil Young (right)  Beyonce in concert for the 'Formation: World Tour' at Qualcomm Stadium, San Diego Ed Sheeran is a popular artist for millions of streaming app users  The music industry saw a five per cent rise in profits in 2016, after years of shattering losses – and the rise has been driven by people streaming music. There are now 100 million paying users worldwide.  If you’re using a smartphone to listen to music, streaming apps are by far the easiest way to get music on your phone – and allow you to load up as many albums as you want without having to painstakingly transfer files from a PC.  Most artists who initially refused to stream their music – such as Bob Dylan – have now caved in, and you can even listen to Taylor Swift on Apple Music and Amazon Music (although not Spotify, due to people being able to use it free).  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next 'Ingeniously plotted and immaculately performed': The... Neeme Järvi and his Estonian National Symphony Orchestra... Share this article Share New family plans mean you can have up to six users on one account – so you no longer need to suffer the indignity of being kicked off your music when your children want to listen to Katy Perry. But how do you choose a streaming service?  At first glance they all seem identical, with millions of tracks that can be played either via your PC, mobile phone or tablet.  Even the pricing is similar, with free services offering music with occasional adverts in between the tracks, and paid-for subscriptions offering the chance to stream higher-quality tracks, with no ads, and download them to your device for listening offline. But there are crucial differences, with some streaming CD-quality music – and some not.  They also differ in how easy it is to find new music. Some recommend music based on your tastes – and even where you are, with Google’s Play offering playlists for ‘work’ and ‘home’. So which is best for you?   APPLE MUSIC  Price £9.99 per month (£14.99 for family of six)  Maximum sound quality 256kbps  Songs 40 million  Free version No  Best feature Great if you have lots of iTunes tracks Downside Not so great for non Apple users.   Apple’s service has evolved into a sophisticated, high-gloss app that, typically of Apple, is slickly designed and intuitive to use.  If you’ve got a sizeable collection of music bought from iTunes over the years, it’s great, as you can access those files from anywhere, as well as the 40 million tracks offered by Apple Music – and Apple uses your music tastes to recommend other songs you might like.  The software on desktop PCs is a little ugly, but it works well on iPhone (and even Android). GOOGLE PLAY MUSIC  Price £9.99 (£14.99 for family of six)  Maximum sound quality 320kbps  Songs 40 million  Free version No  Best feature Upload your own tracks Downside Big Brotherstyle snooping.   Google’s service is a polished juggernaut, topped up with slightly spooky features, such as ‘knowing’ when you’re at home, and recommending music to unwind to (it does this using your phone’s sensors and Google’s alarming store of data).  The colourful app is easy to use – and you can upload 50,000 of your own tracks to listen to anywhere. Just like in Google Search, there’s an ‘I’m Feeling Lucky’ button, which brings up a radio station based on your music taste .  SPOTIFY Price £9.99 (£14.99 for family of six) Maximum sound quality 320kbps Songs 30 million Free version Yes, with adverts Best feature Lots of ways to find new music Downside Fewer tracks than its rivals.     Spotify has been going for nine years, making it the grandfather of streaming music. It feels extremely polished and excels at recommending you new music, with daily updated playlists based on your previous listening, divided by genres you like.  If you’re on a family plan, each member gets their own daily mix. Initially, it’s irritating having a computer ‘DJ’ your music – but the system works well and you swiftly fall into listening to them.  DEEZER  Price £9.99 (£14.99 for family of six) Maximum sound quality 1,411 kbps (with Deezer Elite for Sonos users) Songs 43 million Free version Yes, with adverts Best feature Works well with Sonos hi-fis Downside Clunkier than Spotify.   Deezer does it all – with a freebie version, and also hi-fi-friendly hi-res files, although the catch is that you’ll need to own a Sonos sound system to take advantage of the high-quality ‘Deezer Elite’ service, as well as paying £14.99 a month for the privilege. Another cute extra is live sports commentary – including Premiership games – delivered via TalkSport. TIDAL Price £9.99 (£19.99 for Tidal Hi-Fi) Maximum sound quality 1,411 kbps Songs 47 million Free version No Best feature CD-quality sound Downside The top-end version is very expensive.   Tidal was relaunched with ridiculous fanfare by Jay-Z and a small army of his celebrity friends – but it’s actually less awful than that makes it sound. The big sell here is high-quality sound – CD-quality, or even above, with some albums available at similar sound quality to the ‘master’ recordings used in studios.  There’s also a pleasing emphasis on playlists created by humans – with compilations curated by musicians.   AMAZON MUSIC  Price £9.99 (£14.99 for family of six) Maximum sound quality 256kbps Songs 40 million Free version No Best feature Great with Echo Downside Fewer good recommendations.   Amazon’s music service is a great option if you’ve already climbed on board with Amazon Prime – or you own an Echo smart speaker. It’s £9.99 a month, £7.99 for Prime users, and £3.99 for Echo users.  Sound quality is great, and it works with voice control. It’s less clever at recommending music than Spotify and Google Play Music, though.         Share or comment on this article e-mail Comments 0 Share what you think No comments have so far been submitted.

As  Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk typically does during the company's quarterly earnings calls, he shared key insighta about the business this week, including some comments on more speculative subjects. Commentary ranged from an update on what level of Model S and Model X sales Musk thinks Tesla can sustain, to his thoughts about the potential for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to buy Tesla.  Here's some of the most notable takeaways from Tesla's first-quarter earnings call (by way of an S&P Capital IQ transcript). Sustaining a 100,000-unit production rate for Model S and X In the past, Musk has indicated that he expected annual Model S and Model X deliveries to eventually hit a steady rate of about 100,000 units annually. While the company achieved this run-rate in its most recent quarter, some investors may be wondering whether the CEO still anticipates sustaining this level of production for the two pricey vehicles as its lower-cost, higher-volume Model 3 comes to market in July. Even as Model 3's launch approaches, it looks as if Musk still expects annual demand for the two vehicles to stay at this rate: We're going to produce 100,000 units approximately, so all that matters is there's demand. Is there going to be demand for 100,000 units? I believe there will be. And there is. Tesla CFO Deepak Ahuja added that there is "certainly sufficient demand" for Tesla's guidance for 47,000 to 50,000 total Model S and Model X deliveries during the first half of the year.  Apple hasn't shown interest in buying Tesla With Apple's cash hoard swelling to $257 billion in the company's most recent quarter, there's been some speculation that Tesla might be a good fit for a potential acquisition target for the tech giant. But Musk says Apple probably isn't interested anyway: I don't think they want to have a conversation [about buying Tesla]. I don't believe -- there's not been any indication that they do. Obviously, Apple company makes some great product. And yes, I mean, I use their phone and their laptop, it's cool. Musk added that he's unclear about what Apple wants to do "on the car front." Model Y is still a few years away Tesla has said that after its Model 3 production ramp-up, it plans to bring to market another SUV that's smaller than its Model X and closer in price to the $35,000 Model 3. But investors shouldn't expect the Model Y for another few years, Musk explained when he was asked about the company's goal to achieve annualized production of 1 million units annually by 2020: I think we need to come up with the Model Y sometime in 2020 or, aspirationally, late 2019. And then I think that 1 million units is quite likely -- combined, yes. Maybe more. Musk thinks energy-storage sales are about to jump When asked about why Tesla's total energy-storage megawatt hours deployed declined sequentially, Musk said the pullback in the near term is normal. But he still has high hopes for energy-storage deployment growth toward the end of the year: With respect to the battery stuff, it's a little lumpy right now, because you're at a big installation in [the] fourth quarter with Southern California Edison. And then we had a bit of a gap between the Powerwall 1 to Powerwall 2. So we should start to see that correcting in Q2 and Q3, and then particularly toward the end of this year, I would expect quite a dramatic ramp in storage deployment, like really dramatic. While Model Y may be still too far away for investors to give it much weight, and any speculation that Apple might buy Tesla might as well be ignored, investors should certainly keep an eye on demand for the Model S and X as the Model 3 comes to market. In addition, investors should watch Tesla's energy-storage sales to see if the company's nascent energy business can deliver on Musk's bullish expectations.  Daniel Sparks owns shares of Apple and Tesla. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple and Tesla. The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.

In announcing earnings on Tuesday, the company surprised many investors by disclosing that iPhone unit sales fell 1% from the same period a year earlier to 50.8 million. It was one of the few worrisome details in an otherwise strong quarter. While earnings factored heavily in this week’s discussions, it was by no means the only big Apple news. Construction of Apple Park, the company’s new Cupertino, Calif. headquarters, appears to be making good process based on a new video of the site taken from a drone. Another Apple nugget that got attention this week was that the company is working on a smart home hub-a competitor to Amazon’s Echo- that may be unveiled at Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference next month. This is Fortune’s weekly roundup of the biggest Apple news this week. To see last week’s roundup, click here. Read on for all this week’s Apple news from the past week. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter This week, Apple announced earnings for the three months ending April 1, revealing that it had $52.9 billion in revenue. IPhone unit sales fell, but the iPhone division’s revenue was up 1% year over year because of a higher average selling price. Mac sales rose 14%. Apple’s Services division, which includes its Apple Music, continues to soar, with revenue growth of 18%. Even the company’s Other Products division, which includes AirPods and the iPod, returned to growth, with revenue jumping 31%. Apple’s disappointing iPhone sales surprised some analysts who had anticipated increased unit sales. In a conference call with analysts, Apple CEO Tim Cook explained the decline by saying that recent rumors about the company’s new iPhones depressed sales. Cook said that anticipation for the expected devices, which could be announced later this year, prompted some iPhone owners to hold off buying new phones because they wanted to see if new models were coming. Apple’s iPad is the most popular tablet with a 24.6% market share, according to IDC. However, iPad shipments tumbled 13% in the first three months of this year, IDC said. Overall, manufacturers shipped 36.2 million tablets in the first quarter, an 8.5% decline. Consumers are increasingly turning to lightweight notebooks and two-in-one hybrid computers, putting pressure on tablets to keep pace. So far, they haven’t. Apple Park is coming along nicely. Documentarian Matthew Roberts published his latest video of Apple’s headquarters. It showed that the main building, which will have 2.8 million square feet of floorspace, is nearly completed, and that construction crews are installing trees and landscaping. Apple employees are expected to start moving in soon. The moving process for all 12,000 employees is likely to take at least six months. For months, Apple has been rumored to be working on a smart home hub that would let users play music and control devices throughout their smart homes. Now, Ming-Chi Kuo, an Apple analyst at KGI Securities, says the company may unveil the device in June at its Worldwide Developers Conference. The device could come with built-in speakers and run on Apple’s virtual personal assistant Siri. It also may also be more expensive than the $180 Echo, according to rumors. Apple, however, hasn’t confirmed it’s working on such a device. AirPods are a hit. Apple’s wireless earbuds are already hard to find on store shelves, and according to a study this week from researchers Creative Strategies and Experian, 98% of owners surveyed say they’re either “very satisfied” or “satisfied” with them. That’s a higher satisfaction than the iPhone received in 2007 at the same time in its lifecycle. One more thing...If you have hundreds of thousands of dollars burning a hole in your pocket and you want to meet Tim Cook, now’s your chance. He’s auctioning a lunch with him to benefit the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights charity. The lunch is valued at $100,000, but bids already top $345,000. The auction ends May 16.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement $20 Android phones may be the cheapest iPod touch alternatives available 05/06/2017 at 8:00 AM by Brad Linder 9 Comments Smartphones have largely replaced portable media players for most people. It’s been a few years since Apple bothered to update its iPod touch, and it’s been even longer since I’ve seen any other company try to offer a good Android-powered alternative to Apple’s touchscreen media player. Sometimes it can be useful to have a device that doesn’t make phone calls, send text messages, or do anything else that requires paying a monthly fee. Sure, you could pay $199 or more for an iPod touch. But you could also just buy a cheap Android phone… and then not activate it. That option could save you as much as $180, because Walmart and Best Buy are each selling surprisingly decent Android phones for as little as $20. Left: Alcatel Pixi 4 / Right: ZTE Midnight Pro 4G LTE Walmart Family Mobile Alcatel Pixi 4 Walmart sells this for just $19.88. It features a 4.5 inch, 854 x 480 pixel display, 1GB of RAM, 8GB of storage, a microSD card slot, front and rear cameras, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 210 processor, a 1890 mAh (6.76 Wh) battery, and Android 6.0 software. It’s not going to win any speed awards, but it’s more than capable of functioning as a small, cheap media player, web browser, or handheld device for casual games. I actually picked one up recently, and it suffers from limited screen viewing angles and the audio quality from the headphone jack isn’t superb, but it’s certainly acceptable for a $20 device. Best of all, if you disable WiFi and enable Android’s battery saver mode, you can get stellar battery life. After playing music for more than 5 hours with the screen on, the Pixi 4 was reporting that it still had 63 percent of its battery capacity left to burn through. Oh, and the battery is user replaceable, something that’s not true of many phones that are significantly more expensive. So what’s the catch? This phone is locked to Walmart’s Family Mobile service. So if you do plan to use this $20 Pixi 4 smartphone as, well, a phone… then your only choice is to use it with Walmart’s pre-paid wireless network (with plans starting at $25 per month). The $20 price is also technically a discount. The phone has a list price of $40, and other stores are selling similar Alcatel smartphones for even more. So you may not always be able to pick up a Pixi 4 for this price. At $20, it’s a steal. But I’m not sure I’d recommend this phone for $60 or more when there are significantly better phones available in that price range. ZTE Midnight Pro 4G LTE  Best Buy sells this 5 inch smartphone for just $19.99. Like the Walmart Pixi 4, the ZTE Midnight Pro 4G LTE is locked to a budget wireless carrier. In this case, the phone is designed for use with Simple Mobile, a pre-paid carrier with plans that start at $26 per month. But like the Pixi 4, this is a phone you should be able to use without activating the cellular service. The ZTE Midnight Pro 4G LTE has a Snapdragon 210 processor, 1GB of RAM, 8GB of storage, an 854 x 480 pixel display, a microSDHC card reader, and a 2,300 mAh battery. It’s a little larger than the Alcatel phone, but has a bigger battery. On the down side, the ZTE phone ships with Android 5.1, which is an older version of Google’s mobile operating system. I wouldn’t really expect either phone to get any major software updates. Both phones include the Play Store These phones both support Google Mobile Services, and come with the Google Play Store pre-installed. That means you have access to millions of Android apps out-of-the box. If you’d prefer not to login with a Google account or use the Play Store, you could also set up the phones with a third-party app store like F-Droid. That way if you lose the phone while out on a run, you don’t have to worry about someone gaining access to your personal data. Or you could give the phone to a kid without worrying that they’ll start purchasing paid apps without your permission. A few other notes I haven’t personally used the ZTE Midnight Pro 4G LTE yet, so I can’t say how it compares with the Pixi 4 in terms of audio quality, screen viewing angles, or battery life. But there is one thing the Midnight Pro has going for it: Best Buy’s website allows you to buy as many as 5 phones, while Walmart will only let you purchase 2 Pixi 4 phones. The reason I know that is because, as I mentioned recently, I’ve been in the market for some cheap MP3 players to use as part of an upcoming multimedia exhibit in Philadelphia. While I really like the super-cheap Simplicity Fashion Pocket MP3 Player, it doesn’t have a display. And ultimately we decided a portable music player with a screen would be preferable. After looking for a good portable media player in the $20-or-less price range, I ultimately realized that a cheap phone would be the best option since it would have a larger, easier-to-read display and the ability to run a variety of apps. It’s also more likely that I’ll be able to find a use for these phones after the exhibit closes. Look, I’m not saying these are good phones, or even particularly good portable media players. But they meet my needs at the moment, and they’re way more versatile than any $20 device really has a right to be… probably because they’ve got more than $20 worth of hardware under the hood. A big part of the reason they’re sold this cheap is because Walmart, Best Buy, and Simple Mobile expect you to sign up for cellular service. But you don’t have to. I’ll update this post with some notes about the ZTE phone after I’ve had a chance to test one.   Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Email Leave a Reply 9 Comments on "$20 Android phones may be the cheapest iPod touch alternatives available" Login with Notify of new follow-up comments new replies to my comments Notify of new replies to this comment Notify of new replies to this comment Sort by:   newest | oldest | most voted Guest 12John34 Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open «Comment Reporting» form.

A couple of Christmas’s ago, I purchased three Samsung Ace Style Net10 handsets for $4.99 each at Kroger. My kids like using theirs for music and games, but I use mine in the office as a Google Music streamer connected to a nice Bluetooth speaker. Even better, if you get a free Google Voice number and install Google Hangouts, you have unlimited voice, text & data anywhere you can connect to WiFi, which in urban areas is almost everywhere.

I like the reasonable form-factor and pixel density, Android 6 and dual SIM. I hope to get a better device on those points: better touch and screen technology (but no crazy high PPI please, waste of resources), slightly better camera, a GPS chip. Also 8GB of flash would be nice. I connect online on a small plan from time to time, so I had to remove some default uninstallable services like Facebook or “user care center”, though. No “standard” rooting method was available at that time, but MTK dev tool leaked in some way (this would be awesome if officially released…). There is a pre-boot that let us access the whole flash “offline”, so I dumped and customized the OS without needing root. Very happy with this device, overall.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Why Apple Shouldn’t Worry About This Sales Miss Apple has missed its sales target by a wide margin in India but this shouldn't send the alarm bells ringing. Harsh Chauhan (TechJunk13) May 6, 2017 at 3:08PM Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) dream of making a dent in India's booming smartphone market has run into trouble, for now. The country's finance ministry rejected the iPhone-maker's tax exemption demands in mid-April due to an imminent change in the tax structure, this pushed back Apple's plans of setting up a fully fledged manufacturing site in the county. This isn't good news for Apple as it is reportedly struggling to sell iPhones in India. Bank of America-Merrill Lynch estimates that Apple sold just 2 million iPhones in the country during the previous fiscal year that ended in March, way below its ambitious target of 10 million units. Apple struggled to sell more iPhones in India because of a steep average selling price of $612. Indian customers are price sensitive and sales of smartphones priced above $300 make up for just 7% of the market. Therefore, Apple needs to bring down the price of its iPhones to attract more customers, which is possible only if it starts manufacturing in country to avoid import duties. Image Source: Apple  What Apple plans to do in India Apple is moving ahead with its manufacturing facility in India despite red tape. Officials in the state of Karnataka cited by The Economic Times believe that the Cupertino-based company is going to start making iPhones in the state "regardless of the outcome of its requests for certain concessions from the central government." More specifically, Apple will begin the trial assembly of iPhones in India from May with Taiwanese contract manufacturer Wistron. It eventually plans to roll out comprehensive iPhone manufacturing lines in India in 2018 once the trial assembly phase is complete, but this will need government co-operation. Apple needs a waiver on the countervailing duty that will allow it to import high-precision components to make iPhones without additional costs. The good news is that India's IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad will soon meet top Cupertino officials to discuss iPhone manufacturing in the country. The minister is believed to be keen to help Apple set up a full-fledged manufacturing base to promote Indian-made products. In fact, 42 companies are currently making handsets in India, while another 30 are manufacturing components, so it is likely that the ministry will give Apple whatever leeway it can under the incoming tax regime. Moreover, the state of Karnataka is also pursuing the iPhone maker's case with the central government, arguing that India is still not mature enough to make the high-end components that Apple needs, making importing the company's only option. Apple's ambition of setting up a comprehensive manufacturing base in this market might receive a shot in the arm if discussions with the IT ministry go in its favor. In fact, Apple has already been exempted from sourcing iPhone components locally in India, though it still needs to pay a duty on imports. This ruling allowed it to set up its own retail stores in the country, which will go a long way to boost sales. Apple isn't ignoring the long-term picture Apple is trying to take advantage of whatever leeway it has received in the Indian market so far by deciding to increase its retail presence. As discussed in a previous article, the company is setting up more than 100 franchised stores. It eventually plans a six-fold expansion of these stores next year to take on the Chinese smartphone companies that have rapidly expanded their retail outlets. Apple needs a stronger retail presence to improve brand awareness for the company and its products. The iPhone maker's brand awareness in this market currently lags the likes of Sony, BlackBerry, and other local smartphone makers. In fact, the company ranked just 10th out of 12 smartphone companies in India last year. Apple is doing the right thing by expanding its retail stores in India from a long-term perspective. Indians might not be buying a lot of high-end smartphones at present, but this could change with a rise in disposable income. Trading Economics forecasts that India's total disposable personal income could rise 45% in 2020 from 2016, boosting consumer spending in the process.

Citigroup thinks so Zac Hall - May. 5th 2017 8:51 am PT @apollozac AAPL Company Netflix Tesla View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Analysts often dream about spending Apple’s growing cash pile by listing which company’s Apple could acquire, and this week Apple’s cash reserves climbed past a quarter trillion dollars at $256.8 billion. In response, Citigroup analyst Jim Suva has listed both Netflix and Tesla as takeover targets for Apple… Sony A6500 Reuters reports that Suva included seven companies as potential M&A targets for Apple: Netflix, Disney, Tesla, Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts, Take Two Interactive Software, and Hulu. The idea in part, as Citi has highlighted before, is that Apple may be more likely to do something with its cash pile which is mostly overseas if the Trump administration offers corporations a tax holiday as expected. Apple CEO Tim Cook has talked about the need for corporate tax reform (and a lower tax rate) as recently as this week, although he has been cool on large company acquisitions: In terms of large acquisitions… we have looked at large companies. In each case, it didn’t pass our test for various reasons. We will look again, I’m sure we will. I think we have the management talent and depth to do it. We don’t feel pressure to acquire revenue…we want to make great products. Cash is not burning a hole in our pocket. One exception is Beats Electronics which Apple acquired for $3 billion as the foundation for Apple Music and the expansion of its audio business. However unlikely a major acquisition by Apple of any of the companies listed by Citi may be, the firm certainly isn’t alone in predicting Apple could use its cash for a big company takeover. Last month RBC similarly floated the idea of Apple buying Disney to create ‘unique opportunities’ although the firm only described the likelihood as ‘greater than 0%.’ Reuters doesn’t give Citi’s analyst much credit either: The analyst is rated three out of five stars for his recommendations on Apple, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine.

Berkshire Hathaway bought IBM’s stock back in 2011. More recently, Buffett has invested heavily in Apple. Buffett recently revealed to CNBC that he had sold about one-third of his position in IBM, noting that he “revalued” the company downward. He had held just over 81.2 million shares in the company. Meanwhile, Buffett has continued to beef up his stake in Apple. As of February, he publicly said that they owned 133 million shares. Berkshire began building its stake in the iPhone maker in the first quarter of 2016. “I regard them as being quite different businesses,” Buffett said during Berkshire Hathaway’s annual shareholders meeting. “They are two different types of decisions and I was wrong on the first one. And we’ll find out whether I was right or wrong on the second. I do not regard them as apples and apples. I don’t regard them as apples and oranges.” Reflecting on missed tech opportunities Berkshire’s vice chairman Charlie Munger added that they avoided tech stocks in the past because they felt they had “no advantage where other people did.” “I think that’s a good idea to not play where the other people are better,” Munger said. He added that he thought they were “probably smart enough” to figure out Google (GOOG), though. “I would say that we failed you there,” Munger said. “We were smart enough to do it.” Buffett explained that Geico was Google’s customer very early on. He added that they were paying $10 or $11 per click. “That’s a good business,” Buffett said. Berkshire Hathaway vice chairman Charlie Munger visits the shareholder shopping day in a golf cart as part of the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting weekend in Omaha, Nebraska, May 5, 2017. REUTERS/Rick WilkingMore Of course, it’s been a learning process, just like they learned with Wal-Mart. “We blew Wal-Mart too,” Munger said. “It was a total cinch. We were smart enough to figure that.” Berkshire didn’t invest in Wal-Mart until the second quarter of 2005. In the fourth quarter of 2016, Berkshire sold about 89% of its stake. “Execution is what counts,” Buffett said. Buffett acknowledged that they could be making a mistake with IBM. “It’s harder to predict, in my view, the winners in various items or how much price competition will enter to something like cloud services and all of that.” He went on to sing Amazon founder Jeff Bezos praises as someone who’s been a big competitor in the space. “He has been the CEO of two businesses, starting from scratch,” Buffett said. “Andy Grove at Intel used to say, ‘think about if you had a silver bullet and you can shoot one competitor. A lot of people would probably aim that silver bullet at Jeff.” Follow our Yahoo Finance’s coverage of Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting at Finance.Yahoo.com/BRKLiveStream.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Warren Buffett, who long shunned investments in technology stocks and then made an ill-fated bet on IBM, said that mistake shouldn’t discourage wagers on the broader industry. “I thought it would do better in the six years that have elapsed than it has,” Buffett said of International Business Machines Corp. Saturday, at the annual meeting of his Berkshire Hathaway Inc. “And Apple, I regard them as being in a quite different business. I think Apple is much more of a consumer-products business” with skill at finding opportunities that are difficult for rivals to duplicate. Apple Inc. has become one of Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire’s largest holdings, valued at about $19.2 billion as of March 31. The billionaire said this week that he cut about a third of his stake in IBM, sending the shares down 2.5 percent Friday. Buffett and Vice Chairman Charles Munger built Berkshire into one of the world’s largest companies with bets on consumer-product companies like Coca-Cola Co. and older industries such as railroads. Munger said Saturday that avoiding Silicon Valley investments made sense for the pair, with some exceptions. “We avoided the tech stocks because we felt we had no advantage there, and other people did. And I think that’s a good idea not to play where the other people are better,” Munger said. “But, you know, if you ask me in retrospect, ‘What was our worst mistake in the tech field?’ I think we were smart enough to figure out Google.” Buffett’s Lament The stock of Alphabet Inc., the parent of Google, has advanced 20 percent this year, and its co-founders became two of the richest people in the world. Buffett said Berkshire’s Geico unit was an early customer of Google, paying the search-engine company when people clicked on the auto insurer’s ads. Given the price that Geico was paying per click, Buffett said, he should have seen the technology company’s promise. “I had plenty of ways to ask questions, or anything of the sort, and educate myself,” Buffett said. “But I blew it.” He also said he missed an opportunity by failing to invest in Amazon.com Inc. Buffett said time will tell about whether his recent wager on Apple is smarter than the 2011 IBM investment. He stressed that the companies have different types of customers, so each stock requires unique analysis. “They are two different types of decisions, and I was wrong on the first one,” Buffett said. “We’ll find out whether I’m right or wrong on the second.” © Copyright 2017 Bloomberg News.

Noah BuhayarKatherine Chiglinsky Warren Buffett said time will tell about whether his recent wager on Apple is smarter than the 2011 IBM investment. Photo: Reuters Seattle/New York: Warren Buffett, who long shunned investments in technology stocks and then made an ill-fated bet on IBM, said that mistake shouldn’t discourage wagers on the broader industry. “I thought it would do better in the six years that have elapsed than it has,” Buffett said of International Business Machines Corp. Saturday, at the annual meeting of his Berkshire Hathaway Inc. “And Apple, I regard them as being in a quite different business. I think Apple is much more of a consumer-products business” with skill at finding opportunities that are difficult for rivals to duplicate. Apple Inc. has become one of Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire’s largest holdings, valued at about $19.2 billion as of 31 March. The billionaire said this week that he cut about a third of his stake in IBM, sending the shares down 2.5% Friday. Buffett and vice chairman Charles Munger built Berkshire into one of the world’s largest companies with bets on consumer-product companies like Coca-Cola Co. and older industries such as railroads. Munger said Saturday that avoiding Silicon Valley investments made sense for the pair, with some exceptions. “We avoided the tech stocks because we felt we had no advantage there, and other people did. And I think that’s a good idea not to play where the other people are better,” Munger said. “But, you know, if you ask me in retrospect, ‘What was our worst mistake in the tech field?’ I think we were smart enough to figure out Google.” Buffett’s lament The stock of Alphabet Inc., the parent of Google, has advanced 20% this year, and its co-founders became two of the richest people in the world. Buffett said Berkshire’s Geico unit was an early customer of Google, paying the search-engine company when people clicked on the auto insurer’s ads. Given the price that Geico was paying per click, Buffett said, he should have seen the technology company’s promise. “I had plenty of ways to ask questions, or anything of the sort, and educate myself,” Buffett said. “But I blew it.” He also said he missed an opportunity by failing to invest in Amazon.com Inc. Buffett said time will tell about whether his recent wager on Apple is smarter than the 2011 IBM investment. He stressed that the companies have different types of customers, so each stock requires unique analysis. “They are two different types of decisions, and I was wrong on the first one,” Buffett said. “We’ll find out whether I’m right or wrong on the second.” Bloomberg Noah BuhayarKatherine Chiglinsky Topics: Warren Buffett IBM Google Apple tech stocks More From Livemint READ MORE Delhi: NDMC rejects 25 applications for eatery license in Connaught Place BSE to keep seven companies under enhanced surveillance CMs of Naxal-hit states to meet Monday to devise new strategy to tackle armed rebels First Published: Sat, May 06 2017. 11 04 PM IST Editor's Picks The politics and positioning of Priyanka Chopra Why you can never leave the WhatsApp family group Onus on RBI as govt notifies new rules to tackle NPAs of banks Latest News Delhi: NDMC rejects 25 applications for eatery license in Connaught Place BSE to keep seven companies under enhanced surveillance CMs of Naxal-hit states to meet Monday to devise new strategy to tackle armed rebels Meghalaya villagers lodge FIR against BSF for ‘fake encounter’ French election: 10 defining moments in France’s roller coaster polls Mint On Sunday 1965 Nanda Devi spy mission, the movie Meeting Lucy in Ethiopia, and other travel stories from the cradle of humanity The Universe of the Mantra Secrets of the world’s biggest gin collection The Tao of thinking Home Companies Opinion Industry Politics Consumer Lounge Multimedia Money Sitemap Subscribe Contact Us Mint Code Privacy policy Terms of Use Advertising Mint Apps About Us Syndication Mint on Sunday RSS Hindustan Times Desimartini Copyright © 2017 HT Media Ltd.

Recent data from Counterpoint Research has reinforced that: As this chart from Statista shows, Chinese firms Huawei and BBK Electronics (through its Oppo and Vivo brands) shipped the most phones this past quarter, a good ways ahead of Apple and Samsung. That said, it’s important to remember that market share isn’t the same as profits. While Huawei, Oppo, and Vivo are way up in China, much of their growth is coming from lower-cost, lower-margin devices. There is a lot of room to sell such devices in China — and the three are making it a point to sell higher-end models — but, as Xiaomi can attest, it's a fickle market. And though Apple’s declining growth in the region is significant, Counterpoint says iPhones still rule the premium market, with a whopping 80% share among phones that cost more than 4000 RMB (about $580). Apple lives solely in the high-end — apart from the iPhone SE, which is generally weaker than Huawei and BBK’s phones at the same price — so its slowdown seems to be because that market is saturated. (For now.) Samsung appears to have been hit harder in the region. While its premium Galaxy S series does alright for itself, its smartphone business is still about quantity more than quality. Its mid-range devices are being chewed up by the local competition, which led to its big shrink in sales.

Apps iPhone Apps iPad Apps Mac Apps Apple TV Apps Apple Watch Apps The Best Apps Tutorials Jailbreak Jailbreak Tweaks Jailbreak Guide Unlock Guide Deals Latest Deals Devices iPhone iPad Mac Apple Watch Apple TV More Download Wallpapers iPhone Photography Expert Tips Podcasts How to use Extender Installer to automatically re-sign your jailbreak app Joaquim Barbosa on May 6, 2017 18 Now that Extender Installer has been released for Cydia Extender on jailbroken devices, we’ve had a few requests for a quick guide on how to use it. Look no further! Follow our how-to below to ensure your jailbreak app never needs sideloading from a computer again. At last, your semi-untethered jailbreak is truly semi-untethered. How to use Extender Installer 1) Ensure you have sideloaded your jailbreak app from your computer, and that your device is in a jailbroken state. If you use an Apple ID with Two-step Authentication turned on, you must log into your Apple ID account and create an application-specific password to use in this step. 2) Remove any previous instances of Extender, and any previous instances of modifications of Extender, as they could cause problems. This includes, but is not necessarily limited to, installd OTA Patch, CyExtender Plus, and Ext3nder. Immortal and Karen Tsai’s AppSync are fine to keep, and will cause no issues. I also ran iCleaner afterwards to make sure all leftover files were removed. 3) Launch Cydia, and add the following source: http://repo.incendo.ws Please note, the package will probably be available from a standard repo once it’s out of beta. 4) Locate and install the package entitled Extender Installer on the above repo. Please note, this name is likely to change in future. 5) Launch the Cydia Extender application which has been installed to your home screen. Navigate to the More tab, and sign in with your Apple ID. Please note, if you are paranoid about entering your Apple ID into non-Apple services, you can set up a throwaway Apple account and use that for this purpose. If you do this, you must also have used that same Apple ID to sideload the jailbreak app from your computer in Step 1. If you use an Apple ID with Two-step Authentication turned on, you must use an application-specific password in this step. 6) You can leave all the other options as standard in the More tab. 7) You should get a couple of notifications stating that you are signed in. Relaunch Extender to verify that your Apple ID is showing. Check that your jailbreak app is listed under the Installed tab. 8) You can test the re-signing process by going to the Installed tab, and pressing the Re-sign button. It will attempt to re-sign and re-install the app for you, and this will let you see if it works. 9) You should get a notification if the re-installation is successful. If you encounter errors, navigate to the More tab, and select Troubleshooting. It offers solutions to common errors, most of which can be solved by using the Revoke Certificates button. It took me a few tries to get it going smoothly, revoking certificates and so forth, but it eventually got up and running fine. Remember, this tool is in beta, and so may have a few bugs at this point. It will also gain more features and undergo a name change before it’s complete. The tool currently does not run in Low Power mode, so bear that mind if you leave that on at all times on your device. Let me know if you have any problems which aren’t covered in the Troubleshooting section of the app, as well as if it works successfully for you!

Joaquim Barbosa It should do, though alert the dev if not. He has added support for most common versions of Yalu. By the way, I would stick with the original version of Yalu personally, though it’s of course up to you. Thanks for reading! aizathisyam thanks for the answer. i tested the extender and i can verify it works with blueyalu. as for the reason why i prefer blueyalu than the original, because the blueyalu has the HDMI adaptor fix from the beta 8 which Luca had released on his github but did not release in ipa version. Zencowboy007 I didn’t see beta 8 on his github? Extender worked after revoking certificate then making new 2-step auth codes on apple. Thanks Joaquim Barbosa Did you use the same 2-step code to sideload Yalu from the computer as you did in Extender Installer, or did you use two different ones? Wanted to know to make sure my guide is accurate. Cheers! Zencowboy007 Used same then had to revoke on apple id site and enter a new one. So at moment 2 different 2-step codes. One for yalu and one for extender. Joaquim Barbosa Cheers, I wonder whether they always have to be different, or whether they could be the same in theory but just ended up different in your case… TheBoi23 So how can I use this to move from 9.3.3 to 10.2, by saving my blobs ? CryptoCoin420 You don’t. That’s not what this tool does. Joaquim Barbosa Use Prometheus for that, I have a guide on this site. But you can’t if you didn’t save blobs for 10.2 when it was still signed, which it isn’t now. Did you save 10.2 blobs when it was signed? Sid Just to confirm – if my phone were to restart, I would lose JB and have to re-sideload Yalu, correct? In other words, this tweak would not prevent me having to sideload if my phone restarted. Am I right here? Marc You won’t have to re-sideload Yalu (it should still be on your home screen) but you will have to re run it to rejailbreak. Joaquim Barbosa Not exactly. You must run the jailbreak app after every reboot always, to rejailbreak. That’s because Yalu is semitethered. This tool doesn’t change that. But in addition to that, you would normally have to side load Yalu every week from a computer. This tool DOES fix that. With this, you should be able to keep the Yalu app on your phone forever without side loading it again, though you’ll still have to run Yalu once per boot. Tom Hopkins When I tried this, I got an error message saying that my Apple ID was incorrect (it wasn’t). Anyone know how to fix this? I’m using a free Apple ID. Joaquim Barbosa Got a symbol in your password or Apple ID? Try updating to the most recent version of Extender Installer and trying again… tunutsaigon Gave it a try and all is going well. Thank you, @joaquimbarbosadiscuss:disqus… 😉 Steve Harold Good thing this came out! I installed kine from a browser a month or two ago and Apple just now revoked it! This new one hopefully works.

An ever-present figure at nearly all major Apple events since Steve Jobs made his return to the company, Schiller is perhaps best known to the more casual Apple observers for his “Can’t innovate any more, my ass!" remark while introducing the 2013 Mac Pro. The Senior Vice President Worldwide Marketing at Apple was in Bengaluru recently to inaugurate the company’s app accelerator facility in Bengaluru where he a spoke to group of Indian app makers that included CEOs of popular apps like Zomato and Practo, as well as developer of the indie app Avaz. “This [the app accelerator] is a unique new thing we haven't done anywhere else in the world," Schiller told the app makers. “We have created the idea of this app accelerator where developers like yourselves can come here in large number week-in and week-out and get help with whether it's design expertise and I think that's something Apple has a lot of knowledge on to share, as small as to be able to experiment and play with the technologies that we are working on." Later during the trip, Gadgets 360 got a chance to sit down with Schiller and pick his brains on a wide variety of topics, both developer- and consumer-focussed. Before you ask, yes, we did quiz Schiller on the state of neglect that the Mac Pro finds itself in, but just three days after our conversation, news broke that Apple is completely revamping the Mac Pro, so it made no sense to share that bit of our conversation. Here are excerpts of our conversation with Phil Schiller. Gadgets 360: With all the recent changes in the App Store, can developers expect to see upgrade pricing next? Phill Schiller: The reason we haven’t done it is that it's much more complex than people know, and that's okay, it's our job to think about complex problems, but the App Store has reached so many successful milestones without it because the business model makes sense to customers. And the upgrade model, which I know very well from my days of running many large software programmes, is a model from the shrink-wrapped software days that for some developers is still very important, for most, it’s not really a part of the future we are going. I think for many developers, subscription model is a better way to, go than try to come up with a list of features, and different pricing for upgrade, versus for new customers. I am not saying it doesn't have value for some developers but for most it doesn’t, so that's the challenge. And if you look at the App Store it would take a lot of engineering to do that and so would be at the expense of other features we can deliver. For example, the App Store has one price for an app, when you see it, you see if there's a price on it, that's the price. It doesn't have multiple prices for multiple tiers of customers so to engineer that in, it's not impossible, but a lot of work for a small segment of software that we hope for many of them, subscription pricing is a better model, the one where the customers are comfortable with. So we’ll keep talking to developers about what's most important on their list, we want them to keep telling is if that [upgrade pricing] is high on the list or not, and we’ll keep an open mind to it, but it's harder than people realise. Gadgets 360: Personally, what are your thoughts on devices like Google Home and Amazon’s Echo? Phill Schiller: Well, I won't talk to either one specifically, [I] don't want to. My mother used to have a saying that if you don't have something nice to say, say nothing at all. So, instead, let’s abstract the conversation just briefly to some of the general concepts and talk about those, because it's really interesting. First of all, there is a lot of talk in the industry about voice-driven assistants and we believe deeply in voice-driven assistants that's why invest in Siri, but there is interest in a voice-only assistant, where there is no screen, and we think it's important to that there are times when it's convenient to simply use your voice when you are not able to use the screen. For example, if you're driving [and] you want Siri to work for you without having to look at the screen, that's the best thing. Or maybe you're across the room, and you want to ask Siri to change the song you were listening to - you don’t have to walk over and back [and you can use Siri instead]. So there's many moments where a voice assistant is really beneficial, but that doesn't mean you'd never want a screen. So the idea of not having a screen, I don't think suits many situations. For example if I'm looking for directions and I'm using Maps, Siri can tell me those directions by voice and that's really convenient but it's even better if I can see that map, and I can see what turns are coming up, and I can see where there is congestion, I understand better my route, and what I'm going to do. Or, for example, with photography, and one of the most popular reasons for our products is photography now, and photography requires a screen. So the idea of a device without a screen, well it’s not really useful for that whole category of photos that we all share. and all the social networking apps that are now embracing photos more and more, well, it doesn't work really so great in voice-only assistants. Or the biggest category of all of apps is games, and I have yet to see any voice-only games that, for me, are nearly as fun as the one that I play on my screen. And so I think voice assistants are incredibly powerful, their intelligence is going to grow, they’re gonna do more for us, but the role of the screen is gonna remain very important to all of this. Gadgets 360: But I don't think anyone is suggesting that they are going to replace our phones, right, so is that a fair comparison? Phill Schiller: With billions of people, there’s somebody always suggesting something everywhere [laughs], but there is an interesting question about role of voice-only products in comparison to the products that have voice, and screen, and touch, and I think that's an interesting discussion about when is each appropriate, and what can they do in our lives. I think that's interesting. Apple Siri Speaker Tipped to Launch at WWDC, Will Take on Amazon Echo Gadgets 360: How has the response to Swift been so far? Phill Schiller: First of all, Swift is going incredibly well, better than what we imagined when we first started working on it. It has got incredible adoption, it has got incredible adaptability, from school children to the biggest developers in the world [..] I don’t think we’ve seen this before - a brand new language designed around mobile products to help us make better code for all the uses we see with apps, this is a unique new thing and, I have seen in some stats, [it’s] the fastest growing language in the world. So we are really excited about that. We are continuing to evolve [Swift], as you say, we were very upfront about it from the beginning that we knew we would learn a lot in the first versions of Swift, and we have been [learning]. So developers are aware of that and we’ve been very transparent about that, and there will be a lot more about that at our upcoming developer conference, so for the remaining part of your question about what’s coming with Swift, there’s a lot to come, stay tuned for news on that. The other thing that I just bring up with Swift is there's been a lot of excitement around the new Swift Playgrounds that we've put there out for iPad that allows children in school to learn to code in a fun and entertaining way but it's real coding. I think this is phenomenal. The idea that school children at elementary school ages can begin to learn about programming I think that is incredibly important. When we grew up, I grew up - and I’m much older than many of you - it was mandatory to learn a foreign language in school because it's useful in general and it exercises part of your brain that wouldn't otherwise be exercised, and makes you more likely to learn other languages in the future because you’ve really learned that process. I think today it's even more important that school children learn a programming language, as much we used to have to learn a foreign language. Because not that everyone will grow up to become a programmer, but that everyone can understand the concepts of programming, because software is gonna be a part of everyone's life no matter what your job, whether you're a software developer or you work with software developers understanding that is going to help every child get a job at some point in their life. In addition, if you start at a younger age like in elementary school, there are lot of students that by the time they get to high school with peer pressure they might decide that they don't want to become a programmer. Before they know whether that's actually something they are very passionate about. So if you can teach children [a] little bit about programming and get them excited about the concept of creating software, before social pressures discourage some [kids], then people would discover love for something early enough that they can explore that on their own. And I think through a process like that, we’ll get a larger diversity of people who are going into programming whether male or female, [irrespective of] their ethnic background, their economic background, they can discover this passion on their own, while they are still very young. I think that's a really important thing in society to enable. Disclosure: Apple sponsored the correspondent's flights and hotel for the trip to Bengaluru.

Apple, Google, and Facebook have done so—possibly more than any other upstart companies in recent U.S. history. These now-mature businesses are grappling with how their world-changing ventures have broadly affected the economy and communications. And in the prevailing populist mood, the American public may be more inclined to hold these mega-firms responsible for less than desirable outcomes—fairly or not. All three tech giants came under the spotlight this week, facing different issues of public concern. —–Apple CEO Timothy Cook surprised CNBC “Mad Money” host Jim Cramer by announcing on the show Wednesday that Apple plans to devote $1 billion to a fund supporting the development of advanced manufacturing capabilities in the United States. The new initiative addresses a sore spot in the narrative of Apple’s meteoric rise—the charge that it sends its manufacturing jobs to China and other locations where wages are much lower and working conditions are suspect. As a presidential candidate, Donald Trump called Apple out for exporting jobs, and a Bloomberg feature last week focused on a huge iPhone manufacturing plant in Shanghai, where Apple maintains it has curbed alleged use of excessive overtime. But a watchdog group cited in the story, China Labor Watch, says workers must still work overtime just to meet their living expenses. With his sudden announcement this week, Cook didn’t promise to spend part of Apple’s new $1 billion fund to build iPhone factories in the United States. But the CEO said Apple will help create high-tech manufacturing jobs here, and hinted at the method. He said Apple is in talks to invest in an unnamed company, and may make an announcement about it later this month, according to CNBC’s write-up of the interview with Cramer. “A lot of people ask me, ‘Do you think it’s a company’s job to create jobs?’ and my response is [that] a company should have values because a company is a collection of people,” CNBC quotes Cook from the interview. “And people should have values, so by extension, a company should. And one of the things you do is give back,” Cook said. “So how do you give back? We give back through our work in the environment, in running the company on renewable energy. We give back in job creation.” Apple, with 80,000 U.S. employees, says it has already given rise to a total of two million jobs in the United States. It makes this case on a company website that now includes a state-by-state breakdown of the number of its staff members, stores, and suppliers, who make their own hires. The Apple employee count just unveiled ranges from its 36,786 workers in California to its four in North Dakota. Austin, TX, has 6,000 Apple employees, the company’s second-largest complement in the world. Apple also takes credit for 1.5 million jobs arising from its “App store ecosystem.” That would include app developers, but also non-tech staffers such as restaurant workers who benefit from the spending related to apps, as Associated Press reporters Michael Liedtke and Christopher Rugaber wrote in a story about Apple’s increasing drive to showcase its contributions to the American economy. In the AP story, Diane Swonk, CEO of DS Economics, says Apple is stretching its app ecosystem job claims too far. —Facebook has built a virtual community of almost two billion people, serving as a digital mailbox, a bulletin board, a TV station, and a news outlet of commanding reach. But in addition to sharing positive content—- from family milestones to important policy discussions—-Facebook has unintentionally broadcast live murders on video, fake news about political candidates, and stolen photos of undressed women Marines. On Wednesday, Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg accepted broader responsibility to regulate criminal and offensive behavior in the online community by pledging to add 3,000 more staffers to a global community operations team of 4,500. “Over the last few weeks, we’ve seen people hurting themselves and others on Facebook—either live or in video posted later,” Zuckerberg wrote in a company blog post. “It’s heartbreaking, and I’ve been reflecting on how we can do better for our community. If we’re going to build a safe community, we need to respond quickly.” The surveillance obligations Zuckerberg describes go beyond taking down things like racist and violent videos from the site. They also extend to coordinating with outside agencies to change real-world outcomes. “We’ll keep working with local community groups and law enforcement who are in the best position to help someone if they need it—either because they’re about to harm themselves, or because they’re in danger from someone else,” Zuckerberg wrote. The obligation to patrol the communications of billions of people is daunting, although artificial intelligence technologies could provide a big assist, Zuckerberg has said. But even expert human lawyers could have a hard time drawing up reliable rules that would banish a murder filmed by the killer, but keep video of the police shooting of a suspect available on the site because it informs the public about the actions of its government. Even subtler are the distinctions between fair comment protected by the First Amendment and an offense such as libel or cyberbullying. Beyond those dilemmas, though, Facebook has been accused of creating new kinds of societal jeopardy with algorithms that detect user preferences and feed back similar content to those users that may confirm their biases, or simply insulate them from a broader view of the world. It’s a problem that bright programmers might have a good time tackling. —Google, a perennial target of hackers because people conduct so much of their lives and work through its e-mail and other services, reacted to a big breach of its defenses this week. One of Google’s Twitter accounts, @googledocs, sent out a brief alert at 1:08 pm Wednesday: “We are investigating a phishing email that appears as Google Docs. We encourage you to not click through & report as phishing within Gmail.” As Recode described the situation in a headline three hours later: “A massive Google Docs hack is spreading like wildfire” Hackers impersonating Google Docs had sent deceptive e-mails inviting victims to look at a Google Doc allegedly shared with them by people or organizations the targets knew. The unfortunates who clicked through the scam messages opened their entire Google accounts to the bad guys, who could then re-broadcast the malicious message to all the victims’ contacts. John Wilson, field CTO at cybersecurity company Agari, wrote in an analysis that the hack was very effective because it didn’t use malware or other methods that would be picked up by cybersecurity defenses. “While we haven’t seen reports of fraud yet, the cybercriminals who launched the attack have access to all of the victims’ emails until the app is disabled,” Wilson wrote. “With that access, the criminals can use your identity to scam co-workers or relatives, reset your bank account password and steal money or harvest information to steal the victim’s identity. There are an infinite number of ways a cybercriminal can monetize this kind of access.” Google sent word via Twitter by 3:20 pm that it had removed the fake pages and malicious accounts used in the attack. Then it responded to the flood of tweets—–like a chorus of digital wails—from people who had fallen for the spoofing scam and clicked. The company tweeted out an address to go to for help deleting the app still controlling the victims’ data. Among the responses to Google’s advice was a particularly poignant tweet from @ladyaeva. “how do we know you’re the real google doctors,” she wrote.

In tech news this week, we’re tracking a new state-by-state jobs report from Apple, Microsoft Ventures’ latest A.I. investments, Seattle’s new broadband privacy rules, and Congresswoman Suzan DelBene’s new caucuses on reality (virtual and augmented) and digital trade. Another shot of the #lightning #storm tonight in #Seattle. This one is from a few shots layered, all the bolts are in the right place. #wawx pic.twitter.com/fFFXTCpnzq — Sigma Sreedharan (@sigmas) May 5, 2017 —Apple employs 1,131 people in Washington state across its new artificial intelligence and machine learning research and development center, and six retail stores. The company detailed its state-by-state economic impact on a new website emphasizing its U.S. job creation. CEO Tim Cook pledged a $1 billion investment in U.S. advanced manufacturing. (Xconomy’s Bernadette Tansey wrote about Apple’s manufacturing fund.) In addition to direct employment, Apple counted 81,100 jobs in Washington connected to its App Store ecosystem. Washington trails only California, New York, and Texas in the size of its App Store-related work force. Washington also has 189 Apple suppliers and 10 manufacturing facilities. —Microsoft Ventures made two more bets on artificial intelligence startups. The company invested in a $3.5 million seed round raised by its former accelerator tenant Agolo, a New York-based company making software to summarize large amounts of data in chats, voice, news, and video content. The corporate venture fund also backed Berkeley, CA-based Bonsai, which helps automate management of machine learning algorithms. Microsoft co-lead the company’s $7.6 million expansion of a Series A round. —We profiled Seattle-based clean energy startup LevelTen Energy, fresh out of Techstars Seattle, which aims to unlock the benefits of large-scale renewable energy contracts for corporations that don’t have the size or sophistication to enter into those contracts themselves. —Seattle Mayor Ed Murray used the city’s authority to regulate cable operators this week to issue a rule (PDF) requiring Comcast, CentryLink, and Wave to get permission from customers before sharing their Web browsing history or personally identifiable information. Murray made the move in response to the repeal by Congress of Federal Communications Commission broadband privacy rules, which had yet to take effect. —Congreswoman Suzan DelBene joined colleagues to form a “Reality Caucus” this week. At least that was the headline on a news release from the Washington Democrat and former technology executive. It turns out it’s actually a virtually reality caucus, focused on virtual, augmented, and mixed reality technologies. “These technologies have shown tremendous potential for innovation in the fields of entertainment, education and healthcare,” say the co-chairs of the caucus, including DelBene, and Reps. Yvette Clarke (D-NY), Bill Flores (R-TX), Darrell Issa (R-CA) and Ted Lieu (D-CA). “As these technologies develop, questions will inevitably rise in privacy, intellectual property and other areas. This is an opportunity to educate our colleagues and others to ensure Congress is doing all it can to encourage—rather than hinder—these enterprising fields.” DelBene also launched a Digital Trade Caucus, in the context of a wholesale re-examination of U.S. trade policy under the Trump administration, with goals including promoting a free and open Internet in support of manufacturers, service providers, and cross-border data flows; eliminating data localization requirements; and ensuring that trading partners do not require cloud platforms to filter speech. —Speaking of the Trump administration, Xconomy’s Bernadette Tansey took a look at the first 100 days from the perspective of the tech industry.

CEO Elon Musk Musk comments on speculation about Tesla as a possible acquisition target for Apple, the company's timeline for Model Y, his bullish outlook for energy storage sales, and more. Daniel Sparks (TMFDanielSparks) May 6, 2017 at 10:35AM As Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk typically does during the company's quarterly earnings calls, he shared key insighta about the business this week, including some comments on more speculative subjects. Commentary ranged from an update on what level of Model S and Model X sales Musk thinks Tesla can sustain, to his thoughts about the potential for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to buy Tesla.  Here's some of the most notable takeaways from Tesla's first-quarter earnings call (by way of an S&P Capital IQ transcript). Image source: author. Sustaining a 100,000-unit production rate for Model S and X In the past, Musk has indicated that he expected annual Model S and Model X deliveries to eventually hit a steady rate of about 100,000 units annually. While the company achieved this run-rate in its most recent quarter, some investors may be wondering whether the CEO still anticipates sustaining this level of production for the two pricey vehicles as its lower-cost, higher-volume Model 3 comes to market in July. Even as Model 3's launch approaches, it looks as if Musk still expects annual demand for the two vehicles to stay at this rate: We're going to produce 100,000 units approximately, so all that matters is there's demand. Is there going to be demand for 100,000 units? I believe there will be. And there is. Tesla CFO Deepak Ahuja added that there is "certainly sufficient demand" for Tesla's guidance for 47,000 to 50,000 total Model S and Model X deliveries during the first half of the year.  Apple hasn't shown interest in buying Tesla With Apple's cash hoard swelling to $257 billion in the company's most recent quarter, there's been some speculation that Tesla might be a good fit for a potential acquisition target for the tech giant. But Musk says Apple probably isn't interested anyway: I don't think they want to have a conversation [about buying Tesla]. I don't believe -- there's not been any indication that they do. Obviously, Apple company makes some great product. And yes, I mean, I use their phone and their laptop, it's cool. Musk added that he's unclear about what Apple wants to do "on the car front." Model Y is still a few years away Tesla has said that after its Model 3 production ramp-up, it plans to bring to market another SUV that's smaller than its Model X and closer in price to the $35,000 Model 3. But investors shouldn't expect the Model Y for another few years, Musk explained when he was asked about the company's goal to achieve annualized production of 1 million units annually by 2020: I think we need to come up with the Model Y sometime in 2020 or, aspirationally, late 2019. And then I think that 1 million units is quite likely -- combined, yes. Maybe more. Tesla's Powerwall 2 powering a home with Tesla solar tiles and a Model 3. Image source: Tesla. Musk thinks energy-storage sales are about to jump When asked about why Tesla's total energy-storage megawatt hours deployed declined sequentially, Musk said the pullback in the near term is normal. But he still has high hopes for energy-storage deployment growth toward the end of the year: With respect to the battery stuff, it's a little lumpy right now, because you're at a big installation in [the] fourth quarter with Southern California Edison. And then we had a bit of a gap between the Powerwall 1 to Powerwall 2. So we should start to see that correcting in Q2 and Q3, and then particularly toward the end of this year, I would expect quite a dramatic ramp in storage deployment, like really dramatic. While Model Y may be still too far away for investors to give it much weight, and any speculation that Apple might buy Tesla might as well be ignored, investors should certainly keep an eye on demand for the Model S and X as the Model 3 comes to market. In addition, investors should watch Tesla's energy-storage sales to see if the company's nascent energy business can deliver on Musk's bullish expectations.  Daniel Sparks owns shares of Apple and Tesla.

Alex Cranz | Gawker MediaMay 6, 2017, 07.19 PM IST FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedinReddit windows 10Image Credit Continue reading Image: Gizmodo It has been nearly two years since Microsoft introduced a new Windows phone. Sure, HP is still making Windows phones and marketing them to businesses, but Microsoft has been basically silent on the subject of its flagging mobile platform since 2015. There have been zero flagship devices, despite the persistent rumors of a super Surface phone . Logic dictates that Microsoft needs to get in the game here. People are increasingly moving away from their laptops and onto their smartphones, and if Microsoft wants to keep up with Apple and Google, it will need a convincing phone platform. Advertisement The company apparently has something in the works. According to Windows Central , Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella confirmed as much on the Marketplace podcast Make Me Smart earlier this week. "I'm sure we'll make more phones," Nadella told host Molly Wood, "but they will not look like phones that are there today." Advertisement Let's step back for a moment. Windows 10 on a phone today has two things going for it. First, the interface is gorgeous-sleek and minimalist, without any of the cutesy affectations that iOS and Android have collected over the years. Second, the phones function as mini PCs thanks to Continuum, so you can phone during the day and then dock it at your monitor and keyboard for a traditional PC experience at night. But the current version of Windows on mobile phones, Windows 10 Mobile, was introduced waaaaaay back in 2015 alongside Microsoft's last flagship, the Lumia 950 . (You'll recall that Microsoft took over the Lumia brand from old Windows Phone stalwart Nokia in 2013.) It's no surprise the next flagship is slow to appear. Windows for a phone was already late to the scene when Microsoft launched Windows Phone 7 in 2010. By then, Apple was a powerhouse with the iPhone, and Google had forged a worthy competitor with great Android devices like the Motorola Droid. But Microsoft's mobile look was so radically cool, it conceivably had a chance to be a true contender. At the time, even Gizmodo was enraptured . "Everything's different now," we wrote. Sponsored In a way that proved very true. Only instead of radically disrupting the mobile phone market, Microsoft saw itself playing a distant third fiddle to the titans, Apple and Google. Everything really was different. Microsoft was accustomed to making the best-selling OS, and its failure to find its way into the lucrative mobile market left Microsoft scrambling. First there was the massive Windows 8 redesign that spanned mobile and desktop devices. Then Cortana came in 8.1, giving Windows phones a digital assistant to rival Siri. In 2015, Microsoft introduced Continuum, which let phone users plug their devices into a monitor and keyboard and get a Windows experience similar to the one enjoyed by desktop users. But as cool as Microsoft's attempts at competing have been, the company has failed to break into the elite mobile OS inner ring. By the time it arrived, users had already bought into the Android and iOS ecosystems, and developers, who were already building apps for two mobile operating systems, had little desire to add a third, far less lucrative one to their roadmaps. Sure, the many iterations of Windows for phones looked nice enough, and had the backing of Microsoft, but its constant game of catch up with Apple and Google made the phones built for the platforms unappealing. "There's just no reason to choose a pricey Windows handset when Google and Apple offer way better options," Gizmodo's Mario Aguilar said back in 2015. That hasn't changed, and it's one of the reasons why, just last month , Android overtook Windows as the most installed OS in the world, according to one estimation. Advertisement Advertisement Hopefully, this two-year-long news void in the mobile phone market is the result of Microsoft working like hell to make something new. Microsoft can't gain a measurable share of the smartphone market (and thus interest from app developers) without first making a product consumers really want to buy, and it can't do that without wildly wowing us with hardware radically different than what the likes of Apple and Samsung currently provide. As we noted last year, smartphones have become universally so good they're boring , and they're also so expensive now, that people are moving away from the two-year purchase cycle. Microsoft not only has to make a great phone, it has to be a disruptive one-and there's no clear path to such a device apparent in the stable of phones on the market. In other words, Microsoft needs to blow our collective minds. Advertisement So what would a future Windows phone look like? Ahead of Microsoft's hardware event last week, we might have hoped for a cloud-based phone, but that dream was shuttered when the long-rumored Windows 10 Cloud was officially named Windows 10 S . Instead of being a window into the cloud computing future, Windows 10 S resembles lightweight Windows variations like Windows RT and Windows 8.1 with Bing. It's not cloud-based, but rooted in the computer and inextricably linked to Windows' wasteland of an app Store. And that Store isn't going to just improve overnight. As already noted, Microsoft needs a robust stable of developers in order to bring in mobile users, but developers want a large user base before they dedicate time and money to a platform. So Microsoft is left at a frustratingly cyclical impasse. Which means whatever we see is going to have to be so different, so wild, that neither developers nor consumers will care. Get cracking Microsoft. We're ready for that Surface Phone.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « The EU Commission is preparing to Lay Down new Digital Policies for Europe to Punish Apple and Google | Main May 06, 2017 Apple's SVP Worldwide Marketing Phil Schiller thinks that Echo-Like Devices should have a Display   Apple's App Accelerator officially opened in Bengaluru India in March. When Apple's SVP Worldwide Marketing Phil Schiller came to the Bengaluru office recently, India's 'Gadget 360' was able to ask Schiller a few questions. One specific question covered Amazon's Echo device that may have revealed an interesting point considering that a supply chain rumor this week claimed that Inventec had landed Apple's first order for an Echo-like device.   Gadgets 360: Personally, what are your thoughts on devices like Google Home and Amazon's Echo?   Phil Schiller: Well, I won't talk to either one specifically, [I] don't want to. My mother used to have a saying that if you don't have something nice to say, say nothing at all. So, instead, let's abstract the conversation just briefly to some of the general concepts and talk about those, because it's really interesting.   First of all, there is a lot of talk in the industry about voice-driven assistants and we believe deeply in voice-driven assistants that's why invest in Siri, but there is interest in a voice-only assistant, where there is no screen, and we think it's important to that there are times when it's convenient to simply use your voice when you are not able to use the screen. For example, if you're driving [and] you want Siri to work for you without having to look at the screen, that's the best thing. Or maybe you're across the room, and you want to ask Siri to change the song you were listening to - you don't have to walk over and back [and you can use Siri instead].   So there's many moments where a voice assistant is really beneficial, but that doesn't mean you'd never want a screen. So the idea of not having a screen, I don't think suits many situations. For example if I'm looking for directions and I'm using Maps, Siri can tell me those directions by voice and that's really convenient but it's even better if I can see that map, and I can see what turns are coming up, and I can see where there is congestion, I understand better my route, and what I'm going to do.   Or, for example, with photography, and one of the most popular reasons for our products is photography now, and photography requires a screen. So the idea of a device without a screen, well it's not really useful for that whole category of photos that we all share. and all the social networking apps that are now embracing photos more and more, well, it doesn't work really so great in voice-only assistants.   Or the biggest category of all of apps is games, and I have yet to see any voice-only games that, for me, are nearly as fun as the one that I play on my screen. And so I think voice assistants are incredibly powerful, their intelligence is going to grow, they're gonna do more for us, but the role of the screen is gonna remain very important to all of this."   Patently Apple posted a report in February "titled Amazon Reportedly Working on bringing both a Display and Possibly Telephony to Next-Gen 'Echo' Home Device." So well before Schiller's commentary, Amazon was already working on a next generation of Echo.   Even though Schiller's idea wasn't a fresh one, going into length about any device using a digital assistant like Siri should have a display at least gives us a hint that any future standalone Siri device from Apple is definitely going to have a display.   For more of the interview with India's Gadget 360, click here.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

The weekend has arrived once more, and that means it’s time to pause and catch our breaths, as we look back on another exciting week across the tech world. There were some major announcements, a few juicy rumors, and one or two surprises – and as ever, 7 Days is here to make sure you know exactly what’s been happening. Our journey begins this week in China, where authorities are apparently preparing to launch an alternative to Wikipedia, bringing together "the biggest, most high-quality author team" in the world. Underneath the obnoxiously large watermark in the image above, you'll see Fitbit's new smartwatch, which was revealed in leaked pictures alongside a new set of Bluetooth earbuds. Qualcomm is reportedly preparing to ask the International Trade Commission to enforce an import ban on iPhones entering the United States. Apple recently stopped paying royalties to some of Qualcomm's partners in China, amid a bitter dispute between the two companies over Qualcomm's licensing fees. Next week, Qualcomm will announce details of its new Snapdragon 660 processor chipset Mobile Platform for upper-mid-range devices. Rival chipmaker Intel finally patched a security vulnerability that has existed in some of its products for almost a decade. An email phishing scam attempted to ensnare users by linking to a shared Google Docs file, which routed users through a legitimate Google sign-in page, before a fake app requested authorization to access their emails. Meanwhile, Google made changes to Gmail's security warnings to offer greater protection against phishing attempts. O2, part of Spanish telecommunications giant Telefónica, revealed that some of its customers had had their bank accounts accessed by unknown third parties, as the result of a phishing attack combined with a known flaw in the SS7 protocol. A hacker, going by the name 'The Dark Overlord', leaked episodes of the upcoming season of hit Netflix show Orange Is The New Black, after the company ignored demands for a ransom payment. The same hacker claims to have possession of a further 36 unreleased movies and TV shows, and has again threatened to release them online unless a payment is made. Netflix content can now be viewed in 4K via the Microsoft Edge browser or the official Netflix app on Windows 10, thanks to a new preview driver from Nvidia for its GeForce GTX 10xx-series graphics cards. Samsung is hoping to attract more buyers to its Galaxy S8 flagships by offering them a free six-month Netflix subscription, 64GB microSD EVO+ card, and a Clear View Standing Cover. Samsung began rolling out a software fix for red-tinted displays on the Galaxy S8 and S8+ in Europe, and on T-Mobile in the US, but another issue popped up this week, causing some of those devices to randomly reboot. Buyers of LG's new G6 on T-Mobile can now get the device with $150 off, along with a free Google Home speaker and an LG G Pad X 8.0 tablet. LG is reportedly working on a 'G6 mini', which could prove popular among those who prefer a more compact flagship. HTC won't officially unveil its new U 11 flagship until later this month - but thanks to a leak, it seems we now know all of its key specs. OnePlus confirmed that its new Android flagship (gosh, there sure are a lot of flagships these days...) will be called the OnePlus 5, and will launch this summer. The company is skipping over the 'OnePlus 4' moniker as that number is considered unlucky in Chinese culture. Google published its latest breakdown of Android usage, revealing that just 0.5% of active devices are running the latest Android release, version 7.1. Android 7.0 is now up to just 6.6%, almost nine months after its rollout began. That long, slow rollout continues, reaching more devices this week: Samsung Galaxy S6, S6 edge and S6 active on AT&T Samsung Galaxy S6 edge+ on T-Mobile Samsung Galaxy A5 (2016) Honor 6X Google released its latest monthly Android security update, and published new factory and OTA images for its supported Nexus and Pixel devices. Details emerged of a new Android tablet in development by Motorola, with a 'premium look and feel', cellular connectivity, and a 'productivity mode', enabling users to pin apps to the nav bar. With Google's latest update to Chrome on Windows, version 58.0.3029.96, users with a 64-bit version of the OS running a 32-bit version of the browser will be automatically migrated to the 64-bit browser, if they have auto-update enabled. Google is getting ready to launch a major redesign of YouTube, including support for a dark theme - and it's got some big names onboard to support its stylish new look. Google and The Raspberry Pi Foundation teamed up to offer a low-cost cardboard kit that makers can use to build their own version of Google Home, including voice control support through the Google Assistant SDK. We've known since November that Amazon is working on a new Echo device, powered by its Alexa digital assistant, featuring a touchscreen and improved speakers - and the first images of that device appeared on Friday. Apple will reportedly unveil its own high-end rival to the Amazon Echo at its Worldwide Developer Conference next month. The new voice-controlled speaker is said to have a cylindrical design, similar to that of the Mac Pro, and - unsurprisingly - will support Apple's Siri digital assistant. Apple published its latest earnings report, revealing details of a very strong quarter for its services business, but a slight decline in iPhone sales, and a big drop in iPad sales. Apple promised to invest $1 billion in US manufacturing, and claimed that it's responsible for creating two million jobs across the country, despite only employing 80,000 people. Kensington released a new fingerprint scanner for PCs, priced at $50. The VeriMark sensor connects to a device via a USB port, and supports Windows Hello and FIDO. Toshiba's new Portégé X30 is a Windows 10 notebook that also supports Windows Hello biometric authentication, and promises enterprise-class security through a range of features, including TPM 2.0, BitLocker Drive Encryption, a Smart Card reader, and more, priced from $1,449. You don't need to spend a fortune to get Windows Hello support, though. The ASUS Transformer Mini is a 10.1-inch Windows 10 tablet that weighs just 790g with the keyboard attached, and has 4GB RAM, 64GB storage, and a kickstand similar to Microsoft's Surface tablets. The best bit is the price: it's now available in the US for just $249, including the keyboard and pen. Microsoft is offering some big discounts on its Surface products in the UK. All Surface Pro 4 models are now available with up to 19% off, while Surface Book i7 models (excluding those with the new Performance Base) can now be purchased with up to £665 off, along with free Bowers & Wilkins headphones worth £119.99. Microsoft also introduced its new Surface Arc Mouse, priced at $79.99, and available in three colors. Two of the Arc Mouse colors match those of the new Surface Laptop, which Microsoft unveiled on Tuesday at an education-focused event in New York City. Unlike previous Surface devices, the Laptop isn't attempting to define a new product category - beneath its (very!) pretty design, it's a surprisingly ordinary notebook, with its only truly distinguishing feature being the Alcantara fabric trim applied to its keyboard area. And while it has a touchscreen, and supports the Surface Pen, the display can't even be pushed back 180-degrees, so if you want to write on its screen, you'll have to do something like this: Here it is. RT @SurfaceProArt @thurrott From a reader at TabletPCReview forums. pic.twitter.com/1f8a71oNth — Paul Thurrott (@thurrott) May 4, 2017 The Surface Laptop certainly has premium pricing to match its premium styling - the entry-level model, which has just 4GB of RAM, and a 128GB SSD, costs $999, or £979 in the UK. For unexplained reasons, the four color options are only available on one model - the Core i5 version with 8GB RAM and 256GB SSD; but in the UK, and other markets, only the silver ("Platinum") color is offered across the entire range. And even though you could be paying up to $2,199 for the range-topping model, you'll still have limited connectivity options: you'll only get one USB 3.0 Type-A port, a Mini DisplayPort, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. There's no microSD slot, and no USB-C support either, even though one of Microsoft's own promotional videos showed a Surface Laptop prototype with two USB Type-C ports. Check out our hands-on first impressions of the Surface Laptop to find out more. The Surface Laptop is also the first device to come with the new Windows 10 S edition, previously known as 'Windows 10 Cloud'. Windows 10 S only allows apps to be installed from the Windows Store, offering more security on devices, and limiting the impact of malware and viruses. It should also deliver better battery performance, thanks to restrictions on background tasks and services for apps installed from the Store. It will also prevent users from changing the default browser (Edge) and search engine (Bing). Windows 10 S is primarily intended for the education market, but it still comes pre-installed on the Surface Laptop for consumers, although Microsoft is offering a free upgrade to Windows 10 Pro for those who buy the device until the end of the year. Anyone else who wants to upgrade a device that comes with Windows 10 S to the Pro edition will have to pay around $49 to do so. Since Windows 10 S devices can only run apps from the Windows Store, Microsoft also announced that its Office 365 desktop applications are also "coming soon" to the Store. Spotify is coming to the Windows Store as well - but as it will be a simple Desktop Bridge 'conversion' of its existing desktop app, it will only be available for Windows 10 PCs, and not for other devices like phones or the Xbox One. Cloud storage service MEGA will soon launch an app in the Windows Store too, built on Microsoft's Universal Windows Platform, and available on PCs and phones. By the way, Microsoft has another launch event coming up later this month. The company revealed on Thursday that it "will show the world what's next" at an event in Shanghai on May 23, where it's likely to unveil its new Surface Pro 5. Last weekend, Neowin exclusively revealed that Microsoft is planning to separate development of its Edge web browser from Windows 10 when it releases its next major update to the OS in September. The Windows 10 Creators Update, which is currently rolling out to consumers, is the most recent such update for the OS. This week, Microsoft detailed some of the improvements to Edge that that update includes for IT pros and enterprise admins. Meanwhile, Edge's share of the desktop browser market remains stagnant, while Chrome has increased its share to 63.45% since last month. Microsoft brought its Focused Inbox feature to Outlook 2016, making it available to all users in the Office 365 First Release program - a big step towards rolling it out for everyone. The company also released a new Outlook for Mac Insider Preview to the Fast ring, and finally added Outlook to its Office Insider Program on iOS. Microsoft Teams - the firm's "chat-based workspace" app for Office 365 - got a big update with some handy new features on iOS and Windows 10 Mobile. Last week, when Microsoft published its quarterly earnings report, I pointed out that its phone hardware business is now dead, with negligible revenue, and no new devices coming anytime soon. But Microsoft Technical Fellow Alex Kipman went even further this week, effectively declaring that the era of the smartphone is over: "The phone is already dead," he said. "People just haven't realized." Microsoft's CEO Satya Nadella had a slightly different take on things, saying: "I'm sure we will make more phones, but they will not look like phones that are there today." Could he be referring to Westworld-style foldable phones? Well... we can dream - but it's probably best not to get your hopes up. Microsoft is continuing to work on Windows 10 Mobile in a separate 'feature2' branch, having split its development from the main Redstone 3 (RS3) branch a few weeks ago. It released a new Windows 10 Mobile Insider Preview, build 15210, to the Fast ring on Wednesday. On the same day, Windows 10 build 16188 rolled out to PCs in the Fast ring from the RS3 branch, bringing a range of additions and improvements, including a new Cortana section in the Settings app, new Edge PDF Reader functionality, a better update experience, and more. The fixes and known issues for that build can be found here. It seems clear that Windows 10 development for PCs is currently proceeding at a far greater pace than for phones. Windows 10 has apparently reached a plateau on Valve's Steam gaming platform, after hitting an all-time high of 51.2% of gamers there last month. Valve announced an overhaul of its gifting system, and revealed a range of improvements to its customer support system. Xbox chief Phil Spencer said he believes that Microsoft's first-party studios should be "a beacon of innovation for how our platform is being used". He cited Gears of War 4 as an example of this, with its introduction of cross-play between Xbox One consoles and Windows 10 PCs. Gears of War 4 got its latest update this week, with two new maps, multi-GPU support on Windows 10 PCs, and more. Microsoft added five more Xbox 360 games to its list of those playable on the Xbox One through its Backward Compatibility program. That list has been growing fast lately, and it won't be long before it reaches the next milestone of 400 titles. Nearly 11 years after the original game was released, the new Prey made its official debut on the Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and PC. Nvidia's latest GeForce driver update includes optimizations for the game. Sony revealed that it will hold its media briefing at the E3 gaming expo on June 12. Expect to see plenty of exciting announcements there, including a ton of awesome new games. However, Oculus confirmed that it's giving E3 a miss this year - the first time the virtual reality firm will be absent from the show since 2014. But our odyssey across the tech world ends this week with the beginning of a new journey across all of time and space. BBC iPlayer - which is exclusively available in the UK - will be streaming a special edition of this week's episode of Doctor Who, featuring immersive 3D binaural audio. But if you're not in the UK (or even if you are), you can enjoy a new Skype game bot developed by BBC Worldwide and Microsoft, in which you can help the Doctor to discover the pieces of the Key of Time, "an ancient and powerful artifact than could decide the fate of the universe". I've suddenly got a craving for some fish fingers and custard... Bonus content Before we wrap things up for another week, let me first highlight a couple of extra bits around the site that I hope you’ll enjoy reading. Microsoft's spotlight was shining on its Surface Laptop this week, but the company also showcased a range of much more affordable PCs, some of which were priced as low as $229.

Apple executive Phil Schiller revealed he is not a fan of the Amazon Echo or Google Home smart speakers. Apple is reportedly working on its own rival product. Arjun Kharpal | @ArjunKharpal 17 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES Getty Images Phil Schiller, Apple A top Apple executive revealed he is not a fan of either Amazon's Echo or Google Home's speakers, amid speculation that the company could be releasing its own rival product. In a recent interview with Gadgets 360, Philip Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of worldwide marketing, took a dig at the devices—which have voice assistants built in. "My mother used to have a saying that if you don't have something nice to say, say nothing at all," Schiller said. Home and Echo both allow users to speak to them and get responses, or carry out "smart home" tasks like managing the thermostat and ensuring security. Apple has yet to release its own product, but a noted analyst recently said that the company is working on a device to rival Amazon and Google. "There is an over 50 percent chance that Apple will announce its first home AI product at WWDC in June," KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said in a note. WWDC is Apple's annual developers conference. Schiller did however give his thoughts on Siri, Apple's own voice assistant, and acknowledged that there are situations where a screen would not be needed. "For example, if you're driving (and) you want Siri to work for you without having to look at the screen, that's the best thing," Schiller said to Gadgets 360. "Or maybe you're across the room, and you want to ask Siri to change the song you were listening to - you don't have to walk over and back (and you can use Siri instead)." He added that while a voice assistant is "really beneficial" at times, having access to a touch screen device was still essential. "So the idea of not having a screen, I don't think suits many situations," the executive told the publication. "For example if I'm looking for directions and I'm using Maps, Siri can tell me those directions by voice and that's really convenient but it's even better if I can see that map, and I can see what turns are coming up, and I can see where there is congestion, I understand better my route, and what I'm going to do," Schiller said.

It’s from the anonymous creator of the Internet of Shit Twitter account. If you want to start an absolutely thrilling dinner table conversation with friends, try asking them what Internet of Things platform they’re using. Unsurprisingly, not many people know what IoT means, let alone what’s going on beneath their gadgets. All they care about is whether they work together or not — and most of the time they don’t. HomeKit, by Apple, was launched as a way to finally bring together all of your awful-but-slightly-useful internet gadgets for the home. Instead of dealing with a bunch of disparate standards promoted by different companies, Apple proposed a new ecosystem of smart home accessories that could be built securely on a series of common requirements. Then Apple would surface each one of those devices in Siri or, eventually, in its own Home app on iOS devices. Here’s the thing, though: the result isn’t really a logical evolution of what a “smart” home should look like. Being the ever-ironic person behind the Internet of Shit account, I own a ton of shitty internet-connected devices — despite how much I abhor them. At first, when I was starting out, I’d try to buy HomeKit-compatible ones to make life easier, but it’s amounted to little in the end. The peculiarities become obvious within a few minutes of using Apple’s Home app. Want to automate anything or control your devices remotely? Better go out and buy an Apple TV! Surprise! Better have an Apple TV or iPad at home. Apple This is crazy for many reasons, in no small part because millions of people, including myself, have an Airport router lying around that’s better suited for the job. Other home device makers, like Samsung’s SmartThings, have “hub” devices that take care of all of this for a reasonable price — spending an additional $149 for an Apple TV is not reasonable. Alternatively, Apple suggests using an iPad (starting price $329) for the home hub, but it must be “in your home, connected to your home Wi-Fi network, and powered on” at all times. Is this really the post-PC future we were promised?! Home app Apple Things get weirder once you’re set up with all your devices in the Apple Home app. I was lured into HomeKit by the promise of one app to rule them all — which it is, to an extent — but the Home app gives all of your light bulbs, humidity sensors, temperature sensors, and whatever else you have connected the same amount of precedence in the interface. After you’ve added a thermostat, a lock, some light bulbs, a doorbell, sensors, and maybe a security camera, the Home app displays a bunch of buttons that are all the same size and shape, some of which are actionable and others which are simply informing you it’s 70 percent humidity right now. The default Home app, which comes preinstalled on every iPhone, ends up being a useless sea of icons that’s difficult to navigate or search — there’s no way to hide devices, and even useless items like the Philips Hue Bridge, which does nothing more than connect your widgets to the internet, shows up as a button. There are third-party app alternatives which can tap into the standard underneath, but they’re limited in what Apple allows them to do. HomeKit is marred by Apple being the middle-aged dad of technology HomeKit itself, while a good idea in theory, is marred by Apple being the middle-aged dad of technology. It ignores newfangled cloud technologies entirely — you’re forbidden from storing any device logic in the cloud, for example — and would rather dictate from its own Silicon Valley bubble about what a smart home should look like, forcing device makers into subservient relationships in the process. The companies behind our devices, both big and small, must make hardware changes to be accepted into HomeKit, must add authentication chips that are only available from Apple, must choose an Apple-approved manufacturer, must send free samples for certification, and must not talk about the certification while hoping they don’t go bankrupt while waiting for the entire process to complete. Here’s an example of the frustration HomeKit creates: I bought Philips Hue lights a few years ago, and had been happily using them via the app provided by Philips. But if I wanted to get them working with HomeKit and the Home app I’d need to go out and buy an upgraded $59.99 bridge with Apple’s special chip just to get them talking — a change that could normally be done via a software upgrade. The same goes for other existing devices. If it didn’t ship with HomeKit support, you’ll have to replace it at your own cost to get it working later on. With Google Home, all I had to do was pair my existing Hue bridge and it worked immediately with my voice — no weird naming or specific phrases like “Siri, turn off Office Lights 2” required. I must concede that this rigor is a net positive: Apple’s approved HomeKit devices are presumably the least likely to suffer from IoT plagues like the Mirai botnet that famously took down millions of connected cameras. For many IoT manufacturers and their customers, the last thing they’re thinking about is security, as we’ve all seen. What frustrates me is that HomeKit ignores all previous work done to standardize the Internet of Things, leaving thousands of useful products incompatible. Because HomeKit is designed to be the secure all-encompassing platform for IoT devices for iPhone users, there’s no way Apple will ever include other standards because, by their definition, they’re stupid and insecure. This forces you, your family members, house guests, and anyone else in your home to commit to a phone platform for the long haul — an unreasonable ask. Ahhh, Apple's HomeKit finally brings it all together.* *Unless you're on Android. Fuck those guys. pic.twitter.com/zJvPc6KRPB— Internet of Shit (@internetofshit) October 22, 2015 HomeKit only advantages iOS users, not the billions of other device users out there. If you — or someone in your home — switches from iOS to Android, you might find yourself needing to replace your smart home one day. It’s incredibly “Apple” to exclude any other platform, a similar attitude to how the company deals with iMessage, AirPlay, FaceTime, and other technologies. But when you’re talking about the home, which is a far longer commitment than a two-year contract with your carrier, ecosystem lock-in is a huge problem. HomeKit also requires you to speak using painfully specific names for each device, which can mean it simply doesn’t work much of the time, and you have to recall the awkward naming scheme to actually get it to work. Home and Alexa are much more linguistically flexible in this regard. For example, you’re able to refer to “the lights” and the commands will just work. Siri on an iPhone is no match for an Amazon Echo or Google Home Voice is where the takes from Amazon and Google on the smart home really shine: you can control your home devices without being dependent on a smartphone. Apple can’t (but does) expect every man, woman, and child to have an iPhone or iPad with them at all times in the family home. An Amazon Echo or Google Home speaker with built-in microphones as your smart home interface makes a lot more sense, as it opens up your space for everyone to interact with the home in a far more natural way. Amazon is being particularly aggressive with its rollout: Alexa is now being integrated into kitchen appliances, speakers, lamps, TVs, and cameras, (even cars) which significantly lowers the barrier to making every room in your house smart. You can just speak aloud to your fridge — even though that’s ridiculous — to mute the music or turn off the lights. What I had hoped HomeKit would do is “just work” with a wide range of certified devices. But Apple’s vice-like grip on the program means it’s been slow progress in the three years since HomeKit was announced. And you’ll never see support for voice systems like Alexa or Home, so you’re stuck with Siri forever, along with a hope that rumors of an Echo-like device from Apple will one day bear fruit. Soon you’ll be choosing your smart home — like I did — based on the platform underneath, locking you to a bunch of devices that one filthy-rich company chose. And if you’re placing your bet on HomeKit, then you’ll be stuck with it and it alone for the long term, in a marketplace that’s evolving faster than Apple. Apple’s consumer lock-in is a smart play for its profit margin, but not for you or your home. Correction: An earlier version of this column wrongly said that Siri on Apple TV could not control HomeKit devices. We regret the error.

The latest set of quarterly earnings shows just how much profit they're generating from our increasingly technology-focused economy. In 2017, the biggest tech companies are just as big as Wall Street banks as they grow their market dominance. These companies own giant ecosystems of products that all tie into each other. Every time Apple sells an iPhone, the customer buys other services. Apple's cash hoard is $250bn - which is bigger than the market capitalisation of General Electric. It became the world's most valuable company back in 2011. Companies can't just rest on their laurels and hope to continue to perform with the products and services they have. Jack Kent, director of operators and mobile media, IHS Alphabet's market value is worth $607bn. It's the parent company of Google which runs two-thirds of all searches in the United States. Amazon's just introduced the Echo smart speaker to encourage customers to buy more of its services and products. The world's biggest online retailer just marked an eighth straight quarter without losses and has a market capitalisation of nearly $439bn. Facebook's latest figures revealed that it has 1.9 billion users worldwide and it expects to hit the two billion mark soon. It reported a 76.6 percent surge in quarterly profit on Wednesday driven by mobile ad sales. Jack Kent, director of operators and mobile media for the IHS Technology group, joins Counting the Cost to discuss the top five tech giants' earnings. "One of the most interesting things in these results is the nature of how expansive some of these ecosystems are, so while Apple's iPhone results got a lot of the headlines with relatively flat performance there, interestingly, its services business grew in app-store sales and app-store subscriptions. So, it's the variety of services that these companies offer which is really an interesting trend now," explains Kent. He believes that these giant companies will continue to innovate and a big part of their profits will continue to be allocated for research and development. "Companies can't just rest on their laurels and hope to continue to perform with the products and services they have, so you see lots of investment in new technologies - things like augmented reality and artificial intelligence, so they really position themselves for future growth as well." Also on this episode of Counting the Cost: US retail apocalypse: Is it real and what happens next, if as analysts say, the US mall sector is facing extinction? US retailers are going out of business. Some analysts are calling the rise in bankruptcy rates a retail apocalypse. Others say we're witnessing a paradigm shift within the industry. One of the oldest US brands, Sears, has also warned that it may have to close. Tom Ackerman reports from Maryland. Speaking to CTC is Gary Mortimer, associate professor of advertising, marketing and public relations at Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane, Australia. 'Inclusive growth' for Africa: The World Economic Forum on Africa was hosted by South Africa this year. The focus was on how to achieve "inclusive growth" for the continent through responsible leadership. But the host country's President Jacob Zuma is facing pressure over his reported ties to the rich. Mohamed Vall reports from Durban. Made in China: The first large Chinese-made passenger jet has taken off on its maiden flight, a key milestone for a country seeking a place in the global aviation market. The C919 single-aisle jet, which can hold up to 168 passengers, soared over Pudong International Airport in the commercial hub Shanghai as a crowd of thousands cheered. Canada maple syrup: Maple syrup is Canada's economic and cultural mainstay. Quebec province produces 80 percent of what's consumed around the world, largely through a strict system of quotas and price controls. But as Daniel Lak reports from Oka near Montreal some farmers who want to opt out are facing huge fines.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple Chooses Bosch for Sensors that Support Augmented Reality, In-Air Gestures, Indoor Navigation & Smart Glasses | Main | Apple's SVP Worldwide Marketing Phil Schiller thinks that Echo-Like Devices should have a Display » May 06, 2017 The EU Commission is preparing to Lay Down new Digital Policies for Europe to Punish Apple and Google   Back in April 2015 Patently Apple posted a report titled "European Regulators Sticking their Nose into Apple's Streaming Music Business before it even gets off the Ground." In August 2015 we posted a follow-up report titled "The EU Commission ends one Apple Music Probe while considering another." In that report we noted that "The European Commission failed to find evidence of collusion among the major music labels and Apple to quash free music streaming services such as those offered by Spotify."   Even with that finding, the EU appeared to be continually fishing for anything it could get on Apple that would allow them to open a new probe in an effort to punish U.S. tech companies and give European companies an edge.   So the EU Commission asked Spotify and other music streaming services for information pertaining to Apple's mobile App Store. Regulators were seeking information on the restrictions Apple places on apps offered through the store. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission similarly was exploring whether Apple's treatment of rival streaming music apps in the App Store violate antitrust laws. We covered that story back in July 2015 (one and two).   On March 29, 2017 we posted a report titled "New Analytical Report on Streaming Music Shows that Apple Music has taken the Lead in Unique Users by a Long Shot." Considering that Spotiy is considering an IPO later in 2017, this wasn't good news for them.   So what's Spotifiy's next move? We learn from a new Financial Times times report that "Spotify and a host of European internet businesses have called on Brussels to crack down on what they see as troubling practices by the likes of Apple and Google.   Big internet platforms 'can and do abuse their privileged position,' according to a letter signed by the chief executives of Spotify, music streaming rival Deezer and German start-up investor Rocket Internet among others.   Although the letter to the European Commission does not cite the Silicon Valley giants by name, it complains that some mobile operating systems, app stores and search engines have evolved from 'gateways' into 'gatekeepers' — effectively hindering rivals from competing with their own services. Apple and Google together control well over 90 per cent of mobile operating systems.   The letter comes in the midst of a debate inside the commission around overhauling digital policy, with new proposals due later this year aimed at addressing allegedly unfair contractual clauses enforced by big platforms."   In other words, the EU needed to have old grievances against Apple and Google revived so that they could justify their new digital policies that will no doubt come crashing down against Apple and Google in Europe. Even though their probes cleared Apple, they will now ensure to frame the argument according to their new rules to give European companies an edge.   It appears that the EU Commission is drunk with power. Jean-Claude Junker, the president of the EU Commission recently made it clear that Europe is growing twice as fast as the U.S. and that English is "losing importance in Europe." So with their new found power is it any wonder that they wanted to start a war with the U.S. on the technology front by striking at Apple first to set a precedent?   But that was just the beginning, the Financial Times report added that the EU Commission's new Digital Policy "Options being considered by the EU's executive arm range from sector-specific codes of conduct, to an independent dispute settlement body that would settle rows between big platforms and their often smaller business customers.   In the letter, the chief executives write that this mismatch requires 'specific rules guiding the interactions between platforms and their business users.' Normally, a company abusing its dominant market position would be covered by competition law.   But such cases take too long and cost too much for smaller internet companies, hence the need for extra regulation, they argue.   Common complaints from the companies include not being able to access customer data when they sign up through an app store, as well as big companies promoting their own services over third parties'.   Within the European Commission, there is a debate over how to approach the topic, with some calling for a cautious, narrow approach, while others are demanding that Brussels do more to rein in the likes of Google and Apple. Officials are also wary about being perceived as anti-American." Perceived? The EU is clearly anti-American on so many fronts, so this is nothing new.   It's clear that the EU Commission is out to force U.S. companies to abide by rules that favor European companies. Instead of a European company creating an OS for Europeans, they'll do the easier thing, force U.S. companies to bow to the world's ever growing economic power, Europe. We'll see how this plays out once the EU makes their new digital policies known later this year.   In the end, Spotify couldn't get US Authorities to break Apple as they wanted, so the EU Commission will now come to their rescue. What a joke. The reality is that the EU Commission knew that their new digital policies that are in the works are going to hurt Apple and Google and they needed a front argument to justify their moves. Spotify just happens to conveniently give them the excuse they need to hit U.S. tech companies.

Repatriation Cook revealed that to fund Apple's advanced manufacturing project, Apple will have to borrow $1 billion, so it does not have to pay taxes on its $256 billion it has stashed overseas. The CEO said that both repatriation and comprehensive tax reform would help make sense of this convoluted system. "If you sell globally, you earn money globally. If you earn money globally, you can't bring it back into the United States unless you pay 35 percent plus your state tax," Cook said. "You look at this and you go, 'This is kind of bizarre.' You want people to use this money in the United States to invest more." 2. Developers As Apple's massive developer community grows, Cook said that the company never stops asking itself key questions such as, "How can we empower the next generation of developers? How can we touch even more people? How can we train more people to code so they can pursue their passion?" When Cramer asked if Cook would ever put money behind this mission, Cook replied: "We would. We would, and we will, and you'll be hearing more about that across the summer." 3. Apple Watch Aside from Wall Street's bearishness on iPhone sales, which Cook said were caused by rumors of a new phone coming in late 2017, the company saw growth across the board. "We had a great quarter. If you get into the numbers just a little bit for a few minutes, the Mac grew 14 percent. This is huge. Services continued this really fast growth. It grew 18 percent year on year and we continue to be on target to be a Fortune 100 company this year with our services business. The Watch almost doubled year on year," Cook told Cramer. During the first quarter of this year, the Apple Watch grew so dramatically that it overtook the struggling Fitbit to become the largest wearable tech vendor. 4. Supply and Demand When Cook mentioned that the iPhone 7 Plus was doing incredibly well in China, seeing double-digit growth year on year, Cramer asked the CEO if the quarter would have looked different had Apple produced more of that smartphone model. "No, I wouldn't say that, because I feel that we were in supply-demand balance at the beginning of the quarter," Cook replied. 5. Setting Records Though Samsung seems to have recovered from its exploding phone scare, Cook was not worried about Apple customers switching to the Galaxy phones. Instead, the CEO said that Apple actually set records both for how many people switched to Apple from other providers, and for how many people in the world upgraded their phones. "On the switcher side, we were very pleased that we set a record for switchers outside of China for the first six months of this fiscal year. As you know, we start in October and we just finished the first half in March," the CEO explained. "We set a record there and we set a record for upgraders across the world. And so this felt really good." Questions for Cramer? Call Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC Want to take a deep dive into Cramer's world? Hit him up!

Tech Search Search Warren BuffettWarren Buffett Says Berkshire Hathaway Stock May Start Paying Dividends Warren BuffettWarren Buffett Says Artificial Intelligence Will ‘Hurt’ Berkshire Hathaway’s Business Berkshire Hathaway 2017Warren Buffett: Not Buying Google Is Berkshire Hathaway’s Biggest Mistake Kentucky DerbyHow to Bet on the Kentucky Derby Online Apple CEO Tim Cook.  Photograph by Astrid Stawiarz/Getty Images for RFK Human Rights Best Companies Apple’s iPhone Surprise Don Reisinger May 06, 2017 Apple's week was full of surprises. In announcing earnings on Tuesday, the company surprised many investors by disclosing that iPhone unit sales fell 1% from the same period a year earlier to 50.8 million. It was one of the few worrisome details in an otherwise strong quarter. While earnings factored heavily in this week's discussions, it was by no means the only big Apple news. Construction of Apple Park, the company's new Cupertino, Calif. headquarters, appears to be making good process based on a new video of the site taken from a drone. Another Apple nugget that got attention this week was that the company is working on a smart home hub—a competitor to Amazon's Echo— that may be unveiled at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference next month. This is Fortune’s weekly roundup of the biggest Apple news this week. To see last week’s roundup, click here. Read on for all this week's Apple news from the past week. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter This week, Apple announced earnings for the three months ending April 1, revealing that it had $52.9 billion in revenue. IPhone unit sales fell, but the iPhone division's revenue was up 1% year over year because of a higher average selling price. Mac sales rose 14%. Apple's Services division, which includes its Apple Music, continues to soar, with revenue growth of 18%. Even the company's Other Products division, which includes AirPods and the iPod, returned to growth, with revenue jumping 31%. Apple's disappointing iPhone sales surprised some analysts who had anticipated increased unit sales. In a conference call with analysts, Apple CEO Tim Cook explained the decline by saying that recent rumors about the company's new iPhones depressed sales. Cook said that anticipation for the expected devices, which could be announced later this year, prompted some iPhone owners to hold off buying new phones because they wanted to see if new models were coming. Apple's iPad is the most popular tablet with a 24.6% market share, according to IDC. However, iPad shipments tumbled 13% in the first three months of this year, IDC said. Overall, manufacturers shipped 36.2 million tablets in the first quarter, an 8.5% decline. Consumers are increasingly turning to lightweight notebooks and two-in-one hybrid computers, putting pressure on tablets to keep pace. So far, they haven't. Apple Park is coming along nicely. Documentarian Matthew Roberts published his latest video of Apple's headquarters. It showed that the main building, which will have 2.8 million square feet of floorspace, is nearly completed, and that construction crews are installing trees and landscaping. Apple employees are expected to start moving in soon. The moving process for all 12,000 employees is likely to take at least six months. For months, Apple has been rumored to be working on a smart home hub that would let users play music and control devices throughout their smart homes. Now, Ming-Chi Kuo, an Apple analyst at KGI Securities, says the company may unveil the device in June at its Worldwide Developers Conference. The device could come with built-in speakers and run on Apple's virtual personal assistant Siri. It also may also be more expensive than the $180 Echo, according to rumors. Apple, however, hasn't confirmed it's working on such a device. AirPods are a hit. Apple's wireless earbuds are already hard to find on store shelves, and according to a study this week from researchers Creative Strategies and Experian, 98% of owners surveyed say they're either "very satisfied" or "satisfied" with them. That's a higher satisfaction than the iPhone received in 2007 at the same time in its lifecycle. One more thing...If you have hundreds of thousands of dollars burning a hole in your pocket and you want to meet Tim Cook, now's your chance. He's auctioning a lunch with him to benefit the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights charity. The lunch is valued at $100,000, but bids already top $345,000. The auction ends May 16.

We are talking about Berkshire Hathaway's chairman Warren Buffet. Though he owns shares in Apple, he doesn't use iPhone. He doesn't use even a smartphone. He still sticks to his old flip phone. “I don’t throw anything away until I’ve had it 20 or 25 years,” Buffett told CNN in an interview in 2013 after he proudly showing off his Nokia flip phone and saying, “This is the one Alexander Graham Bell gave me.”   bccl His habit of sticking to things for long comes from his market wisdom — don't buy a stock if you are not willing to keep it for 10 years.  reuters/representational image Since he doesn't even use email — he has sent only one email so far — many tend to think he is a Luddite, one having an irrational fear of new technology. No, Buffett is just a frugal and practical man who wants to live life on his own terms.  Though the world's second richest man, Buffett still lives almost the same way he used to when he started out. He lives in the same small three-bedroom house in Omaha that he bought in 1958 for $31,500.  Till 2014, Buffett drove an eight-year-old Cadillac. “I only drive about 3,500 miles a year so I will buy a new car very infrequently,” he had said in an interview. CEO of General Motors had to convince him to upgrade to a new car. Buffett replaced his 2006 DTS with a brand new Cadillac XTS in 2014. Though he owns a private jet, he travels in it only for urgent business meetings.  ap Buffett's credibility as an investor is so high that his listeners value each word he utters. He is known to have bucked the trend many times. That's all because he lives an original life without getting influenced by trends. His life away from the fads of the day gives him the capability to see through the haze.  Don't Miss Tim Cook Believes India's Impressive 4G Rollout And Rising Incomes Will Boost Apple's Growth Apple's Badly Designed Calculator Hid A Backspace Function From iOS Users For Over Seven Years 36.4K SHARES Iraq Has Chosen Its First Beauty Queen Since 1972, Here's All You Need To Know About Her 32.3K SHARES Man Transforms Autorickshaw Into Scorpio, Anand Mahindra Gifts Him A New 4-Wheeler In Return 26K SHARES Yogi Adityanath's Ambitious 'Annapurna Bhojanalayas' Promise Full Meals For The Poor At Just... 24.8K SHARES Buffett's famous advice to young people is — stay away from credit cards and invest in yourself.  Behind his simple and original lifestyle is another of his famous maxim—money doesn’t create man; it is the man who created the money.

(Jason DeCrow/AP Images for Microsoft) Microsoft's new Windows 10 S system, which the company showed off Tuesday, looks like a direct competitor to Chrome OS, the operating system that powers Google's low-cost Chromebooks. (Jason DeCrow/AP Images for Microsoft)   Hayley Tsukayama The Washington Post     Microsoft just held a big launch in New York, but it didn't show off flashy new software or a pricey new piece of hardware for the average consumer. Instead, it gathered media and analysts together to talk about going back to school. The company announced a slew of products for the education market on Tuesday, including a school-focused version of Windows, new features for Office and a new type of laptop targeted at college students. All of its announcements aim to get more of its technology into the hands of more students -- regardless of their abilities or economic status. "Talent is everywhere. Opportunity is not," said Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella, who opened the presentation with a personal story about how his great-grandfather's education paved the way for his own success. Competition in the education space has been ramping up in recent years, as Google's inexpensive Chromebook laptops have shaken Apple's long-standing association with education. Chromebooks made up 58 percent of K-12 mobile-device shipments late last year, according to estimates from the consulting firm Futuresource -- a gain of 50 percent from the year before, while Microsoft made up 22 percent and Apple's iOS and MacOS together captured 19 percent. Microsoft, after years of focusing on business customers, is refocusing some of its efforts on the lucrative education market as part of a broader strategy to attract creative users. That was clearly the target market for the $999 Surface Laptop, which boasts an impressive 14.5 hours of battery life, as compared with the 10 to 12 hours from Apple's MacBook line. Its touch screen also works with the Surface Pen stylus, and the laptop is compatible with the Surface Dial -- features that Microsoft hopes will attract users who want to move beyond the keyboard and trackpad. With its new Surface Laptop, Microsoft is taking steady aim at Apple and its popularity among college students. The laptop's sleek design echoes the clean lines of the MacBook Air and MacBook, but the four extra hours of battery life could make it easier to finish an after-class library study session without having to haul around a charger all day. The $999 laptop isn't exactly a budget device, but it fits a critical audience that may not be able to afford Microsoft's high-power $1500 Surface Book. "This fills an important gap in their device offerings," said Christopher Voce, an analyst at Forrester, who expects that this new device will be critical to Microsoft's Surface line in the future. The company's new Windows 10 S system, which the company showed off Tuesday, looks like a direct competitor to Chrome OS, the operating system that powers Google's low-cost Chromebooks. Users will only be able to install programs from the Windows store, including its Office Suite, that are similar to the stripped-down options that come on Google's lightweight laptops. The system is due out before the new school year. Microsoft also announced new Office features, including upgrades to OneNote, Word and PowerPoint, to make all of them easier for people with learning or physical disabilities to use. For example, there's an Office feature that will read text aloud at various speeds, and separate words into syllables, which can be particularly useful for those with dyslexia. Those features make a world of difference to her students, said Lauren Pittman, a special-education teacher in Canton, Georgia, whose students were allowed to test the features before they were officially announced. Her students are "so much more confident, that's the biggest thing," Pittman said, because the features let them learn at their own speed and spare them the embarrassment of having to have a staff member read their class materials with them. Other features, such as built-in support for the screen readers that the visually impaired use to read documents on a computer, also make it much easier for teachers, students and parents to interact and communicate -- offering the opportunities that Nadella said he wants the company to provide for all students. From a business standpoint, locking up the lucrative education market -- in which companies often sell hundreds or even thousands of devices at a time -- is critical for any company that makes hardware, analysts said. It also has a sort of "hearts and minds" aspect to it, Voce said. "You're indoctrinating students into a way to engage with technology. The manner in which we use devices and apps is influenced by what we use in school," he said. For Microsoft, which has refocused its message around "creators" and the liberal-arts set that has traditionally belonged to Apple, being able to boost student creativity and productivity is critical to appealing to a new generation.

Home Apple News Apple Rumors iPhone iPad iPod Mac Apple TV Apple Watch About iPhone Share on Facebook IPhone 5s, is it worth buying in 2017? We were not all born with an iPhone in hand. A lot of iOS users have migrated from other platforms, into the grandiose ecosystem of Apple to be stuck forever in its stability and fluidity. However, not everyone wants to risk an iPhone 7 of almost 800 euros. However, we always have other options. The iPhone 5s, an intelligent device launched at the end of 2013, has become one of the most characteristic terminals of Cupertino. Even its design was relaunched as a special edition with the output of the iPhone SE. One of the main drawbacks that people often put to the iPhone 5s is its time in the market. The Apple terminal has been on the market for almost four years, but that has not been a determinant to stop seeing it everywhere. The iPhone 5s was released in September 2013 but is still updated to the latest version of iOS. In addition, it was Apple’s first device to have a 64-bit chip and Touch ID, so, despite taking time between us, you can keep the guy in front of your older siblings. An affordable entry to iOS The iPhone 5s could be said to be the father of all the iPhone that followed. It came with great features, such as the new 64-bit architecture on its A7 chip and the Touch ID fingerprint reader. In addition, it was the first to include a larger screen, although it was not so much the difference.   Currently, the device can be upgraded to the latest version of iOS 10.3.1, and is expected to do so to iOS 11 – some media even speculate an iPhone 5s in iOS 12, but that remains to be seen. In addition, most applications currently require an iPhone 5s or higher, so no problem running any of them.   The fluidity of the iPhone 5s is frankly good, taking ahead of some competitors in the same price range. In addition, there are only three chips behind the iPhone 7 Plus. If you want to start your adventure in the world of iOS but do not have a budget too high, the iPhone 5s could be the right terminal for you. If you decide to stay later, you can always opt for another terminal of higher category like the iPhone SE or the next iPhone 8. Share on Facebook New Posts IPhone 5s, is it worth buying in 2017?

Apple has leapt to the lead in wearable computing on strong sales of it smartwatch, a market survey shows. The survey released Thursday by Strategy Analytics showed Apple grabbed a 15.9 percent share of the wearables market in the first quarter. While Apple does not release sales figures for its Apple Watch, the estimate by Strategy Analytics showed a 59 percent jump in slaes from a year earlier, with 3.5 million units sold in the first three months of the year. "The new Apple Watch Series 2 is selling relatively well in the US, UK and elsewhere, due to enhanced styling, intensive marketing and a good retail presence," said Strategy Analytics executive director Neil Mawston. Fitbit, which has been a longtime leader of the wearables market with its fitness bands, slipped to third place on a 36 percent slide in sales in the first quarter, the research firm said. The survey found that China's Xiaomi, which makes a budget-priced fitness band, was the second-largest vendor with a 15.5 percent global market share, ahead of Fitbit's 13.2 percent. "Fitbit has lost its wearables leadership to Apple, due to slowing demand for its fitness bands and a late entry to the emerging smartwatch market," said Strategy Analytics researcher Cliff Raskind. "Fitbit's shipments, revenue, pricing and profit are all shrinking at the moment and the company has a major fight on its hands to recover this year." Overall, the report said sales of wearables rose 21 percent from a year earlier to 22 million units, led by stronger demand for new smartwatch models.

Bad religion: The easy explanation for Apple success Mythperceptions: No, Apple is actually pretty good at design Video Can the iPhone make better AR than Facebook and Snapchat? | The iPhone Show You’ve got to spend money to make money the old adage says and if that’s the case then it might as well be someone else’s money you spend, right? That at least seems to be the philosophy of Wall Street analysts covering Apple, who are now salivating at the idea that the company will benefit from a tax holiday and be able to repatriate $220 billion. “Citi sets odds on Apple's M&A target.” Citi is a very big company that pays people a lot of money to analyze stocks for investors to help them make smart decisions. Or, that’s what this Citi marketing material says, anyway. In reality, apparently, they pay people to write Apple acquisition porn. The Macalope doesn’t know why they do that — since what Citi analyst Jim Suva thinks Apple will do has about as much chance of happening as randy, good-looking pizza delivery people showing up on your doorstep does — but they do. Suva’s odds seem… pretty unlikely. The Citi handicapping puts 40% odds on a Netflix buyout… [spit take] Great. There goes another monitor. The Macalope finally had to switch to having his MacBook drive a monitor because he was going through too many MacBooks by spitting coffee, water, gin or flames of indignation at what his job forces him to read onto them. Ideally Apple’s upcoming monitors will at least be splash resistant like the Apple Watch Series 1 if not water-resistant up to a depth of 50 meters like the Series 2. Really, though, it’s 2017. If your monitor isn’t water-resistant up to a depth of 50 meters then shut the company down and give the money back to the shareholders. The Macalope doesn’t know this for a fact but he presumes someone announced such a monitor at CES this year. Giving money back to the shareholders, though, brings up what Apple actually might do with its cash windfall. As Neil Cybart notes, it’s not to acquire Netflix, Disney, Tesla or the world’s biggest party sub, all but one of which Suva included odds for (frankly, the Macalope thinks the party sub has a better chance). If Apple brings back foreign cash due to U.S. tax reform, share buyback will be the most likely use of that cash. Which is a kind of ironic twist to Michael Dell’s famous quote about the company. Apple is giving money back to the shareholders, just because it was incredibly successful, not because it’s shutting down. Looked at another way, Apple is saying the more valuable use of its money is buying itself, not some other company. The fact that Wall Street analysts don’t see that is pretty much par for the course. To comment on this article and other Macworld content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Smartphones Ever wondered why iPhone's calculator doesn't have a backspace key? The calculator app in iOS devices had the backspace function ever since iOS 4. Sami Khan   May 6, 2017 16:51 IST Apple iPhone 7REUTERS/Regis Duvignau Apple iPhones and iPads do not come cheap and consumers are still willing to shell out the top dollar. Among other things such as brand recognition and the quality of the devices, Apple devices are popular for the experience they offer to users. It is not new that Apple has a closed operating system unlike the open nature of its biggest rival, Android, but the company has managed to make that one of its key USPs. Android devices have several features and apps that are unavailable on iOS, which may make iPhone and iPad users green. Now, owners of Apple-made products can strike off one feature, albeit small but thoroughly useful, from the list of features Android users have and iOS doesn't. Calculators are pretty common in every smartphone, be it Android, iOS or even Windows. Even though we use the calculating apps quite often, we don't really demand any updates or try to compare it with different versions of OS. But somewhere deep down in your gut, iOS users must have wondered why there's no backspace function in their iPhone. What if we told you that the calculator app in iPhone and other iOS devices had the backspace function all along? It's true. According to a three-year-old Reddit thread, instruction on how to use backspace function in iPhones has been around since iOS 6 or even before that. Before you go ahead and open the stock calculator app on your iOS devices to start looking for a dedicated backspace button, hold up right there. It's not a dedicated button that you should be looking for. The backspace function on the stock iOS calculator app works by swiping either left or right on the display of the calculator. Now that you've tried and realized it actually works, try not to control that grin on your face. For what it's worth, you don't even have to be embarrassed as you are not alone to learn this secret feature actually existed on your phone for several years. You can do a simple search on Twitter for "iPhone calculator" or "iOS calculator" to make yourself feel better. Trevor: ELI?!?!?!? Me: What?! Trevor: YOU CAN BACKSPACE ON THE IPHONE CALCULATOR?!

Home Apple News Apple Rumors iPhone iPad iPod Mac Apple TV Apple Watch About Apple TV Share on Facebook How to take screenshots on the Apple TV 4 Whether to show someone your last score on that fun game on Apple TV or to refer some tvOS advice to a friend, you can share screenshots from your TV. In this article, we’ll explain how you can capture an image of your fourth-generation Apple TV. The Apple TV 4 has a USB-C port that will allow you to connect the device to a Mac to run iTunes. Next, we will use it to allow Xcode or QuickTime to facilitate our capture of images. How to capture a fourth generation Apple TV screen In case you are using a Mac in any of its variants, you will need a USB-A to USB-C cable. On Amazon, there are some available for $ 11 so you will have no problem getting it. 1. Connect your Apple TV to your PC / Mac. 2. Sign up for the Apple Developer Center. 3. Download and install Xcode. 4. Start Xcode. 5. Open the “Window” option. 6. Select “Devices”. 7. If all goes well, you will notice how the fourth generation Apple TV appears on the next screen. Click on it to access all the information besides showing the button “Take Screenshot”. Unfortunately Xcode will not offer you an image preview of the screenshot on your PC / Mac but you will hear the typical camera sound when performing the screenshot. Alternatively, you can also use QuickTime. From File> New Video Recording and selecting the fourth generation Apple TV. QuickTime can be used for both video recording and audio recording. In conclusion, taking a screenshot on the Apple TV is not so difficult if you follow these steps to the letter. However, the process is somewhat convoluted. Hopefully Apple will, in the near future, upgrade the tvOS software to allow users to take screenshots with a simple tap or tactile gesture of the Siri Remote.

According to the Verge, iPhone sales were flat in the first part of 2017. In fact, they were less than flat; sales were down by one percent. However, the price point for the high-end smartphone was higher, which contributed to an overall increase in revenues of 4.5 percent over last year. However, the sale of 50.76 million iPhones only accounts for just over half of the $53 billion the fruit phone producer raked in and it is usually higher. Apple CEO Tim Cook blames rumors of the iPhone 8 for the depressed sales and expects the last half of 2017 to be outstanding for the company. Where the company really opened strong was in wearables. Apparently, the Apple Watch has been selling like hotcakes. Sales for the all-in-one gadget were nearly double over last year. In fact, one might even say that wearables are what is propping up the iPhone's lackluster sales. "Overall revenue from sales of [Apple] wearable devices, including watches and headphones, is larger than a Fortune 500 company — worth at least $5.1 billion." – The Verge The Series 2 Apple Watch is doing quite well worldwide. According to Engadget, the device has beat the sales figures of every other major wearable competitor out there for Q1 2017. Overall sales of Apple wearables are up nearly 60 percent over last year. The company sold 3.5 million wearables in the first part of this year and finally kicked Fitbit out of its first place spot. The fitness bracelet producer only sold 2.9 million units in the first quarter, a decline of 36 percent compared to the same period last year. In fact, Fitbit did not just get ousted out of first place by Apple, but wearable maker Xiaomi also overtook the company, leaving it in third place for the quarter. The first round of watches out of Cupertino has begun to come under some scrutiny lately due to a problem with battery expansion. It is too early to tell if these problems will affect sales of Series 2 watches during the rest of 2017, but Cook expects iPhone sales to rebound with the release of the iPhone 8. Of course, that is as long as it is released in 2017. There have been rumors the handset may be delayed due to design issues related to the fingerprint sensor.

Home Apple News Apple Rumors iPhone iPad iPod Mac Apple TV Apple Watch About Apple Rumors iPhone 8 iPhone 8 Rumours Share on Facebook 3 reasons why the iPhone 8 will cost more than a 1000 euros The iPhone 8 or iPhone Edition will land in the market this fall from the hand of the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus, and although it seems a saturation, there will be a market for all. And is that the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus will follow the fantastic wake initiated by the iPhone 7 erecting as a smartphone even faster and powerful, but with similar specifications and aesthetics. Because all the innovation will go towards the iPhone 8 and that has a cost. The iPhone 8 will be the truly revolutionary new iPhone in terms of the design of the last years after the iPhone 6, initiating a new cycle that is estimated to achieve unprecedented sales. The success of the new terminal is beyond doubt, by Apple itself and the market specialists. So much so that Apple is preparing a large initial stock of its iPhone 10 special tenth anniversary anticipating the colossal sales, although it is speculated that this will cost more than a thousand euros. Do you want to know why? Contents These are the reasons why the iPhone 8 will cost more than a thousand euros Display AMOLED  A revolutionary front camera  Wireless charge One more thing … These are the reasons why the iPhone 8 will cost more than a thousand euros Display AMOLED The iPhone 8 will be the first and only iPhone of 2017 that will have an AMOLED screen. It will also be bigger than ever: 5.8 inches in the same space as a Plus model thanks to a redesign that will eliminate virtually all edges and integrate the Home button on the screen. With AMOLED technology the screen will be sharper and brighter than ever with a resolution of 2K and a screen ratio that could exceed 2: 1, but also its consumption will be much lower. But AMOLED technology is expensive and that undoubtedly raises the price of the terminal. Implementing 3D Touch on this display means a more complicated manufacturing process that has a direct impact on price. By the way, contrary to the initial rumours, the screen will not be curved but will remain flat and with a 2.5D crystal like the current iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus.  A revolutionary front camera According to renowned analyst KGI Securities Ming-chi Kuo, the iPhone 8 will feature a front camera that will be revolutionary. And among other things, it will incorporate a 3D sensor that will work in conjunction with 2D images that are taken in photographs to create unique selfies. Sounds interesting, but we still can not get an idea. The sensors used in the new camera will allow a series of complex calculations using dedicated infrared transmitters and emitters from Sony. According to the popular Japanese company, the IR signals are emitted abroad and when they bounce against objects, they return to the terminal and are picked up by a 1.4MP receiver. In addition to this technology will be able to implement facial recognition, an idea that Apple is considering as the future replacement of the current TouchID for tasks such as unlocking the device, generalised payments through the App Store and iTunes Store and the use of Apple Pay. With all this, Apple would leave behind the dual camera system that has given so good results with the iPhone 7 Plus and will address Android algorithms in 3D cameras.  Wireless charge The wireless charging is one of the most anticipated by users of iPhone specifications as well as a battery with greater autonomy, something achieved through the SLP technology. To carry it out, Apple has addressed a redesign of the terminal in terms of materials and bands. Thus, the iPhone 8 will have a glass body and will use the inductive load, so that the charge will be produced by touching the charging base – exactly the same as the Apple Watch – and not remote as initially speculated. One more thing … Also, although the processor that will be integrated is not known, obviously we can count on it to be more powerful and faster than the A10 that uses the current iPhone 7 and the A10X of the new iPad Pro 2. As for other specifications, we will know that it will run With iOS 11 with 3 GB of RAM – which in the Apple environment is going to be brutal – and with a storage space of 256 GB. They have been speculated with another series of specifications such as the Touch Bar or the use of augmented reality, that although they are feasible in the medium term and that would undoubtedly raise the cost substantially, nevertheless we believe that they will not be implemented in the iPhone 8 Which will be launched in six months. The concepts and videos we have seen so far have been spectacular and we believe that reality will outperform fiction and Apple will mark a before and after in the market.

Home Apple News Apple Rumors iPhone iPad iPod Mac Apple TV Apple Watch About Apple News Apple Rumors Share on Facebook The iPhone could be banned in the USA The legal battle between Qualcomm and Apple seems to have no end, in fact, every day that passes seems to grow. The latest news is that the maker of chips and modems plans a strategy that would ban iPhone entry to the United States, according to Bloomberg. And is that Qualcomm has not been at all good that Apple fails to pay the corresponding fees and is ready to counterattack. Qualcomm prepares a petition to the International Trade Commission to prevent the iPhone, which we recall is made in Asia, enter the country. Can you imagine the prohibition of Apple’s flagship product in the territory where it most sells and in which it also has its headquarters? This lock would arrive in autumn, just in time for the launch of the iPhone 10th anniversary edition, also known as iPhone 8, iPhone Edition, iPhone X or simply iPhone. Qualcomm and Apple have a legal dispute in progress since last January that began when the FTC complained about Qualcomm for alleged anti-competitive practices in patents. Shortly after, Apple sued Qualcomm, accusing it of charging it with abusive royalties for “technologies that have nothing to do” and therefore, refusing to pay their respective quarterly fees. In April, Qualcomm counter-attacked Apple for defaulting on licensing agreements, making false statements and encouraging investigations and attacks on Qualcomm’s business in several countries. Qualcomm notes that without them, Apple could never have built its incredible emporium around the iPhone. A few weeks ago the demand heated when Apple stopped paying royalties, further reaffirming that it would not do so again until a court determined the amount owed. Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO himself, reaffirmed two days ago in his interview with US television, asserting that they would not open the wallet until the court decided simply because Qualcomm refuses to license its patents on FRAND terms, Reasonable and Non-Discriminatory, ie fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory. And is that for the Cupertino is as easy as you can not pay something when it is not known exactly how much has to be paid. It seems that Qualcomm would be trying to charge a percentage of the value of the iPhone, but its patented technologies in modems are only a small part of the iPhone itself and are not the key to success of the smartphone. But of course, the last one of Qualcomm is simply brutal. How are they going to get the iPhone banned from entering the United States? In reality, this blockade could occur if the International Trade Commission puts aside Qualcomm, in addition to what we think, since it acts more quickly than ordinary justice, which would take years to do, but it is hard to imagine that This measure materialises.

The iMac is very capable, yet the tech giant is promising an even more high-performance system. So what can we expect on the upcoming variant? What Apple Has Confirmed So Far Last month, Apple Insider reported that the Cupertino-based company confirmed its development of new iMacs that include a variant catering to professional consumers. Now, that’s not to say that the current lineup is not capable of heavy duty tasks. In fact, even Craig Federighi, Apple senior vice president of Software Engineering, acknowledged the capabilities of the current iMac. “And now you look at today’s 5K iMac, top configs, it’s incredibly powerful, and a huge fraction of what would’ve traditionally – whether it’s audio editing, video editing, graphics, arts, and so forth – that would’ve previously absolutely required the Mac Pros of old, are being well addressed by iMac.” Even so, Apple believes that it could take the iMac further, leading to the rumored iMac Pro version. This variant will have higher specifications, which will specifically target pro consumers. 2017 iMac Pro Specs We Can Expect Although Apple has yet to reveal the exact configuration of the iMac Pro, leaks already give us an idea of how powerful it could be. According to data obtained by DigiTimes, the high-specced, all-in-one desktop will come with a server-grade Xeon E3-1285 v6 processor, which is yet to be released by Intel. The chip will be paired with 16GB to 64GB ECC RAM and the iMac Pro will come with a 2TB NVMe SSD and a latest graphics card, which is unidentified for now. So far, this configuration is looking great. We expect no less from a Pro variant of a highly capable computer. [Image by Apple] The publication also learned that there are two variants in the works: a 21.5-inch and a 27-inch iMac. Both will likely feature the same specs and options. 2017 iMac Pro Release Date Confirmed For This Year We don’t know exactly when the new lineup will be revealed, but we’ve learned from these two reports that the iMac Pro is certainly launching later this year. The reveal is reportedly being planned for the third quarter of 2017 so that it will be widely available once the holiday season comes around. That puts the possible unveiling event to be anytime in July to September, contrary to a popular rumor that states it is coming out in October. This rumor mainly comes from the fact that the new MacBook Pro with the Touch Bar – and other products – were introduced that month last year. Another rumor states that the iMac Pro could be unveiled during the Worldwide Developers Conference coming this June, though that’s highly unlikely. First of all, Apple is eyeing the second half of 2017 and second, rarely a hardware ever appears at the said event. Other Exciting Features To Expect While we know that the 2017 iMac Pro will indeed be a powerhouse we haven’t seen before in Apple history, we are still in the dark regarding its features. In a previous report by Inquisitr though, it is believed to be coming with an upgraded keyboard with adaptive input. [Image by Stephen Lam/Getty Images] What this means, we don’t really know. But the patent for such a keyboard implies that it will be highly similar to the Touch Bar feature of the MacBook Pro 2016. But this contradicts what Apple’s Phil Schiller said in a report by Buzzfeed. According to him, pro consumers aren’t that much interested in talking about touch, which eliminates the possibility of a touchscreen monitor and maybe the Touch Bar. The 2017 iMac Pro specs are looking spectacular, but Apple has yet to confirm these. Stay tuned for more updates, we’ll know more in the coming months.

Amazon has been competing fiercely with the likes of Apple and Google in the video streaming space. It’s even gotten to the point where Amazon doesn’t have its Prime Video service on Apple TV or most Android TV devices and Apple TVs and Chromecasts aren’t even sold on their site. But it looks like Amazon and Apple have at least reached an agreement when it comes to Amazon Prime Video’s availability on Apple TV. It’s presumed that Amazon will be creating an app for Apple TV and even a mobile Prime Video app for iOS. The app is rumoured to be coming out this summer. Let’s hope this is true.

By New York Times | Updated: May 06, 2017, 01.55 PM IST Post a Comment By Jeff Sommer Great things are expected of the most valuable company on the planet. Apple, which has a world-beating market capitalization of $776 billion, is still meeting those expectations, but barely. And that could cause headaches down the road for investors and for the stock market as a whole. Apple shares, among the most widely held in the world, hit a record Friday, yet the company’s sales have been so-so and no new game-changing gadgets other than a revamped iPhone are in sight. “Apple has ushered itself squarely into a new normal of pedestrian growth,” Edison Investment Research said, summing up the market reaction to Apple’s latest quarterly earnings report on Tuesday. In a nutshell, after a stumble last year, Apple started to grow again late in the year and continued to do so in the first three months of this year, but not by much. Revenue in the first quarter was 5 percent higher than over the same period a year earlier — a respectable but hardly eye-popping performance, and one that won’t restore Apple’s old reputation as a paradigmatic “growth company.” Yet Apple’s stock rose last week, after increasing more than 28 percent this year. The company generates profits on a barely conceivable scale. So what’s the problem? It is simply that Apple’s standing in the stock market has largely been built on that aging little object, the iPhone. A major iPhone rejuvenation is expected in September, the 10th anniversary of its birth. That is likely to spur greater sales, for a while at least. But how long can the iPhone wield its financial magic, and will the company come up with another invention with awesome monetary powers? It may seem unfair to quibble this way, given Apple’s technological accomplishments and financial position. The company makes useful and reliable, if expensive, products. I’m typing on a Mac, have an iPhone in my pocket and an iPad tucked away in my backpack, and all have served me well. The Apple Watch has its aficionados, though I’m not one of them. But whatever your relationship with Apple devices, the company has not come up with a technological game changer in years. That hasn’t prevented its share price from powering upward. For the moment, the stock market remains entranced with what Apple is doing financially, and for understandable reasons. Apple may no longer be a great growth company but it is still extraordinary, said Aswath Damodaran, a New York University finance professor, who has analyzed Apple’s earnings closely since 2010. Come what may, he said, Apple churns out staggering quantities of money with metronomic regularity. “Apple is the greatest corporate cash machine in history,” he said in an interview. “We should appreciate that amazing achievement. The problem is, it’s not growing much. It’s a slow-growth cash-generating machine.” On Tuesday, the company provided fresh details of how great a cash machine it is. In just three months, after expenses and investments and payouts to shareholders, Apple’s colossal pile of cash and marketable securities grew another $10.8 billion, reaching a nearly unfathomable $256.8 billion. In the scheme of things, how big is that? Consider that $256.8 billion is more than the value of every other U.S. company except Microsoft, Alphabet, Facebook, Exxon Mobil, Johnson & Johnson, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. Apple has enough cash for an outright purchase of General Electric or Wells Fargo or AT&T, the data shows. There is speculation that Apple will make a major acquisition: Companies like Netflix, Disney, Hulu and Tesla are on analysts’ lists. But there is little sign right now that Apple intends to dispose of its money that way, in a gigantic acquisition. Instead, the company announced Tuesday that it would expand its program of returning cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock buybacks. The numbers here, too, are so immense that they are hard to grasp. In a conference call with stock analysts, Luca Maestri, Apple’s chief financial officer, said that since 2012, Apple’s buybacks and dividends amounted to $211.2 billion: The buybacks alone total $151 billion. Without those buybacks, which reduce Apple’s shares and total value, Apple’s market cap might already be as high as $900 billion (though without the buybacks, Apple’s stock price would be lower, so such calculations are inherently imprecise). Furthermore, in the next two years, Maestri said, the company intends “to return $89 billion to our investors, which represents about 12 percent of our market cap at the current stock price.” All of which is to say that if Apple’s cash machine keeps clicking, it could well become the first company with a $1 trillion market cap. But it would probably get there much faster if it were not sending so much cash back to investors. The fact that it is doing so is great for shareholders, Damodaran said. It is displaying commendable discipline, he said, because Apple has had no better use for the money, either internally or with a big acquisition of a less-profitable or money-losing company. Apple is already investing as much as it can in useful research and development, the company said Tuesday. “We know how much we need to invest in the business,” Maestri said in the conference call. “We will never underinvest in the business. We’re in a very fortunate position that we generate cash beyond the needs that we have.” Apple stashes nearly $240 billion of its cash offshore, out of reach of the IRS. Much of it will presumably return to the United States if the Trump administration lowers corporate tax rates, as it has proposed. Maestri said the company’s current plans for its cash reflect “the current tax legislation in this country, and there’s a lot that still needs to happen there, and we’ll see. Obviously, we will reassess our situation if things change.” Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst with Bernstein Research, said a favorable tax deal could add another $9 or so to Apple’s shares, which are trading at about $149. The expected redesign of the iPhone should also help the stock in the next several months, he said, because “we’ve found that Apple’s share price rises in the three to six months before the new phone comes out.” Apple stock is in that sweet spot now, he said. Like Damodaran, however, he remains skeptical about Apple’s longer-term growth prospects. “The company is so big that it takes a lot to move the needle for growth,” he said. Apple’s global base of iPhone users is growing ever larger, which implies rising income from music and apps and headphones and the like, and it’s even possible that the company will come up with a new Big Thing in technology. Even if it does not, he said, the share price is still attractive. Damodaran takes a more gimlet-eyed view. Back in February, when Apple shares were still trading at $130, he calculated Apple’s value based on metrics like cash flow and declared that the company was “fully deserving of its market value.” But when the stock price reached $140, he sold his own shares. “It’s still a great company,” he said in an interview. “But I don’t like the price.” It isn’t a crazy price, not if you expect that Apple will remain disciplined and highly profitable and, maybe, even have another growth spurt next year. But unless the old Apple magic returns, the company right now is not a bargain. Comments(0)Add Comments Can the Apple cash machine keep chugging?

By: Reuters | Bengaluru | Updated: May 6, 2017 2:10 pm The other potential acquisition targets include video game developers Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts and video streaming service Hulu. (Image for representation, Source: Reuters) Citigroup listed seven companies as potential takeover targets for Apple Inc, including Netflix, Walt Disney and Tesla Inc, as a way to put its cash hoard of more than $250 billion to work. With over 90 percent of its cash sitting overseas, a one-time 10 percent repatriation tax would give Apple $220 billion for acquisitions or buybacks, Citigroup analyst Jim Suva said in a note to clients. US President Donald Trump’s tax blueprint, which was unveiled last month, proposes allowing multinationals to bring in overseas profits at a tax rate of 10 percent versus 35 percent now. “Since one of the new administration’s top priorities is to allow US companies to repatriate overseas cash at a lower tax rate, Apple may have a more acute need to put this cash to use,” Suva said. The analyst is rated three out of five stars for his recommendations on Apple, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine.The other potential acquisition targets include video game developers Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts and Take Two Interactive Software as well as video streaming service Hulu. Also Read: Apple jumps to lead wearable computing with smartwatch, says survey The analyst said the targets were screened considering five criteria – strategic fit, global scale, transaction size, few non-strategic assets and likely impact on Apple’s share price.Under pressure from shareholders to hand over more of its cash hoard, Apple recently boosted its capital return program by $50 billion, increased its share buyback program by $35 billion and raised its quarterly dividend by 10.5 percent.

Digital Trends Home > Wearables > Move over Fitbit, Apple is now the king of the… Move over Fitbit, Apple is now the king of the wearables market By Lulu Chang — May 5, 2017 1:21 PM Subscribe Share Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you Apple unseated Fitbit as the reigning power of the wearables market, which hopefully leads to some competitive deals to entice potential buyers. Apple just keeps annexing more territory. Its latest conquest? The wearables industry. Per Strategy Analytics‘ latest report on the state of the global wearables market, Apple has asserted its dominance as far as market share is concerned and is now at the top of the heap thanks to its Apple Watch. This marks the first time Apple has unseated Fitbit for the crown, and there has been quite a shakeup throughout the ranks of the wearable makers. Xiaomi took second place in the first quarter of 2017 behind Apple, pushing Fitbit to a rather distant third place. However, it looks as though customers around the world are more enamored than ever with these wearable devices, as overall sales have increased by nearly 4 million units. So what is behind Apple’s recent success? According to Strategy Analytics Executive Director Neil Mawston, it’s all about the Series 2. “The new Apple Watch Series 2 is selling relatively well in the U.S., UK, and elsewhere due to enhanced styling, intensive marketing and a good retail presence,” he said. As Mashable noted, other experts noted that the new Apple Watch’s emphasis on health and fitness features have endeared the wearable further to customers. Fitbit, on the other hand, has not enjoyed the same growth. As Cliff Raskind, Director at Strategy Analytics, said, “Fitbit shipped 2.9 million wearables worldwide in Q1 2017, falling a huge 36 percent annually from 4.5 million in Q1 2016. Fitbit has lost its wearables leadership to Apple, due to slowing demand for its fitness bands and a late entry to the emerging smartwatch market. Fitbit’s shipments, revenue, pricing and profit are all shrinking at the moment and the company has a major fight on its hands to recover this year.” Regardless, given the global appetite for wearables, it seems as though Fitbit (along with Apple and Xiaomi) have plenty of room to grow. “Global wearables shipments reached 22.0 million units in Q1 2017, rising 21 percent annually from 18.2 million in Q1 2016,” commented Steven Waltzer, Industry Analyst at Strategy Analytics. “Stronger demand for new smartwatch models in North America, Western Europe, and Asia drove the uptick.”

Now, as the Oracle of Omaha prepares to kick off this year's Berkshire shareholder convention on Saturday, the opposite is true: The vast majority of the stocks Warren Buffett owns have made money over the past year, helping his portfolio gain some $16 billion dollars in value. Fortune crunched the numbers through the market close Friday, the day before the meeting, adjusting for stocks Buffett has bought and sold in the meantime. The analysis found that of the 43 companies Berkshire Hathaway (brk.a) currently owns, all but seven have risen—and the winners are up much more than the losers are down. Buffett fans will get a chance to hear him discuss his stocks and their performance on Saturday, even if they're not in Omaha, by tuning in to the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting live stream starting at 10 a.m. ET. Here's a brief report card on Buffett's best—and worst—stock picks this year. Winners In a sign of Buffett's investing prescience, a stock that no one expected him to buy has lately turned out to be his most successful bet: Apple (aapl). It won't surprise market watchers to know that Apple stock is the top performer in Buffett's portfolio since the last Berkshire meeting, up about 59%. Apple, after all, was also the biggest winner in the Dow Jones industrial average in Donald Trump's first 100 days as president. Related Warren BuffettWarren Buffett Says Berkshire Hathaway Stock May Start Paying Dividends Warren Buffett Warren Buffett Says Berkshire Hathaway Stock May Start Paying Dividends Buffett, who for much of his career avoided tech stocks, has capitalized on that rally by doubling—or, if you will, sextupling—down on Apple stock: He owns six times as much of it now as he did at this time last year, making him one of the iPhone maker's largest shareholders. That stake has gained nearly $2 billion in value this year alone. Perhaps more surprising is Buffett's second-best pick over the past year, as it has recently been known more for controversy than outperformance: United Airlines stock, up almost 44% since the investor bought it in the third quarter of 2016. The travel company United Continental Holdings (ual) came under fire last month when a passenger was dragged off one of its overbooked flights, a fiasco that dragged as much as $90 million off the value of Buffett's stake as United stock plummeted amid the ensuing outrage. The shares have since recovered, but Buffett may still field questions about the customer service debacle during Berkshire's meeting Saturday. On the heels of United Airlines were Berkshire's holdings Charter Communications (chtr), which has risen nearly 43% since last year's meeting, and Goldman Sachs (gs), whose shares are up 38%. In dollar terms, though, a few of Buffett's picks with more modest returns were actually the most lucrative for the investor's portfolio this past year, in large part because Berkshire Hathaway owns massive quantities of their shares. For example, Berkshire's biggest holding, Kraft Heinz (khc), rose less than 15%—underperforming the S&P 500, which is up more than 16% since Berkshire's last annual meeting. But Buffett's $29 billion stake in the macaroni and ketchup conglomerate is now worth about $3.8 billion more now than it was then. And Wells Fargo (wfc), still dealing with the fallout of its fake accounts scandal, is up just 10%, but Buffett's position has gained almost $2.5 billion in value over that time. (Expect the stock picker to discuss the bank's problems with its sales practices at the annual meeting.) Lastly, Buffett's major bet on American Express (axp) contributed more to his returns than Apple, even though the credit card company's shares are up a relatively modest 20% since last year's meeting. Berkshire's Amex stock has added nearly $2 billion in value in that period. Losers The worst performer in Buffett's portfolio was DaVita (dva), the health care dialysis company that treats patients with diabetes and whose stock has been punished by uncertainty over the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare. DaVita stock has fallen more than 11% since last year's Berkshire Hathaway meeting. Some of Buffett's telecom holdings were the next biggest losers, with Liberty Global (lbtya) down 9% and Verizon (vz) stock down more than 8%. The cable companies are dealing with fierce competition as well as consolidation that has added volatility to the industry. But Buffett may have escaped the worst of the damage, as he sold nearly all of his Verizon stock over the past year, and owned just a tiny $43,000 stake as of Berkshire Hathaway's latest holdings disclosure. The other Berkshire stocks that dropped since last year's meeting include General Electric (ge), down 5%; Twenty-First Century Fox (fox), down nearly 4%; Phillips 66 (psx), down 3%; and Coca-Cola (ko), down a little more than 2%. Buffett also announced this week that he sold a third of his shares in his longtime holding IBM (ibm). While IBM stock has risen over the past 12 month, up 6%, Buffett may have gotten fed up with its more recent performance, as the shares are down almost 7% so far in 2017. Stocks that Buffett has dumped completely since Berkshire Hathaway's last annual meeting include Deere (de), Kinder Morgan (kmi), Lee Enterprises (lee), Now Inc. (dnow.wi) and Suncor (su). (He no longer owns Media General, either, because that company was acquired by Nexstar earlier this year.) Ironically, despite the many Buffett holdings that have beat the market by a long shot over the past year, Berkshire Hathaway stock itself has underperformed. (In addition to its stock holdings, Berkshire owns a large, diverse portfolio of companies outright.) Berkshire's shares have risen just more than 14%, lagging behind the S&P 500. Buffett and his shareholders likely won't worry too much about this short-term blip: Berkshire Hathaway stock returned roughly twice as much as the S&P 500 in calendar year 2016.

Worldwide tablet shipments have declined 8.5% over the past year, Q1 is the tenth straight quarter in decline Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/04 1:20pm PDTMay 4, 2017 68 Plus 1 on G+ 41 Share on Facebook 110 Share on Twitter Total Shares219 News Remember when everyone thought tablets would replace PCs, at least for average consumers? Yeah, that didn't happen. In fact, the opposite is happening. In a report from the International Data Corporation (IDC), worldwide tablet shipments in Q1 2017 have dropped 8.5% compared to Q1 2016, with just 36.2 million devices shipped. In addition, Q1 2017 is the tenth straight quarter where the tablet market saw a decline, with the previous five quarters recording double-digit drops. It's worth noting that the IDC only counts 'slates' (tablets lacking a keyboard) and 'detachables' (tablets with first-party keyboards) as tablets. There are a few reasons for this continuing decline, which shouldn't be surprising to anyone. Convertible laptops, commonly referred to as 2-in-1s, have been cannibalizing the tablet market for a while now. The rise of larger smartphones didn't help tablets either. Apple remained top dog over the past quarter, with 8.9 million unit shipments. Samsung followed in second place, with Huawei, Amazon, and Lenovo rounding out the top five manufacturers. Apple's results likely had a small bump from the recent 9.7" iPad refresh. Samsung also released the Galaxy Tab S3 during this time, but it launched near the end of Q1, so the impact is likely negligible. Again, this shouldn't be surprising to anyone. There has been very little incentive for people with tablets to buy new ones, and Android tablets haven't seen much attention from OEMs or Google since the Honeycomb days. Press Release FRAMINGHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The worldwide tablet market once again contracted in the first quarter of 2017 (1Q17) with total shipments of 36.2 million, a year-over-year decline of 8.5%, according to preliminary data from the International Data Corporation (IDC) Worldwide Quarterly Tablet Tracker. The first quarter contraction marks the tenth straight quarter that tablets have experienced a decline over the same quarter a year earlier, with the previous five quarters recording double-digit drops. The tablet market is comprised of two different product categories, which are headed in very different directions as noted by IDC in the past. Devices offering a first-party keyboard, which IDC refers to as detachable tablets, continue to grow for the most part. Many of these devices have quickly grown to resemble products that IDC refers to as traditional notebook PCs or laptops. The other product category is slate tablets (those lacking this keyboard option), which saw shipments peak in 2014 and is now in a steep decline that IDC believes will continue throughout the forecast period. "As far as most are aware, the tablet market was created in 2010 with the launch of the original iPad, despite unsuccessful product attempts by other OEMs in the years leading up to this," said Ryan Reith, program vice president with IDC's Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Device Trackers. "The rate at which the tablet market grew from 2010 to 2013 was unlike many other consumer-oriented device markets we've seen before. However, it appears for many reasons consumers became less eager to refresh these devices, or in some instances purchase them at all. We continue to believe the leading driver for this was the increased dependency on smartphones, along with rather minimal technology and form factor progression." At the same time that this roller coaster of tablet growth, peak, and decline was taking place, the personal computer market was experiencing one the worst declines the market's history. Fast forward to 1Q17 and traditional PCs have returned to growth, albeit relatively flat growth, for the first time since 1Q12. "A long-term threat to the overall PC market lies in how the market ultimately settles on the detachable versus convertible debate," said Linn Huang, research director, Devices & Displays at IDC. "To date, detachable shipments have dwarfed those of convertibles, but growth of the former has slowed a bit. In IDC's 2017 U.S. Consumer PCD Survey, fielded over the previous two months, detachable owners held slightly more favorable attitudes towards their detachables than convertible owners did for their convertibles. However, owners of both were far more likely to recommend a convertible over a detachable." IDC's outlook is that detachables will continue to far outpace convertibles in shipments, but the market pendulum seems to be swinging back in favor of convertibles if ever so slightly. Still, the detachable market has proven it will move with major product launches and Microsoft and Apple have yet to launch their 2017 salvos. Tablet Company Highlights Apple experienced its 13th consecutive quarter of year-over-year shipment decline despite being the market leader in 1Q17. Apple's results show that it is not immune to the changing dynamics of industry and consumer demand, part of which is due to the ongoing success of its other product lines. 2016 was Apple's first full year of iPad Pro shipments, which included the launch of the smaller screen lower-cost 9.7 inch version. This product line quickly elevated Apple to the top of the growing detachable tablet market segment, and IDC believes Apple is in a good spot to remain competitive at the top of this segment despite using a 'mobile OS' while many of its competitors are entering the space with Windows-based devices. Samsung remained the number 2 tablet provider despite seeing shipments decline 1.1% year over year in 1Q17. Much like Apple, Samsung continues to migrate its tablet portfolio to the detachable segment and to support this the company launched three new products at this year's Mobile World Congress event in Barcelona in February. After supposedly leaving the PC business in 2014, Samsung now finds itself approaching the market again with a handful of Windows 10 detachable tablet models. The move isn't surprising as the entire industry seems keen on taking advantage of this market opportunity. Huawei was the only company among the top 5 to experience positive growth in 1Q17 with shipments of 2.7 million, which was up 31.7% from the 2.0 million shipped in the first quarter a year ago. Like Samsung, Huawei has also slowly migrated its tablet portfolio from an Android slate tablet lineup to now include a mix of Windows-based detachable devices. It is somewhat unclear how serious Huawei is about going down the Windows device route, but given this quarter's growth while others decline it seems the mix strategy and tablet play is working for the company. Amazon.com continues to fluctuate in and out of the top rankings with its low-cost Kindle Fire devices. In 1Q17 the company shipped 2.2 million devices, all of which continue to be aimed at a very aggressive price point with a strategy to drive content and product sales via the device. Regardless of the changing industry dynamics mentioned in this release, Amazon seems poised to remain a competitor given its market strategy. Lenovo rounded out the top 5 with 2.1 million tablets shipped in the quarter. Of all the companies in the top 5, Lenovo is likely best positioned in terms of channel strategy to grow its tablet business and IDC expects to see more of its successful notebook PC lineup migrate into the detachable tablet category. Lenovo captured 5.7% market share in 1Q17, which was down just slightly from the 5.5% market share it had at this time last year. Notes: Total tablet market includes slate tablets plus detachable tablets. References to "tablets" in this release include both slate tablets and detachable devices. The reference to 'convertibles' for convertible notebooks, which are notebook PCs that have keyboards that can either flip, spin, or twist, but unlike detachable tablets, convertible notebook keyboards are hardwired to the display.

My Nexus 7 has been in a drawer since I got my Nexus 6 and Nexus 6P. Geoff Johnson Plus ultrabooks have been getting smaller, lighter, and cheaper, so it's not as much of a pain to carry around a laptop like it was 5 years ago. Suicide_Note Agreed. Buying the N6 made my second gen N7 pretty much irrelevant/redundant, so i sold it and never bought another tablet after that. Timmy Turner Same, although I still whip it out for road trips for movies. Dan Nah, I bought a used N9 on swappa to go with my N6, I read books and e-mail and such on the N6, but the larger screen is much better for web surfing, shopping etc. Callanish My Nexus 7 LTE continues to get decent use as it splits the battery load with my 6P so I don't need to charge the phone throughout the day. It is getting long in the tooth though as far as performance though. Keeping a close eye on Lenovo's new tablets coming out in May, especially the 8 inch tab 4 plus LTE model which should make for a decent replacement to the Nexus 7 2013. Thade780 When I got my Nexus 6 I thought the same, but then I started craving a bigger screen for when I was at home and just wanted to browse Reddit and watch Youtube. In the end I got a 10" Samsung S2 and I'm in fucking love with it. It's still plenty fast and does everything I need, so I'm going to skip the S3. I may end up with a possible Tab S4 next year. Master Yates I disagree as my Galaxy Tab S2 is much nicer for surfing the net than my One Plus 3 when I'm at home. As soon as One Plus makes a tablet, I'll be all over it. sbeaulieu My Nexus 9 is working so great it make me want to buy another one. /s & /s Peter Silie I'm fine with my N9 :) (/nosarcasm) wjrandon Burn the Nexus 9 with fire. freddyba I have a Samsung Galaxy Tab S 10.5", and it works great. However I won't buy another Galaxy Tab S(X) until they get a 16:9 screen again. I will just stick with what I have, replace the battery in a few years if need be. However I will gladly take suggestions on 16:9 tablets if any one has them! Marty They say the iPad is also in decline. I find that difficult to believe because I own a number of iPads and find them to be the finest web browsing tool ever created. I use mine for media playing, web browsing and a few other task-related things. I came from a PC, which is all I cared to use for web browsing and everything else. But since owning an iPad, the PC now seems clunky at best. I hate to even boot my PCs up. I relegate them strictly to command line tasks. They just don't provide the ease and simplicity of usage I experience with my iPads. I also own Android tablets. There has never been an Android tablet in my experience that has been worth a damn for reliable web browsing or other usage. In my opinion they are the absolute worst devices yet. So, given the value I deem of the iPad trying to understand why it's not selling like gangbusters, I just wonder if people aren't buying Android tablets, getting the same horrifically crappy experience I have with them and then condemning all tablets as worthless...the iPad included? I just wonder if people are being terminally pessimistic about *all* tablets because of any experience with Android tablets? I can understand that if that's happening. I've tended to be that way with things at times myself. catalysto I can't speak to the decline of the iPad, but I absolutely hate any tablet browsing experience. Mobile web browsing is painfully limited in many cases, and for that reason alone, I cannot get into the idea of replacing my laptop with a tablet. I'd get a Chromebook before getting a tablet (though in an ideal situation, I'd have a nice, convertible ultrabook). Marty I've done pretty much ever configuration of PC. I started out buying an eMachines tower a very long time ago. Then I bought a Velocity Micro tower rig. Then I started building my own custom tower rigs. Built several and even sold one on eBay trying to go into the custom PC business. Didn't work out due to family-related issues. Then I got into laptops and have owned a handful. Now I'm into tablet PCs. I own two: a Sony 11.6" Vaio Tap 11 and a Surface 3. None of them have been as convenient to use as my iPads. I doubt I will ever buy another PC...unless MS can somehow radically improve Windows to where it's as convenient and easy to use as an iPad. Not likely, though. catalysto Yeah, but none of that addresses the software limitations of a mobile browser. I understand that it's important to find a good device, but I think that can already be found in several existing ultrabook and convertible devices. But of course, if you are fine with the mobile browsing experience, that's totally fine, too. iPads are definitely great for that! Marty The hardware... generally... isn't the problem with PCs, it's the software and browsers that presents the biggest convenience blockage. Microsoft's Edge browser is about the best you can get for user convenience, but it oales in comparison to Safari on the iPad. I was a big Firefox fan for PC browsing, and on powerful enough equipment it's really good. But on a Surface 3, it sucks. So it all depends on the configuration of a PC to get the best out of it. I agree, the capability of mobile browsers can't match a PC experience. But for general web browsing usage, the iPad can't be beat. catalysto I have to disagree. Chrome is great, and it has given me the best browsing experience by far -- especially because of its speed and cross-device syncing. And again, I loathe any sort of mobile browser, so pretty much any desktop browser would be preferable to me. But this is obviously very subjective, so I guess we'll have to agree to disagree. I mean, it's great that you are so satisfied with the iPad, but making general statements like "can't be beat" is inherently incorrect because of different people's preferences. By the way, I only mentioned hardware because you brought it up when describing all the different machines you've tried. Marty It's not incorrect. People that haven't used an iPad for web surfing are basing their assertions on the Android experience. Yes, mobile browsing on any Android sucks bad...at least used to till Samsung Internet Beta came along. But I have used Chrome on all systems and the bookmarks system on mobile Chrome makes it entirely miserable for people who are used to a desktop browsing experience. Safari alleviates much of the misery by providing a near-desktop experience, but without a mouse. catalysto It is indeed incorrect because it's based on a subjective evaluation. There's no "right answer". We have several iOS devices in our home, so I've used iPads and iPhones extensively. Regardless, I hate any mobile browsing experience -- on iPad or otherwise. Mobile means any mobile browser on any OS. Though I will say that I much prefer Chrome on Android to Safari on iOS, so, again, subjective. And I find the Chrome bookmarks work great, so I don't know what you're talking about there either. The bookmark and tab syncing is another of my favorite features, actually. Marty You keep expounding on Chrome's syncing capabilities. I'm talking about actual usage. If I have to press a menu button and then press another button to find my bookmarks, IT IS NOT A DESKTOP BROWSER EXPERIENCE. You absolutely have immediate access to bookmarks on a desktop browser. You absolutely have immediate access to bookmarks in mobile Safari. You do not have immediate access to bookmarks on mobile Chrome. And you CANNOT use desktop chrome on Android. Jeeeze! How the hell are people so blind and so deft??? catalysto I'm not expounding on anything; I'm just mentioning a feature I really like about Chrome and one of the reasons I prefer it over other browsers. In any case, I see this conversation is going nowhere. So as I suggested earlier, we'll just have to agree to disagree. =) Marty Yeah, whatever. Thankfully there's now a much better alternative on Android. No need to put up with Google's ignorance or laziness. Marty Here's what I hear people like you say...people who seem to f*cking love the bookmarks in mobile Chrome: "I have to press a billion buttons to get to bookmarks in mobile Chrome, but they're there. What's wrong?" Nexus Hexus I find using my Acer X34 Monitor, Core i7 7700k @5Ghz, GTX 1070, 32GB Ram, 960 EVO SSD to be worlds better then any iPad. You're one of those people that say your new phone or tablet is better to use then his 10 year old budget computer. Marty To each, his own. Brandon V. Fletcher iPad sales have been going down for a while. https://www.recode.net/2017/1/31/14460952/apple-ipad-sales-still-falling mxwp it's none of those reasons. it is because people with ipads don't buy new ipads every year, unlike with their iphones. everyone that wants one pretty much already has one. Marty To a certain extent, that's probably true. I know for myself that if my 16GB iPad Air 2 hadn't kept running out of space whenever I tried to install a few free apps BGR's daily listing, I would have kept using it and never would have bought a new one with more storage. But what you're saying assumes everyone already owns an iPad. Not likely. I run into people all the time online and in person who don't own one. So I believe there's a huge marketing potential if Apple can figure out how to sell the iPad properly. JLV90 Well most people use tablets for media consumption you don't need much performance to run netflix and youtube. RiftSilver I'm wondering if I'm just not looking, or uniformed. But what happened to good budget friendly tablets like the Nexus 7 (2013)? I love mine, still going strong. I know myself and others I know are in the market for a new good tablet, but for what most good tablets are going for now, ~$600, I'd rather buy a laptop. Jonathan Litwinka They stopped being "good". You can get an okay tablet for between $150-$200 at Costco or Amazon, but the tech is still comparable to the Nexus 7 (2013). Master Yates Agreed. The Nexus 7 2013 was way ahead of its time and that why its lasted so long. I'm not an LCD fan but the screen on the Nexus 7 2013 remains awesome. Callanish Keep your eye on the Lenovo Tab 4 range being released in May. Good pricing, decent specs and running Nougat 7.1.1. Like you, my Nexus 7 13 has been a workhorse, but performance has become my biggest gripe, even after cleaning out the cache now and then. Defenestratus My Pixel C is basically a laptop. It works beautifully for what I use it for - web browsing, kindle-reading and minor productivity work. fgd135 I replaced my tablet with a Samsung Chromebook Plus and couldn't be happier. destinyhud planning on doing this but waiting more devices burkett375 Waiting on the Pro...the processor on the + has me worried. dizel123 There are basically 2 classes of tablets. The decent ones that are waaaayyyy overpriced and the cheap ones that are absolute garbage. And most of them have very little to no software support. If companies sold decent tablets for decent prices and guaranteed updates, maybe people would buy them. destinyhud this is why i think a chromebook pixel c2 would be the best of both world. pixel c was just $500 Mix Bought an 8 " $200 Samsung tab A for my 2 year old for Paw Patrol and what not and it's great, the Galaxy tab S3 is $799...like what the balls Samsung!? Who would ever pay that for a freaking tablet? Zap Rowsdower Someone who has somebody else paying for it, like a school or company or relative as a gift. I bought a no-name Android tablet a few months ago, with keyboard and case for US$39.00. I popped a 512MB sd card in it and it's in my workshop for playing music on bluetooth speakers, watching how-to videos, casting to a nearby TV, whatever ... and other than a crap screen resolution, it's fast and works great. $39.00! Nicholas Conrad You're forgetting about the Nexus 7 Leonardo Coleman I initiated freelancing over world wide web, participating in some fundamental assignments which mainly needed a personal computer and also having access to internet in addition to Now I am more delighted than ever... half a year have gone by since i begun this and additionally i had income total of $36k...

Nicholas Conrad Sure, but they're still going strong. Really, what are tablets good for besides media consumption, and the N7 does that fine still. Wish it had an SD card slot though. n_a_v i wish mine was still going strong. touch screen starting crap out about 3 years ago and only works intermittently now. Ethan Nelson-Moore In a root terminal run: sleep 5; echo ff > /proc/ektf_dbg Then set your tablet on a flat surface and don't touch it for 5 seconds. It will recalibrate the screen. mxwp that was stated in the article... people with tablets are not buying new ones Nicholas Conrad Sure, because all they're really great at is watching movies on planes, and a 4 year old one is as good at that as a new one. No compelling new features to drive the upgrade cycle. Kristian Ivanov And the Shield K1 (the actual successor to the Nexus 7 2013) shonangreg Yeah, I've been waiting for a couple of years to buy a replacement for my Nexus 7. Other than the NVidia Shield K1, nothing was decent. So, I finally got an iPad Pro 9.7 last year (discount coupon with a pocket WiFi device). I still want a replacement for the Nexus 7, but I'm reluctant to buy the Shield K1 now as it is at the end of its life (and still not heavily discounted, at least here in Japan). Nicholas Conrad Yeah, I didn't buy a K1 because I was convinced an X1 tablet was just around the corner, regret that now. Sorry to hear about your ipad: I had one once, it was terrible. Zap Rowsdower Why was owning your iPad a terrible experience? That would be helpful to know. Nicholas Conrad It was my only ever apple device. It started with an ordeal over signing into the darn thing to begin with because you have to have an apple id to sign in, and it can't create one for you, then itunes is a racket, you need a new $15 app for everything you want to do. The darn thing doesn't even have a file system, so you need to buy apps that can move files from where some apps can see them to where other apps can see them. Playing movies or music from my LAN was nearly impossible because apple wants you to buy all of your content from them, and it doesn't play well with anything not made by apple. But mostly it was just buggy. I had constant app crashes and resprings, kept losing work onenote data and had to chuck it in a drawer. I mean, isn't their whole thing that it "just works"? There wasn't one redeeming thing about it if you're not already entrenched in the ios ecosystem. You still can't even set gosh-darn default apps on ios for crying out loud.... shonangreg My iPad has become my favorite device. I use the iPad for all communications (all duplicated on my phone and most on my N7). It is only when I'm at my desk or walking that my PCs or my phone get their turn. Si vis pacem, para bellum To me it's not even that, it's the lack of choice between the very good ones (the "way overpriced" ones). I have a 2.5+ years old Tab S 10.5 LTE which I love and use a lot when at home and even use as a laptop replacement when I live part of the year abroad (I used to carry my Windows laptop with me, not anymore). I don't see any real alternatives to my Tab S (I may be interested in a Pixel C, now that with Nougat it has finally got MultiWindows, but it's not sold here in Italy) and I have not upgraded to a Tab S2 nor am I probably going to upgrade to the Tab S3 because the marginal improvements are simply not worth it. Actually, they almost feel like a downgrade since they have removed the IR blaster (which I DO use), they put smaller batteries, they went for the 4:3 aspect ratio (I much prefer 16:10) and the S3 has a glass back (I MUCH prefer the "rubbery" one of my Tab S! At least they didn't choose a F'ing metal back, which is the thing that I hate the most on handheld devices). Compelling new features (like an *integrated* S-Pen, I am a Note user from the original one and I miss it on my tablet!) or substantial improvements in specs/battery life are the only reasons who would motivate me to upgrade since I don't have any problems with my Tab S: while not exactly blazing fast it runs quite well (it's on stock, rooted Marshmallow) and still gives me 5+ hours of SOT. YaKillaCJ Exactly. Then theirs Windows 2in1s. Windows 10 is definitely the way to go for 10inch screens. Ah I see what Microsoft did there lol. UniBroW Except the new ipad at $329, it's lightening fast and loads web content like a champ. Couple that with ad blockers from the App Store and you have a great tablet that can't do most PC things but amazingly good once you get over the home screen PVL_93_RU Here's the problem though... it's an Apple device. If you were an avid user of something like the Nexus 7 - you'd have to make a big switch to a whole new platform. Meaning you need to get used to new software, to deal with certain missing features, as well as having to repurchase the entire library of your apps and games, which is a big investment on top of buying the iPad in the first place. Then there's cases, accessories, .. JSo Well if a company would make something worth buying it might change. Marty You mean if a company would make an *Android tablet* worth buying it might change. There are none. Brian Klippel We buy used nexus 9's in this house. With nexus gone, all of the new tablets on the market are way to expensive for what they offer. Pretty much only the pixel will get more than a year of updates and it's just too expensive to watch youtube and play candy crush on. I had one samsung tablet that I smashed with a hammer because it was such a POS. Master Yates Nexus 9's? I'm surprised people aren't paying you to take them away. Biff Wonsley Last fall I bought an Asus ZenPad 8.0 (Z380M.) Not especially impressive specs, but it's fine for the usual apps & reading books & only cost $130. And about a month ago it was updated with Nougat, which I didn't in my wildest dreams expect. I have a Nexus 6, but I can't imagine reading a book with it. So long as 8" or so tablets are available, I'll have one. What passes for a phablet these days isn't big enough. Jay There hasn't exactly been many new and/or good tablets to help with these statistics either. Marc Edwards "Apple remained top tog" I think you mean top dog there my friend. fijisiv are you sure he didn't mean "dop tog"? Mix Maybe he was asking us a question? "Apple remained, got pot?" illregal There have been no new tablet releases.. Cakefish No need to replace my iPad Air 2 yet, it's still a beast. And I'm sure it'll handle iOS 11 just fine. destinyhud i dont think my ipad air will handle ios 11. i might not update and later get a Chromebook detachable Taios I understand this. But I so so so want someone to release a replacement for my nexus 7 2013. destinyhud come on chromebook pixel c2 Dan The "problem" if you want to look at it as one, is that people that want one have one and don't need an upgrade. If it ain't broke why buy a new one? Same thing in the PC market, it's not a decline in number used or in the house, just in sold because there is nothing wrong with the current one. Iamsecond Exactly! It irritates me every time I see a 'tablets sales decline' article that no-one seems to mention this. Tablets are simple devices for simple use cases such as web browsing and media consumption and so most older tablets do the job just fine. shonangreg A lot of Nexus 7 owners have been waiting ... and wanting ... Other than the Shield K1, there has been nothing. I do watch Huawei with interest; seems too locked down, though. We were told long ago that the bottleneck in OS upgrades for our phones were the carriers. This isn't a problems for tablets, generally, yet their track record is maybe even worse than phones. Leonardo Baez to be fair there is also less tablet offers to the market. me me I have Nexus 7 2013, Google Pixel C, and a Toshiba Chromebook 2. The Chromebook I have repaired it twice due the flexible plastic screen, the Pixel C has a tough outer shell construction and survives drops, the N7 2013 is still going strong but I use wireless charging to extend its socket life and custom kernel with 90% max charge to extend battery life. I'd happily buy newer if they were better. Innovation in mobiles is far greater, there's more of a reason to upgrade more often than with tablets. [A]dri[A]n I absolutely LOVE my Samsung Galaxy Tab A 10.1 (2015) It's a pretty damn good tablet for $249 or whatever they're priced at now. The battery life is amazingly great and the performance is more than good enough. Lasts about 3 to 4 days with around 15 hours of SOT. Like someone stated before, I'm pretty sure sales are down because the need/want to buy a new tablet isn't as important or relevant as buying a new phone. Mix Snagged the 8" Tab A for $199 CAD and it's a wicked little tablet and you can get 4 of them for the price of a single Galaxy S3 tablet.....Like, why would someone even consider an $800 tablet? whispy_snippet And people wonder why Google won't take tablets seriously. AQ I bought my first tablet last month, isn't as fast or high resolution as my phone but it lasts long & keeps me from charging my phone as much. it was cheap, gsm unlocked, has 2GB ram & 16GB rom+microsd & still has stereo front facing speakers. I doubt I could find another tablet twice it's price having at least those things. ethd ZTE Trek 2 HD, by chance? I replaced my old Nexus 10 with one of those and I couldn't be happier. It's shocking how good cheap tablets have gotten. AQ Yup, though I got it for only $70 it retails for $150 from AT&T, which still isn't bad for all the features it has. I love that its GSM unlocked, no WiFi only limits when I really want to use something that requires internet when away from home. Also it's great for GPS (loud, big & bright). StopBeingOffendedDERP psshhh. Who needs a tablet when you have a Surface Book. Best of both worlds. Kamal Qara’in People are increasingly looking for lightwaight, portable devices that mirror the functionality of a traditional PC. And that's unfortunately where Android tablets fail; there's little to no 'Value add'; powerful, tablet-optimised apps are almost non-existent on the platform xyz Great. I never liked tablets. Only PCs and smartphones for me. I guess people who bought tablets are satisfied with 6-7" phablets. me me No. I own 10" and 7" tablets, and I like 10" tablets when I'm spending days moving, and like 7" tablet when flying. The issues is there's nothing new worthwhile in newer tablets to bother with the effort to upgrade. A mobile however is always having a compromise of features vs performance so mobiles are being refreshed. Tablets are not being refreshed. This is about technology innovation being slower in tablets than mobiles so tablets are being refreshed less often. Larger tablets are just expensive, and Chromebooks overlap. russjr08 I have a Nexus 7 2013 and an iPad Air 2 and I absolutely love my N7 but it's definitely starting to show it's age. And I'm just not that into iOS to really use my iPad a lot. I also have a Surface Pro 3, but it's waaaaaay too big to be the "tablet" that I casually use to read on. Great for doing something like Netflix or Hulu, but otherwise... I'm just kind of relying on my phone (currently N5X) for most of my stuff. Vay L My n7 2013 touch barely work and i had this problem for over a year now. Im waiting for Lenovo tab 4 10 plus to be released this month. it looks promising on paper Nathan J Remember the Apple Newton? Apple's failed tablet under CEO John Sculley before Steve Jobs' triumphant return? It utterly failed. And now the iPad is pretty much the only successful tablet. It's weird because the PADD on Star Trek: The Next Generation was so cool. It was basically a Nexus 7 or iPad Mini in size, but thinner, I believe. And let's face it, LCARS (the OS) is pretty, but it's also pretty lame. Too many buttons, it's not a real OS, it's just for show. Even forgiving that, the huge borders on the fixed content areas are ugly. What it could do, we can do with tablets now. Access any information — Google and Wikipedia. Access all art and media — streaming services, and Google. Control certain ship functions — Google/Apple Home. We have that tech now and it's just not as cool as they make it out to be. Also, does anyone remember where they kept PADDs? They don't have pockets. They don't have holsters for them. (They do have phaser and tricorder holsters, though.) I've never seen a stack of PADDs waiting to be picked up. I've seen people set them down and pick them back up, but I've never seen a bunch of them. They just kind of come and go. I think if you have an Android phone, there's no real need for a tablet. Either you have a large phone or a huge phone, and it's partway to tablet land anyway. I can see having a small or normal sized iPhone and an iPad or iPad Mini to go with it. But I have the normal sized iPhone, and I don't want an iPad. Here's where I want Android. On a larger device. That's where I want to spend time customizing. My wife has a 2013 Nexus 7, and it's a good device. I want one in 8" with modern specs and either a microSD card slot, or 64GB of storage. Or 128GB. Or let me hook my portable SSD up to it. But I'm really not a tablet guy. Just a gadget hound... TedPhillips as someone who's recently been rewatching TnG, there are stacks of padd's (of various sizing), and the 'vertical file divider' style for collections of padd's on the show. Sootie I own a nexus 7 an ipad air 2 (or whatever the latest ones are called) an old ipad and some other big tablet plus laptops desktops but 90% of the time everything but my phone (pixel xl) is flat plus my phone works perfectly fine for everything I do with it (which admittedly is basically just reddit and youtube) and is always charged Peter Silie And I can tell you why it's like this: because there are so few tablets you can actually buy unless you want to spend a premium amount of money. There used to be way more choices, especially in the Android tablet market. Funem Android tablet specs have dropped while phone specs have increased. If I go online or to the shops its difficult to find a branded Android device that even has 32gb of memory, sometimes its even hard to find one with 16gb whilst phones have more and more crammed into them tablets just seem to have stagnated. The last tablet I purchased was the Tab Pro 12" which was a great tablet, but them Samsung didn't even upgrade the OS much and kind of just left it and this wasn't a cheap device. I'm still looking for a decent replacement with a 10" plus screen, 32gb of ram, SD card support and a decent screen resolution as I want to read my magazines on it and watch films and play some of the games that require a bigger screen real estate to work properly. The only one that came close recently was the Shield K1 Tablet, but the screen is to small. tinabolina2017 They aren't giving people what they want.the chips in then are too slow and the LTE is too expensive royrov Well, if Google just could sell their Pixel hardware here on Norway, I would have bought one a long time ago.. Richard Markert The verdict is in: nobody really wants tablets. Lord Argyris I'll just echo a lot of what has already been said here and in the article: the tablet product category as a whole has been cannibalized by other devices. Even traditional laptops have started to make inroads. Recently I narrowed down my choice for a new computer to a Surface Pro 4 or a 13-inch MBP and went with the latter. It's small and light enough that I don't miss the additional portability of the Surface or a new tablet. Part of my intention with the new purchase was to largely replace multiple devices, including my Nexus 7 (2013). The latter mostly sits in a drawer now, being taken out only when I want to go further than a few rooms over and have a computing device with me. Nearly three and a half years ago, when the Nexus 7 (2013) was new, this would have been inconceivable. Even high end laptops were prohibitively heavier, larger, and had worse battery life, not to mention they still in some cases ran hot and had noisy fans. They also typically had low resolution (>200 PPI) and poorly calibrated screens (sometimes even with a sub-sRGB gamut and a TN panel), which made media consumption a significantly worse experience than you could get on much cheaper tablet (and smartphone) hardware. Especially in the PC space, the hardware has since gotten much better (the lingering MacBook Air range being a notable exception). Over the years, the list of exclusive advantages one could get from buying a tablet has grown shorter, and new product categories (2-in-1s, large smartphones) have emerged to draw away market share. I'm actually glad tablets happened, as they seem to have been a great catalyst to make the other computing categories improve. Mike I purchased and used a Nexus 10 quite a bit when I had a Galaxy Nexus. After getting a Note 2 I just didn't see the need anymore. I tried to convert it to be a laptop replacement but all of the keyboard/mouse peripherals were pretty bad. About a year or two ago I purchased an Asus Chromebook Flip and for half the price of the Nexus 10 it does so much more (Albeit, it was released a couple years later but still, a tablet can't do what a dedicated laptop can). As someone who was one of the biggest fans of tablets when they first started becoming mainstream (Owned a Tab S2, Nexus 7, Nexus 10) I wouldn't mind if they just died off at this point. PVL_93_RU No surprise there, really The classic tablets as we know them are slowly becoming less popular because the tech advancements in them have slowed down, people aren't needed to replace their current tablets with newer models as often as phones, and the introduction of projects like RemixOS or the Android App compatibility in ChromeOS, as well as the rising spread of convertibles, is making the classic tablet pretty much an obsolete product Unless the tablet market makes a revolution of some sort (be it in functionality or hardware etc) - the decline will only continue. Hell, even Apple is struggling, despite bringing the Pro and the Mini to the table justmy2pennies2012 My Ipad Air is 3 1/2 years old. My only complaint is I purchased the LTE verison and it only has 16GB. It still does what I need it to do, comsume media, web surf, etc. I use my Laptop for my computing needs. I would love to replace it with an Android tablet. My son still has a Nexus 2012/2013 tablet but it is slow has heck. He prefers his Android phone over his old as heck android tablet. I tend to replace my phone evry 22-24 months, but tend to go 3-4 years on a tablet. The newer Ipad isn't to bad feature and price wise IMHO. I had the first Moto tablet (yes the heavy one) but returned it within 30 days back in 2010. I think once manufacturers can produce a quality tablet in a mid price range (not too expensive not too cheap where they can't support it), sales will increase. With the lower price of the newer Ipads,this makes it harder for android tablets to compete on features and price. 1966CAH The only people really surprised by this are the ones who hopped aboard the "Tablets are the Next Big Thing!!!" hypetrain. There's a market for tablets just like there's a market for smartwatches. Neither of them have or likely will fulfill the pipe dreams of their early cheerleaders. They have largely achieved their market saturation point is all, and the demand just isn't what was hyped. I had both versions of the Nexus 7 and now have the Shield K1. When I get home at night, I put down the phone and use the tablet almost exclusively. I don't have any need to upgrade until such time as mine bites the dust or it's too obsolete, but when the time comes I will be looking to replace it. Colin Rowlands If you are mostly using a tablet for consuming media and browsing, there simply isn't any real need to upgrade a tablet until your current one dies, so it is no wonder that sales are decreasing. Bernhard Mähr Waiting since two years for a good 7" table with recent Android version. Ricardo Torres Still using my Nvidia Shield Tablet original not K1 but I did get a k1 as a backup after that recall scare. Use it every day have not had a reason to get a new tablet.

Shares could exceed $1,000 by summer and gain 20% in a year. By Jack Hough Biography Updated May 6, 2017 1:46 a.m. ET As Amazon.com stock nears its 20th birthday, its long-term holders have already enjoyed many happy returns. The price has soared from $2 to $934, adjusted for splits, since the first day of trading on May 15, 1997. That puts Amazon’s market value at $450 billion, making it the fourth-largest U.S. company, behind Apple (ticker: AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT). No company has ever reached such a size with so little in cumulative profit—about $5 billion since going public. Alphabet, by comparison, has earned $90 billion over just the past five years. Apple has made more than that over the past two years.... Get The Full Story Subscribe   or   Log In Want to participate in the discussion? Already a subscriber? Log in for complete access.

(Image for representation, Source: Reuters) Apple has leapt to the lead in wearable computing on strong sales of its smartwatch, a market survey shows.The survey released by Strategy Analytics showed Apple grabbed a 15.9 per cent share of the wearables market in the first quarter. While Apple does not release sales figures for its Apple Watch, the estimate by Strategy Analytics showed a 59 percent jump in sales from a year earlier, with 3.5 million units sold in the first three months of the year. “The new Apple Watch Series 2 is selling relatively well in the US, UK and elsewhere, due to enhanced styling, intensive marketing and a good retail presence,” said Strategy Analytics executive director Neil Mawston. Fitbit, which has been a longtime leader of the wearables market with its fitness bands, slipped to third place on a 36 percent slide in sales in the first quarter, the research firm said. The survey found that China’s Xiaomi, which makes a budget-priced fitness band, was the second-largest vendor with a 15.5 per cent global market share, ahead of Fitbit’s 13.2 percent.”Fitbit has lost its wearables leadership to Apple, due to slowing demand for its fitness bands and a late entry to the emerging smartwatch market,” said Strategy Analytics researcher Cliff Raskind. Also Read: Fitbit beats low expectations on stronger-than-expected demand “Fitbit’s shipments, revenue, pricing and profit are all shrinking at the moment and the company has a major fight on its hands to recover this year.”Overall, the report said sales of wearables rose 21 percent from a year earlier to 22 million units, led by stronger demand for new smartwatch models.

This week, we learned that Apple now has cash reserves totalling an incredible $256.8 billion – more than the GDP of most countries on earth. That’s led to rampant speculation from analysts that Apple may soon use some of this ultra-liquid cash pile for large-scale acquisitions. According to Citigroup analyst Jim Suva, there’s a 40% chance that Apple will buy out Netflix, but he also listed six other companies that are prime targets. Below we’ll outline the companies Suva reckons may get bought out by Apple. We’ve listed the companies alongside their market capitalisation, which is the value of a single share multiplied by the number of shares issued – just one way of measuring a company’s overall worth: 1. Netflix: Founded in 1997, Netflix is now one of the world’s biggest streaming companies, serving nearly 100 million subscribers in over 190 countries. It currently has a market cap of $68.22 billion. 2. Walt Disney: Disney is one of the biggest multinational mass media and entertainment conglomerates globally, turning over $55 billion last year. It currently has a market cap of $176.37 billion. 3. Tesla: Created by PayPal co-founder Elon Musk in 2003, Tesla is now a major vendor of cars, solar panels, and energy storage devices. It currently has a market cap of $48.10 billion. 4. Activision Blizzard: Created in 2008 thanks to a merger of Vivendi and Activision, Activision Blizzard is a global video games development giant, owning major franchise like Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, and Candy Crush. It currently has a market cap of $40.76 billion. 5. Electronic Arts: Like Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts is a major game developer, running franchises like FIFA, Madden, and Battlefield. It currently has a market cap of $29.72 billion. 6. Take Two Interactive Software: Take Two is a games developer and, although smaller than Activision and EA, operates major franchises like Grand Theft Auto and BioShock. It currently has a market cap of $6.6 billion. 7. Hulu: Like Netflix, Hulu is a subscription video service – but it only operates in the USA and Japan unfortunately. It doesn’t have a market cap because it’s owned as a joint venture by other publicly traded companies: Disney (30%), Fox (30%), Comcast (30%), and Time Warner (10%). It’s important to remember that Apple hasn’t indicated that it wants to purchase any of these companies, and the company has been bearish about large-scale acquisitions in the past. While Suva may be on the mark here, Reuters rates his recommendations on Apple as three out of five stars. Related: Best TV Do you think Apple should buy Netflix? Would it be for better or worse?

Due to the range of models, operating systems and constant updates it can be hard to choose the right system that is going to last. With so much choice just a few clicks away, The Telegraph has broken down some of the main questions you should be asking when making a purchase and selected some of the best laptops, notebooks and Chromebooks you can buy, from the top performers to those which won’t break the bank. What kind of laptop do I need? Even before you get down to the details it helps to know what sort of device you are looking for. Do you need your device for the home or on the move? Will you only use it for email and web browsing? Will you want to stream videos or play video games? For something cheap and portable a smaller Chromebook or laptop with low weight and a screen of around 11 inches would work, such as the Acer Chromebook R11 or the HP Steam 11. Both of these will set you back under £250, although sacrifice power and storage capacity. If you are using your laptop for email, typing documents or using the internet you may only need to spend a few hundred pounds, while you may need to spend a little more to stream videos to a higher quality. For gaming you will need a more powerful device with a quality graphics card. The Dell Inspiron 15 7000 Gaming is at the cheaper end of the scale for this, more expensive brands can cost thousands of pounds. And if you demand the highest specifications for video or photo editing you may want to look to a powerful MacBook. A number of laptops are now also ‘two-in-one’ devices, that can act as a tablet by detaching from the keyboard. Other laptops also feature touchscreens with stylus pens, such as the Lenovo Yoga Book. Do I want a Windows laptop, MacBook or Chromebook? Current devices broadly run on three different operating systems that run on the three main varieties of laptop: Windows 10 These are some of the most common devices and run Microsoft's Windows operating system. They are able to perform some of the widest ranging tasks and also have the greatest variety in models, brands and pricing. Pros: Commonly used, greatest access to programs and apps, best for gaming Cons: Considered more vulnerable to viruses MacBook The MacBook Pro, MacBook and MacBook Air are all Apple laptops running on macOS. They are generally seen as powerful, smooth and highly reliable. Pros: Best for high performance use of creative software, connectivity to other Apple products and services Cons: Limited access to some programs, expensive Chromebook Google’s ChromeOS used on Chromebooks is largely limited to online use, essentially operating like a web browser. Rather than installing programs users access them through Google's Chome Web Store. They have limited storage capacity, but are fast and inexpensive. Pros: Cheap, fast, user friendly Cons: Largely limited to online use and Google applications Macbook Pro 2016 v Surface Book i7 01:33 Jargon buster | A rough guide to tech terminology How much do I want to spend? The most important consideration to many buyers is cost; a low price doesn't always have to mean sacrificing performance if your laptop can still run the tasks you need. Nowadays you can pick up a cheap laptop or Chromebook for less than £250. You will be quite limited in terms of performance on a laptop, although you could get a decent Chromebook for around that price. For between £500 and £750 you should be expecting at least an Intel Core i5 processor with 8GB of RAM or better, which will perform more complicated tasks faster. Spending £1,000 and up you would be looking at a premium product sporting the latest generation of Intel Core i5 or i7 processors. You would want this for high intensity work such as video editing or gaming. A recent price surge from some Apple products and others has pushed more top laptops into this bracket. What else to consider Screen size: Obviously a smaller screen means a smaller laptop, increasing its  portability. Larger screen models will also need high resolution to create the perfect picture, but can be better if you want a more accessible screen or want to open lots of tabs. Weight: If you plan to lug your laptop to classes or work, you may want something that weighs 1.5kg or less. If it is going to sit on your desk most of the day you can always go for a bulkier model, which may be cheaper than a sleek ultrabook. Battery life: If you're going to be using your laptop at your desk for most of the time, battery life will be less of an issue, but if you work on the go or in a coffee shop, you don't want to get caught without power at a crucial moment. Some dedicated gaming laptops may only last four hours when under strain, while ultraportables can manage 12 hours or better. Under £500 Best for Windows on a budget: Acer Swift 3 Credit: Acer Screen: 14 inches Weight: 1.5kg Battery life: 10 hours For a Windows-running performer, the Acer Swift 3 has the feel of a pricier laptop for under £500, with its smooth aluminium case reminiscent of more up-market devices. The most basic model has an Intel i3 processor with an 128GB SSD  and 8GB of RAM, enough for most daily tasks. Other features include a backlit keyboard and fingerprint scanner, and the Swift 3 is fairly connection-friendly with HDMI, USB and USB-C. The drawbacks are largely limited to screen brightness. Improved processors will set you back another £250, although that is still great value for a solid device. Pros: Solid Windows Ultrabook at an excellent price Cons: Screen brightness a little low Cost: £499 Buy Now Also consider: Lenovo Yoga 510 2-in-1 (£379) Best for practicality: HP Chromebook 14 Credit: HP Screen: 14 inches Weight: 1.7 kg Battery life: 9.25 hours For a bigger screen Chromebook this HP is a useable device at a reasonable price. The HP Chromebook 14 lacks some of the flashy touch screens of the latest generation, but comes with plenty of practical features including three USB ports, an SD card slot and HDMI connection. In addition, the 1920x1080 screen resolution will provide a crisp, quality picture. This larger Chromebook will easily see you through most routine tasks. Pros: Large screen and practical features Cons: Not the cheapest for a Chromebook Price: £331.98 Buy Now Also consider: Acer Chromebook 15 (£239.99) Best for simple stuff: Acer Chromebook R11 Credit: Acer Screen: 11.6 inches Weight: 1.25 kg Battery life: 12 hours At the cheaper end of the market, the Acer ChromeBook R11 comes in at around £250 and looks good with a crisp white finish and aluminium top panel. The R11 features a stylish touchscreen with 360 degree rotation, although the resolution is a little low at 1366 x 768 pixels it will look fine on the smaller screen. A solid battery life with its slimmer size and portability make this ideal for use on-the-go. Pros: Value offering with flip screen Cons: Low resolution Price: £249.99 Buy Now Also consider: Asus Chromebook Flip (£249.95) Under £1,000 Best for reliability: MacBook Air Credit: Apple Screen: 13.3 inch Weight: 1.35 kg Battery life: 12 hours It has been two years since the last update to the MacBook Air, with many predicting a phase-out due to the launch of the new MacBook Pro in 2016. However, the Air remains the most affordable Apple notebook you can buy, all the more important given recent jumps in Apple prices. Like most Apple products it is known for a battery life that lives up to expectations, in this case around 12 hours. The laptop also still retains traditional USB slots, unlike more recent Apple updates. While it remains a solid buy, it could be undercut by the upcoming Microsoft Surface Laptop (which will be released in June). Pros: The cheapest MacBook you can buy Cons: Aging design Cost: £949 Buy now Also consider: Microsoft Surface Laptop (£979 - pre order) Best Apple alternative: Lenovo IdeaPad 710s Credit: Lenovo Screen: 13.3 inch Weight: 1.1 kg Battery life: 8 hours A rival to the MacBook Air, the Lenovo IdeaPad 710s has been noted for its similarity in design to Apple’s cheapest model, matching its aluminium bodywork . As a cheaper alternative, the IdeaPad 710s now comes in at around £170 cheaper with an Intel Core i5-7200U processor. It is also thinner (at 14mm) and lighter than the Air. With a display that can rotate to 180 degrees it is also flexible, but on battery life it is not as competitive as some other brands. Pros: Good value for a powerful build Cons: Battery life Cost: £849.95 Buy Now Also consider: Asus Zenbook UX310 (£600) Best for gaming for less: Dell Inspiron 15 7000 Gaming Credit: Dell Screen: 15.6 inches Weight: 2.65kg Battery life: Up to 10.5 hours If you are not willing or unable to spend thousands of pounds on a gaming laptop, the Dell Inspiron 15 7000 Gaming is a decent backup option. It is not going to outrun the high end machines, but for casual gaming you’ll get the performance you need. The cheapest model comes in at under £1,000, which is a steal for a gaming ready device. The design includes Ethernet, SD, HDMI and USB ports and comes in a smart black and red finish. Pros: The best gaming laptop on a budget Cons: Not for hardcore gamers Cost: £899 Buy now Also consider: MSI GL62 (£849) Best for standing out: Lenovo Yoga Book Credit: Lenovo Screen: 10.1 inch Weight: 0.689 kg Battery life: 15 hours A stunning laptop/tablet hybrid launched last year, the Lenovo Yoga Book features an innovative keyboard and touchpad that stand out from the latest generation of devices. The Yoga Book features no physical keyboard, instead presenting a virtual one which only switches on when you start using it. As well as a touch screen, the Yoga Book pushes itself as a device you can really write on, clipping a notepad over the virtual keyboard sees notes and drawings transmitted onto the main screen. While it's an exciting offering at a low price, the keyboard is considered tricky to get used to, but the overall product is light, portable, and certainly something different. Pros: Innovative design and featherweight Cons: Touchpad keyboard will take some getting used to. Cost: £549  Buy now Money no object Best all-rounder: Dell XPS 13 Credit: Dell Screen: 13.3 inches Weight: 1.29kg Battery life: 13 hours The highly rated Dell XPS 13 is considered the lead challenger to the MacBook Pro. The XPS 13 features a virtually borderless 13.3 inch Infinity Edge display, which is available with touch. Dell also claims the laptop offers up to 22 hours of battery life, although in practice this is more like 12 to 13 hours when streaming video. The latest models also run on Kaby Lake processors, Intel's newest and more powerful seventh generation processor. Without the touch display you could currently pick up the new model for £1,149, but with it included the XPS 13 will set you back £1,279. The main drawback is an awkwardly placed webcam, sitting to the bottom left of the screen. Pros: Top of the range display, superb battery Cons: Awkward webcam placement Cost: £1,149 Buy now Also consider: HP Spectre 13 (£1,149.95) Best for Apple addicts: MacBook Pro Credit: GEOFF PUGH/TELEGRAPH Screen: 13.3 inches Weight: 1.37kg Battery life: 10 hours Coming four years after Apple’s last high-end laptop, the latest MacBook Pro is thinner, more powerful and features innovations not seen on other laptops, such as its 'Touch Bar' and a Touch ID fingerprint scanner. The Touch Bar offers shortcuts and replacing function keys, but is not supported on many apps just yet. And the new edition has done away with some staple features, dropping support for standard USB sticks and SD cards, meaning you may have to buy new dongles or wires for its USB-C ports. Models with the Touch Bar and fingerprint scanner will also set you back £1,749 compared to £1,499 for the basic 13 inch model. But overall, the new MacBook Pro remains the top performing device for Apple lovers, with a beautiful screen, exquisite 'butterfly' keyboard and easy-to-use trackpad. Pros: High performance, Apple-style keyboard and trackpad Cons: Touch Bar has limited uses, price Price: £1,499 Buy now Also consider: Macbook 12-inch (£1,249) Best for versatility: Microsoft Surface Book Credit: Warren Allott/Daily Telegraph Screen: 13.5 inches Weight: 1.6 kg Battery life: 12 hours Microsoft’s first ever laptop launched in the UK last year and the Surface Book features a detachable 13.5 inch display and highly flexible hinge which gives Microsoft’s "ultimate laptop" the added versatility of a tablet. The Surface Book has Microsoft calls a 'dynamic fulcrum hinge' connecting the keyboard and display to hold the heavier screen in place, since it holds all the parts to operate as a tablet. The keyboard can also hold an optional discrete GPU, or graphics processor, which gives the laptop added power. This does add to the weight and top end price, and the Intel Core i5 model with the discrete GPU costs around £400 more.

You know, those messages that pop up alerting you to things like email, Facebook friend requests, text messages, or a Twitter response. Lots of applications use these push notifications and with the release of iOS 5, Apple has included something called Notification Center, a centralized hub for your notifications. You can access it by swiping down from the top of the screen although you probably knew that already. Well, for some of you, these notifications might be more annoying then useful and if that’s the case, we’re here to help you get rid of them once and for all, if that’s really what you want to do. We must warn you, the process is a bit tedious as Apple now requires you to disable push notifications for each individual application. But luckily, you’ll only have to do it once. 1) Open up Settings on your iPhone. 2) Head to Notifications. 3) If  you’re able to scroll down for what seems like an eternity, you’re on the right page. Apple has grouped this page into two categories. The first is In Notification Center. These are, as you may have surmised, the applications that currently pop up in your Notification Center. There are a bunch of them included in there by default. If you want to disable them from popping up in the Notification Center, you’ll want to go into each one and flip the Notification Center toggle to Off. 4) The second is Not In Notification Center. This is where the apps that you disable will go. By the end, every single app you have on your iPhone should show up in this section. 5) Now here is the terrible part. You’re going to have to go app by app to ensure that push notifications are turned off. Some, like Facebook, appear within your Settings. Go in, scroll down to Push Notifications, and flick them all to off. That’s just one example. Other applications will require you to open them, and then head to the Settings within the app. If you have a lot of apps, this could take awhile. 6) Four and a half weeks later, after you’ve gone into each individual apps Settings, your iPhone should be void of any notifications popping up and disrupting things. It might sound kind of scary but after awhile, you’ll enjoy the tranquility. 7) You’re close, but you’re not done yet. You’ll also want to disable Wi-Fi network notifications. You can find out how to do that by heading here. 8) Also, quick side note. Often times, after installing them, apps will prompt you and ask if you want to enable Push Notifications. You’ll want to say no. This will help keep your notifications silenced going forward. 14 Responses 07/13/2012 Kit Reply Thank you! 10/08/2012 CREED Reply Thanks u but how can turn the update notification on the settings app 11/14/2012 FalconFlyer Reply thanks some of my apps kept getting daily notifications and would go off at like 2:am, hopefully they wont now. 07/22/2013 asdf Reply unfortunately every time you update apps (and most apps update at least once a week) the notification setting is reverted to ON. so you’ll have to do this every week. horrible design imo. 08/23/2013 Doug Hansen Reply What asdf said and, i have apps that reside in my “Not in notification center” that still give me pops. I have just resigned myself to it. 11/11/2013 bwilkie74 Reply The notification that pops up when you add iMessage to all apple devices. How do you stop that 07/14/2015 Teresa Wood Reply Please help I haven’t got Facebook on my iPhone but I got it on my iPad every time I get a notification on my pad my iPhone goes off…..

Skip to main content asia one Singapore Malaysia China Asia World Singapore Malaysia China Asia World Business Showbiz Health Food Apple keeps getting richer, even though it's selling fewer iPhones than a year ago Apple CEO Tim Cook PHOTO: Reuters Anita Balakrishnan CNBC May 06, 2017 Apple reported earnings on Tuesday, and in it revealed how many iPhones it sold during the quarter ending in March. And the answer is a bit puzzling. Apple sold 50.76 million iPhones during the quarter, just barely below the 51.19 million sold in the year-ago period. Yet the company's earnings and revenue are up from a year ago. In the 2017 March quarter, Apple reported adjusted earnings of $2.10 per diluted share on revenue of $52.9 billion, up from earnings of $1.90 a share on revenue of $50.56 billion this time last year. That has to do with the how the iPhone 7 Plus has boosted the average selling price of Apple's phones: $655, compared to $642 a year ago. Unsurprisingly, the company has a crazy amount of cash: $256.8 billion, to be exact. And shares are up a whopping 57.5 per cent over the past year. Apple released a special red edition of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus this spring. The handsets are the lifeblood of the massive company, which briefly reached a record valuation of over $775 billion on Tuesday. But the world's most valuable company is having trouble cracking the competitive China market, where sales fell 14 per cent from a year ago. Cook told investors on a conference call that he expected that market to improve, but not come back to growth. Some people may also be delaying smartphone purchases in anticipation of a new, fancier forthcoming phone, chief executive Tim Cook told CNBC. But a mix of more expensive phones and other products and services is helping the company supplement its flattening iPhone shipments. Apple boss Tim Cook said the that the iPhone 7 Plus sales were "extremely strong." "We are having significant growth rates beyond what we ever dreamed of," Cook said of the higher-priced model. He added in a conference call, though, that prior generations iPhones didn't perform as well in China. The iPhone 7 Plus, which ditched the headphone jack and featured a souped-up dual camera, is being closely tracked as a precursor to the next iPhone, expected to hit in the autumn and potentially feature major upgrades like wireless charging and 3-D sensing. Apple is also seeing some revenue growth from some unexpected places. Other products, like the much-maligned Apple TV, Apple Watch and AirPods, saw revenue jump 31 per cent from a year ago. And services, like AppleCare and the App Store, saw 18 per cent growth. Even the Mac saw double-digit growth during the quarter. Apple has planned to revamp its stores, in part to draw in services spending. Still, services, Mac and other products combined only provide about half the level of revenue as the iPhone.

PHOTO: REUTERS Citigroup listed seven companies as potential takeover targets for Apple, including Netflix, Walt Disney and Tesla , as a way to put its cash hoard of more than $250 billion to work. With over 90 per cent of its cash sitting overseas, a one-time 10 per cent repatriation tax would give Apple $220 billion for acquisitions or buybacks, Citigroup analyst Jim Suva said in a note to clients. US President Donald Trump’s tax blueprint, which was unveiled last month, proposes allowing multinationals to bring in overseas profits at a tax rate of 10 per cent versus 35 per cent now. Apple starting US tech manufacturing fund with $1 bn “Since one of the new administration’s top priorities is to allow US companies to repatriate overseas cash at a lower tax rate, Apple may have a more acute need to put this cash to use,” Suva said. The analyst is rated three out of five stars for his recommendations on Apple, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine. Apple unveils updated iPad at lowest-ever price The other potential acquisition targets include video game developers Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts and Take Two Interactive Software as well as video streaming service Hulu. The analyst said the targets were screened considering five criteria – strategic fit, global scale, transaction size, few non-strategic assets and likely impact on Apple’s share price. Under pressure from shareholders to hand over more of its cash hoard, Apple recently boosted its capital return program by $50 billion, increased its share buyback program by $35 billion and raised its quarterly dividend by 10.5 per cent.

The survey released Thursday by Strategy Analytics showed Apple grabbed a 15.9 percent share of the wearables market in the first quarter. While Apple does not release sales figures for its Apple Watch, the estimate by Strategy Analytics showed a 59 percent jump in sales from a year earlier, with 3.5 million units sold in the first three months of the year. “The new Apple Watch Series 2 is selling relatively well in the US, UK and elsewhere, due to enhanced styling, intensive marketing and a good retail presence,” said Strategy Analytics executive director Neil Mawston. Fitbit, which has been a longtime leader of the wearables market with its fitness bands, slipped to third place on a 36 percent slide in sales in the first quarter, the research firm said. The survey found that China’s Xiaomi, which makes a budget-priced fitness band, was the second-largest vendor with a 15.5 percent global market share, ahead of Fitbit’s 13.2 percent. “Fitbit has lost its wearables leadership to Apple, due to slowing demand for its fitness bands and a late entry to the emerging smartwatch market,” said Strategy Analytics researcher Cliff Raskind. “Fitbit’s shipments, revenue, pricing and profit are all shrinking at the moment and the company has a major fight on its hands to recover this year.” Overall, the report said sales of wearables rose 21 percent from a year earlier to 22 million units, led by stronger demand for new smartwatch models.

Engst We’re approaching another of those inflection points where Apple leaves some apps — and their users — behind. When you launched an older 32-bit app in iOS 10, it first warned that the app might slow down your device. That was, as far as I could tell, not the case, but it was still disconcerting. With iOS 10.3, however, Apple went further, stating in no uncertain terms that the app would stop working with some future version of iOS. As to when that will be, there’s no telling, but iOS 11 would seem to be likely. The iPhone 5s was the first iPhone with a 64-bit processor, and since it shipped in September 2013, developers have had the option to have their apps run in 64-bit mode. Starting in 2015, Apple has required apps to run in 64-bit mode to receive App Store approval. The practical upshot of Apple’s iOS warnings is that most apps that haven’t been updated since 2015 will likely be rendered inoperable by whatever future version of iOS pulls the plug on 32-bit apps. I can’t imagine that there will be any way to keep running such apps, short of refusing to update to that version of iOS. In iOS 10.3, Apple made it possible to see which of your apps will be affected. Navigate to Settings > General > About > Applications. The number next to Applications is the total number of apps installed, but when you tap Applications to see what’s inside, you see a list of 32-bit apps that have no updates available. Tap any app to see its listing in the App Store, from which you can tap through to the developer’s Web site and theoretically ask if there will be an update. In most cases, the answer will likely be no. To bring that question home to roost, what about the TidBITS News app? The answer is, you guessed it, no, we will not be updating it. Written by Matt Neuburg and last updated in January 2013 for iOS 6, the TidBITS News app simply isn’t used by many people, and most of those who are using it have updated to iOS 10. As you can see in the stats for April 2017, fewer than 50 people per day are using it. It should continue to work in current versions of iOS for now. At its heart, TidBITS News is just an RSS reader dedicated to TidBITS, so you can easily replace it with Apple’s built-in News app. To add TidBITS to your Favorites list in News, search for TidBITS in News and either tap the heart icon next to the appropriate search result, or tap the search result itself and then the heart icon in the upper right corner. From then on, just tap Favorites in the News toolbar and then the TidBITS tile to see all our articles. If you want to add an RSS feed to News but can’t find it with a search from within News, you can use Safari. Navigate to the Web site in question, tap the share icon, and then tap Open in News in the share sheet. Once you’re in News, tap the name at the top of the screen to go to the main article list, and tap the heart button there. You can, of course, use any other RSS reader too, but only TidBITS members get access to the full-text RSS feed for use in other apps. If you are a TidBITS member, access the full-text feed by logging in and clicking the RSS link in the upper left of our Web site.   PDFpen and PDFpenPro 9 add 100+ enhancements to improve your PDF editing experience, with annotations, Tables of Contents, and more export options.

Your comment will appear after you follow a link in the one-time confirmation message we send to verify that you're a real person. The writing is on the wall for 32-bit iOS apps that haven’t seen updates in years — they will stop working in a future version of iOS. That includes the TidBITS News app that a few people still use. Happily, you can easily replace it with any RSS reader, including Apple’s built-in News app. Receive comments via RSS Add a comment James Atkinson  2017-05-05 11:04 I appear to be one of the 50 daily users and have appreciated having a one-stop shop for TidBits content. Thank you for stepping through the Apple News/RSS alternative, which I'll do today. Farewell, TidBits News app! Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 11:11 Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but Apple's News app should work just fine for you. Reply david cuddy   2017-05-05 13:17 Not if you're in Canada. The iOS News app still isn't available here. Probably because we don't have 'Fake News'. Oddly, the News widget does appear on my Today page, and the -1 Home page. But there's no way to control the sources of the news feeds it uses. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 13:22 Still? Sheesh... sorry about that. Reeder or Feedly should work in that case. Reply Frans Moquette  2017-05-05 18:41 I seem to be one of the 50 also, but also no Apple News app on my iPad. I'm in The Netherlands (aka Holland). I do have Newsify, will that work? Otherwise, back to reading with Safari? Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 19:06 I haven't used Newsify, but from what I see on their product page, yes, it should work. Just get the RSS feed URL from the RSS link in the upper left of our Web site (full text for TidBITS members). Safari's Reader view does a pretty good job too for individual articles. Reply Lewis Butler   2017-05-05 11:20 How it was explained to me is that iOS 10 doesn't load 32 bit libraries until it has to, so running a 32-bit app can easily slow down your entire device depending on how much memory you have and how much you switch apps. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 11:24 Could be, but in practice, I never noticed any change after running such an app on my iPhone 7. Perhaps it had sufficient RAM and CPU power to mask any slowdowns. Reply Martin Stoermer  2017-05-05 11:37 Quite a few paid apps on my phone are marked as being on this scrap heap. Some have new versions available with a new name for new $, which I'm a bit grumpy about. In the case of the free ones it's a bit bit annoying but meh. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 11:41 I totally understand and empathize with the irritation of needing to buy new apps, but you should lay that blame squarely at Apple's feet, since they created a situation where developers have no choice but to chase new sales instead of supporting loyal customers. If developers were allowed to charge for upgrades, there would be financial incentive to keep up with existing apps. Reply Frans Moquette  2017-05-05 19:01 I agree. With non-paid updates/upgrades Apple has done developers a big disservice. But not only developers, users also. When you have to switch to a new app, you cannot acces your data in the old app, unless the data is in a cloud storage or the developer has provided a way to transfer it. If the old app does not work anymore on the new OS, you would loose all your data if you were not able to transfer it before the app stopped working Not a great user experience I would think, for which only Apple is to blame. Reply Christopher Smith  2017-05-05 19:33 While I can certainly understand that developers wish they could charge for upgrades (and why it incentivizes improvements to apps), it seems to me that allowing one's app to languish into obsolescence will definitely inhibit future sales. Reply Frans Moquette  2017-05-06 05:19 I agree with that too. Thing is, all products follow an S-shaped growth curve. Older product will be in the top of that curve with little to no new sales. The effort needed to update an older product often does not warrant the revenue from new sales, if any. Reply JohnB (SciFiOne)   2017-05-05 13:43 I knew Glyder would stop working some day. Oh well. But it will be a while yet since I gave up and now only update software and hardware when I have to. Not as secure, but less expensive and so much easier (except that I make even more offline backups to be safe). Reply Anonymous  2017-05-05 14:55 What I would like to comment on is have an iPhone 4s iPad 4/128 both still running iOS 9.3.5. I have been reluctant to move the iPad to iOS 10, I keep erasing the software update (hanging in storage) because of the tricks Apple keeps trying to make me update the iPad 4. Since I have a fixed income and cannot see sense in a new iPhone 5s or 4SE that are 64bit and I haven't been won over with possibilities iOS 10, and without possible compatibility between devices. So this is what I am wondering? 1.What if I update one but not the other, anyone with insight or expertise foresee problems between iProducts? 2.This is in reference to the below info (under FYI), if I update the iPad to 10, I know I cannot go back is it worth it. Any help? 3.Since this is a sandbox world closing in, is it time to just freeze my technology now before it made useless by having to afford the latest and greatest Apple product (or Microsoft)every 2-5 years? Just an FYI: Also my two Mac Pros are is similar place one a 2006/8 2,1 I upgrade the hardware my self to an 8-core so I frozen myself to 10.9.5 world with (64on32) and the used 2010 5,1 model can run 10.11 or 10.12 which seem to iffy, with all the beta crashing of Sierra I had.. At least I can roll back to my macOS of choice 10.9.5 on a different boot drive of the Mac Pro 5,1. ~Barry Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 16:45 It's hard to make concrete recommendations without knowing all the details, but it sounds like it might make sense to keep iOS 9.3.5 on both your devices, particularly if that matches with your Mac Pros and the equivalent version of iTunes (honestly, I don't know what versions match up offhand). If you start upgrading things piecemeal, you will end up in a situation where something won't talk to something else, but it's hard to predict how that will happen. The main thing to be aware of is that you aren't getting security updates, so you should be extra careful to avoid dodgy parts of the Internet. At some point, some hardware will probably fail and force you to get something new, and that may be the event that encourages upgrading everything to the latest and greatest. Reply David Morrison   2017-05-05 22:14 There is definitely a problem with upgrading iDevices if you connect them to a Mac and the Mac is not running a very recent version of OS X. Basically, older versions of iTunes will not talk to newer versions of IOS. What you get is a dialogue every time you plug in the device telling you this and advising you to upgrade iTunes - very annoying, since newer versions of iTunes will not run on older versions of OS X! So say you are running OS X 10.8 with iTunes 12. Your iDevices are running IOS 9.3.5. This works fine. You then decide to upgrade to IOS 10 on a device. If you try to do it through iTunes, it will say you need to upgrade iTunes - this warning is pretty vague, and does not raise any alarms. Unfortunately, iTunes 12 is the last version that will run on OS X 10.8. So your only option is to upgrade OS X which may not be acceptable. So you upgrade the device to IOS 10 over the Internet directly. Then plug it in to your Mac and get a warning from iTunes that it cannot talk to the device. Oops! No more backups of your device. No copying data files from apps to your Mac. No managing apps on your Mac. What does work is that iPhoto will still transfer photos, and probably Image Capture too. Third party file access apps on the Mac can also access the device. It seems to just be iTunes that does not work. Beware also that if you buy a new iDevice, it will not work with iTunes on your old Mac either. Sadly there is definitely no going back after the upgrade. You are stuck with IOS 10. Reply Derek Roff   2017-05-05 16:23 "The number next to Applications is the total number of apps installed, but when you tap Applications to see what’s inside, you see a list of 32-bit apps that have no updates available. " I'm not seeing exactly what you describe in the article, on my iPad 4 with iOS 10.3.1. When I tap on Applications, I see the number of apps (100), and "inside", I see the text you list about "These apps may slow down your iPad...". No app names appear directly below that. Then I see in grey text "Updates available". Below that are app names, including apps that I upgraded today. I haven't counted, but I think all 100 apps might appear in this group. This includes major apps like App Store, Remote, FaceTime, Google, YouTube, Amazon Prime Video, Dropbox, etc. It doesn't make sense to me that these are all 32-bit applications, but it's likely that some of the apps I have installed are. I haven't been able to guess the ordering system for this list. It isn't alphabetical. It isn't by age, install date, or most recent update. Tapping an arrow next to most apps will take me to the App Store, and show me that no update is available. A few say that the app is not available in the App Store. Below the last app on this list is grey text saying "No Updates Available". There are no apps listed under these words. Can you give us a few more words about this app list, and how to interpret the groupings and ordering? Thanks. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 16:41 My best guess is that it's confused. :-) What I'd try is going to the App Store app, making sure that everything is updated, and then restart the iPhone (hold down both buttons until it restarts). Reply Derek Roff   2017-05-05 17:15 Thanks for your response, Adam. A restart changed nothing for me, and the App Store shows no updates available. I guess I will wait and see what happens with the next iOS upgrade. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 17:17 The other thing you could try is signing out in Settings > iTunes & App Stores. Then sign back in and see if it has figured things out better. Reply Timothy Pearson  2017-05-05 16:22 Reading TidBITS in Apple News doesn't work for me. Following your prescription, I added it to my favorites; but it only shows one article since 3 October 2016, and several unrelated articles about "Tidbits" from other sites. If the iOS app stops working, I guess I will have to use the webpage instead. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 16:47 It sounds like your search hit "Tidbits" as a topic, rather than "TidBITS" as the publication. Try again, and make sure the one you're selecting has our capitalization. Tap it, and make sure it's our content, then tap the heart icon at the top right. Reply brent  2017-05-05 18:18 thanks guys! guess i wasn't the only one to ask, lol. i liked the app, really just to catch specific articles i see noted in FB or tweets. but the apple news will do. irony, i had never used apple news until now. keep up the good work, you are still my "go to" resource. Reply Roland G  2017-05-05 19:28 I'm an iOS developer since 2009. I have updated many apps to support 64bit and it really isn't a big deal. The developers of these apps just need to update their apps to support both 32/64 and all is well. At some point Apple needs to move on with their OS and I fully support that. If you don't want to update to 11, don't update, simple as that. Reply David Morrison   2017-05-05 22:24 I use the app occasionally, when in waiting rooms or travelling, but generally prefer the weekly roundup that arrives by e-mail. That said, I prefer the app's layout to News. News just shows the first few lines of each article to give you an idea of what it is about. This is often not helpful. In the app, there is a paragraph summarising the article, which often meant you did not even have to read the article if it was not of interest - a huge time saver. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-06 18:49 Hmm, I see what you mean — Apple News doesn't provide our blurb, just the first few lines of the article. I don't think there's any way to do that in News with an RSS feed. It might be possible with Apple News Format, but that's a whole 'nother ball of development wax. :-) Reply David Morrison   2017-05-05 22:31 I am having trouble adding the member version of the RSS feed. I logged in with Safari and clicked on RSS feed. It asked me if I wanted to open it in News. I said yes, then it told me the story could not be found. Tidbits does not appear in the favourites list. Going back to repeat this process, when I click on RSS, I get a message from Safari: Cannot open page Safari cannot open the page because the address is invalid. Any ideas? Reply David Morrison   2017-05-05 22:35 I quit News, and started again. Safari asked if I wanted to open the link in News. I said Yes. It showed the list of headlines, then said: Story unavailable. This story is not available in News. Given that I had not touched a story, this is mystifying….. Reply David Morrison   2017-05-05 22:37 Even though Tidbits is not listed in Favourites, the Tidbits news items are still being shown….. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-06 18:35 Can you just add it from the search in News? That's generally easier and will give the same result. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-06 18:50 What's weird is that it's working for me in Safari with no problems. Are you logged into the TidBITS site when you start adding? That might make a difference.

The writing is on the wall for 32-bit iOS apps that haven’t seen updates in years — they will stop working in a future version of iOS. That includes the TidBITS News app that a few people still use.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Entertainment Image Source: Harrison Weber, Flickr Apple TV may finally get Amazon Video this summer Chris Mills @chrisfmills May 5th, 2017 at 10:13 PM Share Tweet The Apple TV is a well-rounded set-top streaming machine, provided you don’t need access to Amazon Video. The competitive rivalry between the two companies has caused Amazon to keep its streaming service off the Apple TV, but a new report suggests that could be about to change. Don't Miss: The Galaxy Note 8’s best new feature is supposedly coming early Recode has spoken to sources who suggest that Amazon and Apple are “close to a deal” to bring a streaming app to the Apple TV. If things go to plan, the app should go live in the fall. Any deal is likely to involve Amazon putting the Apple TV back on sale on the Amazon online store. Amazon pulled the Apple TV from its store two years ago, saying that it didn’t want to sell a streaming box that wasn’t compatible with its own services. Amazon is an important retailer for set-top boxes, and the lack of availability of the Apple TV hurts it against Chromecast, Roku, and Amazon’s own Fire TV stick. For Amazon, a discussion over Apple’s revenue split in the App Store could be up for discussion. Currently, Amazon doesn’t offer “in-app purchases” or subscription purchases through its iOS apps, because doing so would mean that Apple gets a cut of every subscription sold, every movie rented or every Kindle book bought. Apple has been loath to change those terms in the past, but some kind of deal could be worked out in private that would bring Amazon to the Apple TV.

Citigroup’s Apple analyst James Suva threw his hat into the ring Friday, covering every conceivable base. Suva suggests the most likely options for Apple are Netflix (40 percent odds) and Disney (25 percent odds). Citi also suggested Apple might even scoop up Elon Musk’s electric-car manufacturer Tesla (5 percent odds), or video-game makers including Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts, or Take-Two Interactive (10 percent each). Suva’s odds-making is prompted by bets that the globe’s most profitable company will benefit from the Trump Administration’s desire for US corporations to bring cash back into the country in return for a lower tax rate. Apple has some $257 billion in cash on its books and has not provided many clues about how it will spend it. But some, including Citi’s Suva, believe Apple could be considering a move to buy a video streaming service. The company’s business selling downloadable music and media has seen declines as consumers move to online streaming instead. SEE ALSO Apple execs vying for original movie, TV deals 0:0 Senior Apple executives have reached out to some of Hollywood’s... Talk of an Apple-Disney combination has also been heating up in the past few months. The Associated Press pointed out a merger would create the world’s first trillion-dollar company. Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told the AP in an interview published on Tuesday, “We are looking at every size of acquisition, so we will see how it goes going forward.” Apple CEO Tim Cook has historically been cautious about big deals. Many thought Apple would go after Time Warner, which instead accepted an offer from AT&T. Apple shares closed the Friday session at $148.96, up 1.7 percent. Cook did spend $3 billion in 2014, acquiring Beats Electronics to help it carve an identity for its Apple Music streaming service.

Amazon Video is reportedly coming to Apple TV this year. (Apple Photo). Anyone with an Apple TV has likely noticed the conspicuously absent Amazon Video app. The device, which allows viewers to stream video from HBO, Netflix, and other services to their TVs has been missing a convenient way to watch Amazon content — until now. According to anonymous sources cited by Recode, the Amazon Video app will be arriving on the Apple TV set-top box this summer. Some of Amazon’s devices compete directly with Apple products, like the Fire TV stick, which also allows viewers to stream content to the TV. So far, the two companies haven’t been able to reach an agreement to bring an Amazon Video app to the Apple TV. The standoff led Amazon to stop selling the Apple TV on its retail site in 2015, as Recode notes. “We want our player, our Prime Video player, to be on the device, and we want it to be on the device with acceptable business terms … and if you can’t, then we don’t want to sell it to our customers, because they’re going to be buying it thinking they can watch Prime Video and then they’re going to be disappointed,” Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said at Recode’s Code Conference last year. “And they’re going to return it.” An agreement between the two tech titans could be a sign of Amazon’s increasing dominance in the streaming video world, as more Apple customers expect access to the content.

Reuters/Jonathan Alcorn Latest reports suggest that Amazon Prime video app may come to Apple TV very soon. It looks like Tim Cook and Jeff Bezos have finally buried the hatchet and Apple and Amazon have reached a truce. Currently, there is no easy way to watch Amazon Prime content on Apple TV. Users have to use AirPlay with another Apple device to do so. The absence of the app from the Apple device is surely a casualty of both the companies’ desire to be the best go-to video streaming service. Reports now claim that this lock could be released soon, as both the companies have put customers at the forefront and not their personal differences. The companies have reportedly gotten into an agreement. Amazon Prime video app could be on Apple TV as soon as the third quarter of this year. This is great news for Amazon Prime subscribers who also own Apple TVs. Once the gap is bridged, they won’t have to rely on streaming video over an AirPlay connection. Even though the number of Amazon Prime subscribers who own Apple TVs are very less, it still is a big step forward. According to Recode, it is not known whether this truce means Apple and Amazon have also settled other disputes. It is also unclear what led the two to go for a settlement, though industry experts believe Bezos and Cook may have met in person to talk business. The deal is happening at a time when Amazon’s video business is becoming really important to Prime. The truce would also mean that the Apple TV will show up on Amazon’s online store. Currently, it does not do so, as Amazon doesn’t want to push such a prime competitor to its Amazon Fire product range. The truce is mutually beneficial. The pact will allow Amazon to take advantage of Apple’s pretty impressive and large Apple TV devotees, as they will now be able to sign up to Amazon’s video platform. Moreover, the ability to slot Amazon Video along with other supported video apps will result in more Apple TV sales. However, in case the Amazon app does come to Apple TV, it would be a reminder of a couple of shortcomings, such as Apple TV’s “inability to support either the 4K resolution or high dynamic range streams Amazon has been offering for well over a year now,” writes Forbes. On the other hand, there are rumours that the Cupertino tech giant may unveil a brand new 4K HDR-capable Apple TV in June at the WWDC. Stay tuned on IBT AU for more updates on the pact between Apple TV and Amazon Prime video app. Submit Correction 0 0 0 Related Apple Watch soars: Apple now world's number one wearables seller Amazon officially heads to Australia with vast selection and fast delivery at low prices Join the Discussion 0 0 0 Search Most Shared Most Read 1 $20,000 visa allows parents of migrants in Australia for 10 years 0 Shares 2 Harry Styles Live On Tour: Tickets on sale May 5 0 Shares 3 Lakers Trade News: Paul George dreams of succeeding idol Kobe Bryant in LA, claims insider 0 Shares 4 ‘MasterChef Australia 2017’ update: 'Brain-fade' and plate smash eliminate first Season 9 contestant 0 Shares 5 ‘Outlander’ season 3 ‘heard on the set’ 0 Shares 6 ‘Outlander’ season 3: Diana Gabaldon explains Rollo casting 0 Shares 7 ‘Outlander’ season 3: Night shoots 0 Shares 8 ‘Pokemon Stars’ could be a completely new sequel 0 Shares 9 ‘Prison Break’ Season 5, Episode 5 update 0 Shares 10 ‘Vikings’ season 5: Cast members undergo ‘physically tough battle scenes’; Lagertha has bloody and beaten up face 0 Shares Follow Us Please enter a valid email Like us Follow us Full site feed Caltex Australia announces $20 million fund to compensate underpaid employees Back to the old fashioned way: Sales of physical books rise, E-book revenue falls Mike Pence assures Trump’s tax reform will benefit Australia Aramco CEO says global oil market moves closer to balance despite US boom Qantas crowned Australia’s most attractive employer NT okays $800m Northern Gas Pipeline, Jemena poised to solve Australia's gas crisis More Business Economy Markets Companies Real Estate Banking & Finance FDA to require restaurants to post nutritional info for their menu starting May 5 Melania Trump welcomes Queen Rania of Jordan, heads to an all-girls school Pump hydro storage can help build 100 percent renewable energy grid Study shows Western Australians are unhappiest at work; older, female employees are more satisfied Egyptians unite after church bombing; Abdel Fatah el-Sisi declares state of emergency Trump to visit China; Xi approves 100-day trade talks plan More News Australia Asia Pacific Africa The Americas Europe Middle East NBA Trade News: Knicks received offers for a Kristaps Porzingis trade Jay Cutler follows Tony Romo broadcasting career with NFL stint on hold Big Baller Brand debuts Lonzo Ball ZO2 kicks with LaVar fingerprints all over NBA Trade News: Thunder determined to trade Enes Kanter this offseason Magic Johnson and Rob Pelinka start working out potential LA Lakers draft prospects Chris Bosh and Pat Riley bury the hatchet, both moving on peacefully More Sports AFL NRL Rugby Union Cricket Soccer Tennis Motor Sports Basketball NFL Fight Sports More 'Tekken x Street Fighter' may resume development Fitbit wearable specs revealed 'Red Dead Redemption 2' PC compatibility will not be announced soon Facebook denies targeting young Australians, Kiwis based on their emotional state Xbox One and Xbox 360 Deals With Gold until May 9 announced: ‘Street Fighter X Tekken’ and ‘DmC: Definitive Edition’ among the best deals Gaming writer Chet Falizek parts amicably with Valve, ‘Half-Life 3’ future bleaker More Life Environment & Science Health & Wellbeing Gaming Technology Travel & Food Fashion & Beauty Art & Design 'Quantico': Priyanka Chopra talks about season 3 'Winds of Winter' theory: Euron Greyjoy and the Long Night ‘Outlander’ season 3: Diana Gabaldon explains Rollo casting Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip health speculation rife as entire household staff called to ‘emergency meeting’ 'Fast & Furious' is first franchise to receive MTV Generation Award over an individual ‘The 100’ season 4 episode 10 recap: Twist to the Conclave More Entertainment Movies TV Celebrities Music McLaren 570GT Review: Grand, But No Touring Car IBTimes Newsletters Sign up to get the latest headlines delivered to your inbox every morning.

By Corazon Victorino On 05/05/17 AT 10:12 PM Close Apple’s Phil Schiller just shared his honest thoughts about the Amazon Echo and Google Home smart speakers. He also indirectly pointed out what he thinks is lacking in these devices.  Gadgets 360 has finally published its interview with Apple’s Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing when he was in Bengaluru, India last March. When Schiller was asked to comment on the famous smart speakers Amazon Echo and Google Home, he responded that he won’t give specific comments on each device. He then candidly added, “My mother used to have a saying that if you don’t have something nice to say, say nothing at all.” Schiller continued by saying that he’ll just tackle the general concepts. He first pointed out that there is definitely a market for voice-driven assistants that’s why Apple is working so hard in developing and improving Siri. However, he noted that a voice assistant device without a screen is only important at times when it’s convenient to have this type of device. He set two examples to back his statement. First, he said that a device without a screen is perfect for when one is driving. Next, he stated that this technology is also useful for when one is listening to music from a device across the room because there’s the advantage of switching songs without walking over and back to the device. READ: Amazon Prime Video coming to Apple TV this year Schiller stated that there are many other times when a voice assistant device is beneficial, but he thinks that this does not mean such devices should not come with a screen display. For this, he used asking for directions as an example. The Apple executive said that while a voice assistant can say the directions out loud, it would still be better if one can see the directions on a map. “I can see what turns are coming up, and I can see where there is congestion, I understand better my route and what I’m going to do,” he said.  According to Schiller, another aspect where the voice-only assistants fail is photography. Voice assistants could never work with this application because photography requires a screen nowadays. He linked this downside to social media saying, “All the social networking apps… are now embracing photos more and more.” He also said, “The idea of a device without a screen, well it’s not really useful for that whole category of photos that we all share.” Lastly, Schiller tackled the disadvantage of voice-only devices when it comes to gaming. “The biggest category of all of apps is games, and I have yet to see any voice-only games that, for me, are nearly as fun as the one that I play on my screen,” he said. Because of this, he firmly believes that the role of the screen is very important in the tech industry, and it will remain that way.  READ: Apple Pay updated with 21 more U.S. banks While Schiller’s comments are vague, AppleInsider reports that they could be providing insight as to what Apple is planning for its voice assistant technology long-term. At present, the Cupertino giant is rumored to be working on a Siri-based smart speaker that would surely be a direct competitor to the Amazon Echo and Google Home. Details about the device are scarce, but it’s not that hard to imagine that it would feature a display given Schiller’s sentiments.  Phil Schiller gave his honest thoughts on the Amazon Echo and Google Home smart speakers.

This is certainly an excellent question, especially as there are rumors swirling that Apple may not be launching their 10th anniversary iPhone 8 at all this year. This rumor has allegedly come from an analyst at Deutsche Bank who has made public a research note which states that Apple doesn’t feel comfortable releasing the iPhone 8 in 2017 because of “key component shortages and technical challenges,” as the Daily Mail has reported. Business Insider was the first to report on this rumored note of the delayed U.S. release date of the iPhone 8 from the analyst, which originally came from a report by ValueWalk. “As we have written in previous research notes, several supply chain reports have suggested that key component shortages and technical challenges could delay the release of a high-end iPhone 8 device this fall. We believe this report further underscores the uncertainty around the timing of Apple’s next-generation iPhone model.” There are many rumors around the anticipate release date of the new iPhone 8. [Image by Sean Gallup/Getty Images] The rumor is that ValueWalk released insider information from an anonymous source from somewhere within the Foxconn Corporation. This source claims that there won’t be any packaging materials at all for the new iPhone 8 until June, which would certainly not leave a ton of time in the year for Apple to release the iPhone 8. PC Advisor, while also mentioning the Deutsche Bank analyst rumors, have stated that if Apple keeps to their traditional schedule, then the iPhone 8 should have a U.S. release date in September 2017. They do note that there are still rumors about a delay in the iPhone 8 due to the glass OLED screens which may end up pushing the release date for the iPhone back a little later until November. However, a November 2017 U.S. release date for the iPhone 8 would still be preferable to it not being released at all this year. New Apple iPhone 8 possible first look. pic.twitter.com/RNDpyfIFg7 — MVAMAGAZINE (@MVAMAGAZINE) May 3, 2017 While the media and everyone have been calling Apple’s new 2017 phone an iPhone 8, have they definitely settled on a name yet? The rumors are that it could go by other names, such as the iPhone 7s, iPhone X, or even iPhone Edition. As far as the new iPhone 8 design is concerned, there is now a leaked technical drawing of the phone which corroborates other leaks about its camera. Apple appears to be turning the camera assembly so that it will now be vertical, with a 90 degree difference from what it used to be. One of the biggest leaks which seems to get the most news is the rumor that the iPhone 8 will be using OLED technology, similar to Samsung’s Galaxy X7, instead of the older IPS technology. What OLED would do would be to ensure that the iPhone 8 has immensely better colors as well as contrast. While nothing is set in stone regarding the new OLED technology, Apple did allegedly order 70m panels directly from Samsung. It is also rumored that the iPhone 8 will now feature a 5.8 inch display. This would make the screen a little curved, although not as much as the Galaxy S8, of course. Will the new iPhone 8 featured OLED technology? [Image by Cole Bennetts/Getty Images] Another much-touted rumor about the new iPhone 8 is that there will be a touchscreen sensor that users will find embedded into their screens. It is also quite possible that some sort of function area will be placed near the bottom of the screen so that it will be similar to the Touch Bar that Apple users also find on the MacBook Pro. On the other hand, one source from Foxconn has alleged that the Touch ID will actually be placed onto the back of the phone. As far as charging the iPhone 8 goes, reports suggesting that Apple will be using USB-C rather than Lightning to make charging the phone go faster are alleged to be false. It is now thought that Apple is working to make charging faster with a Lightning cable rather than using the previously suggested USB-C. Are you excited for the release of the new iPhone 8, and do you think the U.S. release date will still be this year despite rumors to the contrary?

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Apple Sells $7 Billion in Bonds, Total Debt Now Over $100 Billion That's a lot of paper. Evan Niu, CFA (TMFNewCow) May 5, 2017 at 6:10PM Just a couple months after conducting a bond offering in February, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is back to tap the capital markets once again. The last U.S. offering came in at $10 billion (it raised a modest $1 billion in Taiwan as well), and brought Apple's total debt to nearly $100 billion after including commercial paper, which is a short-term debt instrument often used for working capital purposes. After reporting earnings earlier this week, Apple filed a prospectus for another $7 billion offering. Here's how it priced out. Principal Fixed or Floating Rate Maturity $500 million Floating 3-month LIBOR plus 7 basis points 2020 $750 million Floating 3-month LIBOR plus 35 basis points 2022 $1 billion Fixed 1.8% 2020 $1 billion Fixed 2.3% 2022 $1.75 billion Fixed 2.85% 2024 $2 billion Fixed 3.2% 2027 Data source: Prospectus. While most of Apple's debt carries fixed coupon rates, it typically enters into interest rate swaps to effectively convert those to floaters. At the end of last quarter, Apple had $88.5 billion in term debt. Total debt including commercial paper was $98.5 billion. With this week's offering, total debt including commercial paper is approximately $105.5 billion. Apple Park, the company's new corporate headquarters. Image source: Apple. Wait, where'd all the money from the last offering go? At the end 2016, Apple's domestic cash position was $15.9 billion. At the end of the first quarter (before this most recent offering), that figure was $17.2 billion. So if Apple raised $10 billion in February, where'd all that cash go? Data source: SEC filings. Chart by author. Calendar quarters shown. Share repurchases. Apple bought back roughly $7 billion worth of stock last quarter, consisting of $4 billion in open-market purchases and a fresh $3 billion accelerated share repurchase (ASR) program. ASR programs require a large upfront payment initially, before the investment bank completes the program in subsequent months. That's why Apple's domestic cash only increased by about $1.4 billion sequentially, despite raising $10 billion during the quarter. Bond offerings are becoming more frequent It's worth noting that the frequency of Apple's bond offerings is accelerating, and that trend isn't likely to let up anytime soon. The company now has about $60 billion of remaining authorization on its share repurchase program, but that figure will inevitably get updated in about a year. Meanwhile, domestic cash is at the low end of Apple's comfort level, which is usually around $15 billion. Every time domestic cash dips that low, it boosts it with debt. Over the past two years, Apple has repurchased on average $8.9 billion worth of stock per quarter, and with domestic cash running low, that begs the question of how much debt Apple will need to take out to keep funding the program. Winning favors with Trump? The ideal solution is the frequently discussed topic of repatriating some foreign cash. In the fall of last year, CEO Tim Cook said in a radio interview that Apple was actually already planning on repatriating several billion dollars as early as 2017, and that the company had "provisioned several billion dollars" to cover taxes. But that was before Donald Trump won the presidency, and since then Trump has talked an awful lot about a 10% repatriation tax. (The current repatriation tax rate is still 35%.) You can even see it scribbled on the whiteboard in this picture taken in Steve Bannon's office earlier this week. Separately, Apple just announced a plan to invest $1 billion in a fund intended to promote the creation of domestic manufacturing jobs, which is sure to win some political goodwill with our Tweeter in Chief. That puts Apple in a precarious position, since the uncertainty will lead to inaction. You don't choose to repatriate at 35% if there is a very real possibility of a 10% tax on the horizon. In the meantime, Apple may just need to keep selling paper as it waits for more visibility around the tax environment. Evan Niu, CFA owns shares of Apple.

Vanity Fair hive Sign In/Up business technology politics the players hwd movies television awards reviews vanities celebrity fashion beauty royals NEWSLETTER Video VF Store Magazine Search Business Politics Technology The Players Sign In/Up Car Wars Elon Musk Can’t Stop Throwing Shade at Apple Email Facebook Twitter SIGN UP FOR NEWSLETTER Car Wars Elon Musk Can’t Stop Throwing Shade at Apple The billionaire doesn’t seem to think too highly of Tim Cook’s efforts to develop a self-driving car. by Maya KosoffMay 5, 2017 3:30 pm Email Facebook Twitter By Taylor Hill/Getty Images. Tesla, the electric-car company founded by Elon Musk, may be crushing Detroit and worth nearly $50 billion, but it’s hardly in the same league as Apple, the world’s most valuable public company. Still, that doesn’t mean that Musk is fazed by his bigger tech rival—and he’s decidedly unimpressed by its efforts to develop an autonomous vehicle. “I don't know what they're doing on the car front,” Musk said on an earnings call Wednesday when an investor asked whether he’d consider partnering with Apple on self-driving cars, or whether he sees the company as a competitor. “It's not clear.” But Musk, who admitted he owns an iPhone, did offer up some faint praise. “It's a cool company,” he added. “If you don't make it at Tesla, you go work at Apple. I’m not kidding.” Twitter It’s not the first time Musk has taken a shot at Apple for encroaching on his territory. When he was asked in 2015 about Apple’s rumored plans for an electric car, his response was savage. “They have hired people we’ve fired. We always jokingly call Apple the ‘Tesla Graveyard,’ ” he told German newspaper Handelsblatt. “If you don't make it at Tesla, you go work at Apple. I’m not kidding.” “Did you ever take a look at the Apple Watch?” he asked. “No, seriously: It’s good that Apple is moving and investing in this direction. But cars are very complex compared to phones or smartwatches.” Musk may have reason to be tetchy. While Apple’s secretive self-driving car endeavor, code-named Project Titan, has reportedly been beset by obstacles—including a recent staff shakeup—C.E.O. Tim Cook also has nearly $250 billion in liquid assets at his disposal. That’s enough to buy up a number of its self-driving competitors if it chooses, including Tesla and all of Detroit. Indeed, Apple was previously rumored to be interested in outright purchasing a car company—like McLaren—and even approached Musk about the possibility of scooping up Tesla. (Musk said he wasn’t interested.) Luckily for Tesla, Apple now appears to have other plans. Under the direction of Bob Mansfield, who developed the iPad, the company is currently focusing its efforts on developing driverless car technology, as opposed to an actual driverless car. And Apple appears to be making progress. Last week, after getting clearance from the California Department of Motor Vehicles, Bloomberg spotted an Apple self-driving car in the wild: a white Lexus RX450h S.U.V. decked out with commercially-bought sensors, driving around the streets of Silicon Valley. Tesla, meanwhile, seems set on eventually challenging Apple for the title of world’s most-valuable company. When a Barclays analyst asked Musk on Wednesday’s earnings call about a scenario he had previously outlined in which Tesla could achieve a $700 billion market cap—an amount he noted was in line with Apple’s valuation at the time—Musk gave an eyebrow-raising response. “Well, now I may want to preface this by, of course I could be completely delusional, but I think I see a clear path to that outcome,” he said. “The set of steps necessary to achieve that outcome seems pretty obvious. I am heavily involved in Tesla [getting] incredibly good at the machine that builds the machine, which involves, by the way, a tremendous amount of software.” Some investors seem less sure of Musk than he is of himself: though Tesla is nearing the value of General Motors, it had a loss of $675 million in 2016. By comparison, General Motors reported $9.4 billion in earnings. Hedge-fund manager David Einhorn said Wednesday that Tesla is “reminiscent of the March 2000 dotcom bubble.” Share Email Facebook Twitter Maya KosoffMaya Kosoff writes about tech for VF.com, with a focus on start-ups and venture capital.

Their renewable energy projects will produce over 12 MW of solar power — more than the energy they need for Apple manufacturing — and support Japan’s nationwide efforts to limit its carbon emissions. “These innovative new clean energy investments demonstrate our commitment to doing business responsibly and economically,” said Kyoichi Yamanaka, Managing Director of Ibiden’s Environment Group. “Our products help Apple devices run smarter, and now we’re powering our operations with smarter energy too. We’re pleased to partner with Apple and lead the way in helping Japan meet its clean energy goals.” Apple and its suppliers will be generating over 2.5 billion kilowatt hours per year of clean energy for the manufacturing of Apple products by the end of 2018 — equal to taking over 400,000 cars off the road for a year. Apple has taken significant steps to protect the environment by transitioning from fossil fuels to clean energy. Today, the company is powering 100 percent of its operations in 23 countries, and more than 93 percent of its worldwide operations, with renewable energy.

When you launched an older 32-bit app in iOS 10, it first warned that the app might slow down your device. That was, as far as I could tell, not the case, but it was still disconcerting. With iOS 10.3, however, Apple went further, stating in no uncertain terms that the app would stop working with some future version of iOS. As to when that will be, there’s no telling, but iOS 11 would seem to be likely. The iPhone 5s was the first iPhone with a 64-bit processor, and since it shipped in September 2013, developers have had the option to have their apps run in 64-bit mode. Starting in 2015, Apple has required apps to run in 64-bit mode to receive App Store approval. The practical upshot of Apple’s iOS warnings is that most apps that haven’t been updated since 2015 will likely be rendered inoperable by whatever future version of iOS pulls the plug on 32-bit apps. I can’t imagine that there will be any way to keep running such apps, short of refusing to update to that version of iOS. In iOS 10.3, Apple made it possible to see which of your apps will be affected. Navigate to Settings > General > About > Applications. The number next to Applications is the total number of apps installed, but when you tap Applications to see what’s inside, you see a list of 32-bit apps that have no updates available. Tap any app to see its listing in the App Store, from which you can tap through to the developer’s Web site and theoretically ask if there will be an update. In most cases, the answer will likely be no. To bring that question home to roost, what about the TidBITS News app? The answer is, you guessed it, no, we will not be updating it. Written by Matt Neuburg and last updated in January 2013 for iOS 6, the TidBITS News app simply isn’t used by many people, and most of those who are using it have updated to iOS 10. As you can see in the stats for April 2017, fewer than 50 people per day are using it. It should continue to work in current versions of iOS for now. At its heart, TidBITS News is just an RSS reader dedicated to TidBITS, so you can easily replace it with Apple’s built-in News app. To add TidBITS to your Favorites list in News, search for TidBITS in News and either tap the heart icon next to the appropriate search result, or tap the search result itself and then the heart icon in the upper right corner. From then on, just tap Favorites in the News toolbar and then the TidBITS tile to see all our articles. If you want to add an RSS feed to News but can’t find it with a search from within News, you can use Safari. Navigate to the Web site in question, tap the share icon, and then tap Open in News in the share sheet. Once you’re in News, tap the name at the top of the screen to go to the main article list, and tap the heart button there. You can, of course, use any other RSS reader too, but only TidBITS members get access to the full-text RSS feed for use in other apps. If you are a TidBITS member, access the full-text feed by logging in and clicking the RSS link in the upper left of our Web site.   PDFpen and PDFpenPro 9 add 100+ enhancements to improve your PDF editing experience, with annotations, Tables of Contents, and more export options. For PDF reviewing, editing, signing, redacting and exporting, PDFpen has you covered. <http://smle.us/pdfpen9-tb>   Comments about Apple to Deprecate TidBITS News and Other 32-bit iOS Apps To leave a comment, click Add a Comment and then enter the text, your name, and your email address (which won't be displayed).

Thank you for stepping through the Apple News/RSS alternative, which I'll do today. Farewell, TidBits News app! Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 11:11 Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but Apple's News app should work just fine for you. Reply david cuddy   2017-05-05 13:17 Not if you're in Canada. The iOS News app still isn't available here. Probably because we don't have 'Fake News'. Oddly, the News widget does appear on my Today page, and the -1 Home page. But there's no way to control the sources of the news feeds it uses. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 13:22 Still? Sheesh... sorry about that. Reeder or Feedly should work in that case. Reply Frans Moquette  2017-05-05 18:41 I seem to be one of the 50 also, but also no Apple News app on my iPad. I'm in The Netherlands (aka Holland). I do have Newsify, will that work? Otherwise, back to reading with Safari? Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 19:06 I haven't used Newsify, but from what I see on their product page, yes, it should work. Just get the RSS feed URL from the RSS link in the upper left of our Web site (full text for TidBITS members). Safari's Reader view does a pretty good job too for individual articles. Reply Lewis Butler   2017-05-05 11:20 How it was explained to me is that iOS 10 doesn't load 32 bit libraries until it has to, so running a 32-bit app can easily slow down your entire device depending on how much memory you have and how much you switch apps. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 11:24 Could be, but in practice, I never noticed any change after running such an app on my iPhone 7. Perhaps it had sufficient RAM and CPU power to mask any slowdowns. Reply Martin Stoermer  2017-05-05 11:37 Quite a few paid apps on my phone are marked as being on this scrap heap. Some have new versions available with a new name for new $, which I'm a bit grumpy about. In the case of the free ones it's a bit bit annoying but meh. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 11:41 I totally understand and empathize with the irritation of needing to buy new apps, but you should lay that blame squarely at Apple's feet, since they created a situation where developers have no choice but to chase new sales instead of supporting loyal customers. If developers were allowed to charge for upgrades, there would be financial incentive to keep up with existing apps. Reply Frans Moquette  2017-05-05 19:01 I agree. With non-paid updates/upgrades Apple has done developers a big disservice. But not only developers, users also. When you have to switch to a new app, you cannot acces your data in the old app, unless the data is in a cloud storage or the developer has provided a way to transfer it. If the old app does not work anymore on the new OS, you would loose all your data if you were not able to transfer it before the app stopped working Not a great user experience I would think, for which only Apple is to blame. Reply Christopher Smith  2017-05-05 19:33 While I can certainly understand that developers wish they could charge for upgrades (and why it incentivizes improvements to apps), it seems to me that allowing one's app to languish into obsolescence will definitely inhibit future sales. Reply Frans Moquette  2017-05-06 05:19 I agree with that too. Thing is, all products follow an S-shaped growth curve. Older product will be in the top of that curve with little to no new sales. The effort needed to update an older product often does not warrant the revenue from new sales, if any. Reply JohnB (SciFiOne)   2017-05-05 13:43 I knew Glyder would stop working some day. Oh well. But it will be a while yet since I gave up and now only update software and hardware when I have to. Not as secure, but less expensive and so much easier (except that I make even more offline backups to be safe). Reply Anonymous  2017-05-05 14:55 What I would like to comment on is have an iPhone 4s iPad 4/128 both still running iOS 9.3.5. I have been reluctant to move the iPad to iOS 10, I keep erasing the software update (hanging in storage) because of the tricks Apple keeps trying to make me update the iPad 4. Since I have a fixed income and cannot see sense in a new iPhone 5s or 4SE that are 64bit and I haven't been won over with possibilities iOS 10, and without possible compatibility between devices. So this is what I am wondering? 1.What if I update one but not the other, anyone with insight or expertise foresee problems between iProducts? 2.This is in reference to the below info (under FYI), if I update the iPad to 10, I know I cannot go back is it worth it. Any help? 3.Since this is a sandbox world closing in, is it time to just freeze my technology now before it made useless by having to afford the latest and greatest Apple product (or Microsoft)every 2-5 years? Just an FYI: Also my two Mac Pros are is similar place one a 2006/8 2,1 I upgrade the hardware my self to an 8-core so I frozen myself to 10.9.5 world with (64on32) and the used 2010 5,1 model can run 10.11 or 10.12 which seem to iffy, with all the beta crashing of Sierra I had.. At least I can roll back to my macOS of choice 10.9.5 on a different boot drive of the Mac Pro 5,1. ~Barry Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 16:45 It's hard to make concrete recommendations without knowing all the details, but it sounds like it might make sense to keep iOS 9.3.5 on both your devices, particularly if that matches with your Mac Pros and the equivalent version of iTunes (honestly, I don't know what versions match up offhand). If you start upgrading things piecemeal, you will end up in a situation where something won't talk to something else, but it's hard to predict how that will happen. The main thing to be aware of is that you aren't getting security updates, so you should be extra careful to avoid dodgy parts of the Internet. At some point, some hardware will probably fail and force you to get something new, and that may be the event that encourages upgrading everything to the latest and greatest. Reply David Morrison   2017-05-05 22:14 There is definitely a problem with upgrading iDevices if you connect them to a Mac and the Mac is not running a very recent version of OS X. Basically, older versions of iTunes will not talk to newer versions of IOS. What you get is a dialogue every time you plug in the device telling you this and advising you to upgrade iTunes - very annoying, since newer versions of iTunes will not run on older versions of OS X! So say you are running OS X 10.8 with iTunes 12. Your iDevices are running IOS 9.3.5. This works fine. You then decide to upgrade to IOS 10 on a device. If you try to do it through iTunes, it will say you need to upgrade iTunes - this warning is pretty vague, and does not raise any alarms. Unfortunately, iTunes 12 is the last version that will run on OS X 10.8. So your only option is to upgrade OS X which may not be acceptable. So you upgrade the device to IOS 10 over the Internet directly. Then plug it in to your Mac and get a warning from iTunes that it cannot talk to the device. Oops! No more backups of your device. No copying data files from apps to your Mac. No managing apps on your Mac. What does work is that iPhoto will still transfer photos, and probably Image Capture too. Third party file access apps on the Mac can also access the device. It seems to just be iTunes that does not work. Beware also that if you buy a new iDevice, it will not work with iTunes on your old Mac either. Sadly there is definitely no going back after the upgrade. You are stuck with IOS 10. Reply Derek Roff   2017-05-05 16:23 "The number next to Applications is the total number of apps installed, but when you tap Applications to see what’s inside, you see a list of 32-bit apps that have no updates available. " I'm not seeing exactly what you describe in the article, on my iPad 4 with iOS 10.3.1. When I tap on Applications, I see the number of apps (100), and "inside", I see the text you list about "These apps may slow down your iPad...". No app names appear directly below that. Then I see in grey text "Updates available". Below that are app names, including apps that I upgraded today. I haven't counted, but I think all 100 apps might appear in this group. This includes major apps like App Store, Remote, FaceTime, Google, YouTube, Amazon Prime Video, Dropbox, etc. It doesn't make sense to me that these are all 32-bit applications, but it's likely that some of the apps I have installed are. I haven't been able to guess the ordering system for this list. It isn't alphabetical. It isn't by age, install date, or most recent update. Tapping an arrow next to most apps will take me to the App Store, and show me that no update is available. A few say that the app is not available in the App Store. Below the last app on this list is grey text saying "No Updates Available". There are no apps listed under these words. Can you give us a few more words about this app list, and how to interpret the groupings and ordering? Thanks. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 16:41 My best guess is that it's confused. :-) What I'd try is going to the App Store app, making sure that everything is updated, and then restart the iPhone (hold down both buttons until it restarts). Reply Derek Roff   2017-05-05 17:15 Thanks for your response, Adam. A restart changed nothing for me, and the App Store shows no updates available. I guess I will wait and see what happens with the next iOS upgrade. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 17:17 The other thing you could try is signing out in Settings > iTunes & App Stores. Then sign back in and see if it has figured things out better. Reply Timothy Pearson  2017-05-05 16:22 Reading TidBITS in Apple News doesn't work for me. Following your prescription, I added it to my favorites; but it only shows one article since 3 October 2016, and several unrelated articles about "Tidbits" from other sites. If the iOS app stops working, I guess I will have to use the webpage instead. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 16:47 It sounds like your search hit "Tidbits" as a topic, rather than "TidBITS" as the publication. Try again, and make sure the one you're selecting has our capitalization. Tap it, and make sure it's our content, then tap the heart icon at the top right. Reply brent  2017-05-05 18:18 thanks guys! guess i wasn't the only one to ask, lol. i liked the app, really just to catch specific articles i see noted in FB or tweets. but the apple news will do. irony, i had never used apple news until now. keep up the good work, you are still my "go to" resource. Reply Roland G  2017-05-05 19:28 I'm an iOS developer since 2009. I have updated many apps to support 64bit and it really isn't a big deal. The developers of these apps just need to update their apps to support both 32/64 and all is well. At some point Apple needs to move on with their OS and I fully support that. If you don't want to update to 11, don't update, simple as that. Reply David Morrison   2017-05-05 22:24 I use the app occasionally, when in waiting rooms or travelling, but generally prefer the weekly roundup that arrives by e-mail. That said, I prefer the app's layout to News. News just shows the first few lines of each article to give you an idea of what it is about. This is often not helpful. In the app, there is a paragraph summarising the article, which often meant you did not even have to read the article if it was not of interest - a huge time saver. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-06 18:49 Hmm, I see what you mean — Apple News doesn't provide our blurb, just the first few lines of the article. I don't think there's any way to do that in News with an RSS feed. It might be possible with Apple News Format, but that's a whole 'nother ball of development wax. :-) Reply David Morrison   2017-05-05 22:31 I am having trouble adding the member version of the RSS feed. I logged in with Safari and clicked on RSS feed. It asked me if I wanted to open it in News. I said yes, then it told me the story could not be found. Tidbits does not appear in the favourites list. Going back to repeat this process, when I click on RSS, I get a message from Safari: Cannot open page Safari cannot open the page because the address is invalid. Any ideas? Reply David Morrison   2017-05-05 22:35 I quit News, and started again. Safari asked if I wanted to open the link in News. I said Yes. It showed the list of headlines, then said: Story unavailable. This story is not available in News. Given that I had not touched a story, this is mystifying….. Reply David Morrison   2017-05-05 22:37 Even though Tidbits is not listed in Favourites, the Tidbits news items are still being shown….. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-06 18:35 Can you just add it from the search in News? That's generally easier and will give the same result. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-06 18:50 What's weird is that it's working for me in Safari with no problems. Are you logged into the TidBITS site when you start adding? That might make a difference.

By Emily Bary May 5, 2017 5:35 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Apple commanded a 15.9% share of the global wearables market in the first three months of the year, according to new research. Illustration: Spencer Platt/Getty Images The wearables market keeps growing, but Fitbit’s not reaping the gains. In fact, Apple overtook Fitbit as the top wearables vendor in the first quarter, research firm Strategy Analytics said Thursday. Apple doesn’t disclose sales numbers for Apple Watch, but Strategy Analytics estimates that the company shipped 3.5 million wearables during the quarter. That was good for 15.9% share of global industry shipments, the firm said. More from Barron’s Next Why Smartwatches Probably Can’t Save Fitbit Two Years with the Apple Watch: A Love/Hate Relationship The One Number That Shows Trouble At Verizon On Apple’s earnings call earlier this week, CEO Tim Cook said the watch is “already a big business and [we] believe over time it will be even larger.” Fitbit, meanwhile, fell to third place, behind Chinese company Xiaomi. Fitbit accounted for 13.2% of all wearables shipped globally during the first quarter, down from 24.7% a year ago, according to Strategy Analytics. In its earnings report Wednesday, Fitbit said it sold 3 million devices during the quarter. “Fitbit has lost its wearables leadership to Apple, due to slowing demand for its fitness bands and a late entry to the emerging smartwatch market,” Strategy Analytics director Cliff Raskind said in a press release. “Fitbit’s shipments, revenue, pricing and profit are all shrinking at the moment, and the company has a major fight on its hands to recover this year.” Fitbit declined to comment on the report. The company pioneered and excelled in the basic activity tracking segment but it’s now expanding its focus to more advanced wearables, including a new smartwatch that’s in the works. Big Picture: Apple has taken over the No. 1 spot in the wearables market, according to a new market research report.

According to data by Strategic Analytics on Sunday, LG shipped out 7.3 million smartphones in the first quarter of the year, accounting for a fifth of the world’s biggest handset market.  The market share for LG rose nearly 3 percentage points from a year earlier. The gain follows steady sales of the company’s lower-price models, known as the K series and X series, as well as the previous premium V20 model, according to the researcher. The newest G6 smartphone was not counted in the first-quarter shipments, since the model was launched early April in the US market.  LG’s latest expansion in the US market has widened the market share gap from fourth player ZTE from China, which took 6.7 percent. Apple retained the top spot with a 34.5 percent share, up 2.3 percentage points from the same quarter last year. The iPhone vendor shipped out a total of 12.6 million units for the first three months of the year, the data showed. Samsung Electronics came in second with a 24.6 percent share, but the figure fell nearly 3 percentage points on-year, as it was affected by the recalled Galaxy Note 7 model and delayed launch of the latest Galaxy S8 model. The South Korean tech titan reported 9 million first-quarter shipments. “The V20 model in the US market enjoyed an unsolicited gain from the Galaxy Note 7 recall as American consumers became more sensitive about the safety of their handsets,” said a spokesperson at LG Electronics. LG’s premium V20 smartphone won the MIL-STE-810G certification, known as a US military standard for durability. With the newest flagship G6 smartphone, LG hopes to cement its current position in the American market. The company added a wireless charging feature to G6 devices selling in the US, tailoring to consumer needs there. “It’s been one month since the new model hit the US market, and so far we are hearing positive reactions,” said the LG official said. “Durability and safety will be the focus of US marketing for the G6 smartphone.” LG’s mobile communications business is on a path to restore profitability. The division reported 200 million won ($176,000) in operating losses in the first quarter, reducing drastically by nearly 200 billion won from a year earlier. “The company is forecast to reduce the loss from the smartphone business with the backing of global sales of the G6 smartphone,” said John Ko, an analyst at NH Investment & Securities.

Event Key is a new app that lets people from Roswell and Chaves County stay up to date on what’s going on in town. The app is free and is available for Android and Apple phones. (Submitted Image) There’s a new app in town. For those who aren’t as technologically up to date as they might be, “app” is short for application. An app is nothing more than what used to be called a program. One big difference between apps and programs is that often the software that runs the app is in the cloud, rather than on your machine, but that isn’t always the case. Enrique Moreno, local organizer and businessman, decided that the time had come for Roswell’s people to have one place to go to find out what’s going on in town. “They say there’s an app for everything,” Moreno said. “I found out that there really isn’t. So I decided to jump on this before somebody else did. I’ve had some people on Facebook calling me a dream crusher because they wanted to do an app like this.” Part of his motivation was that he needed help in his profession. “The event calendar helps me as an organizer,” he said. “People throw away flyers, but they won’t throw away their cellphones.” He said he tried to make the app as useful as possible to as many people as possible. “I went to Parks and Recreation Department and they sent me to the city,” Moreno said. “I spoke with them and they have a website where they list [auth] calendars. Parks and Rec has one, and the Civic Center. The city has one, too. I got permission to list their information as long as I don’t make a profit off of them.” He said he will draw clear lines where money is concerned. “I’m not profiting to list information,” he said. “You can download from iTunes and Google Play for free. The only charges for the app are business listings. Nonprofit events are listed free. For-profit events have a way to get listed for free, too, since we’re not trying to make a profit off of the listings. If they promote the app at their event or provide tickets that we can give away to the public, their listing is free.” Moreno said that the app has already made a difference and that he expects it to continue to grow. “If you have the app and you’re looking for something to do on the weekend, it’s right there,” he said. “We’re already using it to promote the next community yard sale. And we’ve had two people already sign up for the yard sale in September, so it’s already having an effect.” He is prepared to list anyone with an event to share, he said. “If anybody sends me a message, we’ll put their events on as long as they are family-friendly,” Moreno said. “The app is certified as ‘E’ for Everyone.” Moreno surprised himself with this project. “I never pictured myself starting an app,” he said. “I hired a company to write the code, to get the event calendar to work, so that you can save an event into your phone’s calendar so it can alert you the day of the event. I did the graphics myself, punched them in and they made it work. I have 24/7 support.” He said the cost was surprising. “It’s a pretty affordable service,” he said. “I’m wanting to see if anybody’s interested in the app process and wants to jump on board and work as a street team. There are a lot of good ideas out there that haven’t been found.” It’s been a growing experience for him. “I learned a lot of things while developing this app,” Moreno said. “Some apps are plug and play, like video games. You have somebody monitor them every so often to make sure there are no glitches. Event Key is not plug and play. I’m monitoring it every day to make sure it’s working as it’s supposed to. I’m reaching out to businesses. If a new event comes and someone doesn’t know about the app, I have to reach out to them and let them know it’s available.” There are two features that make Event Key particularly attractive, he said. “One of the features is if it’s a benefit-type event,” Moreno said, “a nonprofit, it has the ability to push an alert to anybody who has the app. One thing that hasn’t pushed yet but we will be pushing is, yard sales. The yard sale calendar has a feature where, at the bottom, it has a map button and you can use it to plan your route for going to yard sales.” He’s hoping to serve all of Chaves County. “I’m hoping that the people on the outskirts of Roswell, Hagerman and Dexter would download it,” he said, “and see what’s happening in the area, too.” While businesses do pay for advertisements, Moreno stresses that users never pay for any information. “Even though there are business listings,” he said, “this is a free app. All the contents are free to view. The only way this app will work is if people use it. We need people to download and use the app now. I’m not going to push advertising sales. I’m going to push downloads. User downloads are the main thing we’re wanting to push. I monitor it every day. Downloads are constantly going up.” He’s also using lower-tech ways to reach people. “I’m definitely still going old school,” Moreno said. “We’re doing flyers and banners at events. We’re going in person to events and pushing our app. We’ve got event collaborations to push the app and the events together.” Moreno is working to better optimize the app for search engines. “It’s a smaller app,” Moreno said, “being only local and not international, so it goes to the bottom of search engines. We’ll be focusing on Twitter and Instagram soon. Right now, we offer links for businesses that list to send us their Twitter link, so we can push it that way.” Android users can find Event Key on Google Play with a basic search for Event Key, but it requires some scrolling. The easiest way to find the app on iTunes is to Google “event key Roswell app iTunes.” Features reporter Curtis M. Michaels can be reached at 575-622-7710, ext. 205, or at reporter04@rdrnews.com.

LIKE   TWEET   SHARE   PIN   SHARE   POST MAIL MORE Posted 3 hours ago by iClarified · 1281 views · Translate Apple is planning to make changes to the earpiece on the next generation iPhone, according to a new research note from JPMorgan. The iPhone 8 is said to feature an 'enhanced receiver' with 'further improvements' to stereo sound and waterproofing. With the launch of the iPhone 7, the earpiece (receiver) doubles as a speaker giving you stereo sound. Presumably, the new speaker in the iPhone 8 will be louder and could be sufficiently waterproof to meet the IP68 water resistance rating rumored for the new smartphone. JPMorgan also claims that the iPhone 8 could come with AirPods instead of EarPods; however, that's quite unlikely considering there is still a 6 month shipping estimate on the wireless earphones five months after their release. (Or pay a premium on Amazon) Notably, a separate JPMorgan analyst (Rod Hall, USA), claims that Apple could preview the iPhone 8 at WWDC in June. That also seems very unlikely; however, Apple could be looking to get ahead of leaks and prepare developers for a new OS and display size.

But that approach could come with its own risks. Ryan Brooks reports. Video Transcript In China's cutthroat smartphone market- -Apple's making a play to hitch sales onto services- -in everything from digital payment to online games. The move could be crucial money after maker the company posted a dip in first quarter iPhone sales - with revenue in China slipping as local rivals eat into the market. That strategy makes sense given China drove 50% of growth on the App Store last year. But as Reuters' Cate Cadell explains, the new focus comes with some local problems. SOUNDBITE (English) CATE CADELL, REUTERS, SAYING: "It comes with a lot of separate risks which aren't involved in hardware. So there's a lot of things that the Chinese government has been cracking down on in the last year, including livestreaming, including media, including games, and all of these things fit into Apple's new services ecosystem. We can expect that they're going to- come into conflict with regulators on the content side a lot more than compared to just selling straight hardware." As Beijing clamps down online on one side- Experts expect local brands to move aggressively into services, too... To compete, Apple really needs to nail its next iPhone model this fall. SOUNDBITE (English) CATE CADELL, REUTERS, SAYING: "Getting that next phone into the hands of consumers is really really important, not just for selling hardware and making money but for getting a bigger install base for getting more of these services and really bring people into their ecosystems so they can compete with people like WeChat, these large China players that are coming up and building their own ecosystems." In April last year, regulators forced Apple to pull its iBooks and movies from China just weeks after they went live. And the company's gaming apps have had setbacks with new rules that say foreign developers need local partners. Those are hurdles that local brands with cheaper phones won't always need to jump. Making it that much harder to convince Chinese buyers to stay inside that Apple's universe.

Company Summary NSE BSE Pfizer Loading data... ADD TO PORTFOLIO ADD TO WATCHLIST SHARE YOUR OULOOK ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz PEER COMPANIES Over $2.6 trillion is held as untaxed cash in offshore accounts by top US companies like Apple, Google, IBM, Pfizer, Pepsi and Coke, McDonald's etc according to a report by the Washington-based Institute for Tax and Economic Policy (ITEP). This is the highest-ever hoard held offshore by American companies and represents a net tax loss of a staggering $767 billion for the US government. The $2.6 trillion untaxed funds are more than the combined GDP of 153 countries, four times the US defence budget, and slightly more than the total mandatory spending of $2.45 trillion on social security, food security, medicare and unemployment by the US government in 2015. The untaxed treasure hoard is more than India's GDP. According to Richard Phillips of ITEP, this information was dug out from 10-K filings, that is, annual reports filed by companies with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Of the 500 top companies in the US, 322 were found to have large offshore holdings. How is it possible for companies to keep their profits abroad and evade taxes? The answer lies in a well-exploited loophole in the US tax code, says Phillips. "The US tax code has a provision, known as deferral, which allows companies to pay no additional US taxes on their offshore earnings until that money is repatriated.When it is technically repatriated, the companies have to pay the full US tax rate, minus any foreign taxes they have already paid," he told TOI. Eyeing this cash, President Donald Trump has proposed an amnesty scheme under which companies can bring back their offshore wealth by paying a one-time 10% tax. The going rate for corporate taxes in US is 35% and, so, a huge concession is being offered. President George W Bush had granted a similar amnesty in 2004 with a onetime tax rate of 5.25% only. However, it was thought to be a failure with companies hoarding more cash abroad hoping for tax holidays. Phillips thinks the best policy to end this hoarding of cash would be to require companies to pay US tax immediately on their offshore earnings, rather than allowing them to defer these taxes as under current law. Without the incentive of tax avoidance, companies would simply stop hoarding their cash offshore, he said.

Bionic basil. The Open Agriculture Initiative, an MIT Media Lab project to apply technology to food production, revealed results last week from a series of experiments that yielded dramatically more flavoursome basil that can be achieved in normal growing conditions. The plants were grown in an environment where computers controlled an array of factors, from water and salinity levels to light exposure and heat. Each plant produced more than 3m data points that were fed into an artificial intelligence system developed by Sentient Technologies.

Club MacStoriesWeekly Extras MENU ABOUT PODCAST NEWSLETTER ADVERTISE SECTIONS APP REVIEWS IPAD DIARIES STORIES APPLE HISTORY IOS AUTOMATION GAMES Dispelling the Apple Services Myth Prizmo Go Review: Smarter OCR with the iPhone’s Camera App Camp for Girls is Coming to Chicago Phil Schiller on App Store Upgrade Pricing→ Linked By Federico Viticci Gadgets 360's Kunal Dua interviewed Apple's Phil Schiller last month and, among questions about voice-only assistants, he also asked about upgrade pricing on the App Store. Gadgets 360: With all the recent changes in the App Store, can developers expect to see upgrade pricing next? Phil Schiller: The reason we haven’t done it is that it's much more complex than people know, and that's okay, it's our job to think about complex problems, but the App Store has reached so many successful milestones without it because the business model makes sense to customers. And the upgrade model, which I know very well from my days of running many large software programmes, is a model from the shrink-wrapped software days that for some developers is still very important, for most, it’s not really a part of the future we are going. I think for many developers, subscription model is a better way to, go than try to come up with a list of features, and different pricing for upgrade, versus for new customers. I am not saying it doesn't have value for some developers but for most it doesn’t, so that's the challenge. And if you look at the App Store it would take a lot of engineering to do that and so would be at the expense of other features we can deliver. For example, the App Store has one price for an app, when you see it, you see if there's a price on it, that's the price. It doesn't have multiple prices for multiple tiers of customers so to engineer that in, it's not impossible, but a lot of work for a small segment of software that we hope for many of them, subscription pricing is a better model, the one where the customers are comfortable with. So we’ll keep talking to developers about what's most important on their list, we want them to keep telling is if that [upgrade pricing] is high on the list or not, and we’ll keep an open mind to it, but it's harder than people realise. Schiller's point makes sense – rather than retrofitting the App Store for old software pricing systems, Apple has found success with a new, simpler model. It's also true, however, that upgrade pricing has worked successfully for developers that have never sold "shrink-wrapped software" – companies that want to retain their most loyal customers without forcing them to sign up for a subscription. You don't need to sell software on physical discs for upgrade pricing to make sense. It'll be interesting to see how developers – especially on iOS and the iPad (if WWDC brings new incentives to the platform) – will continue to adapt and try different strategies. We've seen some signs of this over the past year, with The Omni Group shifting to In-App Purchases and productivity apps relying on subscriptions, and I hope Apple will add even more flexibility to these new models at WWDC.

The city’s annual Cannabis Parade rolled down Broadway on Saturday — with enthusiasts buzzing that the Big Apple should soon go to pot. Some 200 puffers assembled to march from 32nd Street to Union Square, where activists called for legalization and trumpeted the medical benefits of marijuana. Participants also danced to reggae music and rolled their own in plain sight. The NYPD officially frowns on any reefer madness. But the billowing clouds of acrid pot smoke from parade goers Saturday said otherwise. “They’re human beings. They’re enjoying themselves. That’s all that matters,” said one cop at the march who took the high road. “Thank you NYPD for letting us have our party!” crowed rally speaker Steve Bloom, who runs the marijuana-news website CelebStoner.com. More On: marijuana Disney World bans medical marijuana from Orlando parks De Blasio shows up late for Democratic candidates' forum WWE legend X-Pac arrested for having meth, pot in airport Smuggler tries to hide massive pot stash in casket Along the puffers parade route, participants chanted “Hey hey ho, high prohibition has got to go!” and waved posters reading “Enjoy the breeze, blow trees,” “Peace love and weed,” and “Cannabis therapy reduced opioid deaths.” Steven Phan, 27, owner of a weed-themed clothing line, smoked a blunt with his friends as he enjoyed the mellow afternoon. “I smoke because I enjoy the feeling. It helps me with my ADD. It slows me down, it helps me focus better,” Phan said. “I prefer to do that than take Aderol or another pill. All these different people, from all walks of life come together. We all have a common reason to be here, which is pot. It’s a beautiful thing.” High-rollers passed out “special” cookies and shared a pipe, while others donned weed-related wardrobe. Activist Todd Hinden donned his signature custom made suit emblazoned with marijuana leaves. Anne Armstrong, Reverend of the Healing Church of Rhode Island, anointed the flock with cannabis oils and blew into a horn to kick off the marijuana march. Armstrong said she puffs because it “makes me feel closer to God and more compassionate toward human beings.” One high-light: Several advocates carried a 52-foot-long inflatable joint along the parade route. March organizer Dana Beal said the parade is a tradition that dates back to the 1970s and New York should take its cue from other states where marijuana is now legal. “It’s legal in a lot of places, which means that there is more support for it. We want to replace alcohol and cigarettes with marijuana. It’s much safer. Nobody ever dies from pot. We haven’t seen how far we can go yet. We can go beyond Colorado.” Piped Beal, “There is a stereotype of marijuana smokers as stoners, as boneheads, nothing upstairs, but look at what people are like on alcohol.” Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Filed under cannabis ,  manhattan ,  marijuana ,  parades Share this article: Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Read Next Why schools and religion are proving to be a tricky mix Read Next Why schools and religion are proving to be a tricky mix Share Selection Trending Now on NYPost.com 106,090 Model learns the hard way the internet is forever 34,103 Chris Rock cheated on his wife with Kerry Washington 23,404 The horrible thing you never knew about ducks 18,822 Ellen says Trump is not welcome on her talk show Columnists John Crudele De Blasio's war on cigarettes should focus on smugglers too Jennifer Gould Keil Joe Coffee opening up four new locations SEE ALL COLUMNISTS Now On How the Aretha Franklin and Dionne Warwick feud began ‘Broad City’ stars ‘snapped’ at gala photographers Malcolm X admitted he couldn’t sexually satisfy wife SEE ALL Video Goldie and Kurt immortalized together on the Hollywood Walk of Fame More Stories page six Chris Rock cheated on his wife with Kerry Washington Now On Decider 10 Movies Where The Actors Had Real Sex On Camera nypost Model learns the hard way the internet is forever New York Post Facebook Twitter Instagram LinkedIn Email Email Newsletters Mobile Apps Contact Us Tips Facebook Twitter Instagram LinkedIn Email Sections & Features News Real Estate Page Six Tech Sports Media Metro Photos Entertainment Video Business Alexa Opinion Covers Fashion Horoscopes Living Classifieds Newsletters & Feeds Email Newsletters RSS Feeds NYPost Store Home Delivery Subscribe Manage Subscription Preferences Help/Support Customer Service App FAQ & Help Contact Us Tips Newsroom Letters to the Editor Reprints Careers Apps iPhone App iPad App Android Phone Android Tablet Advertise Media Kit Contact Post Digital Network © 2017 NYP Holdings, Inc.

For those unfamiliar, the receiver is the slim, meshed earpiece cutout above the screen that you hold against your ear during a phone call. Since the iPhone 7, it has doubled as a full-out speaker. With two speakers, Apple says the iPhone 7 delivers two times the audio output of an iPhone 6s with increased dynamic range. JPMorgan didn't specify what acoustical improvements will be made to the iPhone 8's receiver, but it's reasonable to assume it could have higher peak volume at the very least. The earpiece will also be more waterproof, in line with a previous rumor claiming the iPhone 8 will have even better IP68-rated water resistance. The research note also made the rather outlandish prediction that AirPods may come as a free accessory with the iPhone 8. Apple including AirPods with the iPhone 8 isn't something we've heard before, so treat the rumor with a healthy dose of skepticism. But, if the rumor proves to be accurate, AirPods would presumably replace Apple's wired EarPods with Lightning connector that it includes in the box with current iPhone models. AirPods cost $159 in the United States, considerably more than EarPods, which retail for $29 when purchased separately, and cost Apple barely anything to make, according to estimates by market research firm IHS Markit. It's unclear how much it costs Apple to manufacture a pair of AirPods. Multiple reports suggest the iPhone 8 will be expensive, with the base model costing at least as much as a maxed out iPhone 7 Plus. Given that many iPhone 8 configurations will likely exceed $1,000 in the United States, perhaps Apple will still be able to achieve a reasonable enough profit margin to include AirPods in the box. Other iPhone 8 features expected by JPMorgan have all been rumored previously, including a stainless steel and glass design, faster processor, larger battery, wireless charging, and 3D sensing module for facial recognition. JPMorgan estimates the device will be $75 to $80 more expensive to manufacture. This research note comes from a group of JPMorgan analysts in the Asia-Pacific region, including Gokul Hariharan. Not listed is Rod Hall, who covers Apple for JPMorgan in the United States. Hall is the analyst who believes there's a highly likely chance Apple will preview the iPhone 8 at WWDC in June.

Maybe not. If Apple does charge more than $1000 for the coming iPhone, will Wall Street still expect those tens of millions of iPhone purchasers to upgrade to a newer iPhone the following year? And if they don't, will analysts still claim it's due to Apple being unable to innovate? Why doesn't the same logic apply to toasters and microwave ovens? Use them a year and then upgrade to new ones. I honestly don't know when this requirement to upgrade products on a yearly basis started. When I was growing up 50 some odd years ago, I'm sure products tended to last a lot longer (many years) and we were quite happy to have a product last a long time. Why has that attitude changed so much? One would think with so much talk about dwindling resources consumers would be a lot smarter than to simply stop using perfectly working products just to buy slightly newer ones. I really don't understand this type of behavior.

I think you're wrong now and every time in the past. It'll come in time, but one year after the release of AirPods, which are considerably more expensive than EarPods and constantly out of stock, just doesn't make sense for apple.

Opinion: Even if you can, you probably shouldn't buy a Google Pixel anymore David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/05/01 2:09pm PDTMay 1, 2017 103 Plus 1 on G+ 370 Share on Facebook 104 Share on Twitter Total Shares577 Editorials Pixel Pixel XL The Google Pixel is a notoriously hard phone to get a hold of. Persistent stock issues have plagued Google's first "in-house" handset from day one, and things really are little to no better six months after the launch event. Honestly, it's a bit embarrassing just how consistently incompetent Google seems to be at keeping a reasonable inventory of phones available for purchase. But setting that aside, as one of the Pixel's most ardent evangelists, I think there's something it's probably time for me to come clean on: Even if you could buy a Pixel today, I really think you shouldn't. The Pixel is a product with generation-one product issues. The Bluetooth performance is horrid. It's not waterproof. The bezels really are due for a shrink. I don't think the exterior coating on the black and blue variants is of a particularly high quality. The glass window gets scuffed up incredibly easily. The Snapdragon 821 is officially old news. And it doesn't support proper advanced network features across all four of the big US carriers. There are other flaws I could point to, and while none of them are too terrible, they do speak to the slightly-rushed development cycle this phone seems to have been subjected to. Sure, Google got some things astoundingly right: the performance, the camera, the larger software experience. In fact, I think the Pixel is easily the best Android smartphone ever for these strengths, at least if we're talking about me personally as a user (your mileage, obviously, may vary). But for all the great, smooth, fast, clean, pure, simple, natural, and various other adjective-members singing in the Pixel-praise cavalcade, this phone is not the one to buy right now. For starters, Google continues to ask what is an increasingly laughable amount of money for the model most of us want - the 128GB XL - at a staggering $870. Sure, Apple charges the same for an iPhone 7 Plus 128GB, but I'm under no illusion that this comparison in any way favors Google. The iPhone comes with Apple customer service (with actual stores), a longer software support period going forward, and runs no real risk of poor resale value. The Pixel? Google's online support is iffy at best, we know the phone will be unsupported by October 2018, and I have a strong feeling generation-one Pixel resale values will drop like a rock once the new phones are announced. And that really is why, if you haven't pulled the trigger on a Pixel yet, you should just wait. It's overpriced, under-supported, and competing phones like the Galaxy S8 offer a whole lot more technology for your money. The Galaxy S8+ is $20 less than a 128GB Pixel XL, and I would argue it is far and away the better smartphone value. That amazing display, brand-new Snapdragon 835 processor, jaw-dropping design and packaging, and the full support of all our American carriers' latest LTE advancements could each be a reason on its own to put the Galaxy S8 above Google's smartphone. Do I still prefer using the Pixel over the S8? Sure. But I wouldn't buy a 128GB Pixel XL over a Galaxy S8+ today. That would be, frankly, a bit silly. If Google was asking $670 and not $870, the discussion would probably change, but they aren't. You've got to pay full price, and there's no way I could recommend anyone do that. If you're still on the fence about the Pixel, let me try to push you over: wait for the next generation. I realize that this sort of thinking can devolve into a rationale that encourages you to never upgrade anything because something newer, faster, and better is constantly on the horizon. But in this case, I think it's a consideration that is worth weighing more seriously than usual. Many of the Pixel's biggest flaws relate to Google's inexperience producing a smartphone. Issues that only come up as you try to mass-produce and distribute a product with a real marketing campaign that creates real demand, and the phone gets into the hands of "real" users who aren't part of the now-derailed Nexus phone hypetrain. Inside Google, expectations were no doubt managed, realities realized, and priorities accordingly re-calibrated after this first launch. (Side note: if the Bluetooth performance on the next Pixel is as bad as the first one, I may scream, Google.) Meanwhile, the things that make the Pixel great aren't going anywhere. The next Pixel will be fast, it will take great photos, and it will offer a wonderfully unfettered Android experience. Those that make it less than great? Google is no doubt drilling down through the worst of them in order to ensure the Pixel 2 - or whatever it's called - won't make the same mistakes that the original did (waterproofing, please). And one of the primary reasons to try the Pixel in the first place - to be on the very bleeding edge - really only remains true from a software standpoint. Older phones like the Nexus 5X and 6P don't even let the Pixel have an advantage there, as they're on the same update track until around the time the next Pixel phones launch. If you absolutely need a smartphone soon and the Pixel is tempting you, ask yourself this: Can you deal with a Moto G5 Plus for six months if it means having a better Pixel down the road? While as a reviewer I have the admitted luxury of not needing to consider such things, were I in such a position, I'd have little in the way of a counterargument to offer. Sure, you'll take a resale hit on anything you buy now, but the Pixel is going to face a much, much steeper devaluation curve in that time than any budget phone. Buying a Pixel right now just doesn't make sense. I love my Pixel XL, but I'm officially done recommending the phone to friends and relatives. Instead, I'll tell them to wait, or to get the Galaxy S8 they were probably going to buy anyway. Tags editorial google pixel google pixel xl opinion pixel xl subscribe ...

What's wrong with it? I haven't really noticed issues on my 128 non XL. I still love my phone but I understand if someone was switching now, they should just wait for the new one. I probably will. Patruns The XL is too large for me. No wireless charging is a game stopper for me. $650+ is just too much to pay as I buy my phones outright for my wife and myself. We are still happily using our Nexus 5 phones until something of roughly the same dimensions with QI charging comes out that won't break the bank. Also, I want pure Android. Not interested in Touchwiz or any other skins. Rod So, I found another proud N5 owner! I'm in my third battery, nothing to complain about. YuCMi I skipped this generation, was too salty about Google's treatment of Nexus devices. If they make their next phone reasonably priced, then I'll consider it. Otherwise, Google can fuck off with their "premium" pricing. CW The OnePlus 3T is a great phone at a great price! Laura J. Sellers Hughes I bought my Google Pixel XL for the camera. I have not been disappointed! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/c44fd1bc546c27c02f945b075e0388e076c62e0fd612b3c74442129a05446139.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/c4618b9d22a1d44186f347c184038b3a833f38a1148cc4b91b95981303fa8b6b.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/465d23a781688e73e20a0737904c3880ee693ee06b5dd1779ae91d9799b0488b.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/1f3d76182fdd59b34eda695d20943d03e71240b775f63106ef41809601a7cabf.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/66175dfb8d6503940dc945b8d865f4f8276c84f7f3abd0e0e46dc31136501275.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/f7fa8ed860bc28a3a3e377a7e74591e764bdec5795747c4a1afb93eaa44aa0b2.jpg Rod You shouldn't. It's the best camera in a smartphone currently. Even the S8 was left behind in image quality. Aj Wayans Nothing wrong with my Pixel, best phone I've ever had. Only has scratches because I've dropped it a few times Rod Impossible. Pixel is horrid, every single owner has an urge to throw it onto the nearest wall. WNDRKND I hear ya, but I got pixel for Christmas. And back then, there was no new Samsung phone. Personally, the optimization alone makes the phone worth it... Like, I've literally had no problems. Even the speaker issue, Bluetooth, whatever. My handset works perfect, even for a first generation device. Either way, I'll be waiting for pixel three and skipping pixel 2 this Christmas. Rod I think you're 4 months late. Lol WNDRKND Haha perhaps, but with nobody able to get one... I still feel 9 months early lmao! Rod First rule of the Pixel club: no one talks about the club Hussain Ahmadi Pixel is an indie phone, like indie films with limited screens and very much less public appeal, no matter how good it is it will always be just a side phone. The only true big sharks in the market are Samsung and Apple. Google is not able to compete with them erikz The main reason I wanted the Pixel was to get on Google Fi. ackthbbft I think there are still good reasons to go with the Pixel, even if it means waiting for gen 2. I went with the Pixel because I wanted to get on Project Fi and "pure" Android. As a former Samsung Galaxy S5 user (S2 before that), I got tired of both carrier-installed and OEM bloatware, plus I've been saving money on my plan. Tj Hariharan Frankly I'm considering an LG-G6... comes with assistant, near stock android from what I've been told and my little experience with in-store demo's...AND iirc: an SD Card. Rod Then, when Google drops Android 8, you'll infuriated asking LG where your OTA is. gparmar76 Google will charge the same price with Pixel 2. They have a proven track record with the Nexus phones... roseglace >The Bluetooth performance is horrid. so? bluetooth is not everything to everyone. in particular, i've used it on my pixel exactly once. a non-issue. > It's not waterproof. i'll remember not to take my phone into the shower. another non-issue. > The bezels really are due for a shrink. the bezels i can't see with the phone in its case? > I don't think the exterior coating on the black and blue variants is of a >particularly high quality. the coating i can't see with the phone in its case? > The glass window gets scuffed up incredibly easily. there's that case in the way again. darn. > And it doesn't support proper advanced network features across all four >of the big US carriers. such as? maybe i'd worry if i lived in the united states but i bought the phone for phone calls, SMS and wifi. are those 'advanced'? they work in canada. > the model most of us want - the 128GB XL is there a shred of evidence that 'most' of 'us' want it? if it was the exact same price as the 16GB version i'd want it. if it was even twenty bucks more? umm, probably not. i know it's labelled 'opinion' and everything, but could you try a _little_ harder not to sound like you're whining? John Pitkethly I got a Pixel in December and have none of the problems listed in this article. Jordan Bartholme Great article, thank you! thereasoner If fast updates and performance are your thing than it's never a bad time to buy a Pixel but if one must wait then I guess the Pixel 2 is not that far off. Don't care about stock Android performance and updates? Then there are more choices coming still besides Samsung. I personally am looking forward to the HTC U 11 in a couple of weeks time. geolemon Good points. Even still, the worst point is that it's a metal (stupid) and glass (downright silly) wannabe iPhone (including all the hardware limitations we all hate Apple for) to try to pull the "Apple demographic" stereotype as a customer - people who want a jewelry phone rather than a functional, practical tool. Sadly, few alternatives exist today, if you want high end specs. How far we've fallen in just a few years. Hopefully it's something to just ride out - high end phones that fit in front trouser pockets and have swappable batteries, sd cards, and the durability of polycarbonate replacing the impact vulnerability of metal will reappear. But certainly - the Pixel is one of the more vulgar offerings. Sad, because I was otherwise a satisfied customer on Google Fi. Mike Dealbreaker on the Pixel 2 could be whether or not Google include unlimited full resolution Photos & Video BackUp like they have with the Pixel 1. If they don't & just throw in something like the S8's increased 100K Play Music songs limit instead, we just might hold on to our Pixel XL 128 a little longer instead. Like all hardware, it's what you do with it that really matters, but without the software to achieve it with... You just pays your money & you takes your choice. Notpoliticalyet Mate 9 is my Pixel XL. Easy to get one and top end specs. I have had all the Nexus phones and passed up the Pixel. I may look at the 2nd generation but they need to fix their supply chain. No reason to wait long with all of the good competition out there. They also created hype with limited availability. Get it right Google. Kimwo Good read! I've HATED my Pixel from day one! I tried to fall in love with it but I haven't! My husband made me do an upgrade and of course it was when this dumb a*$ ph came out! I sent my Samsung GalaxyS5 in as was required for rebate to get the Pixel. The camera sucks butt, I don't know what all the hype was about! I thought I'd like the fact it has unlimited storage but how is that useful if you can't get a good quality photo!!!! I think Androids are way better, and easy to use. That's all I've had sense the iPhone 4! Wouldn't go back to an iPhone but would take it over a Pixel any day!!😝 Christopher Hopkins First off who ever made this post is just a glorified iPhone fan and downing the Google pixel I've had mine since launch and so have the 3 others on my account and all of us can say nothing has gone wrong with my pixel not once so get off your high horse and the back glass part of my phone is not scratched still and this is the same phone since launch same with my GF her brother and my best friend on my account Stanced Imports What a joke review I've had a Google pixel since January this phone is the best phone I've ever had, and I've had a iPhone 7😂 if you can't afford it that's not a reason to not buy it, that's a choice the consumer should make not a reflection on the phones performance 😁 I live in Canada so my Google pixel is about 1000$ and it's worth every penny Stanced Imports Also I find it's nice that the phones availability is scarce so I don't look at everyone and they all have the same phone. vitriolix "unsupported by October 2018" That's wrong, they will still get security patches until Oct 2019.

The Pixel is a product with generation-one product issues. The Bluetooth performance is horrid. It's not waterproof. The bezels really are due for a shrink. I don't think the exterior coating on the black and blue variants is of a particularly high quality. The glass window gets scuffed up incredibly easily. The Snapdragon 821 is officially old news. And it doesn't support proper advanced network features across all four of the big US carriers. There are other flaws I could point to, and while none of them are too terrible, they do speak to the slightly-rushed development cycle this phone seems to have been subjected to. Sure, Google got some things astoundingly right: the performance, the camera, the larger software experience. In fact, I think the Pixel is easily the best Android smartphone ever for these strengths, at least if we're talking about me personally as a user (your mileage, obviously, may vary). But for all the great, smooth, fast, clean, pure, simple, natural, and various other adjective-members singing in the Pixel-praise cavalcade, this phone is not the one to buy right now. For starters, Google continues to ask what is an increasingly laughable amount of money for the model most of us want - the 128GB XL - at a staggering $870. Sure, Apple charges the same for an iPhone 7 Plus 128GB, but I'm under no illusion that this comparison in any way favors Google. The iPhone comes with Apple customer service (with actual stores), a longer software support period going forward, and runs no real risk of poor resale value. The Pixel? Google's online support is iffy at best, we know the phone will be unsupported by October 2018, and I have a strong feeling generation-one Pixel resale values will drop like a rock once the new phones are announced. And that really is why, if you haven't pulled the trigger on a Pixel yet, you should just wait. It's overpriced, under-supported, and competing phones like the Galaxy S8 offer a whole lot more technology for your money. The Galaxy S8+ is $20 less than a 128GB Pixel XL, and I would argue it is far and away the better smartphone value. That amazing display, brand-new Snapdragon 835 processor, jaw-dropping design and packaging, and the full support of all our American carriers' latest LTE advancements could each be a reason on its own to put the Galaxy S8 above Google's smartphone. Do I still prefer using the Pixel over the S8? Sure. But I wouldn't buy a 128GB Pixel XL over a Galaxy S8+ today. That would be, frankly, a bit silly. If Google was asking $670 and not $870, the discussion would probably change, but they aren't. You've got to pay full price, and there's no way I could recommend anyone do that. If you're still on the fence about the Pixel, let me try to push you over: wait for the next generation. I realize that this sort of thinking can devolve into a rationale that encourages you to never upgrade anything because something newer, faster, and better is constantly on the horizon. But in this case, I think it's a consideration that is worth weighing more seriously than usual. Many of the Pixel's biggest flaws relate to Google's inexperience producing a smartphone. Issues that only come up as you try to mass-produce and distribute a product with a real marketing campaign that creates real demand, and the phone gets into the hands of "real" users who aren't part of the now-derailed Nexus phone hypetrain. Inside Google, expectations were no doubt managed, realities realized, and priorities accordingly re-calibrated after this first launch. (Side note: if the Bluetooth performance on the next Pixel is as bad as the first one, I may scream, Google.) Meanwhile, the things that make the Pixel great aren't going anywhere. The next Pixel will be fast, it will take great photos, and it will offer a wonderfully unfettered Android experience. Those that make it less than great? Google is no doubt drilling down through the worst of them in order to ensure the Pixel 2 - or whatever it's called - won't make the same mistakes that the original did (waterproofing, please). And one of the primary reasons to try the Pixel in the first place - to be on the very bleeding edge - really only remains true from a software standpoint. Older phones like the Nexus 5X and 6P don't even let the Pixel have an advantage there, as they're on the same update track until around the time the next Pixel phones launch. If you absolutely need a smartphone soon and the Pixel is tempting you, ask yourself this: Can you deal with a Moto G5 Plus for six months if it means having a better Pixel down the road? While as a reviewer I have the admitted luxury of not needing to consider such things, were I in such a position, I'd have little in the way of a counterargument to offer. Sure, you'll take a resale hit on anything you buy now, but the Pixel is going to face a much, much steeper devaluation curve in that time than any budget phone. Buying a Pixel right now just doesn't make sense. I love my Pixel XL, but I'm officially done recommending the phone to friends and relatives. Instead, I'll tell them to wait, or to get the Galaxy S8 they were probably going to buy anyway. Tags editorial google pixel google pixel xl opinion pixel xl subscribe ...

What's wrong with it? I haven't really noticed issues on my 128 non XL. I still love my phone but I understand if someone was switching now, they should just wait for the new one. I probably will. Patruns The XL is too large for me. No wireless charging is a game stopper for me. $650+ is just too much to pay as I buy my phones outright for my wife and myself. We are still happily using our Nexus 5 phones until something of roughly the same dimensions with QI charging comes out that won't break the bank. Also, I want pure Android. Not interested in Touchwiz or any other skins. Rod So, I found another proud N5 owner! I'm in my third battery, nothing to complain about. YuCMi I skipped this generation, was too salty about Google's treatment of Nexus devices. If they make their next phone reasonably priced, then I'll consider it. Otherwise, Google can fuck off with their "premium" pricing. CW The OnePlus 3T is a great phone at a great price! Laura J. Sellers Hughes I bought my Google Pixel XL for the camera.

It's the best camera in a smartphone currently. Even the S8 was left behind in image quality. Aj Wayans Nothing wrong with my Pixel, best phone I've ever had. Only has scratches because I've dropped it a few times Rod Impossible. Pixel is horrid, every single owner has an urge to throw it onto the nearest wall. WNDRKND I hear ya, but I got pixel for Christmas. And back then, there was no new Samsung phone. Personally, the optimization alone makes the phone worth it... Like, I've literally had no problems. Even the speaker issue, Bluetooth, whatever. My handset works perfect, even for a first generation device. Either way, I'll be waiting for pixel three and skipping pixel 2 this Christmas. Rod I think you're 4 months late. Lol WNDRKND Haha perhaps, but with nobody able to get one... I still feel 9 months early lmao! Rod First rule of the Pixel club: no one talks about the club Hussain Ahmadi Pixel is an indie phone, like indie films with limited screens and very much less public appeal, no matter how good it is it will always be just a side phone. The only true big sharks in the market are Samsung and Apple. Google is not able to compete with them erikz The main reason I wanted the Pixel was to get on Google Fi. ackthbbft I think there are still good reasons to go with the Pixel, even if it means waiting for gen 2. I went with the Pixel because I wanted to get on Project Fi and "pure" Android. As a former Samsung Galaxy S5 user (S2 before that), I got tired of both carrier-installed and OEM bloatware, plus I've been saving money on my plan. Tj Hariharan Frankly I'm considering an LG-G6... comes with assistant, near stock android from what I've been told and my little experience with in-store demo's...AND iirc: an SD Card. Rod Then, when Google drops Android 8, you'll infuriated asking LG where your OTA is. gparmar76 Google will charge the same price with Pixel 2.

John Pitkethly I got a Pixel in December and have none of the problems listed in this article. Jordan Bartholme Great article, thank you! thereasoner If fast updates and performance are your thing than it's never a bad time to buy a Pixel but if one must wait then I guess the Pixel 2 is not that far off. Don't care about stock Android performance and updates? Then there are more choices coming still besides Samsung. I personally am looking forward to the HTC U 11 in a couple of weeks time. geolemon Good points. Even still, the worst point is that it's a metal (stupid) and glass (downright silly) wannabe iPhone (including all the hardware limitations we all hate Apple for) to try to pull the "Apple demographic" stereotype as a customer - people who want a jewelry phone rather than a functional, practical tool. Sadly, few alternatives exist today, if you want high end specs. How far we've fallen in just a few years. Hopefully it's something to just ride out - high end phones that fit in front trouser pockets and have swappable batteries, sd cards, and the durability of polycarbonate replacing the impact vulnerability of metal will reappear. But certainly - the Pixel is one of the more vulgar offerings. Sad, because I was otherwise a satisfied customer on Google Fi. Mike Dealbreaker on the Pixel 2 could be whether or not Google include unlimited full resolution Photos & Video BackUp like they have with the Pixel 1. If they don't & just throw in something like the S8's increased 100K Play Music songs limit instead, we just might hold on to our Pixel XL 128 a little longer instead. Like all hardware, it's what you do with it that really matters, but without the software to achieve it with... You just pays your money & you takes your choice. Notpoliticalyet Mate 9 is my Pixel XL. Easy to get one and top end specs. I have had all the Nexus phones and passed up the Pixel. I may look at the 2nd generation but they need to fix their supply chain. No reason to wait long with all of the good competition out there. They also created hype with limited availability. Get it right Google. Kimwo Good read! I've HATED my Pixel from day one! I tried to fall in love with it but I haven't! My husband made me do an upgrade and of course it was when this dumb a*$ ph came out! I sent my Samsung GalaxyS5 in as was required for rebate to get the Pixel. The camera sucks butt, I don't know what all the hype was about! I thought I'd like the fact it has unlimited storage but how is that useful if you can't get a good quality photo!!!! I think Androids are way better, and easy to use. That's all I've had sense the iPhone 4! Wouldn't go back to an iPhone but would take it over a Pixel any day!!😝 Christopher Hopkins First off who ever made this post is just a glorified iPhone fan and downing the Google pixel I've had mine since launch and so have the 3 others on my account and all of us can say nothing has gone wrong with my pixel not once so get off your high horse and the back glass part of my phone is not scratched still and this is the same phone since launch same with my GF her brother and my best friend on my account Stanced Imports What a joke review I've had a Google pixel since January this phone is the best phone I've ever had, and I've had a iPhone 7😂 if you can't afford it that's not a reason to not buy it, that's a choice the consumer should make not a reflection on the phones performance 😁 I live in Canada so my Google pixel is about 1000$ and it's worth every penny Stanced Imports Also I find it's nice that the phones availability is scarce so I don't look at everyone and they all have the same phone. vitriolix "unsupported by October 2018" That's wrong, they will still get security patches until Oct 2019.

If you care to go online and dig out campaign spending reports you will find that Liberty Utilities, which is controlled by a global investment company, paid Mr. Husing’s Redlands company $50,000 for this “unbiased study." Liberty fed him the numbers to use and, low and behold, he got the outcomes they wanted. Their campaign spending is all public record. How they will recoup those costs from your water rates is less transparent. TV ads, mailers, Facebook ads, social media posts and fake “real life videos” are all a part of their plan. Don’t believe a word of it. Their big money is corrupting everything and everyone it touches. Can your vote be purchased? If the answer is no, strike a blow for water freedom and vote Yes on Measure F on June 6. Richard Cambridge Apple Valley Choosing colors I read news reports that the protesters in some of the May Day marches were “dressed mostly in red.” I have to wonder if that makes them feel a bit schizophrenic, at least subconsciously. During the Cold War, the color red was associated with communists: “Red China,” “Red Scare,” etc. Then, a few election cycles ago, networks began showing Republican states in red, Democrat states in blue. I wondered at the time if that were a subliminal suggestion that Democrats are the “true blue patriots” and Republicans the “Red Menace,” especially since the color blue is widely associated with conservative parties and red with left-wing ideologies (Wikipedia.com, “Political Colour”). Now I also wonder: Were the protesters wearing Republican Red or Communist Red? Charles L. Smith Apple Valley Trump goes after land grab by enviros The enviros and progressives in America, along with many of the news media as well, had articles ready to go, within hours, of President Trump’s administration announcing that the land grab that the enviros and progressives have made through presidential executive orders, has to be pushed back, scaled back, and in many cases rescinded. Paragraph after paragraph like this “…“Someone donates to a congressman, and all of a sudden a mining company from Canada, or Mitsubishi from Japan, trumps the American people,” Myers said. “The people love these monuments, and they will show up and turn out to protect them.”….make these articles so one-sided that no normal American taxpayer/voter should swallow this drivel. We all want our public lands to be available for all uses, from development of natural resources, the development of communities, left open for recreation and other uses, and in some specific areas, protected because of unique circumstances. But the enviros, who have funded these politicians to a fair-the-well with huge sums of money, are not even mentioned by the writer of this article. But he mentions Mitsubishi Cement, a huge employer and property taxpayer in the USA. An Indian burial ground in a small canyon in Utah doesn’t require hundreds of thousands of acres to be locked up. It is a stupid policy. The BLM or Forest Service could keep windmills off the Banning Pass and critters could scurry across from one range to another, just as the Pacific Crest Trail hikers do presently. This all smells and as we all want our unique lands to be held in the public trusts as parks and national monuments, our national forests. We also should be working diligently to move the rest of America into local or private ownership, as the property warrants. The eastern USA is wonderful with all its private lands and the western USA could be the same. When Clinton locked up a good part of Southern Utah, he locked up huge areas of unique coal that would be providing us with fantastically inexpensive power for America. The natural beauty and accessibility of those sites would not have been impeded by mineral development, but Clinton locked it up anyway. Tom Pinard Wrightwood The real costs Re: "Shame On Us," (4/24/17) ... The contributor of this letter faults the calculation of the total (potential) cost of the Town Of Apple Valley’s purchase of Liberty Utilities by adding the $150 million purchase price plus 30 years interest at 12 percent, implying that the interest costs are not relevant. These numbers are exactly as defined in Measure F. To base your decision on a purchase price of $150 million, without regard to the cost of money ($540 million) is misleading and naive in that the cost of money in this Measure is more that three times the defined purchase price. The contributor's comment “That’s just not the way we think about loans and financial obligations” in my opinion, offers a perfect example of why we as a society experience so many bankruptcies and foreclosures. The total of the principal and interest (as well as the term and interest rate) are the key elements determining your periodic and total payments and indeed, the affordability of the transaction. If you vote in favor of Measure F you are authorizing the town to pay (not to exceed) $690 million for the assets of Liberty Utilities. The debt service alone could well exceed $20 million annually. Anyone who believes the Town staff can save that much money by taking over the assets of Liberty Utilities must have access to far more data than has been revealed to the general public. Dean Schepis Apple Valley Presumptive 'presumptive arrogance' I'm witnessing the beginnings of what I see as call for censorship in of all places, the Opinions section. These people want their opinions heard, but in the name of equality, want those opinions with which they disagree to be reduced. They accuse the newspaper of publishing more views on the opposite side of their political (why don't you publish more anti-Trump cartoons), or religious (why don't you publish less Christian and more anti-Christian stuff) spectrum, while implying that the newspaper is actively involved in not publishing the views of their side. Two things they forget: 1) This is an Opinion section. People are allowed their opinions...not only them. Maybe they're the only ones introducing their side of input to those who publish the opinions? You don't try to shut people up just because you're the minority of a perspective and you don't want to be reminded that your opinion is in the minority. 2) If this newspaper is so biased then why was your critique published? I can hear the counter-argument, "They publish it in an attempt to deceive the public that they have some resemblence of fairness." Isn't that a little "presumptive arrogance" on your part? I, for one, enjoy the differing opinions, even if I don't agree with them, or they me. People are allowed to have diferent opinions than yours, or mine. If you don't like feeling like you're in the minority, then get some of your like-minded friends to join in. Don't try to shut others down to soothe your ego.

One Citi analyst is suggesting exactly that, and a whole lot more. facebook twitter google+ email reddit linkedin pinterest License License Jeremy Korzeniewski Citigroup listed seven companies as potential takeover targets for Apple Inc, including Tesla, Netflix, and Walt Disney, as a way to put its cash hoard of more than $250 billion to work. With over 90 percent of its cash sitting overseas, a one-time 10-percent repatriation tax would give Apple $220 billion for acquisitions or buybacks, Citigroup analyst Jim Suva said in a note to clients. US President Donald Trump's tax blueprint, which was unveiled last month, proposes allowing multinationals to bring in overseas profits at a tax rate of 10 percent versus 35 percent now. "Since one of the new administration's top priorities is to allow US companies to repatriate overseas cash at a lower tax rate, Apple may have a more acute need to put this cash to use," Suva said. Tesla made headlines last month for its massive market cap of about $51 billion. At the time, that meant Tesla was worth $1.7 billion more than its General Motors, America's biggest automaker. Wall Street's valuation of Tesla is based mostly on potential, not on the products and services it has, so far, delivered to customers. Apple has shown clear intentions to enter the automotive segment, with a secretive group of engineers working under the Project Titan label. Apple was recently granted a permit to begin testing self-driving automobiles in California. Other potential acquisition targets include video game developers Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts, and Take Two Interactive Software as well as video streaming service Hulu. The analyst said the targets were screened considering five criteria - strategic fit, global scale, transaction size, few non-strategic assets and likely impact on Apple's share price. Under pressure from shareholders to hand over more of its cash hoard, Apple recently boosted its capital return program by $50 billion, increased its share buyback program by $35 billion and raised its quarterly dividend by 10.5 percent.

Steve Jobs might have said so. Back in 1995, when the tech god was between gigs at Apple, when he had learned a thing or three about leadership by being snaked out of his own company by John Sculley, he gave an interview positing that empires could crash and burn if the emphasis was on sales rather than product. "The companies forget what it means to make great products," Jobs said. "The product sensibility and the product genius that brought them to that monopolistic position gets rotted out by people running these companies who have no conception of a good product versus a bad product. They have no conception of the craftsmanship that's required to take a good idea and turn it into a good product. And they really have no feeling in their hearts usually about wanting to really help the customers." In "The Art of the Deal," Trump said that playing to people's fantasies and promising the greatest product was "an innocent form of exaggeration." But it's one thing when you do that for condos and cologne and mattresses and steaks. It's another for life-or-death health care policy. Trump has twice pushed to pass disgraceful health care bills without even trying to grasp what's in them — or more important, what's not in them. He couldn't care less that the dog's breakfast served up by the House on Thursday wounds the struggling Americans he had promised to lift up. It is "something terrific," as he vowed, but only for the superrich who are getting a Marie Antoinette wealth transfer at the expense of health care for the poor. The president feted his fake-news "win" in the Rose Garden, sprinkling flimflam dust to deflect from his ludicrous legislation. Paul Ryan slobbered over Trump's leadership even as the Senate made plans to shred the House bill and start over. "Hey, I'm president," Trump told his sycophants, or in this case, sickophants. "Can you believe it, right?" No, I can't. In a moment of clueless cynicism, hours after the ego festival in the Rose Garden, Trump sat in a tuxedo with the Australian prime minister on the Intrepid and said Australians have better health care than Americans — harking back to his old statements in support of universal health care. Presidents have to be good salesmen. Barack Obama faltered because he hated selling and simply lectured. He even outsourced the job of selling his re-election bid at the 2012 convention to a former antagonist, Bill Clinton. Hillary was not good at salesmanship either. The new book "Shattered: Inside Hillary Clinton's Doomed Campaign," reports that at one point, her 2016 team got so flummoxed at her inability to explain why she wanted to be president that they actually considered the slogan "Because It's Her Turn." Trump did care about his product when he built Trump Tower. He obsessed over every detail of a building that was the flashy emblem of New York bursting out of the dark '70s and into the booming '80s. "But the success of that went to his head and he never cared again," his biographer Tim O'Brien told me. "He's fundamentally lazy. He free-rides so many processes he doesn't know anything about. He used to do it in the business world, and now he does it in the political world." When Trump talked to John Dickerson for "Face the Nation" last Sunday, he said the big difference between business and politics was that in Washington, "you really need heart, because you're talking about a lot of people. Whereas in business, you don't need so much heart. You want to make a good deal." The House Republicans just wanted Trump off their backs. They had never pulled a real bill together because they thought Hillary would win and they could just snipe at her. The Irish undertaker and his crew were so desperate to prove they had not totally forgotten how to pass anything that they were willing to go with garbage. And Ryan wanted to save the bacon — or bratwurst — of his fellow Wisconsin buddy Reince Priebus, blamed by Trump for the first health care defeat. But in delivering this win for Trump, they may well have delivered a way for Democrats to take the president down. The Democrats could win the House back and get their investigative machinery cranking. The Cook Political Report has now downgraded the 2018 re-election chances of 20 House Republicans. The Republicans now have a pre-existing condition: They voted for something that will cause them a lot of pain in the future. Dowd writes for the New York Times. This is a TU+ story.

On the internet As well as making “Wolfenstein 3D” available to purchase for Windows PC through Steam, through the PSN Store for PS3, or through the Microsoft Store for Xbox 360 and Xbox One, current rights holder Bethesda Software has a live version playable via 3d.wolfenstein.com. The Internet Archive has also reproduced it as a browser game at archive.org/details/msdos_Wolfenstein_3D_1992. On a mobile phone Originating studio Id Software has provided two versions of Wolfenstein 3D to play on iOS devices, “Wolfenstein 3D Classic Lite” (free, itunes.apple.com/app/id313423706) and Wolfenstein 3D Classic Platinum ($1.99 USD, itunes.apple.com/app/id309470478.) Both provide a choice between touch and tilt controls across 6 episodes and 60 levels. An unofficial Android port, ECWolf, is available through maniacsvault.net, whose developer put his skills to work on the Mac, PC, Linux, and Android update of low-violence “Wolf 3D” adaptation and cult curiosity “Super 3D Noah’s Ark” (wisdomtree.itch.io/s3dna.) In experimental VR Several options present themselves to those that have access to an Oculus Rift or similarly capable Virtual Reality headset, including DOSCulus, a version of the popular DOSBox wrapper that efficiently enables modern computers to play games from a bygone era — a trailer for the application uses Wolfenstein 3D’s sequel Spear of Destiny as its showreel — as well as MemoRift, which creates a virtual retro games room, and the more focused “Wolfenstein 3D VR,” which requires a motion-sensing Kinect camera as well as a Rift. As a fully destructible homage Like its oft-copied Id Software successor, “Doom,” albeit to a lesser extent, “Wolfenstein 3D” has been a proof of concept for programmers’ or designers’ abilities. To that effect, the team at South African studio Free Lives (“BroForce,” “Yojimbrawl”) put together the anarchic and frequently hilarious “Super Wolfenstein HD” using destructible walls and twitchy ragdoll enemies for the Indies vs PewDiePie contest (free for Windows PC through Gamejolt); “Voxelstein 3D” takes the “Minecraft” approach and applies it to a “Wolfenstein” remake in which players can saw and blast their way through an enemy base (Win PC, voxelstein3d.sourceforge.net). Inside a franchise reboot Where 2011’s Bethesda-published “Rage” contained a single secret “Wolfenstein Room,” and bold 2014 reboot “Wolfenstein: The New Order” contained the game’s first level tucked away, 2015’s standalone expansion “Wolfenstein: The Old Blood” (for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Windows PC) took nine levels from the 1992 classic and recreated them as Nightmare Levels, accessible by making the main character nap in hidden beds.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: Moe Slah Report claims iPhone 8 will not feature a truly edge-to-edge display Yoni Heisler @edibleapple May 6th, 2017 at 3:56 PM Share Tweet I’m not sure what’s going on with JPMorgan these days, but the financial services firm over the past few weeks has published a number of bizarre research reports concerning Apple’s upcoming iPhone 8. Not too long after analyst Rod Hall issued an analyst note claiming that Apple will unveil the iPhone 8 at WWDC, the firm recently published a new research report alleging that everything we thought we knew about the iPhone 8’s edge-to-edge display has been completely off base. Don't Miss: NASA’s Saturn spacecraft just delivered photos so stunning you’ll think they’re fake In a note first spotted by 9to5Mac, JPMorgan analysts claim that the iPhone 8’s  5.8-inch edge-to-edge OLED display will only be edge-to-edge horizontally, not all across the device. In other words, JPMorgan believes that the final iPhone 8 design will not feature a display that takes up the entire front of the device. On the contrary, there will be discernible bezels located on both the top and bottom of the device. This of course is at odds with any number of leaked schematics and rumors which point to a sleek iPhone design with minimal 4mm bezels surrounding the entirety of the display. To date, most iPhone 8 rumors we’ve seen claim that the device will look something like this, with the Touch ID sensor embedded into the display itself. JPMorgan, meanwhile, anticipates that the iPhone 8, upon its release, will sport a design that looks something like this. Now to be fair, it’s more than plausible that the final iPhone 8 design will look similar to the design featured above. And while it’s hard to ignore that this particular iPhone design flies in the face of every single iPhone 8 rumor we’ve seen to date, it’s worth noting that Apple typically experiments with any number of varying iPhone prototypes before deciding which model will actually go to mass production. Nonetheless, JPMorgan doesn’t exactly have a lengthy or impressive track record with respect to Apple rumors, so you might want to take their most recent analyst report with the requisite grain of salt. Even more bizarre, though, is the JPMorgan claim that Apple may include free AirPods inside of every new iPhone 8 box. This seems beyond unlikely for a number of reasons, one of which is that Apple didn’t amass a quarter-trillion dollars in the bank by literally giving money away. AirPods have proven to be a surprise hit for Apple, so much so that the company still can’t manufacture enough of them to meet swelling demand. Consider this: AirPods became available in mid-December and there’s still a 6 week shipping delay — per Apple’s website — if you put in an order today. The idea that Apple will give away $159 headphones for free with every iPhone 8 purchase — when it still can’t satisfy demand from customers all to happy to pay for them — seems beyond far-fetched, to say the least. As far as other iPhone 8 rumors are concerned, JPMorgan says that the iPhone 8 will feature 3D cameras, a feature that will reportedly be used for facial recognition and advanced augmented reality functionality. As a point of interest, we’ve seen rumblings that the iPhone 8’s advanced 3D cameras may be the reason behind the delayed iPhone 8 release date. Recall, it’s believed that the iPhone 8 has a slim chance of actually launching in September, with a more realistic launch window likely set for October, or in a worse case scenario, November. Specifically, Apple component supplier STMicroelectronics will reportedly not have enough 3D camera modules ready in time to support an iPhone 8 release date in September. Regardless of when the iPhone 8 actually launches, the larger takeaway is that the device will help spur what many analysts believe will be the largest iPhone refresh in history.

Don't be afraid, it's not as complicated as it sounds. Todd Haselton | @robotodd 10 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES Todd Haselton | CNBC Every morning I wake up, drive to Dunkin' Donuts and tap my phone to buy a large iced coffee. There's something fun about that experience. I don't have to reach for my wallet and search for cash or pull out a debit card. I just lean over the debit card reader at the coffee shop, tap my phone, and go on with my life. You need a phone that supports this functionality to partake in the fun, but most devices sold over the past couple of years work in that fashion. Three primary options are available: Android Pay for most Android smartphones, Samsung Pay for Samsung smartphones and Apple Pay for iPhones. Here's how to get started with each one. Android Pay Todd Haselton | CNBC Android Pay hasn't grabbed headlines like it did when it first launched, but it's still a very viable option on most Android smartphones. It's your best bet if you have an Android phone but it isn't a Samsung device with Samsung Pay. Download Android Pay from the Google Play App Store. Open the app and tap "Add Credit or Debit card." You can choose cards already associated with your Google Account or add a new one. Agree to the terms and conditions that pop up. Then verify your card via email (you'll receive a number to enter into the app) That's it! Now, the next time you see a card reader with the Android Pay logo, just open the app, choose your card, and tap to pay. Samsung Pay Todd Haselton | CNBC Samsung Pay is my favorite of mobile payment options because it's able to work with more checkout terminals. In fact, it even works on older machines that only have magnetic stripe readers, thanks to technology from Samsung's acquisition of a company named LoopPay. Here's how to set it up. Open up Samsung Pay, which should be pre-installed on your Samsung smartphone. (If for some reason you don't have it, get it here.) If you're prompted to sign in, use your Samsung account credentials or create an account. This is where you'll also create a PIN for accessing your cards before payment. Tap credit/debit cards and then tap "Add." Use the camera viewfinder to center your credit card. This allows your phone to capture the card number, expiration date and your name. You can also enter this in manually. Next add in the verification code. You'll need to confirm your card with a code sent to you via email or text message from your bank. Enter this in. Now you're ready to go. Samsung lets you swipe up from the bottom of the home screen to easily access your cards when you're ready to pay, and you'll verify your identity with a pre-set pin code or your irises (if you have a newer Galaxy S8 or Galaxy S8+ smartphone. Samsung Pay is even offering a temporary promotion for a free $20 gift card for registering your first card, which you can use anywhere Samsung Pay is accepted. Apple Pay Todd Haselton | CNBC You might already have Apple Pay set up without knowing it. Apple's iPhone asks if you want to get started while you're initiating your phone for the first time, and Apple Pay can be used in the App Store or for mobile payments. If you're not sure, open up the Apple Wallet application, which is pre-installed on your phone. If you don't see any credit cards under the Pay icon, tap the + button at the top-right of the screen to add one. If you don't have Touch ID setup yet, you'll be walked through registering your fingerprints. Next, use the camera viewfinder to scan in your card. Just center it in the frame and Apple Pay will grab all of the details, or you can enter them manually.

Some folks don't have the entire Apple ecosystem. iPad is arguably one of the most popular tablets around (if not the most popular), but many iPad users don't use iPhone — they're on Android, and that's OK. I run Android, but I use an iPad for mobile gaming and reading digital comics. Syncing between the two platforms isn't inherent, but you can sync Reminders and lists with certain apps. That way the whole family can stay on the same page, no matter which operating system each person prefers. How to sync reminders and calendars between iPad and Android How to add events and reminders to Google Calendar for iPhone and iPad How to sync reminders and calendars between iPad and Android Use the Google Calendar app. It's absolutely the best way to sync reminders and calendars across both platforms. When you use Google Assistant on your Android phone, the reminder is automatically added to the Reminders calendar in Google Calendar. Even if you don't have Assistant, using Google Calendar for reminders is the perfect way to see all of your to-dos, whether they be simple, menial things or upcoming events. Download the Google Calendar app for iOS, sign in with your Google account, and boom – reminders and events are automatically synced. The unfortunate aspect of this process is the lack of support for Siri if you're going the other way. If you have an Android tablet and want to sync reminders from iPhone, you won't be able to sync your reminders from the Reminders app. You could sync over your Calendar app events by subscribing to your calendar's URL in Google Calendar, but that's not always best, since events can take up to 24 hours to show up in your Google Calendar. Apple does let you sync Reminders with other accounts, but your options are pretty much everything but Google (who'da thunk?!). If you want to sync reminders and calendars between iOS and Android, just use the Google Calendar app for everything. All you have to do is sign in and it's all there. You may have to mess with your sync settings, but that's about it. That's the price we pay for walking in both worlds. C'est la vie. There are other Android apps that help with syncing, but many are quite hit and miss and some of the more popular ones, like SmoothSync, haven't been updated in years. How to add events and reminders to Google Calendar How to add events and reminders to Google Calendar for iPhone and iPad Adding events and reminders to Google Calendar is pretty much the same as adding them to any other calendar app. Launch Google Calendar from your Home screen. Tap the switch next to an account if you already use Google accounts on your iPhone or iPad. Otherwise, tap Add a Google account and sign in. Tap Get Started. Google Calendar will load all existing events for that account. Tap the add button in the bottom right corner of your screen. It's the red + button. Tap Reminder or Event. Tap the green area below the X to enter a title and tap Done. Tap the date to scroll and change it. You can set the time as well or tap the switch to make it an all-day event. You can then add a location to your event or reminder, as well as notifications, and you can change its color, and add notes and attachments. Need something more intensive? If you think you need something a little more robust than Google Calendar, then you might want to check out some third-party apps, like: Evernote — Free, w/ IAPs — iOS, Android Microsoft OneNote — Free — iOS, Android Questions?

The Apple Inc. (Nasdaq: AAPL) piggy bank continues to fatten thanks mostly to its "cash cow," the iPhone, which rakes in about two-thirds of the company's profits. Just as impressive as how much cash Apple has is how quickly it accumulates. The Apple cash pile breached $200 billion as recently as July 2015. It was just five years ago that Apple crossed the $100 billion threshold. And a decade ago Apple's stash stood at only $15.4 billion. The almost incomprehensible number makes for some very odd comparisons… Apple Has More Cash on Hand Than Most Companies Are Worth Apple's $256.8 billion in cash is the most by far of any U.S. company. Second-place Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq: MSFT), with just $126 billion, has less than half of Apple's cash stockpile. Apple's cash hoard is so enormous that it's bigger than the market capitalizations of most companies. Only 10 companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 have valuations greater than Apple's cash hoard. That puts Apple's cash on hand just ahead of the $253.9 billion market cap of General Electric Co. (NYSE: GE) and just behind the $277.2 billion market cap of Wells Fargo & Co. (NYSE: WFC). If Apple's cash were a country, it would rank 41st, ahead of the gross domestic products of such nations as Venezuela, Pakistan, and Chile. But all this begs the question: Why does Apple have so much cash, anyway? Why isn't the company spending it on something? The main reason Apple has so much cash is that most of it consists of profits earned overseas. Apple CEO Tim Cook thinks the U.S. corporate tax rate of 35% is too high, so he's refused to bring the money home. And it keeps piling up. Don't Miss: The Secret That Can Turn $2,500 into $1 Million or More About 93%, or $239 billion, of the Apple cash pile consists of stranded profits earned in foreign countries. But President Donald Trump vowed to reduce the U.S. corporate tax rate during his campaign. And last week his comprehensive tax reform proposal included a call to chop the corporate tax rate to 15%. If that tax cut (or something close to it) becomes law, the giant Apple cash pile may shrink in a hurry. Apple could then use the money to beef up R&D spending, make a large acquisition or two, and return cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. That's how most companies use spare cash. But to get a better idea of just how mind-blowingly huge the Apple cash hoard is, here's what the company could do with $256.8 billion… How Much Cash Does Apple Have?

The weekend known as "Woodstock for Capitalists" is unique in corporate America, a celebration of the billionaire's image and success at a conglomerate whose businesses range from Geico insurance to the BNSF railroad to See's candies to Ginsu knives. Below are a few of the comments from Buffett, the "Oracle of Omaha," on topics ranging from Wells Fargo to celebrating a pioneer of index funds. ON FUTURE ACQUISITIONS "Charlie and I really do not discuss sectors much ... we're really opportunistic. We're looking at all kinds of businesses all of the time. We're hoping, we get a call ... and we know in the first five minutes whether (a deal) has a reasonable chance of happening." "We (like) companies where consumer behavior can be (predicted) further off." "We don't really say we'll go after companies in this field or that field." ON COAL "Over time, coal is essentially certain to decline as a percentage of the revenue of the (BNSF) railroad. We are looking for other sources of growth (besides) coal." "In my mind, we're going to be shipping less coal 10 or 20 years from now. The coal aspect (of the business) is going to diminish." ON EATING JUNK FOOD "I don't mind having 500-600 calories for dessert. I'll let someone else have the broccoli." ON RUNNING A HANDS-OFF CONGLOMERATE "I think our hands-off style actually can add significant value to many companies. We free up at least 20 percent of the time for a CEO (compared to running) a public company." "I think we bring something to the party." ON TECHNOLOGY HOLDINGS IBM AND APPLE "When I bought IBM six years ago, I thought it would do better in the six years ... than it has. Apple is much more of a consumer products business. In terms of analyzing moats around it, consumer behavior ... they are two different types of decisions. I was wrong on the first one, and we'll find out whether I was right on the second." "I could be making two mistakes on IBM. It's harder to predict in my view ... how much price competition will enter in something like cloud services." "We missed (Amazon.com) entirely. We've never owned a share." ON AIRLINES "It's a fiercely competitive industry. The question is if it's a suicidally competitive industry. It has been operating at 80 percent or better of capacity for some time ... it's fair to say they will operate at higher degrees of capacity over the next 5 or 10 years than at historical rates. They actually at present are earning quite high returns on invested capital, I think higher than FedEx or UPS." "It is no cinch that the industry will have more pricing sensibility in the next 10 years, but the conditions have improved for that." ON INTEREST RATES "I do not think it's easy to predict the (course) of interest rates at all." ON VOLATILITY "It is the nature of market systems to occasionally go haywire in one direction or another." "When the rest of the world is fearful, we know America is going to come out fine." ON MARKET SPECULATION "(Keynes said) there's always some speculation ... People can get very excited about speculating in markets. There's nothing more agonizing than to see your neighbor (getting richer). Early on in the development of markets there's probably some tendency to be more speculative than markets that have been around for a couple hundred years. Markets have a casino characteristic that has a lot of appeal. "China being a newer market ... is likely to have some pretty extreme experiences." "Fear spreads like you cannot believe. The way the public can react is really extreme ... and that offers opportunities for investors." "Markets are there to be taken advantage of." CHARLIE MUNGER ON BERKSHIRE'S ADVANTAGE "I think we have one big advantage. A lot of other people are trying to be brilliant, and we're just trying to stay rational." MUNGER ON BUFFETT "You're a fatter version of Mahatma Gandhi." ON WELLS FARGO, IN WHICH BERKSHIRE OWNS $27.8 BLN STAKE "At Wells Fargo, there were three significant mistakes, but one dwarfs all of the others ... You have to be careful what you incentivize. There was an incentive system built around cross-selling ... That was incentivizing the wrong kind of behavior." "The main problem was they didn't act when they learned about it." ON BERKSHIRE'S EARNINGS REPORT "The realized investment gains or losses in any period really mean nothing ... We don't really think about the timing of what we do. We do not make earnings forecasts." "I feel very good about the first quarter even though our operating earnings were down a little bit." ON VANGUARD FOUNDER JACK BOGLE "It was not in the interests of Wall Street to have the development of index funds, because it brought down fees dramatically. When Jack started, very few people, certainly Wall Street did not applaud him. He was the subject of some derision. And now we're talking trillions when we get into index funds. "Jack at a minimum has saved, in the pockets of investors, he's put tens and tens and tens of billions into their pockets. It's Jack's 88th birthday on Monday. Happy birthday, Jack and thank you on behalf of (investors)." ON AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES "Driverless trucks are a lot more of a threat than an opportunity to Burlington Northern." "Autonomous vehicles, widespread, would hurt us if they spread to trucks, and they would hurt our auto insurance business. They may be a long way off. That will depend on experience in the first early months of the introduction. If they make the world safer, it will be a very good thing but it won't be a good thing for auto insurers."

[Update: Groupon] Deal Alert: Bragi's truly wireless earbuds, The Dash, are $100 on Woot for a refurbished pair ($200 off) Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/05/05 1:10am PDTMay 5, 2017 4 Plus 1 on G+ 23 Share on Facebook 39 Share on Twitter Total Shares66 Deals News Update 1: 2017/05/05 1:20am PDT The same deal is now available on Groupon: $99.99 for a pair of manufacturer refurbished The Dash earbuds. Thanks Isaac! The completely wireless earbud trend started several years ago, long before Apple's Airpods, and Bragi was one of the companies at the forefront of the technology. After the inevitable delays that plague every Kickstarter product, Bragi managed to ship The Dash and actually deliver on its promise. In my review of the earbuds, I found the technology a little magical, the NFMI transmission between the two earbuds more reliable than Bluetooth, the design completely freeing, and the basic features well done. It was all the other plusses, from the touch interface to the heart rate and sports monitoring, that left me much less impressed and in the end are why I couldn't recommend them unless you had the cash lying around. But when you divide the original asking price of $299 by three (almost) to $99.99, The Dash does become a lot more appealing. It's a more realistic price to get one of the most feature-packed and yet, like its entire ilk, still very experimental wireless earbuds. And that's the deal that Woot! is running today on its Sellout section. However, it's a certified refurbished pair, factory reconditioned, with all new accessories (charging case, FitSleeves, and MicroUSB cable), and only the black color is available. But for comparison, Amazon wants $208 for a new pair now, which I think is too much for something you might be buying just to discover the technology and see if it fits your lifestyle. If you're interested in Woot's deal, you have about 19 hours left to make up your mind. I'll leave the link right below.

Been eyeing these for a while, but couldn't get past the steep price. At $99 I'm giving them a shot. :) thespacecowboy Those reviews are pretty bad. I have way too many headphone and am intrigued, but i think there's a reason they are on steep sale. M Prindle Yea I checked Amazon and they have 33% 1 Star reviews. Major issues like charging pins breaking, Bluetooth dropping out while sitting in one place, and others. I'll pass this time around. Detonation The bluetooth issues are scaring me away from these and others. I have a pair of Jaybird X2's and I can't remember the last time I had a cutout, so I will wait until they work the bt kinks out or my x2's die. Hopefully the airpod success will push the market forward more. I did see that there are now off-brand wireless buds like these on Amazon for around $50. No idea how good they are though. Jesse Afolabi Exactly my thought.. motoridersd The bluetooth performance does not match the X2s, but it does not make them impossible to use. They work well if the phone/tablet is in direct line of sight of the receiving earbud (left side I think). When you start adding things between them, you get dropouts. Since the earbuds are inside your ear, they really struggle to get the bluetooth signal across extra obstacles. I think this is where the seemingly odd stick of the Apple ones have an advantage over other in ear buds. It's also important to remember that these were designed over 3 years ago, so there are improved versions out there. I use them on flights, while working, and even while working out, as long as I have the phone on the correct side pocket or side of the equipment I'm using at the gym. They're not perfect, but if you don't like wires, they're a great value at $99 Loco Mole If the primary reason is to be wireless, then there are better ones less than $99. Advanced EVO X at $59 is one. And then, there are BT over-the-ears cans like those by Creative that are much better. ericshmerick Most of the reviews are complaining about the bluetooth performance which Bragi says has been recently fixed (firmware). Also keep in mind the reviews are probably from people who dropped $300 on these, so they are expecting perfection...so of course they are going to publicly chastise the product at the slightest whiff of an issue. At $99, they are kinda a deal. I'm tempted. motoridersd At $99, they are a steal. I was one of the original backers at $199, and then waited over 2 years to get them. The bluetooth performance is not as good as other wireless headphones, my BlueBuds X outperform the Bragi easily. Audio can drop out even if you have the phone in the same side pocket as the receiving earphone. The connection between them always works great though, so the internal music player is always a good option if you're worried about audio while exercising for example. The battery life is also not as long as the BlueBuds, but for 1-2 hour sessions, the charging case is perfect to keep them topped up. I usually run out of juice during long flights. jaycemiskel I have these headphones and I never use them because of the poor Bluetooth performance. Also, one headphone is way quieter than the other. I had them repaired and the same issue is happening again. I did pay 300 for them, but honestly, I wouldn't pay 100 for them either. I have some Blue Buds X and the X3s and they're light years better. Don't waste your money on these. Nick Cannon Are refurbs normally $300? NooSH eh, too late.. i just bought the Pump zone bluetooth headphones by BlueAnt .. for $45 you get amazing sound and deep bass with super comfy ear cushions and reliable bluetooth connection with a 30+ hour battery , and this is all from my own experience so far. but if you must need these super wireless ear plugs then by all means.. but when it comes to their purpose, they fail in that category imo with that weaksauce battery , cheap wireless cut outs and high price tag. i just can't justify the price , even at $99. ericshmerick What? The headphones you bought are a for completely different target audience. Glad you are happy, but anyone interested in these tiny things aren't going to angrily bail and get a huge over ear alternative. Anthony I want this NinoBr0wn Those things cost $300?

Apple recalls thousands of iPhone 6s in UAE Claire Bautista February 10, 2017 3:07 pm TECHNOLOGY 1.9K 0 DUBAI – Tech giant Apple is set to recall 88,000 iPhone 6s handsets in UAE due to battery issues, a media report stated. According to a khaleejtimes.com report, citing Arabic daily Emarat Al Youm, the UAE’s Ministry of Economy stated that only specific iPhone 6s which contain defective batteries made in China during September and October 2015 will be recalled. Apple has recently expressed that a very small number of iPhone 6s devices may unexpectedly shut down. If you have experienced this issue, the firm has urged residents to use the serial number checker (www.apple.com/ae/support/iPhone6s-unexpectedshutdown/) if your iPhone 6s is eligible for a battery replacement, free of charge.

Trash baskets are mysteriously vanishing from Big Apple street corners, and one Sanitation official says it’s a citywide problem caused by scrap-metal thieves. The baffling basket cases are particularly plaguing the Upper West Side, City Councilwoman Helen Rosenthal told The Post. She said residents recently reported containers missing along Amsterdam Avenue and Broadway in the low 70s and Central Park West in the 80s. The lawmaker said the trash can “right in front of my office” on 87th and Columbus also “went missing.” When Rosenthal raised the issue at her April 25 town hall meeting, Sanitation official Ignazio Terranova confirmed the community’s worst fears. “You are 100 percent correct,” the community affairs officer told the nearly 200 people in attendance. “Baskets have been disappearing, not just here in Community Board 7, but we’re having this problem citywide. And it’s because the price of metal actually is really good right now, so people are stealing our baskets and bringing them in [as] scrap,” he said. Of the city’s 23,500 litter baskets, the most common design is the steel wire-mesh container. It weighs 32 pounds and costs about $125 new. Scrap yards last week quoted the going rate for the steel as between 5 ¹/₂ and 6 ¹/₂ cents per pound — or about $2 a can. Joseph Giacalone, a retired NYPD detective sergeant and professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, wasn’t surprised by the reemergence of a cyclical crime trend and urged the NYPD and public to be “vigilant.” “Stealing city-owned garbage cans for scrap is not something to be taken lightly and it’s a trend that needs to be nipped in the bud,” he said. The Sanitation Department downplayed the trend, despite its own official revealing it. Agency spokesman Vito Turso insisted in a written statement that “there are no ‘mysterious’ litter basket disappearances on the West Side or anywhere else in NYC.” Litter baskets “are sometimes stolen, they are improperly relocated by neighbors from their assigned street corners (to mid-block), they are often removed by DSNY for special events or for NYPD security operations, and they are sometimes brought in for repair after being hit when locals place them in the street to steer drivers away from potholes or other unusual road conditions,” he said. “We also remove baskets that are being abused and misused by local residents who illegally toss their household trash into them. (a $100 fine) But theft is NOT and has not been a serious issue.” Turso said Sanitation annually loses “around 100 or so” of its baskets for “unknown reasons.” The NYPD said last week it knew of no complaints regarding stolen baskets. Police officers from the 20th and 24th precincts attended the April 25 town hall.

Photo: Bloomberg London real-estate agents have begun to offer free cars worth ￡18,000 (US$23,369), stamp duty subsidies of ￡150,000, and free Apple Inc iPads and Sonos sound systems to boost sales in the British capital’s increasingly moribund property market. The once super-hot central London market has turned into a “burnt-out core,” buying agents Garrington Property Finders Ltd said, prompting developers to offer ever-greater incentives to lure buyers. At one development in Muswell Hill, a relatively affluent part of north London, sales agents last week said they would be giving away a Renault Zoe electric car, priced at ￡18,045, to every buyer. They said they would also pay stamp duty on the ￡1.99 million homes, at ￡153,000. Apart from the free prosecco and gourmet pizzas available to people viewing the properties, anyone willing to put down a ￡2,500 deposit at the development’s launch night would also walk away with a free iPad, they said. The developer, Jamm, says that sales are robust and that “this is absolutely not a sign of desperation.” “There is a lot of nervousness out there with the election and Brexit, and buyers are looking for excuses not to buy. We’re giving them reasons to buy,” Jamm director Tim Jackson said. Free furniture packages worth up to ￡20,000, John Lewis vouchers and free three-year travel passes have all been offered to potential buyers in other developments across the city. Property agent Henry Pryor said that there is a pipeline of 59,000 high-end apartments under construction in London alone, yet annual sales of new flats in the city are only 6,000. “Developers will sell their first-born to shift them. It’s last-chance-saloon stuff. About the only incentive they have not tried is a BOGOF [buy one, get one free],” Pryor said. The developer behind the giant Battersea Power Station development of 4,360 apartments in south London last week slashed its profit forecasts amid rising costs and wider economic uncertainty. House prices have begun to fall nationally — Nationwide Building Society said typical prices fell in both March and last month — and the steepest drops have been seen in London. UK Land Registry figures show that in the heart of the city’s financial district, average property prices plummeted from ￡861,000 at the time of the EU referendum in June last year to ￡773,000 in February, a decline of 15 percent, although in London’s outer boroughs prices are still up over the year. Transactions — the lifeblood of real-estate agents, who rely on turnover rather than high prices to make money — have also fallen steeply. Garrington said the “hipster hotspot” of Hackney last year saw sales collapse by more than a third and there have been few signs of a recovery since. LCP Management Ltd, a property investment company, blamed big hikes in stamp duty for a collapse in sales. It said that in central London, sales of new flats were down 41.4 percent in the last three months of last year compared with the previous year, while average prices fell 8.7 percent over the same period to ￡1.9 million. Chinese buyers had melted away, Pryor said. “The Chinese are finding it more difficult to borrow from their own banks and the gloss has gone off the London market. Foreign buyers were a very significant part of the new-build market, but they can’t get a yield, and they now can’t flip them for capital gain.” 1 2 NEXT › This story has been viewed 1563 times.

Schiller spoke with Gadgets 360 following the inauguration of the company’s app accelerator facility in Bengaluru. Questioned about the possibility of allowing App Store developers to charge for upgrades, Schiller said it was much more complex than many would think. He also believes the subscription model is better. "I think for many developers, subscription model is a better way to, go than try to come up with a list of features, and different pricing for upgrade, versus for new customers. I am not saying it doesn't have value for some developers but for most it doesn’t, so that's the challenge. And if you look at the App Store it would take a lot of engineering to do that and so would be at the expense of other features we can deliver." Schiller was also asked to comment on the Amazon Echo and Google Home. Apple is rumored to be releasing a competitor to those devices as early as WWDC. Schiller believes that the lack of a screen is a hindrance. Ironically, just yesterday photos of an alleged Amazon Echo with a display were leaked. "So there's many moments where a voice assistant is really beneficial, but that doesn't mean you'd never want a screen. So the idea of not having a screen, I don't think suits many situations. For example if I'm looking for directions and I'm using Maps, Siri can tell me those directions by voice and that's really convenient but it's even better if I can see that map, and I can see what turns are coming up, and I can see where there is congestion, I understand better my route, and what I'm going to do." Discussing the company's Swift programming language, Schiller revealed that Apple has been learning from the first versions and will announce what's to come at WWDC. "We are continuing to evolve [Swift], as you say, we were very upfront about it from the beginning that we knew we would learn a lot in the first versions of Swift, and we have been [learning]. So developers are aware of that and we’ve been very transparent about that, and there will be a lot more about that at our upcoming developer conference, so for the remaining part of your question about what’s coming with Swift, there’s a lot to come, stay tuned for news on that."

That only works out when they have a strong monopoly (like Adobe). I would always avoid it as i can't / don't want to pay tor that. Do the math: every month you'd have pay for ISP, office sw, photo sw, video sw, music streaming, movie & TV streaming, some online gaming, cable tv, maybe car leasing, apartment, income tax, healthcare, insurance just to cover the most basic needs... Now what do you think how much more one would want to pay on any other crummy sw and lock all personal data in with a provider that won't allow to access or process it any further should you not be able to pay for the rest of your life?

But why bother trying to hunt down another console when the smartphone in your pocket can already do almost everything the Switch can-with a few upgrades. You probably occasionally use your smartphone as a portable gaming machine, although limited to just quick rounds of Candy Crush as you ride the subway every day. But a modern smartphone, with a beefy processor and a decent-sized display, can do almost everything the Nintendo Switch can (sadly Breath of the Wild will still be out of your reach). In fact, your smartphone might actually offer a few upgrades over the Switch! There are far more games available, including emulators that let you play classic titles from almost any console. Though you'll need to put in a little effort if you want to play old Zelda games on your iPhone. Advertisement Advertisement Besides games, your phone almost certainly offers a better visual experience than the Switch does. Nintendo chose to use an LCD display limited to a resolution of just 1280x720 pixels and many smartphones are capable of at least full 1920x1080 HD resolutions with color saturation and fidelity that far outperform the Switch's screen. But having access to thousands of great titles on a beautiful screen means nothing when trying to play action games using a touchscreen. Ask anyone who's tried, it is an act of absolute frustration. Controllers So the first upgrade you'll need to turn your smartphone into a Switch are some better controls. After all, touchscreens suck when it comes to playing games that require more than just tapping the screen. With the right accessories you can almost perfectly emulate the Switch's handheld gaming experience, or connect multiple wireless controllers for some mobile multiplayer. Switch Style Controllers Gamevice Controller (iOS) The closest you'll get to recreating the Nintendo Switch's form factor is the $100 Gamevice that wraps your smartphone in a pair of halved controllers featuring analog joysticks, a directional pad, and a set of four action buttons. You'll at least need an iPhone 6 to use it, but it connects to the device's Lightning port without the need for battery-sucking Bluetooth. MOGA Ace Power Controller (iOS) It's essentially the same product as the Gamevice, but the MOGA Ace Power packs a rechargeable battery to help keep your smartphone running longer. You can find it online for as cheap as $20, but it's only compatible with older iPhones. Anything larger than the iPhone 5s will be too big for the MOGA Ace Power to wrap around. 8Bitdo Zero Controller (iOS & Android) The Switch's two controllers handily slide off either end of the console to be used for multiplayer experiences, and if you want a similarly super tiny controller for your iOS or Android device than maybe you should consider the $17 8Bitdo Zero . It works with any device that can wirelessly connect to Bluetooth peripherals and offers basic controls including shoulder buttons, a directional pad, and four action buttons. Switch Pro Style Controllers SteelSeries Stratus XL Controller (Android) We're a big fan of SteelSeries, so while the $60 the SteelSeries Stratus XL isn't ideal for traveling, we still think it's a good choice for when your smartphone's connected to a TV for big-screen gaming. It's not as cool as a Switch controller but its a comparable alternative to the Nintendo Switch's Pro Controller. And while it doesn't have any force feedback features, it does promise 40 hours of gameplay on a single pair of AA batteries. SteelSeries Nimbus Controller (iOS) The $50 SteelSeries Nimbus wireless controller is the iOS equivalent of the company's Stratus XL, giving you essentially the same experience as the full-size Nintendo Switch Pro Controller. With a few bonuses: It can be charged using the same Lightning cable you plug your iPhone into every night, and it features a dedicated menu button for navigating iOS or your Apple TV. 8Bitdo Wireless NES & SNES Controllers (iOS & Android) The Nintendo Switch will inevitably get access to the company's Virtual Console, letting you play your favorite classic games. But with a smartphone running an emulator you can play them all now. And with 8Bitdo's $35 NES and SNES Bluetooth controllers , near-perfect recreations of the originals, you might feel like you're back in your parent's basement, slamming Capri Suns while playing Super Mario World . Video Adapters One of the Nintendo Switch's most unique features is its ability to transform from a handheld gaming system to a part of your entertainment center so you can play your games on a big screen TV. The Switch relies on a cumbersome dock to do this, but there are more elegant ways to connect your smartphone to a TV, including going wireless. Advertisement Sponsored There are pros and cons to each approach, however, so you'll need to decide what works best for you. Going wireless means you don't have to deal with your smartphone being tethered to a long HDMI cable. But it might mean some costly hardware upgrades if you don't already have a reliable wireless network in your home, or a TV setup that facilitates streaming from a mobile device. Using a video adapter physically connected to your TV means you'll have to wrangle HDMI and charging cables while you play. Yet it also guarantees smooth frame rates at all times, and the ability to enjoy your games on a friend's TV, or a TV in a hotel room, where you can't easily connect to a reliable (or secure) wireless network. The Wireless Options Apple TV (iOS) If you want to wirelessly connect your iPhone to your TV using AirPlay, the Apple TV is your easiest solution. However, at $149 it's half the price of a Nintendo Switch, and you'll need to ensure your wireless router is up to the task of streaming video to your TV without dropping frames, which can ruin the gaming experience. Google Chromecast (Android) Chromcast can with iPhones games streamed to the TV too, but the experience isn't always pleasant. Yet, for mirroring the gaming action on your Android smartphone to a TV, using a Google Chromecast is the way to go. Its small and unobtrusive and is only $35. That's a downright bargain-as long as you can live with resolutions that top out at 1920x1080 HD. Google Chromecast Ultra (Android) Can the Nintendo Switch do 4K? Nope. But your Android smartphone probably can when connected to your TV via the Google Chromecast Plus. It goes $69-just ten dollars more than a Switch game, and it has an ethernet port for connecting directly to your router. That should help take some of the load off of your wireless network to ensure solid frame rates when streaming your favorite games. The Wired Options Apple Lightning Digital AV Adapter (iOS) Reliable wired options for iOS devices are few and far between. If you're using an iPhone your best bet is to shell out a few more bucks to Apple and buy the $49 official Lightning to HDMI adapter . Fortunately it also includes an additional USB-C port so you can power your device while it's connected to a TV using its Lightning port. Slimport MicroUSB to HDMI Adapter (Android) If you're using an older Android device that doesn't have a USB-C connection, you'll need this Slimport microUSB to HDMI adapter . You probably won't be able to push 4K resolution games to your TV, but at $7 it's a cheap and compact solution. Apple USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter (Android) The iPhone doesn't support USB-C just yet, but most of the Android smartphones released in the past year do. As do many laptops. So Apple's USB-C to HDMI adapter might be worth the $69 investment. When you're not using it to connect an Android smartphone to your TV for gaming, it also has a USB-A port for connecting older peripherals to your fancy new laptop. Monoprice USB-C to HDMI & USB-C Dual Port Adapter (Android) If you'd rather not pay a premium for Apple's products (that's fair), and only ever intend to use your adapter with a smartphone, Monoprice's USB-C solution gives you the important basics, including an HDMI port, and an extra USB-C port for charging, for just $20. Games This is where your makeshift smartphone Switch can run laps around Nintendo's console-at least in terms of selection. At the moment, the best reasons to buy a Nintendo Switch are Zelda: Breath of the Wild , and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe . That's just two games . They both happen to be very good games, but the iTunes App Store and the Google Play store both have thousands of titles you can download, and plenty that are actually good. But which platform offers the better gaming experience? Apple's walled garden approach to its app store means you're less likely to get fooled buying a knock-off game. Its MFi certification program also ensures that if a controller says 'Made for iPhone' on the packaging, it's guaranteed to connect and work with your phone right out of the box. Not all iOS games will work with a MFi-approved controller , however, and using a generic Bluetooth gamepad with your iPhone is hit and miss. Advertisement Advertisement Android smartphones, on the other hand, have access to the Google Play store, which is like the wild west when it comes to content. Anything and everything goes, and you can probably find exactly what you need if you know where to look. That includes games, apps for remapping the buttons on a Bluetooth controller so it works flawlessly with any title, and emulators. Part of the appeal of recent Nintendo consoles has been the company's Virtual Console which allows you to play classic NES, SNES, and Game Boy games on modern hardware. But with the right emulator , Android smartphones can play classic games from countless different consoles, including the Atari 2600, Playstation, Game Boy Advance, PSP, PS2, and even the Game Cube . As for finding those games (commonly referred to as ROMs) that's between you and a strategic Google search. Can you play games like Zelda: Breath of the Wild or Mario Kart 8 Deluxe on your smartphone yet? No. So the Nintendo Switch will always be able to hold that over your smartphone FrankenSwitch. But you just saved yourself $300+, and having to wait in yet another line hoping that Best Buy has restocked enough of them.

Skip to content 512 Pixels About Projects Sponsor Book → RSS → A Little Less Innovation, Perhaps » May 6, 2017 ⌘ Permalink Dan Moren, writing at Macworld: Apple was so concerned about transforming the 2013 edition of the Mac Pro into an elegant, radical piece of machinery that it lost sight of what made that product appeal to its users. In a rare moment, the company even admitted it had taken the wrong approach. But what about Apple’s portable Macs? With this week’s announcement of Microsoft’s Surface Laptop—of which there is very little that’s radical—it seems as though Apple’s notebooks may have missed a beat by being too focused on pushing the envelope. Maybe what we’re looking for is a faster horse. The lack of a good, updated Mac notebook at the $999 price point sure seems silly to me.

It was reported that the proposed plant might be operational perhaps between April and June.

By: Bloomberg | San Francisco | Published:May 6, 2017 8:32 pm Bosch may supply as much as half of these components for the new iPhone, with InvenSense supplying the rest. ( Source: Bloomberg) Robert Bosch GmbH has won orders from Apple Inc. to supply the next iPhone with some of its motion sensors, according to a person familiar with the deal, a potential blow to InvenSense Inc., currently the main supplier of those smartphone components.The change — hinted at by InvenSense’s finance chief in August — comes as the San Jose, California-based maker of motion-sensing chips seeks to complete its $1.3 billion sale to TDK Corp., a deal partly aimed at boosting the Japanese company’s business with Apple. Bosch may supply as much as half of these components for the new iPhone, with InvenSense supplying the rest, the person said. Bosch already supplies barometric pressure sensors for the iPhone, according to product teardowns by iFixit and other firms that analyze the guts of gadgets. Representatives for Apple, InvenSense and Bosch declined to comment. TDK didn’t respond to requests for comment outside of normal business hours in Japan. InvenSense shares were trading 0.3 percent lower at $12.85 as of 12:10 p.m. in New York, paring earlier losses. The TDK takeover is for $13 per share.”People believe that the acquisition is going to go through,” said Tristan Gerra, an analyst at Robert W. Baird, who rates InvenSense neutral. “The share loss scenario may be something that TDK had already considered.” Rather than an existing revenue stream from supplying Apple, TDK may be more interested in InvenSense’s suite of technologies suited to growth areas like driverless cars, drones and the internet of things.The risks of losing Apple as a customer were recently highlighted by chip developer Imagination Technologies Plc., which said in April that the iPhone maker would stop using its intellectual property within two years. The U.K. company’s stock plunged as much as 69 percent.

Analysts expect consumers to buy millions of the new gadgets, generating huge orders for component suppliers. The components produced by Bosch and InvenSense contain gyroscopes and accelerometers. Gyroscopes can tell if a phone is being held horizontally or vertically, being shaken, or pointing in a particular direction. An accelerometer detects different movements, such as side-to-side motion. Together, the sensors help measure step count, and they’re useful for mobile games and augmented reality applications. In the iPhone 6S and iPhone 7, these were supplied exclusively by InvenSense, according to teardowns. InvenSense Chief Financial Officer Mark Dentinger said at an August investor conference that as recently as 2014 it was dominant “by a considerable margin” at the top end of the smartphone market.”We’re still the largest player, but we are splitting some share now with our primary competitor,” he added. “Historically, it’s unlikely that most of our customers will have just one supplier over a long, long period of time.” Also Read: Apple encryption row: FBI paid $900,000 to hack into San Bernardino shooter’s iPhone TDK, which rose to prominence on cassette tapes in the 1970s, has since expanded into batteries, automotive components and now the Internet of Things.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Highlights From Twitter's and Amazon's Q1 Earnings Twitter beat guidance and showed strong growth in its most recent quarter. Is that enough to start talking about a turnaround? Plus, we review Amazon's awesome earnings release. Evan Niu, CFA and Dylan Lewis (TMFNewCow) May 6, 2017 at 9:45AM Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) reported earnings last week, and both companies' shares climbed on their results. On this tech episode of Industry Focus, Motley Fool analyst Dylan Lewis is joined by senior tech specialist Evan Niu to dive into both companies' earnings reports and key investor takeaways. Tune in to find out the most important numbers from each report, what Twitter's biggest concerns are going forward and how it's addressing them, which unlikely segment is accounting for the majority of Amazon's profits, how Amazon is investing in the long game in international markets like India, and more. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on April 28, 2017.  Dylan Lewis: Welcome to Industry Focus, the podcast that dives into a different sector of the stock market every day. It's Friday, April 28. Welcome to earnings season, folks! I'm your host, Dylan Lewis, and I'm joined on Skype by fool.com senior tech specialist Evan Niu. Evan, it is the most wonderful time of the quarter. How's it going? Evan Niu: Pretty good. Ready for the weekend. It's been a busy earnings week. Lewis: Yeah. A lot to catch up on this week, and obviously, looking forward to next week as well, with a lot of big tech companies, namely Apple, reporting. But, this most recent week, two big names, Amazon and Twitter, both reported. We're going to go through their quarterly reports today. Evan, why don't we start out with the e-commerce giant? Niu: Sure. Lewis: Looking at Amazon's report here, they put up $35.7 billion in revenue. A year ago, $29 billion. That's a 23% increase year over year. That's pretty incredible given the size they're working on with that denominator for year-over-year changes. Down to EPS, $1.48 per share. Based on last year, $1.07, good for 39% increase year over year. When it comes down to it, the company really crushed Wall Street's expectations and their own estimates. Niu: Yeah, I think it was a pretty strong quarter. The same thing we've been seeing play out over the past year-plus. Amazon Web Services continues to really crush it. This AWS segment is so important at this point financially, because it's so much more profitable than the e-commerce businesses. Plus, on top of that, operating margins for AWS is expanding, so they're starting to see some operating leverage kick in. Whereas the e-commerce businesses, both North America and international, saw operating margins decline a little bit. AWS is now approaching 25% operating margins, compared to 2% to 3% in North American e-commerce, and negative in international. And that's only going to get more pronounced over time as AWS continues to grow, continues to scale, and continues to be even more and more increasingly important, financially speaking, to their bottom line. Lewis: A couple numbers on the company's cloud computing division, AWS. Sales were up 43% year over year. AWS accounted for 10% of Amazon's total sales in the quarter, which was up from just under 9% in the year-ago period. Like you were saying, investors should be thrilled to see AWS continue to become a larger part of the company's top line, because it is a much higher-margin business than the company's e-commerce efforts. E-commerce is, by nature, razor-thin, particularly the way that Amazon does it. So, when you have a cash cow business like AWS, to highlight the margin differential here, that segment produced more operating income than Amazon's North American division on roughly one-sixth the sales. Which is insane. Niu: Yeah. I think it's funny. Amazon has always been considered a tech company, but I would argue that's only recently become an appropriate description. E-commerce, yeah, you're doing online, but the cost structure doesn't scale in the way that most tech companies do scale. That's one of the big advantages for a lot of tech companies, that they can really scale up into these really high levels and profits just start expanding. But when you have e-commerce, it's just not that way, because the infrastructure investments are massive, the margins are, like you mentioned, very small to begin with. I think when they jumped into this AWS thing a few years ago, obviously cloud infrastructure is pure tech, and it's also very scalable, which is also another thing that's common in tech. I just think it's interesting how, historically, they've always been considered a tech company, when their operations have been less tech-focused, especially in terms of the cost structure compared to this new cloud business, which is just exploding and blowing up everywhere. Lewis: And that cloud business has really allowed them to invest in other parts of the business. We mentioned the losses that are going on in the international side right now. That segment posted 16% year-over-year growth. It's still operating at a loss. The reason for that is, they're sinking a ton of money into long-term investments on that side. You can think about what they're doing with e-commerce and building out warehouses, that fulfillment infrastructure. They're investing in content and having original programming that's bespoke to all the markets they're entering, launching Prime in India, all these different things that are long-term plays, that's all enabled by the fact that AWS is creating a ton of money for them.   Niu: Definitely. Speaking of India, I think that was a big contributor. International operating margins declined from -1% to -4%. So, you see losses widening on the international side. In the earnings release, they talked a lot about India. They mentioned India many times. They mentioned they're making localized content and TV shows for the Indian market. I think they invested, at this point, somewhere in the neighborhood of $5 billion in infrastructure in India. Jeff Bezos even said, it's still "day one" for e-commerce in India. So, clearly, Amazon sees a lot of potential in the Indian market, and that's where they're directing a lot of their investments. But, they did talk about it an awful lot in the press release, so you can certainly see that it's at the top of their mind. Lewis: Yeah. We talked about that "day one." That was something that also came up in Jeff Bezos' annual letter to shareholders -- if any Fools haven't read it, I highly recommend it, it's great insight into the leadership of Amazon and how the company is thinking about things. You see a lot of that reflected in how they're handling that international segment. Pulling back and looking broadly at the company, and looking for investor takeaways here, I think you have to chalk this up to a killer quarter from a great company. A lot of stuff that we expected. AWS, it's great to see it continuing to grow and become a more important part of the business. We love that. But what we're seeing on the international side, yes, would it be nice if it wasn't operating at a loss? Yeah. But the long-term investments are probably going to bear fruit for the company in the future. Anything else on Amazon for you, Evan? Niu: I remember a few years back, I was having a conversation with Eric Bleeker, he used to be a general manager at Fool.com and has moved to a different part of the company. Bleeker was telling me, we were having this conversation a couple years ago and he was saying it might be worth it to invest in Amazon purely just for AWS. This was at a time when AWS was much smaller, and Amazon wasn't even disclosing their results yet, so it was hard to know how important it was. But I wish I had taken him up on that. The stock has more than doubled since that time, largely driven by AWS. So, it is pretty breathtaking how AWS has become so fundamental to the investing case. It would have been hard to predict five years ago, but it's so important now. Lewis: Yeah. I mentioned Jeff Bezos' annual letter before. Actually, we had a writer, Seth McNew, look at Jeff Bezos' annual letter from 10 years ago, and he talks about AWS. So, I mention the importance of reading these letters as getting a lens into how management thinking, and what eventually might become very important parts of the business, and why they're funneling money into these different projects. I think that's an example where Bezos had the vision a long time ago that this was going to be super important for Amazon. Bleeker caught on at some point, too. But, it wound up being huge for investors, huge for the company, and it's really fueled a lot of the growth that they're looking for in other segments. Niu: Yeah. I wish I could have invested in just the AWS business. Lewis: [laughs] Gotta love those margins. So Evan, flipping from a company that has been on fire for years in a positive way to, maybe, a company that's been on fire in more of a negative sense, let's talk a little bit about Twitter and their most recent report. Revenue came in at just under $550 million, which beat expectations. But even with that beat, the top line was still down from nearly $600 million that the company brought in at the first quarter a year ago. Looking over at the bottom line, non-GAAP EPS came in at $0.11. Of course, if you're looking at the generally accepted accounting principals side of the financials, the company lost $0.09 per share. I think in some ways, this is the quarter that Twitter desperately needed. It was the first set of good news for the company in a while. They had the beat on some financial numbers, and they also had some core business numbers that looked pretty rosy. The stock is up over 10% since the report. Obviously a lot of people like what they saw. Looking at the results, Evan, what stuck out to you? Niu: I think the key theme for this quarter was cost-cutting, which really helped profitability. Not that they're profitable on a GAAP basis. But in general, it certainly helps their financial position. If you remember, they announced in late 2016 that they are restructuring and laying off 9% of their staff. That's certainly a big driver of these big cost reductions. For example, revenue is down 8%, but total costs were down 10%. You can see that translates into a little bit of margin expansion, which is funny, it's almost like reverse operating leverage, if you can get margins to expand while revenue is going down. But, I think it's an interesting thing. This is an argument I've been making recently. Before Q1, this quarter, Twitter has been operating unsustainably because they have consistently large net losses, deteriorating operating metrics, most notably around users. But meanwhile, revenue has been growing for most of the time, so it makes it more acceptable. But if you have net losses, declining sales, and poor operating metrics, that's just a really bad recipe. This quarter being the first-ever revenue decline, but the silver lining is they helped their profitability a little bit. I think of it kind of like inflection points. Sales went down, but this is their highest EBITDA margin they've ever posted.  I think, in a way, Twitter has to accept what it is, and more importantly what it isn't. It's definitely carved out place for itself at the intersection of social media news, microblogging, and interacting with people or public figures that you might not know personally. But there are limits to how far that usage can take Twitter in that role. Frankly, overinvesting in future growth could be a waste of money because I think the platform does lack some mainstream appeal, which is what we've seen manifest itself over the years, in terms of poor user growth. This quarter was the strongest user growth they've had in two years, so there are things that are turning up, and engagement is improving. They're stabilizing their financials and right-sizing the cost structure. I think they're more surgically investing in product improvements. And, obviously, the goal of that is to improve user engagement and growth. But I think what they're doing really bodes well in terms of financial sustainability, because they can support themselves. They brought in $550 million in sales. You can sustain a business on that, if you're bringing in that much money each quarter, so long as you have some cost discipline, you're not overinvesting and chasing things that won't ever materialize. So, I do think this was an important quarter for them. Lewis: Yeah. Looking beyond those financial numbers, you mentioned what's going on with users. They're now at 328 million monthly active users worldwide, which is up 9 million sequentially. That's really great to see. We've been looking at this stagnating user growth for quite some time, so it's great to see them notch what amounts to a meaningful bump here. I think it's the strongest sequential addition they've had in two years, back when they reported something like 14 million in Q1 2015. What do you think is really pushing those gains, Evan? Because they've been doing so much on the platform to improve engagement and get people logging in more often and engaging with the platform more. They've been doing a huge push with live-streaming and getting some programming there. They've been experimenting with push notifications. They've been rethinking the company's timeline approach. Rather than having it be just sequential and based on recency, they try to curate content a little bit more. Do you think there's any one thing that's really getting people more engaged? Niu: I think it's a combination. They mentioned on that call a couple of factors. One is, in the U.S. particularly, there's been a big rise in political engagement, so people following and interacting with political-related content. Which makes sense, given the current political climate. It's kind of a crazy climate, so people are getting more engaged. But the hard part is, it doesn't seem like that's translating into ad sales, necessarily, which is the next step of that equation. And like you mentioned, the algorithmic curation. It's funny, they announced that a year ago, and Twitter users freaked out, they were like, "You're just trying to become Facebook." Lewis: Yeah, that was not a popular decision, when they decided to do that. Niu: Yeah, they got so much backlash. I don't understand why these really enthusiastic Twitter users were so upset about this. Compared to a strictly unfiltered reverse chronological feed, which is hard to use unless you're literally constantly on there and you'll see everything in real time, which, no one does that -- Lewis: And, also, because of Twitter's platform, there's so much noise. Having a reverse chronological feed sets you up to look at a lot of stuff you just don't want to see. Niu: Exactly. Thinking about it fundamentally, the point of having algorithmic curation is to unearth content and tweets that are more relevant to you as a user, based on your behavior and data around what you interact with. Shouldn't any social media user of any platform want more relevant content? I just don't understand how that is some terrible thing to some of the people who really spoke out against this. I mean, it's very likely that it's just a very vocal minority that was making a big fuss about this. It's obviously helped. More relevant tweets helps engagement. You don't have to waste as much of your time trying to find the information or content you're looking for, if Twitter is going to help you with that process and showing you information you might be interested in. And they've introduced a lot of features with that idea in mind. It's definitely helping, clearly. Lewis: One of the numbers we can look at for that -- and they don't break it out specifically for us, but we can glean it from growth rates -- is how daily active users compare to monthly active users. I know this is something that you've written a little bit about on fool.com. Seeing daily active rise 14% year over year, while monthly actives were up 7% year over year, that says that people are generally coming back to the platform more, even as monthlies are growing. Niu: Exactly. This is the fourth or fifth quarter of daily active user growth accelerating. The growth rate has been trending higher over the past year. Again, over the past year is when they've been innovating these product changes, particularly with the algorithmic curation. I don't know if they're making much progress on the whole abuse side of it. That's always been a big problem, and they always say they're doing stuff to help, and they always say they're making progress. And there's no really good way to measure this. It's not like there's metrics around abuse. [laughs] At least, maybe internally they have some metrics they follow. But as far as public investors go, it's not like we can look at some hard number and see that abuse is going down. So you just have to take their word for it. But their word on this topic doesn't really have a lot of weight because they've had this long history of being way too passive when it comes to abuse and harassment on their platform. They said that making progress there has also helped engagement. But, again, I think it's probably more about the other factors, because I don't give them too much credit about actually fighting abuse, because they seem a little too complacent there. Lewis: Right. Beyond the user side, switching over to the ad side of their business, I think on first glance, one of the things that was a "yikes" moment in the results was, even with all these positive trends -- more daily actives outstripping the monthly active growth, and general positive growth trends in monthly actives -- cost per ad engagement was down 60% year over year, and that's on the back of a 50% decline a year ago. Generally, in the past, the company has been able to make up for those declines based on the volume of ad engagements. Even with ad engagements up 140% year over year in this most recent quarter, they still posted the revenue decline, because that price is coming down and down. This is something that you have to be a little bit concerned about. At the end of the day, the user growth is only so good as long as they can monetize those users. Niu: Yeah, exactly. I think that's exactly the challenges they face now. Jack Dorsey has certainly always been a more product-focused CEO. The product improvements are helping the user numbers, but as far as financials go. For example, they mentioned that engagement had the biggest gains in the U.S., in part because of the political stuff we mentioned. They're seeing the biggest gains and engagement in the U.S. But ad revenue declined the most in the U.S. So, there's a big disconnect there between these things. These things are diverging. Growth is down, engagement is up. How do you reconcile those two things? That's what they're trying to focus on next. "Once we stabilize the user number, then we focus on the ads." And they're trying to streamline their ad products, because I think they had a little bit too much going on. They're trying to be more efficient and targeted with how they're approaching the ad business. It's definitely what they need to hit next. Right now, there's a big discrepancy between engagement and ad sales. So, whether or not they could do that, that's a pretty big, open-ended question, in terms of results going forward. Lewis: To a certain extent, I think that's just the dynamics of the ad business. In the quarterly call, CFO Anthony Noto tried to explain what was going on here by saying, "Current revenue trends we are reporting reflect budget decisions based on trends in audience and pricing of 6-12 months ago, and we're not seeing significant acceleration in user growth." Really, what he's getting at here is, ad budgets are planned out, so any increase in ad spend or anything that would impact the rates that people are paying on Twitter or the number of impressions, anything like that, it's going to be a reflection of what user growth looks like six months prior, basically. In the company's PR, in their guidance, they said Twitter continues to expect advertising revenue growth to continue to meaningfully lag that of audience growth in 2017. Including into the second quarter. So, if you're looking for a period where we might start to see these metrics sync up a little bit more, and start seeing what people are paying for ads on Twitter reflect what's going on with the audience growth they're experiencing, it probably happens sometime in the fall of 2017. That's the mark-your-calendar period for investors if you're watching these two metrics. Niu: Yeah, I definitely agree with that. There's a little bit of a lag time there. But, hopefully they can actually start executing better on the ad side. But even beyond that, the cost bit is pretty important. I think they've been a little too generous with things like stock-based compensation, for example. They're expecting stock-based compensation in 2017 to be down about 20% to 25% versus 2016 levels, which I think is an encouraging sign. That's certainly one of their largest expenses. It's a non-cash expense, but it's still one of the biggest expenses on a GAAP basis, and they're still trying to hit GAAP profitability. They're still putting non-GAAP net income, but of course, investors prefer GAAP profits. Lewis: Absolutely. Niu: They have a lot of pieces of the puzzle to work on at the same time. And they're making progress on the user side and the product side and on the cost side. But they do need to be doing better on the ad side, on the revenue side. Lewis: We talked about some of the progress we're seeing here. Evan, are you buying into Twitter's turnaround story? A lot of the numbers here seem to be moving in the right direction. But I also see a lot of reasons for pause. Niu: I'm not really interested in Twitter as an investment. I do think they can become a sustainable business with a place in the world, and provide a service that provides value to people. But that doesn't necessarily mean they're going to be a good investment for public shareholders. You can have a solid company that can operate and be sustainable and still underperform the broader market. Those two things are certainly quite common and not mutually exclusive. I think Twitter is on its path to becoming more of a long-term company, in terms of how it's being run, and holding down its place that it's carved out for itself. And while a lot of these metrics are improving and heading in the right direction, it's just one quarter. I still don't think Twitter is going to be an outperforming investment, in which case, I'm not interested. Lewis: I'm kind of thinking along the same lines here. For me, this is a company that has been poorly managed for such a long time. There's been that revolving door of CEOs. They've gone through so many different platform identity crises. There was a period half a year ago when management was looking for a buyer for the business. Given all of that dysfunction, I think I need to see more before I'm really thinking about this as serious investment opportunity at all. It's great to see some of these metrics trending the right way. But I also really want to see if they can continue to sustain this user growth. We talked about how, to a certain extent, the current political environment is something that is helping out the business a ton. Is that going to be short-lived? Long-lived? Will major changes to the platform continue to fuel what they're seeing on the user side? There are a lot of questions, and I need more solid answers and metrics to hang my hat on before I give them a serious look. Niu: Right. And something you mentioned a minute ago, in terms of the changing product direction and revolving-door CEOs, I think if you haven't already, and any listeners also, you should check out Hatching Twitter by Nick Bilton. It came out a couple years ago in 2013 or 2014. It's not a new book. But it gives a really good account of Twitter's founding and the early days and how much in fighting and backstabbing and betrayal there was in those early days. Between Jack Dorsey and Evan Williams, two of the co-founders who had a constant power struggle. But, to your point, they each had different vision for the products. I think if you read the story, it really gives you some context into why Twitter has always seemed to lack direction as a company and a product. It's really useful, really good for investors to get that context of the culture that Twitter grew up in, which kind of explains why it's still been so hard for them to figure out exactly where they fit in the world, because of these conflicting visions about the product very early on. I don't know if those types of culture concerns persist to this day. But it's a really interesting story, and I think some very useful context. I would highly recommend anyone who's interested in Twitter as a company, stock, or service, should go read the book. It's a pretty good book. Lewis: It's always nice to send the listeners home with some homework. That's the book on Twitter, Hatching Twitter, you said? Niu: Yeah, Hatching Twitter, it's written by Nick Bilton, who is a really prominent New York Times journalist, now rights for Vanity Fair. He did a really good job, and he had good access, too, he had access to all the co-founders, so really good first-hand accounts of how everything went down. A lot of betrayal and power-grabbing. Lewis: So, for more color on what we were talking about today, listeners, check out Hatching Twitter. I would also highly recommend checking out Jeff Bezos' annual letter to shareholders if you haven't already. Awesome discussion. Evan, anything else before I let you go? Niu: No, I think we covered it all. Lewis: All right. We'll definitely be back next week to talk some major tech earnings. But, until then, that does it for this episode of Industry Focus.

May 6, 2017 WSP At the recent Microsoft EDU event held in New York City, Microsoft’s corporate vice president for Surface Computing, Panos Panay, unveiled what could be one of the company’s best creations ever — a hybrid of the Surface Book laptop and the Surface Pro tablet minus a detachable keyboard: the new Surface Laptop. Scheduled to debut on June 15 at a price tag of $999, the laptop weighs 2.76 lbs., measures 14.55mm thick, and comes in four colors, namely — burgundy, cobalt blue, graphite gold and platinum. It features a 13.5-inch screen, with a resolution of 2256 x 1504 ppi, a 3:2 aspect ratio, and a touchscreen display. It comes with a fabric-covered keyboard that feels unusually warm to the touch (and might take a little getting used to, though in a positive way). Being part of the Surface family, the device works with the Surface Pen (which allows the user to draw on the screen), the Surface Dial and all other standard Windows accessories. On its right side, you’ll find its power connector and a Surface Connect port that allows Surface Dock expansion. On its left, you’ll find a headphone jack, a regular USB 3.0 port, and a Mini DisplayPort. On its bottom under the keyboard are its speakers. There’s no USB-C port, though. Which is kind of surprising and maybe a little bit disappointing considering that most new high-end laptops that come out in the market today already offer this as a standard feature. The laptop is powered by an Intel Core i5 processor with 4 GB of RAM, 128 GB SSD (solid state drive) storage and Intel HD Graphics 620. Its high-end version, on the other hand, features an Intel Core i7 processor, 16 GB of RAM, 512 GB SSD storage, and Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640. Double-power specs mean a higher price, of course — $2199. The device runs on Windows 10 S, a version of Windows 10 that’s designed to load faster and demand less from its hardware. It’s also restricted to running apps downloaded exclusively from the Windows Store, which means that traditional desktop apps can only run on the device if they’re specially packaged to work with it, or if the user opts to upgrade to Windows 10 Professional. According to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), its battery will last up to 14.5 hours, and that if you put the device to sleep, then resume working on it a few days later, it will be just like you left it — with no amount of battery loss whatsoever. It’s quite a bold claim, especially in light of the recent report released by British testing publication ‘Which?’, basically saying that most laptop manufacturers’ battery life claims are overstated. But if the Surface Laptop does manage to last 14 hours like Microsoft is claiming, then kudos to the software giant for achieving quite an impressive feat. Based on what has been revealed about it so far, the Surface Laptop seems to be a formidable device that looks great on the outside, and is expected to operate well from the inside. It’s even priced reasonably too. As for its actual performance, we’ll know how it fares in about 2 months. In the meantime, you may watch this video released by Microsoft for a glimpse into what the Surface Laptop is all about.

Build Apps 5x Faster For Half the Cost Enterprise Cloud Computing On Force.com Smart Machines To Recover Lost Memories, Mind Your Children By Glenn Chapman PUBLISHED: MAY 06 2017 Intelligent machines of the future will help restore memory, mind your children, fetch your coffee and even care for aging parents. It will all be part of a brave new world of the not-so-distant future, in which innovative smart machines, rather than being the undoing of people -- as some technophobes have long feared -- actually enhance humans. Many expert say technology will allow people to take on tasks they might only have dreamed of in the past. "Super-intelligence should give us super-human abilities," said Tom Gruber, head of the team responsible for Apple's Siri digital assistant, during an on-stage talk at the prestigious TED Conference. Smarter Machines, Smarter Humans "As machines get smarter, so do we," Gruber said. "Artificial intelligence can enable partnerships where each human on the team is doing what they do best," he told the popular technology conference. Gruber, a co-creator of Siri and artificial intelligence research at Apple, told of being drawn to the field three decades ago by the potential for technology to meet people's needs. "I am happy to see that the idea of an intelligent personal assistant is mainstream," he said. Now he has taken his innovative approach to smart machines, and is turning the thinking about the technology on its head. "Instead of asking how smart we can make our machines, let's ask how smart our machines can make us," Gruber said. Already smart technology is taking hold, with popular digital assistants like Apple's Siri, created Gruber. South Korean giant Samsung created Bixby to break into a surging market for voice-activated virtual assistants, which includes Amazon's Alexa, Google's Assistant and Microsoft's Cortana. Amazon appears to have impacted the sector the most with its connected speakers using Alexa. The service allows users a wide range of voice interactions for music, news, purchases and connects with smart home devices. Remembering Everything Gruber envisions artificial intelligence -- AI -- getting even more personal, perhaps augmenting human memory. "Human memory is famously flawed -- like, where did the 1960s go and can I go there too?" Gruber quipped. He spoke of a future in which artificial intelligence remembers everyone met during a lifetime and details of everything someone read, heard, said or did. "From the tiniest clue it could help you retrieve anything you've seen or heard before," he said. "I believe AI will make personal memory enhancement a reality; I think it's inevitable." Such memories would need to be private, with people choosing what to keep, and be kept absolutely secure, he maintained. Surefooted Robots Boston Dynamics robotics company founder Marc Raibert was at TED with a four-legged SpotMini robot nimble enough to frolic amid the conference crowd. He smiled but would not comment when asked by AFP about the potential to imbue program the gadget with the kind of artificial intelligence described by fellow speakers. Raibert did, however, note that the robots are designed to be compatible with new "user interfaces." Current virtual assistants have been described as a step into an era of controlling computers by speaking instead of typing or tapping screens. "I think it won't be too long before we're using robots to take care of our parents, or help our children take care of us," Raibert said from the TED Talk. The 'Gorilla Problem' Not everyone at TED embraced the idea of a future in which machines are smarter and more capable than humans, however. Stuart Russell, a University of California at Berkeley computer sciences professor, referred to the situation as the "gorilla problem" in that when smarter humans came along it boded ill for evolutionary ancestors. "This queasy feeling that making something smarter than your own species is not a good idea," said Russell, co-author of the book Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach. As an AI researcher he supported research in the technology. However, he urged programming machines with robotic laws of behavior, in a shrewd spin on work of science fiction author Isaac Asimov. He gave the example of a robot being told to simply fetch coffee. A machine not constrained by proper principles might decide that accomplishing the task required it to defend against being shut down and remove all obstacles from its path by whatever means necessary. Russell counseled robot principles including altruism, humility, and making a priority of human values. "You are probably better off with a machine that is like this," Russell said. "It is a first step in human compatibility with AI." © 2017 The Peninsula under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media. All rights reserved. Image credit: iStock.

Tech Prodigy Re-Routes Self-Driving Next Article > Alibaba Billionaire: AI Will Cause More Pain than Happiness By Olivia Solon PUBLISHED: APRIL 26 2017 Artificial intelligence and other technologies will cause people "more pain than happiness" over the next three decades, according to Jack Ma, the billionaire chairman and founder of Alibaba. "Social conflicts in the next three decades will have an impact on all sorts of industries and walks of life," said Ma [pictured above], speaking at an entrepreneurship conference in China about the job disruptions that would be created by automation and the internet. A key social conflict will be the rise of artificial intelligence and longer life expectancy, which will lead to an aging workforce fighting for fewer jobs. Ma, who is usually more optimistic in his presentations, issued the warning to encourage businesses to adapt or face problems in the future. He said that 15 years ago he gave hundreds of speeches warning about the impact of e-commerce on traditional retailers and few people listened because he wasn’t as well-known as he is now. "Machines should only do what humans cannot," he said. "Only in this way can we have the opportunities to keep machines as working partners with humans, rather than as replacements." Even so, Ma acknowledged that in the future companies will likely be run by robots. "Thirty years later, the Time magazine cover for the best CEO of the year very likely will be a robot," he said. Robots can make calculations more quickly and rationally than humans, Ma added, and won’t be swayed by emotions, for example by getting angry at competitors. Leaders who don’t understand that cloud computing and artificial intelligence are essential for business should identify young people in their companies to explain it to them, he said. His comments echo a number of studies suggesting that automation will eliminate jobs, including a Forrester study that suggested 6% of all jobs in the US would be eliminated by 2021. The job displacement will start with customer service representatives and eventually move to truck and taxi drivers, the report read. Current technologies in this field include virtual assistants such as Alexa, Cortana, Siri and Google Now as well as chatbots and automated robotic systems. For now they are quite simple, but over the next five years they will become much better at making decisions on our behalf in more complex scenarios, which will enable mass adoption of breakthroughs such as self-driving cars. © 2017 Guardian Web under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

Nintendo Announces New 2DS XL 3. Facebook's Goals: Brain, Body Hacks 4. FB Aims To Build Community via AR 5. Ex-MS Managers Take on LinkedIn Next Article > Nintendo Announces 2DS XL, And Doesn't Care About Your Rules By Keith Stuart PUBLISHED: MAY 02 2017 It seems as though Nintendo is trolling the entire games industry. Two months ago it launched the Switch, a strange hybrid of portable device and home console that everyone thought was filling a market gap that didn't exist. It has now shipped almost 3m units, making it the company's most successful roll-out since the Wii. It was thought that the Switch may well replace Nintendo's dedicated line of handheld consoles, or at least delay a new iteration. But no. The ever-unpredictable hardware veteran has announced the Nintendo 2DS XL [pictured above], a new version of the 2DS, which was itself a refreshed version of the 3DS. Featuring two enlarged displays, 4.88in on top and 4.18in on the bottom, and a clamshell design, the new format is lighter than the 3DS XL and of course lacks that machine's stereoscopic capabilities. Available in black and turquoise or white and orange and with built-in NFC support for amiibo cards and figures, it's a fully featured member of the extended 3DS family, even featuring the secondary C-pad nub like the 3DS XL. While the original 3DS launched in 2011 with the express purpose of providing stereoscopic 3D visuals, users soon found that few titles exploited the capabilities of the hardware in interesting ways. Furthermore, there were concerns at the time that children under seven should not be using the 3D feature set. In October 2013 a cheaper 2DS version arrived, removing the stereoscopic feature and the clamshell form factor, making the device more affordable for kids. Meanwhile, 2012 saw the arrival of a 3DS XL, offering a larger screen, which was replaced in 2015 by the New 3DS XL offering the new C-pad controller and other slight improvements. Deep breath. What the 2DS XL shows is both Nintendo's commitment to the DS line, which many thought would be quietly sunsetted in the Switch era, and its admirable commitment to somewhat eccentric and seemingly sudden hardware release plans. This is all taking place in a period where the company has announced the discontinuation of its acclaimed Mini NES, a condensed yet faithful recreation of its classic 1983 home console complete with 30 titles and HDMI support. The console was always undersupplied, leading to massive demand and skyrocketing prices on eBay. Other manufacturers may have responded by increasing production -- but not Nintendo. In April it revealed the line would be shut down in the US and Europe, though it's not clear whether the Japanese version is also halting production. This has led to speculation that we should expect the announcement of a Mini SNES, a similarly reduced version of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, which arrived in 1990 and arguably became the most beloved console of all time. Nintendo is not saying anything -- at least not yet. So now Nintendo is supporting one hybrid of a portable and home console, a 3DS XL (and technically the original 3DS and the New 3DS XL), and the 2DS, and the 2DS XL. And maybe at least one rebooted mini console. This time next month we can probably expect the rebirth of the Game & Watch series and a version of the NES robot add-on ROB complete with Alexa-style artificial intelligence. No matter how clever it is, though, it still won't be able to predict Nintendo's hardware strategy. © 2017 Guardian Web under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media. All rights reserved.

(NASDAQ: AAPL) was at first deemed a disappointment, but after analysts had a closer look at it they were very positive on the stock. Although, it is hard to be negative on the best performing Dow Jones Industrial Average stock of 2017. 24/7 Wall St. has compiled many analyst notes on Apple after the earnings report. We have included some highlights from the earnings report, as well as what analysts said afterward. The iPhone giant said that it had $2.10 in earnings per share (EPS) and $52.9 billion in revenue, versus consensus estimates from Thomson Reuters that called for $2.02 in EPS and revenue of $52.97 billion. In the same period of last year, Apple posted EPS of $1.90and $50.56 billion in revenue. In terms of its products, Apple reported as follows: iPhones: Shipped 50.76 million units with revenues totaling $33.25 billion, compared with 51.19 million units last year and $32.86 billion in revenue. iPads: Shipped 8.92 million units with revenues of $3.89 billion, versus 10.25 million units and $4.41 billion in revenue. Macs: Sold 4.20 million units with revenues of $5.84 billion in revenue, versus 4.03 million units and $5.11 billion in revenue. Services: Posted $7.04 billion in revenue, up from $5.99 billion year over year. In terms of guidance for the fiscal-third quarter, the company expects to see revenues in the range of $43.5 billion to $45.5 billion with a gross margin of 37.5% to 38.5%. The consensus estimates are $1.62 in EPS and $45.57 billion in revenue for the current quarter. Merrill Lynch’s Wamsi Mohan reiterated a Buy rating and $155 price objective. The firm noted some overhangs from Qualcomm and from margins, but the investment rationale said this: We rate Apple a Buy on potential upside from 1) Continued long-term opportunity in China, 2) potential share gains from the release of a lower-end iPhone, 3) strength in the upcoming iPhone 8 cycle, 4) optionality in cash balance, revenue sources like Apple Pay, Apple Watch, home/health kit, etc., that will take time to mature. Credit Suisse reiterated its Outperform rating and kept its $170 price target. The firm noted that the iPhone super-cycle is just around the corner. The firm’s Kulbinder Garcha noted that Apple’s services thesis remains intact and that Apple’s capital return was raised as expected — Apple increased the capital return program by $50 billion to some $300 billion by March 2019. FBN Securities reiterated its Outperform rating, but its Shebly Seyrafi raised Apple’s price target to $160 from $155. The report noted that Other (which includes the Apple Watch) revenue grew by 31% and was 27% above consensus. Also cited was that iPad and Mac beat consensus, while Apple’s services continues to grow well. Here’s what a handful of other analysts were saying about Apple after the report: Argus reiterated an Outperform rating with a $160 price target. Deutsche Bank reiterated a Hold rating but raised its price target to $130 from $125. Morgan Stanley reiterated an Overweight rating with a $161 price target. Piper Jaffray reiterated an Overweight rating and raised its price target to $158 from $155. BTIG reiterated a Buy rating and raised its price target to $184 from $165. BMO Capital Markets reiterated a Buy rating with a $160 price target. Goldman Sachs reiterated a Buy rating and raised its price target to $164 from $150.

(NASDAQ: AAPL) added $5.31 last week (3.7%), posting a new 52-week high on Friday. The company remains the best-performing stock by a wide margin among the 30 equities that comprise the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). The company’s stock is up 28.61% year to date, well above second place Boeing’s 18.84% improvement. Apple reported earnings last Tuesday. Earnings per share of $2.10 and revenues of $52.9 billion were mostly in line with estimates of $2.02 in earnings per share and $52.97 billion in revenues. In the same period last year, Apple reported earnings per share of $1.90 and revenues of $50.56 billion. Apple shipped nearly 51 million iPhones in its second fiscal quarter, down by 430,000 year over year, but revenue was up from $32.86 billion to $33.25 billion. iPad shipments and revenues dropped while unit sales and revenues from Mac sales both rose. Services revenues rose by more than $1 billion year over year. Analysts uniformly maintained Buy ratings and some raised their price targets. Check out our full review of analyst action, but here are a few highlights: Merrill Lynch reiterated a Buy rating and $155 price target. Credit Suisse reiterated a Buy rating and $170 price target. BTIG kept its Buy rating and raised its price target from $165 to $184. Cowen kept its Buy rating and raised its price target from $155 to $160. Apple shares closed at $148.96 on Friday, in a 52-week trading range of $89.47 to $148.98. The consensus 12-month price target is $148.95 in a price target range of $104 to $185 per share. Last week’s changes may not all be included in the consensus yet.

On Tuesday, Apple reported another increase in its cash holdings to a new record of $256.8 billion, 93 percent of which is overseas. Many analysts speculate Apple could soon bring back those profits if the Trump administration follows through on a proposed cut to the tax rate on those returning funds. Mergers and acquisitions "may make the most sense for some (or all) of Apple's excess cash" since Apple would likely take "too long" to use its cash for accelerating its pace of share repurchases, Citi's Jim Suva said in a Friday note. "We identified a handful of potential M&A targets. Three are media firms: Netflix, Disney (DIS) and Hulu. Three are video game developers: Activision (ATVI), Electronic Arts (EA) and Take-Two (TTWO). And, one is an auto maker: Tesla (TSLA). Each target confers some strategic benefit to Apple," Suva said. He has a buy rating on Apple. Investors in Apple could see as much as a 20 percent gain from an Apple acquisition of Disney, or 7 percent from a purchase of Tesla or Netflix, Suva said. The iPhone maker could also use part of the cash to increase buybacks, he said in the note, resulting in "a significant 20 percent lift" in the share price. Attractiveness of acquisition candidates (deal size, probability, impact to Apple shares) Source: Citi Research Apple did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment. Management said on the earnings call that it was difficult to speculate on what might happen on tax reform. The Citi report is also not the first time analysts have speculated about the tech giant buying companies like Netflix or Tesla. Suva's team of analysts found that Netflix was the most logical target after examining five factors: strategic fit, global scale, transaction size, few non-strategic assets and likely impact on Apple's share price. "Like Apple, Netflix is global, has no non-core assets (like Disney) and is disrupting the global video ecosystem. Apple could help accelerate this disruption," Suva said. Non-core assets refer to those not essential to a company's operations. To be sure, respected Wall Street academic on corporate valuations Aswath Damodaran told CNBC earlier this week that the best thing for the iPhone maker to do with the cash is "probably nothing." "Cash is not the problem. It's what they could do with the cash that could potentially be a problem," Damodaran said. "It can become a problem if people stop trusting management and you know what could cause people to stop trusting management? A big acquisition." The iPhone maker has also avoided large acquisitions. The only transaction over $1 billion during the last six years was a $3 billion purchase of Beats Electronics in 2014, according to the Citi report.

The list also includes other giants like Netflix, Walt Disney and Electronic Arts among others. | TIMESOFINDIA.COM | Updated: May 6, 2017, 06.21 PM IST Highlights Citigroup slates Tesla as one of Apple's potential takeovers Apple has $250 billion as cash hoard to invest. Tesla set to come out with its new Model 3 in JulyFile photo of Tesla Model 3. NEW DELHI: Tesla has been listed as one of the seven potential takeover targets for Apple Inc by Citigroup, as a way to put its cash hoard of more than $250 billion to work. The list also includes other giants like Netflix, Walt Disney and Electronic Arts among others. The forecast holds water as Tesla has recently overtaken General Motors to become the largest US based automaker in terms of market capitalization. While the company has faced losses in nine out of its last 10 quarters and has had just two profitable quarters in its history as a public company, it has market capitalization of around $50 billion and a share price of more than $300, and its stock has risen more than 40 per cent this year. The fact that Tesla sells only a tiny fraction of cars as compared to its competitors (76,000 as compared to General Motors' 10 million in 2016 sales figures for US) notwithstanding, this development has managed to attract a lot of investor interest. However, being an automaker, the onus eventually lies on the number of cars they are able to roll off their assembly lines. Also, with their newly announced Model 3 - which has already received almost 400,000 booking interests - on the cards, Tesla is in need of some credible investor support. Apart from resolving the teething problems of the new product, Tesla also needs to safeguard against cannibalization of sales of its pricier Model S. "We have seen some impact on Model S, as a function of people being confused that Model 3 is an improved version of Model S," said Tesla CEO Elon Musk, during the company's earnings conference call on May 3. Tesla also has plans to boost the number of retail, delivery and service locations by 30 per cent, and add its first company-owned body repair shops this year. At the same time, it will expand its network of third-party certified body shops, and add more than 100 mobile repair shops in the second quarter alone. Apple's potential interest in Tesla might turn out to a perfect win-win situation as it comes on the back of Musk's recent jibe on existing investors asking them to 'buy Ford stock' after they suggested adding of two new independent directors to Tesla's board, while Apple too is under pressure from its shareholders to hand over its cash hoard.

Society Economy Sport Arts & Showbiz Overview    News    Articles    Interviews  Calendar Invalid query Musk thinks automated software will make Tesla worth as much as Apple May 6, 2017 - 16:44 AMT PanARMENIAN.Net - Elon Musk thinks his robot software can make Tesla Inc. worth as much as Apple Inc. He has the chance to prove it very soon, MarketWatch reports. In three different facilities spread across America, Tesla’s TSLA, +4.36% robot-manufacturing prowess is about to show its worth. If Musk — who, to his credit, is building rockets that can land already — can accomplish his accelerated ambitions for automated manufacturing, Tesla would at least own a piece of the pipeline over Apple AAPL, +1.66% . Musk said in 2015 that Tesla could achieve a $700 billion market cap in 10 years, and he prefaced his reiteration Wednesday with, “I may be completely delusional.” When an analyst asked Musk to update his bold statement in an earnings call, the CEO said it would “heavily involve Tesla going at the machine that builds the machine.” “Which involves, by the way, a tremendous amount of software,” he explained. “This is not just a bunch of robots that are sitting there. It’s programming of the robots and how they interact. And it’s far more complex than the software in the car.” Musk is referencing the advanced machines that will produce the Tesla Model 3 and the batteries for it, an audacious attempt at becoming a major American manufacturer in a short time. Along with solar-panel manufacturing adopted in the SolarCity merger, Tesla is rolling out three new production lines in the coming months, planned for peak performance. The former NUMMI factory in Fremont, Calif., has undergone a rebuild and is projected to go from its current pace of building 100,000 cars a year to one that, by the end of 2018, could build 500,000 annually. Musk promised the aggressive schedule after receiving 373,000 reservations with a $1,000 deposit for the Model 3, which is expected to begin production in July as of now. The Model 3 is a lower-budget version of the Model S, and a main reason Tesla can afford to drop the price is the plans to manufacture its own batteries at the “Gigafactory” near Reno, Nev. The company said Tuesday that manufacturing machines, presumably with Tesla’s special-sauce software, are being installed in the facility, which Musk has said will exceed previous global lithium-ion battery production. The building itself is so large, it even boggles Musk’s brain. “I mean, you could put three Pentagons — more than three Pentagons — I think four Pentagons? I don’t know, a lot. Just in the Gigafactory,” he said in the call. Photo. REUTERS/James Glover II Related links: MarketWatch.

The LED lighting system is customizable with 16 million colors but you can also choose from 6 color presets.  Accompanied by Windows-only BlasterX Acoustic Engine Pro software, other Creative’s RGB-enabled peripherals will work alongside the Kratos S5.  The same software also handles 7.1 virtual surround sound.  As a 2.1 unit, the Karatos S5 comes with 4″ satellite drivers and 6.5″ down-firing subwoofer driver in enclosures made entirely out of wood for better resonance damping as well as optimized delivery of a warm and natural sound.  Last but not least is an audio control pod that provides convenient access to your choice of microphone and headset. JBL Pebbles Where Style is Everything (2013) JBL definitely thinks outside the box with the Pebbles – a pair of snail-lookalike USB speakers.  They are more just than conversation pieces as the unique design does serve a purpose.  You can either use them in a vertical or horizontal orientation.  More importantly, the tall but narrow profile allows for the large 50mm drivers to be located in the front while allowing a fairly large bass reflex zone in the rear.  This combination allows for a very large soundstage without losing fidelity but unfortunately, the Pebbles only support up to 16-bit 48kHz audio. Like many USB-powered speakers, all the electronics – USB DAC cable, as well as the volume knob – are located in the right speaker and the left plugs into it via a simple 3.5mm audio jack.  This means you can use either in monaural mode via either USB or analog connections and you will not need any special software to use them in either mode. As an added bonus, JBL includes a winding grove along the flat bottom of the right speaker for easy storage and transportation. Cubik’s HD USB Speakers for iOS and Android Alike (2013) For mobile devices, you usually have to buy a set of Bluetooth speakers.  If you are looking for HD audio solution and wireless option isn’t a must, then the Cubik HD USB speakers by Palo Alto have you covered regardless of what platform you have.  A single standard Type-A USB port on the back lets you connect to either a regular PC or a mobile device, whether it be a smartphone or tablet, for bit-by-bit lossless USB audio streaming. Everything works out of the box since mobile or desktop OS platform allows for universal compatibility.  The Cubik HD also sports a DAP which takes in a raw (up to) 24-bit 96kHz PCM stream and then does the necessary conversion on-board via a PULSUS PS8535-based controller.  Add in 2 high quality Denmark-designed Peerless speakers tilted so as to deliver room filling sound, and the Cubik HD might turn out to be a very promising speaker set in a downright small package. XtremeMac’s USB Soundbar for iMac (2013) 10 watts may sound pretty small if you are shopping for a home stereo in the hundreds of Watts range. XtremeMac manages to pack a whopping four speakers in its Tango Bar mini sound system for some really well rounded sound (up to 10W power output). Perfectly sized to sit under an iMac display, XtremeMac is known for making Apple accessories. Fortunately, the Tango Bar is PC and Mac compatible for a change. Although, since Apple has been upping the power on their USB ports for awhile, you may get more oomph from them. XtremeMac claims there is a total of 6 speakers on the Tango Bar but 2 of those are passive radiators, which do help add a little bass but using active woofer back-pressure to do so. Besides the power, the slick look also makes the USB soundbar a conversation piece. A single component with a single USB connection adds clean style to your setup. The sound mounted volume control glows when powered on for easy control with the lights off. It’s also uniquely equipped with a subwoofer output line for connecting to some real bass power. This might take away from the portability but would enable some truly intense sound if done correctly. Olasonic’s 20W Super-charged USB Speakers (2012) Olasonic’s TW-S7 (reviewed in 2012) is a pair of bus-powered speakers that are purported to deliver 10W+10W stereo sound over a single USB cable. Achieving 10 watts per speaker seems impossible as the USB 2.0 can only deliver up to 2.5W total, or 12% of what Olasonic claims to be able to deliver. The secret to this high output lies in the fact that the TW-S7 stores unused USB power in on-board capacitors. Since maximum output is rarely ever achieved as there is a varying of sound intensity at any given sound level, there’s unused power that can be repurposed. Having said that, the downside is you will not always get that 20W of power as once the capacitors are drained you will be back 2.5W. This setup is not all that unique we’ve seen something very similar before. What’s interesting is the fact that Olasonic has opted for massive 60mm drivers. These certainly will help with not only the low end, but also allow for crystal clear sound at higher sound levels. You can still grab glossy white or black TW-S7s for around $80. BassJump 2 Adds Subwoofer to Any Mac (2012) TwelveSouth has an odd accessory for folks that live off of their MacBooks, the BassJump 2.  While the beloved MacBooks in general are great for most things and those sleek aluminium slabs are jammed with great hardware, there just isn’t room for powerful speakers. The sound is decent but if you really want rich sound with some oomph, you go elsewhere. TwelveSouth has engineered their USB audio solution not to replace the internal speakers but accompany them by focusing on the frequencies missing from standard speakers. TwelveSouth’s software needs be installed to conduct the 2 system symphony but otherwise it’s plug and play. The software adds some nice visuals to go along with the thump with VU meters and fine tuning. When trying to guess at the amount of power possible in the shoebox-sized speaker, remember that Apple has upped the voltage on its USB ports for some time now. So, you may get quite the shock with something tuned to that specific platform. The BassJump 2 is unfortunately only made for the Macbooks (and iMac).  This is for you if you are Mac-ready and a fan of Bassnectar, dub-step or other similarly bass-heavy music. JLab B-Flex X-Bass (2011) When it comes to selecting USB speakers to replace the ones built into your laptop, there’s typically a few varieties to choose from. Some are meant to be stood on a desk, some may latch onto the sides of the laptop screen, and still others will grasp the top of the screen in a one-piece soundbar configuration. No matter the design there’s usually an excess of USB cable slack to contend with along with excess connecting wire if the speakers are split. JLab shuns these traditional designs with their B-Flex X-Bass (reviewed in 2011) and instead takes a more asymmetrical, cable-free approach that’s sure to turn heads. In essence, the B-Flex X-Bass takes a pair of stereo speakers rests them atop of a flexible metal USB stalk that behaves like a reading lamp. The appearance is so off-kilter that it honestly becomes a slight distraction when plugged in. For its size, the B-Flex manages to pump out a surprising amount of sound. The crisp highs and kicking lows certainly live up to the hype, though you’ll want to tweak the EQ to make up for the neglected midtones. The unique design inherently works well for laptop users at the desk or on the couch. Overall, this one-piece USB speaker delivers amazingly loud and vibrant sound for its diminutive size, but suffers from a lack of mids and highly directional sound. Altec Lansing Orbit Mobile Speakers (2011) The Altec Lansing Orbit (reviewed in 2011) is designed with portability in mind while satisfying users who need stereo seperations for their audio output. Out of the box, it is much more than meets the eye, as a simple twist separates the two speakers and reveal the cabling needed for connectivity. When together, it is about the size of two stacked 355 ml. pop cans stacked together. Thankfully, Altec Lansing includes metal foldable stands on each of the speaker, and have small rubber grommets to ensure stability. Back to the speakers, these speakers are by no means shy on volume either. They can easily fill a room with great sound without distorting sound, although the quality may vary as you move from the audio sweetspot. The Orbit audio output also scales volume very well, and each percentage is noticeable to allow fine tuning of the volume to suit each environment. However, when the speakers are fully deployed, it results in a messy pile of cables and packing up these speakers without retractable cables is no easy task. Altec Lansing still has a great deal to offer in terms of sound quality over the competition. Bowers & Wilkins MM-1 High-fidelity USB Speakers (2009) Bowers & Wilkins has managed to compresses their enormous high fidelity Zeppelin speakers for iPhone into a size that is just right to accompany a laptop. The B&W MM-1 is fueled by USB exclusively.  These speakers have B&W’s signature sound processing system handling all of the audio creation from digital source. This removes the problem of low quality PC on-board sound systems tainting the music in the first place.  The MM-1’s built-in amplifier takes care of everything else with up to 36W per driver. The MM-1 also sports a line-in jack for connecting directly to MP3 players and a very handy headphone jack for private listening. There’s also a wireless remote which will probably only control the volume.  Due to the speakers actually being a USB audio device, the remote is capable of much more than just volume but no details have surfaced at this time.  You can still expect to empty your piggy bank to get these on their way to you but at least the shipping costs won’t be as much as for the Zeppelin. That’s all for now.  Hope you enjoy finding these USB speakers suited for your needs.  If you find anything else that belongs to this list, please let us know by leaving your suggestion or comment below. 2shares 0 2 0 0 0 Featured USB Speakers on Amazon F G T : R Home Reviews Features News About © 2017 Everything USB.

Home Apple News Apple Rumors iPhone iPad iPod Mac Apple TV Apple Watch About Apple News Apple TV Share on Facebook Apple plans to offer “premium” streaming TV services with HBO Although Apple’s bite apple efforts seem to have failed, Apple does not give up on its goal of delivering a premium streaming service package through its Apple TV device and additionally in iOS. As we have been informed from Recode, Apple is currently working to sell its consumers a “premium TV package” that would consist of three popular platforms: HBO, Showtime and Starz. There are already many providers offering a similar streaming service package, but they often require a subscription to a basic level of channels. Be that as it may, Apple’s choice would allow users to subscribe to only these three premium platforms. Apple wants to get into the realm of TV in streaming The goal of Apple is to offer a package as a service provided via iOS and Apple TV, a move that would put the company full in the world of TV streaming, although indirectly, of course. For now, Apple offers HBO for $ 15 a month, Showtime for $ 11 a month and Starz for $ 9 a month on the App Store. We do not know what price the company will choose for the package, but it should be around $ 20. Recall that the bite apple company has already tried something similar to offer an application in both TVOS and iOS with different platforms of services in streaming so that users can enjoy their favourite series in a much more Efficient and intuitive. In conclusion The truth is that the alternative that Apple is planning to offer is very good, but would be much better if it were more customizable, for example for users to choose Netflix and HBO, but this would entail many complications.

Home Apple News Apple Rumors iPhone iPad iPod Mac Apple TV Apple Watch About Apple News Apple TV Share on Facebook Amazon Prime Video could reach the Apple TV this summer Today, large streaming content companies are waging an intense battle with each other as they continue to strive for a balance between original and external production. The great protagonists of this war, Netflix and Amazon, continue trying to keep its users hooked to any of their creations to avoid that they stop paying the subscription, or worse, that they happen to the competition. But you have already realised, that, for this, they need something more. To prevent users from switching to other similar services, content providers should give them the facility to enjoy all of their content in any way they want. It does not matter if you are connected or not, or if you do not have access to your usual device, your content should always be with you. This is something that already happens, or at least partially in the case of Amazon, and is that there is still a place through which its users will not be able to access its content. That place is the Apple TV, or at least, it will be until this summer if the information is correct. Both Amazon and Apple are interested in Prime Video coming to the App Store as soon as possible As I said, if the information provided from Recode is correct, the Apple TV might have in the App Store the application of Amazon Prime Video since this summer. Apparently, Amazon and Apple would have had talks to fix this problem that benefited no one. On the one hand, Apple TV users could not access the Amazon Prime Video offer, on the other, Amazon customers could not acquire the device because it had no access to Prime Video. The issue would have reached such a level that, according to the same sources, those responsible for this agreement were Tim Cook and Jeff Bezos, top executives of Apple and Amazon, respectively. Fortunately, it seems that the wait is over, and soon we will be able to make use of our Apple TV to see some chapters of series like Mozart in the Jungle, or Transparent, that already they were missed by these homes.

Plus, our most popular articles and videos for the week ended May 5. PrintCommentRecommend (-) By Morningstar.com | 05-06-17 | 05:00 AM | Email Article Inspired by Harper's Index (with a tip of the hat to FiveThirtyEight's Significant Digits blog), Morningstar Runs the Numbers uses a numbers-based approach to highlight recent Morningstar research, along with some outside news stories. About the Author Morningstar.com offers coverage of 950 stocks, 1,150 mutual funds, and 300 ETFs, plus market news, economic analysis, portfolio-planning insights, and investment commentary. Contact Author | Meet other investing specialists 50.8 million Apple reported sales of 50.8 million iPhones in its second quarter. Overall, the company reported solid fiscal results and provided investors with a third-quarter forecast that was relatively in line with director of technology, media, and telecom equity research Brian Colello's expectations, and points to decent ongoing demand for Apple's products and services. /p> "Services revenue grew nicely, which we think still bodes well for customer stickiness around the iOS ecosystem, which is the backbone of our narrow moat rating for the firm. Further, Apple issued a healthy raise to its capital return program, boosting its quarterly dividend by 10.5% and adding $35 billion to its share repurchase authorization. We will maintain our $138 fair value estimate for Apple and shares appear fairly valued today." 211,000 The Labor Department said the United States added 211,000 jobs in April, ahead of expectations. The unemployment rate also inched down to 4.4%, the lowest rate in a decade. Despite the cheery headline number, director of economic analysis Bob Johnson views the report as mixed, though he says we in "very stable territory." 10 Value stocks have underperformed their growth counterparts over the past 10 years, though not by nearly the same margin as they did during the tech bubble: Over the trailing 10 years ended April 30, the Morningstar US Growth Index has outpaced its Value counterpart by over 3 percentage points. This invites the question, are there bargains to be found? "We examined the nearly 500 constituents of the Morningstar US Value Index. First we removed companies that our analysts do not cover. Then we focused only on firms that have economic moats of wide or narrow, which means our analysts think the company has a durable competitive advantage that will allow it maintain its profitability over the long term. (This step helps avoid value traps.) Finally, we sorted the stocks that passed our screen by lowest and highest price/fair value to find the 10 cheapest value stocks, and the 10 most expensive." 4 The threats to bottom-up active equity management are real, and it is the rare stock-fund jockey who has not at least attempted to harness technology to refine and streamline his investment process, says Dan Culloton, director of equity strategies for Morningstar's manager research group. But there remain managers whose main competitive advantage is still good, old-fashioned research and stock-picking. Culloton gives four examples of medalist-rated funds that have been successful with plying a decidedly low-tech active management approach. $250 billion Speaking of Apple, Dow Jones reported ahead of the company's earnings release that its stockpile of cash has likely topped a quarter of a trillion dollars. What's more, the company has doubled its cash pile in just over 4 1/2 years; in the last three months of 2016, it racked up new cash at a rate of about $3.6 million an hour, Dow Jones said. "[This is] an unrivaled corporate hoard that is greater than the market value of both Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Procter & Gamble Co. and exceeds the combined foreign-currency reserves held by the U.K. and Canada combined." 4X The Securities and Exchange Commission this week approved a request to list ForceShares Daily 4X US Market Futures Long Fund (proposed ticker UP), and ForceShares Daily 4X US Market Futures Short Fund (proposed ticker DOWN). As you probably inferred from its name, the long fund is designed to deliver 400% of the daily performance of S&P 500 stock index futures, while the short fund will aim to deliver four times the inverse daily return. Many market participants expressed concern that these risky instruments could cause investors to lose money very rapidly; one trader interviewed by CNBC called them "market crack." "This is an innovation for people who are going to run the game, sit behind the table and deal the cards, and it's going to be a really bad innovation for those who think they can buy it and juice up some of their returns," said Sal Arnuk, a principal at Themis Trading. "This is market crack, and it concerns me." -0.42, -0.01 Finally, director of manager research Russ Kinnel tweeted this interesting observation:  Most Popular Articles, Videos, and Securities Most Popular Articles  10 Solid Value Stocks at Great Prices (and 10 to Pass Up) Funds That Buy Like Buffett, 2017 How Much Cash Do You Really Need? 10 Funds That Beat the Market Over 15 Years Jack Bogle: It's Easier to Serve One Master Than Two Most Popular Videos   A Buffett-Like Small-Company Fund on Our Radar Why Active Bond Managers Are Succeeding Service Complaints Aside, Investors See Value at Vanguard Tail Risks That Keep a Bond Manager Up at Night As Retirement Nears, Customize Your Plan Most Requested Stock Quotes Apple Amazon Berkshire Hathaway Facebook AT&T  Most Requested Stock Analyses Cameco Apple Vornado Realty Trust Amazon.com Hanesbrands Most Requested Fund Quotes Vanguard 500 Index Fidelity Contrafund Vanguard Dividend Growth Dodge & Cox Stock Vanguard Total Stock Market Index    Most Requested Fund Analyses Vanguard High-Yield Tax-Exempt Fidelity New Markets Income T.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Smartphones OnePlus 5 release date, price, concept design tipped in fresh leaks If this concept video is anything close to the real OnePlus 5, big boys like Samsung, Apple must run for shelter. Sami Khan   May 6, 2017 14:57 IST OnePlus 5Screenshot/YouTube/DBS Designing Every smartphone enthusiast has a vague image of what OnePlus 5 might look like, but this video puts those thoughts into a clear presentation. If everything shown in the latest OnePlus 5 concept video is anything close to the real deal, the Chinese smartphone maker is looking at a grand successful launch party. OnePlus 5 is still a month away from being officially launched, but it hasn't stopped tipsters from sharing essential details about the phone, which may well be true. From price to key specifications, we've heard a lot about the OnePlus 5 smartphone already. In a first, we get to see the OnePlus 5's design in a visual presentation rather than on paper. The latest concept video was shared by TechDroider and it showcases the possible design of the OnePlus 5 smartphone. The video entails tiny details about the smartphone based on the rumours we have heard in the past. But that's just a concept and little do we know whether OnePlus will take cues from it. For what it's worth, the design showcased in the video looks chic and it could put many flagship smartphones to shame. The video shows the OnePlus 5 with minimal bezels, dual rear-camera, a physical home button in a shiny black avatar. For most part, it looks like the perfected version of OnePlus X, a smartphone that did not amplify the company's image as it was supposed to. For all we know, OnePlus has already finalised on the design on the OnePlus 5. There have even been rumours about the handset's price, which according to a listing on OppoMart, is $449 (around Rs. 28,800). At this price, the OnePlus 5 is poised to pose a serious threat to flagship models and offer a cheaper alternative to handsets like Samsung Galaxy S8, LG G6, iPhone 8 and others. For that price, OnePlus doesn't seem to be compromising on the specs at all. It is said to come with a 5.5-inch QHD 2K display, 12MP dual camera with RGB and Monochrome lenses and an 8MP front snapper for selfies. Under the hood, it will pack a Snapdragon 835 chipset, 6GB/8GB RAM, 128GB/256GB storage, and a 3,600mAh battery with Dash Charge 2.0. With the official launch expected in June, readers should to take this bit of information with due scepticism until the company confirms it. Related What should you expect from OnePlus 5's camera?

Chandrababu Naidu meets Apple COO Jeff Williams in California, U.S.   V. Raghavendra VIJAYAWADA May 06, 2017 13:45 IST Updated: May 06, 2017 14:29 IST more-in The much-anticipated Apple's foray into Andhra Pradesh got a fillip following Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu’s meeting with the company’s Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams on Day-2 of his U.S. tour. Mr. Naidu told Mr. Williams that this was the right time for Apple Inc. to invest in India as it has been growing consistently. Being a State that has just begun building itself from the scratch post-bifurcation, A.P. offered tremendous opportunities. Apple would do well to enter A.P. which has been adjudged the best State to do business with and has a productive young population, the Chief Minister asserted. Gopi Sirineni, Vice-president of Qualcomm Technologies, expressed keenness to participate in the A.P. Fibernet project. Google X, a premier R&D laboratory of Google Inc. situated in California, came forward to offer Internet services up to the village-level in A.P. Mr. Naidu was an assurance to that effect by Google X CEO Astro Teller, who unveiled the plethora of innovations taking place in his lab in a presentation to Mr. Naidu during the latter’s visit to the Google X facility at Mountain View. Mr. Naidu was shown the autonomous car manufactured by Waymo — a subsidiary of Google’s parent company Alphabet Inc., Google glasses and high-altitude balloons that provide Internet access to rural areas. Later, Mr. Teller and Mr. Naidu had discussions on possible areas of collaboration between Andhra Pradesh government and Google X. During a separate interaction with potential investors, Russ Drinker, Director (global architecture, sustainability and environmental wellness) of M Moser Associates — a leading U.S.-based architecture and designing firm, evinced interest in partnering with Andhra Pradesh government in the construction of Amaravati. Padmasri Warrior, founder of NIO electric vehicle company and former Chief Technology Officer of CISCO and Motorola and Sridhar Vembu, founder of California-based software major Zoho Corporation, were among those who called on Mr. Naidu later in the evening. The Andhra Pradesh government signed MoUs with Innova Solutions, I-Bridge Inc and Evx Solutions, which are expected to provide jobs for over 12,000 people in the State.

The iPad is locked, however, the home screen displays a child in a stroller. The owner can come to City Hall and claim the electronic device. Police say woman gave false name A Hazleton woman allegedly gave police her sister’s name to avoid getting in trouble after a brick was thrown in West Hazleton. Monica Torres, 20, faces one count of false identification to law enforcement by West Hazleton police as a result of the May 8, 2016 incident. The charge was filed against her June 23, 2016, and she was arraigned Friday by Magisterial District Judge James Dixon, Hazle Twp., who set bail at $5,000. Unable to post the money, Torres was taken to jail. Court papers state Torres gave police a false identity when they stopped the vehicle she was driving after a brick was thrown at a vehicle by a woman in the 400 block of West Green Street. The female who caused the damage, police wrote, was reportedly picked up by a tan vehicle traveling east on West Green which Torres was driving. Police learned Torres’ true identity and she admitted to giving her sister’s information, court papers state. Threats lead to charges, police say A criminal charge was filed against a Hazleton man police say threatened the mother of his child.

The victim, arrest papers state, told police she received threatening text messages from Jon while she was home on East Elm Street on Jan. 22. Jon, the father of her child, threatened her safety and that of her other child, a newborn, for about two hours, court papers state. The messages which contained racial and vulgar language, police said, continued despite the victim asking him to stop. When confronted by police at his home on West Birch Street, Jon said he sent the messages out of anger because he felt as if he wasn’t getting enough time with his daughter and didn’t intend to hurt anyone, court papers state. Pedestrian charged with drunkenness A Mountain Top man found walking on a road with an unsteady gait by Fairview Twp. police early in the morning April 1 faces charges, court papers say. Matthew J. Papsun, 24, faces possession of marijuana, use or possession of drug paraphernalia and public drunkenness. The charges were filed against him April 21 and issued via summons, which he accepted April 26. Papsun, police said, was found in the area of 33 Wilkes Lane on April 1 at 2:24 a.m. staggering and having trouble keeping balance. He had a strong odor of alcohol on his breath, arrest papers state, bloodshot and glossy eyes and slurred speech. Police said they also found a glass pipe, commonly used to smoke marijuana, along with a small amount of marijuana in his possession. Rice Twp. police assisted. Court date in store for alleged thief A Nesquehoning man stole from a borough store, arrest papers say. Travis J. Litts, 31, faces retail theft by borough police, for the Jan. 12 theft of a soda and two candy bars at Turkey Hill, 200 W. Catawissa St., around 10 p.m. The charge was filed against him April 20 and issued via summons, which he accepted April 26. Litts was taken into custody outside the store, arrest papers state, and admitted to asking a woman for money and when she refused, he decided to take the merchandise from the store. He did get an offer from a friend to use her food card to buy a sandwich but it didn’t work, court papers state. Litts told police he took the items because he was hungry and had no money for food, police wrote. Drug Task Force helps nab woman A Tamaqua woman was arrested recently for allegedly selling narcotics in the borough in September. Amanda L. Cope, 27, faces two counts manufacture, delivery or possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance and one count possession of a controlled substance. The charges were filed against her March 23 and she was arraigned April 18 by Magisterial District Judge Stephen Bayer, Tamaqua, who set bail at 10 percent of $25,000. Police said they were watching as Cope sold methadone pills in September, arrest papers state. The Schuylkill County Drug Task Force was involved in the investigation. Theft caught on camera, cops say Security cameras showed money being stolen from a Summit Hill home by a borough man, court papers say. Charles W. Nace, 19, faces two counts each of burglary, theft and criminal trespass as a result. He was jailed after failing to post 10 percent of $50,000 bail set by Magisterial District Judge William Kissner, Palmerton, April 28. The charges were filed against him April 26. Arrest papers state the victim learned money and a backpack containing a handgun were missing from his home at 140 E. Hazard St. on Feb. 4. Several items in the house were shuffled around, police wrote, and an officer suggested he install a motion-activated security camera linked to his cellphone to catch the thief. Then on Feb. 21 he contacted police again, arrest papers state, and this time he was missing at least $200 but cameras captured the theft and the suspect, Nace. Nace denied taking the backpack and gun Feb. 4 but admitted to entering the home on two separate occasions where he took money, police wrote. Crash driver charged with DUI A West Hazleton man was allegedly intoxicated when he crashed his vehicle into another March 5. Adelso D. Hernandez, 59, faces two counts driving under the influence and five summary violations including accidents involving damage to unattended vehicle or property. The charges were filed against him April 18 and issued via summons, which he accepted April 26. Sugarloaf Twp. police contacted West Hazleton police at 12:24 a.m. that day to say they spotted a heavily damaged vehicle parked in the 200 block of North Broad Street. West Hazleton police realized the crash must have just happened as they were just in the area and noticed no damages. When they returned, they found a fresh fluid trail coming from a damaged Hyundai and followed it to a silver Nissan Quest parked at an apartment building at 501 Winters Ave., where they learned Hernandez lived. Officers say Hernandez appeared intoxicated and injured and was taken to Lehigh Valley Hospital-Hazleton by West Hazleton ambulance. A blood sample later showed a blood alcohol content of 0.231 percent, arrest papers state.

The Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting will be held on 6 May. The Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting will be held on 6 May, reports Morningstar Analysts. Jeremy Glaser, the market editor for Morningstar, asks Gregg Warren what he expects will be discussed on Saturday. Greg is a senior stock analyst who covers Berkshire for Morningstar. He'll also be on a panel of analysts asking questions of Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger at the meeting. What do you expect to be dominating the conversation? This year, we're going to see 3G pop its head up again. It's been a topic in past years and sort of revolves around Berkshire's relationship with 3G Capital. Back in 2013, it really kind of popped up when they bankrolled the purchase of Heinz with 3G Capital. In 2015 it rose again when they were bankrolling the Tim Hortons combination with Burger King as well as the acquisition, or I should say the merger of Kraft with Heinz. The failed attempt on Kraft Heinz's as a part to buy Unilever earlier this year is going to be a big topic of conversation. It's going to not only raise questions about that relationship and what Berkshire gets from it and what Berkshire shareholders should expect from it longer term, but I think it also sort of begs questions about Kraft Heinz. Have they sort of reached a pinnacle on how much margin improvement they can bring out of the business and do they need additional acquisitions to keep that story going? Apart from Well Fargo what are people going to talk about? Yeah. Wells Fargo is sort of Buffett's favourite holding, and he has been petitioning the Fed for almost a year now to allow Berkshire to maintain more than a 10% stake. It gets more difficult once they get past that 10% threshold. They sort of have to act in a very passive manner. We get the sense that there may have been additional restrictions that are going to be put on Berkshire if they maintain that stake above that level. Earlier this month Berkshire walked away from that pursuit of that sort of dispensation from the Fed. They've agreed to sell down the stake below 10%. The question longer term is, does this mean that Wells Fargo is going to be a perpetually declining stake within Berkshire's portfolio? Because as Wells Fargo buys back stock every year, they are going to have to adjust down their portfolio or look to see whether or not they have to adjust down their holdings to get below that threshold. Serious questions about the size of Berkshire's portfolio. Yeah. I think, Apple--and even if you go back a few years to sort of IBM--I think they've raised some serious questions about the size of Berkshire's portfolio and whether or not they're somewhat handicapped now where they can only buy the largest of the large caps. Because if you think about it, for a company like Apple, they bought a $7 billion stake. That seems enormous. But Apple's market cap is $700 billion-plus. So, it really only amounted to about 1% of the company's outstanding shares. So, it's not as likely to, say, move the shares overall than if they were to try to take a $7 billion in a much smaller firm. So, I think that this raises some questions about the challenges that the investment portfolio has and more so what Todd and Ted are going to have longer term as they look to sort of populate the portfolio with meaningful enough positions to be impactful but at the same time also tapping into companies that may be able to grow at a faster rate than say your mega-caps. Buffett getting into airlines The airlines kind of caught us off guard a little bit. Buffett's never been a big fan and suddenly they were piling into four different airlines within the past six months. And it just seems counterintuitive. I know that there's talk about the consolidation of the industry. They are a little bit more rational now. But it begs sort of the question is, are there comparisons here--and I know a lot of investors are worried sort of voice these--but when they bought BNSF nearly a decade ago, they went out and bought a handful of railroads beforehand before they finally bought up all of the BNSF. So, there is some hope here that they buy one of the airlines on some investors' parts. My big concern with the airlines is that they are really sort of pegged to commodity prices, to oil prices, fuel prices overall. With your standard railroad, not only do they have sort of the track right away sort of empowering a wide economic moat, there's few of the railroad domestically and even within North America when you count the Canadian railroads. But from a pricing perspective, they have contracts in place that will move up and down the charges relative to where fuel prices go. Airlines, fuel prices go up, you can only raise ticket prices if everybody else raises ticket prices and vice versa. When oil prices fall significantly, if you wait too long, your competitors are going to undercut you by dropping prices on tickets overall. It's very, very sort of competitive in that realm. So, we're kind of curious to see if questions get asked along those lines.(Disclaimer: The article appeared on Morningstar India.

Once a user was ‘Greyballed,’ so to speak, Uber would show a different version of the its app with fake cars that would not respond to call requests.” The software was first revealed by The New York Times in March, prompting the investigation. In April, The New York Times also reported that Uber was nearly kicked off of the Apple App Store after they were caught breaking privacy rules. “For months, [Uber CEO Travis] Kalanick had pulled a fast one on Apple by directing his employees to help camouflage the ride-hailing app from Apple’s engineers,” reported The Times. “The reason? So Apple would not find out that Uber had been secretly identifying and tagging iPhones even after its app had been deleted and the devices erased — a fraud detection maneuver that violated Apple’s privacy guidelines.” The article painted Kalanick as a serial rule-breaker, who would frequently push the lines in an effort to advance his company. “In a quest to build Uber into the world’s dominant ride-hailing entity, Mr. Kalanick has openly disregarded many rules and norms, backing down only when caught or cornered,” The New York Times claimed. “He has flouted transportation and safety regulations, bucked against entrenched competitors and capitalized on legal loopholes and gray areas to gain a business advantage. In the process, Mr. Kalanick has helped create a new transportation industry, with Uber spreading to more than 70 countries and gaining a valuation of nearly $70 billion, and its business continues to grow.” Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 6 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Asia Pacific Dominates Global Consumer Electronics Market Fueled by Increasing Demand for Smartphones The global consumer electronics market features several players dominating the market for a particular type of electronic device. However, players such as Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., Apple Inc., LG Corporation, Panasonic Corporation, Sony Corporation, HP, Nikon Corporation, Canon Inc., Koninklijke Philips N.V., and Dell Inc. have emerged as the dominant consumer electronics manufacturers due to their strong performance in multiple areas of the consumer electronics market. Browse Market Research Report @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/consumer-electronics-m… Rising Demand for Low-cost Consumer Electronics Drives Growth The increasing disposable income of consumers in developing economies is a major driver for the global consumer electronics market. While developed regions such as the U.S. and Western Europe are becoming saturated markets for consumer electronics, the demand for all types of consumer electronics is growing rapidly in Asia Pacific, Latin America, the Middle East, and large parts of Africa. The solid economic growth of countries such as India, China, South Korea, Russia, Brazil, South Africa, Argentina, and Thailand has propelled the global consumer electronics market and is likely to remain a determinant factor in the market’s growth in the coming years. The reducing prices of electronic items, particularly smartphones, are another major factor driving the global consumer electronics market. As companies from developing companies have been able to exploit the availability of cheap labor to their advantage, established Western giants have faced increasing competition in developing regions in the last few years. The rapid rise of Chinese smartphone giants, Xiaomi and Huawei, is the perfect example of this phenomenon. The consistent technological innovation in consumer electronics has also played out well for the global market for the same. The abundance of manufacturers of consumer electronics has resulted in several companies focusing on previously unexplored niches and developing products to suit the changing lifestyles of their key consumers. “The major restraints on the global consumer electronics market are the erosion of the price margin of manufacturers due to the intense competition and the risk of continual technological advancements devaluing OEMs and making them unsustainable,” according to TMR’s lead analyst. Increasing Demand for Smartphones to Ensure Dominance of Handheld Devices By product type, the global consumer electronics market is segmented into handheld devices, television sets, personal computers, audio/video devices, cameras and camcorders, gaming consoles, and personal care products. Of these, handheld devices, which include smartphones and tablets, are expected to remain the largest segment of the consumer electronics market in the 2014-2020 forecast period. Fill the form for an exclusive sample of this report @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag… The increasing demand for low-cost handheld devices in developing regions is a prominent feature of the global consumer electronics market and is likely to remain unchanged over the aforementioned forecast period. Asia Pacific was the largest market for consumer electronics in 2013. Furthermore, the increasing demand for and production of consumer electronics in Southeast Asian countries are likely to ensure rapid growth of the Asia Pacific consumer electronics market in the 2014-2020 forecast period.

Apple recalls thousands of iPhone 6s in UAE Claire Bautista February 10, 2017 3:07 pm TECHNOLOGY 1.9K 0 DUBAI – Tech giant Apple is set to recall 88,000 iPhone 6s handsets in UAE due to battery issues, a media report stated. According to a khaleejtimes.com report, citing Arabic daily Emarat Al Youm, the UAE’s Ministry of Economy stated that only specific iPhone 6s which contain defective batteries made in China during September and October 2015 will be recalled. Apple has recently expressed that a very small number of iPhone 6s devices may unexpectedly shut down. If you have experienced this issue, the firm has urged residents to use the serial number checker (www.apple.com/ae/support/iPhone6s-unexpectedshutdown/) if your iPhone 6s is eligible for a battery replacement, free of charge.
