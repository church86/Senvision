As the world waits patiently to find out whether Apple’s next iPhone will feature an OLED screen, the company is researching an even more groundbreaking display technology for future products. According to Digitimes, the Cupertino, California company is currently experimenting with micro LED displays in the hopes of beginning “trial production” on a limited scale at the end of the year. While Digitimes’ report does not mention what devices would receive the technology first, some speculated years ago that the company would look to micro LED to power the Apple Watch’s display. Instead, the company turned to OLED, which allows for greater color contrast and is more efficient than conventional LED screens, as it allows pixels to be powered independently without a backlight. Micro LED looks to be even more efficient than both of those technologies, however, and has yet to launch in any consumer device. Apple acquired a developer of such panels, Luxvue, in 2014. At the time, Luxvue was promoting micro LED as a technology that could deliver nine times the brightness of conventional LEDs — which are already considerably brighter than OLED displays — while simultaneously drawing less power from a device’s battery. The energy benefits make it clear why Apple might opt to use micro LED in its watches down the road, as the extremely small batteries in wearables make longevity on a charge a top priority. However, do not expect to see these kinds of displays hitting the market very soon. For one, this is an unverified rumor about an emerging technology, so it would be wise not to take it at face value. Further, another report from the Taipei Times in March quotes industry analyst Annabelle Hsu as saying micro LED likely will not become commercially viable until 2020. Also, Apple has never demonstrated a propensity to jump on hot and unproven technologies before its competitors — as evidenced by its slow adoption of OLED displays, while many other phone makers have been using them for more than five years. There is a first time for everything, of course, and the fact still remains Apple purchased a company that specializes in the technology — so there is a clear ambition to one day deliver micro LED to the masses. But that day appears still a ways off.

OPINION Letters Comment ePAPER CLASSIFIEDS Apple and Nokia see deeper partnership after ending patent dispute International Business Tue, 23 May 2017 Reuters Helsinki: Apple has settled a patent dispute with Finnish telecom equipment maker Nokia and agreed to buy more of its network products and services, sending Nokia shares up seven per cent. The deal means Nokia will get bigger royalties from Apple for using its mobile phone patents, helping offset the impact of waning demand for its mobile network hardware. Such legal battles are common in the industry but can drag on for years and analysts had not been expecting such a quick resolution to the dispute that started in December. Under the deal announced in a joint statement from the companies on Tuesday, Nokia will also supply network infrastructure products to Apple, and Apple will resume sales of Nokia's digital health products in retail and online stores and look at further collaboration in health. Digital health is one of the areas Nokia is targeting as it tries to develop new businesses to offset the industry-wide slump in demand for network equipment. Last year, Nokia bought France's Withings S.A., a small firm with products such as activity trackers and baby monitors built on digital platforms. "There could emerge big future value from this as Apple could become an important distribution channel," said Handelsbanken analyst Daniel Djurberg, who has an "accumulate" recommendation for Nokia shares. "I have not given any value so far for Nokia's digital health business, but might apply an option value to it." Nokia chief executive Rajeev Suri told the company's annual general meeting later on Tuesday that the deal would help expand network sales beyond telecom operators to global internet and technology giants. "(The deal) involves a business collaboration ... in particular in areas of IP and optical equipment, which is quite key to webscale players when they build their data centres," he said. "It's a good deal, a multi-year licensing deal, and I love it that it has an industrial deal and aspect to it." Under the patent licence agreement, Nokia will receive a "significant" upfront cash payment and additional revenues from Apple starting from the current quarter. The companies did not give further details but analysts said the revenue was likely to be far higher than a previous deal. Inge Heydorn, fund manager at Sentat Asset Management, said it was a smart move to collaborate on digital health products. "It's interesting for Nokia in a five- to 10-year perspective since I think it will be hard to be profitable within mobile infrastructure," said Heydorn, whose firm does not hold any shares in Nokia. Nokia shares, which fell in December when the patent dispute was announced, jumped to their highest since February 2016 and were up 6.7 per cent at 5.89 euros by 1509 GMT. A previous patent licence contract between the companies expired last year, and both sides took legal action in December. Apple complained of being overcharged and Nokia responded by accusing Apple of violating technology patents. In the absence of a new deal, Nokia cut its annual run-rate forecast in December for patent and brand licensing sales to 800 million euros ($900 million) from 950 million euros previously. In its latest quarterly report released in April, Nokia stopped giving an annual run-rate forecast altogether. "(The agreement) moves our relationship with Apple from being adversaries in court to business partners," Nokia's chief legal officer Maria Varsellona said in a statement. Analysts were surprised by the relatively quick resolution of the dispute between Apple and Nokia. "Nokia told analysts in April don't calculate on any licence revenue from Apple, not even in 2018, so this is a positive surprise. It will also limit Nokia's legal expenses," said Djurberg who said he would probably raise his Nokia estimates. "For Nokia, it's good news they got this out of the way, but we still have to wait for details about the financial impact," said OP Equities analyst Hannu Rauhala. "The previous annual rate was 150 million euros, so I assume this to be more, around 500 million euros." Rauhala said Apple might have been willing to settle with Nokia as the US company's patent battle with chipmaker Qualcomm Inc has escalated. Patent royalties represent only a sliver of Nokia's overall revenue, more than 90 per cent of which comes from telecoms network equipment. But licensing payments are highly profitable and the network business is suffering an industry-wide slump. Nokia's patents cover technology that reduces the need for hardware components in a phone, conserves battery life, increases radio reception, helps in recovering lost phones and enables voice recognition, among other features. Once the world's dominant cellphone maker, Nokia sold its handset business to Microsoft in 2014 to focus on its network business and large portfolio of mobile device patents. Nokia's total sales in 2016 were about 24 billion euros.

The company has opted not to sell the product directly, instead distributing the device via carrier partners. The 32 GB iPhone 6 originally debuted in emerging markets, presumably as a lower cost option, but has more recently appeared in the US — and now it has hit the UK too … Try Amazon Prime 30-Day Free Trial In the United Kingdom, the 32 GB iPhone 6 launched today on the EE network. The model is the same as the SKU offered in the United States, available only in Space Grey. The most remarkable thing about this phone isn’t the phone itself but the fact that Apple decided to bring it back. Its technical specifications are identical to the device from 2014 except for the storage bump; the original run of iPhone 6 was only ever offered in 16/64/128 GB options. In case you’ve forgotten, the iPhone 6 was the first iPhone with a 4.7-inch display and features an Apple A8 chip and an 8-megapixel camera. It seems like Apple is selling this phone again as a way to boost iPhone sales in a quiet period as many high-en customers await the next-generation devices coming this fall. However, the 32 GB iPhone 6 is not a great purchase for UK buyers. The EE carrier plans are not really competitively priced for a phone handset that is really several generations old. You have to commit to a 24-month contract to get it and it’s not that much cheaper than a brand new iPhone 7 with the same data plan. Separately, we have been hearing that EE will soon be expanding its free Apple Music subscription promotion to existing customers. Soon, many EE iPhone customers will be able to take advantage of an offer that gifts them a free 6 months of Apple Music (exact terms and conditions are currently unclear). The 32 GB iPhone 6 has been launched in the US, India and many European markets in recent weeks. Check out 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news!

The course is available for free on iBooks (plus teacher’s guide) for anyone to download, and builds on the Everyone Can Code series Apple already publishes. This fall, Apple says six American community colleges will teach the curriculum as well as ‘select high schools’. Apple wants to help more people learn to code and enter the app economy. Try Amazon Prime 30-Day Free Trial Apple says ‘App Development with Swift’ teaches students a solid foundation in programming using Swift. It features Xcode tutorials and structured lessons about data types, variables and even elements of application design. It includes enough material to be taught across an entire year. In the first unit, students learn how to create a ‘flashlight’ app where tapping the screen toggles the background color from white to black. The course includes Swift Playgrounds exercises, homework projects and quizzes as well as a teacher guide with solutions, teaching presentations and grading advice. From this fall, the following colleges will teach the curriculum: Alabama Community College, Columbus State Community College, Harrisburg Area Community College, Houston Community College, Mesa Community College and San Mateo Community College. Apple says that some high schools will also run the course and some local businesses will offer complementary internships and mentoring. Moreover, Houston Community College is opening a brand new iOS Coding and Design School centred on App Store development. In a statement, Apple CEO Tim Cook said that he hopes the new free courses ‘open doors for people of all ages and backgrounds’. “We’ve seen firsthand the impact that coding has on individuals and the US economy as a whole. The app economy and software development are among the fastest-growing job sectors in America and we’re thrilled to be providing educators and students with the tools to learn coding,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “Community colleges play a critical role in helping students achieve their dreams, and we hope these courses will open doors for people of all ages and backgrounds to pursue what they love.” You can find all of Apple’s free coding materials in a section of the iTunes Store, with resources for both students and teachers. To date, Apple announced over 1 million downloads of Swift Playgrounds and 430,000 downloads of the K-12 Everyone Can Code curriculum. Over 1,000 schools will use Apple’s Everyone Can Code teaching materials in lessons this fall. Check out 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news!

The study, which consisted go 60 participants, takes a look at how accurate fitness trackers are at measuring heart and calories burned… Spigen TEKA RA200 Airpods Earhooks Cover In addition to the Apple Watch, the study analyzed other wearables such as the Samsung Gear S2, the MIO Alpha 2, the Microsoft Band, the Fitbit Surge, and more. The 60 participants each wore these fitness trackers during exercise such as running, biking, and walking. From there, the fitness trackers were compared to what’s known as the “gold standard” of tracking, including the electrocardiograph for heart rate measurement and indirect calorimeter for tracking calories burned. In terms of heart rate tracking accuracy, the Apple Watch came out on top with a median error rate of 2 percent. The Samsung Gear S2 was found to be the least accurate, with a median error rate of 6.8 percent. In general, the study found that the highest error rates were generally observed during walking, whereas the lowest error rates were observed during cycling. For the walking task, three of the devices achieved a median error rate below 5%: the Apple Watch, 2.5% (1.1%–3.9%); the PulseOn, 4.9% (1.4%–8.6%); and the Microsoft Band, 5.6% (4.9%–6.3%). The remaining four devices had median error between 6.5% and 8.8%. Across devices and modes of activities, the Apple Watch achieved the lowest error in HR, 2.0% (1.2%–2.8%), while the Samsung Gear S2 had the highest HR error, 6.8% (4.6%–9.0%). While the Apple Watch shined in heart tracking, the same can’t be said for energy expenditure tracking. Though, in Apple’s defense, no wearable was able to come close to matching the performance of clinical grade indirect calorimeter. The study found that while the Apple Watch offered the most consistent energy expenditure tracking, it wasn’t necessarily the most accurate. In fact, the study claims that the Fitbit Surge was the most accurate with energy expenditure tracking, with an error rate of around 27 percent. The Microsoft Band came in at around 33 percent, while Apple Watch reported an error rate near 40 percent, though it was consistent. In last place was the PulseOn, which a 92.6 percent error rate. This isn’t the first study to find Apple Watch to be the most accurate heart rate tracker, as a study last October reported similar data. What’s interesting, however, is the energy expenditure tracking, which clearly represents an area where improvement is needed.

By Tiernan Ray May 25, 2017 12:58 a.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Wireless chip giant Qualcomm (QCOM), which has embroiled in lawsuits with its largest customer, Apple (AAPL), and Apple's contract manufacturers, for what Qualcomm says are unpaid royalties, tonight offered an update to its claims, requesting a preliminary injunction against the manufacturers, and expanding its description of Apple's "tortious interference." The request for an injunction likely will come as little surprise to Street analysts. Qualcomm's chief counsel, Don Rosenberg, said in prepared remarks regarding the request for injunction, "we are confident that our contracts will be found valid and enforceable but in the interim it is only fair and equitable that our licensees pay for the property they are using." In one document, Qualcomm updates the suit it brought against Apple's contract electronic manufacturers, including Compal, Wistron, and Hon Hai Precision, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, back on April 28th. In this updated version, Qualcomm argues it will eventually be proven correct on the merits, and requests a preliminary injunction to prevent what it says would be "irreparable harm" if the manufacturers are able to continue to withhold payments under Apple's orders in the meantime. "Qualcomm respectfully requests that the Court enjoin Defendants from violating the terms and conditions of their license agreements during the pendency of this litigation." In the second document, Qualcomm updated its responses as a defendant in the suit brought by Apple against it in the same jurisdiction. Qualcomm extends some of the counter-claims it had made about Apple's alleged unfair behavior. For example, Qualcomm starting on page 46 broadens out its discussion of how Apple interfered with the contract manufacturers, to starve Qualcomm of revenue, it says, because Apple knows it cannot win: Apple has interfered with Qualcomm's long-standing contracts with the Contract Manufacturers, instructing them to withhold more than [redacted] in royalties (to date) owed under the terms of their license agreements. But Apple has not stopped there. Instead, Apple has made clear that it will continue to embargo all Qualcomm royalties, for all Apple products, for the indefinite future. By withholding billions of dollars in royalties so long as Qualcomm defends itself against Apple's claims, Apple is hoping to make litigation unbearable for Qualcomm and, thereby, to extract through a forced settlement what it knows it cannot obtain through judicial process—a below-market direct license. Apple's tactics are egregious. Apple is tortiously interfering with the Contract Manufacturers' license agreements; its conduct also provides a separate and independent basis for concluding that Apple is an unwilling licensee; Qualcomm shares on Wednesday closed down 58 cents, or 1%, at $58.64.

No, Apple is not practicing to be carrier. This is how you horn in on 5G 25 May 2017 at 05:01, Richard Chirgwin Apple has filed a request with the United States Federal Communications Commission FCC to run wireless tests in spectrum bands associated with 5G. Since Cupertino will want to hold onto its place in the smartphone market once networks appear, it's hardly jaw-dropping that the 28 GHz and 39 GHz bands interest the company. Apple's FCC filing (PDF) requests permission “to assess cellular link performance in direct path and multipath environments between base station transmitters and receivers using this spectrum”. These tests, however, don't involve anything that looks much like an iPhone: the year-long experiments will use “a horn antenna with a half-power beamwidth of 20 degrees in the E-plane and H-plane and a downtilt between 20 - 25 degrees.” It looks to The Register like Cupertino wants to see how much the 28 GHz and 39 GHz bands can carry over backhaul distances – specifically the roughly 16 Km (10 miles) between Cupertino and Milpitas. Apple promises its experiments won't interfere with any existing earth-to-space licenses in the 28 GHz band, and it will coordinate with other microwave transmission users in the region. Fanbois reaching this point of the story may find themselves asking two questions. Firstly, seeing as Cupertino's already done an "iPhone 5", what on earth would it call a 5G iPhone? Secondly, if apple is testing backhaul might that mean it wants to become a wireless network operator? The Reg has no idea how to answer the first question. The second is easier to answer: as noted by LightReading, Apple's experiments are in line with other work particularly in the 39 GHz band, where all the currently-public experiments are in fixed applications.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Site Archive Sun Devil graduates ready to challenge the future Wednesday May 24, 2017 at 12:01 AM May 24, 2017 at 9:56 PM Rene Ray De La Cruz Staff Writer @DP_ReneDeLaCruz APPLE VALLEY — In a town that recently celebrated the opening of the Yucca Loma Bridge, a group of graduating seniors began building their own bridges to the future. The crowd erupted with joy and pride as over 500 seniors received their diplomas during Apple Valley High School’s 49th Annual Commencement on Wednesday. It was another wind-filled graduation ceremony as smiling seniors, wearing orange and white gowns, looked to the stands for family and friends during the event at Newton T. Bass Stadium in Apple Valley. Principal Dustin Conrad welcomed the class of 2017 and acknowledged the 42 parents of graduates who also received diplomas from AVHS from 1976 through 2000. As the standing room only crowd snapped photos and waved banners, Conrad said this year’s class “upheld the strong tradition” of AVHS by excelling in academic, athletic and other achievements. This year’s class took home $2.1 million in scholarships and produced nearly 20 graduates who will serve in the armed forces, including Savannah Rose Burt will be the first infantry Marine coming out of San Bernardino County and Sang Chul Bae who will attend the U.S. Naval Academy. Conrad invited everyone to attend this year’s Bell football game against Victor Valley High School on September 15 where he predicts the Sun Devils will beat the Jackrabbits for the seventh consecutive year. This was the second year Conrad delivered the same invitation and prediction of a win. ASB president Olivia Collins and senior class president Corey Swearingen addressed their fellow classmates with inspiring words that aligned with the class motto of, “Learn from the past, Excel in the present, Challenge the future.” Collins and Swearingen shared the podium and delivered the message in tandem, with the duo saying “perseverance and joy” were the trademarks of the class of 2017. They two said the lessons learned at AVHS tools will help them “tackle the future” just before Swearingen uttered, “Here comes the cliche — Class of 2017, we did it!” During the ceremony, the SunSations sang “Forever Young” by the group Alphaville as the graduates waves their lighted smartphones in the air. Class co- valedictorians Kalen Ali, Rachel Dobbs, Jacob Ray, Christopher Rosado, Noah Serio and Bethany Tolsma stood next to fellow valedictorian Kameron Carr who addressed the crowd. Carr told fellow classmates that their success at AVHS shouldn’t be based on the expectations of others, because “success is personal.” “From this moment on, follow your own definition of success. Whether your plans include going to college, immediately entering the workforce or carving your own path, you can be successful by taking pride in your hard work,” Carr said. “ The only expectations that matter are your own. Maintain high expectations for yourself and the world is yours.” Rene Ray De La Cruz may be reached at 760-951-6227, RDeLa Cruz@VVDailyPress.com or on Twitter @DP_ReneDeLaCruz.

Footage of an iPhone 8 dummy model hands-on has emerged online, confirming some of the most talked about possibilities for the new Apple flagship device. Posted on YouTube by Benjamin Geskin using the account iVenyaWay, the 10-second footage provides iPhone 8 anticipators a quick-but-meaningful glance at the new Apple device. According to Tech Times, this clip offers clues about what the upcoming flagship device would look like ahead of its release. The video shows a black iPhone with metallic lining on the side where buttons presumably for the volume and phone lock functions. Apple’s iPhone 8 alleged dummy also appears to have no home button or any visible parts that can serve as the Touch ID sensor which may have confirmed some of the early speculations about the new Apple phone. In November 2016, Gadgets 360 reported about rumors going around that Apple is ditching the Home Button for the iPhone 8 which will have an edge-to-edge screen. The article which described the home button as “the most important way of interacting with an iPhone” noted how the Cupertino-based company has taken initial steps towards this goal after the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus were both launched without the physical Home button. [Image by Spencer Platt/Getty Images] “The fact that this year’s iPhone models ditched the physical button with a haptic simulation of a button press, makes the rumor somewhat believable.” With the alleged iPhone 8 dummy model hands-on video surfacing, such rumors may soon become a reality as Benjamin Geskin adds insult to the injury by sharing pictures of the alleged device on Twitter. Check it out. #iPhone8 Dummy pic.twitter.com/YyKJm3a7MO — Benjamin Geskin (@VenyaGeskin1) May 23, 2017 Based on the footage of the iPhone 8 dummy, Apple’s new flagship device will be encased in solid black glass—both front and back—matched with the traditional volume control and power buttons on each of the metal sides. At the bottom is a part which looks like either a mic grille or speaker as well as a port for USB-C or a lightning-like connection. If the subject of the video is really Apple’s iPhone 8 dummy model, Tech Times believes that this could mean that Apple will either embed the sensor under the display like what it did with the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus or trade the Touch ID sensor with an iris scanner. Aside from that, the presence of the physical volume control and power buttons on the sides also debunks the idea that the company is removing all physical buttons. Of course, all that is based on whether or not such dummy model is indeed an authentic copy of the highly anticipated iPhone 8 so it would be best to take such information with a grain of salt. iPhone 8 Release Date & Specs Rumor Round-Up Based on GSM Arena’s collection of rumored specs for the device, iPhone 8 will sport a 4.7-inch Super AMOLED capacitive touchscreen display which is made of ion-strengthened glass with “oleophobic coating.” In terms of memory and RAM, the device is said to have 32, 128, and 256 GB memory variants paired with a 3GB RAM. Its rear camera is pegged to be 12 megapixels that can take 4K video and 8MP image while recording simultaneously. The selfie snapper is rumored to be 7 megapixels, with face detection, HDR, and panorama capabilities. While Tech Times already mentioned the possibility of an iris scanner on Apple’s iPhone 8, the device’s specs in GSM Arena only included a front-mounted fingerprint sensor for its accessibility and security features.

According to Ms Ashley Middleton, who heads the programming for Today at Apple – an initiative offering hands-on educational sessions at the company's stores – the goal is to highlight the local talent, through various categories and their passions.

(Photo: Howard Law)  In Singapore, the immediate focus will be on photography, film, coding, music, art and design, she told Channel NewsAsia on Thursday during a media preview. This can be seen by the programmes lined up on the opening day, with Singapore Idol 3 winner Sezairi Sezali holding an acoustic performance as well as photo walks with photographer Aik Beng Chia, Ms Middleton pointed out.  Live trees take up prominent spots within the store - to provide a sense of nature as well as rest spots for those weary. (Photo: Howard Law)  Coding for children will also take prominence, the Apple executive added, with the Swift programming language - designed specially for the tech giant - to be taught. These sessions are catered to children from the ages of eight to 12, but during the launch of Today at Apple in the US, Ms Middleton said kids as young as four have taken part in the sessions. The aim is to have one to two new local talent coming in to the store every week to hold these educational sessions, she said. Art and design will be one of the main areas of focus for Today at Apple - the initiative to bring educational sessions to Cupertino's brick-and-mortar stores. (Photo: Howard Law)  The sessions will be held on the second floor of Apple Orchard Road store at Knightsbridge Mall, in a space called the Forum, which is equipped with a large screen and break-out tables for hands-on sessions. There are also live trees brought in from China that take prominent positions in the store. These provide shade and rest areas for participants of the sessions, as well as customers looking at the merchandise on the first floor.   iPads and other products on display in Apple's first store in Singapore and Southeast Asia.

Published on May 25, 2017. The next big disruption in digital media is coming from the European Union, but it's not stopping there. Credit: via Wikimedia Commons Most Popular Apple defies industry logic. Apple is the only major tech company with a default assumption that consumers don't want to be tracked or targeted across the web. Its leaders convey a belief that your data is your data until you say otherwise. In a world where data has been called the "new oil," how does Apple side with privacy and stay so rich? Cynics argue that it's because Apple depends less on advertising and commerce. I say it's a benefit of Apple's strategic decision to build trust with its customers. If you work in digital media, you need to know that the industry is one year from taking a big step toward Apple's view. No, this isn't a case of digital disruption coming (once again) from Silicon Valley. In this case, the seismic shift originates in the European Union. Much of the digital media industry is likely to panic over the coming months. But mark my words: The EU will ultimately lead publishers and advertisers to a better place. The most significant change to data privacy regulation in more than two decades will go into effect on May 25, 2018. Under the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR (a mouthful, I know), any company will need to ask for explicit consumer consent to collect and use data across the web and app ecosystem. The GDPR has been described as a new gold standard globally and "extraterritorial" in that it applies to any company that touches personal data of EU citizens -- so everyone needs to pay attention. And the GDPR has teeth: It will prescribe fines equal up to a whopping 4% of global revenue. To put this in perspective, Facebook's fine last week of $130 million (for providing misleading information about its WhatsApp acquisition) could have amounted to more than $1 billion if it happened under these new rules. Amid our industry's uproar over the digital advertising "duopoly" of Google and Facebook, Europe should be applauded for writing the first law that, as a byproduct, may actually change how those companies do business. So how exactly will these rules affect everyone? Let's start with consumers They should always be priority No. 1 (see: Apple). They distrust digital advertising more than any other format for a reason. More and more boycott all of it by installing ad blockers. That's not entirely about privacy, but tracking consistently ranks among consumers' top concerns consumers with online advertising. Though research earlier this year showed that Republicans and Democrats both overwhelmingly supported preserving the FCC's privacy rules for browser histories and other matters, Congress gutted the rules anyway and rapidly heard from their constituents. This may be part of the reason we're seeing regulation at the state level and new bills out of GOP leadership. Bottom-line: People want simple and effective ways to prevent companies from tracking everything they do on their phones and browsers. In fact, 92% of consumers say they don't want their browsing data sold or shared without permission. Just ask yourself, would you? The impact on advertisers is a bit more complex Digital is still mostly a direct-marketing business where advertising is bought at minimal risk, optimized with performance guarantees and targeting to the best audience possible at the lowest possible price. These are the classic rules of direct marketing. And to do it, unsurprisingly, advertisers prefer zero limits on how they can mine and use data across the internet. Trade lobbies like the Direct Marketer Association are happy to explain that more access to your browser data means more relevant ads for you. So, of course, they are concerned about GDPR. Two other significant advertising trends are happening, though, which suggest that these new rules may ultimately benefit advertisers. First, advertisers have peeled back the onion on transparency to see what is really happening in programmatic. And they've learned that intermediaries are often using advertisers' data -- and often their purchasing power -- to benefit their own interests. Economists at Carnegie-Mellon have demonstrated that without privacy rules, intermediaries' interests don't align with the advertising firms that they are supposed to represent. "We find that a strategic intermediary may choose to share with advertising firms only a subset of consumer data," they concluded, "maximizing its profits at their cost." Second, brand advertising -- in which advertisers typically care about the context and use emotion and art to create desire and demand -- is shifting towards digital. This trend is gaining momentum as TV and magazine audiences, the historical venues for brand advertising, begin to decline. But again, there is significant research that brand advertising often fails when solely dependent on targeting. Don Marti has done significant work in pulling together this research. Think of the publishers They are, of course, closest to my well-disclosed interests as I lead a group that represents them. No doubt we've thoroughly documented the significance of the control by the duopoly, particularly as it relates to data collection. Unfortunately, the industry continues to do exactly what the duopoly and ad tech lobbyists demand: We are all complicit in protecting their ability to vacuum data across the web. Allowing the market to enable more and more data collection by third parties hurts us all. Three years ago, I walked through the math on how behavioral targeted advertising is immaterial to publishers in light of solving for bigger issues. Previously, many argued that multi-site behavioral ads were critically important to the funding of high-quality news and entertainment. What we discovered, however, is that these types of ads that collect data across the web were only responsible for approximately three to four percent of publisher revenue. Though open exchanges increasingly take a share by selling surplus inventory, they're also being used as a tool to find audiences at the lowest price available -- significantly cheaper than anything relying upon a publisher directly. And what's worse, they often do so by using the high-quality publisher's brand and audience for a single instance to collect data and retarget in worse contexts for brands. With the addition of header bidding tech, that data can often be collected without even making the winning bid. Think about this for a second: Publishers are allowing ad-tech companies to collect their audience's data and browsing history only to sell ads to these users elsewhere. Publishers also let Facebook (and now Twitter) do this by collecting data whenever Like (or Tweet) buttons show up on any page. Did a publisher ever intend for their audience's entire browsing history to be available to Facebook? I doubt it. But that's what they've granted Facebook in pursuit of Likes. This time next year the GDPR will go into effect and things will inevitably change. The application of this regulation is also likely to eliminate current friction (goodbye to awful EU cookie notices) and offer easy ways to turn consent on or off using long-defined but mostly ignored Do Not Track signals. These are positive developments that put the consumer first and increase trust. But importantly, the GDPR also solves an issue for advertisers and publishers by making intermediaries truly accountable to publishers' customers: advertisers and consumers. As long as the EU doesn't bend to the demands of the powerful platforms, the new privacy rules could actually breathe life and energy back into the economics of the publishing business. Apple wouldn't be surprised.

_ Macworld Australia MAC iPad iPhone iSnap App Guide Gadget Guide mResell HOME NEWS FEATURES REVIEWS HELP/TIPS BLOGS Mac In Business Communications Productivity Security Workflow FORUM MAGAZINE Digital Subscription Current Issue Back Issues WWDC 2017 Wish List: 4 accessibility features Apple needs to add to iOS and macOS Steven Aquino 25 May, 2017 View more articles fromthe author AAA Comments News Jason Snell said it best when he wrote that WWDC is “the heart of the Apple world’s calendar.” Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference is particularly special for me because it’s the event where, as a person with disabilities, I get to see what lies ahead for the accessibility of Apple’s four software platforms. The company has put considerable energy in the last few years into making accessibility a focal point of the conference—from sessions on new APIs to labs to social get-togethers, Apple has gone all out during the week to show that, yes, supporting accessibility is a top priority in Cupertino at the highest levels. With this sentiment in mind, here are four accessibility-related features I’d like to see Apple announce at next month’s keynote. Better Dynamic Type support in the App Store While this wishlist isn’t organized in a particular order of preference, this one has been at the top of my list for years. It’s something I struggle with and gripe over every single day. The problem I have with the iOS App Store (and Apple’s other digital storefronts) is the majority of the text is way too small to read comfortably. Here’s an example: Cultured Code’s Things 3. I went to download the new app after reading good things about it, but I have to squint and strain my eyes in order to read the app description. I could turn on Zoom to remedy this, and I have been lately, but I would prefer Apple add pervasive support for Larger Dynamic Type. What’s so frustrating about this is many of the headings in the App Store (e.g., the Featured page) do support Dynamic Type. It’s strange that the implementation goes only so far—larger text would make reading app descriptions, release notes, and reviews an exponentially more pleasant experience. Dynamic Type on the Mac The 13-inch Touch Bar MacBook Pro—and the Touch Bar’s accessibility support—reinvigorated my enthusiasm for the Mac, and I’ve been using macOS a lot more since the laptop debuted. Similarly to the App Store, I’ve found macOS Sierra to be less than ideal in a few places in terms of visual accessibility. Text in things such as dialog boxes, System Preferences panels, and even the menu bar are all somewhat difficult to read because text size is small. Unlike on iOS, it’s not possible today to adjust text size and have it apply system-wide. And yes, I could use Zoom to make text larger. But I’d rather have the Mac gain support for Dynamic Type, It’s great and I miss it. Dynamic Type on macOS would instantly fix my gripes with text in dialog boxes and the like. (Apple could even add to it to the Mac App Store for good measure.) And like on iOS, Apple could make Dynamic Type a public API on macOS so third-party developers like, say, Flexibits could hook it up to Fantastical. Dynamic Type makes third-party apps better too. A win-win. Larger and Searchable Emojis on iOS Like everyone else, I use emoji often to add color to my iMessage conversations and in my tweets on Twitter. And yet, there are two problems I have in doing so. On the iPhone, emojis are small. Because of this, it’s tough to discern which face is making what expression. Too often I’ve accidentally chosen a wrong or inappropriate face because I couldn’t tell what it was. Exacerbating the problem is the fact the emoji keyboard itself is designed in such a way that it makes it difficult to see which category I’m in. The glyphs on the bottom are small and low contrast. (I can happily report that none of these issues are present on the Touch Bar MacBook Pro or the 12.9-inch iPad Pro. I never have trouble on those devices.) Also, iOS is in dire need of an emoji search function. I’m in complete agreement with Jason Snell on this. Finding them really is the worst. The lack of search actually ties into the size problem—since I can’t search, I have to swipe forever while squinting to find the emojis I want to use. Not good. Please, Apple. If the Mac has emoji search, so should iOS. Dark Mode on iOS For reasons of contrast and legibility, I use dark modes often on my devices. I use it on the Mac exclusively. On iOS, I use it in many third-party apps such as Twitter, Ulysses, and Overcast. Despite having contrast-changing options like Grayscale and Invert Colors, iOS is missing a dark mode. I’d like one. While I generally don’t have any usability concerns with the amount of white space in iOS, I find that I prefer switching between “light” and dark modes depending on the time of day. Light mode during the day, dark mode at night. In the case of Ulysses, I like using dark mode all the time because I think it looks nicer and, functionally speaking, it makes it easier for me to track Markdown syntax as I’m writing. I like to think the white-on-black aesthetic of the Apple Watch companion app on iPhone is a harbinger of a future dark mode. I hope I’m right. Aesthetically and functionally, I really like it. If iOS gets a system-wide dark mode, I’d switch instantly.

Apple Excludes Korean Media from Global PR Bash By Shin Dong-heun Facebook 0 Twitter 0 E-mail More Google+ LinkedIn KakaoStory May 25, 2017 12:33 Apple has not invited Korean media to a global PR junket in California next month over fears of tough new anti-graft rules here. Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference typically sees the spectacular launch of new products. Apple sent out invitations to major media outlets on May 9 to the event in San Jose starting June 5. But Korean journalists who attended last year said they have not received invitations. One reporter said, "I asked Apple and they said sending out invitations this year could violate the anti-graft law." Apple unveils its latest iPhone OS at the bash each year, and CEO Tim Cook delivers a keynote address highlighting the company's new product trends and latest smartphone technology. Apple has sent out invitations to selected journalists, picking up the W1.8 million per person tab that includes airfare, accommodation and other expenses (US$1=W1,126). It is this that could clash with the new anti-graft law, which among other things caps the amount of favors and goodies reporters are allowed to take.

But Samsung designers aren’t the only ones that have exaggerated tales about their creations, and we’ve got one more such example for you. This time around, it comes from an Apple designer, although it doesn’t concern an Apple product. Don't Miss: Somehow, everyone walked away from this massive Tesla crash Marc Newson created a special hourglass for Hodinkee that retails for $12,000. It’s handcrafted, and it contains noisy nanoballs instead of boring sand. No, there’s absolutely no reason to buy one, even if it’s a Newson creation. The hourglass is 150mm tall and 125mm across at the widest point. It contains 1.3 million tiny copper balls that measure just 0.6mm in diameter, and measures precisely 10 minutes. But the way Newson and Hodinkee describe it makes it sound like something that’s actually worth buying/watching/enjoying. It’s not. “Sometimes you see an object, and it just captivates you. You can’t look away. You can’t even really explain what you’re looking at either,” Hodinkee says. “Marc Newson’s Hourglass is one such object. It takes the idea of one of the most basic time-measuring instruments ever devised, and pushes it to its limits.” Alright. “It is perhaps one of the most fundamental objects in the world of timekeeping, and arguably one of the oldest, but I love the fact that it is so sort of deeply esoteric, and it has this strange and mesmeric quality,” Newson says in the promo video at the end of this post. “On one hand, you’re witnessing time. But on the other hand, it’s completely sort of timeless, and it actually if anything focuses your attention on the opposite of time, if that makes any sense.” It doesn’t. And, look, the actual manufacturing of the hourglass is impressive itself. The glass object requires a certain precision, and it’s hand made, which is remarkable. It’s just Hodinkee and Newson’s design stories that are annoying. “Watching the Hourglass is a multi-sensory experience that cannot be communicated in words,” the blog post explains. “The combination of watching those first few nanoballs bounce around the bottom chamber, the flow begin to change surface patterns in the top chamber, and the unique sound of the nanoballs flying around, hitting the glass and one another as they settle at the bottom, is utterly mesmerizing. Invariably, the first time we show it to someone, there’s a gasp, a big smile, and sometimes even a little giggle as they lean in and get ready to watch for the full 10 minutes.” Mkay.

Roz Edward, Michigan Chronicle Managing Editor Posted 17 hours ago Leave a comment 3 reads Apple hired Denise Young Smith, who headed its global human resources program, as its first vice president of diversity and inclusion, CNN reports. Smith started her new position on Monday and will report directly to Apple CEO Tim Cook. Denise Young Smith has been at Apple since 1997 https://t.co/eM12ncGVG8 Via @cnntech — CNNMoney (@CNNMoney) May 24, 2017 Apple’s diversity report states that the company worldwide is 68 percent male. Here in the United States, the tech giant is 56 percent White, 19 percent Asian, 12 percent Hispanic and 9 percent Black. Diversity remains an elusive goal for Apple and the technology industry. Cook told Mashable that the tech community is at “fault” for the gender disparity. “I think in general we haven’t done enough to reach out and show young women that it’s cool to do it and how much fun it can be,” he said. The CEO added that his company is conducting outreach efforts from middle school through college to encourage women to pursue tech careers. Apple is also connecting with historically Black colleges and Universities, he said. TechCrunch reported that Jeffrey Siminoff, who left the company in 2015, was the last person to lead Apple’s diversity efforts. Siminoff, however, held a director role. Smith, as a vice president, is empowered to have greater impact on the company’s initiatives.

Houston Community College will be among the first educational institutions to teach the Apple-designed course in developing applications for the iOS operating system for Macs, iPhones and iPads and other Apple products, the company said Wednesday. The new iOS Coding and Design School at HCC will offer short-term boot camps and programs for degree credits starting in June. "We have been excited about the links they have to the community, to businesses, to government, to everyone there," Apple CEO Tim Cook said about HCC. "Because that means that lots of students will wind up in good jobs." The course builds on Apple's educational programs for K-12 classrooms, as well as a network of iOS app development centers that the company launched in Italy last year. HCC Chancellor Cesar Maldonado said he noticed the iOS development center in Milan about nine months ago and thought Houston should have something similar.

United confronts other issues at annual Upon reaching out to Apple, he learned that the company was already planning a curriculum for community colleges. "There was some magic in the timing," Maldonado said. Although the new Coding and Design School will focus on Apple's Swift programming language, that won't preclude students from learning to create programs for Android phones as well, Maldonado said. "The skills are transferable across devices and platforms." Google, which developed the Android operating system, doesn't have a similar education initiative but hinted that a program is under development. "While we don't have an analogous program we're offering to college students at the moment," Google spokeswoman Charlotte Smith said in an email, "be sure to keep an eye out for updates as we get closer to the next school year." About 1.7 million mobile app developers work in the U.S., according to a study by the Progressive Policy Institute, a center-left think tank in Washington. The Bureau of Labor Statistics counts about 800,000 software developers for apps - which can be either web- or mobile- based - who make a median salary of $100,000 per year. Although consumer-oriented smartphone apps are the most well-known variety, Houston might have a greater demand for developers who can create them for industrial uses, Greater Houston Partnership CEO Bob Harvey said. There are a number of ways to land a job as a mobile developer: You can teach yourself, using various free online tools, or take a course through non-accredited schools like General Assembly or Hack Reactor in San Francisco, New York, Los Angeles and Austin. Those can be expensive, though, and often require taking time off from regular jobs. Those intensive programs aren't available in Houston, which only has a couple of coding schools. Kevin Colten is the chief technology officer for Austin Coding Academy, which has a Houston office at Station Houston, a co-working space downtown. He said demand for courses has been low so far, but that it makes sense for HCC to teach Apple's program. "If you look at the numbers, iOS developers get paid more," Colten said, because Apple products sell at higher prices. In addition, he said, many university app development courses have a hard time keeping up with changes in technology, which an Apple-directed course might be able to avoid. Apple won't provide financial support for the courses, but the curriculum will be free to use for community colleges. It will also be available for free online to any who want to teach themselves. It's a welcome bit of momentum for Houston's nascent tech scene, which got a push last week with the launch of an "Innovation Strategy Office" within the Greater Houston Partnership aimed at boosting the city's startup ecosystem. One of the recommendations in a report from the consulting firm Accenture was for Houston to attract an office of a big Silicon Valley tech firm, such as Apple. Apple employs about 8,400 in Texas. Six thousand of those jobs are in Austin, including the team developing Maps software and other research and development functions. When asked if the company would start an office in Houston, Apple's Cook - who spent a few months in the city in the 1990s while working for Compaq - said Houston should instead focus on having people build applications on top of Apple's platform. "Any city that's looking to expand, whether it's startups or just their tech workforce, my recommendation would be to focus on app development," Cook said.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Forget the iPhone 8: micro-LED screens could power Apple’s future Yoni Heisler BGR News May 24, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share It’s no secret that Apple in recent years has started devoting more and more R&D resources towards researching next-gen display technologies. In 2015, for example, Apple opened up a semi-secretive research lab in Taiwan where a team of 50+ engineers and scientists are tasked with exploring advanced display technologies that would allow Apple to release products with thinner, lighter, and of course, more energy efficient displays. Don't Miss: Don’t let that ugly iPhone 8 model scare you – this is what the real thing will look like Looking ahead, it’s widely believed that Apple’s upcoming iPhone 8 will be the first iPhone model to incorporate an OLED display. Still, it shouldn’t come as much of a surprise that Apple is already looking beyond OLED towards the next big thing. To that end, a new report from Digitimes relays that Apple recently ordered a batch of Micro LED screens for testing in future products. According to the report, Apple may begin trial production on devices with Micro LED displays as soon as this year, though it’s possible trial production might be pushed back to 2018. “Apple has been keen in the development of micro LED technology following its acquisition of LuxVue in 2014,” the report reads, “and recent market speculations also indicate that Apple is likely to crank out a small volume of micro LED display products from its plant in Taoyuan, northern Taiwan at the end of the year.” As for why Apple is interested in micro LED technology, the displays are said to be significantly brighter and far more energy efficient than current OLED display technology. And as smartphones seemingly take on heavier tasks with each passing year, the need for displays that consume less power becomes more and more of a strategic advantage. Interestingly enough, Kleiner Perkins partner John Doerr, while speaking about the Micro LED technology Apple picked up when it acquired LuxVue, intimated a few years ago that the technology represents a “technical breakthrough in displays.” As it stands now, there are challenges associated with building large Micro LED displays, which is to say you shouldn’t expect it to be a feature on Apple’s line of MacBooks anytime soon.

Past meets future of transport. Did you get to this article via Facebook? Or maybe you're reading it right now on an iPhone? Facebook and Apple are two of the biggest companies in the world, and both originate from California. When the box of any Apple product states 'designed in California', it's a sign it's from one of the most innovative parts of the world. Skateboards complete the California look. The history of gaming is broadcast on a screen — from a match of Pong to footage from World of Warcraft. Atari started off in California, and it's home to modern gaming powerhouses like Blizzard. Gaming is everywhere now, but we remember when it was the refuge of nerdy children like us. This circles back to how the Californian approach to technology has made being nerdy or geeky something to aspire to. Can't talk California without Apple and their IPhone. Fitness trackers, virtual reality and GoPro are thrown into the mix too. All that before we even get on to the history of Apple — including old school Macintoshes and the first ever iPhone. It may only be 10 years old, but the speed of technology has dated it fast. This only proves the strength of innovation in California — this place refuses to be left behind. A Shepard Fairey designed poster opposing the immigration ban. But the Golden State's forward thinking hasn't just been through technology. We see how posters promoted equal opportunities for black and LGBT people. There is a recording of Mario Savio's powerful statement on freedom of speech — listening to it send chills down the spine. California: Designing Freedom touches on recent events too; a Shepard Fairey designed image of a Muslim woman wearing a headscarf made from the American flag was used to oppose the recent immigration ban in the US. The show gets a thumbs up from us... or should that be a 'like'? California: Designing Freedom at Design Museum, until 15 October. Tickets are £16 for adults.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Can These Smartphone Giants Make a Mark in Self-Driving Cars? Apple and Samsung have decided to enter the driverless-car race, but how far can they run? Harsh Chauhan (TechJunk13) May 24, 2017 at 9:38PM It looks as if Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) have decided to make a play in the self-driving car market to compensate for a saturating smartphone environment. The iPhone maker fired the first salvo in April, when it received a permit to test self-driving cars in California, where almost 30 companies are already testing their technology. Samsung didn't want to be left behind and joined this crowded bandwagon earlier in May, receiving clearance from South Korean authorities to trial its driverless-car technology. But are these smartphone giants going to cut it despite being late to the driverless-car game? Image source: Samsung.  Samsung was already targeting driverless-car technology Samsung is already involved in making memory chips for self-driving vehicles, such as NAND, DRAM, and memory controllers. What's more, the company's CMOS image-sensor division is also working on object-recognition technology to power advanced driver assistance system applications. But the $8 billion acquisition of Harman International should give some legs to Samsung's driverless-car dreams, giving it access to a team of 8,000 engineers focused on developing cloud-based automotive solutions. The Harman acquisition gives Samsung access to Harman's Life-Enhancing Intelligent Vehicle Solution (LIVS), which was launched last year. The LIVS platform provides end-to-end automotive connectivity using deep-learning techniques for navigation and camera-based driver-assistance systems. This technology should put it in direct competition with NVIDIA's DRIVE PX2 platform, a deep-learning-based supercomputer for autonomous driving. As it turns out, Samsung doesn't have any intention of manufacturing its own cars, according to a statement a company executive issued to Reuters. Instead, the company wants to focus on developing self-driving algorithms based on the principles of deep learning. Of course, NVIDIA has a strong lead in this market, with Tesla already using its platform, while other automakers such as Audi and BMW are also testing the graphics specialist's technology. But Samsung has a chance to hone Harman's driverless expertise in South Korea, where the government is spending $9.7 million to build a model city spanning 360,000 square meters to test autonomous vehicles. The smartphone giant can use this tailor-made project to gather more data to train its software, though only time will tell how many automakers commercially adopt its technology over that from seasoned players such as NVIDIA. Apple's move Apple has never formally acknowledged its self-driving-car ambitions, but recent developments clearly indicate that it is keen on attacking this market. The iPhone maker is going to use three Lexus SUVs to test its self-driving technology on California's public roads. In fact, Apple's car has already been spotted driving around Silicon Valley roads, powered by Velodyne's top-of-the-line LIDAR sensor. Apple remains tight-lipped about its driverless-car ambitions, secretly developing the project in California and Canada, according to a Bloomberg report. However, Bloomberg believes that the company will first focus on the software side of things before thinking about getting into full-fledged car manufacturing, with the final decision on its self-driving-car strategy expected by the end of the year. However, Apple doesn't have any prior expertise in this field, unlike Samsung, so it might take longer than its smartphone rival to build its driverless-car technology. But investors shouldn't forget that Cupertino is sitting on a cash hoard of $250 billion, meaning it has the resources to hire the best engineers to ramp up development. But an easier way will be to acquire a company that's already deep into autonomous-car technology, like Tesla. In his latest research note, Citigroup analyst Jim Suva pinpoints Tesla as a potential acquisition target for Apple. This possibility shouldn't be ruled out, as Tesla CEO Elon Musk met Apple's acquisition chief earlier this year. Apple, therefore, could go from being a laggard to a leader in the driverless-car race if it buys a company that's ahead on the technology curve. Otherwise, it will be difficult for it to keep up with Samsung and the others.  Harsh Chauhan has no position in any stocks mentioned.

(Though, if you want to see what the iPhone 8 will probably look like, click here.) Nope, Apple has begun a project that, once completed, would be transformational in the world of cellular technology: They are actively testing "5G" technology to be put to use on their iPhones. Meaning very, very speedy iPhones. This is big news from the fruit, because if testing is successful, could mean a massive upgrade to your iPhone in the future. (Want to boost your phone right now? Try this cool trick.) Business Insider reported that the technology could "potentially radically increase the speed and bandwidth of an iPhone's cellular connection." I'm sure we all remember the days when we finally got 4G phones and couldn't believe how much faster everything was. Think that, but on a whole other level. Advertisement Advertisement Metashred Newsletter Keep this field blank Enter your email address You may unsubscribe at any time. Privacy Policy | About Us The Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, just made Apple's application to experimentally use the new cellular technology, technically called millimeter wave, public on Tuesday. Business Insider said that the central promise of 5G technology is that "latency will go down, allowing devices to access more bandwidth more reliably than is currently possible with cellular networks." This is great for anyone with an iPhone, especially those who get particularly peeved when they have to wait more than four seconds for something to load on their phone. A "radical" increase to what our phones are capable of doing now is actually hard to fathom. But as we eagerly anticipate this faster, bigger, better world, let's reflect on how far we've come. Remember the days of dial-up? When you could count on enough time to walk to the kitchen, make a roast dinner, drive to the gym, work out for an hour, shower, come back to your computer, and your askjeeves.com search would be about two-thirds of the way loaded?

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Opinions Image Source: Hodinkee Apple designer made a $12,000 hourglass that comes with an iPhone-worthy design story Chris Smith @chris_writes May 24th, 2017 at 9:03 PM Share Tweet Design stories can be pretty silly, and that’s especially true for Samsung’s annoying smartphone design stories — here’s the most recent Galaxy S8 story. But Samsung designers aren’t the only ones that have exaggerated tales about their creations, and we’ve got one more such example for you. This time around, it comes from an Apple designer, although it doesn’t concern an Apple product. Don't Miss: Somehow, everyone walked away from this massive Tesla crash Marc Newson created a special hourglass for Hodinkee that retails for $12,000. It’s handcrafted, and it contains noisy nanoballs instead of boring sand. No, there’s absolutely no reason to buy one, even if it’s a Newson creation. The hourglass is 150mm tall and 125mm across at the widest point. It contains 1.3 million tiny copper balls that measure just 0.6mm in diameter, and measures precisely 10 minutes. But the way Newson and Hodinkee describe it makes it sound like something that’s actually worth buying/watching/enjoying. It’s not. Image Source: Hodinkee “Sometimes you see an object, and it just captivates you. You can’t look away. You can’t even really explain what you’re looking at either,” Hodinkee says. “Marc Newson’s Hourglass is one such object. It takes the idea of one of the most basic time-measuring instruments ever devised, and pushes it to its limits.” Alright. “It is perhaps one of the most fundamental objects in the world of timekeeping, and arguably one of the oldest, but I love the fact that it is so sort of deeply esoteric, and it has this strange and mesmeric quality,” Newson says in the promo video at the end of this post. “On one hand, you’re witnessing time. But on the other hand, it’s completely sort of timeless, and it actually if anything focuses your attention on the opposite of time, if that makes any sense.” It doesn’t. And, look, the actual manufacturing of the hourglass is impressive itself. The glass object requires a certain precision, and it’s hand made, which is remarkable. It’s just Hodinkee and Newson’s design stories that are annoying. “Watching the Hourglass is a multi-sensory experience that cannot be communicated in words,” the blog post explains. “The combination of watching those first few nanoballs bounce around the bottom chamber, the flow begin to change surface patterns in the top chamber, and the unique sound of the nanoballs flying around, hitting the glass and one another as they settle at the bottom, is utterly mesmerizing. Invariably, the first time we show it to someone, there’s a gasp, a big smile, and sometimes even a little giggle as they lean in and get ready to watch for the full 10 minutes.” Mkay.

By Mark Sullivan6 minute Read There are plenty of reasons to take rumors of a new Apple “smart speaker” seriously. Such a product would not only answer a clear desire among consumers to converse with their technology in the home via voice control but also make sense as a new way to interact with existing Apple services. It could be the product that makes Apple’s connected-home vision–which is built around its HomeKit platform, and is still a work in progress–come to life. advertisement But envisioning a theoretical Apple smart speaker is harder than imagining, say, the next iPhone. And it’s dangerous to assume that it would closely resemble the smart speaker the public knows best–Amazon’s Echo, which pioneered the category. In fact, it might be misleading to think of Apple’s home device as a “smart speaker” at all. It may do some of the things we’ve already seen the Echo do, like playing music, delivering news and weather, and providing general “assistant” functions like reminders and traffic reports, but it will feel different. You’ll be able to talk to it, but it’ll serve as an endpoint for a different mix of services in the home, like HomeKit, Apple Music, Siri, and maybe tvOS. In short, it will likely look, act, and think different. Amazon Echo The Center Of The Apple Home Reports about the new Apple device started showing up last year. The most recent, and perhaps most reliable one, comes from KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who, with his sources in Apple’s supply chain of Asian companies, is usually pretty spot-on in his predictions. Kuo suggests the device would be “positioned for the high-end market” and cost more than Amazon’s $179 Echo, and would have a high-quality woofer and seven tweeters. Even if it sounds great, the Apple device’s main job may be acting as a natural-language hub for the Apple connected home. The company’s HomeKit strategy has been brewing for the past few years, but has yet to become a mainstream platform on the level with, say, Apple Music. A natural-language hub could drop right into the center of the HomeKit platform and become the physical device by which consumers might begin to identify with HomeKit. Strictly defined, HomeKit doesn’t currently have a hub that acts as both a central integration point and command center for all the home accessories in the house. Apple says the Apple TV and the iPad currently act as “hubs” because they facilitate away-from-home access to the HomeKit system for iPhone users via the Home app for iOS. But there’s more to being a hub than creating a remote connection. HomeKit currently relies on Bluetooth and Wi-Fi to connect to third-party devices in the home, such as smart lightbulbs. Accessories that don’t support these technologies natively must use a bridge to connect. That’s one reason that the selection of HomeKit devices has been limited. (Apple estimates that there are now about 140 HomeKit-friendly products, including smart-home mainstays such as Philips’ Hue bulbs.) An Apple hub could include built-in support for the Z-Wave, ZigBee, and Thread standards, and the universe of home accessories that HomeKit could connect to would immediately grow much bigger. Philips Hue smart bulbs Kuo believes the device will include a camera for facial recognition, which might help it understand which member of a household it’s dealing with. “The facial recognition piece of the equation may relate to Apple investigating how this entertainment experience can be shared by different people,” wrote Above Avalon analyst Neil Cybart in a recent research note. advertisement Distinguishing between family members might be critical: Google recently added support for multiple household member accounts in its Google Home speaker, using voice recognition to tell who’s who. Creative Strategies analyst Carolina Milanesi told me the days of “one home speaker, one account” are over. It’s Not All About The Cloud Another way an Apple device might be very different than other smart speakers is in the device’s relationship with the cloud. Rather than being dependent on the internet, the HomeKit platform operates on a device level, communicating directly via Bluetooth and Wi-Fi between iPhones, iPads, Apple TV, and third-party accessories in the home; Apple believes constantly moving data constantly moving back and forth from the cloud creates security and privacy issues. A new Apple hub device would have to conform to that same approach, at least where HomeKit functions are concerned. Kuo says in his research note that the Apple smart speaker will have computing power comparable with an iPhone 6 or 6s. It might need that much horsepower because it would be handling a lot of home automation data, and coordinating its use with both other iOS devices and third-party accessories scattered throughout the home. Even if the rumored device functions as a hub, that doesn’t mean it would be marketed as one. It probably wouldn’t be. Instead, it would be marketed with whatever story Apple feels would get it into homes fastest. It could be marketed as an Apple Music device, for example. “Instead of positioning any one of those core technologies or services as the main product, Apple would position them as ingredients to an overall experience found in the entertainment realm,” Cybart wrote in his report. Creative Strategies analyst Ben Bajarin took the idea further in a research brief: “Voice is on the cusp of becoming the mechanism to eliminate the remote with our TV experience.” If an Apple hub provided entirely hands-free control of TV, it would change the Apple TV experience for good. If Not Now, When? KGI Securities’ Kuo said that there’s an “over 50%” chance that this new product will be announced at Apple’s WWDC developer conference starting June 5. But there are also good reasons to believe that the new product might not be announced at the WWDC developer event coming up June 5. The spring event is typically reserved for talking about new stuff in the four major Apple operating systems, and a major hardware product announcement would steal some of that thunder. advertisement On the other hand, it may simply be time to jump into the market. Amazon and Google already have smart speakers. Samsung’s Harman Kardon has announced one powered by Microsoft’s Cortana. There will be others. And they may spur adoption of entire platforms: For instance, if a Google Home shows up on the kitchen counter one day, the family might be tempted to start buying home accessories that work well with it. Google Home Amazon created the smart-speaker category; the Echo has proved remarkably popular with consumers, strongly suggesting that they want to be able to talk to a home device as if it were a person standing in the room with them. But the name “smart speaker” never really fit even the Echo, and as more and more products come out it’ll fit new entrants in the category even less. We’ve already seen Amazon itself aggressively widening the category to include a variety of devices that contain the Alexa brain. In just the past few weeks it’s announced two of them: The Echo Look, a smart mirror that is meant for the bedroom and is more about its camera than anything else. And the new Amazon Show‘s distinguishing feature is its display. In another year, the only things that will still be true of all the devices in this category will be that they’re connected to internet services and can understand and speak natural language in the open air. While Amazon’s Echo has defined the category so far, Apple has a shot at redefining it–as it’s done in the past with MP3 players, smartphones, and beyond.

SECTIONS Home Market Companies Economy Tech Auto Mutual Funds Stocks Currency Opinions Todays Paper E-Paper Horoscope Photos Video Photo Story Home Opinions1234 Giving Apple special sops can cost India dear; here’s how Giving Apple special sops can cost India dear; here’s how The tone of the secretary’s comments suggests the government is working hard to find what it calls ‘common ground’ to enable to the US MNC to set up shop here. By: The Financial Express | Published: May 25, 2017 5:46 AM Under the plan, domestic value addition is to rise to 39.6% of the value of the finished phone by 2019 in the case of smartphones and 58.3% in the case of feature phones. (Reuters) From what the electronics and IT secretary has said to the media, the government appears convinced that if Apple is to do serious manufacturing in India, it has to be allowed to import some part of its components duty-free, at least till the time it is able to source/manufacture them in India. The tone of the secretary’s comments suggests the government is working hard to find what it calls ‘common ground’ to enable to the US MNC to set up shop here. To be sure, if Apple does start manufacturing its phones in India, as opposed to having just an assembly line, it will be a big positive and the duty concessions may well be worth it. But keep in mind that, under the phased manufacturing programme (PMP) the government is working on, the plan is to increase value addition for all players—that is, to move them away from the current assembly-line operations. Under the plan, domestic value addition is to rise to 39.6% of the value of the finished phone by 2019 in the case of smartphones and 58.3% in the case of feature phones. So, if Apple has to get additional concessions such as duty-free imports, other than those given to all handset manufacturers, this can only be allowed if its indigenisation is to be faster—and that concession, too, has to be available to others as well. Also Watch: Even before the government finalises its stand on Apple’s demands, it needs to sort out issues relating to the sops for manufacturing in India. While an 11.5% duty differential was a good reason to start assembling phones here and gradually increasing the local value addition, none of this is possible in the post-GST regime. One possibility being talked of is to hike the import duty on phones/components—currently, the import duty is zero but the countervailing duty is 12.5% for non-manufacturers and 1% for manufacturers. Doing this could be a problem since India is a signatory to the Information Technology Agreement (ITA) which proscribes any import duty—the government, though, feels that ITA can be got around since it does not include smartphones. So, before doing this, the government needs to be very sure this is possible. Another possibility is for the government to compensate manufacturers by refunding them directly—the states where manufacturers are located will also need to chip in since the central government will get just half the 18% GST on handsets, and that won’t be enough. The other option is to give the electronics ministry a budget allocation every year to make these payments. Before global players see a clear tax structure in place, they would be hesitant to set up a full-fledged manufacturing unit. No Comments.

Apple Share By Erik Oster| 6 hours ago Share Last week saw an overall increase in spending on national broadcast campaigns. Advertisers spent nearly $848 million compared with a little over $822 million the previous week, according to Kantar Media. Spending on placement for new creative also rose, from just under $89 million to nearly $122 million. Advertisers spent more on placement during the 2017 Billboard Music Awards than any other programming, devoting $4.9 million, or 4.1 percent of their new creative budget on the event. For the first week of May, Apple spent more on broadcast placement for new creative than any other advertiser, devoting around $10 million to its “The City” spot promoting the iPhone 7 Plus. Last week, Apple returned to the top of the list, devoting 62 percent of its overall broadcast budget of $12.6 million, or nearly $7.9 million, to a series of seven new ads—$6.7 million of that went to three new spots promoting the iPhone 7 Plus, including “Barbers,” a spot showing photos taken with its portrait mode attracting customers to a New Orleans barbershop. Apple also released two Apple Music spots featuring Shakira and Harry Styles and two “Designed for Everyone” brand spots promoting Apple devices. Apple devoted 22 percent of its new creative spending to the Billboard awards, spending a total of $1.7 million on placement during the event, more than any other advertiser, for a total of two minutes of airtime. Its Apple Music ad with Shakira made its debut during the event. It also ran its iPhone 7 Plus spot and another Apple Music spot (the one with Styles), which debuted May 15. Old Navy spent a higher percentage of its overall broadcast placement on new creative than any other advertiser, devoting 91 percent of its approximately $7 million budget, or nearly $6.4 million, to the latest in its “Hi, Fashion” campaign. The brand devoted $836,000 of its spend on placement of the 30-second “Hi, Light” ad promoting its “Summer Essentials” event during NBC’s The Voice. The third biggest spender on new creative last week, Mercedes-Benz, spent just over $4.1 million to promote its C-Class series. That represented 62 percent of the Daimler AG brand’s overall media budget of around $6.6 million. Mercedes May 2017 from Kantar Media US on Vimeo. Mercedes just edged out the next advertiser on the list, AT&T. The telecommunications giant devoted around $4 million of its $9 million broadcast placement budget on a new version of a spot in the “Terms & Conditions” campaign it launched last month starring Mark Wahlberg. While not a new ad, that version of “Unlimited” included an iPhone 7 offer, which technically qualifies it as “new creative,” and $684,000 of AT&T’s spend for the ad was for placement during PGA Tour golf. Lowe’s rounded out the list of the top five biggest spenders on broadcast placement on new creative at around $3.6 million. That was good for 54 percent of the hardware chain’s budget of nearly $6.7 million. Lowes May 2017 from Kantar Media US on Vimeo.

A research note from analysts at Morgan Stanley estimates that Waymo could be worth as much as $70 billion in a few years. By Rex Crum | rcrum@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group PUBLISHED: May 24, 2017 at 3:51 pm | UPDATED: May 24, 2017 at 3:52 pm Top of the Order:   That’s a Lot of Waymo: When it became known that Google was getting into the self-driving car market, there was no doubt that the company was going to do something notable. The first notable thing was naming the technology venture Waymo. Maybe it’s supposed to mean, “Way More than what anyone else is doing?” What it might mean, however, is, “Way More than what anyone else is worth.” Because according to analysts from Morgan Stanley, Waymo could be worth $70 billion. Related Articles Biz Break: Google’s getting to know you, and what you buy, better than ever Google email suggests a company tip line for exposing leakers Biz Break: AT&T strike may close your local store this weekend Biz Break: Investors feed on latest Pandora sale reports Biz Break: Apple gets cranking on iPhones in India The Morgan analysts, Brian Nowak and Adam Jonas, said in a research note this week that Waymo’s new deal with ride-sharing company Lyft could provide the impetus for Waymo’s big potential valuation. Of course, that $70 billion figure won’t be attainable overnight. Nowak and Jonas said Waymo could get there if it ends up being responsible for 1 percent of all the miles driven worldwide in 2030. That’s a lot of miles to go. Just to put things in a bit of perspective, the U.S. Department of Transportation said that in 2016, American drivers alone put 3.2 trillion miles on the road. So, it’s safe to say that the number of miles Americans drive will increase substantially in another 13 years. And by then, Waymo could be big enough for Google to spin out on its own. Waymo is considered one of Google’s “other bets.” If it manages to reach that $70 billion valuation, or anything close to it, Waymo may turn out to be a bet that was worth placing. Middle Innings: Diversifying Apple: For all its history of developing products that change industries and create fiercely loyal customers, Apple has, at times, been a little slow on the draw regarding some matters. For example, Steve Jobs was never big on Apple paying out dividends during his time running Apple. In fact, Apple went from 1995 until 2012 without paying any dividends at all. Granted, part of that period included when many weren’t sure how long Apple would even be around. And for a company that touts its commitment to diversity, Apple hadn’t been in a rush to hire someone to oversee its diversification efforts. Until now, that is. Apple said it has named Denise Young Smith as its first vice president for inclusion and diversity. Smith is a 20-year Apple employee and is moving into her new job from her position as Apple’s vice president of worldwide human relations. Workman’s Comp?: Tesla has been a leader in the advancement of electric cars gaining popularity among consumers — at least among those who can afford one of Tesla’s vehicles. All those cars don’t get built without the workers at Tesla’s assembly plant in Fremont. And with all those workers doing their thing, accidents are bound to happen. But, a new study by the workplace group Worksafe found that work-related accidents involving Tesla employees were almost one-third higher than those at other automakers. The study, commissioned by Tesla, has the potential to add to employee efforts to unionize at the electric carmaker. Bottom of the Lineup: It was another upbeat day for investors as all the major stock indexes ended the day with respectable gains. The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite Index rose 0.4 percent to 6,163.02. The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average also added 0.4 percent to finish the session at 21,012.42. And the broad-based Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 0.3 percent to 2,404.39. Quote of the Day: “There is a severe affordability problem in the Bay Area.” — Andrew LePage, a research analyst with real estate information service CoreLogic. LePage was speaking about a CoreLogic report that showed median prices for Bay Area homes have hit an all-time high. Sign up for the 60-Second Business Break newsletter at www.siliconvalley.com.

Following the update, Apple TV users can watch live 360 degree videos directly on their television sets, navigating through the scene with the Siri remote. The new version of the Twitter app for Apple TV also includes support for the Periscope Global Map, letting users find user-created Periscope content from around the world. Much of Twitter's television content comes from its content deals, but there is also a wealth of user-generated video sourced from Periscope that can be watched within the Twitter for Apple TV app. Along with an update to its Apple TV app, Twitter has also updated its iOS app. As noted by TechCrunch, the iOS update offers up new settings to connect a Twitter account stored on an iOS device to the Apple TV, letting users view their Twitter account on the Apple TV. There's one other Twitter update, which includes support for Emoji 5.0. Emoji 5.0 was released in March and includes emoji like grinning face with star eyes, vomiting face, face with raised eyebrow, elf, mermaid, zombie, giraffe, pretzel, and more. While Twitter has implemented support for the new emoji, Apple has not, so these characters are only visible when using Twitter for web. Twitter for iOS can be downloaded from the App Store for free.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Tablets Image Source: eBay You can buy a prototype iPad right now for $5,000 Mike Wehner @MikeWehner May 24th, 2017 at 8:00 PM Share Tweet The original Apple iPad was the tablet that made tablets cool, launching us into an age where huge touchscreens are the norm and long flights are a bit more bearable because of it. If you’re an Apple diehard and, for some reason, an iPad maniac, you can now own one of the rarest Apple tablets on the planet: an internal prototype of the very first iPad. The only catch is that you’ll have to shell out way more than you’ve ever considered paying for a tablet. Don't Miss: Don’t let that ugly iPhone 8 model scare you – this is what the real thing will look like The device, which is currently up for sale on eBay with a Buy It Now price of $5,000, is a 16 GB version of the first generation iPad. However, unlike every other iPad filling virtual store shelves around the web, this one was meant for internal Apple use only, according to the seller. The tablet has an unsearchable serial number and lacks any of the typical markings you’d normally find on the back of an Apple tablet. Likewise, the iPad doesn’t run the typical iOS operating system, and is instead equipped with SwitchBoard, which is Apple’s internal software used for testing and diagnostics.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple Seeks License from FCC Covering new Wireless Millimeter Wave Technology Found in a Recent Patent Filing | Main May 24, 2017 Apple was the first to deliver a MacBook with only USB-C Ports and now Intel will be bringing this to the PC in 2018   Apple was of course first to deliver a MacBook with only USB-C ports. Not that everyone was happy about that shift, in fact the critics hammered Apple for that "innovation." The cover of the WSJ story mocked the move, as noted below. Now Intel is bringing this solution to the PC World via Thunderbolt 3. Dan Riccio, Apple's senior vice president of Hardware Engineering said that "Apple and Intel have collaborated on Thunderbolt from the beginning, and as the industry leader in its adoption, we applaud Intel's efforts to integrate Thunderbolt technology into its CPUs and open it up to the rest of the industry."     Intel notes in their press release that their original vision for Thunderbolt was not just to make a faster computer port, but a simpler and more versatile port available to everyone. Intel envisions a future where high-performance single-cable docks, stunning photos and 4K video, lifelike VR, and faster-than-ever storage are commonplace. A world where one USB-C connector does it all – today, and for many years to come. With this vision in mind, Intel announced today that it plans to drive large-scale mainstream adoption of Thunderbolt by integrating Thunderbolt 3 into future Intel CPUs and by releasing the Thunderbolt protocol specification to the industry next year.   With Thunderbolt 3 integrated into the CPU, computer makers can build thinner and lighter systems with only Thunderbolt 3 ports. For the first time, all the ports on a computer can be the same – any port can charge the system and connect to Thunderbolt devices, every display and billions of USB devices.   Designs based on Intel's integrated Thunderbolt 3 solution require less board space and reduce power by removing the discrete component needed for existing systems with Thunderbolt 3.   In addition to Intel's Thunderbolt silicon, next year Intel plans to make the Thunderbolt protocol specification available to the industry under a nonexclusive, royalty-free license.   Releasing the Thunderbolt protocol specification in this manner is expected to greatly increase Thunderbolt adoption by encouraging third-party chip makers to build Thunderbolt-compatible chips. We expect industry chip development to accelerate a wide range of new devices and user experiences.   Microsoft has enhanced Thunderbolt 3 device plug-and-play support in the now available Windows 10 Creators Update. Intel and Microsoft plan to continue to work together to enhance the experience in future versions of the Windows operating system.   "Microsoft and Intel are working together to enable Thunderbolt 3 on Windows PCs to deliver on the 'if it fits, it works' potential of USB-C," said Roanne Sones, general manager, Strategy and Ecosystem for Windows and Devices at Microsoft. "The Windows 10 Creators Update enhanced plug-and-play support for Thunderbolt 3 devices, with additional enhancements planned for future OS releases."   State-of-the-Art Single-Cable Docks   Mobile platforms continue to get thinner, lighter and more powerful. The challenge? A simple and universal way to unleash the full performance of these mobile devices when docked. Today, business and home users are forced to choose between performance and mobility.   Thunderbolt 3 docks enable mobility without compromise. Some people are more productive with a large high-resolution monitor, and others with multiple monitors. Only Thunderbolt 3 docks support both, while simultaneously transferring large files and charging the notebook. Other people want a simple way to play and create, and Thunderbolt 3 docks can connect to any compatible peripheral or display, avoiding confusion. The power Thunderbolt 3 brings to docking is speed and simplicity. Some of these products are available now for less than $200.   Faster-than-Ever Storage   The amount of data the average person creates, uses and saves these days is exploding. For example, taking 1,000 high-resolution photos can quickly create over 20GB of data. Likewise, shooting an hour of 4K video from a drone can generate a jaw-dropping 1.5TB of data. It could take hours to transfer this data to storage via conventional methods.   In order to speed up data transfer, storage makers are shifting from slower Serial ATA (SATA) drives to non-volatile memory (NVMe) SSDs for higher speed and lower latency storage solutions. For any media lover or YouTuber generating large amounts of data, there is often a great need for external storage that is as fast as the internal SSD to expand capacity. Since only Thunderbolt can connect NVMe SSDs to your PC, Thunderbolt 3 storage fulfills this need and enables people to save time with data transfers that happen in a snap. A full 4K movie can be transferred in less than 30 seconds.   Epic Gaming   Gaming desktops will continue to offer best-in-class performance for the ultimate gaming experience. And gamers who want to combine mobility and performance gaming in one device can use Thunderbolt 3 to do so.   With Thunderbolt 3, gamers can travel, work or enjoy long hours at a coffee shop with a thin and light notebook. Then, when it's time for epic gaming, the notebook can be paired with a Thunderbolt 3 external graphics box to get a GPU boost for higher resolution and settings experience.   Lifelike Virtual Reality   When a person experiences virtual reality, they are fully immersed in a different world. The higher the resolution, the better the experience. To date, that has required multiple cables to transfer the experience from the PC to the headset in real time for 2K resolution. Only Thunderbolt 3 can deliver up to 4K resolution in virtual reality with a single cable.   The benefits are endless – simplicity to performance to versatility – as Thunderbolt 3 becomes an essential part of our digital world by creating a universe of possibilities.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Anthony Caruana May 25, 2017, 9:30am ⋅ Filed to:  Australian Stories gartner smartphones Share Samsung and Apple have enjoyed dominance of the smartphone market for some time. But that is changing according to data from Gartner. Both companies saw their quarterly shipments fall compared to the same period last year with their rivals Huawei, Oppo and Vivo all showing solid growth over the same period. Although shipments were up overall, Samsung, Apple and the largest vendor of all, "Others" all saw their share fall. And while Huawei and Vivo did well, the big mover was Oppo, which almost doubled it's sales volumes. While Apple and Samsung are still dominant, neither has been able to gain a massive foothold in China. And the challengers have been buoyed by some nice devices that offer a balance between price and features. Of course, sales numbers are just one part of the equation. As Apple's fans are quick to point out, Apple's profits are solid and their margin per unit remains quite high. In contrast, the 86.3% market share held by Android (Windows Phone and Blackberry's share by OS is negligible) is influenced by that platforms strength in low cost and pre-paid handsets.

Apple is halfway between releases and Q1 was immediately before Samsung's biggest flagship release in April. Sales always dip just prior to a major release as people hold off. As Apple's fans are quick to point out, Apple's profits are solid and their margin per unit remains quite high. Regardless of the company, it takes a special kind of blindness to think high margins are in any way a good thing for consumers.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Site Archive Despite calculation errors, Apple Valley claims highest water rates in region Wednesday May 24, 2017 at 4:20 PM May 24, 2017 at 6:29 PM Matthew Cabe Staff Writer @DP_MatthewCabe APPLE VALLEY — A chart the town released last week that compares the monthly residential water rates of Liberty Utilities against those of five other local providers contains errors, the Daily Press has learned. Rates for Golden State Water Company’s Apple Valley customers were correct, according to Golden State spokesperson Mike Gazda, but rates for Hesperia, Victorville and the Helendale Community Services District were incorrect. Despite the errors, town spokesperson Kathie Martin said the “bottom line” remains that “Liberty still has the highest water rates in the region by a large margin.” The chart shows a “total monthly charge” for customers of each provider at three usage levels, 11.65, 12.64 and 16.45 CCF. One CCF — 100 cubic feet — is equal to 748 gallons. Liberty’s rates are shown at $70.20, $74.61 and $92.43, according to the town’s calculations. Company officials have not responded to confirm the accuracy of those figures. Hesperia spokesperson Rachel Molina said “two of the calculations were correct" for that city's rates. She added that the first — $22.19, according the the town — was not. Molina provided a revised chart listing a monthly charge of $31.19 for 11.65 CCF of water. The $9 difference was the result of a calculation error, according to Martin. The town’s chart had Victorville’s rates at $46.07, $47.59 and $53.42; however, city spokesperson Sue Jones said the three should be $32.16, $33.89 and $40.55. “These figures are based on a consumptive rate of $1.749 for standard domestic water and a monthly service charge of $11.78 for ¾-inch (meter),” Jones said. “So for 11.65 CCF (multiplied by) $1.749 (plus) $11.78 (equals) $32.16.” All calculations factored in a service charge and assumed a ⅝ x ¾-inch meter size except rates for the Helendale Community Services District (CSD), “which lists only (one-inch) meters,” the town’s chart shows. Initially the chart had the CSD’s rates at $36.88, $37.82 and $41.44. CSD Program Director Cheryl Vermette provided figures that showed the town’s calculations were off by $0.69 in each case. Martin later provided a revised chart with rates that also differed from those obtained from the CSD; however, Vermette confirmed the new rates were accurate. She added the CSD rounds down its per CCF usage. For example, residential usage totaling 11.65 CCF would round down to 11 CCF. The updated chart shows current CSD rates at $36.33, $37.28 and $41.08. A town statement also issued last week said the chart was released "in an effort to keep citizens informed about water rates in the town and in nearby areas.” Mayor Scott Nassif said the “water rate comparison chart proves what the Town Council has been hearing for the past several years.” “Liberty is charging far more for water than any of its competitors in the town or in nearby communities,” Nassif said. “We cannot understand and Liberty has never adequately explained why it charges our citizens so much more for water.” Town Manager Frank Robinson added that the chart “does not even show the additional charges for and the countless surcharges imposed by Liberty Utilities.” “The burden on our residents is far too great,” he said. Greg Sorensen — president of Liberty Utilities’ Western Region — said how private and municipal water providers charge customers does not allow for an “apples-to-apples” comparison because the cost to connect to systems are recouped differently. “Typically, most of the municipalities in the High Desert have fee schedules, and there is a payment,” Sorensen said. “With Liberty or Golden State, there is no charge. That cost is built into the water rate over the cost of the service." He added that fees are included in mortgages in municipally run areas. “I don’t look at it as a right (versus a) wrong, but it is different,” Sorensen said. “With the investor-owned model, there’s only one fee and that’s the water rates. There’s no other source of income for the company. It’s all in the water rate. “(Under municipal ownership) those (fees) can be $5,000 to $10,000 to connect to that system ... It’s always done having forgot that (the) price is rolled into your mortgage ... So if you do a comparison between the two, you have to take that into account when doing the comparison.” Sorensen said when an "all-in cost" is considered, Liberty's rates are comparable to those of other providers in the region. Representatives for San Bernardino County Service Area 64 (Spring Valley Lake) were also asked to confirm the accuracy of rates included in the initial chart, but they did not respond immediately.

REUTERS/Mike Segar/File Photo    Next iPhone Could Be 535 Times Faster Than What You’re Used To [VIDEO] Anders Hagstrom 6:43 PM 05/24/2017      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP Apple applied to test a 5G network that can download a 120-minute movie in less than one second, the FCC announced Tuesday. With both AT&T and Verizon planning to have operable 5G networks within the year, Apple’s FCC application solidifies the next step in having iPhones operate on a 5G network. AT&T has been testing its 5G Network since January. “Data on our mobile network has increased about 250,000% since 2007,” chief strategy officer John Donovan said. “The majority of that traffic is video. 5G’s promise of greater speed and overall network performance brings huge opportunities.” So far, Verizon has demonstrated the most robust 5G connection, conducting a test in which the tech giant broke a record with its 6.4gbps connection in a moving car, BGR reported Monday. For reference, that’s 535 times faster than today’s best connections, which only offer 5-12 megabits per second. This will allow users to stream and download higher-quality video with amazing speed, but it’s likely to cost more as well. WATCH: [/youtube] AT&T and Verizon aren’t the only wireless companies developing 5G, however; Nokia claims its prototype 5G network has achieved peak speeds of 30Gbps, which is more than most people could even begin to use on their phone.

Macs & Mac OS X | 15 May 2017 | Print  | Comment (11) Apple Releases macOS 10.12.5, iOS 10.3.2, watchOS 3.2.2, and tvOS 10.2.1 by Josh Centers Focusing on bug and security fixes, Apple today updated all of its operating systems: macOS 10.12.5, iOS 10.3.2, watchOS 3.2.2, and tvOS 10.2.1. As always, it pays to wait at least a few days to install these updates. We haven’t heard of any problems out of the gate, but Apple was so parsimonious with release notes that it’s hard to muster much enthusiasm for updating right away. It’s best to err on the side of caution this time. macOS 10.12.5 -- macOS 10.12.5 Sierra is available via Software Update, where it’s a roughly 894 MB download. Alternatively, you can instead download a delta updater (for 10.12.4, 2.15 GB) or combo updater (from any version of 10.12, 2.15 GB). Release notes are sparse, but practically long-winded compared to the notes for the other OS updates. Identified improvements include a fix for an issue where audio may stutter when played through USB headphones, a mysterious claim of enhanced Mac App Store compatibility with future updates, and added support for media-free installations of the Windows 10 Creators Update in Boot Camp. macOS 10.12.5 includes 30 security fixes. iOS 10.3.2 -- The roughly 200 MB iOS 10.3.2 update can be installed in Settings > General > Software Update or via iTunes. However, the release notes say only, “iOS 10.3.2 includes bug fixes and improves the security of your iPhone or iPad.” Remember when we reported on the bugs that caused Mail to ignore named anchors like the article list at the top of TidBITS issues (see “Mail in El Capitan and iOS 9 Ignores Named Anchors,” 5 January 2016)? Apple did fix the problem in Mail in Sierra at some point, but the company didn’t address it in iOS 10, and it remains unfixed in iOS 10.3.2. If only we could make the case that it was a security vulnerability. iOS 10.3.2 integrates 23 security fixes. watchOS 3.2.2 -- Don’t expect more detail from the watch OS 3.2.2 release notes, which offer only the even terser, “This update includes improvements and bug fixes.” You install the 41.7 MB update via the Watch app on your iPhone (in Watch > Settings > General > Software Update). Remember that the Apple Watch must be on its charger, charged to at least 50 percent, and within range of your iPhone, which itself must be on Wi-Fi. Don’t start installing if you’ll want to use the watch again within an hour or so — watchOS updates take surprisingly long to load. watchOS 3.2.2 features 10 security fixes. tvOS 10.2.1 -- With the tvOS 10.2.1 update, Apple is willing to cop only to “This update includes general performance and stability improvements.” You can get the tvOS 10.2 update on your fourth-generation Apple TV via Settings > System > Software Updates > Update Software. tvOS 10.2.1 offers 14 security fixes.   Fujitsu ScanSnap Scanners — Save your business time and money with our easy-to-use small ScanSnap Scanner line.

It was, and the iPad otherwise seems in working order too. Phew. Reply Dennis B. Swaney  2017-05-15 19:08 Hmmm, if the fixes aren't important enough for Apple to list, then they aren't important enough for me to waste time installing them and the possibility they will brick my iDevices. Reply Simon  2017-05-15 19:46 I'd have to agree with that. Apple not telling people what they update (a simple list would be fine) but expecting users to just follow blindly is simply rude. No wonder power users are so cautious to update. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-15 20:22 From the bug fix standpoint, that's certainly true, and we don't recommend installing it now. But you really do want to install it at some point, since there are a bunch of security fixes, which Apple does describe. Reply Phil Seymour  2017-05-15 21:43 I read the 30 security fixes for OSX or whatever they want to call Sierra these days. It seems that the same sloppy coding that doesn't enable all the functions in software programs since the last update is responsible for a bunch of holes in the security of most everything. It's a good thing I did a complete backup last night so I can reinstall some previous version in case this update is just like the last one. Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc  2017-05-15 23:39 Right. Backing up is good to do, or something like that. It should go without saying that heads-up TidBITS readers always back up before applying an update/upgrade, unfortunately that's not the case. Forewarned is forearmed, however. If you don't back up your system before one of these updates, any trouble you encounter is your own darn fault. Your negligence is not Apple's responsibility. Of course we'd like to know if you do run into trouble so we can know what to look out for. It's also good to know what's fixed. For instance, has Apple resolved any more of the issues with PDFKit? I would hope to hear about this from some TidBITS contributors who have reported on the problems with recent versions of the macOS and PDF documents. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-16 10:26 What I'd really hope is that TidBITS readers would know to have a backup strategy that involves a constantly updated Time Machine backup, a nightly bootable duplicate, and an off-site backup done via CrashPlan or Backblaze. Then, no matter what, it's easy to restore even if things go south with an upgrade. :-) Reply nick304  2017-05-17 18:53 Totally agree about not knowing about PDFKit. This is the one thing which has totally stopped me from upgrading to Sierra, and I won't do so until I know for certain that the PDFKit problems have been resolved. It really frustrates me that Apple do not acknowledge the problems and address the status of the fixes in their release notes. I know they don't like admitting fault, but I depend on PDFs and need to know the OS is not going to screw them up - I can't afford the hassle of them being broken. Reply Jon Hall  2017-05-16 06:20 That list of changes is a sight for sore eyes. Long may they continue (and grow in substance)! Thank you, Apple! Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-24 17:05 I've now checked in with my sources, and the word on PDFKit changes in 10.12.5 is that there don't seem to be any. No one saw any fixes, either to older bugs or those introduced in 10.12.4. See http://tidbits.com/article/17152 Reply Duane  2017-05-24 18:57 Obviously others have had better results, but I've tried to install the latest Mac OS update, and the Mac won't complete the installation or boot. I had to boot from a Carbon Copy clone and copy it to the internal disk. I also tried using the recovery disk to do a complete system install, with the same result. I'd be glad if anyone can suggest a solution. Reply To leave a comment, click Add a Comment and then enter the text, your name, and your email address (which won't be displayed).

The post has since been taken down, but initially included the caption: “How did I end up in the studio with Dr Dre ON THE night his deal went public that he did with Apple 3.2 BILLION!!!!! The BEATS HEADPHONES JUST CHANGED HIP HOP!!!!!!” WATCH: The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Financial Times reported the story Thursday citing sources briefed on the talks. Beats by Dre headphones‘ annual sales revenues have reportedly gone up to $1.5 billion since the company was founded with music executive Jimmy Iovine began selling headphones in 2008. The deal would include the new Beats Music streaming service, which Apple is likely acquiring to compete with streaming services like Pandora and Spotify after the company’s iTunes Radio failed to impress the industry. Apple’s revenue growth has declined sharply in recent years, and the company only entered the broadly popular streaming market last year — late because of former CEO Steve Jobs’ reported unfavorable opinion of music subscription services. The company continues to be the largest seller of music downloads, but is losing market share to companies like Amazon. Purchasing Beats would mark Apple’s largest acquisition ever. The headphones retail between about $169.95 to $449.95, depending on model and features, and despite many music and sound industry experts describing their quality as “extraordinarily bad,” the brand has become enormously popular as a fashion item among a younger consumer base, and the popular alternative to standard earbuds models. Beats’ success is due in large part to its wide profit margins – despite the steep prices of the popular bass-heavy headphone models, each individual unit reportedly only costs around $14 to produce. Private equity firm Carlyle Group invested $500 million in Beats last year, and valued the company at more than $1 billion. Neither Apple nor Beats would comment on the deal in the original reports, and the briefed sources said they were still in the negotiation stage. Though the companies have yet to consummate the agreement, and it could still fall through, if things go as planned the official announcement could be made as early as next week.

In a statement, Internet Association spokesman Noah Theran said the group was "tracking" the proposal. "This bill has the potential to upend the consumer experience online and stifle innovation," Theran said. "Policymakers must recognize that websites and apps continue to be under strict [Federal Trade Commission] privacy enforcement and are not in an enforcement gap, unlike other stakeholders in the ecosystem." ADVERTISEMENT Earlier this year, Congress voted to kill a set of Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules that would have imposed similar restrictions on internet service providers, but not websites that share consumer data with advertisers. Blackburn said that her bill would put all of the internet ecosystem under a uniform set of privacy rules. "I thought the Internet Association would be more supportive of protecting consumers," Blackburn said in a statement to The Hill. "I think if you ask the American people if they're ok with having less control over their online privacy so companies can sell their data -- they'd say no." Read more here.

APPLE SEES INCREASE IN SECURITY REQUESTS: Apple says the number of United States government requests for user data skyrocketed in the second half of 2016. The computer and phone company released its twice-yearly transparency report Tuesday evening, showing that the number of National Security Letters more than doubled between the first and second half of 2016. National Security Letters are similar to warrants but don't require the same evidentiary standard or approval from a judge for an agency to issue. According to the report, between 5,750 and 5,999 National Security Letters were issued for data from 4,750 to 4,999 different accounts. National Security Letters (NSLs) usually contain a nondisclosure clause preventing a company like Apple from releasing information on the letters, even to the users whose account has been requested. Companies can, however, issue reports giving a range of possible numbers. Read more here.

Madrigal May 24, 2017 Technology Share Tweet … LinkedIn Email Print Text Size Over the last 20 years, the technology industry has become the most powerful industry in the world, boasting seven of the 20 most profitable companies. Last year, Apple literally doubled the profits ($53.4 billion) of the second-most profitable company, J.P. Morgan Chase ($24.4 billion). And when it comes to market value, tech companies sweep the top five: Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Facebook. These companies are not only huge and profitable; they’re also growing. By most measures, though not all, this power is concentrated in one specific region, the Pacific Coast, and even more tightly centralized in the San Francisco Bay Area. Incredibly, three of those five most valuable companies are located in three adjacent little towns in Silicon Valley. The total distance from Facebook in Menlo Park to Alphabet (née Google) in Mountain View to Apple in Cupertino is just 15 miles. These companies—with apologies to Intel, Oracle, and Cisco—have become the Big Three of Silicon Valley. Detroit had a Big Three for decades: General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler. They were also amazingly profitable, industry-leading, and birthed a global industry. In the late 1950s, these three companies had over 90 percent market share in the U.S. car market, which was also the world’s largest. Now, companies from a similarly small region occupy a similarly dominant role in the economy, which has powered economic growth over the last several decades. But a comparison between Detroit’s Big Three and Silicon Valley’s shows how much the economy around any individual company or place has changed. * * * Investors now value tech as they once valued automotive (and oil) companies. It was the IPO of the decade. Thousands of people flocked to brokers hoping to get their hands on some of the paper from one of the century’s most innovative and respected companies. Finally, finally, the common person could share in the wealth generated by the genius of … Ford. The year was 1956, and Ford, privately held since its inception by the Ford family and (later) the Ford Foundation, was accessing the public markets. More than 10 million shares went on the market and were immediately snatched up by hundreds of thousands of investors at an opening price of $64.50. The Ford Foundation made $642.6 million in the sale. It was the biggest IPO ever, as befit the automotive industry, which was the biggest in everything around the mid-century. Likewise, at the time Ford went public, the true behemoth of the American economy, General Motors, was the nation’s most valuable stock, running $263.27. And for good reason. These companies make a ton of money. In the second (1956) edition of the Fortune 500, Ford held the third slot in revenue and profit. That year, the company made $437 million dollars. General Motors took the top spot by becoming the first company to break $1 billion in profit that year ($1.19 to be exact). Only 16 companies even made $100 million in 1956. Chrysler was the least profitable of those companies, eking into the echelon with $100.1 million in profits. The only rival the car industry had was the oil industry, which had the number-two company on Fortune’s list, Exxon Mobil, as well as seven others in the top 20 most profitable companies. All this to say: making cars and fueling them dominated the American profit-making enterprise. Hell, even the two big tire manufacturers were among the top 35 profit-makers of 1956. Cars were national. Tech is global. But there are crucial differences between Detroit’s Big Three and Silicon Valley’s. One is that Silicon Valley’s companies are fully global enterprises. Since 2015, the majority of Facebook’s ad revenue comes from overseas. Apple crossed that threshold in the first quarter of 2010, and now roughly two-thirds of the company’s revenue comes from abroad. Google, too, has long made a majority of its money outside the U.S., though its home country represents nearly half its revenue. In fact, all the money that these companies are making overseas is one reason why they are valued so highly, Harvard Business School’s Shane Greenstein told me. “Since the election, the markets have factored in a presumed ‘tax holiday’ that allows firms to repatriate their foreign earnings without U.S. taxes,” Greenstein said. “That especially shapes the values of Apple and Google.” Since the election, Facebook is up 11 percent, Google is up 21 percent, and Apple is up a gobsmacking 34 percent. Perhaps this is even more remarkable, given that tech company employees gave Hillary Clinton 60 times the money they gave to Donald Trump ($3 million to $50,000). The tech labor force is a tiny fraction of the automotive industry’s. The other crucial difference is that tech’s leading companies employee far fewer people than Detroit’s Big Three did. This point can be made in the single chart above,  but it’s worth unpacking in three ways. One, even though the big industrial giants did employ a lot of people, by the 1950s they were already automating away some of the jobs that they’d just created by building huge factories. “Between 1948 and 1967—when the auto industry was at its economic peak—Detroit lost more than 130,000 manufacturing jobs,” the historian Thomas J. Sugrue has written. To me, that’s startling. This was the absolute golden age of manufacturing, yet in the seat of the most important industry, companies were shedding jobs. Two, the car companies’ employees were far more concentrated in Detroit and the surrounding cities than the tech companies’. Apple only has 25,000 employees in the “Santa Clara Valley.” Google likely has around 20,000 at its home. And let’s call it at around 6,000 Facebook folks in Menlo Park. Three, the tech companies have many, many, many subcontractors, from content moderators in the Philippines to manufacturing people at Foxconn in China to custodians on their own campuses to bus drivers dragging people up and down from San Francisco. The way modern companies work, they try to keep employees off their own balance sheets unless absolutely necessary, especially lower-wage workers. The original Big Three were the motive power for a whole region’s economy. By employing so many people at decent wages, they created broad-based prosperity. In Silicon Valley, the wealth that the Big Three create goes to a much smaller slice of the population, building wealth for thousands instead of hundreds of thousands of workers. In 2016, Facebook generated $600,000 of net income per employee. That is to say, the tech world, for all its disruptions, is a supercharged example of how the American economy as a whole works right now: The skilled and the already rich make huge amounts of money, and everyone else gets the leftovers.

Twitter Email Most Popular Presented by All photos courtesy of Alex Tizon and his family My Family’s Slave Alex Tizon  She lived with us for 56 years. She raised me and my siblings without pay. I was 11, a typical American kid, before I realized who she was. The ashes filled a black plastic box about the size of a toaster. It weighed three and a half pounds. I put it in a canvas tote bag and packed it in my suitcase this past July for the transpacific flight to Manila. From there I would travel by car to a rural village. When I arrived, I would hand over all that was left of the woman who had spent 56 years as a slave in my family’s household. Continue Reading Lola Dupre When Your Child Is a Psychopath Barbara Bradley Hagerty The condition has long been considered untreatable. Experts can spot it in a child as young as 3 or 4. But a new clinical approach offers hope. This is a good day, Samantha tells me: 10 on a scale of 10. We’re sitting in a conference room at the San Marcos Treatment Center, just south of Austin, Texas, a space that has witnessed countless difficult conversations between troubled children, their worried parents, and clinical therapists. But today promises unalloyed joy. Samantha’s mother is visiting from Idaho, as she does every six weeks, which means lunch off campus and an excursion to Target. The girl needs supplies: new jeans, yoga pants, nail polish. Listen to the audio version of this article:Download the Audm app for your iPhone to listen to more titles. At 11, Samantha is just over 5 feet tall and has wavy black hair and a steady gaze. She flashes a smile when I ask about her favorite subject (history), and grimaces when I ask about her least favorite (math). She seems poised and cheerful, a normal preteen. But when we steer into uncomfortable territory—the events that led her to this juvenile-treatment facility nearly 2,000 miles from her family—Samantha hesitates and looks down at her hands. “I wanted the whole world to myself,” she says. “So I made a whole entire book about how to hurt people.” Continue Reading Shannon Stapleton / Reuters The Trump Organization Says It's 'Not Practical' to Comply With the Emoluments Clause Russell Berman The president’s business tells lawmakers it is too difficult to track all its foreign revenue in accordance with constitutional requirements, and it hasn’t asked Congress for a permission slip. Days before taking office, Donald Trump said his company would donate all profits from foreign governments to the U.S. Treasury, part of an effort to avoid even the appearance of a conflict with the Constitution’s emoluments clause. Now, however, the Trump Organization is telling Congress that determining exactly how much of its profits come from foreign governments is simply more trouble than it’s worth. In response to a document request from the House Oversight Committee, Trump’s company sent a copy of an eight-page pamphlet detailing how it plans to track payments it receives from foreign governments at the firm’s many hotels, golf courses, and restaurants across the globe. But while the Trump Organization said it would set aside all money it collects from customers that identify themselves as representing a foreign government, it would not undertake a more intensive effort to determine if a payment would violate the Constitution’s prohibition on public office holders accepting an “emolument” from a foreign state. Continue Reading Corbis Historical / Getty Why American Workers Now Dress So Casually Deirdre Clemente The office was, until a few decades ago, the last stronghold of fashion formality. Silicon Valley changed that. Americans began the 20th century in bustles and bowler hats and ended it in velour sweatsuits and flannel shirts—the most radical shift in dress standards in human history. At the center of this sartorial revolution was business casual, a genre of dress that broke the last bastion of formality—office attire—to redefine the American wardrobe. Born in Silicon Valley in the early 1980s, business casual consists of khaki pants, sensible shoes, and button-down collared shirts. By the time it was mainstream, in the 1990s, it flummoxed HR managers and employees alike. “Welcome to the confusing world of business casual,” declared a fashion writer for the Chicago Tribune in 1995. With time and some coaching, people caught on. Today, though, the term “business casual” is nearly obsolete for describing the clothing of a workforce that includes many who work from home in yoga pants, put on a clean T-shirt for a Skype meeting, and don’t always go into the office.

Marvel Comics has been having a rough time lately. Readers and critics met last year’s Civil War 2—a blockbuster crossover event (and a spiritual tie-in to the year’s big Marvel movie)—with disinterest and scorn. Two years of plummeting print comics sales culminated in a February during which only one series managed to sell over 50,000 copies. Three crossover events designed to pump up excitement came and went with little fanfare, while the lead-up to 2017’s blockbuster crossover Secret Empire—where a fascist Captain America subverts and conquers the United States—sparked such a negative response that the company later put out a statement imploring readers to buy the whole thing before judging it. On March 30, a battered Marvel decided to try and get to the bottom of the problem with a retailer summit—and promptly stuck its foot in its mouth.

For a number of reasons, natural and human, people have evacuated or otherwise abandoned many places around the world—large and small, old and new. Gathering images of deserted areas into a single photo essay, one can get a sense of what the world might look like if humans were to suddenly vanish from the planet. Collected here are recent scenes from abandoned construction projects, industrial disaster zones, blighted urban neighborhoods, towns where residents left to escape violence or natural disasters, derelict Olympic venues, ghost towns, and more.

Go down into the long tail of Grand Canyon videos, and you’ll eventually find a two-part, 35-minute lecture by Andrew Snelling. The first sign this isn’t a typical geology lecture comes about a minute in, when Snelling proclaims, “The Grand Canyon does provide a testament to the biblical account of Earth’s history.” Snelling is a prominent young-Earth creationist. For years, he has given lectures, guided biblical-themed Grand Canyon rafting tours, and worked for the nonprofit Answers in Genesis. (The CEO of Answers in Genesis, Ken Ham, is also behind the Creation Museum and the Ark Encounter theme park.) Young-Earth creationism, in contrast to other forms of creationism, specifically holds that the Earth is only thousands of years old. Snelling believes that the Grand Canyon formed after Noah’s flood—and he now claims the U.S. government is blocking his research in the canyon because of his religious views. Continue Reading AP/The Atlantic What ISIS Really Wants Graeme Wood The Islamic State is no mere collection of psychopaths. It is a religious group with carefully considered beliefs, among them that it is a key agent of the coming apocalypse. Here’s what that means for its strategy—and for how to stop it. What is the Islamic State? Where did it come from, and what are its intentions? The simplicity of these questions can be deceiving, and few Western leaders seem to know the answers. In December, The New York Times published confidential comments by Major General Michael K. Nagata, the Special Operations commander for the United States in the Middle East, admitting that he had hardly begun figuring out the Islamic State’s appeal. “We have not defeated the idea,” he said. “We do not even understand the idea.” In the past year, President Obama has referred to the Islamic State, variously, as “not Islamic” and as al-Qaeda’s “jayvee team,” statements that reflected confusion about the group, and may have contributed to significant strategic errors.

Inside ABC’s tonally bizarro update of the seminal 1987 romantic drama Dirty Dancing are about four different projects trying to get out. There’s the most obvious one, a frame-by-frame remake of the original that’s as awkward and ill-conceived as Gus Van Sant’s 1997 carbon copy of Psycho. There’s the one Abigail Breslin’s starring in, an emotionally textured and realistic coming-of-age story about a clumsy but engaging wallflower. There’s a musical, in which Breslin and Nicole Scherzinger mime along to their own singing voices in a strange dance rehearsal while half-heartedly exploring the idea that power emanates from the vagina. And there’s the most compelling story, a Wide Sargasso Sea-inspired spinoff starring Debra Messing as a lonely housewife coming to terms with the turbulent depths of her own desire.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) rumor mill today is news of AAPL testing new types of displays. Today, we’ll look at that and other Apple Rumors for Wednesday. Micro LED: A new rumor claims that Apple is ordering Micro LED displays for testing, reports AppleInsider. This rumor comes from an unnamed source in the company’s supply chain. The source says that the tech company made a small order for the Micro LED displays. They claim that the test company wants to evaluate the screens to see how well they will work with the company’s future products. 5G iPhone: Apple is already making plans to test out 5G technology, Business Insider notes. The tech company has filed an application to test the technology and it was made public by the FCC. The application will allow AAPL to test the 5G technology in an effort to prepare for its introduction by wireless carriers. This application states that the company will be testing the 5G tech out at two different locations. One of the locations will be at its original headquarters in on Mariani Avenue. The second testing ground will be in Milpitas, Calif., on Yosemite Drive. iPhone 8 Render: Yet another possible render for the iPhone 8 has shown up online,  reports 9to5Mac. The renders show a device that fits many of the rumors surrounding the device. This includes a display that takes up the majority of the front of the device. It also has the dual vertical camera on the rear the rumors have talked about. One thing to note is that this render has the fingerprint sensor on the back of the device. Rumors have been circulating about the placement of the fingerprint sensor on the iPhone 8, but it hasn’t been pinned down yet.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Apple is going all-in on OLED displays Chris Mills BGR News May 23, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share One of the big changes on the iPhone 8 that every rumor agrees on is the display. Apple will finally be making the jump from LCD to sharper and more battery-efficient OLED panels for its new flagship iPhone later this year, which makes total sense. But rumors also suggest that the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus, expected to be incremental upgrades unveiled in September, will stick with LCD. Since the iPhone 8 will likely cost upwards of $1,000, that means most iPhone users will still be stuck on LCD screens in 2017. Don't Miss: The Galaxy Note 8’s design may be just as exciting as the iPhone 8 A new report suggests that will all change by the time the iPhone 9 comes out. The Korea Herald‘s investment site is reporting that Apple has already signed a deal with Samsung to deliver 180 million OLED panels in 2018. The screens have been ordered in two sizes, which hints heavily that Apple will return to its usual release cycle in 2018: two new iPhones with very similar features, but one with a regular screen and one bigger Plus version. The timing of the report makes sense, as it’s about 18 months before Apple could be expected to launch the next-next iPhone. Signing a deal this far in advance gives Samsung time to overhaul its factories and buy new tooling, necessary to start work on an assembly line, design production prototypes, and finally start making screens months before launch. However, other details like the type of glass used in the display (and possibly an under-screen fingerprint sensor) wouldn’t have to be worked out for some time, so this doesn’t mean that the design of the iPhone 9 is remotely finalized yet. The choice of manufacturing partner also makes sense. Samsung is rumored to be the OLED supplier for the iPhone 8, with a contract for 70 million displays reportedly signed months ago. Even though Samsung and Apple’s consumer electronics arms are forever locked in fierce competition, Apple has leaned heavily on Samsung’s heavier manufacturing arms as a key component supplier in the past.

Generate Enquiries for your Business by Listing on Economictimes.com List Your Business Find Service Near You NEW DELHI: Google, Apple and Samsung, besides being big on smartphones, have another product in common and relevant for India: payments. Google’s latest launch – a payment API – underlines the growing importance of smartphones as the primary platform for digital transactions, one that ties in well with India’s move to a less-cash economy. Last week, Google announced its payment API (application programming interphase), which opens up all smartphones based on its Android operating system to online payments, allowing in-app or online purchases using debit or credit cards linked to one’s Google account. While Samsung introduced Samsung Pay in March and Apple plans to launch its Apple Pay in India, both are specific to their respective devices. These add to mobile wallets operated by Paytm and MobiKwik, besides those by telcos Bharti Airtel, Vodafone and Idea Cellular, which are also trying to tap the growing use of digital payments. “Solutions like Google Payments API or even Android Pay can be important for bringing users on board for making cashless payments and may even help in generating critical mass in countries like India, given Google’s reach,” said Tarun Pathak, associate director at Counterpoint Technology Market Research. According to Sanjay Razdan, director of Samsung Pay Business, smartphones meet four key requirements for online payments – seamless experience, infrastructure, security and most importantly, behaviour change – from cash to non-cash. These points “have been further helped by large-scale data connectivity by Reliance Jio and free data at their disposal,” he said, talking about the increasing use of the devices for payments in the country. He said the key barriers remain the basic nature of Indians to transact in cash and the security of financial transactions. The slowing conversion from feature phones to smartphones is achallenge as well. Still, transactions on smartphones have risen through mobile wallets, unified payment interface (UPI) and payment mechanisms including Samsung Pay. The number of daily transactions on mobile wallets doubled to 44.3 lakh within six months of the November 8 demonetisation, according to data as of May 17 from the ministry of IT and electronics. UPI payments surged to 3.31 lakh from 3,721in this time. Debit card payments almost quadrupled and Aadhaar-enabled payments rose almost five-fold, while immediate payment systems or IMPS increased 52%. “Percentage of people using smartphoneshas grown from 21.2% in 2014 to 33.4% in 2017, which is further expected to grow to 39% by 2019, thereby bridging the gap year-on-year,” said Bipin Preet Singh, founder of mobile wallet MobiKwik, which, along with its peers, saw transactions doubling since demonetisation. Samsung is in talks with Indian banks to issue virtual cards to consumers’ smartphones rather than physical ones to save costs and put to use the ubiquity of the devices, which is growing every year, for digital transactions, Razdan said. Analysts at Deloitte India predict mobile and digital payments will overtake physical card payments as the predominant non-cash payment mode within this year.

The documentation is now available for download from Apple’s iBook store, for free. The course will guide students on how to build fully functional apps over the course of the year. In the announcement, Tim Cook, said: We’ve seen firsthand the impact that coding has on individuals and the US economy as a whole. The app economy and software development are among the fastest-growing job sectors in America and we’re thrilled to be providing educators and students with the tools to learn coding. Community colleges play a critical role in helping students achieve their dreams, and we hope these courses will open doors for people of all ages and backgrounds to pursue what they love. The new curriculum will be taught in six community college systems which cater for half a million students across the US. The course will be taught starting in the upcoming academic year. Local businesses will also offer students from different campuses mentoring and internships. The colleges included in the list of those delivering the curriculum include Alabama Community College System, Columbus State Community College, Harrisburg Area Community College, Houston Community College, Mesa Community College, and San Mateo Community College District. Some high schools across the country will also deliver the curriculum.

Apple's flagship smartphone isn't expected for at least another four months but the clip shows a dummy version based on leaked schematics.   The ten second preview video and schematics show some of the expected features of the final iPhone 8 design. Scroll down for video  Apple's flagship smartphone isn't expected for at least another four months but a ten second clip shows a dummy version (pictured) based on leaked schematics. Designer Benjamin Geskin, based in Riga, Latvia, uploaded the sneak preview to YouTube yesterday Designer Benjamin Geskin, based in Riga, Latvia, uploaded the video to YouTube yesterday. He says that the clip shows a dummy display model of the handset created in Chin, based on the schematics. It also contains a number of expected features for the iPhone 8. The sleek black phone is extremely thin and the glass screen area appears to reach to each corner and edge of the front of the phone, in line with rumours of a bezel-less design.

Share this article Share 27 shares The Touch ID button is notably absent from both the front and rear of the display model, following speculation that Apple has worked out a way to embed the technology into the device's screen The rear features a silver oval area which could house the dual-lens 3D camera thought to be a new headline feature of the iPhone 8. The tipster also Tweeted a copy of the schematics, writing a short message on Twitter in which he said: 'Alleged #iPhone8 schematics.' As with the iPhone 7, the schematics seem to show that the iPhone 8 will also not include a headphone socket. Video courtesy of iVenyaWay The eagerly anticipated 10th anniversary edition of iPhone, rumoured to be called Edition, is expected in September. But recent rumours have cast doubt on this time frame. An analyst from Deutsche Bank has released a research note that stated the Cupertino company will not launch its 10th anniversary smartphone in 2017.  The note has pointed at 'key component shortages and technical challenges' as the culprits behind a major delay. The note, which was first reported on by Business Insider, surfaced earlier this month based on a report from ValueWalk. The tipster also Tweeted a copy of the leaked schematics (pictured). The drawings and video show a number of expected features for the iPhone 8 The glass screen area appears to reach to each corner and edge of the front of the phone (left), in line with rumours of a bezel-less design. The rear (right) features a silver oval area which could house the dual-lens 3D camera thought to be a new headline feature IPHONE 8 RUMORS   Several rumors have been circulating about the iPhone 8, and suggest the next device may have:  - Dual-lens 3D camera  - Augmented reality to generate real-time views of surroundings  - Curved glass casing - Plastic OLED screen  - Wireless charging  - A folding element  - New 5 inch (12.7 centimeter) and 5.8 inch (14.7 centimeter) model, which will have a wraparound OLED screen  - 5.8 inch will be designed with the Touch ID finger print sensor 'under the glass and in the active display area'  - A new 'pure white' model  - Aluminum back will be replaced with two reinforced glass panes and a metal frame in the middle  - Facial recognition -Premium model will cost $1,000  'Report suggests no new iPhone 8 this calendar year,' the analysts wrote. 'As we have written in previous [research notes], several supply chain reports have suggested that key component shortages and technical challenges could delay the release of a high-end iPhone 8 device this fall.' 'We believe this report further underscores the uncertainty around the timing of Apple's next- generation iPhone model.'   ValueWalk released insider information it had received from anonymous supply chain sources 'within the critical Foxconn corporation' that packaging materials for the iPhone 8 are not expected to arrive until June – leaving Apple little time to ramp up productions and release a cutting-edge device. However, the sources also revealed that this timeline will allow Apple to release the iPhone 7s line in September. Although sources noted this will send many iOS users into a frenzy, the assured that the tech giant will still 'do something outstanding' in honor of the iPhone's 10-year anniversary. Prior to the disheartening news, the majority of rumours had suggested that the iPhone 8 would simply be late and not cancelled. The eagerly anticipated 10th anniversary edition of iPhone, rumoured to be called Edition, is expected in September. The sleek black dummy phone (pictured) is extremely thin Recent rumours have cast doubt on the anticipated release time frame, potentially delaying it until next year. As with the iPhone 7, the schematics and video seem to show that the iPhone 8 (pictured) will also not include a headphone socket Earlier this month, the Economic Daily News (via Digitimes) had published a report that iOS users would have to wait until October or November to get their new iPhone 8. The delay, much like Deutsche Bank's reason' was said to be caused by technical issues, as suppliers have struggled with the lamination process of the curved OLED panels and adoption of the 3D sensing front-camera technology.    'Technical issues related to the lamination process of curved OLED panels, and the adoption of a 3D sensing system may cause the delay of the new iPhone devices,' said the paper. However, Apple has experienced manufacturing issues in the past, so has many other phone makers, but 9to5Mac has shared supporting evidence that suggests this time might be the real deal. A report from March revealed that the Cupertino firm would not start mass production of the so-called iPhone 8 until September.  TIMELINE: TEN YEARS OF IPHONES  2007:  After being unveiled in January, the first iPhone goes on sale amid passionate Apple fan reaction and queues outside retail stores. 2008: On July 11 2008 the second generation iPhone 3G launches, including in a white colour option for the first time.  2009: The iPhone 3GS goes on sale in June, and sales for the year reach more than 25 million. 2010: The introduction of the iPhone 4 includes the first major redesign of the iPhone.

Play it now! more GADGET REVIEWS Is this the ultimate party speaker? MailOnline puts Sony's XB40 to the test Sony SRS-XB40 has a built-in multi-coloured line light, speaker lights and a flashing strobe. It features 24 hours of battery life and claims to be a 'mini-disco on the move'. But does it live up to the claim? Samsung's Galaxy S8: A hefty price tag and a dumb personal assistant Samsung's new Galaxy S8 phone is stunning, but its $100 price hike is hard to swallow. Overall the S8 is for those who want elegance - and are willing to pay for it. Affordable, robust and surprisingly responsive: Samsung's Galaxy A5 With the eagerly awaited Galaxy S8 having been pushed back, South Korea-based Samsung has plugged the gap with the Samsung Galaxy A5, a high-end device with a mid-range price tag. Is it really worth paying £280 for Nintendo's Switch? MailOnline's verdict While the design is impressive and easy to use, the game line up is disappointing. Google's Daydream: The $79 headset that could bring VR to the masses Google's $79 headset is superb in terms of hardware - but is currently let down by a lack of apps. However, it has absolutely huge potential to finally bring VR to the masses. Welcome Home: Google's $130 smart speaker Google's smart Home speaker still has a lot of learning to do, and loses out to Amazon's Echo in some areas - but has incredible potential 'Not quite an iPhone replacement': Google's Pixel phone Google's Pixel handset is good, and boasts an amazing camera and smart assistant. It's the king of the Android handsets - but still not great. Xbox One S review: Console that will make your 4K TV shine Microsoft's Xbox One S has shrunk the giant console by 40%, and is stunningly designed console with 4K HDR capabilities - but comes with some caveats. The $1,000 wireless speaker that really IS worth the price: Naim Mu-so Qb review Naim's incredible Mu-So Qb takes you back to the good old days - where the music captivates and enthralls, rather that simply being something in the background. The hi-tech $2,000 spin bike that really could change your life Peloton's hi-tech bike lets you stream live and on demand rides to your home - and it's one of the best examples of fitness technology out there - at a price. Apple's new 9.7inch iPad Pro is a powerhouse you can take anywhere Apple has added a few improvements to the smaller version, creating a tablet that is astonishingly powerful, but, unlike its big brother, is something you'll be able to carry everywhere. Speaker that looks as good as its sounds: B&W Zeppelin Wireless review It's not cheap, but the $699 (£500) Zeppelin Wireless is perfect for the design conscious music fan.

One set of photos shows a bezel-less screen display and a Touch ID sensor on the back of the iPhone beneath the Apple logo. The images also show a vertically aligned dual-camera system on the back of the device. The vertical alignment, which differs from the iPhone 7 Plus’ horizontal position, had been previously rumored. Read: iPhone 2017 Final Designs Leak? iPhone 8 Molds Show Vertical Camera System, Sizes The photo also shows a lack of glass on the back of the device. Previous rumors pointed to an iPhone 8 with a glass back for wireless charging. The photos show the device in five colors, including white, which hasn’t been sold since 2011. The images also show silver, gold, matte black and jet black versions. Meanwhile, a render seems to contradict the other images. The photo shows no Touch ID on the back of the iPhone 8. Both sets of images show no rose gold iPhone 8 version, which suggests Apple could discontinue the color. Embedded Touch ID On iPhone 8? Previous reports have said Apple’s 10th-anniversary phone, which could also be called the iPhone X, iPhone Pro or iPhone Edition, will come with an edge-to-edge OLED screen display with an embedded Touch ID. Apple recently was granted a patent for an edge-to-edge display and another patent for a Touch ID embedded in the display screen. Read: iPhone 8 Price, Rumors: Goldman Sachs Predicts New iPhone Will Cost $1K, Have 3D Sensing, No Home Button This week, leaked photos of alleged iPhone 8 molds suggested the 10th-anniversary phone will not come with a Touch ID on the back of the device. However, a schematic of the iPhone 8 leaked last month by Sonny Dickson shows a circular hole underneath the Apple logo, which points to a possible Touch ID placement on the back of the device, similar to how it is placed on Samsung’s Galaxy S8. An analyst from Cowen and Co. previously said the embedded Touch ID feature was the one with which  Apple was having the most trouble. He gave three solutions in case Apple can’t fix issues with the feature: Ditch the Touch ID and rely on facial recognition instead or move it to the back of the device although it wouldn’t be user friendly, the analyst pointed out. The final solution would be to delay production of the iPhone 8 but still announce the device this fall alongside the iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus. The iPhone 8 is expected to be released in September and is rumored to cost more than $1,000. Previous reports have indicated the iPhone 8 will come with a 3D-sensing front camera and wireless charging.

Interested in learning how to code and develop apps? Apple on Wednesday released a free app development curriculum designed for high school and community college students. The full-year curriculum, available as a free download in Apple's iBooks Store, was designed by Apple engineers and educators to teach students how to design apps using the iPhone maker's Swift programming language. A number of popular apps like Airbnb, Kayak, TripAdvisor, Venmo, and Yelp were created with Swift. Students who complete the curriculum will gain "critical job skills in software development and information technology," Apple said. Six community college systems and select high schools across the US will be among the first to offer the curriculum, starting this fall. They includes the Alabama Community College System, Columbus State Community College, Harrisburg Area Community College, Houston Community College, Mesa Community College and San Mateo Community College District. Local businesses at many of the participating campuses will also offer students mentoring and internships, Apple said. Related The Best Programs to Learn to Code of 2016 The Best Programs to Learn to Code of 2016 In a statement, Apple CEO Tim Cook said "the app economy and software development are among the fastest-growing job sectors in America. "We've seen firsthand the impact that coding has on individuals and the US economy as a whole," he said. "We hope these courses will open doors for people of all ages and backgrounds to pursue what they love." The new curriculum comes after Apple earlier this month pledged $1 billion to boost "advanced manufacturing" in the US.

Here’s what we know so far. The tests will happen at two locations: Milpitas, California on Yosemite Drive and Mariani Avenue next to Apple’s 1 Infinite Loop headquarters. The application for the license, which was made public by the FCC, says: Apple Inc. seeks to assess cellular link performance in direct path and multipath environments between base station transmitters and receivers using this spectrum…These assessments will provide engineering data relevant to the operation of devices on wireless carriers’ future 5G networks. Apple intends to transmit from two fixed points located at Apple-controlled facilities in Cupertino and Milpitas, CA. These transmissions will be consistent with the parameters and equipment identified in Apple’s accompanying Form 442, and will include the use of a horn antenna with a half-power beamwidth of 20 degrees in the E-plane and H-plane and a downtilt between 20 – 25 degrees. Apple anticipates that it will conduct its experiments for a period not to exceed 12 months. Millimeter Wave Technology One of the promises of 5G is that speeds will be faster than current wireless technology. And what that really means is that (Apple) music streaming and Netflix binging will be easier. Millimeter wave means that the radio waves are at a higher frequency than today’s 4G LTE standards. On the electromagnetic spectrum, millimeter waves are between 30 and 300 gigahertz (GHz). Apple wants to test the 28 and 39 GHz bands. Currently, radar, satellite and certain military systems use this area of the spectrum. Apple Satellite That might mean Apple’s tests have less to do with iPhone, and more to do with Apple Maps. Another possibility is satellite internet. Last month The Mac Observer reported that Boeing is working on a plan for 1,000 satellites to provide internet access for customers, and Apple was invited to participate. At the same time, shorter wavelengths can’t travel as far as longer wavelengths. We’re talking hundreds of meters instead of kilometers. And millimeter waves can’t penetrate walls and other obstacles easily. If the transmitter and receiver aren’t in a direct line of site, there is signal loss. Internet from spaaaace! Workarounds could include smaller cell towers, called microcells, femtocells and picocells (depending on range). Antenna size is inversely proportional to frequency size, which means that 5G millimeter waves can use smaller antennas and use the spectrum more efficiently. In any case, Apple is certainly paying attention to future technologies. We probably won’t see ubiquitous 5G Wi-Fi until the early 2020s, although some estimates are more optimistic than others. In the meantime, we’ll have to be content with 4G LTE.

The film was debuted at the Tribecka Film Festival earlier this year, and Apple Music subsequently bought the rights to it. The focus of the film is a reunion show with The Bad Boy Family, the original group of artists that launched with Bad Boy Records. According to the Tribecka Festivail, “the film also looks back to trace the label’s emergence in Harlem and Brooklyn, it’s meteoric rise, the tragic killing of Biggie Smalls, and the lasting influence on music, fashion, marketing and culture.” Note Apple executive Jimmy Iovine’s brief appearance in the trailer.

The curriculum is part of Apple’s Everyone Can Code series, and will be available for free on the iBooks Store Wednesday. It’ll also be taught in several community colleges and high schools in the United States this fall. Apple brings new Swift training tools to iBooks Store, schools Swift is an Apple-developed coding language for macOS, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS. The Swift coding environment is available for free, as are the related training and educational materials. Apple says six community colleges will offer its Swift curriculum this fall, and local businesses have committed to offer students mentoring and internships. “We’ve seen firsthand the impact that coding has on individuals and the US economy as a whole,” said Apple CEO Tim Cook. “The app economy and software development are among the fastest-growing job sectors in America and we’re thrilled to be providing educators and students with the tools to learn coding.” Teaming up with schools to teach Swift, as well as offering free training materials to everyone is a smart move for Apple. The more people who are exposed to the language, the larger the pool of potential developers becomes. That (hopefully) translates into a wider range of compelling apps for the Mac, iPhone and iPad, abd ultimately into more customers. Apple’s new Swift curriculum will be available for download today, and maybe at a school near you this fall.

Forget the iPhone 8: micro-LED screens could power Apple’s future Yoni Heisler @edibleapple May 24th, 2017 at 3:30 PM Share Tweet It’s no secret that Apple in recent years has started devoting more and more R&D resources towards researching next-gen display technologies. In 2015, for example, Apple opened up a semi-secretive research lab in Taiwan where a team of 50+ engineers and scientists are tasked with exploring advanced display technologies that would allow Apple to release products with thinner, lighter, and of course, more energy efficient displays. Don't Miss: Don’t let that ugly iPhone 8 model scare you – this is what the real thing will look like Looking ahead, it’s widely believed that Apple’s upcoming iPhone 8 will be the first iPhone model to incorporate an OLED display. Still, it shouldn’t come as much of a surprise that Apple is already looking beyond OLED towards the next big thing. To that end, a new report from Digitimes relays that Apple recently ordered a batch of Micro LED screens for testing in future products. According to the report, Apple may begin trial production on devices with Micro LED displays as soon as this year, though it’s possible trial production might be pushed back to 2018. “Apple has been keen in the development of micro LED technology following its acquisition of LuxVue in 2014,” the report reads, “and recent market speculations also indicate that Apple is likely to crank out a small volume of micro LED display products from its plant in Taoyuan, northern Taiwan at the end of the year.” As for why Apple is interested in micro LED technology, the displays are said to be significantly brighter and far more energy efficient than current OLED display technology. And as smartphones seemingly take on heavier tasks with each passing year, the need for displays that consume less power becomes more and more of a strategic advantage. Interestingly enough, Kleiner Perkins partner John Doerr, while speaking about the Micro LED technology Apple picked up when it acquired LuxVue, intimated a few years ago that the technology represents a “technical breakthrough in displays.” As it stands now, there are challenges associated with building large Micro LED displays, which is to say you shouldn’t expect it to be a feature on Apple’s line of MacBooks anytime soon. As for the iPhone, well, Samsung and Apple reportedly have a deal for OLED displays that runs through the iPhone 9, so we may have to wait a bit before Micro LED displays on smartphones becomes a reality as well.

The iPhone 9 reportedly will come in two OLED models, a 5.28-inch version and a 6.46-inch device. Read: iPhone 8 Price, Rumors: Goldman Sachs Predicts New iPhone Will Cost $1K, Have 3D Sensing, No Home Button Samsung and Apple's new deal for 2018 iPhones comes after the companies recently signed a deal for the supply of 70 million OLED panels for the 10th anniversary iPhone this year, it was reported last month. Apple reportedly signed a two-year deal worth $9 billion with Samsung for the OLED panels in April. Tuesday’s report said Samsung’s OLED shipment will double at 180 million units for next year's iPhone lineup.  “The two companies have recently signed a nondisclosure agreement on general conditions, including the screen size,” sources told the Bell. “Other details such as screen design and functions could be adjusted considering the phone is still under development.” It was also reported Samsung is leveling the ground at its industrial complex in Asan, South Korea, to build OLED production facilities dedicated to iPhones. Read: iPhone 8 Release Date: Apple Could Launch Device In October, According To Supply Chain Reports iPhone 8 Rumors, Price, Release Date Before the iPhone 9 is released next year, Apple is expected to reveal three new iPhones this year, the iPhone 7S, iPhone 7S Plus and the iPhone 8. The iPhone 8, which could also be called the iPhone X, iPhone Pro or iPhone Edition, is expected to come with an edge-to-edge OLED display screen. The smartphone is rumored to come with wireless charging feature and an enhanced Siri. Apple  reportedly plans to boost its virtual assistant with contextual learning abilities and deep integration with iMessage and iCloud. The Siri update is expected in the upcoming iOS 11 update in September, but Apple could show a glimpse of the technology at the Worldwide Developers Conference next month. The iPhone 8 also reportedly will feature an embedded Touch ID on the screen display. However, a report last month said the embedded Touch ID feature was the one causing Apple the most trouble. Apple’s newest iPhone is also rumored to come with a vertical dual-camera system, deviating from the horizontal positioning seen on the iPhone 7 Plus, and a 3D-sensing front camera. The iPhone 8 is expected to be released in September; however, some reports have said the release date for the 10th-anniversary smartphone could be delayed because of key components for the rumored 3D-sensing camera. Other rumors suggest the device’s release date could be pushed back until late October or November because of trouble with Apple’s OLED display order. Meanwhile, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chu Kuo said the 10th anniversary iPhone could face "severe supply shortages" when it releases. Goldman Sachs recently predicted the iPhone 8 could cost more than $1,000. Related Articles iPhone 8 Touch ID Sensor Situated Below Apple Logo?

With a lack of part leaks, we're relying on dummy units, design drawings, and design renders to give us an idea of what to expect from the device, and there's been no shortage of those leaks, many of which are somewhat confusing due to the fact that Apple tested several iPhone 8 prototypes. This week, the first hands-on video featuring an alleged iPhone 8 dummy model surfaced. We already saw the dummy model in question in photographs back in April, but the video provides a better look at the device, and perhaps a better picture of what the iPhone 8 might look like if accurate. This particular dummy device, said to be a CNC model, aligns with design drawings and rumors pointing towards an edge-to-edge display with a glass body encased in a shiny stainless steel frame. There is no Home button and no visible Touch ID sensor, suggesting it is built into the display, which would be in line with many rumors. It features a dual-lens rear camera in a vertical orientation and it lacks an Apple logo, so it's not entirely clear if this is representative of the final design Apple settled on, but it does match up with a lot of the rumors we've heard. Alleged iPhone 8 design drawings and schematics that resemble this dummy suggest the iPhone will be thicker than the current iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. The dummy device in the video above represents one set of design drawings we've seen, but there's also a second set of design images that have circulated featuring an iPhone with an aluminum body and a rear Touch ID button underneath the Apple logo. The device with a rear Touch ID button is said to be one of the prototypes Apple tested as a fallback should an under-display Touch ID solution not pan out. Rumors and leaks seem to be coalescing around the first iPhone 8 design without a rear Touch ID sensor, suggesting the images with the back Touch ID button are based on an outdated design that was perhaps scrapped. That it appears unlikely this design will be used in the iPhone 8 hasn't stopped one China-based company from creating an iPhone 8 clone based on the schematics and design drawings that have been circulating. Leaker Benjamin Geskin this morning shared images of what he says is an iPhone 8 clone that was designed based on an early iPhone 8 prototype model. It features a front display with slim bezels, a vertical camera, an aluminum body in multiple colors, and a rear Touch ID sensor. As a clone, this is not representative of what the real iPhone 8 will look like, but it provides an interesting glimpse at prototype design and what an iPhone with a rear Touch ID sensor might resemble. With multiple prototypes in testing, the actual design of the iPhone 8 will remain unconfirmed and up in the air until we start to see legitimate part leaks. In past years, part leaks have started earlier than May, and their absence may suggest that Apple still has not settled on a finalized design. For a complete overview of the iPhone 8 rumors and a better picture of what we expect to see included in the overhauled device, make sure to check out our iPhone 8 roundup. It goes into much greater detail on the different design prototypes and it includes information on all of the internal features we expect, like advanced biometrics (facial or iris recognition), an A11 processor, wireless charging, a new front-facing camera system, and more.

Touch ID on the back, home button gone... I know many on here have lost faith in Apple, but I haven't. There are almost no sensible decisions that lead to such a design choice, but exactly these design choices are (some say were) at Apple's core.

Rating: 8 Votes TimUSCA 12 hours ago at 12:23 pm I'm still not buying Touch ID on the back. It's just not ergonomic, and it doesn't seem like something Apple would do. Obviously I could be wrong, but I don't think I am. How would that even work as a home button? Pushing against the back with your index just wouldn't work. The thumb works because you're pushing the phone against your palm.

THEY NEED TO DELAY THE LAUNCH TILL THEY GET TOUCH ID UNDER THE SCREEN. PLEASE. More or less my thinking. Fingerprint sensor on back = fail. If that ends up being the case, I will wait for the 8S when they've figured out how to put it on the front. Bezelless isn't worth touchID on the back. I don't care about bezelless that much.

By Tiernan Ray May 24, 2017 2:19 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Cowen & Co.’s Timothy Arcuri today reiterates an Outperform rating on shares of Apple (AAPL), and a $160 price target, after concluding Apple’s shipments of iPhone may yet be delayed by production issues — problems making the next iPhone’s “AMOLED” screen — though it’s not entirely clear it even matters for the company and its stock. “Unless AAPL drops OLED into CQ3 or otherwise revises this 44MM supply number up, this could actually put Street numbers at risk for CQ3,” writes Arcuri, referring to the three months ending in September. It’s widely expected Apple will unveil a new, more-expensive model of iPhone around the September time frame, as it traditionally has. The “OLED” here refers to an expected model of the “iPhone 8,” or iPhone “X,” or whatever it ends up being called, that will presumably use AMOLED display glass technology, the first time Apple has used the higher-resolution AMOLED technology in a phone. Arcuri write that whereas the Street is modeling 47 million to 48 million units for the September quarter, Apple may not have the more-desirable OLED models till after September, thus causing it to ship fewer devices in Q3. "Our first look at CQ3 iPhone supply suggests ~44MM with no OLED units,” he writes. "This 5.8-inch OLED version is, of course, still targeting an edge-to-edge bezel-free design,” he writes, "but the integration of Touch ID into the display remains challenging and there are still multiple possible outcomes." "The goal continues to be finalizing fingerprint sensor spec by end of May, but mass assembly schedule of this OLED version might be delayed to late Oct/early Nov vs. the normal late July/August timeframe." Another potential problem, he writes, is that the “low yield rate (less than 60%) for the new 'substrate like’ PCB might be another challenge contributing to the delayed product launch." However, after all that Arcuri concedes “this may not matter for the stock if we are right about CQ4 iPhone units of ~90MM." “But it is what it is at this point." Apple stock today is down 44 cents at $153.36.

Editorial Director at Mobile Nations, analyst at iMore, video and podcast host, you can follow him @reneritchie on Snapchat, Instagram, and Twitter. Launch iBooks, download the full year curriculum, and start your journey into coding apps. Apple has just launched a new app development curriculum, available on the company's iBooks e-reader app, that aims to let anyone in high school or community college learn to code in Swift and create apps for iPhone and iPad. "We've seen firsthand the impact that coding has on individuals and the US economy as a whole. The app economy and software development are among the fastest-growing job sectors in America and we're thrilled to be providing educators and students with the tools to learn coding," said Tim Cook, Apple's CEO. "Community colleges play a critical role in helping students achieve their dreams, and we hope these courses will open doors for people of all ages and backgrounds to pursue what they love." Last year, Apple introduced Swift Playgrounds at WWDC 2016 as a way to get children, and children of all ages, familiar with the basic concepts of code. The app developer curriculum takes that not just a step further but a leap all the way to secondary and post-secondary education. Several community colleges have simultaneously announced support for the new curriculum, including the Alabama Community College System, Columbus State Community College, Harrisburg Area Community College, Houston Community College, Mesa Community College, and San Mateo Community College District, with more colleges and high schools on the way. "We are focused on preparing our students for life in a global and technological society, and in 2017 that means making sure our students have access to a state-of-the-art coding curriculum," said Houston Community College Chancellor Cesar Maldonado. "We are thrilled Apple is offering this incredible opportunity to advance student learning, which will especially help us bridge the gap in computer science training for minorities and women. We can't wait to see what these students will do and already have local businesses offering mentoring and internship opportunities." The program was put together using the same approach as Swift Playgrounds, with everyone from educators to software engineers sharing ideas to create the best, most teachable, most learnable curriculum possible. And since it's available on iBooks, it's available to anyone with an iPhone, iPad, or Mac, anywhere they want to open it. Education has always been central to Apple, with iBooks and Apple Education (originally iTunes U) initially intended to help revolutionize the textbook industry by making curriculums easier to deploy and update. Swift was also designed to be taught in schools starting at a young age, something that had been sorely missing from the previous generation of popular app development languages. Having Swift in the classroom isn't just good for students, of course. It's good for Apple and iPhone and iPad customers eagerly awaiting the next great wave of apps. Press release below. Apple launches app development curriculum for high school and community college students Innovative Full-Year Curriculum Now Available on the iBooks Store Students will be able to learn to code and develop apps at high schools and community colleges across the country. Houston — Apple today launched a new app development curriculum designed for students who want to pursue careers in the fast-growing app economy. The curriculum is available as a free download today from Apple's iBooks Store. App Development with Swift is a full-year course designed by Apple engineers and educators to teach students elements of app design using Swift, one of the world's most popular programming languages. Students will learn to code and design fully functional apps, gaining critical job skills in software development and information technology. Students who want to learn about app development can download the curriculum for free from the iBooks Store. Starting this fall, six community college systems serving nearly 500,000 students across the country will be among the first to offer the innovative curriculum. At many campuses, local businesses will also offer students mentoring and internships. "We've seen firsthand the impact that coding has on individuals and the US economy as a whole. The app economy and software development are among the fastest-growing job sectors in America and we're thrilled to be providing educators and students with the tools to learn coding," said Tim Cook, Apple's CEO. "Community colleges play a critical role in helping students achieve their dreams, and we hope these courses will open doors for people of all ages and backgrounds to pursue what they love." The course uses Swift, Apple's popular and easy-to-use programming language. The curriculum will be offered by the Alabama Community College System, Columbus State Community College, Harrisburg Area Community College, Houston Community College, Mesa Community College and San Mateo Community College District, among others. Select high schools across the country will also be teaching the App Development with Swift curriculum starting this fall. Houston Community College is opening an iOS Coding and Design School that will teach Apple's new curriculum. "The world calls Houston a knowledge capital because of the incredible concentration of ideas and innovation in our great city," said Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner. "Apple's investment in our community with the launch of the app development curriculum will tap into the creativity of our students, inspire new possibilities and foster our culture of technological transformation." "We are focused on preparing our students for life in a global and technological society, and in 2017 that means making sure our students have access to a state-of-the-art coding curriculum," said Houston Community College Chancellor Cesar Maldonado. "We are thrilled Apple is offering this incredible opportunity to advance student learning, which will especially help us bridge the gap in computer science training for minorities and women. We can't wait to see what these students will do and already have local businesses offering mentoring and internship opportunities." Apple's curriculum includes a comprehensive student guide with playground exercises, mini projects and quizzes, as well as a teachers guide with grading rubrics, solutions code and Keynote presentations. App Development with Swift is an extension of Apple's existing K-12 Everyone Can Code curricula which offer everyone the power to learn, write and teach coding. Swift is Apple's powerful and intuitive programming language that gives developers the freedom and capabilities they need to create the next generation of cutting-edge software. Popular apps including Airbnb, KAYAK, TripAdvisor, Venmo and Yelp are all created with Swift. In addition to over 1 million downloads of Swift Playgrounds, there have been over 430,000 downloads of the additional Everyone Can Code materials and over 1,000 schools across the US plan to teach with Everyone Can Code materials in the fall. Earlier this month, Apple announced the creation of the Advanced Manufacturing Fund focused on creating jobs in the US throughout our supply chain, with an initial investment of $1 billion. The new Swift coding curriculum is another example of Apple's commitment to economic development and will help create even more career opportunities for students across the country. Apple now supports 2 million jobs across all 50 states, including more than 1.5 million jobs attributable to Apple's app economy.

In fact, I would like to script in Swift on iOS, with a light version that would be secure. Maybe a swiftKIT (with a ninja icon!) API. You can use the IBM Swift Sandbox: https://swift.sandbox.bluemix.net/#/repl So you can actually learn to code Swift on iOS, beyond Swift Playgrounds, just not make actual apps. 0 10 hours ago Reply Menu Log in or Sign up Search Apple Apps & Games Accessories & Toys Photo & Video Health & Fitness Movies & Music Transport Security Rumors Analysis How To The Best Reviews Deals Newsletter Forums Podcasts Android Central WindowsCentral iMore CrackBerry Connectedly TeslaCentral VRHeads MrMobile Modern Dad About Contact Us Jobs Privacy & Terms Mobile Nations 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2017 Mobile Nations Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Careers: Writer | Dev Licensing External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner

If you're a "daywalker" and use both Android and iOS, you probably wish your Android phone and iPad could play as nicely as an iPhone and iPad. Well, they can't. And here's what Apple thinks whenever you wish for it in your heart: They might work together one day, but for now, Apple has its ecosystem on lockdown, and only Apple products can talk to other Apple products. That being said, there are still a few ways you can at least keep your data in sync between Android and iPad. Google apps Dropbox OneDrive Google apps All you need is a Google account (Gmail) and you immediately get free access to Google's apps: Docs, Sheets, Keep, Photos, Drive, Calendar, and more. Google Drive is where you can upload all of your data — files, photos, music — whatever you want. You get 15GB of free storage, as well as unlimited photo storage (well, it's a petabyte, but I defy you to fill up 1,000TB). You'll already need to use a Google account with your Android phone anyway, and most Android phones come with all the Google apps pre-installed, so Google is definitely your best option for keeping your data synced between your Android phone and iPad. Learn more Dropbox When you think of cloud storage, one of the first names that pops up is probably Dropbox. Dropbox lets you create folders and share them with friends and family. It's a secure place to store your photos, files, music, and other data. You get 2GB of free storage space, and after that it's $99 per year or $9.99 a month for 1TB of storage (Dropbox Plus). Learn more OneDrive Do you have an Android phone, an iPad, and a PC? Then OneDrive might be best for you, since you'll be able to keep your data synced across all of your devices. OneDrive is Microsoft's cloud storage service, which gives you 5GB of free storage. If you have Microsoft Office, you can collaborate on documents in Word, Excel, and Powerpoint, much like iCloud and the iWork apps. If you need more storage, it's $1.99/month for 50GB, or you can jump to Premium, which is $69.99 a year and includes the Office suite and 1TB of storage. If you walk in all worlds when it comes to your tech, then OneDrive may be your best option for making everything play together nicely. Learn more Any other tips?

There's the free account (with 15GB of storage) but to my knowledge, this does not include the free G Suite or 1PB of photo storage. Can you clarify? 0 6 hours ago Reply Mike Tanasychuk I had incorrectly referred to Google's free apps as G Suite. While G Suite does encompass those apps, it is another service available to business and school, and it does cost money. That being said, when you sign up for a Google account, you automatically get 15GB of free storage with Google Drive, and you get "unlimited" (1PB) photo storage with Photos, so long as those photos are 16MP or less (storage is less otherwise). 0 6 hours ago Reply n8ter#AC In this situation, I'd simply replace the iPad with a Windows or Google Play Tablet. 0 1 hour ago Reply wshwe I have a Samsung Galaxy S7 and LTE iPad Air 2.

The processor company said today that it will make it much easier – particularly more affordable – for third-party hardware companies to embrace Thunderbolt 3, the multi-purpose cable which can deliver data, video, and power over a single connection. The move has already won approval from Apple and Microsoft. It’s probably fair to say that neither Thunderbolt nor Thunderbolt 2 had quite the game-changing impact Intel and others hoped for. The high-speed interconnects were billed as the answer to rapidly increasing data throughput demands of virtual reality, 4K+ video editing, and more. They’d even blur the lines between internal and external upgrades, so the promise went; none embraced such a vision as completely – and, with hindsight, so disastrously – as Apple with the cylindrical Mac Pro. That revolution didn’t happen. Peripherals, when there were released, proved to be unduly expensive; many professionals in the creative industries Thunderbolt was pitched to decided that USB 3.0 was fast enough. Now, Intel is looking to avoid making the same mistakes with Thunderbolt 3. The chip company announced a two-step process to that end today. For a start, Thunderbolt 3 will be integrated into future Intel CPUs. Rather than the current system, which requires a separate Thunderbolt 3 controller, Intel will bake support into the CPU silicon. It’ll demand less board space, opening the door to slimmer and smaller notebooks and tablets, while also being more power efficient since there’ll be fewer components. Arguably more important, though, is Intel’s decision to scrap licensing fees. Next year, the chip company says, it’ll make the Thunderbolt protocol specification available to the tech industry under a nonexclusive, royalty-free license. In short, companies making accessories, peripherals, and systems using the technology will be able to implement Thunderbolt 3 without having to pay Intel for the privilege, while third-party companies will be able to make their own versions of the controllers. “Releasing the Thunderbolt protocol specification in this manner is expected to greatly increase Thunderbolt adoption by encouraging third-party chip makers to build Thunderbolt-compatible chips,” Chris Walker, vice president of the Client Computing Group and general manager of the Mobility Client Platform​ at Intel, suggests. “We expect industry chip development to accelerate a wide range of new devices and user experiences.” As you might expect, having worked with Intel on the initial Thunderbolt development, Apple is already onboard with the idea. It launched the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar last year, ditching every legacy connector but the 3.5mm headphone jack in favor of four USB Type-C Thunderbolt 3 ports. Each of those ports can supply power to the notebook, hook up to a data peripheral such as an external drive, or be used to connect a display. It’s in the Cupertino firm’s best interest to see adoption increase more broadly, and help its users avoid living “that dongle life.” Microsoft, meanwhile, has been stung with criticism recently for not equipping its latest machines – the Surface Laptop, announced earlier this year, and the Surface Pro that was revealed yesterday – with Thunderbolt 3 or indeed USB Type-C ports of any sort. However, it too says it’s working with Intel to embrace the interconnect. “The Windows 10 Creators Update enhanced plug-and-play support for Thunderbolt 3 devices,” Roanne Sones, general manager, Strategy and Ecosystem for Windows and Devices, said of Intel’s news, “with additional enhancements planned for future OS releases.” Almost 150 different PC designs and systems using Thunderbolt 3 are expected to be on the market by the end of the year, Intel predicts. Meanwhile it’s expecting docking stations, super-fast external storage, and 4K virtual reality headsets getting power, data, and video from a single cable from a PC to hit the market.

Click to Skip Ad Closing in... Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile New iPhone 8 pictures mean our worst nightmare might be happening Chris Mills @chrisfmills May 24th, 2017 at 2:16 PM Share Tweet If this new series of leaks is correct, Apple could be about to make a huge mistake. The biggest outstanding question about the iPhone 8’s design is whether it will have a Touch ID sensor on the rear, or build a fingerprint scanner into the screen itself. Rear-mounted fingerprint sensors, conveniently placed in optimum smudging location next to the camera, are a slap in the face to common sense. Samsung went that route with the Galaxy S8 this year, but a recent series of leaks suggested that Apple had come up with a better solution. Now, we’re not so sure. Don't Miss: Somehow, everyone walked away from this massive Tesla crash Images that appeared on Weibo, spotted by 9to5Mac, show the front and back of an iPhone 8 in different colors. Most of the design lines up perfectly with other leaks we’ve seen: dual camera lenses, mounted vertically, and a full-screen edge-to-edge display on the front. But none of that really matters. What we’re focusing on here is the Touch ID sensor, prominently located on the back. It looks exactly like the Touch ID sensor you’re used to seeing on the iPhone, but located just below the Apple logo on the rear. That, by the way, lines up perfectly with a set of schematics that were shared last month. Now, it’s perfectly possible that those schematics and these images are fake. It’s incredibly simple to Photoshop one button into an image, especially since we have plenty of references for what a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor would look like. But the fact is that we definitely can’t rule out a rear-mounted Touch ID sensor on the iPhone 8. Playing devil’s advocate for a second, the execution of the Touch ID sensor in these images isn’t the worst. The major problem with how Samsung did the rear-mounted sensor on the Galaxy S8 is location: it sits right next to the camera, meaning you’re guaranteed to smudge the lens up all the time. In this image, you can see that the fingerprint sensor is much lower than the camera, nearly in the middle of the phone. The camera module is also in the top-right of the phone, far enough away from the fingerprint sensor that you probably can’t even reach it when holding the phone with one hand. Don’t get me wrong: moving from a front-mounted fingerprint sensor to one on the back is still a step back, and all of my fingers are crossed hoping that this leak is a fake. But if Apple is going to screw up the design, at least we can hope it’ll screw it up elegantly.

Wondering how best to stream audio from your Mac to a speaker or digital receiver? You don’t buy the device, you buy the ecosystem Apple vs. Android: Buy the Ecosystem, Not the Gadget Apple vs. Android: Buy the Ecosystem, Not the Gadget You love your Android phone and want to buy a tablet. Everyone tells you the iPad is the best tablet, and it really is the best; but you should still buy an Android tablet. Read More . If you own Apple stuff, you’re generally better off buying more Apple stuff than dipping your toes into other closed platforms. So here are our top picks for iPhone, iPad and Mac users who want to cut the cord. Apple’s W1 Chip The W1 is Apple’s answer to wireless audio. It uses the Bluetooth standard, but improves things a fair bit in more ways than one. For convenience, W1-enabled headphones pair effortlessly based on proximity. Turn them on, hold them close to your iPhone and they’ll pair automatically. From here, your Mac and iPad will pair with your earphones using iCloud, so you can quickly switch between devices without having to re-pair over Bluetooth. You can still pair non-Apple devices using regular old Bluetooth, which is handy if you also have a Windows laptop or use an Android device for work. The W1 chip is also incredibly power-efficient, and offers fast charging to boot. A few minutes of charge time can mean a few hours of listening time, while ultra-low power consumption reduces the need for large battery packs. Since Apple purchased Beats, charging is all performed using a Lightning cable — which is handy because many iPhone users won’t leave the house without one Avoid These iPhone Apps for Better Battery Life Avoid These iPhone Apps for Better Battery Life Killing background apps won't save your battery — in some cases you'll have to completely avoid an app in order to stop it from draining your smartphone's energy. Read More . Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the W1 chip also offers what is probably the best wireless audio quality on the consumer market. Ultimately the resulting sound quality depends on which W1-enabled product you buy, but your choice to use wireless audio over a traditional cable won’t result in noticeably worse sound quality. While it’s unlikely these points will convince you to buy AirPods or Beats headphones on their own, as a package, the W1 brings together some compelling advancements: excellent wireless sound quality, low power consumption, convenient fast charging over lightning, and an end to the often irksome process of pairing over Bluetooth. The takeaway is that W1 devices are convenient, even if you can get better sound quality elsewhere. AirPods ($159) AirPods are Apple’s flaship earphones, which means they’re a bit fancier than the other W1-enabled options on this list. The design itself is notable, as each earphone is worn separately with no cord to join them in the middle. Personal preference will dictate whether you like the AirPod look. You’ll get five hours worth of listening on a full charge, with 15 minutes of charging providing four hours of listening time. When not in use, your AirPods will live in a chargeable case that keeps them powered up, for up to 24 hours of listening time on the move. The smart tech doesn’t stop there. AirPods use optical sensors and accelerometers to detect when you’re wearing them, which starts and stops the music automatically. Microphones are used to isolate background noise and focus on your voice during calls. You can also double-tap or just say “Hey Siri!

Perhaps the biggest drawback to AirPods is that they fit just like Apple’s free EarPods Sound Advice: Are Apple's Free EarPods Really That Bad? Sound Advice: Are Apple's Free EarPods Really That Bad? Apple's free earphones have a reputation being utter garbage — but are we being too harsh on the pearly white fashion accessories? Read More that come with every new iPhone purchase. There are no tight-fitting silicone earbuds to isolate background noise, and the hard plastic isn’t particularly comfortable. BeatsX ($149) The other option for iPhone users who want to go wireless is to opt for Apple’s BeatsX. These lack most of the fancy tech that makes AirPods so special, while focusing on providing a fitted earphone and the signature Beats bass boost. There’s no “Hey Siri!” functionality, no sensors or automatic music control, and no microphones to remove background noise. The BeatsX are joined in the middle by a wire that hangs around your neck, with a simple three-button remote and microphone. You do however get four pairs of fitted silicon ear buds in the box, and BeatsX run for a full eight hours on a single charge. A quick five-minute charge provides two hours of listening time, with a full recharge barely taking 20 minutes. They’ve even toned down the mushy bass response to a point where non-electronic music is listenable. Read our full BeatsX review to see what we thought, but ultimately they’re the more comfortable and slightly cheaper option right now. If you don’t care about hands-free Siri and don’t mind a bass-heavy sound, then you’ll probably be very happy with a pair of BeatsX. Powerbeats 3 Wireless ($199) If you’re looking specifically for sports headphones, the Powerbeats 3 Wireless ($199) are a good choice. While the BeatsX come with removable “wings” to keep the earbuds in place, Powerbeats take this to the next level with a clip that attaches your headphones directly to your ears. They’re built for listening to music during vigorous workouts come rain, wind, or shine. That means they’re also sweat and water resistant, while the BeatsX and AirPods are not. I wasn’t able to find a specific water resistant rating for the earphones, and while they’re suitable for a run in the rain or a particularly sweaty workout, they’re not waterproof and you can’t take them swimming. You’ll need to spend a bit more money for truly waterproof earphones. Expect the bass-heavy sound of Beats, a battery life of up to 12 hours, and fast charging to boot. Users seem split over how comfortable the clip is, so it’s worth trying them on before laying down $200. The Powerbeats 3 Wireless are available in six different color designs and use a similar “necklace” design to the BeatsX. Beats Solo 3 ($299) At present there’s only one pair of over-the-top headphones that use the W1 chip: the Beats Solo 3. Based on their design, they’re probably the most comfortable pair currently available for sale. The traditional yet bulky construction makes them ideal for longer listening sessions, though you might find them a bit too big for use outside of the house or office. Alternatively, you might not care. While they lack the subtlety of the BeatsX in-ear headphones, they pack a huge 40-hour battery into the headband and come in your choice of eight different colors. We haven’t had a chance to listen to the Beats Solo 3, but expect a heavy bass response that’s befitting of modern music. Better yet, try them on and have a listen to a variety of music before you buy. The Solo 3 headphones also include the same fast-charging technology found in Apple’s other W1-enabled headphones. A quick five minute blast is enough for three hours of listening at a moderate volume. They also include the same dual beam-forming microphone tech seen in Apple’s AirPods, which results in better voice clarity while taking calls or barking orders at Siri. While the Beats Solo 3 are larger headphones to be worn over the head, they use an on-ear cup design which might not be to everyone’s tastes. These tend to be more compact than over-ear headphones, but can be uncomfortable for those who wear glasses or have “incompatible” ear piercings. Try before you buy! Alternatively: Regular Old Bluetooth If none of these appeal to you, then you might want to wait and see what the future holds. There will surely be a W2 chip arriving at some point, and it’s even possible that Apple may license the W1 chip in the same way they have their AirPlay technology to third-party manufacturers. The other thing you could do is buy a different pair of wireless headphones that don’t use Apple’s W1 chip. The problem with the W1 chip is that so far, there are only a handful of models available. Apple also happens to make them all. If you don’t like any of the current crop, you’re either going to have to wait or grab a decent pair of regular old Bluetooth headphones Best Bluetooth Headphones in 2016 Best Bluetooth Headphones in 2016 Android and Apple phones may dispense with their audio jacks.

The odds that the agency is able to break into the device are, however, slim. For now, the government has sent the iPhone to the U.S., seeking assistance from its federal agencies. The government’s strategy of shipping it abroad to decipher its contents is unsustainable. But for some political agreements signed after the 26/11 attacks, there is no legal obligation on the U.S. to provide any assistance in this matter to India, even though the company that manufactured the device is American. Moreover, U.S. security agencies have themselves struggled to extract information from devices like the iPhone, in the face of resolute opposition from companies to decrypt their own products. If Apple could successfully resist a U.S. court order to help the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) unlock an iPhone used by a terrorist involved in the 2015 San Bernardino attacks, what hope can the NIA have? Walled by encryption In the eight years since its creation, the NIA has grown into a competent organisation, with interception abilities comparable to top law enforcement bodies in the world. But NIA officials themselves rue that the online chatter they intercept is increasingly encrypted. Thus far, Indian intelligence agencies have relied on ‘zero days’ — vulnerabilities that exist in the original design of a software — to break into encrypted devices, but Internet companies now promptly patch their flaws, diminishing the utility of such tools. Take the case of Abu Dujana’s iPhone 7. While dealing with secure devices, law enforcement agencies usually have two options to unlock them. The first is to “brute force” the user’s password or PIN into the phone repeatedly, until it finally cracks open. But iPhones limit the number of false entries, killing the phone altogether after several failed attempts. In the San Bernardino case, the FBI was probably able to trick the iPhone — an older version, the iPhone 5c — into believing the limit was never reached. With newer models from Apple, this has become altogether impossible, because an isolated processor within the phone keeps a running count of all consecutive false attempts. The second option is to modify the ‘Touch’ sensor in phones that use fingerprints-recognition technology, so that a third party is grafted in as the legitimate user. Last year, however, Apple issued a software update that disables all iPhones where the Touch button had been “unofficially” modified. The company later allowed users to restore dead devices, but only after confirming their identity on other Apple platforms like iTunes. The reality is that a lot of online content is today out of the reach of law enforcement officials. Platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram are ‘end-to-end’ encrypted, making it difficult for police at the State and local level — who don’t have access to zero days — to register cases based on information contained in them. The distinct trend towards greater adoption of encryption poses a dilemma for Indian policymakers. Strong encryption protocols increase consumer confidence in the digital economy, but the Indian government fears a scenario where criminals or terrorists can easily “go dark” behind secure channels. In this case, Apple could build firmware that allows agencies to clock any number of attempts to unlock an iPhone. Technical details aside, the lesson here is that Apple may tightly secure its devices, but it also guards the “keys to the kingdom”. Similarly, Telegram does not disclose to government officials if it has an office in that country, to “shelter” them from data requests. Emerging markets have struggled to deal with data giants — Brazil’s judiciary, for example, suspended WhatsApp on three occasions in 2016 for non-compliance with government requests — that operate on quasi-sovereign principles. The need to deal directly Finally, legal solutions to electronic data access for law enforcement agencies are outdated. Governments are no longer the custodians of data, but every Indian request for electronic content is required to be vetted by the U.S. Department of Justice. In Abu Dujana’s case, if he has backed up his data on Apple’s iCloud service, an Indian request to share its content will take months to be processed, by which time the cloud data would have already been erased through another device. The current process of information-sharing through the India-U.S. Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty suffers from almost irreparable hurdles, ranging from bureaucratic delays on both sides to inconsistencies in domestic legal standards. Perhaps the solution lies in a bilateral data-sharing agreement to help the Indian government engage with Internet companies directly, rather than routing requests through the U.S. government. Both sides have begun negotiations on this issue, which Prime Minister Narendra Modi should also flag with U.S. President Donald Trump when he visits Washington D.C. next month.

So it's surprising that two of the largest, IBM and Apple, are moving backward, preparing for office life in the decades ahead to look a lot like 2005. Thinkstock Advertisement We look to technology companies to build the economy of future. They supply the vision and the means to make us more productive and efficient, with tools like personal computers, smartphones and high-speed internet connections. Tech companies are supposed to be the leaders. So it's surprising that two of the largest, IBM and Apple, are moving backward, preparing for office life in the decades ahead to look a lot like 2005. They are likely to be wrong. IBM is ending its liberal policy that encouraged remote work, now forcing employees back into offices to facilitate collaboration. Meanwhile, Apple is preparing to open its vast new $5 billion corporate campus in Silicon Valley. Silicon Valley culture is seen as the pinnacle of corporate success because of the explosive growth of the technology sector over the past 20 years. Apple, Google, Facebook, Netflix, Tesla, Uber and others have created products and companies that are the envy of the world. And they've done it in part by breaking the norms of what used to be considered corporate culture. Casual dress codes like Mark Zuckerberg's hoodie. Open floor plans instead of cubicles or stuffy offices. And walkable campuses with on-site amenities and free meals to cater to engineers working long hours. Popular Now How to Reduce Costs through Supply Chain Network Optimization Top 25 Supply Chains of 2015 12 Key Strategies to Achieving a Work-Life Balance And outside of Silicon Valley, more and more companies have relocated from suburbs to dense, walkable urban areas. They've done this for a variety of reasons. Productivity and innovation are believed to be higher in dense areas. But perhaps more importantly, dense, urban areas are where young, talented, college-educated people -- millennials -- increasingly want to live, and companies want to be close to the pools of talent they're chasing. Although in the 2010s these millennials are young, single renters in walkable urban places, those same millennials in the 2020s will be in a different phase of life. They'll be getting married and having kids, they won't have as much free time, and they will be buying houses in more-affordable suburbs where the schools are better. Corporate offices located in walkable urban areas or in communities with exorbitant housing costs won't be as good of a fit for these aging millennials. For midlife millennials, flexible work arrangements and remote work -- the kinds of work IBM is abandoning -- are what workers will want. And rather than being a desirable attraction, Apple's shiny new headquarters located in a region with million-dollar home prices may be an albatross for the company, if even well-paid workers cannot afford to live near the office. There's a certain irony in Apple opening its new headquarters at the same time that Silicon Valley employment might be peaking. Employment in the San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara metro area has not increased since July. It's unlikely that this is because of any kind of technology-sector downtown, but rather because of the region's 3.4 percent unemployment rate and difficulty in building new housing. Office life in 2025, rather than being about 20-something millennials clustering in downtowns or on lavish Silicon Valley campuses, is likely to be more about 30-something millennials spreading out into the suburbs and away from high-priced metro areas. Facing acute labor shortages, companies will be doing anything they can to win those workers' services. Tech companies did pioneer the solution; IBM's old model will be the template for more and more companies.

By David Nield posted May 24th, 2017 at 2:02pm Welcome to the future of payments. Apple Most of us leave the house carrying three essentials: keys, wallet, and smartphone. But over the past few years, more and more people are combining the latter two objects. No, we're not talking about phone cases that also hold cash. Your smartphone can store your financial details and use them to make secure, instant payments in the store. It may feel vaguely futuristic, but you can check out with a wave of your mobile—as long as the place you're shopping has the necessary hardware. If you're new to the world of app-based payments, but want to upgrade from the old cash and cards approach, it's easier than you might think to get set up. In fact, you have most of what you'll need already installed on your phone. Here are your payment options. For iPhone users Apple Pay Apple Pay works with the iPhone 6 and later. Apple Apple Pay first saw the light of day in October 2014. Now it comes pre-installed on most of Apple's hardware products, including the Apple Watch and the iPhone (at least on version 6 or later). You can use this program to pay for purchases online, within apps, and in physical stores: Any outlet that supports contactless payments, such as Best Buy, Staples, the Disney Store, Starbucks, Walgreens, and many more, will accept Apple Pay. To set up Apple Pay on an iPhone, open Settings, then choose Wallet & Apple Pay. From here, you can link your credit or debit cards to the phone's payment system. It also lets you add new cards and edit the details from existing ones. To add the same card or cards to your Apple Watch, use the Watch app. Go to the My Watch tab and tap on the Wallet & Apple Pay option. This will give your wearable the same paying power as the card you've added, which means you'll be able to pay with your smart watch even when your iPhone isn't nearby. Apple Pay on the iPhone You can easily add cards from major banks inside iOS. David Nield/Popular Science Once you enter your card details, you're ready to pay for goods. To do this in a physical store, you can use any contactless terminal, even if it doesn't display an Apple Pay sign (though the sign is worth looking out for). As long as the checkout takes contactless payments, it should work with Apple Pay as well. Unlock your phone with a passcode or Touch ID, to prove it's actually you using it, then tap your iPhone (or Apple Watch) on the terminal to pay. This system works works through a technology called Near Field Communication, or NFC. Your card details aren't actually beamed from your phone to the terminal. Your device simply confirms that it's authorized to act on your behalf, using an encrypted code it received when you registered your card with it the first time. Because this system is unfamiliar, it may breed security concerns. But Apple Pay can actually protect your money better than a card. While someone who steals your credit card would then be able to make multiple payments with it, that's not possible with an iPhone—they would need the phone's Touch ID or passcode to access your earnings. For Android users Android Pay Like Apple Pay, Android Pay should work at any terminal that supports contactless cards. Google Android Pay launched in September 2015, a year after Apple's payment system, and it works in a very similar way. Its primary purpose is to let you quickly pay at the checkout in a retail store, but the tech has also found its way to apps and online shopping. Android Pay works on phones and tablets using Android 4.4 or higher, as well as Android Wear watches (such as the LG Watch Sport) that include both NFC and Android Wear 2.0. You can manage all of your cards and other payment information through the Android Pay app on your phone. If you already have registered certain cards with Google (for in-app payments and the like), then you can quickly add these to Android Pay with just a few taps. On an Android Wear watch, you will need to install the Android Pay app separately, then use it to select one of the cards you've previously placed on your phone. Like with Apple Pay, you need to have some sort of lock on your phone (like a fingerprint or passcode) to use Android Pay, as this can verify your identity. If you're using a smartwatch, you don't need to unlock your phone every time you pay. However, if you take your watch off, then you will need to reauthorize the connection (by unlocking your phone) the next time you use Android Pay in a physical store. Android Pay should work with any terminal or checkout that supports contactless payments, though you can also look out for the Android Pay badge. Outlets from Macy's to Whole Foods have signed up for the system. In the store, make sure your phone is unlocked, tap it against the terminal for a few seconds, and wait for the green light. Again, the system will send an authorized token rather than your actual card details—just one more way that Apple and Android Pay resemble each other. Samsung Pay Samsung Pay works with contactless technology and the older magnetic stripe method. Samsung Samsung Pay, despite the name, works on any modern Android phone, not just Samsung devices. You can also install it on the Gear S2 and Gear S3 smartwatches. Once you've added the Samsung Pay app to your device, add your cards within the app. When it comes time to pay, simply unlock your phone (which can even be done via an iris scan on a Galaxy S8), and then hold your phone against the terminal to use your card. Samsung Pay has one big advantage over Apple Pay and Android Pay: It works with both contactless terminals and those terminals that use the old magnetic stripe technology. In the latter case, however, you do need a recent Samsung device, because the method requires extra in-phone hardware. That ability makes Samsung Pay compatible with a broader range of point-of-sale terminals. Other payment apps Square Cash The beauty of Square Cash is that you can send money to anyone with an email address. Square We've covered your options if you want to use your phone in a physical store. But what if you just want to pay back your friend for dinner, or settle the cable bill with your roommates? In this case, you've still got plenty of app options. Like with Apple, Android, or Samsung Pay, you will need to link these apps to a real bank account or card. But the process is usually pretty painless. PayPal (Android, iOS) is perhaps the best-known and one of the longest-running mobile payment options. Recently, its apps for phones have caught up to its desktop site in terms of ease-of-use and functionality. If you link a bank account to your PayPal, or accumulate a PayPal balance, you can pay anyone (at least, anyone else who has a PayPal account) for free. Although you can also link a debit or credit card, using this payment method will incur a fee of $0.30 plus 2.9 percent of the total amount. In the world of payment apps, Square Cash (Android, iOS) is the up-and-coming contender, looking to significantly improve the way we all send money to each other. Perhaps its best feature is that the person you're paying doesn't need their own Square Cash account: You can use the app to pay anyone whose email address you know. Square Cash lets you link debit cards for free, but adds a 3 percent charge for linked credit cards. For an even smoother experience than either PayPal or Square Cash, try Venmo (Android, iOS), which PayPal actually owns. This socially-connected option is built more like a messaging app than a payments tool. It even includes an option for splitting a bill. Payments are free from a linked bank account, major bank debit cards, or a Venmo balance. Otherwise, you face a 3 percent charge for credit cards. Like with PayPal, the person you're paying must have a Venmo account as well.

expertise MONEY & INVESTING ericBRETAN estaterick@gmail.com As those of you that have been reading this column for a while know, I am a big fan of Exchange Traded Funds and low-cost index mutual funds. By buying these securities, you are basically buying a certain sector of the market. For example, you can buy an index of just technology stocks, high dividend stocks, international bonds or even the entire S&P 500. It is an easy and cost effective method to either focus on a particular industry or diversify by buying hundreds of different securities with one purchase. However, a good friend of mine, Ryan Rupert of Morgan Stanley, recently wrote a very interesting piece on the dangers of these index securities. At first I was very skeptical of arguments against ETFs. How could they be harmful? But after pondering his analysis, I began to see how there could be a problem with owning index funds as they gain in popularity. To understand Ryan’s well thought-out arguments, it helps to take an extreme example. Let’s imagine that index funds become more and more popular until they dominate the marketplace and push out all actively managed funds like hedge funds. Now let’s say in this scenario, on a particular day, investors want more exposure to the market on a day where Apple reports poor earnings. The new money being put into the market goes to the index fund where the fund manager has no choice but to buy Apple because she has to buy the index and Apple makes up a significant part of the index. So, in this case Apple stock would go up even though they miss earnings. The point of the argument is that index funds distort stock valuations. The fund manager has no ability to buy or sell stocks based on earnings, management or market opportunities. In a world dominated by index ETFs, a biotech company that suddenly developed the cure for cancer would not see any movement in its stock price. Or a company like Sears, which used to be the largest retailer in the U.S., would continue to attract capital — passive funds would be forced to buy it because the company historically was a large component of the retail index. Beyond distorting stock valuations, index funds really go against the basic tenants of capitalism. Capital markets exist to funnel needed capital to the places where it is needed and can be rewarded. That means money should flow to successful companies and be siphoned away from unsuccessful ones. However, index funds don’t care about the success of companies; they only allocate capital according to index weighting. So does this mean I advise selling index funds and putting money with actively managed ones, or buying individual stocks? For me, I am sticking with my ETFs for the time being, for one main reason. I do not have the expertise to select active funds or managers that can outperform the market in the long run, after expensive fees. The same goes for stocks. I just don’t have the time or information to research individual stocks to know which will outperform the market. That being said, ironically, it is people like me — and the success of index funds — which actually make active funds more and more appealing. The more these passive funds attract capital, the more distorted stock valuations become and thus greater opportunities for stock pickers and active money managers. This also means that in a market selloff when investors are liquidating index funds, the stocks that make up a large portion of these funds, like Apple and Google, will be punished down beyond reason. Funds will be selling these high quality stocks even if they don’t deserve to be sold. In this case, it may make sense to buy these names. For now, I am sticking with my low-cost ETFs. But as market volatility increases, it will be interesting to see if these securities retain their popularity or if active management becomes more popular once again. ¦ — Eric Bretan, the co- owner of Rick’s Estate & Jewelry Buyers in Punta Gorda, was a senior derivatives marketer and investment banker for more than 15 years at several global banks.

Click to Skip Ad Closing in... Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile This is the first ever hands-on video showing a mockup of Apple’s iPhone 8 Image Source: Moe Slah Yoni Heisler @edibleapple May 24th, 2017 at 7:45 AM Share Tweet With iPhone 8 mass production inching closer with each passing week, the number of iPhone 8 leaks we’ve come across has increased markedly over the past few months. And while it’s no secret that Apple tends to test a myriad of different iPhone designs in the build-up to a new model release, the consistency of the leaked photos we’ve seen over the past few weeks alone suggest that the highly anticipated iPhone 8 will easily live up to the hype. Aside from an edge-to-edge OLED display with minimal bezels all around the device, it appears that Apple has figured out a way to embed its Touch ID sensor into the display itself. In other words, we thankfully won’t have to contend with an iPhone design with the Touch ID sensor located on the back. Don't Miss: Somehow, everyone walked away from this massive Tesla crash Photos of Apple’s upcoming iPhone 8 are certainly great, but noted leaker Benjamin Geskin recently upped the ante by uploading the first known video of what will presumably be Apple’s final iPhone 8 design. Originally posted to Twitter yesterday evening, the new iPhone 8 video is a dummy model that corroborates our own exclusive iPhone 8 leak we published just a few days ago. Put simply the iPhone 8 is going to be an incredibly sleek device and will finally provide users in the market for an upgrade a brand new iPhone design worth getting excited about. The video can be viewed below and it’s worth noting that Geskin previously said that the iPhone 8 will incorporate a “back glass and metal frame” such that it looks and feels like a single component. As a result, Geskin claims that the iPhone 8 design is “even more merged” than Samsung’s flagship Galaxy S8 to the extent that it will house “almost no transition between frame and glass.” While the video here gives us a broad sense of the device’s dimensions, it’s hard to know what to make of it without any additional context. Helping out in this regard, it’s worth referencing purported iPhone molds which emerged online over the weekend. As evidenced below, it appears that the iPhone 8 will be slightly longer than the 4.7-inch iPhone 7s. Additionally, the photos below suggest that the iPhone 8 may be slightly thicker and wider as well. So while early reports claimed that the iPhone 8 would have the same exact form factor as the current iPhone 7, that doesn’t appear to be the case. Aside from a bold and arguably long overdue redesign, the iPhone 8 will introduce a number of other compelling features, including more RAM, improved battery life, advanced facial recognition technology, support for augmented reality, and a 256GB storage tier. Taking this all into account, not to mention Apple’s growing user base, there’s a reason why many analysts believe the iPhone 8 will soon anchor the largest iPhone refresh in history. Price wise, the iPhone 8 is expected to fall somewhere in the $1,000 range, though it remains unclear if the entry-level iPhone 8 will be priced above or below that figure. As far as a release date is concerned, a number of reputable sources in recent days have indicated that Apple will release the iPhone 8 in September. This is welcome news given the plethora of relatively outdated analyst notes claiming that the iPhone 8 release date might be pushed back as far as November. Now the bad news is that the iPhone 8, even though it may see a September launch, will likely be severely supply constrained for quite a few weeks.

Tech trailblazer and co-founder of the Apple empire Steve Jobs' rise to fame in 90 seconds 01:33 Telegraph Reporters 24 May 2017 • 6:43pm Steve Jobs, who died on October 5, 2011, aged 56, was the visionary co-founder, and later chief executive, of Apple, makers of the Macintosh computer, the iMac, the iPod, iPad, and iPhone, and the man behind the astonishing success of the computer animation firm Pixar, makers of Toy Story and Finding Nemo; in consequence he did more to determine what films we watch, how we listen to music, and how we work and play than any other person on the planet. Jobs never designed a computer in his life, but it was because of him that Apple products, even when they do largely what other products do, are perceived to be different and infinitely more cool. The Macintosh introduced the world to the computer mouse; the iPod became famous for its click wheel, and the iPhone for its "user-interface" – a sophisticated touch-screen that responds to the flick of a finger. I wish Bill Gates well, I only wish that at some time in his life he had dropped acidSteve Jobs Jobs emphasised the difference between Macs and the PCs that ran Microsoft software, managing to preserve Apple's image as a plucky, creative, insurgent against the bland Microsoft behemoth even as Apple itself became the biggest company on the planet. "I wish Bill Gates well," he once claimed. "I only wish that at some time in his life he had dropped acid or spent time at an ashram." It was a marketing trick that Jobs worked on consumers too, convincing them that purchasing Apple products somehow conferred membership of an exclusive and visionary club, even when it was transparently obvious that the company's devices were utterly ubiquitous. This corporate reputation for seer-like trailblazing lay completely with Jobs. "I skate to where the puck is going to be," he explained, using an ice hockey metaphor, "not where it has been." Steve Jobs introducing the iPad during the launch of Apple's new tablet computer device in 2010 Credit: Reuters This inspired almost evangelical devotion among techno-geeks. Jobs was not just the brains behind Apple, he was high-priest of the "Mac" religion. His eagerly anticipated "MacWorld" shows were adulatory affairs akin to revivalist rallies, with Jobs, in black turtleneck, jeans and trainers, preaching the message that salvation lay in Apple's latest gadget. The Jobs story – humble birth, rise and fall, miraculous comeback – was even likened by Apple fanatics to the life of Christ. For the less blasphemously-inclined it proved that the American Dream is alive and well. He was born on February 24 1955 to an Syrian Arab father and an American mother, who had travelled to San Francisco to put him up for adoption. Soon afterwards a blue-collar California couple, Paul and Clara Jobs, claimed him and named him Steven Paul. After completing high school in Cupertino, northern California, Jobs went north to study at Reed College in Portland, Oregon, but dropped out after a term. Returning to California, he took a job at Atari, the video games manufacturer, in order to save money for a "spiritual quest" to India. There he was converted to Zen Buddhism and vegetarianism and dabbled in hallucinogenic drugs. Steve Jobs Apple - a life in pictures On his return to America Jobs resumed his work with Atari and was given the task of creating a more compact circuit board for the game Breakout. He had little interest in the intricacies of circuit board design and persuaded his 16-year old friend, Steve Wozniak, to do the job for him, offering to split any bonus fifty-fifty. Jobs was given $5,000 by a delighted Atari, but Wozniak only got $300, under the impression the payout was $600. In 1976 Wozniak showed Jobs a computer he had designed for his own use. Jobs was impressed and suggested marketing it. They had no capital, but Jobs had a brilliant idea. By persuading a local store to order 50 of the computers, then asking an electrical store for 30 days credit on the parts to build them, they set up business without a single investor. They called it Apple Computers (which would lead to protracted legal battles with the company behind the Beatles' record label, Apple Corps) and launched their first product, the Apple 1. A year later the more sophisticated Apple 2 hit the jackpot, and by 1980, when the company went public, the pair were multimillionaires. I skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it has beenSteve Jobs The success of Apple launched Jobs into the celebrity circuit. He dated Joan Baez and became a personal friend of California Governor Jerry Brown. But his ruthless streak became apparent aged 23 when his then girlfriend gave birth to his daughter. For two years, though already wealthy, he denied paternity while the baby's mother went on welfare. At one point he even swore an affidavit to the effect that he was "sterile and infertile", so could not be the father. The strain of running a successful company soon began to tell. Employees complained of Jobs's "Management By Walking Around Frightening Everyone" technique and even he realised that more seasoned business experience was required. In 1983 he lured John Sculley, president of PepsiCo, to serve as Apple's chief executive, saying: "Do you want to spend the rest of your life selling sugared water to children, or do you want a chance to change the world?" Two years later the company launched the Macintosh, the first commercially successful small computer with a mouse-driven "graphical user interface". But the clash of business cultures proved irreconcilable, and in 1985 Jobs (whom Sculley likened to Leon Trotsky) was forced out by his own board. It was 12 years before he returned. Profile | Steve Jobs During those years Jobs started Next Computing and bought what became Pixar from George Lucas, the director of Star Wars. Next was a techie's dream – Tim Berners-Lee wrote the software for the web on a Next computer – but a business failure. Pixar struggled for years until 1995, when it contracted with Disney to produce a number of computer-animated feature films. The first of these, Toy Story, broke box-office records and Pixar's flotation in 1996 made Jobs a billionaire. Over the next 10 years the studio went on to produce a string of hits including A Bug's Life (1998), Toy Story 2 (1999), Monsters, Inc. (2001), Finding Nemo (2003) and The Incredibles (2004). In 2006 Disney bought the company in a $7.4 billion deal under which Jobs became Disney's largest single shareholder with approximately 7 per cent of the company's stock. Jobs's triumph at Pixar reminded people of his ability to divine the technological future, and in 1997 he persuaded Apple to buy Next – to acquire its forward-looking operating system Nextstep, and, more importantly, Jobs himself. Early days: an old photograph of Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs, before they created Apple Credit: Reuters In his memoirs, published in 1987, John Sculley dismissed Jobs's vision for Apple to become a high tech consumer products company as a "lunatic plan". But by rejecting this vision, Apple, by 1997, had become a basket case, losing $736 million in one quarter. Management by committee had blunted its innovative flair and the corporate atmosphere was more that of a student bar than a thrusting business in a highly competitive market. Jobs's instinctive feel for the consumer zeitgeist soon turned things around. Within a year the company was once more posting handsome profits. The iMac computer was launched in 1998, followed in 2001 by the iPod, a digital music player of strikingly minimalist design. Then came iTunes digital music software, and the iTunes online digital music Store. In 2007, Apple entered the cellular phone business with the iPhone, a clever and expensive product combining cell phone, iPod, and internet device in one streamlined casing. The history of Apple 02:25 It was followed by the iPad, a tablet device without a physical keyboard. Some wondered if there was really demand for the iPad in a crowded marketplace that was being buffeted by the severest economic downturn in decades; once again Jobs showed his ability to confound the sceptics, and it became a bestseller too. But Jobs was not a universally popular figure. He oozed arrogance, was vicious about business rivals, and in contrast to, say, Bill Gates, refused to have any truck with notions of corporate responsibility. He habitually parked his Mercedes in the disabled parking slot at Apple headquarters and one of his first acts on returning to the company in 1997 was to terminate all of its corporate philanthropy programmes. Jobs's management style owed less to Zen Buddhism than to George Orwell. No aspect of corporate life was immune from his authority and he was almost pathologically controlling when it came to dealing with the press. Journalists found that he would try to stifle even anodyne stories if they had not received his blessing. One described getting an interview with Jobs as about as easy as getting an interview with Saddam Hussein, "except Saddam would probably be more helpful and certainly more polite". Steve Jobs posing with an iMac computer in 1998 Credit: Apple Corps He ruled Apple with a combination of foul-mouthed tantrums and charm, withering scorn and carefully judged flattery. People were either geniuses or "bozos", and those in his regular orbit found that they could flip with no warning from one category to the other, in what became known as the "hero-shithead roller coaster". Employees worried about getting trapped with Jobs in a lift, afraid that they might not have a job when the doors opened. One senior executive admitted that before heading into a meeting with Jobs, she embraced the mindset of a bullfighter entering the ring: "I pretend I'm already dead." Yet members of Jobs's inner circle, many of whom came with him from Next, found working with him an exhilarating experience. To keep them on board, Jobs eliminated most cash bonuses from executive compensation and started handing out stock options instead. But here as elsewhere Jobs played by his own rules. In 2001 he was granted stock options amounting to 7.5 million Apple shares, allegedly without the required authorisation from the company's board of directors. Furthermore, the option came with an exercise price of $18.30. The Steve Jobs story: a life in video 04:27 But this price allegedly should have been $21.10, thereby incurring a taxable charge of $20 million that Jobs did not report as income. In 2006 an internal company inquiry found that this grant was "improperly recorded" as having been made at a special board meeting that never took place, but largely exonerated Jobs over the matter, saying that the options had been returned without being exercised and that he was "unaware of the accounting implications". In 2007 the US Securities and Exchange Commission announced that it would not file charges against Apple, but had filed charges against two former executives for their alleged roles in backdating Apple options. The inquiry did not stall Apple's extraordinary ascent. By 2006 the company had a market value of $108 billion – more than Goldman Sachs. By August 2011, after it reported yet another quarter of record breaking profits, it had become the biggest company in the world, with a market value of $337 billion. Steve Jobs posing with a fourth generation iPhone in 2010, a year before he died Credit: AP Within days of reaching that corporate milestone, however, Jobs announced his resignation on health grounds. Few were surprised. In 2004 he disclosed that he had been diagnosed with a rare form of pancreatic cancer that had been "cured" by surgery. Questions about his health resurfaced in December 2008 when it was announced that, for the first time in 12 years, he was pulling out of delivering his annual address at Macworld. Feverish speculation over his well-being was only fuelled by Apple's fanatical devotion to secrecy. When Jobs went on medical leave in January 2009, the company would not say why. Inevitably, suspicions arose that the cancer had returned. In fact in June that year the Wall Street Journal revealed that he had undergone a liver transplant. Even when the news broke Apple remained tight-lipped: "Steve continues to look forward to returning at the end of June, and there's nothing further to say," noted a spokeswoman tersely. The Apple inventions that never surfaced His devoted fans began to scrutinise every public appearance for clues to Jobs's physical fitness. On the stock markets, which considered his presence vital to Apple's own health, the company's shares fell if he looked particularly gaunt. In the first half of 2011 he was seen only a handful of times. Then, on August 24, he announced he was stepping down, to be replaced as chief executive by Tim Cook, who had run the company during Jobs's previous absences. Apple's shares immediately dropped 5 per cent. Steve Jobs married Laurene Powell in a Buddhist ceremony in 1991. They had three children who survive him along with the daughter by his early girlfriend, whose paternity he eventually acknowledged.

As always, it has kept the tech enthusiasts as well as the general audience on their toes with all these rumors and speculations. All the iPhones from Apple have always been the centre of attraction for the entire smartphone world. Recently, there has been almost confirmed news about new iPhones in development and about to be launched this year. In case you missed them, the following will describe all the speculations for iPhone 7S, 7S Plus and iPhone 8. The prices of iPhones have always been high as compared to their peers in other brands. However, we suggest you that check the best prices in sites like Mysmartprice, PriceJugaad UAE and get the best deal;  especially with the month of Ramadan coming and different retailers trying to woo the customers with rock bottom prices. iPhone 7S and 7S Plus: Specifications There is a rumor than the 7S Plus will get a bump in the RAM department similar to that of 7 Plus. It would have a 3GB RAM. There is no such rumor for the iPhone 7S. It might not get the up gradation and would be retaining the 2GB RAM. We might see three variants depending upon the storage which would be 32GB, 128GB, and 256GB. The iPhone 7S and 7S Plus will likely have an upgraded processor which will be an A11 chip. This chip will use a manufacturing process of 10nm and will be much faster than the A10 Fusion one. Image Source: iphone7update.com Design Apple might ramp up the IP ratings from IP67 to IP68. This means now the phone can be submerged up to 5 feet and for about 30 minutes as compared to 3.3 feet in iPhone 7. The other design might be similar to the iPhone 7. They will sport LCD screens and not OLED ones that are being suggested for iPhone 8. They will also be in a wraparound display rather than the usual flat design in current ones. The iPhone 7S will have a screen size of 4.7 inches whereas the 7S Plus will have a 5.5-inch screen. The company may experiment with the back panel of the phone and could come up with ceramic, plastic or glass backs for iPhone 7. Camera They may feature a dual lens that will be mounted vertically. Apple, in collaboration with LG, will create these dual cameras which will develop 3D photos. It is to be noted that LG was the company behind the 7 Plus camera and also recently Apple has patented a 3D object and gesture technology. Whether the patented technology will be used in the upcoming release is still a matter of speculation. The other functionalities would be same as of iPhone 7. An unnamed Taiwanese supplier has let loose that there will be vertical setup for the camera and not the current horizontal ones. Release Date It is suggested that the company will launch the iPhone 7S and 7S Plus somewhere in the mid of the month September in 2017. Although another report suggests that Apple might release it a bit earlier. Despite the premium colour jet black, the earlier version was quite a hit among the audience. Apple is planning to do the same for the 7S. Apple has already launched a special edition of the colour red for the 7 and 7 Plus partnering with the HIV AIDS charity. So, a red variant in the new models is also very likely. The iPhone 7S model might be a mid-range device or may even stand amongst the lower range of iPhones. The price of iPhone 7S will be around $700- 800 considering the trend of price hike with each release. iPhone 8: Specifications It will have the upgraded processor chip, i.e. A11 processor. It will also have 3GB RAM similar to 7S and 7S Plus. There might be only 64GB and 256GB variants only for internal configurations. Image Source: youtube.com Design Since it is made to mark the 10th anniversary of the iPhone series, it is speculated that the looks will be different this time. It will have a bezel-less screen that will alter the overall design. It is rumoured that the fingerprint sensor will have embedded Touch ID in the display; Although another report suggests that the sensor might be shifted to the back of the phone, below the logo. This is similar to the other Android phones like Mi. It will have 2.5D curved glass panels on front and back with stainless steel frame holding them together. There has been a Twitter leak about an oversize sleep/wake key and speaker cutout which is similar to iPhone 7. iPhone 8 would also be using organic LED (OLED) screen which gives deeper blacks. It is also thinner when compared with LCD. Apple had used this technology in their watches. It could also have True Tone technology similar to that of iPad Pro which means the white light will adjust according to the ambient light. Camera The front camera will have dual lenses technology, and the company will use its components from Sony. Like iPhone 7, the rear camera would also be dual lenses, but the setup might change from horizontal to vertical orientation. The other functionalities would same as of iPhone 7. It is rumoured that the iPhone 8 will have a revolutionary infrared sensor for the front camera. It would be able to sense 3D space while taking selfies. This means that the feature of facial recognition will be enhanced or the video game characters might get replaced with the real you. Just like Samsung Galaxy S8, the front camera would also be equipped to power the iris sensor technology. Similar to iPhone 7S and 7S Plus, it would also allow for 3D photography. Release Date The iPhone 8 might be released in October 2017, a month later the release of iPhone 7S and 7S Plus. It may well cost above $1000. There is also the rumor that this time the company might add Airpods in the package. But this would mean that the price will shoot up again. So, these are the leaks and rumors about the upcoming iPhones in 2017. It may come up with fold able display technology with future iPhones, just like that of Samsung’s in collaboration with LG. Apple has never been the one to shy about the prices. The company is planning to reap the benefits of its upcoming $1000+ model. Whether Apple gets it right or not this time, only time will tell.

Skip to content 512 Pixels About Projects Membership Sponsor RSS → An Interview with Noah Leon, the Creator Behind the ‘Love Notes to Newton’ Film Project  May 24, 2017May 23, 2017 ⌘ Permalink Recently, I linked to (and backed) an Indiegogo project named Love Notes to Newton. It’s by a guy named Noah Leon. Here’s his pitch: Newton was the first mass-produced touchscreen handheld computer made by Apple. It only lasted a few years on the market (1993 to 1998), but that wasn’t because it sucked! A large community of people still love Newton, and this film is an homage to the little device(s) by the people who still remember and even still use one. I spent some time with Noah to talk about his work and this project. Our interview is below. Can you provide some background on who you are, and the project in general? I am 33 and run a small production company out of Montreal called Moosefuel Media. I have a wife, daughter, and I’ve been wanting to do a personal project about Newton and the Newt community for several years now. I’m a creative person and the idea of it just captured my imagination and I realized the time is right to make it. The Newton is a line of tablet computers from the 90s which predates the iPad, iPhone, and even the iPod. It was almost a huge commercial success, and the fact that it was so good but still didn’t make it in the market is a source of angst for us who love it. It drives us to keep it going so we can still enjoy it. It has really amazing software. I don’t know if people realize it, but Apple helped developed the ARM processor for the Newton line. ARM is what powers nearly all mobile devices today. So, why the Newton? What makes it special to you? I think it was just the idea of it which drew me in. It was a different way of looking at computers at the time. Everyone knew that eventually you would have computers you could carry around, and Apple really bet hard that they could pull it off. As a kid, when our school got Macs, it was a revelation to me that a computer could be used to make art. It started me on the path I am on today. When I first heard about the Newton it was no different. I was excited by the possibilities of what I could do with it. It wasn’t just a miniaturized Mac or PC; it was a different concept of what a computer should be. Ultimately it didn’t catch on, but it was excellent technology, especially for the time. It had all the standard apps which we expect on our phones today, but all the apps were integrated. There were no files, just a large database which all apps could store and share data from. The handwriting recognition used something called Neural networks which is a sort of A.I. It was pretty advanced for the time and to use it was kind of magical. Why did Apple cancel the product? Was doing so a mistake? I think cancelling Newton was the right choice ultimately, as painful as it was, from a business perspective. Apple had been very poorly managed for several years prior to 1998 and they had to cut their losses. That said, the early 90s was a very creative time for Apple, and some of their most ambitious products came during this time. However, Jobs killed all that when he came back to Apple. The Newton was before its time, and it took Apple until the iPhone to get back into the PDA market (PDA stands for Personal Digital Assistant, a term which Apple coined). Tell me a little bit about the Newton community today. I think there are a lot of Apple nuts who still enjoy using their Newtons, or who picked one up years later when they became affordable. There are also a lot of people who developed software or hardware around the Newton who are still involved. The real core of people who still actively use or tinker with Newtons are active in the newtontalk.net mailing list. Grant Hutchinson in Canada runs the list now. There are members from Germany, France, New Zealand, the United States and other countries. There is a lot of practical discussion, but also a lot of humor and talk about poutine. Do you still use one? I still use it occasionally, but now just for note-taking and todo lists. I used to be a big journaler, and the Newton has a very organic way of working with writing that is enjoyable to me. What’s the goal of the project? Will the film be made regardless of its outcome? The goal of the project is partly to tell the story of Newton, but more importantly, I want to tell the stories of the people who keep it going. Some of these people are heroes to me, but once you get out of the niche, nobody knows who they are. Some of them have really great stories to tell. I also hope to interview some of the people involved with the creation of Newton, to talk about their excitement and what they were thinking in developing this pen-based computer which was really ambitious for 1993 when it came out. Crowdfunding a project like this is a challenge since it’s very narrow and the people who remember Newton are pretty spread out. That said, I am committed to making the film regardless, and I think it will be a fun film which everyone will want to watch. I can’t do it without support, but we already have a good base. The amount of funding which comes through will really affect the production value and the number of people I am able to interview, so the better we do the better the film will be ultimately. Finally, once the film is finished and all crowdfunding “perks” have been delivered (t-shirts, for example), the profits from the further sale of the film will go to bethematch.org. Certain kinds of cancer require bone marrow or stem-cell transplants from a compatible donor, but it has to be a very exact match, so I signed up to be a donor to the Canadian chapter after I heard former Mac and Newton developer Steve Capps talk about it at the Computer History Museum. So once the film is finished and we begin selling it on Vimeo or iTunes, the money will go to a good cause. The film is about Newton but it’s also about people, so I wanted to do something special.

Tech Search Search CybersecurityNewly Discovered Vulnerability Raises Fears of Another WannaCry Cyber Attack Harley-DavidsonHarley-Davidson Is Building a Factory in Thailand to Serve Southeast Asia FacebookFacebook Reportedly Signs BuzzFeed, Vox and Others for Original Video Shows Career AdviceWhy You Should Take a Sabbatical From Work Nicolas Rapp apple iphone The iPhone Decade Aaron Pressman,Nicolas Rapp May 24, 2017 The design for the device that would revolutionize mobile phones and, eventually, the culture at large, arose from hatred. When considering whether to create the iPhone, Apple CEO Steve Jobs found that people largely despised the phones that they had. “Everybody has a cell phone, but I don’t know one person who likes their cell phone,” he once told John Lasseter, Pixar’s chief creative officer. To create a phone people would actually love, Jobs latched onto an important innovation: the touch screen. The display was the key to creating a computing chameleon: a device that could be a phone one minute, a camera the next, and a gaming pad the next. Nicolas Rapp  The master showman unveiled his smartphone in January 2007 with one of the most brilliant sales pitches ever. “Today, we’re introducing three revolutionary products,” Jobs said with a bit of misdirection, as the iPhone would be all three: phone, iPod, and Internet device. Steve Ballmer, then Microsoft’s CEO, laughed. Clayton Christensen, the Harvard business professor who turned the world on to the notion of “creative destruction,” scratched his head. But the public’s reaction after the iPhone’s release on June 29 was anything but skeptical. Ten years later, it’s clear that the critics were wrong. Consumers were right. Again. Sales started briskly and then went into overdrive after Apple cut the starting price of its second model, the iPhone 3G, to $199 with a wireless contract. More important, one year in, Apple introduced a critical new feature that Jobs had initially resisted: the App Store. It enabled iPhone users to buy and install mobile programs from third-party developers directly to their phones, unleashing a wave of creativity and new business models. Nicolas Rapp  The magic of the iPhone was putting “the power of a computer in one’s pocket” and then making it easy to use, says longtime analyst Toni Sacconaghi at Bernstein Research. With help from the iPhone, mobile messaging grew from a nerdy niche to a cultural phenomenon with WhatsApp and Snapchat. Social networks Twitter and Facebook gained big new markets. Games like Angry Birds minted money while ride-sharing app Uber burst onto the scene. During the iPhone’s early years, Apple ate the cell phone industry’s lunch. By the end of 2009, iPhones accounted for one of every seven smartphones sold worldwide, according to IDC. But as Apple lapped BlackBerry, Nokia, and Microsoft, Google started its own push into mobile phones that was inspired by the iPhone and introduced mobile operating system Android.

Unlike Apple, Google courted multiple phone carriers with promises of greater influence and more money. Google also worked with multiple hardware makers including Samsung, leading to better Android phones and a greater variety of designs. Nicolas Rapp  By 2010, more Android-based phones were being sold than those running the iPhone’s iOS system. Spurring further gains for Android, Apple didn’t quickly recognize the appeal of Samsung’s large-screen phones. By last year, the Google—supplied software powered more than five out of six smartphones. There were other hiccups for Apple, like “Antennagate” in 2010, when Jobs dismissed customer complaints about reception problems with the iPhone. But even with Android’s success, iPhone sales kept climbing. Apple sold almost twice as many iPhones in 2010 than in the year prior, doubled sales again in 2011, and kept growing an average of 25% annually to a peak of nearly 232 million in 2015. Nicolas Rapp  Still, more recently, the iPhone’s growth has stalled. Apple sold 215 million phones in 2016, its first annual decline, after making only minor tweaks over the previous two years. Sales have also been held back by Apple’s decision not to chase a crop of cheaper Chinese upstarts. The rumor mill is already churning about the next possible iPhone, a 10th-anniversary edition with a bigger, brighter edge-to-edge screen; glass casing; and wireless charging. Maybe it will be enough to put Jobs’ beloved phone back on top. Graphics Sources: Bloomberg; Strategy Analytics; Apple Filings A version of this article appears in the June 1, 2017 issue of Fortune.

The iPhone 7 really puts the first iPhones in perspective Dave Smith May 24, 2017, 11:52 AM 30,361 facebook linkedin twitter email print When I got into work this morning, there was a surprise sitting on my desk: The iPhone 3G, Apple's second-ever iPhone, and the first to support both 3G and GPS. Dave Smith/Business Insider Holding it in my hand, and comparing it to my current iPhone 7, really illustrates how much the iPhone has changed over the years — even though there's a great deal of consistency, too. View As: One Page Slides Just look at this thing. It is tiny! The original iPhone's display measured just three inches. Dave Smith/Business Insider I forgot how much I liked the glossy black back on the iPhone 3G. The very first iPhone had a mostly aluminum back, with black on the bottom third of the phone. Dave Smith/Business Insider Here's the iPhone 3G compared to an iPhone 6s owned by my coworker Tony Villas-Boas. Dave Smith/Business Insider The entirety of the iPhone 3G can comfortably sit within the perimeter of the iPhone 6s display — which is crazy. Keep in mind, Apple made these 3-inch iPhones for the first five generations of iPhone; the iPhone 5 in 2012 was the first with a 4-inch screen. Dave Smith/Business Insider Here's the iPhone 3G compared to my iPhone 7. Though the design is remarkably similar, you can really see how certain aspects have evolved: The physical home button is now a force-sensitive static "button" for Touch ID; the display has jumped from 3 inches to 5.5 inches; the speaker at the top is slightly larger on the iPhone 7; and the newer model features a front-facing camera. Dave Smith/Business Insider Here's the view from the bottom: The iPhone 3G had a single audio speaker at the bottom, whereas the iPhone 7 features a pair of very loud stereo speakers. Also note the port change: The original iPhones featured the 30-pin connector, which was replaced with the smaller and reversible Lightning connector for the iPhone 5 launch in 2012. Dave Smith/Business Insider And... what is that on the iPhone 3G? A headphone jack? Weird! And here's a view of the backs. The iPhone 3G's camera was a 2-megapixel shooter; it didn't have zoom, flash, autofocus, or even video support. The iPhone 7's 12-megapixel shooter supports 4K and a bevy of photo and video formats, and comes with a second telephoto lens for enhanced zooming. The older iPhone also has a rounded back and a more pronounced logo. Dave Smith/Business Insider This year is the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, and Apple is expected to launch an iPhone with a radical redesign, featuring a gorgeous OLED display that takes up most of the front of the phone and wireless charging, among other features. Looking at one of the first iPhones and comparing it to the current iPhones makes you realize that Apple's design sensibilities really haven't changed much over the last decade. Apple is still going for a slim, modern, rounded-rectangle design that looks like a flat slab of metal and glass. And based on the concepts and leaks we've seen thus far, we can expect the iPhone 8, or whatever Apple calls that phone, to look similar to these phones above: It will probably look similar to the iPhone 7 from the front, and perhaps the glass back will resemble the glossy back of the iPhone 3G. We'll expect to learn more soon, as Apple typically hosts its iPhone unveilings in September.

The post has since been taken down, but initially included the caption: “How did I end up in the studio with Dr Dre ON THE night his deal went public that he did with Apple 3.2 BILLION!!!!! The BEATS HEADPHONES JUST CHANGED HIP HOP!!!!!!” WATCH: The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Financial Times reported the story Thursday citing sources briefed on the talks. Beats by Dre headphones‘ annual sales revenues have reportedly gone up to $1.5 billion since the company was founded with music executive Jimmy Iovine began selling headphones in 2008. The deal would include the new Beats Music streaming service, which Apple is likely acquiring to compete with streaming services like Pandora and Spotify after the company’s iTunes Radio failed to impress the industry. Apple’s revenue growth has declined sharply in recent years, and the company only entered the broadly popular streaming market last year — late because of former CEO Steve Jobs’ reported unfavorable opinion of music subscription services. The company continues to be the largest seller of music downloads, but is losing market share to companies like Amazon. Purchasing Beats would mark Apple’s largest acquisition ever. The headphones retail between about $169.95 to $449.95, depending on model and features, and despite many music and sound industry experts describing their quality as “extraordinarily bad,” the brand has become enormously popular as a fashion item among a younger consumer base, and the popular alternative to standard earbuds models. Beats’ success is due in large part to its wide profit margins – despite the steep prices of the popular bass-heavy headphone models, each individual unit reportedly only costs around $14 to produce. Private equity firm Carlyle Group invested $500 million in Beats last year, and valued the company at more than $1 billion. Neither Apple nor Beats would comment on the deal in the original reports, and the briefed sources said they were still in the negotiation stage. Though the companies have yet to consummate the agreement, and it could still fall through, if things go as planned the official announcement could be made as early as next week.

The Surface Pro is exactly what Microsoft needs to boost sinking Surface sales Todd Haselton CNBC May 23, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share The Surface Pro is exactly what Microsoft needs to boost sinking Surface salesMore Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) announced its brand new Surface Pro laptop/tablet hybrid during a press conference in Shanghai on Tuesday. I had a chance to see the new Surface Pro in a meeting with Microsoft, and I think there's enough here to help the company boost its sinking Surface sales. A complete redesign, but a familiar look The new model has no number attached to it. Although it follows the Surface Pro 4, which was released in October 2015, it's just called "Surface Pro," rather than "Surface Pro 5." This suggests Microsoft is moving into a more regular cadence with the products, updating them regularly as Apple has done with its MacBook and iPad lines for some years now. It may also be trying to avoid confusion, as it now has several different products with the "Surface" brand attached to them, including two other laptops and a desktop. The new Surface Pro is a much more powerful machine with longer battery life -- Microsoft told me it should last up to 13.5 hours, or 50 percent more than the Surface Pro 4 -- and new features. It's equipped with Intel's latest seventh-generation Core processors, which offer more power and better battery life. These chips are not yet in Apple's MacBook or MacBook Pro, which are expected to get refreshed next month. That's a feather in Microsoft's cap. Unless you're buying the high-end model, you also won't find any fans, which means the machines are extremely quiet. Plenty of new features The kickstand, which sits flush with the device when not in use, now tilts down to a 165-degree angle, allowing the machine to be propped up on a desk for drawing with the Surface Pen. You can also use Microsoft's Surface Dial, first introduced with the Surface Studio desktop last year, which can be placed on the screen and used for anything from flipping through PowerPoint to zooming around 3D Maps and editing in Adobe Photoshop. The $99 Surface Pen, which is still bizarrely not included with the Surface Pro, is a must-have accessory. Microsoft doubled the levels of pressure supported by the device, which means you can draw and write more accurately, with penmanship that better reflects your handwriting. Users will also find much more accurate tilting and shading, allowing the pen to function like a real pencil in some applications. Unlike Apple, Microsoft kept a full-sized USB port on the side of the Surface Pro, which I appreciate. While I understand USB-C is the future, most people still own plenty of standard-sized USB gadgets, which means plugging in a keyboard or mouse will work without the need for an adapter. Microsoft's Surface Pro 4 keyboard was the first in the Surface series I could type on for extended periods of time. The new keyboard builds on that one with increased key travel for a more comfortable experience, though I did notice the keypad still has a bit of flex on it when I typed with force. The whole Surface Pro package is extremely familiar, despite these changes, which is a good strategy for Microsoft. I think people really enjoyed its previous Surface Pro 4 laptop, and believe sales slowed because consumers wanted something newer. A whole Surface family There's going to be some cannibalism going on within Microsoft's Surface family, however. When the firm introduced the Surface Pro 4, it didn't offer any other "Surface-branded" products. Now it has several, including the Surface Book, a high-end hybrid that competes most directly with Apple's MacBook Pro; the Surface Laptop, a lower-end laptop whose screen cannot be removed to use like a tablet; and the Surface Studio desktop. But I think most people should buy the Surface Pro. The Surface Laptop is targeted at the education sector and features a hobbled version of Windows 10 that will need to be upgraded by most users. The Surface Book is a fantastic machine and can be configured with a dedicated graphics chip for folks who need to edit videos or to play some light games. But it starts at $1499 -- almost double the price of the entry-level Surface Pro. Overall, the Surface Pro is the most versatile of the bunch and offers the best balance between price, portability and features. It's available for pre-order today starting at $799 (though the model we recommend you buy will set you back more than $1,500), and will start shipping on June 15.

LIKE   TWEET   SHARE   PIN   SHARE   POST MAIL MORE Posted 14 hours ago by iClarified · 1508 views · Translate Apple is reportedly planning a trial production run of Micro LED displays later this year, reports DigiTimes. A few makers engaged in R&D for micro LED display products, despite many technological bottlenecks, are expected to take the initiative to begin trial production in the second half of 2017 at the earliest, according to industry sources. Apple is said to have been 'keen' in the development of micro LED technology following the acquisition of LuxVue in 2014. The company is purportedly planning to make a small volume of micro LED display products from its plant in Taoyuan, northern Taiwan at the end of the year. Notably, Apple assembler Foxconn has recently announced plans to acquire eLux for US$27.03 million in cash. Sharp will invest US$7 million to take a 31.82% stake in eLux, while three other Foxconn subsidiaries CyberNet Venture Capital, panel maker Innolux and LED packaging service provider Advanced Optoelectronic Technology (AOT) will also take a 45.45%, 13.64% and 9.09% stake, respectively, in eLux. The acquisition could be a way for Foxconn to commercialize micro-LED technology for supply to Apple. Micro LED could first be used in the Apple Watch where they would replace OLED. mLED displays are easier to read than OLED displays in direct sunlight and they use significantly less energy than LCD.

The report comes CNBC with its sources stating that Cook was wearing the device at Apple's campus in Cupertino, California. Whilst details are currently scarce, it follows previous reports that indicate that Apple have a team in Palo Alto working on technology to benefit people with diabetes through non-invasive continuous glucose monitors (CGMs). In February, Cook had met with students at Glasgow University, stating: "I've been wearing a continuous glucose monitor for a few weeks, I just took it off before coming on this trip." CGMs are becoming more commonly used by people with type 1 diabetes and they are also attracting interest from people with type 2 diabetes. They are able to take thousands of glucose readings a day and continuous trend patterns without having to take multiple blood tests. Tim Cook acknowledged to the students that the devices could play a very useful part in preventing type 2 diabetes: "There is lots of hope out there that if someone has constant knowledge of what they're eating, they can instantly know what causes the response... and that they can adjust well before they become diabetic." One of the barriers to tech companies face is the fact that monitoring devices for diabetes need to pass through intense scrutiny from regulatory authorities such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US. This helps to ensure that devices are safe and fit for purpose, however, it slows down technological progress. By focusing the device on its use in people without diabetes, it would enable technology companies to develop their products without the risk of harm and without the regulatory hurdles to cross. If the products are successful, it could allow problems to be ironed out before they are submitted for FDA approval. For now, we will continue to watch this space for new developments in the world of the giant tech companies and diabetes.

Apps iPhone Apps iPad Apps Mac Apps Apple TV Apps Apple Watch Apps The Best Apps Tutorials Jailbreak Jailbreak Tweaks Jailbreak Guide Unlock Guide Deals Latest Deals Devices iPhone iPad Mac Apple Watch Apple TV More Download Wallpapers iPhone Photography Expert Tips Podcasts Apple granted patent for iPhone-compatible Apple Pencil Christian Zibreg on May 24, 2017 0 The United States Patent and Trademark Office yesterday awarded a new patent to Apple, seemingly covering a future Apple Pencil that would work with an iPhone. Apple’s $99 stylus is currently exclusive to iPad Pro models because the accessory requires a special system underneath the display, which iPhones currently don’t have. The U.S. Patent No. 9,658,704, titled “Devices and methods for manipulating user interfaces with a stylus”, describes a future Apple Pencil as supporting a myriad of electronic devices outfitted with a touchscreen and one or more sensors to detect signals from a stylus. In some embodiments, the patent describes using a stylus with portable communications devices like iPhone, iPod touch and iPad by taking advantage of the projected mutual capacitance sensing technology that Apple’s existing OS devices currently use. The wording of the patent indicates strongly that a future Apple Pencil may work with other types of apps like word processing, spreadsheet making, game playing, web browsing, image editing, email and more. Other devices like Macs with touch-sensitive trackpads might also work with a stylus. Both “iPhone” and “phone” are referenced many times throughout the patent application. One of the included patent drawings clearly illustrates a stylus being used with an iPhone-like device. The patent was originally filed for in September 2015 and credits Apple engineers Jeffrey Traer Bernstein, Linda L. Dong, Mark K. Hauenstein and Julian Missig as its inventors. Tim Cook may have hinted in an interview last September that Apple Pencil could soon work with iPhones, thereby suggesting that the next iPhone might incorporate additional sensor support for a next-generation digital stylus from Apple.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Don’t let that ugly iPhone 8 model scare you – this is what the real thing will look like Image Source: Benjamin Geskin Zach Epstein @zacharye May 24th, 2017 at 10:31 AM Share Tweet Apple’s upcoming next-generation iPhone 8 is now about four months away from being announced. As we’ve come to expect in light of all the leaks we’ve seen in previous years, Apple’s new iPhone becomes less mysterious with each passing day. Countless rumors and reports have been flooding the web for months now, and there are a number of things that are consistent across nearly all of them. We know the iPhone 8 will be far smaller than the iPhone 7 Plus, yet it will feature a larger display. We also know that display will be an OLED panel, and it’ll take up nearly all of the phone’s front side thanks to reengineered internal components and the removal of the physical home button. Last week, we gave the world its first real-word look at what sources say is Apple’s final iPhone 8 design. Then, just this morning, a similar iPhone 8 3D model was shown on video for the first time. People seem to be a bit concerned that these mockups are a bit ugly, but we’re about to show you why you really shouldn’t be worried. Don't Miss: Forget the NES Classic Edition, this $40 console can play every NES game ever Apple’s iPhone designs have changed a great deal over the years, but there’s one thing that has remained consistent: the iPhone is always a stunning device. Even now, with an iPhone design that is three years old, the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are still among the sleekest phones available. In fact, last year Google and HTC still loved Apple’s old iPhone design so much that they decided to replicate it on the Pixel and Pixel XL. In 2017, Apple’s flagship iPhone 8 will get a top-to-bottom design makeover. The front and back will be made of rounded glass while polished stainless steel is expected to surround the perimeter. We’ve seen this rumored design mocked up, but initial mockups never seem to properly capture the refinement of real iPhones. For that, we turn to Instagram user “appleidesigner,” whose recent iPhone 8 renders were emailed to us by a reader on Wednesday morning. In the images posted by appleidesigner, we see a sleek and smooth iPhone 8 that for the most part aligns with the dummies we’ve seen — but these new renders show the fit and finish of an actual Apple product. See for yourself in the images below. Apple’s iPhone 8 is expected to be unveiled in September alongside new iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus models.

By Kiko Antonio https://twitter.com/kikoTBB on May 24, 2017 11:38 PM At the moment, consumers and fans alike are still knee deep in rumors pertaining to the iPhone 8. That is why it is quite surprising if we start to hear news about the next phone in line from Apple. However, The Investor clearly believes otherwise. In fact, it just reported that Apple has agreed with Samsung for the supply of OLED displays for the iPhone 9. As sketchy as it may sound, the report claims that Samsung will be supplying all the OLED displays for next year’s iPhone devices. On top of that, it seems like the phone will both get size increases as the reported displays are bigger than current iPhone devices. In the said report, the regular iPhone 9 will have a 5.28-inch OLED panel. Meanwhile, the iPhone 9 Plus is to carry a much bigger 6.46-inch OLED display. Perhaps it will sound crazy but it seems like Apple is jumping onto the big-screen hype train. Samsung is said to ship around 180 million displays for next year’s iPhone. Alleged iPhone mock up sample (by Benjamin Geskin) Right now, many Apple fans are still waiting for news about the iPhone 8. The phone is said to introduce a plethora of technological improvements including augmented reality and 3D facial recognition. There are numerous reports suggesting that Apple might delay the release of the iPhone 8 due to manufacturing issues. However, it seems like all of that has been sorted out. New reports claim that production will start very soon and that it is still set for a September unveiling with the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus. It is more than likely that, even though it will be more expensive, more consumers will opt for the said phone. It will be quite interesting how the phone will perform in the market knowing that other phone makers like Samsung are also trying to come up with phones to match the iPhone 8.

Geely agreed on Wednesday to buy 49.9 per cent of Malaysian car maker Proton and with that deal comes a controlling 51 per cent stake in Norwich-based Lotus. Lotus made a £26.7m loss in the last financial year, the latest in a series of annual losses, as sales slumped by 242 cars to 1,584. Chief executive Jean-Marc Gales has been trying to turn around the company’s financial performance, helped by the popular Evora 400 model. Read more Lotus Elise Cup 250 arriving in April Lotus also runs an engineering consultancy selling sports car technology though it has not been involved in Formula 1 since the 1990s. The stake in Proton will give Geely greater access to the Southeast Asian market, where non-Japanese brands have struggled. It also gives Geely a stronger foothold in right-hand drive markets including the UK, India and Australia.

Founded in 1986 as a refrigerator manufacturer, it began making motorbikes in the 1990s and launched its first car in 2002. It bought Volvo from Ford in 2010 and the London Taxi Company, acquired in 2013. The copmpany says it aims to produce three million cars across all of its operations by 2020. "With Proton and Lotus joining the Geely Group portfolio of brands we strengthen our global footprint and develop a beachhead in Southeast Asia," said Geely executive vice president Daniel Li Donghui.

Reuters 2/29 Apple named world’s most value company in tech-dominated Forbes ranking - Tuesday 23 May Tech behemoth Apple has been named the most valuable brand in the world for a seventh consecutive year. The highly-regarded ranking, compiled by Forbes magazine, puts the iPhone makers’ brand value at $170bn, a 10 per cent increase on figure for 2016 and well ahead of second-placed Google, whose brand value has risen $19.3bn from last year to just under $102bn, according to Forbes. Tech peer Microsoft nabbed third spot, with a value of $87bn, followed by Facebook at $73.5bn. Consumer goods giant Coca-Cola rounds out the top five with a value of $56.4bn. Reuters 3/29 Diamond ring bought for £10 at car boot sale expected to fetch £350,000 at auction - Monday 22 May A large, diamond ring is expected to fetch £350,000 at auction 30 years after its owner paid £10 for it at a car boot sale, thinking it was a costume jewel. The “exceptionally-sized” stone was presumed not to be real because 19th Century diamonds were not cut to show off their brilliance like today's gems. And so the owner, unaware of its value, wore it for decades, while doing everything from the shopping to the chores.

Commission chief executive, Rebecca Hilsenrath, said: “We have asked the court if it agrees with us that Mr Wilson’s lettings policy contains unlawful criteria and, if so, to issue an injunction. “As this is now formal legal action we will release further information at a later date.” Gareth Fuller/PA 7/29 Nestlé foiled by Cadbury as it loses bid to trademark KitKat bar - Wednesday 17 May KitKat-maker Nestlé has been foiled again, after a UK Court of Appeal ruled that the consumer goods giant cannot trademark the shape of its popular four-fingered chocolate bar. The ruling is the latest in a long running legal battle between the Swiss-based company and its rival Cadbury. Nestlé argues that the KitKat’s shape is “iconic” and should be protected by law but Cadbury objects. On Wednesday, the Court of Appeal ruled in favour of Cadbury, dismissing the claim. iStock 8/29 Yorkshire is the best region in the UK for workplace happiness - Tuesday 16 May The best region in Britain for workplace happiness and satisfaction is Yorkshire and the Humber, according to new research.

The findings may give pause for thought to many workers in the capital putting up with sky-high property prices in the hope of landing their dream job. 9/29 Andy Murray funds company behind world's first foldable bike helmet - Monday May 15 He may be almost unbeatable on the tennis court, but how will Andy Murray fare in the world of investing?

The supermarket said on Friday that it would start selling the misshapen and superficially blemished fruits for 39p each or £2.40 a kilogramme in the majority of its stores across the UK starting from 15 May until the end of the summer. Morrisons claims that its offer is the cheapest on the UK market and compares to an average retail price of £1.05 apiece, which is up from 98p last year.

The company sells billions of products in single-use sachets each year, including cosmetics and food products, particularly in developing and emerging markets.

Ellen McGirt May 24, 2017 Short up top today because I’m on the move, but as always, doing the work. The good people at Great Places To Work have asked me to moderate an all-star panel at their Great Places to Work For ALL conference, which continues today and tomorrow. The team behind the 100 Best Companies to Work For list on Fortune is evolving their thinking about what it means to build an inclusive workplace filled with engaged employees, so expect the conversations to be lively. (The addition of “For ALL” is a pretty big hint of what’s to come, so do tune in if you can.) Our panel, Navigating the Complexities of "4ALL" in a Global Business will speak to the challenges of inclusion, while offering important tips for what works well and how to push past resistance in your own organizations. Leading the way will be: Corey Anthony, Senior Vice President - Human Resources & Chief Diversity Officer, AT&T Beth A. Brooke-Marciniak, Global Vice Chair - Public Policy, EY Francine Katsoudas, Senior Vice President and Chief People Officer, Cisco Nancy Vitale, Senior Vice President of Human Resources, Genentech We go on at 4:30pm today Central time, but the entire day should be right up your ally alley. If there's anything you want me to ask the esteemed panelists, hit me up on Twitter, then watch the live-stream here, or follow the hashtag #GPTW4ALL for all the action. On Point Taiwan takes an important step toward allowing same-sex marriage Today, Taiwan’s Constitutional Court ruled in favor of same-sex marriage, making it the first country in Asia to do so. “The result of the constitutional ruling is not a victory or a defeat, no matter what attitude one holds on the same-sex marriage issue, this is the time when we look at all people around us as our own brothers and sisters,” Taiwan president Tsai Ing-wen wrote on Facebook. The government will be drawing up a related proposal for legislative review, but didn’t specify how they would enact the change. Proponents want existing marriage laws amended to include same-sex couples. Taiwan News The FADER's special issue on immigration reminds us that we're all from somewhere The May/June issue of the FADER hit newsstands yesterday. The Diaspora Issue is devoted to the unique lives of immigrants and their new communities, the perils of border crossings and how music plays an indispensable role in soothing tensions and re-connecting people with their cultures. There are four separate cover stories, all worth your time. I’d start with the story of Romeo Santos, one of the most influential Latin pop stars around, from the Bronx by way of the Dominican Republic. The bachata heartthrob has also become a brand whisperer, teaching Audi, Macy’s, PepsiCo among others, better ways to sell products to Latinx audiences around the world. The FADER Apple watchers hope that a new diversity position will herald a new era of inclusion at the company Denise Young Smith, Apple’s former global head of human resources and a twenty-year veteran of the company, has been tapped for a newly created vice president position in charge of diversity and inclusion. She will be reporting directly to Apple’s CEO, Tim Cook. Diversity watchers may remember that the last D&I professional at Apple was Jeffery Siminoff, who left the company in late 2015 to join Twitter. Where Siminoff, a director, reported to Smith, her elevated corporate status means more access to C-Suite thinking. Sources tell Techcrunch that this is a “significant upscaling of responsibility,” and are hopeful that “Denise’s years of experience, expertise and passion will help us make an even greater impact in this area.” Tech Crunch If you live in safe and affordable housing, you will be healthier and live longer In the East Harlem neighborhood where Dr. Prabhjot Singh works, he asks his patients some surprising diagnostic questions: “Where do you live?” “Do you think you are at risk of becoming homeless?” “How often in the past 12 months were you worried or stressed about having enough money to pay your rent or mortgage?” He’s learned that people with insecure housing are often sickened by the substandard conditions, or too worried about their lives to take care of their health. As their health deteriorates, their cost of care skyrockets. A doctor at the helm of HUD should be able to better understand the intersection of health and home, he suggests. To that end, he offers a laundry list of suggestions for better policies that will provide true safety nets for the working poor. Here are two: better utilize health impact assessments and “give states more flexibility to use Medicaid funds together with non-healthcare spending,” he says. Politico A new black ‘Bachelorette’ dredges up the same old race problems I stopped tuning into these shows ages ago, but this chatty watch-along-with-us from Amanda Hess, Jon Caramanica, and Jenna Wortham makes me think that this version will be a constant series of cringe-inducing object lessons on race. Rachel Lindsay is the latest bachelorette, looking for love among a diverse scrum of attention-seeking competitors. And she’s black. “I’m not expecting ABC executives to know how to handle the racial dynamics of this show,” declares Wortham. “But the moments when the racial dynamics do leak through are fascinating.” And freakishly awkward. “When Dean infamously told Rachel in “After the Final Rose” that he was ready to “go black” and “never go back” — and then licked his lips and stared at her with all the confidence of a mediocre white man — I naïvely hoped that he would be set up as a heel instead of a true romantic prospect,” said Hess. But then they made sandcastles? New York Times The Woke Leader The long-term ill effects of European beauty ideals on black and brown women Speaking of ‘The Bachelorette’, it’s worth remembering that ideas about beauty, which have long been derived from European standards of light skin, certain body types and hair, have measurably negative effects on the lives of black women, particularly those with darker skin tones. The impacts on their self-esteem, earning power, academic lives, career paths, and marriage prospects are painful and can be permanent. “As a result, the internalization of racialized beauty standards can perpetuate into a lifelong, intergenerational culture of self-hatred,” explains Susan L. Bryant in the Columbia Social Work Review. This article is geared toward social work practitioners but makes important reading for anyone designing inclusive programs. It will also help explain why cultural movements like #BlackGirlMagic really are so vital. New York Times Why Jane Austen appeals to white supremacists Editors Ayesha Mattu & Nura Maznavi slice into to the popularity of Jane Austen among avowed white supremacists. This should surprise no one, they say. White supremacist thinking is an integral part of the way modern entertainment operates. “The truth is, the white power structure that created the conditions that brought Trump into power includes Hollywood, the Literary Establishment, the media, and academia, as well as the liberals and conservatives who were shaped by these institutions.” Important things get lost in translation. “Jane Austen …wrote candidly and bitingly about reputation and social standing; women’s issues related to sex, power, and wealth; and familial and marital relationships,” they say. By diluting Austen into light romantic fare, we miss the broader implications of her work and the impact on her fans. “At the heart of these adaptations — and their inability to capture the ways that Austen’s writings could easily reflect the lived reality of a diverse spectrum of modern Austen fans — lies a failure of the white imagination.” The Establishment A map that shows where it is illegal to be gay There are some 75 countries in the world where same-sex relationships are punishable by fines, prison or death; even more where same-sex “propaganda” or discussion is banned. Today, some 40% of the world lives in places where the LGBT community faces state-sanctioned harassment, and some 400 million live in a place where LGBT people are subject to execution. More than 60 countries now legally protect LGBT people at work and 15 recognize same-sex marriage. (You can fill in Taiwan with a Sharpie if they haven’t gotten around to updating the map yet.)

I was a long-time Fitbit user (Flex, Alta). I am also very active. My main sports are yoga and trail running but I also do a lot of things like hiking, paddling, occasional weight lifting/kettlebells and just general active outdoor fitness stuff. I also teach yoga and stand-up paddleboarding. I've been using a Garmin to track my running for years and a basic heart rate monitor to track non-GPS exercises, while also wearing my Fitbit. I disliked wearing two devices and I'd been wanting an Apple Watch since they first came out, so when the Sport 2 was released I decided to finally buy one (alumnimum model) and retire my Alta. That was March 18. Since then I've been wearing the Apple Watch daily, and I like it a lot. I love the functional stuff like text notifications, Dark Sky weather, being able to control my music when I'm teaching and running. I LOVE the way it looks — so sleek compared to the Fitbit. I still prefe my Garmin but I like that I can use Strava in the event my Garmin battery is dead. There are some flaws though. Fitbit's fitness tracking app is so well-designed and intuitive, with all the tracking information in one place. I am annoyed that I have to use a third-party app to track sleep with the Apple Watch. I hate that I can't export exercises out of the Activities app. In general, fitness tracking on the Watch seems like an after thought behind all the "techy" things it can do. But my biggest problem with the Watch is that I am TERRIFIED, absolutely terrified of fucking it up. The Sport version is water resistant and supposedly has a stronger screen, but in the two months I've had it I've already scratched the screen pretty significantly by — get this — pulling clothes out of my washing machine. I am worried the watch is going to fall off while I'm paddleboarding and sink to the bottom of the lake and I'll never see it again. I am worried the scratched and bumo of wearing it every day are going to compromise it's waterproofing. I am about to go on a 10-day sailing trip and am freaking out about the idea of exposing it to salt water, even though Apple says that should be okay. My old Alta screen is scratched to hell from playing with kettlebells, but I didn't really care because it was like $120, not $400. I do have AppleCare+ but I'd still have to pay to replace the screen. I've thought about buying screen protectors but I've read they kinda suck for the watch. Protective cases look dorky but I might be convinced to wear one for, say, my sailing trip (not for every day). Apple Watch owners, how do you cope with this? How has your watch held up to wear and tear? What add-ons can I get to protect it without turning it from a sleek-looking device into a bulky rubber fitness watch? What other advice do you have for super-active Apple Watch users? posted by Brittanie to Technology (10 answers total) 1 user marked this as a favorite   I am not an Apple Watch owner, but point of information: The aluminum case models use what Apple is calling "Ion-X" glass, which is similar to the material that is used on most smartphone displays. It is shatter-resistant, but can be vulnerable to scratches (this trade-off makes sense with something like the surface area of a phone screen). The stainless steel Apple Watch models use "sapphire" glass, which is basically the same material that probably covers the camera lens on your phone. It's relatively more scratch resistant, and less shatter resistant. Again, a reasonable trade-off given the surface area and function of a camera lens. TLDR: If you are someone who uses a screen protector for your phone, it may make sense to use one for the watch. posted by AndrewInDC at 9:37 AM on May 24 [1 favorite] People in the (non-smart) watch collecting community console each other about new scratches by encouraging each other to be zen about it. I think a well worn watch, like any well worn tool, can be quite beautiful. What I love about watches is that over time they become reflections of their owners. Maybe yours starts out as jewelry but becomes a tool that reminds you of all the adventures you've had. posted by danny the boy at 11:01 AM on May 24 [6 favorites] I have a simple adhesive screen cover that I'm pretty happy with. (Mine only covers the flat part though, not the contoured edges.) For a while, I used something like this dorky bumper, which worked well (but again, pretty dorky). If you don't mind switching it out as need dictates, I'd still recommend it. posted by supercres at 11:09 AM on May 24 I had my watch for an hour and took a shower. Forgot it take it off of course. Was fine. I watched a YouTube video when it came out - they boiled it in water, submerged it for an hour, took a knife to it. All fine. It got a little messed up - still worked! - after bashing it repeatedly with a cast iron skillet. They did everything they could think of to destroy it. Don't do any of these things. Only because it would be stupid - but the watch will still work. posted by crankyrogalsky at 12:03 PM on May 24 I wear one every day since they launched and have not taken any special care with it other than not submerging it, and I may have a couple scratches here or there but it's held up great. I think the best thing to do is wear it as-is, accept the wear as the patina of use, and put back a little money every month into a peace-of-mind fund so that if version 3 comes out and has some new killer app that you can't live without, you can upgrade then. They are fundamentally quite tough. posted by oblique red at 12:05 PM on May 24 [3 favorites] How long, realistically, will you want to own this watch? Three years? Five at the very most? By that point, you will be bored with it, something new will be out, and you will want that new thing and care not a whit for the scratches. Fundamentally, your active lifestyle is not compatible with delicate and precious things: but you bought this because of your lifestyle, not because you love delicate and precious things. So take basic precautions, but don't restrict your lifestyle to keep a little museum on your wrist. Put $20 every month into your Gadget Upgrade Fund, consider that your insurance, and get on with the outdoor fun. posted by epanalepsis at 12:20 PM on May 24 [5 favorites] I purchased the Series 1 aluminum Apple Watch soon after it came out. I've worn it just about everyday since then. I bicycle everyday and am generally active. I had the typical first few days of being hyper-aware of wearing an expensive (to me) watch, but quickly settled down into not really thinking about it. After all this time/use, the watch looks practically new. A couple of tiny screen scratches. No scratches on the casing. No effects from major sweating. Even though the Series 1 is less water-resistant than the current version I've had no issues arise from biking with it in pouring rain or from snow/ice. I've dropped it a few times and slammed my wrist into a couple of things without any damaging effects. I've never even remotely felt like the watch will fall off. There is no evidence of wear on the bands or around the holes in the band. The inside can get a bit grimy, but a quick wipe with a damp cloth takes care of it. If you got a major scratch from using a washing machine, maybe you want to bring it in and see if the screen is somehow defective (assuming you didn't run it across a sharp exposed metal edge). Otherwise, since you have AppleCare, don't worry about scratches and just before AppleCare expires assess whether you want to pay the relatively low fee for a new screen that will then last you a couple of more years, easily. By that time you might decide to get a new watch/device instead, or decide your screen is still in good enough shape. This is speaking as someone who wouldn't mind some of the features of a Series 2 Watch but absolutely cannot justify purchasing one with a problem-free new-looking watch already on my wrist! posted by mikepop at 12:38 PM on May 24 [1 favorite] Just wanted to add that the nylon bands can get quite dirty from a lot of sweat/activity. I was able to clean mine up with some soap and water and a sponge but now use that band just for "dressing up" and otherwise use the standard band. posted by mikepop at 12:42 PM on May 24 I have been wearing the Apple Watch Series 0 in dark gray (space gray?) every single day since release day. Looking at it carefully - it has a tiny scratch under the face, a couple of hairline scratches on the glass, and is otherwise fine. I've worn it non-stop, mostly with the black sport band ("fluoroelastomer", said Jony) although I also have a sparingly-used gray/black nylon band. It's pretty tough - I've taken no special precautions, although I'll probably upgrade in a year or two because it is fundamentally disposable, unlike the two mechanical watches I've owned. So: > the best thing to do is wear it as-is, accept the wear as the patina of use and > you bought this because of your lifestyle, not because you love delicate and precious things. So take basic precautions, but don't restrict your lifestyle to keep a little museum on your wrist. posted by RedOrGreen at 2:00 PM on May 24 [1 favorite] I've got the cheapest Series 2 and have hit all sorts of things with it and each time found no sign of damage, much to my surprise. I clean it by rinsing it under the tap. No problems so far (I've had it since November). posted by BinaryApe at 11:00 PM on May 24 « Older New Hampshire: the next level   |   Academic/Historian Filter: How did we stop seeing...

But it's still a business  James Moore Chief Business Commentator @JimMooreJourno Wednesday 24 May 2017 16:56 BST Click to follow The Independent Online uSwitch: Its ads are hard to miss “The consumer champion at the heart of your home,” is how ZPG, formerly known as Zoopla, leads off its annual report. Right.   The group owns a portfolio of websites which are mostly focussed on property. Also among their number, however, is uSwitch, the price comparison website.  If you haven’t seen one of its ubiquitous ads by now, where have you been?  Read more Zoopla boss hits out at buy-to-let tax hike Zoopla chief executive Alex Chesterman in line for £19m bonus Zoopla agrees to buy uSwitch for £190m They’re not as good as MoneySuperMarket’s but they’re certainly irritating enough to get noticed. And they have been doing very well for the group, which has just reported a 22 per cent rise in revenues and an 11 per cent rise in adjusted earnings on the back of record traffic (more than 314m visits of which a shade over two thirds came via mobile).  Headline pre tax profits were hit by acquisition costs (the company’s been on a bit of a spree) and other one offs, but the long term outlook is just dandy.  More and more people seem alive to what Zoopla’s businesses can do for them, and that’s a good thing, particularly when it comes to uSwitch. Far too few of us do switch.  It’s for that reason that politicians have been debating price caps on the big six energy providers, which have been busily boosting prices while continuing to provide a less than stellar service.  The only way to improve the often shabby treatment we get from the providers of vital services is to ditch them when they shaft us. uSwitch makes that easier, so more power to it and ZPG.  The Zoopla site, meanwhile, provides a handy tool for those searching to either buy or rent property, and for doing some of the homework on what they find that they need to do.  Great tools, both of them. The other sites among the portfolio also have value.   But let’s get real. Zoopla is not a consumer champion. It is a business that pays its executives handsomely, and is focussed on providing a return for shareholders.  Business picture of the day 29 show all Business picture of the day 1/29 Marks and Spencer reports slump in profit hurt by clothing sales and cost of new food stores - Wednesday 24 May High street stalwart Marks and Spencer has reported a more than 60 per cent fall in pre-tax profit in the year to the end of March, hurt by a decline in clothing sales and higher costs from opening new food stores. Pre-tax profit came in at £176.4m for the year, while sales were broadly steady at £10.6bn. Food revenue was up 4.2 per cent. Reuters 2/29 Apple named world’s most value company in tech-dominated Forbes ranking - Tuesday 23 May Tech behemoth Apple has been named the most valuable brand in the world for a seventh consecutive year. The highly-regarded ranking, compiled by Forbes magazine, puts the iPhone makers’ brand value at $170bn, a 10 per cent increase on figure for 2016 and well ahead of second-placed Google, whose brand value has risen $19.3bn from last year to just under $102bn, according to Forbes. Tech peer Microsoft nabbed third spot, with a value of $87bn, followed by Facebook at $73.5bn. Consumer goods giant Coca-Cola rounds out the top five with a value of $56.4bn.

The “exceptionally-sized” stone was presumed not to be real because 19th Century diamonds were not cut to show off their brilliance like today's gems. And so the owner, unaware of its value, wore it for decades, while doing everything from the shopping to the chores.

According to a supply chain report Wednesday from Taiwanese trade publication DigiTimes, the Cupertino giant is likely to crank out a small volume of micro-LED display products from its plant in Taoyuan, northern Taiwan at the end of the year. Other companies are looking to commercialize micro-LEDs, too. Samsung-owned PlayNitride should install a production line for micro-LEDs in the second half of 2017, which will use a mass-transfer process that mounts micro-LED chips on thin film transistor substrates. Micro-LED are so small that a five-inch 400-by-600 pixel smartphone panel requires nearly one million and a 4K TV panel about 50 million tiny chips. PlayNitride doesn’t expect first micro-LED-based mobile products to appear before 2019. Taiwan’s Industrial Technology Research Institute is expected to tie up with local businesses to begin trial production of micro-LEDs in 2018, using its in-house developed technology. Let’s not forget Apple’s contract manufacturer Foxconn, which recently announced plans plans to acquire display startup eLux for the development of next-generation micro-LEDs. Apple itself acquired micro-LED specialists LuxVue three years ago. Business Korea claimed last month that Apple Watch Series 3 is likely to use a micro-LED display before the technology proves feasible enough to be deployed on a mass-scale across Apple’s iPhone, iPad and Mac devices. Samsung Display and LG Display, which currently supply LCD screens for Apple devices, could lose around $1 billion per year should the iPhone maker adopt micro-LEDs. As we explained before, micro-LEDs could pave the way for Apple devices with longer-lasting batteries and brighter screens. As you know, traditional LCD-based screens waste a lot of energy because they require a backlight. In addition to boosting battery life by as much as 300 percent versus LCDs, micro-LEDs allow for higher-resolution screens with improved color gamut and two to three times the brightness of OLED technology under the same power consumption.

As we’ve come to expect in light of all the leaks we’ve seen in previous years, Apple’s new iPhone becomes less mysterious with each passing day. Countless rumors and reports have been flooding the web for months now, and there are a number of things that are consistent across nearly all of them. We know the iPhone 8 will be far smaller than the iPhone 7 Plus, yet it will feature a larger display. We also know that display will be an OLED panel, and it’ll take up nearly all of the phone’s front side thanks to reengineered internal components and the removal of the physical home button. Last week, we gave the world its first real-word look at what sources say is Apple’s final iPhone 8 design. Then, just this morning, a similar iPhone 8 3D model was shown on video for the first time. People seem to be a bit concerned that these mockups are a bit ugly, but we’re about to show you why you really shouldn’t be worried.   Don't Miss: Forget the NES Classic Edition, this $40 console can play every NES game ever Apple’s iPhone designs have changed a great deal over the years, but there’s one thing that has remained consistent: the iPhone is always a stunning device. Even now, with an iPhone design that is three years old, the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are still among the sleekest phones available. In fact, last year Google and HTC still loved Apple’s old iPhone design so much that they decided to replicate it on the Pixel and Pixel XL. In 2017, Apple’s flagship iPhone 8 will get a top-to-bottom design makeover. The front and back will be made of rounded glass while polished stainless steel is expected to surround the perimeter. We’ve seen this rumored design mocked up, but initial mockups never seem to properly capture the refinement of real iPhones. For that, we turn to Instagram user “appleidesigner,” whose recent iPhone 8 renders were emailed to us by a reader on Wednesday morning. In the images posted by appleidesigner, we see a sleek and smooth iPhone 8 that for the most part aligns with the dummies we’ve seen — but these new renders show the fit and finish of an actual Apple product. See for yourself in the images below. Read More Apple’s iPhone 8 is expected to be unveiled in September alongside new iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus models.

The application for an experimental license for the new technology was filed by Apple and made public by the FCC earlier this week, and states in part that, “Apple Inc. seeks to assess cellular link performance in direct path and multipath environments between base station transmitters and receivers using this spectrum,” and that “These assessments will provide engineering data relevant to the operation of devices on wireless carriers’ future 5G networks.” The application outlines Apple’s plans to test the technologies at two locations in Cupertino and Milpitas, California, transmitting from two fixed points at Apple facilities at these sites. While it’s not entirely clear what Apple’s goals are for this testing, the technology has the potential to significantly increase the speed and bandwidth of iPhone cellular connections, however the 28GHz band that Apple intends to test has also been allocated for earth-to-space transmissions, suggesting a possible connection to Apple’s rumoured move into satellite communications research.

The free-to-download course, which is an extension of Apple’s existing Everyone Can Code curriculum for kids in grades K-12, teaches students how to build fully-functional apps using the Swift programming language. In the fall, six community college systems that serve over 500,000 students will offer the new course. Tim Cook explained why Apple has created the development course: “We’ve seen firsthand the impact that coding has on individuals and the US economy as a whole. The app economy and software development are among the fastest-growing job sectors in America and we’re thrilled to be providing educators and students with the tools to learn coding,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “Community colleges play a critical role in helping students achieve their dreams, and we hope these courses will open doors for people of all ages and backgrounds to pursue what they love.” Swift Playgrounds has proven to be a powerful teaching tool with over 1 million downloads since it was introduced. In addition, over 1,000 schools in the US plan to teach using Apple’s Everyone Can Code materials in the fall. The extension of Everyone Can Code to older students should make the entire program even more attractive to educators than before.

The curriculum is available as a free download today from Apple’s iBooks Store. App Development with Swift is a full-year course designed by Apple engineers and educators to teach students elements of app design using Swift, one of the world’s most popular programming languages. Students will learn to code and design fully functional apps, gaining critical job skills in software development and information technology. Like with other recent moves, Apple has used this to highlight its impact on the American economy: “We’ve seen firsthand the impact that coding has on individuals and the US economy as a whole. The app economy and software development are among the fastest-growing job sectors in America and we’re thrilled to be providing educators and students with the tools to learn coding,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “Community colleges play a critical role in helping students achieve their dreams, and we hope these courses will open doors for people of all ages and backgrounds to pursue what they love.” Since its introduction, Swift Playgrounds has been downloaded one million times.

Facebook Twitter Google + Email Print Tech giants to press digital trade agenda By Li Zhou 05/24/2017 10:02 AM EDT With help from Doug Palmer, Margaret Harding McGill, Bryan Bender, Nancy Scola and Ashley Gold TECH GIANTS TO PRESS DIGITAL TRADE AGENDA — Executives from Apple, Microsoft, IBM and other tech giants are in Washington today to press members of Congress for strong outcomes on digital trade in new agreements negotiated by the Trump administration. “NAFTA is the place to start,” said Victoria Espinel, president of BSA | The Software Alliance, the group organizing today’s fly-in. “These improvements are critical for the modern economy. NAFTA is an opportunity to create a trade agenda for the future.” Story Continued Below — President Donald Trump walked away from a digital trade pact with Mexico, Canada and nine other countries when he abandoned the Trans-Pacific Partnership pact. Now, his administration cites the lack of digital trade provisions in NAFTA as one reason the 23-year-old agreement badly needs an update. BSA’s digital trade agenda seeks a provision guaranteeing the free movement of data across borders and a related requirement that governments cannot use data localization requirements as market access barriers. — Attendees include: CA Technologies’ Michael Bisignano, IBM’s Daniela Combe, Oracle’s Dorian Daley, Adobe’s Michael Dillon, Autodesk’s Pascal Di Fronzo, Apple’s Bruce Sewell, Microsoft’s Brad Smith, Trend Micro’s Felix Sterling, and Symantec’s Scott Taylor. The group will meet with Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.); Senate Commerce Chairman John Thune (R-S.D.); House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.); Sens. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Mike Lee (R-Utah); members of the House Judiciary Committee; and the two co-chairs of the Digital Trade Caucus, Reps. Suzan DelBene (D-Wash.) and Erik Paulsen (R-Minn.). IA RAISES ALARM ON PRIVACY BILL — The trade group representing Google, Facebook and Amazon is not pleased with a bill that would curtail targeted advertising by forcing tech companies to obtain opt-in consent from consumers before sharing web browsing history. “We, along with a broad swath of the American economy, are aware of the BROWSER Act and are tracking the proposal,” Internet Association spokesman Noah Theran said in a statement. “This bill has the potential to upend the consumer experience online and stifle innovation. Policymakers must recognize that websites and apps continue to be under strict FTC privacy enforcement and are not in an enforcement gap, unlike other stakeholders in the ecosystem.” —House telecom subcommittee Chairman Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) introduced the bill last week, saying it would bring all entities — including ISPs and internet firms — that collect and sell personal data under the same set of rules. But activist group Fight for the Future, which targeted Blackburn with billboards after she led the House charge to jettison the FCC’s broadband privacy rules this year, said the new measure appears geared at appeasing constituents who are angry over her vote on the privacy rules. “We’re waiting for some sign that the bill’s sponsors are actually serious about passing it before we comment on the content, since we’re skeptical this is anything more than an attempt to deflect criticism for their previous vote — which was extremely unpopular with the public,” said group co-founder Holmes Wilson. — One of the big questions is whether any senator takes up the privacy bill in the upper chamber. An aide to Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) told MT his office is “interested in the idea and are exploring our options.” Rep. Mike Doyle (D-Penn.), ranking Democrat on the House telecom subcommittee, said he hasn’t read the Blackburn measure yet.

DATA ACCESS HEARING TODAY — Law enforcement access to data stored overseas, a hot issue for the tech industry, is the subject of a Senate crime and terrorism subcommittee hearing this afternoon. “Cloud computing has subjected law enforcement and tech companies to confusing and outdated legal requirements. It is now time for Congress to act to solve the problem,” said Kevin Bishop, a spokesman for subcommittee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). Microsoft President Brad Smith is among those slated to testify. —Another topic for the hearing: the Trump administration’s push for a data sharing agreement between the U.S. and UK that would permit their law enforcement agencies to more swiftly access the data of one of their citizens held on computer servers located in the other country. Tom Bossert, Trump’s homeland security adviser, tells POLITICO the so-called U.S.-UK Sharing Agreement is “landmark in recognizing the 21st century digital landscape we are facing.” —The full Senate Judiciary Committee will also hold a confirmation hearing for intellectual property enforcement coordinator nominee Vishal Amin. Amin has worked as a senior counsel of the House Judiciary committee and helped to develop the USPTO’s Patent Trial and Appeal Board. The IP czar role has been an important one; Victoria Espinel — now head of BSA — held the position during the Obama administration and dealt with high-profile issues like anti-piracy, copyright enforcement and trade secret theft. HURD: MILES TO GO FOR MODERNIZATION FUND — Buried in the president's budget is a full-throated vote of confidence for the Modernizing Government Technology Act, the Rep. Will Hurd-championed bill that passed the House last week. The proposal would create a GSA-managed fund from which federal agencies could borrow to pay for upgrading "legacy" (polite talk for, "holy heck, that's thing's old and held together with duct tape and positive thinking") IT systems. The Trump budget assigns $228 million to fill the fund, and optimistically describes the MGT Act as "moving in parallel" with the president's budget plan. First things first, Hurd, tells MT, he's "grateful for the widespread recognition" the U.S. needs its technology to be of this century. "But like all President’s budgets, there are still many steps to go before this funding becomes a reality," says the Texas Republican. For one thing, all White House budgets are aspirational. For another thing, some on the Senate side are still balking at MGT, in part over worries the stand-alone agency capital funds it would also create can get out of hand. Adds Hurd, "I am cautiously optimistic that Congress will continue to prioritize the safety and security of our digital information and infrastructure, and am committed to championing the initiative throughout the budget and appropriations process.” SETH MOULTON'S DIGITAL DASHBOARD — Speaking of Hurd, at an event last week the congressman raved about the electronic display up in colleague Rep. Seth Moulton's office, part of the Massachusetts Democrat's bid to center his operation around "data-driven decision-making." Said Hurd, "When I walked into his office for the first time and I saw the thing, I was like, 'Where do I get one?' It's pretty cool." Intrigued, MT went to Moulton's fourth-floor Longworth office to check it out. The dashboard hangs off to the right just as visitors enter, and scrolls through slides showing everything from statistics on the shrinking of his state’s fishing fleet and how local energy prices compare to details on the bills the second-term congressman has backed and “the top five issues constituents want to talk about.” Stay there long enough and you'll also be treated to details on a Moulton obsession: the health benefits of the standing desk. Have a look. WYDEN PRESSES ICE ON STINGRAY USAGE — Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) is asking Thomas Homan, the acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, to detail how stingrays, devices that track cellphone signals, have been used to monitor and deport illegal immigrants, as described by a Detroit News report last week. “Stingrays impose too high a toll on communities to be used to investigate low level, non-violent offenses such as locating individuals who have entered the country illegally or overstayed a visa,” Wyden writes. SAVE UP YOUR QUESTIONS — Senate Commerce Chairman John Thune said there will be an opportunity to discuss hot-button topics like net neutrality and the proposed Sinclair-Tribune merger at confirmation hearings for two yet-unfilled commissioner slots at the FCC. “I think we will have an opportunity to do that because we will have some confirmation hearings coming up ... I mean, I assume the administration will send us a couple of nominations to fill the two vacancies on the FCC,” he said. Some House Democrats have called for an FCC oversight hearing to explore those issues.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Microsoft Corporation's Unfair Apple Inc. iPad Call-Out Apple's iPad Pro and Microsoft's Surface Pro may seem like similar devices that can be compared directly, but this Fool argues that that isn't the case. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) May 24, 2017 at 9:15AM Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) recently announced an updated version of its Surface Pro line of tablet/notebook computer hybrids. Among other improvements, the new tablet line includes Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) seventh-generation Core processors, which offer significant performance and power efficiency improvements over the sixth-generation Core chips found in the previous Surface Pro 4 tablets. Microsoft also couldn't help comparing the performance of the new Surface Pro with Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL), claiming that it offers "1.7 times the compute of iPad Pro." Microsoft also said that the new Surface Pro delivers "35% more battery life than an iPad Pro." Image source: Apple. Of course Microsoft is proud of its new device -- and it should be, as it looks like a solid product -- but here's why this comparison isn't fair. A new iPad Pro is coming soon The reality is that Microsoft's new Surface Pro isn't going to be competing with Apple's current 9.7-inch iPad Pro for most of its life in the marketplace. Instead, it will have to compete against the upcoming 10.5-inch iPad Pro that's expected to launch at Apple's upcoming World Wide Developers Conference next month. The new iPad should include an all-new applications processor, which may be called the A10X Fusion, that delivers a substantial uplift in both computing and graphics performance over the A9X chip found in the current 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro models. That uplift should be driven by both significant chip design advancements as well as a transition to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's (NYSE:TSM) new 10nm chip manufacturing technology, which should help boost efficiency and allow Apple to cram in more features and functionality than it would have otherwise been able to. I suspect that the computing performance of the new Surface Pro will look a lot less impressive next to the upcoming new iPad Pro than it does against the current, aging iPad Pro models. Not entirely comparable products Although both the Surface Pro and the iPad Pro are tablets and both are pitched toward "professional" use cases, the reality is that they are different devices. The iPad Pro tablets are still very much rooted in Apple's consumer tablet heritage, but they are endowed with "pro-friendly" features such as Apple Pencil support. These devices are thin and light, they're fanless, and they're designed to be used first and foremost as touchscreen devices. The Surface Pro lineup, on the other hand, has its heritage rooted in the traditional notebook personal computer. The device runs full-fat Windows 10, has full Intel Core i-series processors, and is, arguably, at its best when it's being used with traditional keyboard and mouse (or, in this case, trackpad) input. Yes, it has a touchscreen, and yes, it supports pen input -- and Microsoft does seem to put a lot of work into improving the pen experience with each generation. But if someone who's used to the iPad paradigm tried to use the Surface Pro like an iPad, he or she would probably have a negative experience. So a product like the Surface Pro and the iPad Pro shouldn't be compared on individual metrics such as battery life, performance, and so on. The real comparison from a consumer-facing perspective is ultimately one of usage model. Do consumers want tablet-first products that can also do double duty as so-called "pro" devices? Or do they want full-fat laptops that can handle traditional productivity software suites that can do double duty as a tablet and touchscreen device? That's a question that'll ultimately be answered in the years ahead.  Teresa Kersten is an employee of LinkedIn and is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: My 3 Biggest Stock Holdings Over the years, Apple, American Tower, and Enterprise Products Partners have grown to be the largest investments in my portfolio. Here's why I keep them around. Tyler Crowe (TMFDirtyBird) May 24, 2017 at 9:49AM Anyone who reads articles about finance and investing has a right to be skeptical of what they read. Who's to say that the writer doesn't have an ulterior motive? Are they trying to get you do do something that will directly benefit them? There's also the problem of financial content providers offering up advice that they themselves wouldn't take. So in the spirit of full disclosure -- and of eating one's own cooking -- I want to share with you the three biggest stock holdings in my portfolio: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), American Tower (NYSE:AMT), and Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE:EPD). Here's a brief explanation of why I continue to hold onto these companies.   Image source: Getty Images A non-tech approach to Apple I'll be the first to admit that I'm not a techie. I'm usually the person who says "Why the heck would anyone want that," when a new device, app or service appears, only to discover I was completely wrong as it takes off. So I can't speak with any authority on the tech behind Apple's products. The reasons that it's one of my three largest holdings have nothing to do with it being a tech company, though. Two factors make Apple appealing as an investment to me: pricing power, and shareholder-friendly buybacks and dividends. The one thing that even I can understand about technology is that it rapidly becomes commoditized, which typically makes competition in products such as smartphones and laptops a race to the bottom, where margins go to die. Apple has separated itself from its rivals in that regard, thanks in large part to the brand it has nurtured for all these years. When the first iPhone was launched in 2007, the initial retail price was $499, which at the time seemed absurd to me. Yes, I even remember saying at the time, "My Nokia brick phone does everything I need already." Despite its high price, the iPhone sold like gangbusters, to the point that today it owns a 30% share of the U.S. smartphone market, plus significant market share overseas. Furthermore, rumors floating around suggest that the new iPhone 8 will start at $999. Sure, the tech in the iPhone 8 is far beyond what that first model offered, but what is incredible is that there's still such huge demand for the company's products at those premium prices when there are so many lower-cost options out there. That kind of pricing power translates to almost unfathomable amounts of free cash flow -- so much so that there is no way Apple can spend it all on developing new products. So instead, it's spending tens of billions of dollars on share buybacks and paying an increasing dividend. While some may periodically criticize the company for the timing of those stock repurchases, it's hard to argue against the long-term impact of reducing its share count.  Perhaps this isn't the most insightful or eloquent investment thesis for Apple, but it's mine, and I feel comfortable riding it for several more years. An unsophisticated investment approach to data American Tower is another company leveraged to the world of technology, but it does so in the least technological way possible. It's a real estate investment trust that owns cellular network towers and leases space on them to wireless service providers. The most influential factor in why it is one of my largest holdings is it also happens to be one of my first stock holdings -- along with Apple, not surprisingly. The investment thesis I developed around American Tower is based on two things: the long-term trend toward greater data usage, and the long-term growth of its dividend payment. Again, I'm not a tech guy, but it doesn't take a tech genius to look around and see everyone's faces buried in smartphones and realize it takes an impressive amount of infrastructure to support that much data usage. And when you look at the numbers, they're staggering. Total data traffic in the U.S. alone in 2016 was 13.75 exabytes -- or 13.75 trillion megabytes. That's 3.3 times more than total data used in 2014. Moreover, American Tower estimates that U.S. data traffic will increase to 34.8 exabytes by 2020 as wireless carriers start to roll out 5G service. For wireless carriers, increasing data usage means they need to deploy more equipment to support their respective networks, and that hardware gets mounted on towers owned by companies like American Tower. And by leasing space on each tower to multiple tenants, those companies drastically improve their return on investment.  And naturally, the rising data use trend isn't just happening in the U.S. One of the most intriguing opportunities for American Tower is in the developing world, where wired connections are fewer and farther between. American Tower is investing heavily overseas in places where wireless penetration is high, but broadband penetration is still developing. In markets like that, the economics of cellphone towers are spectacular.  Source: American Tower investor presentation All that aside, here's what puts American Tower over the top for me as an investment: It's a business with high levels of recurring revenue and few maintenance capital obligations. Those factors make it ideally suited to generating free cash flow that can be returned to investors. While American Tower's 1.93% dividend won't wow anyone, management has grown that payout by 181% over the past five years.  American Tower is probably the most unsexy way to invest in the sexy trend of increasing data use around the world, but the company has proven thus far to be a great long-term investment, and it's one I plan to hold onto for a long time.  If I had to pick one energy investment, this is it Of all the companies in the oil and gas sector, I can't think of one I would want to own over the long haul more than Enterprise Products Partners. As a midstream operator that focuses on the transportation, logistics, and processing of hydrocarbons, it has the benefit of being largely insulated from the ups and downs of oil and gas prices. As it stands today, more than 85% of the company's gross profits come from fixed-fee contracts with volume commitments. This type of contract structure ensures Enterprise has a relatively steady revenue stream that supports the sustained growth of its network, and allows it to pay a generous distribution to its shareholders. There are a lot of similar companies in this business, and many of them share many qualities with Enterprise, like those fixed-fee contracts and handsome payouts. What separates Enterprise from the rest, though, is the way in which management handles the business.  One element where Enterprise's excellence first shows up is in its corporate structure. It doesn't have multiple subsidiaries below it, and the parent organization above it doesn't charge management fees (known in this sector as incentive distribution rights). Instead, that parent entity -- a holding company -- owns a significant portion of stock, but its holdings are of the same share class any retail investor can buy today. That means management's goals are more directly aligned with the interests of the other investors than is common among other companies in this business. This simpler structure also means Enterprise enjoys a lower cost of capital than rivals that carry the burden of incentive distribution rights. Also worth mentioning is that's it's just easier to understand Enterprise's financials because you don't have to follow the money through many corporate layers. The other thing that sets Enterprise's management apart is they have been great stewards of shareholder capital over the years. They have struck a great balance of paying a high-yield dividend, giving themselves plenty of room to grow that dividend every quarter, and retaining enough cash to grow the business without having to rely exclusively on external capital sources like debt and equity. These traits don't lend themselves to the production of intermittent blowout quarters, but they do translate to steady returns that have, over the years, obliterated the S&P 500 on a total return basis. EPD Total Return Price data by YCharts I don't know how much longer it will be before the U.S. and other developed countries start to shift away from fossil fuels in a meaningful way, but my guess is that it's still quite a few years away. As long as oil and gas provide the lion's share of our energy, then the company I want to own more than any other in this industry is Enterprise Products Partners.  Tyler Crowe owns shares of American Tower, Apple, and Enterprise Products Partners.

Apple reported in a biannual transparency report released on Tuesday that it received between 5,750 and 5,999 national security orders during the second half of 2016. Apple said that those orders affected between 4,750 and 4,999 user accounts. The U.S. government doesn't allow companies to divulge the actual number of national security orders they've received and instead requires them to provide a range in increments of 250. Apple said in its transparency report that it wants to provide specific numbers, but cannot because of federal regulation. The U.S. government also bans companies from revealing the full nature of the orders. However, Apple (aapl) was able to reveal that its national security orders were received under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which allows the government to spy on foreign targets, as well as National Security Letters, which serve as subpoenas on national security matters. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter Apple is among several technology companies—including Google (googl) and Microsoft (msft)—that regularly release transparency reports detailing government and law enforcement requests on user data. The companies receive requests from governments around the world for a wide array of reasons and on thousands of accounts. In some cases, when warrants aren't valid or requests overstep privacy concerns, the companies do not comply with such requests. Companies release regular reports to show trends in data requests. Apple's transparency report revealed a staggering uptick in government requests on data. During the first half of 2016, Apple received between 2,750 and 2,999 national security orders, and between 2,000 and 2,249 accounts were affected. The second half of the year saw those figures more than double. The technology giant didn't say in its report why more government requests were made during the second half of the year. Aside from the U.S., Apple received hundreds of requests on user account information from other countries around the world. Japanese law enforcement agencies, for instance, requested account information on 115 user accounts. German law enforcement sought information 159 accounts.

As even further incentive, the company is also offering those who wish to upgrade to its latest iPhones -or simply switch to iOS- the ability to hand in their current eligible smartphone and receive up to $260 in credit. You can learn more about iPhone Trade-up, here. Will it be easy to switch to iPhone? Yes, it will. There’s no need to save your stuff elsewhere before switching from Android. Just download the Move to iOS app from the Google Play Store and it securely transfers your content for you. That means things like your photos, videos, contacts, calendars, mail accounts, message history, and free apps — including Google Apps. And you can trade in your old smartphone, if eligible, for credit toward your new iPhone. Is the camera as good as they say? More pictures are taken on iPhone than any other camera in the world. We design the hardware and software together using second-to-none technology, so you can shoot amazing photos and videos in modes like Slo-Mo, Portrait, Time-Lapse, and more. iPhone also has cool features like Memories, which automatically compiles your favorite moments into a movie. Why is iPhone so fast? iPhone runs on high-performance chips that are custom-designed by Apple — including the most powerful chip ever in a smartphone. And because these chips are so efficient, iPhone delivers long battery life. Combine all that with the latest iOS updates offering smart new features, and everything you do on iPhone feels fast and fluid. Will iPhone be easy to use? You bet. Ease of use is at the core of everything Apple creates, and iOS is designed to be both simple and intuitive. With a swipe of your finger or a single tap, you can open apps, make a purchase with Apple Pay, or customize your iPhone. It also comes with the Tips app, so you can get the most out of your device. How does iPhone help protect my personal information? Privacy is a priority with Apple. Unlike many other phones, important data on your iPhone is encrypted from the start and protected by your passcode. Apple apps like Maps and Safari help to keep private all the places you go and the sites you visit, and Apple will not sell your information to anyone for any reason. Best of all we provide easy-to-install software updates that help to protect your device and your data from security threats. What makes Messages so great? The Messages app is both simple and powerful. It doesn’t just send messages — it also lets you hail rides, book restaurants, and even shoot lasers. All your conversations will be kept private, because every message is encrypted from end to end. And, of course, you can use other messaging apps like WeChat, WhatsApp, or Facebook Messenger, too. Can I get help from a real person? No matter where you are, we have real human beings ready to help. Whether you want to know more about switching, or about software on your new iPhone, Apple’s award-winning support team offers assistance of any kind. Just call a Specialist, chat online, or visit an Apple Store. There’s also an Apple Support app and a dedicated Twitter handle @AppleSupport. Can I switch at an Apple Store? Absolutely. Apple Specialists are friendly, knowledgeable, and ready to assist you in switching. They can activate your new iPhone with a carrier of your choice and help you transfer your important content to your new device. You can also attend How To sessions, which are part of the Today at Apple program, to learn how to do even more with iPhone. What about the environment? We think about the environment all the time. Every time you send an iMessage, make a FaceTime call, or ask Siri a question, those tasks are handled by Apple data servers running on 100 percent renewable energy. And when you switch to iPhone, we’ll even recycle your Android phone for you. Will I love my iPhone? iPhone has industry-leading satisfaction rates — in fact, 97 percent of people who have an iPhone say they love it. That’s a lot of smiling selfies. A lot of happy emoji. And a lot of people who are glad they chose the world’s most loved smartphone. Continue Reading You may also like...

Written By Nigel Roberts Posted 17 hours ago Leave a comment 353 reads Apple hired Denise Young Smith, who headed its global human resources program, as its first vice president of diversity and inclusion, CNN reports. Smith started her new position on Monday and will report directly to Apple CEO Tim Cook. Denise Young Smith has been at Apple since 1997 https://t.co/eM12ncGVG8 Via @cnntech — CNNMoney (@CNNMoney) May 24, 2017 Apple’s diversity report states that the company worldwide is 68 percent male. Here in the United States, the tech giant is 56 percent White, 19 percent Asian, 12 percent Hispanic and 9 percent Black. Diversity remains an elusive goal for Apple and the technology industry. Cook told Mashable that the tech community is at “fault” for the gender disparity. “I think in general we haven’t done enough to reach out and show young women that it’s cool to do it and how much fun it can be,” he said. The CEO added that his company is conducting outreach efforts from middle school through college to encourage women to pursue tech careers. Apple is also connecting with historically Black colleges and Universities, he said. TechCrunch reported that Jeffrey Siminoff, who left the company in 2015, was the last person to lead Apple’s diversity efforts. Siminoff, however, held a director role. Smith, as a vice president, is empowered to have greater impact on the company’s initiatives.

By Adrian Kingsley-Hughes for Hardware 2.0 | May 24, 2017 -- 13:20 GMT (06:20 PDT) | Topic: Apple Android makes gains in China while iOS slips: Kantar China is Apple's second-largest market after the US, so any signs of a problem there would be very serious. Well, we have signs of a problem brewing there. See also: The quickest, simplest way to speed up an old, tired PC Business Insider reports that according to Bernstein analysts Toni Sacconaghi Jr. and Daniel Chen, iPhone sales have dropped 20 percent in China. "Apple's recent weakness in China has largely been due to iPhone. During the Q2 17 earnings call, Apple spoke of 20 percent revenue growth for Mac and 'double-digit growth' for Services in Greater China, which suggests that iPhone + iPad revenue must have declined at least double digits at constant currency. Third party market research (IDC) corroborates that Apple's >$500 ASP smartphone units declined >20 percent in each of the past 5 quarters in Mainland China." That's a pretty steep decline. iPhone 8: Here's everything we think we know... SEE FULL GALLERY 1 - 5 of 12 NEXT PREV Business Insider even has a chart that shows just how much China revenue has changed over the past four years: BI Intelligence Oppenheimer analyst Andrew Uerkwitz thinks he has an answer. "We recently conducted a series of company meetings in China and Taiwan that focused on the smartphone supply chain. There was general consensus among our conversations that confirms our thesis that Apple's dwindling market share in Greater China is due to the lack of compelling differentiation among hardware and software."

Another, possibly more optimistic, opinion shared by some analysts is that people are delaying a purchase because they are waiting to see what Apple comes up with next. But that not only puts huge pressure on Apple to "hit it out of the park" with the next release, but to also be able to keep up with demand, a skill Apple has lacked as of late (most recently the company admitted that it had underestimated the demand for the iPhone 7 Plus). It will be interesting to see how Apple responds to this. Over the past few years we've seen the company go on an all-out assault to win over Chinese users, and it looks like that might not have been enough. Will Apple play a "wait and see" game, and see how the next iPhone, especially the iPhone 8, goes down, or will it alter course now to try to fend off further declines?

Samsung case, which had received very significant support from software and Internet companies, non-governmental, reports FOSS Patents.   In its filing Monday, Apple argued that the lower court's ruling was correct and that the case wasn't worth consideration by the Supreme Court because the patent laws themselves weren't in dispute. It also said that even if the issues were in dispute, the case isn't a good one to use for setting new legal precedent.   Specifically, Apple noted in their filing that "Samsung's petition challenges two Federal Circuit decisions, neither of which implicates any broad or disputed question of substantive patent law. The petition should be denied."   You could view Apple's 'Brief in Opposition" in Full here and read some analysis of this filing at FOSS Patents here.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

But unlike other tech companies who have been ordered to turn over customer information to the FBI, Apple hasn't yet published the demand letter it received. Apple's transparency report also includes several new categories of government requests, an indication that the company is becoming more granular in the way it reports data about its interactions with law enforcement. Photo: Getty The FBI uses National Security Letters (NSLs) to obtain consumer information from tech companies without a warrant. The process doesn't require approval from a judge, but the FBI can only obtain basic subscriber information through the process, like an email address. NSLs used to be issued in secret, with indefinite gag orders that prevented companies from ever acknowledging their existence. But since the passage of the USA Freedom Act in 2015, the FBI is required to routinely review the indefinite gag orders. Some orders have been lifted and tech firms are slowly being allowed to acknowledge their receipt of NSLs. Yahoo, Google, Cloudflare and Microsoft have all published NSLs in the last year. Apple's latest transparency report, which covers July through December 2016, discloses that the company received one "declassified" NSL. The letters are typically light on details, but they do reveal when the request was made and which FBI bureau made it. They also contain the customer information used to make the request, such as their email address or account name, but that's redacted. If Apple does publish its letter, it would likely shed more light on when it received the FBI demand. Apple's use of "declassified" in its reporting language, along with the fact that it usually takes some time for the FBI to review old gag orders, suggests that Apple probably received the NSL some time ago and is only now allowed to make that fact public. Apple says it received somewhere between 5750-5999 national security orders during the six-month period, including both NSLs and FISA orders. The requests impacted 4750-4999 accounts — more than double the amount it received in the first half of 2016, according to ZDNet. "We report all the national security orders we have received, including orders received under FISA and NSLs, in bands of 250. Though we want to be more specific, this is currently the narrowest range allowed by the government," Apple wrote in the report. US government requests for Apple data are on the rise. In 2016, Apple answered 11,658 requests covering 43,321 devices and accounts. That's up from 9810 requests on 33,748 devices and accounts in 2015. Apple says that, although requests are on the rise overall, approximately 80 per cent of law enforcement requests are made by officials working with a customer to search for a lost or stolen device. The other 20 per cent tend to be for iCloud account data like photos or messages. It attributes the increasing requests to its sales numbers — more people than ever own Apple devices — and to law enforcement's growing appetite for useful investigative data. For law enforcement, Apple can be a particularly rich source of useful information. Although Apple resists law enforcement requests it considers overreaching and encrypts information stored on its devices, it can turn over data stored in iCloud. iCloud data proved particularly useful earlier this year during an effort to reveal the identity of a Twitter user who allegedly tweeted a seizure-inducing gif at the writer Kurt Eichenwald. Although Twitter was only able to provide a dummy email address and phone number to law enforcement, Apple was able to reveal the user's identity. He's now facing criminal charges related to the tweet. Apple's transparency report also breaks down seven new categories of requests, including emergency government requests and private party requests for account information. Other tech companies don't often break out requests from private parties, but Apple's report notes that these kinds of requests are growing, thanks to litigation.

Screenshot Microsoft held a big Surface event in Shanghai overnight. While the event was basically impossible to watch in America, with a broken liveblog and zero English livestreams, savvy viewers (and those fluent in Chinese) might have caught the big news. There's a new Surface Pro. It's been more than sixteen months since Microsoft's landmark tablet-laptop hybrid saw an update. In the intervening time, Microsoft has seen a lot of competitors attempt to encroach on the 2-1 device space While some of those clones have been aesthetically delightful, few have approached the slick combination of design and quality the Surface Pro delivers. So a refresh is welcomed, and this year's refresh could fix some of the tablet laptop's biggest problems, even if the name is stupid. Want Gizmodo's email newsletter?

That's why in 1993 Cheyer, who was then working in at the SRI International research lab, built the first prototype of what would one day become Siri, the automated voice assistant on Apple iPhones. Over two decades, Cheyer built 50 versions of his Siri technology. But it wasn't until the iPhone was released in 2007 that his team saw an imminent opportunity for others to use Siri in a way that would make them money. Photo courtesy Adam Cheyer Adam Cheyer, co-founder of Siri and Viv Labs Cheyer, with co-founders Dag Kittlaus and Tom Gruber, spent the next couple of years building a commercial version of Siri, and in February 2010, the company he co-founded, Siri, Inc., launched Siri as an app in the Apple store, alongside hundreds of thousands of other apps. Apparently it stood out, because two to three weeks after launch, Steve Jobs called Cheyer's office, unannounced. He wanted to buy Siri, its technology and Siri, Inc. Cheyer and the Siri team refused Jobs' first buyout offer. "With no hesitation, we said we were flattered but that we weren't looking to sell at that time," says Cheyer. "We had just raised a new round of funding and had gone through a successful launch. ...[A]n acquisition was just not something we were actively seeking." But when Jobs came back a few months later, they sold Siri to Apple in April 2010 for more than $200 million, according to reports. For a year and a half, Cheyer worked at Apple to create the version of Siri that now exists on the iPhone. It wasn't Cheyer's only multimillion-dollar exit: He went on to co-found Viv Labs, an artificial intelligence assistant company, which the South Korean electronics giantSamsung acquired in 2016 for about $215 million, according to reports. It's safe to say Cheyer is a successful entrepreneur. He's proven that he knows what it takes to build a successful company, and according to the serial founder, it's these four things: Photo courtesy AFP Siri on an Apple iPhone in 2012 An ambitious idea "[The idea] needs to be big enough, ambitious enough," Cheyer tells CNBC. It also needs to have a market and "be something that people could need or that you can convince them that they would need," he says. The right team To launch a successful start-up, you have to have the right co-founders, says Cheyer. "You cannot do it all by yourself. In order to execute on a company, you really need different skill sets." There are four essential components, according to Cheyer. Every start-up needs a visionary who can think big; a product development expert who can translate the idea into an actionable to-do list; a marketing expert who can communicate the idea to the world; and of course, people to execute the idea. "Maybe as a founder you can be one or two of those things, but it's rare you'll find someone who can do all four," says Cheyer. "So you need to find the right people to join you as the core team to take it to market." Photo courtesy Adam Cheyer Adam Cheyer speaking at the Congress of Future Science and Technology Leaders in 2016 Other people's money "When you're in it, you're so close to it, you're really not a good judge" of how worthy your idea is, says Cheyer. So having to convince other people to give you their money to fund your start-up is a good test, he says. Killer execution "It's about execution. And what does execution mean? It means you have a limited amount of time and resources — you have to make the right decisions," says Cheyer. Steve Jobs famously said: "I'm actually as proud of the things we haven't done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things." Cheyer agrees, saying what you say no to is just as important as what you aggressively pursue. "Every decision you make, when you choose to do something, that means you're choosing not to do many other things," explains Cheyer. "Every decision you make impacts what you end up with and how you get there."

Titled “App Development with Swift”, the new curriculum is now available as a free download from iBooks Store. It’s an extension of Apple’s existing K-12 Everyone Can Code curricula, which has been downloaded 430,000 times. Noting that the app economy and software development are among the fastest-growing job sectors in America, Apple CEO Tim Cook says his company is thrilled to be providing educators and students with the tools to learn coding. “Community colleges play a critical role in helping students achieve their dreams, and we hope these courses will open doors for people of all ages and backgrounds to pursue what they love,” said Cook. The full-year course focuses on app design and development with Swift, the company’s modern programming language. It includes various Swift Playgrounds exercises and Xcode tutorials, as well as homework projects, a teacher guide with solutions, grading advice and more. Starting this fall, the following community college systems serving nearly 500,000 students nationwide will teach the new curriculum, among others: Alabama Community College System Columbus State Community College Harrisburg Area Community College Houston Community College Mesa Community College San Mateo Community College District Houston Community College will be opening an iOS Coding and Design School to teach the new curriculum. “We are thrilled Apple is offering this incredible opportunity to advance student learning, which will especially help us bridge the gap in computer science training for minorities and women,” said Houston Community College Chancellor Cesar Maldonado. “We can’t wait to see what these students will do and already have local businesses offering mentoring and internship opportunities.” Apple says that select high schools will teach the curriculum as well. At many campuses, local businesses will also offer students mentoring and internships, added the firm. More than a thousand schools across the US plan to teach with Everyone Can Code materials in the fall. Feel free to check out Apple’s existing free coding materials on iBooks Store.

James Martin/CNET Security by Shara Tibken May 23, 2017 5:03 PM PDT @sharatibken The US and other governments around the world needed a lot of help getting data from Apple devices last year. The number of national security orders issued to Apple by US law enforcement doubled to about 6,000 in the second half of 2016, compared with the first half of the year, Apple disclosed in its biannual transparency report. Those requests included orders received under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, as well as national security letters, the latter of which are issued by the FBI and don't require a judge's sign-off. Critics of national security letters, like the Electronic Frontier Foundation, say they "allow the FBI to secretly demand data about ordinary American citizens' private communications and Internet activity without any meaningful oversight or prior judicial review." Companies that receive national security letters are subject to gag orders, which means they can't even disclose they've received such orders -- unless the letters become declassified. See also Twitter makes two national security letters public Apple vs. FBI one year later: Still stuck in limbo How an iPhone became the FBI's public enemy No. 1 (FAQ) That's what happened in Apple's case. It disclosed late Monday, as part of its most recent transparency report, that one of the national security orders it received came in the form of a declassified national security letter. It didn't provide any more information about the letter, including when it originally received the order or what the order involved. Other companies have shared more information about the requests when they're declassified. Apple on Tuesday declined to comment beyond its transparency report, as did the US Department of Justice. National security letters were enabled by the USA Freedom Act, which passed in 2015. As part of the regulations, the FBI has to re-examine past national security letters and decide which can be declassified. Those started being reported by recipients a year ago. Apple's not the only company that's received national security letters. Twitter disclosed in January that it received two from the FBI in the last two years that previously came with gag orders not to discuss them. Google, Yahoo and Cloudflare also have published national security letters received from the FBI, some dating back to 2013. For more on Apple's National Security Letter, see the coverage by CNET sister site ZDnet, which first reported on Apple's transparency report. Battling the FBI Apple has long helped US law enforcement agencies pull data from locked iPhones. But its willingness to help has changed over the past couple of years as the number of requests increase and as the government faces backlash over its surveillance tactics. Apple fought a very public battle against the FBI last year, and it has taken a strong stance in favor of protecting customer privacy. The FBI's attempt last year to force Apple to unlock an iPhone used by a terrorist set up a grand legal battle between security and privacy. On one side was Apple, a massive tech company envisioning a future similar to the one in George Orwell's novel "1984" (which, coincidentally, has become a bestseller again after President Donald Trump's inauguration). On the other was the world's most powerful government, pointing to the threat of a terrorist attack if it can't get access to vital information. FBI drops Apple court case after unlocking terrorist's iPhone The Feds have found a way into the San Bernardino terrorist's iPhone with help from an unknown third party, but bigger security questions remain for Apple. by Claire Reilly 1:06 Close Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF The stakes were sky-high. Cybersecurity experts said the dispute could have far-reaching implications for everything from how private our personal photos are to how tech companies operate in other countries. But the battle ended in a draw when the FBI in March suddenly said it didn't need Apple's help anymore to unlock the phone. Along with disclosing the number of national security orders it has received, Apple on Monday said it received 4,254 device requests in the US in the second half of 2016, down from 4,822 in the first six months of the year. It gave information in 78 percent of the cases in both halves of the year. Most device requests come from law enforcement agencies helping iPhone owners who've requested help locating lost or stolen devices. Other requests relate to fraud investigations. Apple also said it received 2,231 account information requests across the globe in the second half of 2016. In the US, the total was 1,219. It gave data in regard to 79 percent of the global requests and 83 percent of the US orders. In the first half of the year, it provided data for 84 percent of the 1,363 US requests it received. The company said "examples of such requests are where law enforcement agencies are working on cases where they suspect an account may have been used unlawfully or in violation of Apple's terms of service. Account-based requests generally seek details of customers' iTunes or iCloud accounts, such as a name and address; and in certain instances customers' iCloud content, such as stored photos, email, iOS device backups, contacts or calendars."

App Development with Swift is a full-year course designed by Apple engineers and educators to teach students elements of app design using Swift, one of the world’s most popular programming languages. Students will learn to code and design fully functional apps, gaining critical job skills in software development and information technology. Starting this fall, the curriculum will be offered at six community colleges. At many campuses, local businesses will also offer students mentoring and internships. “We’ve seen firsthand the impact that coding has on individuals and the US economy as a whole. The app economy and software development are among the fastest-growing job sectors in America and we’re thrilled to be providing educators and students with the tools to learn coding,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “Community colleges play a critical role in helping students achieve their dreams, and we hope these courses will open doors for people of all ages and backgrounds to pursue what they love.” The curriculum will be offered by the Alabama Community College System, Columbus State Community College, Harrisburg Area Community College, Houston Community College, Mesa Community College and San Mateo Community College District, among others. Select high schools across the country will also be teaching the App Development with Swift curriculum starting this fall. Houston Community College is opening an iOS Coding and Design School that will teach Apple’s new curriculum. “The world calls Houston a knowledge capital because of the incredible concentration of ideas and innovation in our great city,” said Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner. “Apple’s investment in our community with the launch of the app development curriculum will tap into the creativity of our students, inspire new possibilities and foster our culture of technological transformation.” “We are focused on preparing our students for life in a global and technological society, and in 2017 that means making sure our students have access to a state-of-the-art coding curriculum,” said Houston Community College Chancellor Cesar Maldonado. “We are thrilled Apple is offering this incredible opportunity to advance student learning, which will especially help us bridge the gap in computer science training for minorities and women. We can’t wait to see what these students will do and already have local businesses offering mentoring and internship opportunities.” The curriculum has yet to go live on iBooks Store but we'll update this article with a link when it does.

According to the data, which features several new request categories, Apple is making an effort to be as clear as possible about the types of information governments around the world have asked for. Apple's report is the most detailed report the company has produced yet. Worldwide, Apple received 30,184 device requests, covering 151,105 devices. Apple provided data for 21,737 device requests, which equates to a 72 percent response rate. In the U.S. specifically, Apple responded to 3,335 requests out of 4,268 (78 percent). According to Apple, device-based requests cover fraud investigations as well as customers who have asked law enforcement to help locate lost or stolen devices. Apple received 2,392 financial identifier requests worldwide, covering 21,249 devices. Apple provided information for 1,821 of the requests, which are related to cases where law enforcement officials are working on behalf of customers who have asked for help with fraudulent credit card activity. When it comes to worldwide government account requests, Apple received 2,231, rejecting 175 of those, and providing no data for 471. Non-content data was provided for 1,350 requests, and content was offered up in 410 cases. A total of 8,880 accounts were affected. In the United States, Apple says it received between 5750 and 5999 National Security Requests under FISA and National Security Letters, which affected 4750 to 4999 accounts. Apple is not allowed to provide specific numbers, but offers up the narrowest range permissible by law. U.S. National Security requests increased significantly in the second half of 2016 compared to the first half of the year. In its first 2016 transparency report, Apple said it received 2750 to 2999 National Security orders affecting 2000 to 2249 accounts. According to the data, Apple also received one "declassified" National Security Letter from the FBI. National Security Letters are traditionally kept secret via a gag order that prevents companies from sharing information about them, but following the USA Freedom Act, the rules have been loosened and tech companies are now able to publish National Security Letters when declassified. Apple is able to publish the content of the letter, but has not done so. Apple's data is broken down into multiple additional categories, covering government requests for emergencies such as missing children, account deletion/restriction requests, and account preservation requests, all of which can be viewed directly in the report. The company also provides more information on government account requests by legal process type, including search warrant, wiretap orders, subpoenas, pen register/trap and trace orders, and other types of court orders.

They were authorized by the Patriot Act shortly after 9/11. And the patriot act was one of the worst invasions of privacy in recent decades and has provided no real benefit. Rating: 12 Votes ThunderSkunk 2 days ago at 11:29 am We have a network of computers that can access the internet, and a seperate quarantined network of computers that are physically not connected to those machines or the internet whatsoever, for high-security projects and to ensure our cnc machines and other critical systems stay impervious to hacking or stuxnet-like malware run amok. The "internet of things" can go take a flying leap. It seems to me this is what anyone concerned about their privacy would do as well. Keep your sensitive data on a strictly offline computer, and use essentially a dumb terminal to access the internet. Have no accounts, and obfuscate your digital identity with misinformation wherever possible to screw things up. It really wouldn't take much effort, just a decision to not put all your info on a platter and then complain when it's a smorgasbord and Uncle Sam or the Kremlin (same thing now?) come along and make a meal out of it. Probably too late for Facebook and google users though. Rating: 7 Votes nt5672 1 day ago at 01:35 pm . . . . . I could care less if the government sees what I text my significant other, if it means potentially protecting the lives of people I care about (or people I've never met before). I understand that right now, but history tells that what the government and what the people considers important, changes when the government is given unlimited power. Once they get the power they may decide for example, that you only get one child, or that in order to support diversity you can only marry someone from another race, or maybe that your race or political outlook becomes out of favor and the police are looking to arrest people with your beliefs. In fact, is currently impossible for people to live normal lives without breaking some law someplace. Why is that? Now one might think it is for order in society, but in fact, when there are so many laws that people can be arrested anytime, the laws can be used anytime to control anyone. For example the government can and does take property every day without due course. What happens when they decide to take yours? Total control is what the government wants and they consistently scare people into thinking it is necessary. Life without risk is impossible. For example, if you were a conservative, then under Obama the IRS targeted you. Who knows, it may be that under Trump he will target liberals with the IRS. I'll bet I can tell what your political leaning is by monitoring your communications with your significant other. People in general need to wake up. This discussion is not about today, but is about what happens when one political party controls the administration, congress, the media, and the supreme court. And right now we are pretty darn close. People don't realize because the media is controller by democrat dogma that when Obama threw out 100 years of law regarding bond holders in the GM take over. He also (well his GM czar) in Illinois closed all GM dealerships with Republican ties. I don't personally know about other states, but I'll bet it was nationwide. You really want to live under a government that is that powerful? That can decide that 100 years of law don't matter anymore? That can decide at any point that you don't have any rights. Well I don't and if we are forced to I don't want the government to be able to monitor me. The worst threat to American people today is the American government!

Take the number of requests, divide by the US population of 321.4 million, move the decimal. .0015%. There's your answer. You're so much more informed now. :rolleyes: Per capita doesn't tell us a thing. The point is simply that they're increasing a bit, though still not that many requests (although MacRumors as always tries hard to sensationalize everything in order to drive more web traffic and outrage). Are you that condescending in real life or just when there's a keyboard involved? You say they're increasing "a bit," but what is a bit? National Security Requests 1st Half 2014: 0-249 2nd Half 2014: 250-499 1st Half 2015: 750-999 2nd Half 2015: 1250-1499 1st Half 2016: 2750-2999 2nd Half 2016: 5750-5999 *Chart displays the lowest number of the request ranges The chart might explain why MacRumors refers to it as a "spike." Maybe they aren't just sensationalizing.

Image Credit: Sensor Tower Apple’s App Store is creating twice as many newly minted $1 million publishers as Google Play in the U.S., according to a report by measurement firm Sensor Tower. Sensor Tower’s Store Intelligence data reveals that more app publishers are achieving the important milestone on Apple’s App Store than on Google Play, based on an analysis of in-app revenues for developers who are hitting $1 million in revenue for the first time. This data tells you why Apple’s monetization leadership in the world’s second largest market for app spending is important. Not only are consumers spending more per device through its platform, but a greater number of up-and-coming publishers are reaping the financial rewards each year. Nearly double the number of publishers made their first $1 million in annual revenue last year on the U.S. App Store compared to Google Play. In all, 66 publishers met or surpassed this benchmark figure on Apple’s store in 2016, which was 1.7 times more than the 39 that managed the same degree of success on Google’s platform. Above: Categories of publishers with first $1 million or greater year in 2016. Image Credit: Sensor Tower The number of publishers who had their first $1 million or greater year on the U.S. App Store in 2016 nearly doubled over 2015, when 34 surpassed that mark in terms of annual U.S. revenue. While it still trails behind the App Store by this measure, Google Play grew its number of equivalent publishers on its U.S. store considerably more than Apple’s platform in 2016, by nearly 2.8 times from 14 in 2015. That is a promising statistic. Sensor Tower also focused on which categories these app makers are focusing on. Games publishers accounted for the single largest category of first-time million-dollar earners across both platforms. But they were far more prominent on Google Play, where they constituted 75 percent of the total, compared to just 47 percent on the App Store. Above: Here is a chart showing the year-over-year change in the percentage of new $1 million publishers in the Games category. Image Credit: Sensor Tower The report also found that publishers also had their first million-dollar year across a more diverse set of categories on Apple’s store. Social Networking, Entertainment, Lifestyle, Photo & Video, and Utilities publishers accounted for more than 5 percent of the total on iOS. Dating app publishers made up seven of the 66 publishers that earned $1 million or more for the first time on the App Store last year, including the likes of Coffee Meets Bagel, Bumble, and Clover. Other standouts that exceeded this the milestone included teen-focused “chat stories” app Hooked and the fast-growing video sharing app Musical.ly. On Google Play, only Social Networking and Entertainment publishers accounted for more than 5 percent of the total apart from Games. Google Play is showing positive momentum in terms of monetization, but given its substantially larger user base and download volume compared to its in-app revenue generation, it still has a considerable way to go before it’s on level footing with Apple’s ecosystem in the U.S. and worldwide. Among the stand-out publishers on the App Store from 2016 are PokerStars (PokerStars Poker), Seven Pirates (Ark of War), and BitMango (Block! Hexa Puzzle). On Google Play, the stand-outs were Playdots (Two Dots), Zeptolab (King of Thieves), and Super Evil Megacorp (Vainglory).

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 24 May 2017 by Persistence Market Research Apple Concentrates Market : Solid apple segment to Grow at 11% revenue share Persistence Market Research, in its recently published report titled “Global Market Study on Apple Concentrate: Liquid Concentrate Segment Anticipated to Register the Highest CAGR in Terms of Value over the Forecast Period ”, predicts that the global apple concentrate market will witness modest growth during the next decade. In terms of volume, the global apple concentrate market will cross 3 million tonnes by 2026. By revenues, this US$ 2.0 Bn market is likely to see a promising CAGR of 5.6% through 2026. Juice Concentrate Sub-segment will Maintain 90%+ Revenue Share Throughout the Forecast Period Demand for liquid apple concentrates will continue to rake in the bulk of market revenues, with the solid apple concentrate segment projected to account for a paltry 11% revenue share of the market. Used widely in juices, vinegar, ciders, bakery, and other products, the juice concentrate sub-segment will maintain 90%+ revenue share throughout the forecast period. By application, beverages will continue to account for the highest demand for apple concentrates, with juices and ciders accounting for the highest consumption. Within the food segment, bakery and confectionary will lead, followed by the dairy and frozen products sub-segment. New Concentrate Products and Non-GMO Apple Varieties will Continue to Enter the Market Launch of new apple concentrate-based products will continue to remain a pervasive trend. Supported by diverse products, the market will also be favored by another strong supply-side driver – competitive production costs. Consumer preference for apple concentrate over apple fruit will persist, as it offers the same nutrient content as apple but with an extended shelf-life suitable for transportation, storage, and usage. Consumer preference for non-GMO products will influence the global apple concentrate market, with demand for non-GMO variants expected to witness a steady uptick during the forecast period. Adoption of non-GMO apple concentrate is steadily growing in the F&B sector, which currently relies heavily on organic apples for its range of ‘health and wellness’ offerings. APEJ to Remain the Most Lucrative Market APEJ will maintain its preeminent position over the next decade, expanding at a robust CAGR of 10.8% in terms of value. China will remain the largest producer of apple concentrate, maintaining over 75% share by production capacity throughout the forecast period. Australia, New Zealand, and India will be the other lucrative markets in APEJ. While APEJ will witness steady growth, markets in North America and Japan are projected to witness sluggish growth over the forecast period. Low production-high demand will shape-up the market in MEA, wherein maximum consumption will be registered by GCC countries. Request to view table of content @ http://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/market-research/apple-fruit-concentrate-market/toc Some of the most prominent players governing the competitive landscape of the global apple concentrate market include Agrana Juice, Tree Top, Doehler Group, Shaanxi Hengtong, Huiyuan Juice, Britvic PLC, Welch Foods, Rauch Fruit Juice, Pfanner, and Cobell. Among these, Agrana Juice, Tree Top, and Doehler Group are the top market revenue shareholders. A sample of this report is available upon request @ http://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/samples/5915 As a differentiating strategy to win over other counterparts, Agrana is focusing on M&A activities and R&D investments. While Doehler is concentrating on production capacity expansion, Tree Top is dedicatedly coveting successful new product launches. On the other side, Britvic has a distinctive strategy for product positioning and sales. Tier 1 players currently account for over US$ 1,000 Mn, whereas tier 2 companies generate collective revenues over US$ 460 Mn.

The Finnish company signed a patent license and a business cooperation agreement with Apple, Nokia said in a press release. Nokia said it would receive an up-front cash payment from Apple with additional revenues during the term of the agreement. However, the details of the agreement remain confidential. Under the business collaboration agreement, Nokia will provide network infrastructure products and services to Apple, and Apple will sell Nokia digital health products (formerly under the Withings brand) in its retail and online stores. Furthermore, the two firms are seeking for future collaboration in the field of digital health. The top executives of Nokia and Apple will meet regularly to "ensure that the relationship works effectively and to the benefit of both parties and their customers." Maria Varsellona, chief legal officer at Nokia, described the agreement as meaningful between the two companies. "It moves our relationship with Apple from being adversaries in court to business partners working for the benefit of our customers," she said. In December 2016, Nokia filed a number of lawsuits against Apple, alleging that it had violated 32 of its patents. As a result of the legal disputes, Apple pulled all health accessories under the brand of Withings, owned by Nokia following a purchase in April 2016, from its retail sales outlets.

Almost half of firms believe the current wave of technology will fundamentally transform their industry, but only a third feel their business has the skills to adapt, according to a new survey by the Confederation of British Industry in association with IBM. The CBI warned of a growing digital gap between those UK firms that are leading the way on technological developments and those who are being left behind.

Companies are also investing in the internet of things which links appliances together as well as advanced analytics which allows companies to gain insights from huge amounts of data. The CBI said: “Innovation in business is essential for advanced economies such as the UK. It is the chief driver of sustainable economic growth and a major source of productivity gains. It also pulls in overseas investment, supporting thousands of jobs across the country.

And so the owner, unaware of its value, wore it for decades, while doing everything from the shopping to the chores.

Nestlé argues that the KitKat’s shape is “iconic” and should be protected by law but Cadbury objects.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: Apple Apple is testing next-gen 5G wireless tech for the iPhone Yoni Heisler @edibleapple May 24th, 2017 at 8:51 AM Share Tweet No matter how many iPhones Apple sells in a given quarter, it never seems to be enough for some analysts and tech pundits. Even in instances where iPhone sales exceed expectations, the narrative that we’ve reached peak iPhone inevitably begins to take hold. The prospect for accelerated iPhone growth, however, is higher now than it’s been in quite some time. Not only is the iPhone 8 release looming on the horizon, but people seem to be forgetting that we’re about to jump head-first into a hyper-fast world of 5G connectivity, and Apple is already keen on getting in on the action. Don't Miss: Somehow, everyone walked away from this massive Tesla crash On Tuesday afternoon, Apple applied for an experimental license from the FCC to test next-gen 5G wireless technologies, according to a recent report from Business Insider. Apple’s application reads in part: Apple Inc. seeks to assess cellular link performance in direct path and multipath environments between base station transmitters and receivers using this spectrum… These assessments will provide engineering data relevant to the operation of devices on wireless carriers’ future 5G networks. Apple indicates that it plans to test 5G technologies in two locations in controlled facilities, one in Cupertino and another in Milpitas, California. Apple also relays that it plans to use the 28 and 39 GHz bands via technology provided by Rohde & Schwarz, A.H. Systems, and Analog Devices. Apple’s application also notes that it “will conduct its experiments for a period not to exceed 12 months.” Consequently, it stands to reason that the 2019 iPhone 9 will be the first iPhone Apple bestows with 5G connectivity. Incidentally, AT&T just a few months ago said that it will begin rolling out its own 5G network to a few lucky cities later this year. Of course, if there’s one thing we know about Apple, it will have no problem delaying the release of a 5G iPhone until overall 5G coverage becomes commonplace.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Smartphones Waiting for Samsung Galaxy Note 8? Samsung is already working on next big release Samsung Galaxy Note 8 is a big one coming this year, but 2018 seems more promising for Samsung. Sami Khan   May 24, 2017 18:37 IST Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 smartphones are displayed during the Samsung Unpacked event in New York City, United States March 29, 2017.REUTERS/Brendan McDermid Apple iPhone 8, OnePlus 5 and Samsung Galaxy Note 8 are some of the most anticipated releases for this year, but tech giants like Apple and Samsung like to stay ahead of the game. Following rumours about iPhone 9 development, a fresh report by Korean publication The Bell has some news on Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9 Plus – the rumoured flagships set to release in 2018. Seem too early? Definitely, yes! But Samsung is already ahead of schedule in developing the 2018 flagship, and it has chosen "Star" and "Star 2" as codenames for Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9 Plus. While the reason behind the codename remains a mystery, it is possible that the next year's flagships will shine as bright as a star. In all fairness, the codenames chosen by Samsung are quite mysterious. Galaxy S8 was codenamed "Project Dream" and the Galaxy Note 8 is being called "Great." Kim Hye-deok, executive director of product strategy team at Samsung Electronics' wireless division, had revealed that the Galaxy S8's codename was about the flagship's "dream to overcome Apple," The Bell reported. Codenames "Great" and "Star" certainly have a hidden meaning, which we'll know when Samsung launches the products. What's really important at this point is that Samsung has already started work on Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9 Plus 3-4 months ahead of schedule. The unannounced flagships are still in early stages of development, and speculating anything at this point is subject to change at some point until the official launch in the first half of next year. But the sources reportedly confirmed that Galaxy S9 will have the critically-acclaimed Infinite Display as seen in Galaxy S8. "We know that the display spec is similar to Galaxy S8, although it's early in development," an industry official was quoted as saying. We can expect Samsung to use upgraded chipsets, preferably its own processor based on 7nm architecture or borrow it from Qualcomm. Based on the growing trend in the industry, dual camera, fingerprint scanner under the display and AR/VR capabilities will likely make their way to the flagships. But as we said earlier, it's too soon to predict anything so early.

We also provided a video in a secondary report that touched on the breakthrough that Apple's LuxVue micro-LED team will bring to the table in the not-too-distant future. Today the news about micro-LED keeps pouring in with news of trial runs being scheduled in the 2017-2018 timeline.    A new supply chain report surfacing today notes that "a few makers engaged in R&D for micro-LED display products, despite many technological bottlenecks, are expected to take the initiative to begin trial production in the second half of 2017 at the earliest, according to industry sources.   Apple has been keen in the development of micro LED technology following its acquisition of LuxVue in 2014, and recent market speculations also indicate that Apple is likely to crank out a small volume of micro-LED display products from its plant in Taoyuan, northern Taiwan at the end of the year.   Taiwan-based innovative startup PlayNitride, which was reportedly targeted by Samsung Electronics for possible acquisition, is expected to install a production line for trial production of micro-LED products in the second half of 2017, the sources indicated.   PlayNitride uses a mass transfer process that mounts micro-LED chips on TFT (thin film transistor) substrates, and the company has been exerting efforts to improve the yield rate for its RGB micro-LED displays, indicated the sources.   PlayNitride said that it is expected to team up with terminal device makers to engage in product design and development using its micro-LED technoloy in 2018, which may pave the way for mature products for applications including VR/AR, smartphone and TV devices to hit the market in 2019.   Taiwan's government-sponsored Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI), which has been developing micro-LED technology for a long time, is also expected to tie up with local businesses to begin trial production of micro LED displays in 2018, using ITRI in-house developed technology , added the sources.   The competition in the segment heated up recently after Foxconn Electronics announced that it plans to acquire display startup eLux for US$27.03 million in cash via four subsidiaries, including Sharp, for development of next-generation micro-LED display technology.   The acquisition could provide a fast track for Foxconn to commercialize micro-LED technology, commented the sources.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Goldman Sachs analyst Simona Jankowski predicts Apple will sell the 128GB and 256GB storage iPhone 8 models for US$999 (RM4,293) and US$1,099 (RM4,723), respectively.  Goldman Sachs advised investors to buy Apple shares because it says the more expensive iPhone 8 will drive earnings above expectations.  Some reports based on leaked information suggest that Apple also will release an all new version of the iPhone SE and incremental updates for an iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus.  The leaked information suggests the iPhone 8 will have a drastically reduced top and bottom bezel, glass backed chassis, the removal of the home button and a vertically aligned dual rear camera, according to Forbes.  Expectations also are that Apple will integrate the fingerprint sensor directly into the front display. — The Kansas City Star/Tribune News Service Related Stories You May Be Interested Amazon Wants You: Retail giant turns to military vets as it looks for management talent Wearable tech latest must-have for China’s proud pet owners Google targeted over child sex trafficking claims Retailers can’t move fast enough to chase shoppers online Foreign firms fret as China implements new cybersecurity law Racing for a better tomorrow Others Also Read Police carry out special exercise to test crisis response Jamming from the heart Two schools celebrate 60 years of Franco-Malaysian ties with music advertisement Latest News Jury out on North Korea link to ransomware attack Fliers’ electronics get more screening in 10-airport test Xbox adds Netflix-style videogame subscriptions China’s DJI unveils US$499 drone that flies from your hand WannaCry hits Russian postal service, exposes wider security shortcomings Most Viewed in Tech China’s DJI unveils US$499 drone that flies from your hand Hackers are now using subtitle files to take over devices WannaCry hits Russian postal service, exposes wider security shortcomings Retailers can’t move fast enough to chase shoppers online Foreign firms fret as China implements new cybersecurity law Xbox adds Netflix-style videogame subscriptions Fliers’ electronics get more screening in 10-airport test Amazon Wants You: Retail giant turns to military vets as it looks for management talent Facebook signs BuzzFeed, Vox, others for original video shows: sources Four key combinations for browsers every computer user should know Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

They include international tech titans like Google, Apple and Microsoft and Korean internet companies including Naver and NCSOFT. The rule is salient in an emerging IT industry shown in the case of the nation's top portal company Naver, which was co-founded by Lee Hae-jin and Kim Beom-su in early 2000. The small startup has since grown as the nation's dominant technology company, making Korea one of the few countries where a local firm outruns Google in the portal market. Kim later left the company and founded the nation's leading messenger, Kakao Talk. It is true that each of the business leaders from abovementioned companies has natural talent and insight to run their own businesses. But much more important was a successful teamwork and collaboration between two co-founders, according to startup industry officials on Tuesday. "Each member of a team has his or her own characteristic and maximizing the synergy between co-founders is key to turning a startup into a big company," Acciio CEO Don Yun said. Acciio is a mobile platform operator that controls different internet of things (IoT) devices in one app. Yun had been the former Kakao Lab CEO before founding the startup with two others in April last year. "Three co-founders started our business. We selected one another in a way to maximize synergies in our works," he said. "To attract venture capital, one of the most important things is how to make the most of the team spirit." D.J. Kim, vice president at the National IT Industry Promotion Agency (NIPA), concurred over the importance of how a team cares for its human resources. "There are a bunch of aspects you need to consider when doing business," said the state-run organization in charge of breeding startups. "You may need a successful engineer, but at the same time, it is of no use if you cannot promote products or platforms with aggressive marketing skills." Apple is a great example of the combination of an engineering genius and a marketing wizard — represented by Steve Wozniak and the late Steve Jobs, he said. It is widely known that Apple's global success came from Jobs' business acumen backed by unparalleled engineering skills of Wozniak. "You do not have to do everything by yourself when doing business," he said. "Finding a best partner is the key to reach success faster." Kim also called on the need to breed more multicultural startups, as the world is shrinking rapidly online. "For instance, Korean entrepreneurs with eye-catching business items can cast bigger influences on the global territory, once they team up with those from different cultural backgrounds," he said. NCSOFT, the nation's second-largest game company by market cap, also involved two entrepreneurs in its incubation. They are incumbent CEO Kim Taek-jin and Song Jae-kyung who now left the company and created another game company XL Games. Kim started the company in 1997 as a software developer focusing on internet and portal services. But with Song, also known as a legendary game developer, joining the company, NCSOFT began to reshape its identity as a game software giant. Their collaboration soon paid off with hit game "Lineage" leading to an unprecedented success in the local game industry. In the late 1990s, Kim was also renowned for his software development skills, but the company would not have brought such a fast and huge success without his teamwork with Song. In 2003, NCSOFT launched "Lineage 2," enabling the company to continue its winning streak in the global online gaming industry. Other examples There are so many great multinational high-tech companies, which made meteoric rises based on early two-way collaboration. Included in the list would be Hewlett-Packard, Microsoft and Google. Sergey Brin and Larry Page established Google in 1996 and made it a top-tier corporation not only in the info-tech business but also in the whole industries. The world's largest search engine sprawled into so many businesses including video-sharing services, operating system, smartphones, driverless automobiles and artificial intelligence (AI). In particular, Google's AlphaGo takes on human go champion of China's Ke Jie this week. It already defeated one of the best players of the ancient Asian board game last year — Korea's Lee Se-dol. This time, Google came up with a second-generation AlphaGo and it remains to be seen how well it would play, which will show the future of AI and Google. Early on in the late 1990s, Google struggled to stay alive because it lacked a business model. But it could fare well based on the teamwork of the two founders of the same age but of very different characteristics, observers say. mhlee@ktimes.comMore articles by this reporter A sad ending for deported adoptee Koreans advise how to impeach Trump Actor Kim Woo-bin diagnosed with rare cancer K-pop band SISTAR breaks up Lawmaker's 'no-look pass' has netizens boiling with anger [VIDEO] Koreans caught smuggling 2,348kg of gold in 'private parts' Ex-President denies all charges at first court hearing [VIDEO] Rain, Kim Tae-hee announce baby news S.

Instead of marketing its devices and taking sly jibes at its competitors, Apple has taken a more direct route to convince Android users to switch to iPhone. The iPhone maker launched a website on Monday aimed at persuading people who currently have an Android phone to buy an iPhone. When you enter the website you are faced with a question: “Will it be easy to switch to iPhone?” iPhone 8 might cost you as much as a MacBook Followed by Apple’s reply: “Yes, it will. There’s no need to save your stuff elsewhere before switching from Android. Just download the Move to iOS app from the Google Play Store and it securely transfers your content for you.” Apple has been focusing on luring Android users towards their iPhone with Apple CEO Tim Cook using statistics about the number of “switchers” from Android to iPhone, as a significant portion of their data. “We saw the largest absolute number of switchers outside of greater China that we’ve ever seen in the same period,” Cook said on the company’s latest earnings call, according to MacRumors.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Smartphones How to speed up an iPhone in 7 easy ways Here are seven tips to get rid of sluggish performance and reduced battery life on your iPhone. Vinod Yalburgi   May 24, 2017 18:02 IST Here's how to speed up an iPhone in seven easy ways Apple iPhone tends to become sluggish as its main memory and storage fills up over long periods of usage. You will know if your phone is sluggish or extremely slow in response, when apps take longer than usual to open and there is a general sense of lag experienced while browsing. International Business Times, India explores a few nifty ways to speed up your ageing smartphone and make it feel new again. The sluggishness of your iPhone could depend on various other factors like an outdated iOS firmware or some of your apps may require an update. Upgrade iOS and update apps If your iPhone model is supported on iOS 10, you should definitely install it by navigating to Settings > General > Software Update. Ensure you have the latest version of iOS 10 installed, which is iOS 10.3.1. Note: You can repeat the same steps for installing iOS 9 updates on older smartphones. If there no updates listed in the Software Update section then your phone is already up-to-date. After you have upgraded the operating system, it is time to check for the latest app updates from the respective developer sites. Latest iOS and App updates will ensure that you do not end up with compatibility and performance issues. Clear the RAM aka system memory Your phone's RAM (random access memory) could fill up quickly as you perform various tasks such as installing or uninstalling apps, surfing the internet or just working with the apps. Furthermore, each app requires some memory for it to keep running. There is no way to limit the amount of RAM allocated to each app and hence it becomes imperative to refresh or wipe out the contents of system memory as often as you can. This is especially important as some apps keep background processes running even after you have quit the app. Here's how to clear your iPhone's system memory: Press and Hold the iPhone power button until you see the "Slide to power off" prompt on screen. Now release the power button, press and hold down the Home button for around five seconds. Wait until the Home screen boots up and the RAM will get refreshed. Your iPhone should now be faster than before. Clear the apps' cache memory files Cache memory files temporarily store data of your app until the next reboot or respiring to facilitate faster app launching times. As the cache memory fills up over time, your app response time increases as the buffering process slows down. Here's how to clear the cache for all pre-installed aka native apps from Apple: Open any pre-installed app like iTunes, Apple Music, Game Center or iMessage. Go to the tab bar of any of these apps and hit one of the app buttons repeatedly for ten times. Now the app will flash white and its cache will be cleared. Kill background processes If your iPhone is still struggling to keep up pace after clearing the RAM and cache memory files, then it is time to manually disable background app refresh or kill background processes permanently. Note: This feature is limited to iOS 7 and later versions. It is not available on iOS 6. Here's what you should do: Tap Settings > General > Background App Refresh and toggle the switch off. After doing this you should notice considerable boost in battery life and overall system performance. Clear all iMessages Accumulating tons of incoming messages in your iMessage app could massively slow down your phone, besides taking up a large chunk of space on your phone's internal storage. Just go to Settings > General > Storage and iCloud Usage and tap Manage Storage. Here you can see how much space can be freed on your phone. Go ahead and manually delete all the messages you have read. To prevent such accumulation of messages in future, you can enable the automatic setting to delete messages after some stipulated amount of time. Here's how to do it: Navigate to Settings > Messages > Keep Messages Now, select 30 days or 1 year depending on how long you want to keep them. Once it is set, all the messages that are older than the specified timeframe will be deleted automatically and thereby offers a considerable speed boost to your iPhone. Turn off animations Animations or Parallax effects can make the visuals on your iPhone appealing, but it does drain your memory and processor resources every time you open an app and thereby it does slow down your phone drastically. You could do away with animations to improve performance of your iPhone. Here's what you should do: Navigate to Settings > General > Accessibility and enable 'Reduce Motion' option. This will reduce the transition or Parallax effects and the drain on system resources including battery, will be minimal. If nothing else works, as a last resort you can try resetting your iPhone to factory settings. Resetting your iPhone Unlike a restart which will only refresh the system memory, a full reset will restore the factory aka default settings on your phone. This should help resolve sluggishness and other performance issues. Here's how you can reset your iPhone: Press and hold Home and Sleep/Power buttons together until the device reboots to the Apple logo screen. Now release both the buttons and your phone will be reset.

Even before this, the companies had been involved in legal battles relating to patent technology between 2009 and 2011, reported BBC. But now, the two companies have agreed to settle their dispute and work together for a few future projects. The deal between the companies has led to Apple using Nokia's technology in return of deserved cash payment. Apple will now be able to stock health products being produced by Nokia in their retail stores, under the agreement. No financial detail has been disclosed by either company, while market experts have speculated a deal worth millions of dollars. Both the companies have shown solidarity with each other over the matter with Nokia's Chief Legal Officer Maria Varsellona saying that the agreement "moves our relationship with Apple from being adversaries in court to business partners It moves our relationship with Apple from being adversaries in court to business partners working for the benefit of our customers", while Apple's Jeff Williams said they are "pleased with this resolution of our dispute". To continue their "network infrastructure" products, the companies have also decided to organise summits on a regular basis and continue the cooperation. Varsellona also added, "This is a meaningful agreement between Nokia and Apple." While the agreement has benefited Apple with the legal use of patent technology, Nokia experienced the highest share price level in three years after the news of agreement broke out. The company's shares rose around 8%. Even Apple experienced 0.61% higher share price on Tuesday. Related Apple vs Imagination Technologies: Legal dispute looms over possible patent violation?

Apple’s recent weakness in China has largely been due to iPhone. During the Q2 17 earnings call, Apple spoke of 20% revenue growth for Mac and “double-digit growth” for Services in Greater China, which suggests that iPhone + iPad revenue must have declined at least double digits at constant currency. Third party market research (IDC) corroborates that Apple’s >$500 ASP smartphone units declined >20% in each of the past 5 quarters in Mainland China. The Oppenheimer report of course references the famed ability of Steve Jobs to hype new products and insist that engineers do things they’ve told him couldn’t be done. While most analysts expect the iPhone 8 to create a ‘super-cycle‘ similar to or exceeding that of the iPhone 6, where both existing iPhone owners and Android users alike buy the phones in record numbers, Oppenheimer analyst Andrew Uerkwitz is less optimistic. We recently conducted a series of company meetings in China and Taiwan that focused on the smartphone supply chain. There was general consensus among our conversations that confirms our thesis that Apple’s dwindling market share in Greater China is due to the lack of compelling differentiation among hardware and software. The mobile user experience in China is heavily dictated by Tencent and other local Internet companies, making Apple’s software and services ineffective as key differentiators. That said, we do believe there is pent-up demand for iPhone 8, which is widely reported to make a few major design changes. We expect a temporary rebound in share. China is a very different market for Apple, thanks not only to strong competition from local brands, but also the importance of the WeChat platform. This allows many functions to be carried out from within the app, making the draw of Apple’s ecosystem less powerful.

Apple has filed an application to test next-generation wireless technologies, often called "5G," that could potentially radically increase the speed and bandwidth of a cellular connection. An application for an experimental license to use new wireless technology, called millimeter wave, was signed on Tuesday by Apple and made public by the FCC.  Popular Searches Toyota Motor Corp TM ▼ 107.32 -0.76 -0.70% Nissan Motor Co Ltd NSANY ▼ 19.28 -0.20 -1.03% Moody's Corporation MCO ▲ 115.05 +0.16 +0.14% Steelcase Inc SCS ▲ 16.80 +0.20 +1.20% "Apple Inc. seeks to assess cellular link performance in direct path and multipath environments between base station transmitters and receivers using this spectrum," Apple wrote in its application. "These assessments will provide engineering data relevant to the operation of devices on wireless carriers’ future 5G networks," it continued.  Apple will test these technologies at two locations, according to the application: One in Milpitas, California, on Yosemite Drive, and one on Mariana Avenue that was originally Apple's first headquarters, and is adjacent to its current headquarters at 1 Infinite Loop.  From the application:  Apple intends to transmit from two fixed points located at Apple-controlled facilities in Cupertino and Milpitas, CA. These transmissions will be consistent with the parameters and equipment identified in Apple’s accompanying Form 442, and will include the use of a horn antenna with a half-power beamwidth of 20 degrees in the E-plane and H-plane and a downtilt between 20 - 25 degrees. Apple anticipates that it will conduct its experiments for a period not to exceed 12 months. The Apple application specifically mentions the 28 and 39 GHz bands, which the FCC approved for commercial use for 5G applications last year. The experiments will use technology manufactured by Rohde & Schwarz, A.H. Systems, and Analog Devices. Load Error The application lists Mark Neumann, a regulatory engineer, as its primary contact.  One of the biggest promises of "5G" or millimeter wave technology is that when it is ubiquitous, latency will go down, allowing devices to access more bandwidth more reliably than is currently possible with cellular networks.  However, it's unclear what Apple's intention for these two testing sites is, and Apple has not been publicly connected to 5G research or experimentation before.  One of the bands that Apple intends to test, 28GHz, is allocated for earth-to-space transmissions, according to part of the application. Bloomberg reported last month that Apple formed a new hardware team filled with people who have experience with spacecraft and satellite design.   Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

The curriculum is available as a free download today from Apple's iBooks Store.   App Development with Swift is a full-year course designed by Apple engineers and educators to teach students elements of app design using Swift, one of the world's most popular programming languages. Students will learn to code and design fully functional apps, gaining critical job skills in software development and information technology.   Starting this fall, six community college systems serving nearly 500,000 students across the country will be among the first to offer the innovative curriculum. At many campuses, local businesses will also offer students mentoring and internships.   "We've seen firsthand the impact that coding has on individuals and the US economy as a whole. The app economy and software development are among the fastest-growing job sectors in America and we're thrilled to be providing educators and students with the tools to learn coding," said Tim Cook, Apple's CEO. "Community colleges play a critical role in helping students achieve their dreams, and we hope these courses will open doors for people of all ages and backgrounds to pursue what they love."     The curriculum will be offered by the Alabama Community College System, Columbus State Community College, Harrisburg Area Community College, Houston Community College, Mesa Community College and San Mateo Community College District, among others. Select high schools across the country will also be teaching the App Development with Swift curriculum starting this fall. Houston Community College is opening an iOS Coding and Design School that will teach Apple's new curriculum.   "The world calls Houston a knowledge capital because of the incredible concentration of ideas and innovation in our great city," said Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner. "Apple's investment in our community with the launch of the app development curriculum will tap into the creativity of our students, inspire new possibilities and foster our culture of technological transformation."   "We are focused on preparing our students for life in a global and technological society, and in 2017 that means making sure our students have access to a state-of-the-art coding curriculum," said Houston Community College Chancellor Cesar Maldonado. "We are thrilled Apple is offering this incredible opportunity to advance student learning, which will especially help us bridge the gap in computer science training for minorities and women. We can't wait to see what these students will do and already have local businesses offering mentoring and internship opportunities."   App Development with Swift is an extension of Apple's existing K-12 Everyone Can Code curricula which offer everyone the power to learn, write and teach coding. Swift is Apple's powerful and intuitive programming language that gives developers the freedom and capabilities they need to create the next generation of cutting-edge software. Popular apps including Airbnb, KAYAK, TripAdvisor, Venmo and Yelp are all created with Swift. In addition to over 1 million downloads of Swift Playgrounds, there have been over 430,000 downloads of the additional Everyone Can Code materials and over 1,000 schools across the US plan to teach with Everyone Can Code materials in the fall.   Earlier this month, Apple announced the creation of the Advanced Manufacturing Fund focused on creating jobs in the US throughout our supply chain, with an initial investment of $1 billion. The new Swift coding curriculum is another example of Apple's commitment to economic development and will help create even more career opportunities for students across the country. Apple now supports 2 million jobs across all 50 states, including more than 1.5 million jobs attributable to Apple's app economy.     About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

 China is Apple's biggest problem right now Jim Edwards May 24, 2017, 7:16 AM 2,462 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple CEO Tim Cook at the China Development Forum in Beijing, China, March 18, 2017. REUTERS/Thomas Peter China generates 25% of all Apple's profits and is the company's second-largest market. Over time it's expected to eventually become the company's single biggest market. But China is also Apple's biggest problem right now. The company is in freefall in China, with declining sales and loss of market share to local smartphone competitors like Huawei, OPPO, and Vivo. The iPhone has only a 14% share of the China market, according to research firm Gartner. According to Bernstein analysts Toni Sacconaghi Jr. and Daniel Chen, iPhone sales have dropped 20% in China. "Apple's recent weakness in China has largely been due to iPhone. During the Q2 17 earnings call, Apple spoke of 20% revenue growth for Mac and "double-digit growth" for Services in Greater China, which suggests that iPhone + iPad revenue must have declined at least double digits at constant currency. Third party market research (IDC) corroborates that Apple's >$500 ASP smartphone units declined >20% in each of the past 5 quarters in Mainland China," the pair wrote in a recent note to clients. "A key question for Apple's stock is, 'What is happening in China?'" they wrote. The analysts at Longbow Research and Oppenheimer agree. Apple's "Reality Distortion Field" is "fading" in China, the Oppenheimer team told their clients. (The phrase "reality distortion field" is a reference to Apple founder Steve Jobs' legendary ability to persuade people around him to believe things that might not be true.)  Here's a chart from BI Intelligence showing the problem. While sales growth has stumbled worldwide, the problem in China is at least twice as bad as any other market: BI Intelligence There are two possible explanations for this, one that is essentially positive for Apple and one that is not. The upside explanation is that Chinese consumers are much more driven by new products, and they have held off from buying the iPhone 6s and iPhone 7 models because they were too similar to iPhone 6, which was a huge hit in China. In this scenario, Chinese sales will likely increase again if the upcoming iPhone 8 is sufficiently new and exciting. Apple has a big installed base of legacy users, and they will drive a big replacement cycle in the fourth quarter of this calendar year. The other scenario comes from Oppenheimer analyst Andrew Uerkwitz and his team. In a note titled "Fading 'Reality Distortion Field,'" they said the unique dominance of certain Chinese apps hurts Apple. Those apps are fully functional on Android, which dominates China, but not on iPhone. Apple doesn't allow Tencent users to use the tipping function inside WeChat, for instance. That won't sound like a big deal to people in the West, but in China apps like WeChat are used almost ubiquitously. It has 1 billion users. The Oppenheimer note — based on conversations with Apple's own suppliers — says: "We recently conducted a series of company meetings in China and Taiwan that focused on the smartphone supply chain. There was general consensus among our conversations that confirms our thesis that Apple's dwindling market share in Greater China is due to the lack of compelling differentiation among hardware and software. The mobile user experience in China is heavily dictated by Tencent and other local Internet companies, making Apple's software and services ineffective as key differentiators. That said, we do believe there is pent-up demand for iPhone 8, which is widely reported to make a few major design changes. We expect a temporary rebound in share."

Faster, more stable, capable of supporting more devices and equipped to handle life in the fast lane, 5G technology is the next wave of networking, and Apple is deeply involved in testing and developing the standard. What does Apple hope to gain and why should this matter to an iOS enterprise? What is 5G?          While it is important to note that 5G is not yet ratified as a standard and networks that use the standard aren’t expected before 2020, 5G is touted as the next-generation of wireless broadband.   The GSMA has set some criteria, most of which need to be met for a network to call itself ‘5G’. They include 1-10Gbps connections to devices and other end points and the capacity to support up to 100 times as many devices per cell as possible in current implementations. To be incredibly simplistic, 5G should be able to download entire movies in second, will enable high-bandwidth computations, such as gaming, and will be capable of supporting the billions of connected devices expected to be in use by 2025. One more thing: 5G will also be much more stable when used in moving vehicles, such as trains, public transport, and (of course) cars. What is Apple doing? Apple recently applied for FCC permission to test a new wireless technology, called millimeter wave. The company intends testing transmissions using the standard between two fixed points in Cupertino and Milpitas, CA. "These assessments will provide engineering data relevant to the operation of devices on wireless carriers’ future 5G networks,” its application said. That’s not the only way in which Apple is involved in 5G development. Way back in 2014 the company joined the Next Generation Mobile Networks (NGMN) Alliance, an association of stakeholders from within the industry working to ensure next-gen networks, infrastructure, and devices are compliant. Light Reading last year reported Apple to be hiring at least one engineer with knowledge and experience of “radar signal processing”, which basically means the signals which are used in millimeter wave. Millimeter wave is the band of spectrum between 30GHz and 300GHz which is ear-marked for use by 5G networks. Why is Apple doing this? The reasons for Apple’s interest are pretty obvious: not only must the company ensure its mobile products play nice with the 5G standard once it appears, it also seems likely the company understands the strategic value of gaining an early mover advantage once carrier deployments of 5G make hardware products viable. That means Apple doesn’t need to be first to market, but will want to hit the market soon after 5G is made available in key markets: U.S., China, India, Europe, potentially the UK. The capacity to handle high bandwidth activity with low latency and support for billions of devices is alluring enough, but stability in moving vehicles has obvious implications. These 5G stalwarts mean the standard will be able to handle things like mobile virtual and augmented reality services, vehicle-to-vehicle communications systems, and will have pipes plenty big enough to handle the vastly complex data exchange demands of unstructured machine intelligence analytics. We know Apple has interest in all of these sectors. (We also know Apple is now working far more closely with Nokia, which holds so much network knowledge). How does this impact my business? Consumers should benefit from fast and reliable access to the kinds of services they use their home broadband connection to access today. It doesn’t end there, of course – they can also look forward to next-generation services (such as mobile VR) and solutions we’ve not imagined yet. Provision of powerful mobile broadband also has implications on the Internet-of-things (IoT), as 5G will provide the capacity to support billions of devices without generating undue interference on existing data traffic. That’s the consumer: Beyond the opportunity to provide new breeds of next-generation service to consumers, business users should benefit from: Ultra-fast unified communications The capacity to provide truly wireless cloud-based office solutions Opportunities to expand using mobile VR Improvements in business agility – you can use 5G as a primary fixed-line broadband replacement, enabling enterprises to “pop-up” whole offices in response to immediate business need. However, the enterprise opportunity of 5G isn’t going to manifest itself until full-scale commercial deployments of the standard begin around 2020. That’s good for IT purchasers looking to extend their Apple deployment, as it means mobile products purchased in the current equipment upgrade cycle (2017-18) will likely be due for replacement by the time the standard appears. This means those C-class execs will likely get their wish in the form of an iPhone 8 when this ships later this year, as even though Apple is evidently working to develop a 5G iPhone, there’s no need to plan for its appearance… yet.

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) By Paul Gattis pgattis@al.com Apple on Wednesday is launching a new app development educational curriculum to aid students interested in pursuing careers in the app economy. And the curriculum has a specific connection to Alabama. Apple is working with six community college systems across the country - including Alabama - to roll out the app curriculum. The program will be available to students at Drake State in Huntsville, Wallace State in Selma and Bishop State in Mobile. Apple officials said they hope the program grows beyond those three campuses. "Apple has been 40 years working in the education space," said Lisa Jackson, Apple vice president for environment, policy and social initiatives. "For us, we knew we wanted to take the curriculum all the way up to the high school/community college level. "So when we got the curriculum developed and we did that with a number of educators, many of them put up their hand and said they were willing to roll it out into their existing programs and teach with the curriculum in the fall. We think part of the reason is it was developed with them in mind." Apple said its new Swift coding curriculum will help create jobs for students across the country. It's an extension of Apple's K-12 Everyone Can Code program that provides fundamentals in learning, writing and teaching coding. Apple now has a curriculum path from kindergarten through the first two years of college. "We're very excited," Jackson said. "This is a pretty important moment when we set out years ago to develop a whole new programming language - and that's what this is, it's language for app developers by people who invented the App Store - we envisioned that we wanted to reach folks starting in kindergarten and all the way through middle school, which is what our Swift playground app does. "We knew we didn't want to stop there. it was about workforce development and skills needed for the workforce in the future." The free curriculum is available for download from Apple's iBooks Store.

Get your salt at the ready, we have a rather meaty iPhone 8 rumour for you: according to multiple sources, Apple will NOT release the iPhone 8 inside 2017. That’s right: no iPhone 8 – just the boring old iPhone 7s. Sources say Apple is experiencing A LOT of issues getting the iPhone 8 built in the desired numbers. "UBS analyst Steven Milunovich believes the iPhone 8 will start at $870, and an upgraded model with 256GB of space in this scenario would cost $1,070," reports Business Insider. "Currently," it added, "Apple charges $649 or more for an iPhone 7, and the iPhone 7 Plus costs $769 and up. Some analysts have previously entertained the possibility that the iPhone 8 could cost $1,000 or more, but under Milunovich's assumptions, that would be the high-end price, not the starting price." Production woes had already pushed back the release of the handset by a couple of months, around November-time, according to BGR, but that date has now been further delayed with the news that it might not even get a release inside 2017. “Report suggests no new iPhone 8 this calendar year,” wrote analysts at Deutsche Bank. “As we have written in previous [research notes], several supply chain reports have suggested that key component shortages and technical challenges could delay the release of a high-end iPhone 8 device this fall. We believe this report further underscores the uncertainty around the timing of Apple’s next- generation iPhone model.” On the complete OPPOSITE end of the spectrum, however, is the news that Apple’s iPhone 8 could actually launch at WWDC 2017 – in just under a month’s time. At the same time, TrendForce has published a report regarding the iPhones which WILL arrive in 2017, suggesting that this year's models will not pack 4GB of RAM, instead Apple will go for 3.2GB. However, the analysis does differ somewhat from DeutscheBank, in the sense that TrendForce believes the iPhone 8 with OLED will also pack 3.2GB RAM and that users shouldn't expect 4GB RAM until 2018; that suggests the firm still expects the iPhone 8 to arrive this year. The latest whispers on May 8 fall on the side of claiming there's NO DELAY AT ALL for the iPhone 8 and that it will arrive during September 2017, alongside the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus. That's according to DigiTimes, which cites China's Economic Daily News; it says that the iPhone 8 mass production is on schedule. There won't be a delay, it suggests, and Apple will reveal the iPhone 8 in September 2017 with a view to it hitting the market by October. "Upstream to downstream suppliers in the iPhone supply chains, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), SLP (substrate-like PCB) makers Zhen Ding Technology and Kinsus Interconnect Technology, and battery supplier Simplo Technology, are ready to ramp up related iPhone parts starting June. TSMC will begin to fabricate the wafer starts needed for the production of A11 processors on June 10 and to deliver the chips in volume quantity in the second half of July, the report indicated." Basically, it's anyone's guess what's going on at the moment but a September launch and release, as originally expected, now sounds likely.  "The report defied previous speculations that volume production of new iPhone devices would be delayed to the fourth quarter of 2017 instead of the original schedule in August-September due to yield rate issues on production of some parts," said DigiTimes. "iPhone assemblers Foxconn Electronics, Winstron and Pegatron are accelerating the recruitment and training of new workers in China in preparation of mass production of the new iPhone," it added. As I said earlier, it’s silly season for iPhone rumours. Everybody’s trying to get in on the action.  Apple will have plenty of company during Q4 as well with new, key releases from Samsung – with the Galaxy Note 8 –, Motorola, Google and HTC. Analysts are still being very bullish about the iPhone 8, however, suggesting Apple could sell more than 100 million units inside Q4 alone.   Never before has Apple’s upcoming phone launch been so mysterious; we know there will be three new phones – at some point – but we do not know when they will arrive (or in what order). Personally, I believe all three phones will be announced at the same time, though the more expensive iPhone 8 release date will be delayed. This seems like the most logical approach, as two phone launches within a month or one another does not make any sense. Nor does holding off until April or the end of Q1 2018. How Apple handles this will be incredibly important, as demand for a redesigned iPhone is at an all time high. Competition is also very strong too with solid releases from Samsung and more to come from both Samsung and Google and OnePlus later on this year. I think ALL iPhones will be announced during the September keynote, but the iPhone 8 will not get a release until November. This will allow Apple to sort out its issues, debut all of its new innovations and sell some iPhone 7s handsets in the interim. The iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus are apparently on track for a release in the usual block, though I cannot see too many people getting excited by these handsets when the prospect of the iPhone 8 has been dangled in front of their noses for the past six months. Obviously, nothing said in these reports is gospel; you need to take these things with a pinch of salt. Disinformation is everywhere, not just in politics, and you have to factor in Tim Cook’s recent comments too; the CEO blamed leaks about the iPhone 8 on declining iPhone sales during this past quarter. Could Mr. Cook be trying to reignite demand for Apple’s current iPhones by chucking a cheeky little rumour about iPhone 8 delays out there? Probably not – but it’s an interesting idea all the same! Personally, I do not see Apple missing this opportunity. Hype around the iPhone 8 is at an all time high; there’s no way Cook and The Boys are going to miss out on this. Even if the release is delayed by a month or two, the handset will almost certainly be launched alongside the iPhone 7s range.

Apple had initially sought a 15 year tax holiday. The Indian government has reportedly offered tax concessions to Apple on importing components that are required for local manufacturing. Apple is also reported to have agreed to increase the local share in production over a period of time.   Reuters quotes Ravi Shankar Prasad, Union Minister for Electronics and IT, as a saying that Apple wants to expand one of its contract manufacturer’s facility in the Indian tech hub of Bengaluru. Apple was earlier reported to have finished the trial assembly of the iPhone SE and the company was said to begin shipping of ‘the Indian-made devices to domestic customers this month’. For those who are not aware, Wistron Apple’s original design manufacturer who will operate Apple's first facility set up in Peenya, West Bengaluru.   “We have offered them tax exemptions on those components which could not be manufactured in India,” Aruna Sundararajan, Secretary at the Ministry of Electronics and IT said to Reuters. Apple has earlier asked for various concessions including a 15-year custom holiday on iPhone kits imports and other tax incentives to enter the manufacturing sector in India. However, a panel of ministries rejected the demand stating that will not be feasible and fair to other handset manufacturers in India which have been following the norm without any extra privileges.   It is expected that, Apple manufacturing iPhones in India will surely result in price revision even without any special tax exemptions. The current customs duty imposed on smartphones is about 12.5 percent which, if removed, will dip the price by Rs 10,000. Also, we can expect Apple to start selling Make-in-India iPhones sometime by end of this year.

 Apple is working on a technology that will increase the iPhone's internet speeds Kif Leswing May 23, 2017, 3:59 PM 24,960 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple CEO Tim Cook looks up to the skies.Reuters Apple is testing next-generation wireless technologies, often called "5G," that could potentially radically increase the speed and bandwidth of an iPhone's cellular connection. An application for an experimental license to use new wireless technology, called millimeter wave, was signed on Tuesday by Apple and made public by the FCC.  "Apple Inc. seeks to assess cellular link performance in direct path and multipath environments between base station transmitters and receivers using this spectrum," according to the application. "These assessments will provide engineering data relevant to the operation of devices on wireless carriers’ future 5G networks," it continued.  Apple will test these technologies at two locations, according to the application: One in Milpitas, California, on Yosemite Drive, and one on Mariani Avenue that was originally Apple's first headquarters, and is adjacent to its current headquarters at 1 Infinite Loop.  From the application:  Apple intends to transmit from two fixed points located at Apple-controlled facilities in Cupertino and Milpitas, CA. These transmissions will be consistent with the parameters and equipment identified in Apple’s accompanying Form 442, and will include the use of a horn antenna with a half-power beamwidth of 20 degrees in the E-plane and H-plane and a downtilt between 20 - 25 degrees. Apple anticipates that it will conduct its experiments for a period not to exceed 12 months. The Apple application specifically mentions the 28 and 39 GHz bands, which the FCC approved for commercial use for 5G applications last year. The experiments will use technology manufactured by Rohde & Schwarz, A.H. Systems, and Analog Devices. The application lists Mark Neumann, a regulatory engineer, as its primary contact.  One of the biggest promises of "5G" or millimeter wave technology is that when it is ubiquitous, latency will go down, allowing devices to access more bandwidth more reliably than is currently possible with cellular networks.  However, it's unclear what Apple's intention for these two testing sites is, and Apple has not been publicly connected to 5G research or experimentation before, although it did recently join an industry group for 5G development.  One of the bands that Apple intends to test, 28GHz, is allocated for earth-to-space transmissions, according to part of the application. Bloomberg reported last month that Apple formed a new hardware team filled with people who have experience with spacecraft and satellite design.   The filing comes as Apple is in a legal dispute with its current supplier for wireless chips, Qualcomm, over licensing fees. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  EXCLUSIVE FREE REPORT: 25 Big Tech Predictions by BI Intelligence.

International Business Times UK UK World Business Politics Fintech Technology Science Sport Entertainment Opinion Video Pictures Log out Newsletter Signup Smartphones Cybersecurity Innovation Social Media Games Motoring Technology Smartphones Somehow, the iPhone 9 rumours have already begun A full 16 months away and the iPhone 9 rumours have already begun to trickle out of South Korea. By Alistair Charlton May 24, 2017 11:41 BST An Apple logo, because we still have literally no idea what the iPhone 9 will look likeReuters The iPhone 8 is still at least four months away, but that doesn't mean the cogs of the iPhone 9 rumour mills can't start to turn. A report stemming from Korea and published by The Investor, a division of the Korea Herald, claims Apple and Samsung Display have already signed an agreement for the latter to produce displays of two different sizes for the iPhone 9, which is unlikely to arrive until at least September 2018. The sizes are claimed to be 5.23in and 6.46in, significantly larger than the 4.7in iPhone 7 and 5.5in iPhone 7 Plus on sale today. Additionally, the report claims the two displays will use OLED (organic light emitting diode) technology, which has been used in Samsung's own smartphones for some time and is expected to debut on an Apple handset with the iPhone 8 later this year. But the early nature of this rumour has made it difficult to take seriously, even among Apple's most dedicated fans. "iPhone 15 will be shaped like a flying saucer and be branded the iPhone Cupertino," said one member of the MacRumors forum. "Really really, iPhone 9, come on enough is enough" another added. Samsung Display is a subsidiary of Samsung Electronics, which manufactures the Samsung Galaxy S8, Apple's closest smartphone rival. As used by the S8, OLED displays can produce more vibrant colours and darker blacks than the LCD screens currently used by Apple. The report quotes an unnamed industry source as saying: "The two companies have recently signed a non-disclosure agreement on general conditions, including screen size... Other details such as screen design and functions could be adjusted considering the phone is still under development." Apple is expected to release three new iPhones later in 2017, called the iPhone 7S, 7S Plus and a new model currently dubbed the iPhone 8. This third phone is tipped to be more expensive than ever and feature a display which almost entirely covers the front of the handset, like that of the Galaxy S8. But unlike the S8, Apple will allegedly embed the Touch ID fingerprint reader into the screen, instead of fitting it awkwardly to the back. A third MacRumors regular summed things up nicely. "Dear God, can't we at least get to the announcement of the iPhone 8 by Apple before moving onto the next one? The back and forth rumours this year are getting to me more than ever. I need to step away." Don't we all.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 24 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Apple Launches App Development Curriculum for High School & Community College Students HOUSTON–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Apple® today launched a new app development curriculum designed for students who want to pursue careers in the fast-growing app economy. The curriculum is available as a free download today from Apple’s iBooks Store℠. App Development with Swift is a full-year course designed by Apple engineers and educators to teach students elements of app design using Swift™, one of the world’s most popular programming languages. Students will learn to code and design fully functional apps, gaining critical job skills in software development and information technology. Starting this fall, six community college systems serving nearly 500,000 students across the country will be among the first to offer the innovative curriculum. At many campuses, local businesses will also offer students mentoring and internships. “We’ve seen firsthand the impact that coding has on individuals and the US economy as a whole. The app economy and software development are among the fastest-growing job sectors in America and we’re thrilled to be providing educators and students with the tools to learn coding,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “Community colleges play a critical role in helping students achieve their dreams, and we hope these courses will open doors for people of all ages and backgrounds to pursue what they love.” The curriculum will be offered by the Alabama Community College System, Columbus State Community College, Harrisburg Area Community College, Houston Community College, Mesa Community College and San Mateo Community College District, among others. Select high schools across the country will also be teaching the App Development with Swift curriculum starting this fall. Houston Community College is opening an iOS Coding and Design School that will teach Apple’s new curriculum. “The world calls Houston a knowledge capital because of the incredible concentration of ideas and innovation in our great city,” said Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner. “Apple’s investment in our community with the launch of the app development curriculum will tap into the creativity of our students, inspire new possibilities and foster our culture of technological transformation.” “We are focused on preparing our students for life in a global and technological society, and in 2017 that means making sure our students have access to a state-of-the-art coding curriculum,” said Houston Community College Chancellor Cesar Maldonado. “We are thrilled Apple is offering this incredible opportunity to advance student learning, which will especially help us bridge the gap in computer science training for minorities and women. We can’t wait to see what these students will do and already have local businesses offering mentoring and internship opportunities.” App Development with Swift is an extension of Apple’s existing K-12 Everyone Can Code curricula which offer everyone the power to learn, write and teach coding. Swift is Apple’s powerful and intuitive programming language that gives developers the freedom and capabilities they need to create the next generation of cutting-edge software. Popular apps including Airbnb, KAYAK, TripAdvisor, Venmo and Yelp are all created with Swift. In addition to over 1 million downloads of Swift Playgrounds™, there have been over 430,000 downloads of the additional Everyone Can Code materials and over 1,000 schools across the US plan to teach with Everyone Can Code materials in the fall. Earlier this month, Apple announced the creation of the Advanced Manufacturing Fund focused on creating jobs in the US throughout our supply chain, with an initial investment of $1 billion. The new Swift coding curriculum is another example of Apple’s commitment to economic development and will help create even more career opportunities for students across the country. Apple now supports 2 million jobs across all 50 states, including more than 1.5 million jobs attributable to Apple’s app economy. Apple revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984. Today, Apple leads the world in innovation with iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV. Apple’s four software platforms — iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS — provide seamless experiences across all Apple devices and empower people with breakthrough services including the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay and iCloud. Apple’s more than 100,000 employees are dedicated to making the best products on earth, and to leaving the world better than we found it.

The curriculum can be accessed by anyone as a free download from Apple’s iBooks Store. The lessons are aimed at developing skills in Apple’s Swift programming language, and the company said the course is “designed for students who want to pursue careers in the fast-growing app economy.” While anyone can access the guide, Apple said six community college systems will start incorporating the app development curriculum with their other classes. “We’ve seen firsthand the impact that coding has on individuals and the U.S. economy as a whole. The app economy and software development are among the fastest-growing job sectors in America, and we’re thrilled to be providing educators and students with the tools to learn coding,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO, in a statement. “Community colleges play a critical role in helping students achieve their dreams, and we hope these courses will open doors for people of all ages and backgrounds to pursue what they love.” Those schools are: Alabama Community College System Columbus State Community College Harrisburg Area Community College Houston Community College, Mesa Community College San Mateo Community College Several high schools will also teach app development, Apple said. And Houston Community College is actually opening an iOS Coding and Design School to offer the curriculum. The new program comes a few weeks after Apple announced its new Advanced Manufacturing Fund, which promises to spend $1 billion on new manufacturing initiatives. In its press release, Apple, which was criticized by Trump during his campaign for outsourcing manufacturing of products, emphasized the company’s positive economic impact: “The new Swift coding curriculum is another example of Apple’s commitment to economic development and will help create even more career opportunities for students across the country.

By Christine Vendel cvendel@pennlive.com Apple is rolling out a new yearlong curriculum to teach college students how to design and code their own apps. And Harrisburg has been chosen as one of a handful of exclusive sites across the country to host the program. Apple announced early Wednesday that the company had selected Harrisburg Area Community College as one of six community colleges to roll out the new 180-hour curriculum for app development that will help students gain critical skills for jobs that didn't exist just a few years ago. The college is expected to launch courses in the fall as part of HACC's noncredit workforce development courses. The program could expand into credit- bearing courses next spring. The courses are designed to start at the very beginning, for students with no programming experience. The curriculum also will be offered free to the public on Apple's iBooks store starting Wednesday May, 24. The partnership between Apple and HACC represents just the most recent in a series. Back in 2012, HACC was one of six colleges asked to produce college courses that could be delivered online through the new iTunes U. The other schools associated with that launch were Duke, Yale and MIT. HACC then was approved to open an Apple campus store on site, where the college was licensed to sell Apple electronics to students and staff. The store isn't authorized to sell iPads and laptops to the public, but it can sell accessories to the public. The school also has a licensed Apple repair shop known as HawkTech, featuring Apple-trained technicians, where the public can bring electronics for repair instead of driving to the next nearest repair site: the Apple store in Lancaster. Harrisburg was selected as a partner because of Apple's longstanding relationship with the school, said Lisa Jackson, a vice president at Apple, who spoke to PennLive. As one of the first-adopters of the curriculum, Jackson said, Apple will support HACC and accept feedback to improve the curriculum. The courses were created like all Apple products, to be intuitive and easy to understand. While Harrisburg may seem an unlikely choice for a close partnership with Apple, the college has drawn attention for its early embrace of cutting-edge technology with its popular podcasts starting back in 2006. "Our faculty embraced it so much, and we had so many people listening, I think it caught people's attention," said Amy Withrow, HACC's executive director of Virtual Learning. "I think there is so much potential in the realm of coding and it's exciting to see more and more people get interested in that." More than ten years ago, the word "app" may have been mostly recognized as an abbreviation for appetizer. But now, people from all walks of life regularly download apps to their their mobile phones to do everything from playing games to finding a parking space downtown. As part of the app development course, students will learn the language of Swift, a new programming language created by Apple that has been used to create many popular apps from Airbnb to TripAdvisor. The new courses are designed so students can pursue careers in the fast-growing app economy and develop other computer skills that could help land them jobs. The post-secondary curriculum adds onto previous free courses by Apple offered online starting from kindergarten. The other community colleges participating in the new app development curriculum are: Houston College System, Alabama Community College System, Columbus State Community College, Mesa Community College and San Mateo Community College District. Since Apple's App Store began in July 2008, Apple has paid out more than $50 to app developers, including $16 billion for U.S. developers. The free curriculum and partnership with community colleges is intended to grow more computer-career opportunities in the United States, according to Apple officials.

Apple targets community college students with new a Swift coding course Posted 21 hours ago by Brian Heater (@bheater) 0 SHARES Next Story Naspers pours $5M into Coins, a fintech startup for Southeast Asia’s unbanked population Apple’s found a fair bit of success with Swift Playgrounds since launching it last year at WWDC. According to the company, the educational program has enlisted some one million users into its ranks. And while the dead simple offering is primarily aimed at youngsters, there’s apparently been a fair bit of interest across demographics. Today’s announcement extends Apple’s Swift-based educational offerings to an older age set, namely high schoolers and college-age students. The company has teamed with a half-dozen community colleges across the country to bring its App Development with Swift program to life, in order to help students enter the work world with app development knowledge. The very real “app economy” employs around 1.53 in the U.S., according to numbers offered up the company, making up a majority of the two million jobs its says it’s created in the U.S. Certainly it’s important for graduates to possess coding skills. And while Swift isn’t exactly an all-purpose language — designated solely for Apple products –there’s plenty of opportunity in those offerings and something to be said for learning the fundamentals of code, whatever language. Swift is also designed to be simple, in keeping with the whole Apple ethos. When the company says the programming language was built with education in mind, that’s mostly what it means. “The first thing Apple wanted Swift to be was approachable, “ Apple VP Lisa Jackson tells TechCrunch. “You don’t have to be a computer science type to interact and learn this language, so it can be a first programming language. But it needs to be powerful enough to write complex apps.” The program, which is an outgrowth of Apple’s Everyone Can Code curriculum for K-12, is designed to be taught over the course of two semesters – a full school year. Though precisely how it’s broken up will be at the discretion of the individual school. The colleges are apparently getting a fair amount of freedom here. Apple says it opted for a broad range of education partners to help cover a large gamut of nascent coders. “These are six schools in very different areas of the country,” says Jackson. “Some of them have more women than men. We have a lot of folks who are lower income or underrepresented minorities. A lot are interested in being a part of workforce development because they want to reach mid-development students.” The app is available starting today for free through iBooks. And while Apple isn’t making any money on app sales, it’s pretty easy to see why it made the effort to develop and pilot the program. Getting Swift into the hands of upstart developers is a pretty clear win for the company, much the same way that Macs and iPads in the classroom helped the company gain a foothold for decades as those students graduated and starting making their own purchasing decisions. If Swift can be the first a first coding language for young developers, the company will build itself a solid foothold into the future. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Apple Founded 1976 Overview Apple is a multinational corporation that designs, manufactures, and markets mobile communication and media devices, personal computers, portable digital music players, and sells a variety of related software, services, peripherals, networking solutions, and third-party digital content and applications.

Credit: SlashLeaksMost of the chatter around Apple's iPhone plans foresees the company releasing three new iPhones in the fall. Apple is expected to make modest updates to the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, but also to unveil the iPhone 8, which will include substantive changes to iPhone design, such as an edge-to-edge display. Some leaked images that were spotted by MacRumors this past weekend reportedly show molds of the upcoming iPhone releases, and one of those images — posted at SlashLeaks — gives us a good sense of how the iPhone 8 would measure up to Apple's existing iPhone models. Credit: SlashLeaksMore MORE: iPhone 8 vs. Galaxy S8: Clash of the Titans The leaked molds have the iPhone 8 in the center, flanked by an updated iPhone 7s Plus on the left and a new iPhone 7s on the right. In this scenario, the 7s Plus would keep the largest form factor, with the iPhone 8 only slightly taller than the 4.7-inch iPhone 7s. But that's in line with other rumors about the iPhone 8's display, which will reportedly stretch from the top of the phone to the bottom, similar to what Samsung and LG have done with the Galaxy S8 and G6, respectively. By doing away with most of the top and bottom bezels on its phone, Apple will be able to squeeze in more screen space without dramatically enlarging its new phone. The iPhone 8 will reportedly feature a 5.8-inch display even though its form factor will only be slightly larger than the 5.4 x 2.6 x 0.28-inch iPhone 7. If these molds are accurate, they confirm another rumored iPhone 8 feature — that the dual lenses on the rear camera will be stacked on top of each other. That's reportedly to help support augmented reality features slated for the iPhone 8. The iPhone 7s Plus would retain the horizontal orientation featured in the current Plus-sized iPhone. Credit: @VenyaGeskin1More images of the reported iPhone molds also appeared on Benjamin Geskin's Twitter account, with the most intriguing of the additional images showcasing the sides of the phone. The iPhone 8 mold features a noticeably longer button on its side. MacRumors says the longer button could be there to accommodate a fingerprint sensor as Apple looks for a place to put its Touch ID sensor on a redesigned iPhone. Extending the iPhone's display would mean getting rid of the physical home button on the iPhone 8. Apple will reportedly go with a virtual home button on its new phone, but that means it will also have to do something about the Touch ID sensor that lets you unlock your phone and confirm Apple Pay payments with a fingerprint. Apple's preference would be to move that sensor underneath the front display, but some reports claim that's proving problematic. Moving the sensor to a button on the side of the iPhone 8 might not be an ideal solution, but it's a better option than putting the fingerprint reader on the back of the device, which some rumors say may be an option.

A report from Business Insider states that Apple signed an application for an experimental license to test out new millimeter wave or 5G wireless technology. The application was signed on May 23 and was made public by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). According to the application, “Apple Inc. seeks to assess cellular link performance in direct path and multipath environments between base station transmitters and receivers using this spectrum.” ADVERTISEMENT “These assessments will provide engineering data relevant to the operation of devices on wireless carriers’ future 5G networks,” it continued. Furthermore, two locations have been determined for the tests: one in Milpitas, California on the Yosemite Drive, and the other on Mariani Avenue, where Apple’s first headquarters used to be located. The application also specifies the 28 and 39 GHz bands, which were FCC approved for commercial use for 5G application back in 2016. One clear advantage to be had from millimeter wave or 5G technology is the supposed drop in latency once usage of the technology becomes widespread. Apple, meanwhile, has not been publicly connected with 5G research before. The company is speculated to be doing the research now, due to the ongoing legal dispute with wireless chip supplier Qualcomm.

U.S. Editions Australia Edition China Edition India Edition Italy Edition Japan Edition Singapore Edition United Kingdom United States May 25, 2:48 AM EDT Subscribe Search Search Business Technology World National Media & Culture Millennial Money Entertainment Sports Subscribe Technology Apple iPhone 8 Dummy Showcased In Leaked Hands-On Video By Ken Manbert Salcedo On 05/24/17 AT 6:02 AM Close A dummy model for the Apple iPhone 8 has recently been shown off on in a new hands-on video. The iPhone 8 dummy looks pretty similar to previous leaks suggesting that this might be the iPhone 8’s final look when it launches this fall. The hands-on video for the iPhone 8 dummy was shared by Benjamin Geskin (@VenyaGeskin1) on Twitter. The video shows the handset being turned 360 degrees giving everyone a look at its front, back and sides. Like previously leaked in-the-wild photos, the new video once again shows glass panels on the front and back, while the handset comes with a very reflective stainless steel frame. The design is very reminiscent of the iPhone 4 and the iPhone 4s. One thing that really stands out in the hands on video for the iPhone 8 dummy is that the device appears to be thicker than Apple’s current iPhone lineup, as pointed out by 9To5Mac. The iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus are both rumored to feature thicker bodies, but the same hasn’t been said about the iPhone 8. Geskin said last month that the iPhone 8 will only be 7.1mm thin, the same measurement of the iPhone 7. He also says that the stainless steel frame will be colored black to match the iPhone 8’s color. The handset featured on the video is just a dummy or a mockup, so it’s very likely that the final version of the iPhone 8 may still look different. IBT reported yesterday that a PowerPoint presentation for the iPhone 8 was leaked online. One of the slides featured the the device’s back with the Touch ID sensor placed on the back just beneath the Apple logo. With Geskin’s hands-on video however, there’s no Touch ID to be seen. There also appears to be no physical home button up front. Some analysts believe that Apple might forgo placing the Touch ID sensor entirely. However, the most popular rumor that's going around is that Apple will be placing its Touch ID sensor beneath the OLED display. Speaking of OLED display, Geskin’s video doesn’t really show the iPhone 8’s display turned on. It’s really impossible to see if the handset will feature a bezel-less, all-screen design up front. Previous leaked renders show that the iPhone 8 will have a near-all-screen design, but the top portion of the will have a slim bezel for the earpiece, sensors and the frnont-facing camera. The video once again shows that the camera module on the back of the iPhone 8 will be positioned vertically. The pill-shaped camera module also appears to have the same stainless steel frame that’s found on the handset’s sides. Geskin is a Twitter-based leaker who’s gaining some notoriety in the last few months. His track record hasn’t been proven or disproven yet by actual shipping products, according to AppleInsider. He did’t disclose where he was able to get the iPhone 8 dummy, nor did he share how the dummy was made. Apple is expected to announce the iPhone 8 this fall alongside the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus. It’s widely believed that the iPhone 8 release date might be delayed to October and November because of production issues.

We bring you the latest information by Ashleigh Macro | 23 May 17 Reports of failing MacBook Pros have been flooding in since 2013, with many owners of 2011 models with AMD graphics suffering from system crashes and hardware problems that have been described as "critical". After a long wait, Apple finally announced a repair programme, and we've got all the details here. For coverage of similar programmes covering MacBooks and other Apple products, read our guide to Apple product recalls & free repair programmes. Apple's MacBook Pro repair programme On 19 February 2015 Apple announced a repair program for some MacBook Pro models suffering from the graphics issues we've described in this article. It's not officially a replacement program, but instead is titled "MacBook Pro Repair Extension Program for Video Issues." On its support page, Apple reveals it has determined "that a small percentage of MacBook Pro systems may exhibit distorted video, no video or unexpected system restarts". The specific symptoms described by Apple include distorted or scrambled video on the computer screen, no video on the computer screen (or external display) even though the computer is on, and the computer restarts unexpectedly. How to find out if your MacBook is eligible In May 2017 Apple announced that it is reducing the range of models eligible for a repair. So if you still haven't done so, visit the site as soon as possible and check if you qualify.  The products initially mentioned were the 15in and 17in MacBook Pro models manufactured in 2011, and 15in MacBook Pro with Retina models manufactured from Mid 2012 to Early 2013. But after the programme had been running for more than two years, the company stated: "The following models are no longer eligible for this program: MacBook Pro (15-inch, Early 2011), MacBook Pro (15-inch, Late 2011), MacBook Pro (17-inch, Early 2011) and MacBook Pro (17-inch, Late 2011)." Which means that only the MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2012) and MacBook Pro (Retina, 15 inch, Early 2013) are now eligible. Here's how to find out what model of Mac you've got; if your Mac is out of action thanks to the graphics issue, you may find it easier to type in your serial number here. How to get your MacBook Pro repaired If your Mac is eligible, you'll now need to back up your MacBook Pro, and then bring it to an Apple Retail Store or Apple Authorised Service Provider (find out how to make an appointment at the Apple Store here). An Apple technician will then run a diagnostic test to verify eligibility, and let you know how long it'll take to repair. Note, however, that if there is other damage to your MacBook Pro that "prevents the repair" such as a cracked screen, they'll charge you for the replacement of that. Aside from that, though, the repair program is completely free (and so it should be!). You'll be notified when your MacBook Pro has been fixed and is ready to be collected, and fingers crossed the issue will have been resolved. The repair program kicks off in the US and Canada on 20 February, and in other countries from 27 February, and will run until 27 February 2016 or three years from its original date of sale, whichever of those provides longer coverage. Since first publishing this story, we've had more than 750 readers get in touch to let us know that they're experiencing the same issue. The huge thread on Apple's Support Communities has now been viewed more than 4 million times and has more than 12,100 replies. In August 2014, a petition that started last year urging Apple to recall the affected MacBook Pro laptops to fix the problem passed the 10,000-signature mark, and in October 2014 it soared past the 20,000 supporters mark, and it reached a total of 38,205 before Apple finally addressed the issue. It may in part also be due to the class action lawsuit Apple was hit with in October in a California court.  The lawsuit claims that the defect in the 2011 MacBook Pro comes from the lead-free solder that's used to connect one of the processing chips to the main circuit board in the computer. According to the complaint, the frequent changes in temperature that occur while using the MacBook Pro cause the lead-free solder to crack, which in turn causes the graphics issues as described above. A very similar lawsuit was been filed in Canada, against Apple Canada. The problem, which first emerged in February 2013, escalated throughout 2014 as more and more owners of the affected models began to experience issues. While playing games, watching HD video or performing another graphics-intensive task, users have witnessed their displays distorting, or sometimes going completely blank. Rebooting the machine temporarily resolves the issue, but it almost always returns. Eventually, many users found that their MacBook boots to a blue or grey screen. Currently, the only permanent resolution is to get a replacement logic board, but that can prove quite costly without Apple Care. It's believed that overheating is to blame for the issue. Some of the readers who've been in touch have said that Apple has replaced their 2011 MacBook Pro's logic board thanks to Apple Care, with some customers even claiming to have had their logic board replaced multiple times. In the past, Apple has offered replacement hard drives for iMacs containing 1TB Seagate hard drives that have been known to fail, replacement MagSafe adapters, iBook logic board replacements back in 2004, and, most recently, a MacBook Air flash storage drive replacement programme for June 2012 to June 2013 models. Concerned owners of afflicted MacBooks have set up a Facebook page and a petition. Are you a MacBook Pro owner experiencing the issue? Let us know in the comments section below.

It has been reported that the Wistron Corp has started manufacturing the first batch of trial smartphones, which will be built in limited quantities. It is expected to start domestic shipping this month itself. In March this year, Karnataka IT minister, Priyank Kharge, told FE that Apple Inc will be ready to start assembling high-end iPhones in the city in less than a month to boost its chances of gaining a foothold in the fast-growing Indian market.© image You may also like to watch: Apple?s stint with Indian manufacturing comes at a time when many Chinese smartphone companies including the likes of Xiaomi, Huawei, and others are starting their manufacturing units in India.

While it is still unknown at what price the Indian-made iPhone SE will be sold at, but it is likely to be cheaper than the models sold in the US.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Smartphones Forget iPhone 8, here's how iPhone 9 will make your jaws drop in 2018 Samsung will play a major role in making the supersized iPhone 9. Sami Khan   May 24, 2017 15:07 IST Apple is rumoured to make significant modifications to its next-generation iPhone 8 to compete against Samsung's radically designed Galaxy S8.Apple All eyes are set on the iPhone 8 launch this year since it marks the tenth year anniversary of the first iPhone. While Apple is burdened by a lot of hopes, it is also looking beyond iPhone 8. There's nothing concrete on the iPhone 8 so far, but that hasn't stop rumours from speculating the upgrades the new iPhone will bring. Fans, critics and tipsters are closely watching iPhone 8 developments, so much that they almost missed the Cupertino tech titan's plans for 2018. The Investor reported on Tuesday that Apple and Samsung have signed a deal where the iPhone 9's OLED panels will be sourced from the South Korean tech giant. Rumours are rife that Samsung will be providing 80 million OLED panels for this year's iPhone 8, and the latest report suggests the shipment to be doubled to 180 million units for iPhone 9 next year. Citing a non-disclosure agreement between the two tech giants, the report revealed that the upcoming iPhone 9 will be the largest iPhones to come till date. Apple will reportedly ditch the 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch sizes in favour of 5.28-inch and 6.46-inch displays. The latest report confirms two important features of the iPhone 9 – large displays and OLED panels. With the increase in size, we can expect a massive design overhaul in next year's iPhone. But it's way too soon to conclude anything on the iPhone 9 specs, especially since there's nothing solid on this year's iPhone 8, which is due for release in September this year. Marking the tenth-year anniversary of iPhone, Apple is expected to launch three iPhone models this year. One of them is going to be the premium iPhone 8, while the other two models – iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus – will come with essential upgrades. Talking of the high-end iPhone 8, the flagship is going to feature a full glass design with stainless steel frame, 5.5-inch or 5.7-inch OLED display, IP68 waterproofing, fingerprint scanner under the display, dual camera setup, Iris scanner, wireless charging and more. All these upgrades will come at a price, and a really high one. Analysts have estimated the iPhone 8 to cost upwards of $1,000. The flagship model will come only in 128GB and 256GB storage options, while 32GB base variants will be reserved for iPhone 7s models, which will start at around $650.

And the company has a corporate heavy weight for the job in the form of its own Denise Young Smith, formerly Vice President of Worldwide Human Resources. 9to5Mac reported that her new title will be Vice President for Inclusion and Diversity, and that she will report directly to CEO Tim Cook. Apple VP of Inclusion and Diversity “Our inclusion and diversity efforts are critically important to Apple’s future,” Apple said in a statement. “Denise’s years of experience, expertise and passion will help us make an even greater impact in this area.” Human Resources Human resources is vitally important for any company with more than a few employees. I tried to make this point in Tuesday’s Daily Observations with Jeff Gamet and Dave Hamilton, but I was unable to articulate it the way I wanted to during the show. HR isn’t sexy, and no one talks about it outside of a company. To the outside world, HR managers don’t get the attention that marketing, engineering, design, or even logistics executives get, but they wield enormous power within their organizations. There is intense competition in Silicon Valley for senior HR managers, too. All of which is to say that Denise Young Smith might not be well known to Apple watchers, but she’s been with the company for 20 years. With her experience at Apple, she can do anything she wants anywhere she wants. Furthermore, in many companies, diversity managers report to the head of HR or are otherwise part of the HR infrastructure. Ms. Young Smith, however, will be reporting directly to Tim Cook, and that gives us tremendous insight into how seriously both Mr. Cook and Ms. Young Smith take the position of Vice President of Inclusion and Diversity. Inclusion and Diversity Inclusion and diversity (ID) has been gaining prominence in corporate circles in recent years, and Ms. Young Smith won’t be the first ID executive reporting to a CEO. But she will be one of the highest profile ID execs working for one of the highest profile CEOs at the highest profile corporation. All in all that makes this development important. Few will care out here in the world of Apple fans (and Apple haters, too). But Wall Street, Silicon Valley, and the broader corporate ranks in the U.S. are paying close attention.

New Microsoft Surface Pro (2017) vs Surface Pro 4 (2015): What’s the difference? By Luke Edwards 24th May 2017 Features Tweet We compare the new 2017 model of Surface Pro to Microsoft's previous Surface Pro 4 device, to see how these 2-in-1 tablet/laptop convertibles stack up. Microsoft has just taken the wraps off a new Surface Pro hybrid tablet-cum-laptop that it says is faster, more powerful, even lighter and more intuitive to use than the 18-month-old Surface Pro 4. The new name ditches those numbers for a simple Surface Pro title. This is partly because the new model has been completely redesigned inside and out, for an rebooted experience better than ever before. At least, so claims Microsoft. Perhaps the company just fancied doing an Apple, who in 2017 has already released the all-new 'Apple iPad'. The new Surface Pro consists of a whopping 800 new parts when compared to the older Surface Pro 4. So what’s actually changed and will this new platform be the ultimate way to experience Windows 10? Check out our detailed comparison of the new Surface Pro 2017 model with the iPad Pro, Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 and Huawei's all-new MateBook E. New Surface Pro is faster and lasts longer than Surface Pro 4 One of the biggest and most important updates for the new Surface Pro is the processor tech. Stuffed inside this convertible device you'll now find Intel’s latest seventh generation Kaby Lake CPUs (with a choice of m3, i5 or i7 processors). These fanless chipsets support up to 16GB of RAM and offer Intel HD Graphics 615 or 620, or Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640, depending on the model involved. The older Surface Pro 4 topped out at Intel Core M, i5 and i7 6th-gen models with Intel HD Graphics 540. What does that actually mean in normal speak? Well, you can of course expect the new Surface Pro 2017 model to be faster than the older Pro 4. You can also expect more efficient processing - in fact, Microsoft reckons you'll get 13.5 hours of mixed use on a single charge. We'll be testing this out in full for our new Surface Pro review, of course. New Surface Pro sports a different design to the Pro 4 Microsoft is proud to say that the new Surface Pro is 'ultra light', for added portability and convenience. The official specs place it somewhere between 766g and 786g, depending on your chosen chipsets. The older Surface Pro 4, by comparison, weighed in at between...766g and 786g. Hmm, slightly confusing. When Microsoft launched the Surface Laptop, it made a big deal about that Alcantara skinned keyboard. Well, now it’s added the same material to the new Surface Pro. This Alcantara Type Cover will offer the same grip and tactile feedback as well as high quality finish that you get on the laptop, for a more premium feel compared with the Surface Pro 4's standard Type Cover. Microsoft says the new Surface Pro is also more flexible, literally, thanks to the upgraded hinge mechanism. This will fold right out into the new Studio mode, meaning a lie-flat position ideal for using the Surface Pen. Ports are the same across both Surface Pro models with USB 3.0, mini-DisplayPort and microSD expandability on offer. New Surface Pro has a next-gen Surface Pen Microsoft has launched the next-gen Surface Pen along with the latest Surface Pro device. This features a hefty 4,096 levels of pressure, measuring with a 21ms latency and tilt sensitivity. If you're after incredible precision for your creative sketches, this is the one for you. It also looks like you’ll have access to the Surface Dial accessory that appeared with the Surface Studio. That means the ability to quickly select new tools and manipulate on-screen items with ease. How do the other specs compare? Microsoft's enhanced colour PixelSense display has been used for the new 2017 edition of Surface Pro. That means a 12.3-inch multi-touch screen with a 2736 x 1824 resolution. For the eagle eyed, you’ll notice that’s the same resolution as the Surface Pro 4, offering a pleasing 267 pixels-per-inch. Both the new and old Surface Pro feature 8-megapixel rear cameras that can record up to 1080p HD video, plus 5-megapixel front-facing cameras also with 1080p HD video capabilities. No changes when it comes to storage space, either. Both Surface Pros are available with these storage options: 128GB, 256GB, 512GB or 1TB. New Microsoft Surface Pro's asking price is slightly higher than the Surface Pro 4 As you’d probably expect, the latest Surface Pro is a little more pricey than the older Surface Pro 4, but not by much. The new Surface Pro will be released on June 15 here in the UK, starting at £799. The Surface Pro 4, still available to buy now, starts at £749. Since you can spec the models out as you please, that price can go all the way up to just over £2300 on the Surface Pro 4. Meanwhile the new Surface Pro tops out at an eye-watering £2700.

Forget iPhone 8 rumours… Apple fans are ALREADY gossiping about the iPhone 9 The gadget won't be released for at least another 18 months, but that hasn't stopped speculation about what it will be like By Rod Chester, news.com.au 24th May 2017, 9:48 am Updated: 24th May 2017, 10:34 am Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Comments WE’VE not even seen the iPhone 8 yet and tech fans are ALREADY talking about the iPhone 9. The daily Apple iPhone rumour mill has skipped forward a generation and is now beginning to generate gossip about the features of a flagship smartphone that is still 18 months away from being released, news.com.au reports. Apple users outraged as new iPhone 8 has relocated home button to the BACK PA:Press Association 1 The Apple rumour mill is beginning to generate gossip about the features of a flagship smartphone that is still 18 months away from being released While new rumours continue to come out on a daily basis about this year's iPhone 8, there are already tips on what Apple is working on next. Mac Rumours has spotted what could be the first iPhone 9 leak in the Korean Herald. It reports that the iPhone 9 could be massive. According to the newspaper, Apple has done a deal with Samsung who will produce the OLED screens for the phones in two sizes: 5.28-inches and 6.46-inches.

The other sneak peek comes from Apple Insider, which reports that Apple has been given clearance to start testing 5G connectivity in its US iPhone labs. With 5G technology promising download speeds 60 times faster than the top NBN bracket, Apple’s move to ensure its phone is ready for the network upgrade when it comes in the next few years is good news for iPhone fans. Of course, the rumours are not confirmed and Apple will still need to test a lot of features - and several dummy models - before it locks down the final design of the iPhone 9.

Huawei, a Chinese multinational company working its way through the gadgets market, has finally come up with a MacBook clone that would not make its users regret switching brands. Via @CNET – Huawei just announced a really, really good-looking laptop https://t.co/5reAW8VX5p — HuaweiUSA (@HuaweiUSA) May 23, 2017 Based on a review of the device from Engadget, Huawei’s second try at the MacBook copying race did not disappoint as the MateBook X sports some features that not only differentiate it from the Apple laptop but also make it worth every penny. According to the review, the physical appearance of the device from one of China’s top tech firms has an impeccable resemblance to that of the Cupertino-company’s 12-inch MacBook. In fact, a close look at its logos is needed to tell the two apart. But despite the physical similarities, the Huawei MateBook X tops Apple’s laptop with its power button that is integrated with a fingerprint sensor to make accessing one’s profile easier than ever. It is also compatible with the Windows Hello feature. With the MateBook X, Huawei finally has a MacBook to call its own https://t.co/4bjwLaK0KK pic.twitter.com/vpesQHDtyu — TechCrunch (@TechCrunch) May 23, 2017 According to Tech Crunch, the company also ditched the touchscreen and convertibility features that were present in its first MateBook, with the MateBook X being a stand-alone laptop. The outlet believes that this may have hurt the device’s chance to lead the gadgets race since it runs on Windows 10 which sells better with two-in-one hybrid laptops with touch screen. However, the outlet deems the company’s partnership with Dolby one of its greatest assets as the Huawei MateBook X comes with impressive Dolby Atmos surround sound system, particularly the on-board speaker hardware. The rest of the specs is already similar to Apple’s MacBook. Its 13-inch display has a 3:2 aspect ratio matched with 2K resolution and a 4.4mm bezel, and it boasts 256GB or 512GB SSD options. In terms of RAM, the Chinese tech firm provided users with 4GB or 8GB choices although The Verge believes that an average user would go for the higher random access memory considering that the laptop is meant to be a portable computer that can do most of the work. Processor-wise, the clamshell designed Huawei MateBook X comes with either an Intel Core i5 or i7 instead of the less powerful Core M series and can last for as long as 10 hours while being used to watch a 1080p video after a single charge. Of course, the device has a bit of a downside that included a dim display when used in bright sunlight and the use of minimal ports which means the user have to have adapters and extension docks to make use of the typical microSD, HDMI, USB A, USB C, and VGA connectivity. Seemingly predicting this reaction, the company decided to throw in a dock that has all these ports—except the microSD reader—with the Huawei MateBook X package. Overall, the device got stellar reviews despite the apparent lack of originality. “It’s thin, light, fast, and if Huawei’s promises about battery life hold up in real-world testing, then the MateBook X could be a really good portable laptop option that could offer a legitimate challenge to Apple’s languishing MacBook Air line,” The Verge noted. However, there is the matter of the device’s tag price which, as of the writing of this article, remains a mystery. The only other thing Huawei decided to reveal is that the new Huawei MateBook will be available in rose gold which basically reeks more imitation of Apple’s MacBook.

While the currency has rallied since the election was called, BlueBay began selling sterling last week, betting that the UK is set for a damaging Brexit process after the vote. Such a view chimes with Allianz Global Investors, which recently used the rally in the pound to short it, and the median forecast of analysts in a Bloomberg News survey, which says the pound will decline about 3 per cent by the end of 2017. Read more UK remains top investment destination but signs of Brexit impact grow “We’ve literally gone short on the pound at the end of last week,” said Mark Dowding, a fund manager at BlueBay, which oversees $55.5bn (£42.8bn). “We think you’re going to be facing a Brexit that to us looks like it’s going to be a hard Brexit.” The pound, which tumbled following the UK’s decision to leave the European Union last June, has pared some of those losses as investors speculate that the earlier vote will ease pressure on Prime Minister Theresa May. The Conservatives are currently expected to comfortably win the 8 June snap elections with a large majority in Parliament. Read more UK markets steady after terror threat level is raised to ‘critical’ Sterling slips after Manchester Arena bombing Pound near eight-month high against dollar but caution dominates Sterling reached a nine-month high of 1.3048 on 18 May, and was trading at around $1.30 on Wednesday. Even after rallying 5 per cent in 2017, sterling remains about 13 percent weaker since the Brexit vote last June. “There’s been this optimism in markets that a really big majority may actually strengthen Theresa May’s hand and make life a lot easier,” said Mr Dowding, who predicts sterling could retest $1.20 toward the end of the year -- an 8 per cent decline from the current levels. “I’m not really sure it will make too much difference in practice.” Tough comments from both sides of the negotiating table signal a choppy path ahead. Bundesbank board member Andreas Dombret said on Tuesday divorce proceedings would likely be hard or very hard.

The “exceptionally-sized” stone was presumed not to be real because 19th Century diamonds were not cut to show off their brilliance like today's gems. And so the owner, unaware of its value, wore it for decades, while doing everything from the shopping to the chores.

The ruling is the latest in a long running legal battle between the Swiss-based company and its rival Cadbury. Nestlé argues that the KitKat’s shape is “iconic” and should be protected by law but Cadbury objects. On Wednesday, the Court of Appeal ruled in favour of Cadbury, dismissing the claim. iStock 8/29 Yorkshire is the best region in the UK for workplace happiness - Tuesday 16 May The best region in Britain for workplace happiness and satisfaction is Yorkshire and the Humber, according to new research.
