Cory Gardner (6 letters) screen shotHow to tweak settings on your iPhone to let Apple take care of backing up photos. Q: What is the best way to save photos taken on an iPhone? ~Cheryl Armstrong, Loveland Tech+ The best way — with “best” meaning easiest — is to let Apple handle it via its online cloud storage. Take a photo and whoosh! Apple backs it up online in your private iCloud. That works until you hit your free 5 GB storage limit, and then you have to pay Apple a monthly fee to expand your storage. This also can use up your data allowance. So best? Well, it’s all relative. But let me run you through some options (and for Android or other smartphone users, the suggestions can be tweaked to work with your phones, too). ScreenshotLetting your iPhone automatically back up new photos requires changing the iCloud settings, as pictured here. The easiest: Let Apple do it If you use all your iPhone’s built-in apps, then here’s how to back up your photos. Make sure you have signed up for Apple’s iCloud storage. Check by going into phone’s “Settings” and then “iCloud.” Staying in the iCloud settings, look for “Photos,” which takes you to the area to configure how iCloud should back up photos. There are four options with toggle switches. This should be self-explanatory. Turning on “My Photo Stream” won’t use up mobile data but only activates when connected to Wi-Fi. More tips are at support.apple.com/icloud Do this and if you lose your phone, you’ll still have all your photos in Apple’s cloud. However, go beyond the free 5 GB of storage and expect to pay a monthly fee. Use a different cloud service to back up photos Take your pick: Google Photos, Dropbox, Prime Photos from Amazon, Flickr, Microsoft OneDrive. All have iPhone apps that do the same thing as Apple’s iCloud, including some free storage. Amazon and Google offer free unlimited photo storage with some caveats (you need to either be an Amazon Prime member or for Google, opt for lower resolution). Either way, such cloud apps are also configured in the iPhone’s settings so you can set the apps to automatically back up new photps. Plugging in: Backing up photos to a computer If you’re one of those people who prefer to have that photo backed up on a computer hard drive, you can do this in one of two ways: Rely on iTunes or drag them to a folder on your computer. Within iTunes (assuming you’ve installed this on your computer): The first time you connect your iPhone, iTunes will ask, “Do you want to allow this computer to access information on “iPhone” (or whatever you’ve named your phone). Hit “Continue.” Now, open iTunes and look for the tiny icon of a phone. This is usually near the top — below the play button and below the “File”  options — and next to the drop-down box that says “Music” or “Movies,” etc. Click the phone icon. This opens the phone’s settings. Select the option to automatically back up to “This computer.” There’s also an option to “Back up now.” But if you don’t want to bother with Apple’s software, go old school and turn your iPhone in a hard drive. Connect the iPhone to a computer via the proper cable. The iPhone will ask, “Trust this computer?” Select yes. Separately, create a folder for iPhone photos. This could be part of your existing photos folder. Keep this open. Open Windows Explorer to see the directory of your PC. Look for your phone, which could be simply “Apple iPhone.” Select it and you’ll probably see one folder that says “DCIM.” Open that and you’ll end up in iPhone’s assorted photo folders. Then drag and drop photos to another folder you created on your PC. Use a photo app to print a hard copy If you’re truly old school and prefer to touch and feel printed photos, check with your favorite photo printer store to see if it has an app that lets you pick and choose images on your phone to send directly to the printer. Some options:  Walgreens: Not only can you fill your prescription with this app, you can order photo prints right on the phone! Pick up is available in an hour. Details at dpo.st/walgreensphoto. Freeprints from PhotoAffections — It’s not totally free, but users can pick up to 85 4×6 photos per month and get them printed for a shipping fee that “never exceeds $9.99.” Details at freeprintsapp.com. Shutterfly, Snapfish, Photobucket… All have apps that let you pick and edit photos and then order prints. Update: Last week’s Tech+ answer offering free alternatives to Microsoft Word missed one goodie: WordPad. This stripped-down software has been a freebie since Windows 95. I didn’t even realize it was still around! But reader Bob Correll reminded me (thanks Bob!): WordPad 10 is available as a free Windows 10 app. Hunt for it in the Windows search area.

The Raiders were down 46-12 to Apple Valley, which went on to wins its 12th straight team state title, heading into the final match. All that was left was for Guck to go out there and take on Apple Valley heavyweight Gable Steveson, a world champion who’s likely the best high school wrestler in the nation. What can you possibly say to a kid in that spot? “You just tell them that this is a great opportunity. How often do you get the opportunity to wrestle a world champ? Never, really,” McLay said. “I say, ‘Take advantage of the opportunity, have fun, and don’t get hurt.’ ” Have fun and don’t get hurt? “That’s seriously what I tell them,” McLay said with a smile. “The thing is those guys have all the pressure on them, and go out there and have fun and try to surprise yourself and take advantage of the opportunity, because you just don’t get a lot of those in life. That’s all you can ask. It’s just a good opportunity to wrestle against one of the best in the world, so why not?” Guck was pinned in 45 seconds, which is about the average result of a Steveson match. Apple Valley Eagles Gable Steveson controls Anoka Tornado Brandon Frankfurth during the 285 pound match of the AAA championship match at the Minnesota State High School Wrestling Tournament at Xcel Energy Center in St. Paul on Thursday, March 2, 2017. Stevenson pinned Frankfurth in 22 seconds as Apple Valley would win the team AAA title with a 30-24 victory over Anoka. (Special to the Pioneer Press: John Autey) Minnesota always seems to have at least few of those world-class, nearly unbeatable wrestlers at the state tournament. This year it’s guys like Steveson (38-0) and Kasson-Mantorville’s Brady Berge (44-0), both of whom cruised into Saturday night’s individual state finals in their respective weight classes. Then, of course, there was Mark Hall, who won his sixth individual state title as an Apple Valley senior at state last year. In the opposing coaching corner for Hall’s final high school match was again McLay, coaching then-Hastings senior Austin Eichmann. Hall beat Eichmann by technical fall, 16-1. But Eichmann got second place and is pictured on this year’s state tournament program cover for his efforts. Of course, the picture is of Hall lying on top of him. “So I take a picture of it and send it to (Eichmann) and I go, ‘You made the cover!’ ” McLay said. “Typically, you’d be bummed out if you’re getting crushed on the cover, but he’s like, ‘You know what, I’m not even mad!’ I’m like, ‘I know, it’s pretty cool.’ ” That seems to be the overwhelming opinion of wrestlers who go up against those unmovable forces. “It was pretty fun wrestling the best,” said St. Cloud Tech senior Micah Mangel, who was pinned by Steveson in the first period of a first-round matchup in the Class 3A, 285-pound division Thursday. Mahtomedi senior Evan Lawrence was excited when he saw the draw for this year’s Class 2A, 160-pound individual tournament, which pitted him against Berge in the first round. “I just kind of looked forward to it the whole week,” Lawrence said. His plan of attack against Berge, a Penn State commit, was to go “out there wanting to have fun and trying to score some points against a high-caliber guy like that.” EARLY CHAMP CROWNED The individual state finals were slated for 6:30 Saturday night, but one champion was determined before 3 p.m. Moorhead’s Sam Grove clinched the Class 3A, 195-pound title by winning his semifinal match over Centennial’s Justin Mohlin. Grove didn’t have to wrestle the final because his opponent, St. Cloud Tech’s Tyler Hugg, missed the match with a concussion. Hugg suffered the concussion in his semifinal match with Eastview’s Mike Delich. Delich, who was previously undefeated, took Hugg down in the first period. But the takedown was deemed illegal by the referees, and because the move caused Hugg to not be able to continue, Hugg won the match by injury default. Grove’s state title was Moorhead’s first since 2012.

Friday’s complaint concerns three apartment buildings – located at 201 5th Ave. N., 621 5th Ave. S., and 401 Pine Street in Edmonds – that are managed by defendant Debbie A. Appleby, of Stanwood, Wash. The properties are owned by three Limited Liability Corporations controlled by Appleby – Apple One, LLC, Apple Two, LLC, and Apple Three, LLC—which are also named as defendants in the suit. The complaint alleges that in March 2014, defendant Appleby told a woman seeking an apartment for herself, her husband and their 1-year-old child that the apartment buildings were “adult only” and therefore not available to her family. The complaint also alleges that at various other times from April 2014 to November 2015, defendants advertised their available apartments as being restricted to adults only. The family filed a complaint with the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which conducted an investigation, issued a charge of discrimination against the defendants, and referred the case to the Department of Justice. “Equal access to housing is essential for all Americans, including families with young children,” said U.S. Attorney Annette L. Hayes. “Particularly in our tight housing market, landlords must follow the law and make units available without discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability or familial status.” “The Fair Housing Act prohibits landlords from denying apartments to families just because they have children,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Tom Wheeler of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. “Many families already face challenges finding affordable housing, and they should not also have to deal with unlawful discrimination.” The complaint seeks a court order requiring defendants to cease their discriminatory housing practices, damages for the family that filed the HUD complaint and any other families against whom the defendants discriminated against because they had children, plus civil penalties. Any individuals who have information relevant to this case are encouraged to contact the Civil Rights Division at 1-800-896-7743, Option 96.The case is being jointly handled by trial attorney Kathryn Legomsky for the Civil Rights Division for the U.S. Department of Justice and Assistant United States Attorney J. Michael Diaz for the Western District of Washington. You can read the full Justice Department complaint here.

Reply Laura Johnson March 4, 2017 at 2:14 pm Joy- That is disappointing, but Edmonds is not immune and discrimination eventually touches all of us. We need to take a stand against discrimination and profiling- in their many unjust forms.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple Caught in another Controversial Story about Supporting Slave and Child Labor in Congo | Main | Apple Still in the Hunt for a Transformative Acquisition to set Apple TV on Fire Prior to the Arrival of the Mobile TV Revolution » March 04, 2017 Apple Struggled in the Education Market in 2016 as Schools on Tight Budgets Chose Chromebooks   Back in 2014 AppleInsider's editorial writer and digital assassin Daniel Dilger took the Financial Times to task on the subject of Google Chromebooks overtaking Apple in Education. Since that time stories have kept piling in with the same conclusion that Google's Chromebook was the top computer used in the classroom. USA Today, 9to5Mac, CNBC, Fast Company and others kept that story front and center over the years along with the statistics to backup those claims. This week the New York Times weighed in with a report titled "Apple's Devices Lose Luster in American Classrooms," based on new education market statistics from Futuresource.   The NY Times report starts off dramatically by stating that "Apple is losing its grip on American classrooms, which technology companies have long used to hook students on their brands for life.   Over the last three years, Apple's iPads and Mac notebooks — which accounted for about half of the mobile devices shipped to schools in the United States in 2013 — have steadily lost ground to Chromebooks, inexpensive laptops that run on Google's Chrome operating system and are produced by Samsung, Acer and other computer makers.   Mobile devices that run on Apple's iOS and macOS operating systems have now reached a new low, falling to third place behind both Google-powered laptops and Microsoft Windows devices, according to a report released on Thursday by Futuresource Consulting, a research company.   Futuresource noted in their report that of the 12.6 million mobile devices shipped to primary and secondary schools in the United States in 2016, Chromebooks accounted for 58 percent of the market, up from 50 percent in 2015.   School shipments of iPads and Mac laptops fell to 19 percent, from about 25 percent, over the same period. Microsoft Windows laptops and tablets remained relatively stable at about 22 percent, Futuresource said. Mike Fisher, an education technology analyst at Futuresource told the Times that "Apple is struggling." For more on the NY Times report, click here.   Google's Chromebook Continues to Win   Futuresource's report that was published on Thursday noted that "Sales of Mobile PCs into the US K-12 sector continued to develop in 2016, with annual shipments growing 18% year-on-year in 2016, reaching 12.6 million units, up from 10.7 million in 2015. The outlook for 2017 is also positive with market shipment growth forecast to remain in double figures."   The number one platform in education was from Google. Their strengths were a "strong combination of affordable devices, productivity tools via G-Suite, easy integration with third party platforms/tools, task management/distribution via Google Classroom and easy device management remains extremely popular with US teachers and IT buyers alike. The rise of Chromebooks has also set new industry benchmarks with regards to average device pricing, with prices reaching as low as $120 on certain projects."   The Rise of Hybrid Tablet-Notebooks   The last point of interest is the report's position on hybrid devices for this year. "It is the area of '2-in-1' devices (devices that can be utilised both as tablets and with an integrated keyboard for productivity applications) that are expected to be the major competitive area in 2017.   Both Microsoft and Google (and their respective partners) have announced a wide range of 2-in-1 products designed specifically for education and are expected to sell for under $300.   The 2-in-1 form factor is ideal for education, providing schools with flexibility in usage. In addition, the technology behind stylus/pen usage has developed rapidly and 'inking' is expected to become widespread and add value to device usage.   Mike Fisher, Associate Director of Education at Futuresource Consulting, added that "PC provider's laser focus on the education sector is good news for schools and students. 2017 will see wide ranges of computing devices, designed specifically for education and at competitive price points, entering the market and vying to be the device of choice for learning."   Though for most school districts it's about tight budgets and this is where the Chromebook usually gets the nod.   Last year Patently Apple posted a report titled "Apple and IBM have launched their First MobileFirst App for Education Called 'Watson Element'," showing that many schools are looking for deeper educational tools and more advanced devices like the iPad.   Considering that the top Fortune 500 companies and now leading medical facilities around the U.S. like Stanford Medicine are using the iPad, many schools will want to ensure that their students are familiar with tools that industry leaders prefer.   Not every school wants to work with bottom of the line tools and so Apple will continue to introduce new iPad models later this year with more software to assist educators prepare their students for the real world.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Friday’s complaint concerns three apartment buildings – located at 201 5th Ave. N., 621 5th Ave. S., and 401 Pine Street in Edmonds – that are managed by defendant Debbie A. Appleby, of Stanwood, Wash. The properties are owned by three Limited Liability Corporations controlled by Appleby – Apple One, LLC, Apple Two, LLC, and Apple Three, LLC—which are also named as defendants in the suit. The complaint alleges that in March 2014, defendant Appleby told a woman seeking an apartment for herself, her husband and their 1-year-old child that the apartment buildings were “adult only” and therefore not available to her family. The complaint also alleges that at various other times from April 2014 to November 2015, defendants advertised their available apartments as being restricted to adults only. The family filed a complaint with the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which conducted an investigation, issued a charge of discrimination against the defendants, and referred the case to the Department of Justice. “Equal access to housing is essential for all Americans, including families with young children,” said U.S. Attorney Annette L. Hayes. “Particularly in our tight housing market, landlords must follow the law and make units available without discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability or familial status.” “The Fair Housing Act prohibits landlords from denying apartments to families just because they have children,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Tom Wheeler of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. “Many families already face challenges finding affordable housing, and they should not also have to deal with unlawful discrimination.” The complaint seeks a court order requiring defendants to cease their discriminatory housing practices, damages for the family that filed the HUD complaint and any other families against whom the defendants discriminated against because they had children, plus civil penalties. Any individuals who have information relevant to this case are encouraged to contact the Civil Rights Division at 1-800-896-7743, Option 96.The case is being jointly handled by trial attorney Kathryn Legomsky for the Civil Rights Division for the U.S. Department of Justice and Assistant United States Attorney J. Michael Diaz for the Western District of Washington. You can read the full Justice Department complaint here.

We couldn’t figure it out because she was one of the first people to view and she and her husband had great jobs. Now she knows. Reply Laura Johnson March 4, 2017 at 2:14 pm Joy- That is disappointing, but Edmonds is not immune and discrimination eventually touches all of us. We need to take a stand against discrimination and profiling- in their many unjust forms. Reply Alec denson March 4, 2017 at 9:30 pm “not immune to discrimination” – pretty euphemistic way of putting it. Edmonds is one of the whitest places in western Washington.

Smith Mar 4, 2017, 10:00 AM Here One Smart Wireless Earbuds in Best Headphones 2017 The good Lightweight Snug fit Clean design Can be charged in the case App allows for augmented listening The bad Estimated battery life is only 2 hours App connection can be buggy Verdict The Here One smart wireless earbuds are for early adopters eager to experience the future of augmented listening. Everyone else should wait for a pair with longer battery life. 7/10 Very good $299.99 Here One Don't call them earbuds. The Here One ($299) is so much more. These wearables are actually a pair of computers with a set of microphones that can potentially change how we listen and what we hear. Paired with the app, these earphones offer a form of augmented hearing that essentially layers ambient sound over whatever you happened to be listening to at the moment, creating a merged audio experience. Want a more secluded listening experience? Just hit a button, and enjoy your tunes minus a noisy cubicle mate or street traffic. As fun and intriguing as the aural concept is, though, packing a computer into something as small as an earbud does entail some sacrifice, the biggest of which is extremely short battery life. Still, the Here One is like a piece of the near future for a modern-day audience.   Design This is what the future looks like: not a pair of earbuds with the cords lopped off (as on the Apple AirPods) but a device that tastefully combines form and function. The outer shell of the Here One buds is done in a matte white that's accentuated by a pearlescent silver stripe in the center. The part of the earphones that reside in your ear is made from a matte gray plastic with five embedded metal connectors for charging. A small “L” (left) and “R” (right) etched into each respective bud eliminates any confusion when it's time to put them in your ears. Instead of dangling from my ears like a techy take on the hair-gel gag from There’s Something About Mary, the Here One buds protrude ever so slightly from my ears. In short, they're interesting enough to be a conversation starter without being outlandish. When I'm not using the earphones, they reside in their case, which is constructed of the same unassuming gray matte plastic seen on the buds. The part where the earbuds are housed is made of white matte plastic and features four status light indicators for tracking charging progress. Welcome to Augmented Listening As cool as the Here One buds look, the magic doesn't truly happen until you launch the app. After I paired the buds with the app, it was time for some fun. The free Here One app gives the listener a form of augmented or layered hearing, through its six noise filters (Airplane, City, Crowd, Noise Mask, Office and Restaurant).  That meant that as I sat at my desk, listening to Floetry's "Sunshine," I held a conversation with a few of my colleagues while using the Restaurant filter. The integrated microphones in each bud focused on the conversation in front of me, layering it over my music and allowing me to hum along and hold a conversation. I could enjoy my jams without the intrusion of subway announcements, panhandlers and unruly teens. On my way to the subway after work, I switched to the City setting, which let in the ambient noise of my surroundings, including honking horns and errant conversations. But as fun as listening in on conversations surreptitiously can be, my favorite filters were the ones that let me shut out the world. Noise Mask, for example, pumps in white noise to bring the world down to a dull roar. But I ultimately found myself using the Office setting the most. It didn't pump in a bunch of artificial noise like Noise Mask did, but it still quieted the world around me so I could enjoy my jams without the intrusion of subway announcements, panhandlers and unruly teens. In a sound-off with the Apple AirPods, I found that the Here One buds offered much more detail. Unfortunately for me and the rest of the Android faithful, the current iteration of the free app is iOS-only. However, developer Doppler Labs promises that the Android version will launch in the near future. MORE: I Spent More Than $200 on Headphones: You Should Too Audio Performance In a sound-off with the Apple AirPods, I found that the Here One offered much more detail. For instance, I could hear all of the strings as I listened to Blackstreet's "Joy," but those details seemed to meld into the rest of the instrumentals on the AirPods. However, the AirPods also delivered an overall fuller and warmer sound.  When I switched over to Alanis Morissette's "Ironic," there was enough separation that I heard nearly every strum of the guitar as well as the snares. However, the highs on the Here One were overly bright and brittle compared with the more balanced presentation of the AirPods. The earbuds lasted 1 hour and 35 minutes before a friendly female voice let me know that the end was near. Comfort and Stability Unlike when I’ve worn other of the truly wireless earbuds, I've never felt worried about one of these buds popping out of my ears to somewhere out of reach. A simple twist backward into place snugly secured the Here One buds into my ear canals. They even stayed put when I tried to run for the M7 bus. In terms of comfort, I prefer the Here One to both the AirPods and the Bragi The Headphone. Once the Here One buds were in place, I sometimes forgot I was wearing them — well, other than when the music reminded me. Although the Here One fit me right out of the box, Doppler Labs also includes several pairs of ear tips in both silicone and foam. MORE: 12 Cheap Earbuds (Under $20) Ranked from Best to Worst Battery Life and Bluetooth As fun as it is to switch between audio filters and create my own, doing so soon took a toll on the Here One's battery. The earbuds lasted 1 hour and 35 minutes before a friendly female voice let me know that the end was near; about 10 minutes later, the buds shut down. That's 15 minutes short of the 2 hours that Doppler Labs claims the headphones should get. If your earphones conk out in the midst of your travels, the carrying case can charge the Here One up to three times before it needs to be recharged. That's fine, but that meant I was left at the mercy of the NYC subway system and its cacophony before I could get to charge the buds. During my travels, I noticed that the Bluetooth connection between the phone and the Here One would drop out unexpectedly. This happened even though the phone was in my hands and well within range of the buds. Even more puzzling was that the music continued to play. However, I couldn't access any of the audio filters in the app, so I had to restart the app and re-pair the buds. With all the fancy tech crammed inside the Here One, I wouldn’t have expected that to happen. During one call with my mom, she thought I was in the office when I was actually in a semicrowded coffee shop, getting some hot chocolate. Call Quality What a difference a filter makes. Whether I was in a crowded restaurant or walking down a particularly windy street, I never heard any complaints when fielding calls from friends and family. During one such call with my mom, she thought I was in the office when I was actually in a semi-crowded coffee shop, getting some hot chocolate. Although I would hear a faint echo every now and then on my end of the call, my callers' voices were clear and conversationally loud. MORE: Buying Headphones in: Pros and Cons of Every Type Bottom Line The future of audio lies in augmented listening — but it’s not quite here yet. For $299, Doppler Labs has given listeners the power to control how and what they hear. It's pretty heady stuff when you get right down to it. However, less than 2 hours of battery life on wireless buds is no good, no matter how cool your new bionic ears are. Though they don't offer cool audio filters, the Apple AirPods get 5 hours of battery life, as well as warm, albeit sometimes muddy, audio quality. Still, if you’re an early adopter and want to live on the bleeding edge of tech, the Hero One earbuds might be worth the splurge.

As a matter of fact, I'm still pretty irritated with the company over the whole Note7 fiasco. However, as a frequent Tom's Guide reader, I felt compelled to address this article. You seem to think this is something new? Samsung has already released all of these features in their IconX buds. They do suffer from the same pitfalls as the Here One; short battery life and somewhat buggy connectivity. However, they've been out for quite a while and they feature the "augmented listening" via the ambient sound feature which is activated by holding your finger on one of the earbuds for a few seconds to activate the feature. They charge in the case, which, if the pictures included in this article are accurate, the IconX case is way smaller. It's also shaped like a capsule, with no right angles, so it doesn't dig into your leg if you have it in your pocket. The IconX also contains 4 GB of on-board memory for you to store audio files, eliminating the need for you to carry your smartphone with you if you take them out to the gym. They have a sleek, minimal appearance, with no protruding "sticks" like the crude appearance of Apple's AirPods, which like you said before, look like "earbuds with the cords lopped off". Someone on Apple's design team ought to be slapped for that idea. Lastly, they have a bio sensor built into each bud, which automatically senses when you've inserted each one into your ear and powers them on. The sensors also track your physical activity, giving you verbal feedback on speed, distance, duration, heart rate, and calories burned, all reported to you by an audible "friendly female voice" which can be set to communicate in 15 different languages. The ONLY feature I see with the Here One buds that is unique, is the different ambient sound modes. However, at over $100 USD more than the IconX, I see no reason that you'd want to spend more than necessary to have an equal or lesser experience with the Here One buds. 0 Comment Firstname Submit Also for wearables Editor's choice Bose QuietComfort 25 10/10 Perfection $299.00 Amazon Editor's choice Bose QuietComfort 35 9/10 Superior $349.99 Amazon Editor's choice V-Moda XS 9/10 Superior $161 Amazon The Latest On Tom’s Guide News 4 hr Sonos Expands Home Theater Speaker Lineup With Playbase How-To 8 hr How to Turn Off Location Services on iOS How-To 9 hr Samsung Galaxy S5 User Guide Round-Up 10 hr Best Mobile Strategy Games Deals 10 hr Score a Free $60 Gift Card with Your GoPro Hero5 Purcha...

Most recently, it was reported that Apple is considering a “transformative acquisition” in content creation. Many Apple fans, however, have expressed doubt when it comes to the company’s original content efforts. How big of a focus do you think Apple should be putting on original video content? Take Our Poll Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case Apple is already somewhat invested in original video content. The company will debut its realty series “Planet of the Apps” this year, as well as its spin-off of James Corden’s popular Carpool Karaoke series. These efforts, however, don’t appear to be everything the company is working on. Since Apple first announced its original content efforts, however, there has been much debate as to whether or not this is a good strategy for the company. Many Apple users have expressed concern that Apple is neglecting its hardware and software offerings in favor a new, Hollywood-first approach. With these concerns in mind, though, it’s still unclear as to how extensive Apple’s original video content efforts are. A report last year claimed that Apple itself wasn’t even sure how to handle its move into original content, claiming that it wasn’t necessarily willing to commit to the level of a company like Netflix, but also that it wasn’t sure where the happy-medium was. Additionally, Eddy Cue has said in the past that Apple isn’t necessarily looking to compete with Netflix. Additionally, more recent report claimed that Apple’s efforts related to original content are a bit unorganized at this point, with Eddy Cue, Jimmy Iovine, and Robert Kondrk all holding seperate conversations with media powerhouses. Tim Cook puts Apple’s focus original content efforts like this: “In terms of original content, we have put our toe in the water doing some original content for Apple Music, and that will be rolling out through the year. We are learning from that, and we’ll go from there. The way that we participate in the changes that are going on in the media industry — that I fully expect to accelerate from the cable bundle beginning to break down.” Personally, I hold the opinion that Apple should put a light focus on original content and instead direct attention to creating products and platforms on which creatives and companies can produce content and reach the mass market. With the iOS and tvOS platforms, there’s no reason that Apple itself should need to create an overwhelming amount of content. Apple, however, should negotiate with major companies and studios to obtain rights to content and encourage those studios, networks, and companies to develop applications for tvOS and iOS.

The new Assistant is Google’s version of Apple’s Siri, Microsoft’s Cortana, and Amazon’s Alexa. Although late into the AI game, Google Assitant has one major advantage over every other AI-based digital assistant software: the Google/Android connection. Google, who has been branching out of its humble search engine beginnings for years, bought Android in 2005. This seemingly simple move allowed Google to expand from desktops to smartphones. According to Quartz, Android hit a record-breaking 88 percent of the smartphone market last year. Android’s success can be attributed to partnering with many smartphone manufacturing partners, while Apple’s IOS has a much smaller market share since it is only available on Apple devices. However, the Google Assistant was not supposed to be used throughout the entire Android universe. Google’s initial strategy was to roll out the Google Assistant on Pixel (Google’s high-end smartphone), and Google Home. Google changed their strategy when Amazon’s Alexa made it even easier to shop online. Since Shopify reports that retail eCommerce sales are projected to grow to over 3.4 trillion US dollars by 2019, Amazon clearly wanted to capture a larger piece of that ever-growing market. Amazon pushed to install Alexa in a wide variety of IoT products was Google’s motivation to change tactics, as reported by CNBC. “The U.S. technology giant’s move comes after Amazon continues to aggressively push Alexa onto new devices. At CES, Amazon announced Alexa would be integrated with LG refrigerators and even Ford cars. But it began to step on Google’s feet when Amazon announced that Alexa would be on the Huawei Mate 9 smartphone in the U.S., which runs Android. “Amazon has taken an early lead with Alexa and Google needs to exploit the enormous reach of Android smartphones to rapidly get the Google Assistant into the hands of consumers before they get wedded to the Alexa ecosystem.” [Image by guvendemir /iStock] The race to dominate the AI market quickly forced Google to tap into its huge Android market. According to a report by Pocket-lint, Google has confirmed Google Assistant will be available for Android 7.0 Nougat and 6.0 Marshmallow phones, including: Samsung Galaxy S7 Samsung Galaxy S7 edge HTC 10 HTC U Ultra LG G5 LG V20 Sony Xperia XZ Huawei P9 Google has also released Google Allo, a messaging app that uses Assistant technology. This would allow more Android phones to use Assistant, again increasing Google’s share of the market. One slight issue, according to a CNET review, is that “Allo doesn’t integrate video calling, and it doesn’t have as many features as its competitors, like baked-in GIF support or control over read receipts.” [Image by Eric Risberg/AP Images] As technology changes and evolves, the innovations will continue to push the envelope and try to find new ways to connect with consumers. Google is the king of connecting consumers and businesses. Google’s search engine is designed to be incredibly helpful while selling advertising. Now that technology allows us to shop, search, talk, and work anywhere, tech companies will keep installing AI in places that will increase profits. By 2021, the number of internet-connected devices is predicted to reach 46 billion. In the race to become the leader of voice-activated AI, Google has a clear advantage in its huge Android market. With an 88% of the smartphone market, Google should be the clear leader. However, 9TO5Mac reports that “Apple made more revenue from iPhone in a single quarter than Google has ever made from Android.” So while Google is poised on the brink of dominating the market with its new Assistant, Google’s Android advantage may not be enough to squash its competitors.

The report claims that Cue has met with Paramount Pictures and Sony TV, though specific details of those meetings are unclear at this point. Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case Today’s report cites an unnamed source who explains that Apple is “preparing something big” in terms of original content. One executive reportedly left the meeting with Cue under the impression that Apple is looking for a “transformative acquisition and not just a deal to buy TV shows.” The report also explains, however that Apple’s original content efforts seem a bit scatter-brained at this point. Hollywood executives are reportedly unclear as to who specifically is leading Apple’s efforts, with Eddy Cue, Jimmy Iovine, and Robert Kondrk all talking to different people: “Robert Kondrk, Eddy Cue, Jimmy Iovine, everyone is trying to be the person,” one insider told The Post. “They each want to be the guy, and they’re telling people, don’t deal with the other one.” “Eddy is talking to some people. Jimmy is talking to others,” noted a second insider. “They just haven’t figured it out.” This also isn’t the first we’ve heard about Apple’s in acquisitions related to original content. Last year, it was reported that Apple had approached Time Warner regarding a potential acquisition, but ultimately Time Warner won out. Other reports, however, have suggested that Apple isn’t necessarily willing to go “all-in” with original video at this point, despite making selected efforts. Cue’s meetings with Paramount and Sony come as Apple continues to express an interest in original video content. The company is debuting its reality series “Planet of the Apps” later this year, as well as its spin-off of the viral Carpool Karaoke series. As Apple continues to put a focus on Services, original content would allow for yet another revenue stream as part of that category. Though, it still seems as if Apple doesn’t exactly know what it wants to do when it comes to creation original content. So, as of now, only time will tell what the future holds.   Chance Miller @ChanceHMiller Chance covers Apple for 9to5Mac and contributes to 9to5Google, Electrek, and 9to5Toys.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple Invents Next-Gen Fabrics that could one Day be used for iDevice Housings and Beyond | Main | Apple Struggled in the Education Market in 2016 as Schools on Tight Budgets Chose Chromebooks » March 04, 2017 Apple Caught in another Controversial Story about Supporting Slave and Child Labor in Congo On February 15 Patently Apple posted a report titled "Apple's Need for Slave Labor Clearly Overrides their Argument that a U.S. Plant is Impossible due to Supply Chain Issues." This week another shocking report was published by the U.K's Sky News about cobalt mining in Congo that widely uses child labor as young as four years old to dig for cobalt with their hands. Apple and Samsung use cobalt in their respective smartphones and the children get 10 to 12 cents a day (8 pence) to work in the mines. Is that not slave labor? While you can window dress it or simply deny it's even happening, it is what it is: slave labor.   The source is Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt Company, a Chinese firm that is the largest buyer of artisanal cobalt in Congo and whose minerals are used in Apple products.Yet only after the story broke did Apple decide to make a statement that they would stop buying cobalt mined by hand in Congo until conditions improve and child labor is stopped.   If a reporter was able to find out about the conditions of the mine and even film it, then why couldn't Apple have found that? Especially after the searing report by the BBC in 2014 accusing Apple of closing their eyes to child labor and poor working conditions at other mines, you would think that they would have doubled their efforts so as to never be caught supporting such suppliers in the future. But once again Apple has shown their concern after the fact.   The Washington Post reported on this on Friday by stating that "Last year, Apple pledged to clean up its cobalt supply chain, but the technology giant said it wanted to avoid hurting the Congolese miners by cutting them off. Mining provides vital income for hundreds of thousands of people in what is one of the world's poorest countries. Now, Apple says it has stopped — for now — buying cobalt from artisanal mines."   While Apple knew about this for a year, it's only now that the mine was recently on TV for all the world to see that they moved quickly from talk to PR damage control and action. Yet in the end, the iPhone machine must stay on schedule and Apple will do whatever they have to do to ensure they get their iPhones to market. That's the brutal reality, child labor or not.     The Sky News report went on to add that "None of them wore gloves or masks, yet the World Health Organization says exposure to cobalt and breathing in its dust fumes can cause long-term health problems.   Certainly, many of those involved in the mining industry believe they're suffering poor health as a result.   Makumba Mateba has a huge tumor on his throat which he believes has grown because the water in his village is contaminated by cobalt mining.   He said: "We only drink the water which comes from the mining sites after all the minerals have been washed in it.   "It comes right through our village and I drink it and I'm sure it's that which has made me sick."   Becha Gibu, a doctor in the village of Kimpesa, said many of the babies he delivered had mysterious illnesses. You could read more about the report here.   At the end of the day, it's very difficult not to read about this story and see the film and not see it as total hypocrisy from a company who takes up human rights issues in the United States oh-so loudly and publicly. Apple could have dealt with this issue a year ago according to the Washington Post, yet basically chose not to in the hopes that it would all just fade away with the next news cycle. And it did until last week.   While this is definitely an industry problem, most Apple fans expect more from Apple than PR statements and shifting work to another slave camp not under scrutiny in order to get the material they need for iDevices.   But now take a deep breath, look in the mirror and ask yourself: Will I stop buying my favorite tech toys to save the children around the world from slave labor and unhealthy work conditions? If we collectively did just that, the industry would move heaven and earth to address the issue overnight to stop their stocks from crashing.   Yet honesty tells us that 99% of consumers will pretend they didn't see the video or read the story about this issue. The majority of consumers will excuse it away just like the companies do. So before anyone screams at Apple too loudly, will you make the needed sacrifice to help the children in labor camps? I didn't think so, and companies like Apple, Samsung and others know that all too well.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

(AAPL) Apple Music Just Can’t Catch Spotify Apple Music is growing rapidly, but so is Spotify ... and the streaming music leader has hit 50 million paid subscribers By Brad Moon, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Mar 4, 2017, 11:45 am EST Get AAPL alerts: Submit     View All   Popular Posts: Apple Inc.

(AAPL) Apple Music Just Can’t Catch Spotify Apple Inc. (AAPL) iPhone 8 Lightning Port Drama Continues Apple Inc. (AAPL) Posts Best Q4 Apple Watch Sales Ever View All Posts Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) Apple Music is a success by all counts, but one target still remains elusive. Despite impressive subscriber gains since its 2015 launch, AAPL’s streaming music service has been unable to catch primary rival Spotify. And in the latest sign that the competition is far from over, Spotify just announced it has hit the 50 million paid subscriber mark. Spotify Hits 50 Million Paid Subscribers Apple Music and Spotify are considered to be the two big players in the streaming music war. Spotify launched in 2008, giving it a long lead in which to build up steam over Apple Music, which didn’t go live until 2015. Despite that head start — and predictions that after its initial free three-month trial expired, Apple’s streaming music service would see a big drop off of subscribers — Apple Music quickly began to gain obliterate Spotify’s numbers. Apple Music hit 10 million paid subscribers after just six months, a milestone that took Spotify nearly six years to reach. Since then, Apple Music has continued to add paid subscribers at a rapid pace: 11 million by last February, 13 million in April, 17 million in September and 20 million in December. However, despite the rapidly increasing popularity of Apple’s streaming music service, Spotify stubbornly refuses to go away. In fact, rather than stalling or beginning to slip as many expected, Spotify’s numbers have also been growing strongly. Spotify had roughly 20 million paid subscribers at the time Apple Music launched. This week, the company announced it has hit 50 million. In other words, Spotify is not going anywhere any time soon. A Little More Competition While the big streaming music battle has been between Apple Music and Spotify, many other competitors are duking it out for the dollars of music fans. And rather than scare off new entrants, the success of Apple Music led to a big new competitor taking a shot at the business. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) launched Amazon Music Unlimited last fall, matching Apple Music’s basic subscription rates. But Amazon added a twist by discounting the service for Amazon Prime members and slashing it it less than half the regular $9.99 monthly fee for owners of its Amazon Echo smart speaker. Will Apple Music Ever Catch Spotify? (And Does It Need to?) The success of Apple Music isn’t just about bragging rights.

Benchmark results reveal the upcoming smartphone’s power. The battle of the cores has been a long-standing and heated debate, more so in the past few months as Octa-core devices started to enter the scene. Samsung has always been at the forefront of the Octa-core battle, having advertised and marketed their first Octa-core weapon in 2013 in the body of the Samsung Galaxy S4. With more and more octa-core smartphones entering the scene, the question is, is an octa-core smartphone really better than a quad-core smartphone? To put things into perspective, the upcoming Samsung Galaxy S8+ (The S8+ is the internet’s term for the Galaxy S8 with the bigger screen, which, of course, could still get a different name by launch) will be another octa-core beast that will release this year. But will it be better than the Apple iPhone, which only runs with a quad-core chip? Mashable reported earlier that the first benchmark reports for the Samsung Galaxy S8+ has already made its way online via Geekbench and it is already stirring a bit of controversy. Geekbench published this week the first benchmark report for the Samsung SM-G955U, the model that is believed to ship as the Samsung Galaxy S8+, and we’ve got the benchmark scores that are making consumers wary if it’s worth investing into octa-core after all. According to the results, the single-core score for the Samsung Galaxy S8+ clocks in at 1929, while the multi-core score puts it at 6084. For the average consumer, these are all just numbers, well until we put the Samsung S8+ scores beside the other latest smartphones on the market. We have yet to receive benchmark results for the upcoming iPhone 8 (but that’s one crazy guarded secret by Apple anyway) so we compare the upcoming Galaxy S8+ with its predecessor, the premium Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, and its older competitor, the Apple iPhone 7 Plus. In comparison with its predecessor, the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, which runs on an octa-core processor as well, you’ll notice significant upgrades as the Samsung Galaxy S7 only scored an 1893 single-core, and 5670 multi-core. The Samsung Galaxy S8+ is set to outperform the Galaxy S7 [Image by Photo by David Ramos/Getty Images] However, if you check the benchmark results for the iPhone 7 Plus, you’ll get an average single-core score of 3469, which is almost twice the single core power of the Samsung Galaxy S8+. On the multi-core score, however, it gets trumped by the Galaxy S8, only scoring around 5752. Understanding how cores work is a nasty job, which Trusted Reviews tried to explain in this one article. But without getting too geeky about it, for the casual tech consumer, multi-core score usually would you give you a better understanding of how powerful a smartphone could be in real world application. Essentially, smartphones utilize multi-cores so that the phone will be able to process more work more efficiently. This means that instead of loading all the work into a single core, the smartphone divides all the work into its cores so that it gets done quicker. This is why even though some like Mens XP would regard the Samsung Galaxy S8+’s single-core score to be a reason to doubt the upcoming device, it shouldn’t really be the case. A good single-core score for the Apple iPhone 7 Plus, as reflected on Geekbench, couldn’t off-the-bat outshine the Samsung Galaxy S8’s single-core score since in the real computing world, most apps and systems would usually make use of the multiple cores, instead of dumping all the work into one core. This means that the Galaxy S8+’s multi-core score would reflect that it will be able to handle computing better and more efficiently (technically) since the way the S8+ uses its multiple cores outshines the way the iPhone 7 would use its cores. How this translates to actual computing and work could still vary, however. The Samsung Galaxy S8+’s better multi-score could mean it could outperform the Apple iPhone 7 [Image by Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images] And if we’re talking quad-cores and octa-cores already, since the Apple iPhone 7 Plus uses a quad-core processor, while the Samsung Galaxy S8+ uses an octa-core processor, it doesn’t necessarily follow that octa-core is better since it has more cores. In fact, as Make Us Of tries to explain, most octa-core smartphones are essentially dual quad-cores at most. This means that it uses two separate quad-core sets, where one quad-core set is more powerful than the other. Why use two quad-core sets, you ask? Well, the very basic way to understand is that the smartphone would delegate a set of task to the quad-core set that is most fitted for the job. If the work that needs to be completed by the smartphone, for example, only needs low power, for example messaging or just browsing your phone, the task(s) will be delegated to the lower-power quad-core set. If you need more power, i.e. gaming or HD video-viewing, then that task(s) will be delegated to the higher power quad-core set. The catch is that you get to prolong your battery life since the smartphone doesn’t need to make the more powerful quad-core set work, which uses more battery power when you just need this level of power to accomplish a certain task. In fact, if you compare some octa-core smartphones to the iPhone 7 Plus’ quad-core score, you’ll be surprised at how better the quad-core iPhone 7 Plus could perform against the octa-core. The Xiaomi Redmi 3s, for example, is an octa-core device, but can only clock in a 1672 multi-core score. The Huawei Honor 8, which is another octa-core device, only performs almost as well as the iPhone 7 Plus, achieving a multi-core score of 5471. In theory, based on how cores work and benchmark results, the upcoming Samsung Galaxy S8+ could easily outmaneuver the Apple iPhone 7 Plus. But, of course, we can’t say just yet that the Samsung Galaxy S8 could win this year’s battle of the smartphones since the upcoming Apple iPhone 8, which will be powered with a better processor, could be another story. If reports as Gadgets360‘s could be true, then we could see the power of the Samsung Galaxy S8+ with our own eyes and hands by March 29 during the scheduled “Galaxy Unpacked” event.

M Tuesday, Mar 07 2017 | Updated at 04:10 AM EST Stay Connected With Us F T R Opinion Academics Students Special Reports Sports Finance Tech Career College Mar 04, 2017 12:39 PM EST By Donna Mills, UniversityHerald Reporter Spotify Ups The Ante With Extremely High Quality Songs: Apple Music, Tidal Hurting Spotify and Apple's relationship continues to grow sour as they roll out new features to attract and keep their subscribers. Spotify is launching a Hi-Fi music experience that will deliver extremely high quality songs. (Photo : Mario Tama/Getty Images) Spotify recently hit 50 million paying subscribers, surpassing Apple Music's more than 20 million customers. The former has maintained their top standing due to its well-liked features, and Spotify is just starting when it comes to that aspect. Spotify's loyal subscribers are there due to the streaming service's consistent upgrades. Among those is Discover Weekly, a personalized playlist that showcases 40 songs that fit a user's preferred genre. To "predict" music tastes, Spotify employs an algorithm based on users' play history and download. Discover Weekly was a hit among the streaming service's followers and they only upped the ante by introducing Daily Mix or multiple, never-ending playlists. What sets Daily Mix apart from Discover Weekly is it also plays your favorite songs aside from new tracks that you might like. Daily Mixes contain 75 percent of music that you're already familiar with and 25 percent of new songs, USA Today's Las Cruces Sun-News pointed out. Spotify also offers curated playlists for when you only want to listen to a specific music genre on. You can also check out the top hit songs in your country or even internationally. Of course, Apple Music, SoundCloud and Tidal also offer these types of features, but it may be hard for those streaming services to steal Spotify's loyal subscribers especially if the latter see no reason why they should shift. Apple Music remains as Spotify's fiercest competitor. In August, Spotify reportedly punished artists who are exclusive to Apple Music by displaying or promoting their songs less. Spotify vehemently denied this, but the two companies' relationship continues to grow sour as they roll out new features to attract and keep their subscribers. Apple is planning to showcase popular programs such as James Corden's "Carpool Karaoke" on their streaming service. Spotify, on the other hand, is prepping a Hi-Fi music experience, which will feature lossless CD quality audio, The Verge reported. Lossless audio formats are still compressed, but its special algorithms maintain audio data so it sounds exactly like the original source. WAV, WMA Lossless, FLAC and ALAC are some examples of lossless formats. Lossy formats (e.g. MPS, AAC and WMA) compress audio with algorithms that delete data, meaning it's not as high-quality as the lossless ones. Lossless music, however, has disadvantages. It requires more storage and is usually unsupported on hardware gadgets like phones and tablets. Spotify's Hi-Fi service was tested this week and adds $5 to $10 per week to Spotify Premium's $10 price. Users think that Hi-Fi will hurt Tidal due to its cheaper cost and free vinyl offer.

Apple and Samsung lead the smartphone pack worldwide but impressive growth in the Chinese market has left room for a host of home-grown manufacturers to come to the fore, with China's Huawei now third in the world. Within China, Oppo surged to become market leader last year and it is expanding rapidly in Asia to stand fourth in the world rankings, even if its brand is little known in developed and increasingly stagnant Western markets. A closely related Chinese brand, Vivo, has muscled its way into fifth place globally. What this means, though, is that former Chinese market leaders, such as Lenovo and TCL Communications, are losing ground, and some are counting on retro Western brands to revive their fortunes at home and abroad. Emerging from a sea of indistinguishable smartphones, the showstopper at this year's main European technology trade fair was a revival of the Nokia 3310, its brightly coloured cases and month-long battery life tugging at the heartstrings of erstwhile fans in search of a digital detox. The new phone was launched by Finnish firm HMD Global, led by former Nokia executives and backed financially by Chinese electronics giant Foxconn, which makes devices for Apple and Sony, among others. Priced at 49 euros, the 3310 is meant to appeal to old fans in the West as well as finding a new generation of younger users in emerging markets looking for a good-looking reliable phone. The BlackBerry made a splash at the Barcelona trade fair too thanks to China's TCL Communication, which unveiled a BlackBerry-licensed handset with the physical keyboard many professionals clung onto even as Apple's iPhone revolutionised the smartphone market. BlackBerry Ltd. supplies the phone's security software. TCL, which is part of a group that makes appliances ranging from TVs to washing machines, has kept France's Alcatel brand alive for a decade. TCL-Alcatel is now the world's 10th biggest smartphone maker, according to research firm Strategy Analytics. Lenovo, the world's third largest mobile phone supplier in 2014 when it acquired U.S. cellphone pioneer Motorola, has subsequently sunk to ninth globally but is counting on Motorola as its premium smartphone brand to battle back. The Chinese firm is even open to following in Nokia's footsteps and reviving the retro, flip-top Motorola Razr, which was the second-best selling phone in the world in 2004 and 2005. International expansion Lenovo Chief Executive Yang Yuanqing told CNBC this week that launching a revamped Razr could be a way of bringing customers back to the Motorola brand as it tries to drive into developed markets such as the United States. The Philips handset brand also lives on in India and China after the Dutch firm licenced its brand to Sang Fei, a subsidiary of TPV Technology, which also makes Philips television sets. For now, though, the top Chinese phone makers such as Huawei , Oppo and Vivo, look set on developing their own brands in a domestic market that is still growing even as demand in developed economies plateaus. China accounted for more than a third of the world's mobile phones shipped last year, according to a government report. But as the market becomes overrun with me-too smartphones and margins evaporate, rivals may spot more opportunities to leapfrog by capitalising on familiar Western brands, said Strategy Analytics analyst Neil Mawston.

Frankel March 3 Follow @tcfrankel A boy carries a bag used to transport cobalt-laden dirt and rock at a mineral market outside Kolwezi, Congo, on June 7. A Washington Post investigation found that child labor and unsafe working conditions are part of the cobalt mining process. (Michael Robinson Chavez/The Washington Post) Apple said it has temporarily stopped buying cobalt mined by hand in Congo while it continues to deal with problems with child labor and harsh work conditions. A Washington Post investigation last year detailed abuses in Congo’s artisanal cobalt supply chain, showing how miners — including children — labored in hazardous, even deadly, conditions. Amnesty International and other human rights groups also have alleged problems. Earlier this week, British broadcaster Sky News published an investigation that alleged continued problems in the cobalt supply chain. The Post connected this troubling trade to Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt Company, a Chinese firm that is the largest buyer of artisanal cobalt in Congo and whose minerals are used in Apple products. Last year, Apple pledged to clean up its cobalt supply chain, but the technology giant said it wanted to avoid hurting the Congolese miners by cutting them off. Mining provides vital income for hundreds of thousands of people in what is one of the world's poorest countries. Now, Apple says it has stopped — for now — buying cobalt from artisanal mines. “We have been working with Huayou on a program that will verify individual artisanal mines, according to our standards,” Apple said in a statement, “and these mines will re-enter our supply chain when we are confident that the appropriate protections are in place.” Cobalt is essential for the lithium-ion batteries found in laptops and smartphones, such as the iPhone. Sixty percent of the world's cobalt supply comes from Congo. Apple has said it intends this year to begin scrutinizing its cobalt suppliers like it does its “conflict mineral” suppliers — the tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold from Congo that companies are required by securities law to attempt to certify does not come from militia-controlled mines. Apple said it plans to publish a list of the cobalt smelters, just as it does for its conflict mineral smelters. Sky News reported that children continued to be employed in the cobalt mining that feeds into Apple's supply chain. The report was centered on the former Katanga province of Congo, where Huayou Cobalt operates, although the Sky News report does not specify the locations. A Huayou Cobalt spokesman told The Post this week that it was investigating the allegations made in Sky News story and had asked the broadcaster for more details. Apple said it continues to work with local groups in Congo to improve conditions for workers and stop child labor. And once those conditions are addressed, Apple said, it hopes to resume buying artisanal cobalt. business technology the-switch true Please provide a valid email address. Sign up You’re all set!

This iOS 8.2 vs iOS 8.1 and iSO 8 comparison will walk you though the iOS 8 changes. There are five key areas that Apple focused on with the iOS 8.2 update. One of these is the Apple Watch that the company announced on March 9th, but the rest deliver a better health app, more stability, bug fixes and security updates. We’ll explain the iOS 8.2 changes and what they mean for users who are experiencing iOS 8.1.3 problems. The iOS 8.2 release arrived on Monday March 9th, but many users are just getting a notification that there is an update waiting to install with a small red bubble appearing on the Settings app. iOS 8.2 is available for every device already running iOS 8, which includes the iPhone 4s, iPhone 5, iPhone 5c, iPhone 5s, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPad 2, iPad 3, iPad 4, iPad Air, iPad Air 2, iPad mini, iPad mini Retina, iPad mini 3 and the iPod touch 5th generation.

Apple normally focuses on adding new features and fixing problems with these larger x.2 updates.

There are six specific iOS 8.2 security fixes in the update that should make the iPhone more secure. This also impacts the iOS 8.2 jailbreak, which users need to wait on. Apple fixes an error that let a remote attacker force a restart, fixed an issue that let an attacker with a privileged network position execute arbitrary code. Another fix focuses on an app that can execute code with system privileges and an issue that let a malicious app create folders in trusted locations. The iOS 8.2 update also delivers a fix that allowed an attacker with a privileged network connection to intercept SSL/TLS connections. Finally, the iOS 8.2 update fixes an issue that allowed, “A person with physical access to the device may be able to see the home screen of the device even if the device is not activated.” You can see more about the iOS 8.2 changes relating to security on Apple’s website.

Today the Indian Amazon website is advertising a 32GB iPhone 6 in Space Gray on its homepage as a limited time offer until March 7th… AirPods This is quite curious as Apple has never produced the iPhone 6 in the 32GB variant, nor does it sell the iPhone 6 anymore. So as we noted yesterday about the 32GB Gold iPhone 6 apparently slated for a March 10 release with Taiwan Mobile, these 32GB versions popping up could potentially be new models. However, there are details that suggest the 32GB iPhone on Amazon is a reconditioned phone which is listed at 28,999 Rupees or about $435. Currently the 16GB iPhone 6 goes for 30,399 Rupees or $455 on the Indian Amazon site. For reference you can find it from about $299 in the US, however these are generally all reconditioned or used units. The seller of this Amazon promoted deal is a third-party, E-Mobiles and shows stock available now. There doesn’t seem to be any mention of whether the iPhone is new and the model number shown in the technical details is A1586 which was one of the original GSM models that didn’t include 32GB as an option. The other bit of information pointing to a reconditioned unit instead of a new model from Apple is that this 32GB iPhone 6 has a 1 year warranty from the manufacturer which is strange given the model number as well as the limited time offer. At the same time, it’s rare to hear about reconditioned iPhones with upgraded storage. E-Mobiles does seem to have a positive seller reputation, however it seems a bit odd that Amazon wouldn’t have vetted this deal more closely if either it is a reconditioned unit or the seller is not using accurate information for the product description. Some potential buyers are already asking if this product is phony and rightfully so… @duak I don't know if Gadgets360 posted this story.

Watchlist | 26 Feb 2017 | Print  | Comment (4) Apple Remote Desktop 3.9 by Agen G. N. Schmitz In version 3.9 of Apple Remote Desktop — the remote management software’s first update since early 2015 — Apple now requires OS X 10.10.5 Yosemite, but provides backward compatibility for communicating with Apple Remote Desktop clients running any version of 10.8 Mountain Lion, 10.9 Mavericks, or 10.10.4 Yosemite. (The Apple Remote Desktop Client comes with the operating system, and version 3.9 will be made available via Software Update to users running 10.10.5 Yosemite or later.) The Remote Desktop admin app also adds support for the Touch Bar on the 2016 MacBook Pro, enables administrators to export and restore an encrypted list of computers and user credentials, and enables admins to use an assistant cursor to call attention to items on a remote screen. Many users are experiencing a problem where client machines fail to authenticate and show the status “Needs Upgrade.” Reportedly, the solution is to go to Remote Desktop > Preferences > Security and select “Allow communication with older clients (less secure).” However, admins are reporting other problems as well, so it’s worth holding off on this update until the community gives it the all clear.

However, many 10.12.3 systems are failing to authenticate to other 10.12.3 systems for no obvious reason. Surprisingly, Screen Sharing is a workaround over ARD as that works (and more curiously on the second try.) Go figure!!! Reply Adam Engst   2017-02-27 17:30 Thanks for the info — sounds like it might be worth waiting for another update here. Reply Glen McAllister  2017-02-28 03:17 Definitely. I just had to restore both ARD Admin app & Client on my Mac to restore the ability to login in to an account different to the one currently logged in as, which is essential functionality, AFAIC. Had to disable SIP to restore the client in Time Machine.

Apple points to the "housings" possibly representing an iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, iPod and beyond. In fact Apple's Smart Keyboard for the iPad Pro was the first experimental device to be born from this invention.   Apple notes that a device's housing may be formed from layers of material such as fabric and polymer layers. The fabric may be formed from woven polymer yarn. The fabric may be treated with chemicals to improve stain resistance and wear resistance, may be provided with a polymer backing layer, and may receive molded plastic structures.   The fabric may be embossed to create local raised and lowered areas. Housings may be formed from tubes of fabric and fabric that has been formed by knitting, braiding, and other techniques for intertwining strands of material.   Patterned areas may be woven into the fabric, may be formed by placing coatings on selected portions of the fabric, may be formed by embroidering certain portions of the fabric, or may be formed by otherwise locally processing the fabric.   The shapes found in patent figure 14 resemble iPhone shapes shown in previous Apple patents (see one and two).   In context with the Smart Keyboard, Apple notes that "The patterned areas may form labels for keyboard keys, logos, key trim patterns, and other features for an electronic device. Patterned areas may have locally enhanced light transmission characteristics and may be backlit" – a feature that may be coming to a future generation of the Smart Keyboard.   Apple clearly spells out the scope of this invention beyond the Smart Keyboard. Apple notes that the invention covers "electronic devices with structures such as housing structures that are formed using fabric such as a tablet computer, laptop computer, a desktop computer, a display, a cellular telephone, a media player, a wristwatch device or other wearable electronic equipment and headphones."   Beyond accessories, the invention could also be applied to "electronic equipment associated with furniture or a vehicle, equipment in a building, or other suitable electronic device."   Apple's patent application was filed back in Q3 2015. One of Apple's engineers is in fact Apple's Product Design Engineer for Soft Goods and Materials. Another engineer worked at Nike on their Flyknit shoes. Apple snagged Nike's design director Ben Shaffer in 2013, the man behind Flyknit, Considering that this is a patent application, the timing of such a product to market is unknown at this time.   Patently Apple presents a detailed summary of patent applications with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each such patent application is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trade Office. Readers are cautioned that the full text of any patent application should be read in its entirety for full and accurate details.

However, the company has managed to surprise everyone by quietly unveiling a new variant of the iPhone 6. To recap, the iPhone 6 came out in September 2014 in 16GB, 64GB and 128GB models. Apple has now added another gold colored 32GB 2017 edition to the lineup. The catch here is that the iteration has only shown up in Asian markets where it’s being offered with select carriers. This confusing state of affairs means that the new 32GB option is not being sold via Apple channels like its retail stores or site. The company’s still offering up the 4-inch iPhone SE as the official low-end option in Asia. Also Read: The iPhone 8 is coming out later than you think The 32GB iPhone 6 (2017) has apparently been around in China since February. Telecom brand Taiwan Mobile is now reportedly launching the handset under its banner on March 10. The carrier is pushing the device as a special limited-edition promotion and touting the fact that the variation is the cheapest iPhone to ever be offered on its network. This brings us to the price of the 32GB iPhone 6. Taiwan Mobile is giving away the smartphone for free bundled with a TWD 1399 (roughly $45 or Rs 3000) monthly contract plan for 30 months. It’s unclear if Apple plans to release the variant in other countries as of now. Given the fact that Apple itself didn’t announce or publicize the 32GB iPhone 6, there’s a chance it’ll never make the trip to markets like the US. Perhaps the option is meant as a way to attract customers on the hunt for a cheaper iPhone and don’t want to opt for the smaller iPhone SE.

You’ll get the most value by starting at the beginning, however you can also use the series overview if you’d like to go buffet style. Note for regular readers, the already tech savvy, and IT professionals: this series is designed as a resource you can share with those you are helping or for those looking to become tech savvy on their own. How to navigate your Mac with confidence and ease Background, Expectations, & Best Practices Last week we covered building confidence and ease with iPhone and iPad navigation by dialing in to five different features and how they work. We’ll do the same today looking at macOS (previously known as OS X) which is Apple’s operating system for Macs. AirPods Like Apple’s iPhone and iPad which are known for high overall user friendliness with iOS, macOS for the Mac also has the same reputation. However, like I mentioned in last week’s post, even with arguably the most user-friendly desktop operating system, not everything will always feel obvious or clear until you learn it and make it a habit. Let’s start with one of the most useful features for easy navigation on your Mac. Spotlight Apple’s search tool in macOS is called Spotlight. It has been around since 2005 (brought to iOS in 2009) and continues to become more useful and feature rich with each update. There are many ways Spotlight will help you navigate your Mac with more confidence and ease. One of the biggest benefits is it will often be the fastest and easiest way to find what you are looking for, let’s take a look… Pull up Spotlight by either clicking the magnifying glass icon in the top right corner of your screen or pressing ⌘ command – Space bar. Give a try to searching for anything you have on your Mac, or even things that aren’t 🤓. As shown in the example below, typing in “movies” brings up current movies that are now playing as well as files on my Mac and other related items. Double-click on the listed files and items on the left side to launch, or you can also click on the content on the right side of the Spotlight search window. Some of my favorite things use Spotlight for include launching apps, pulling up contact cards, doing math, and finding content when I know the name or what’s included in the file but forget where I saved it. For a full look at all the things that you use Spotlight for navigate to System Preferences → Spotlight. You’ll now see a window that shows all the categories of content that Spotlight will show in the search results. This will help give you more direction on how to utilize the feature. You can also uncheck any category to limit what you see in Spotlight searches. I highly recommend using the shortcut to activate Spotlight (⌘ command – Space bar) which will help make it a habit to use regularly. Menu bar The Menu bar is the bar that sits at the top of your Mac’s screen. By default it’s always there (although you can set it to hide and show automatically in System Preferences → General) and will always show the application that is currently being used on the far left. On the right hand side you’ll find Menu bar icons for specific apps and macOS utilities. Looking to the right after the keyhole icon (1Password) we have Time Machine, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, AirPlay, Battery, Date, Spotlight, Siri, and Notification Center. If you haven’t done so before, click around and get a better feel for all that you can do with the Menu bar. If you’re coming from Windows, note that Preferences for each application is usually found by clicking on the applications name such as iTunes in the photo below. You’ll also find the option to Quit the application in this drop down menu. Dock The Dock in macOS is the rectangular bar at the bottom of your screen with applications and more. It stays visible by default, but like the Menu bar you can change it so that is hides and shows automatically when you hover your mouse over the bottom of your screen (or wherever you have your Dock positioned). One click on apps in the Dock will launch the application. Notice that any application that has a black dot below it is currently open. Right click on an application to get options like Quit and more (to right click, perform a two-finger click on a trackpad, hold the control key and click or right click with your mouse). One way to change the Dock’s settings is by navigating to System Preferences → Dock where you can adjust the size, magnification, position, and more. One nice trick to know if you’re having trouble quitting an app is using the keyboard to press ⌘ command – option – esc. This will launch the Force Quit Applications window. Select the app that won’t quit, and click Force Quit (most times Not Responding will appear next the app having issues). Finder One last aspect to cover for now is Finder. Think of this as your tour guide for macOS. You can launch Finder by clicking the blue and white smiling app icon in your Dock, or by using Spotlight. Here’s a look at a Finder window’s anatomy… This Finder window shows All My Files which is selected from the Sidebar on the left. Take some time to navigate and change some of the various settings like view options, arrange options, etc. to get a better feel for how to modify and navigate with Finder more effectively. You can rearrange the order of the locations and items in the Sidebar list and also drag new locations and folders to it for quick access. Another thing to keep in mind is that you can have multiple Finder windows open at the same time, just like web pages in Safari or other applications. Try the shortcut ⌘ command – N to open a new Finder window (Finder also support opening new tabs instead of using separate windows). You can also click File next to Finder in the Menu bar to open additional Finder windows and more. Do This 1. Go through each of these features another time or two to get a good feel for them. 2. As you continue using your Mac, make a deliberate effort use Spotlight more often to navigate your Mac more and more efficiently and effectively. 3.

The post has since been taken down, but initially included the caption: “How did I end up in the studio with Dr Dre ON THE night his deal went public that he did with Apple 3.2 BILLION!!!!! The BEATS HEADPHONES JUST CHANGED HIP HOP!!!!!!” WATCH: The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Financial Times reported the story Thursday citing sources briefed on the talks. Beats by Dre headphones‘ annual sales revenues have reportedly gone up to $1.5 billion since the company was founded with music executive Jimmy Iovine began selling headphones in 2008. The deal would include the new Beats Music streaming service, which Apple is likely acquiring to compete with streaming services like Pandora and Spotify after the company’s iTunes Radio failed to impress the industry. Apple’s revenue growth has declined sharply in recent years, and the company only entered the broadly popular streaming market last year — late because of former CEO Steve Jobs’ reported unfavorable opinion of music subscription services. The company continues to be the largest seller of music downloads, but is losing market share to companies like Amazon. Purchasing Beats would mark Apple’s largest acquisition ever. The headphones retail between about $169.95 to $449.95, depending on model and features, and despite many music and sound industry experts describing their quality as “extraordinarily bad,” the brand has become enormously popular as a fashion item among a younger consumer base, and the popular alternative to standard earbuds models. Beats’ success is due in large part to its wide profit margins – despite the steep prices of the popular bass-heavy headphone models, each individual unit reportedly only costs around $14 to produce. Private equity firm Carlyle Group invested $500 million in Beats last year, and valued the company at more than $1 billion. Neither Apple nor Beats would comment on the deal in the original reports, and the briefed sources said they were still in the negotiation stage. Though the companies have yet to consummate the agreement, and it could still fall through, if things go as planned the official announcement could be made as early as next week.

The iPhone 7 successor will reportedly include a USB-C port rather than Apple's Lightning connector, according to The Wall Street Journal. The Apple-designed Lightning port has been the standard on the company's smartphones since the iPhone 5 launched in 2012. Apple declined to comment on the report. Read more: The 20 tech accessories everybody should have The change would mark a significant shift for Apple, which has traditionally made its own chargers that aren't compatible with devices from other companies. Other technology firms, like Google, HTC and LG, have all moved towards USB-C in their devices. Even Apple has embraced USB-C in its updated line of MacBook and MacBook Pro laptops, all of which include USB-C ports only. (USB-C offers faster data transfer and other benefits over previous versions of USB.) Still, the change could be frustrating for longtime Apple users, who may require an adapter to use Lightning accessories with a USB-C iPhone, assuming they are compatible at all. Read more: Everything we know about the iPhone 8 The report also furthers speculation that Apple will offer an iPhone model with a curved screen, as it says the company has ordered enough parts for mass production of such a device. The news comes after the Journal reported in November that Apple had been considering such a change. Nikkei Asian Review also said in August that Apple will release a new iPhone model with a curved screen. This could enable Apple to better compete with rival Samsung, which has been releasing smartphones with rounded screens since 2014. Other reported changes for the next iPhone, which will arrive around the 10th anniversary of the device's initial launch, include facial recognition and wireless charging.

The iPhone will likely ditch the Touch ID button. Credit: Denys Prykhodov/ShutterstockMore The iPhone will likely ditch the Touch ID button. Credit: Denys Prykhodov/ShutterstockApple is expected to come out with a major new iPhone release this year — either called the iPhone 8 or maybe the iPhone X, if the company makes a nod to the phone's 10th anniversary. The next iPhone will reportedly feature an all-new glass design and come with a curved OLED screen instead of the standard LCD display Apple has used for all of its previous iPhones, according to reports. Should Apple opt for this new design, it will mean that the display will nearly cover the entire face of the iPhone, leaving no room for a physical home button. In its place, Apple may opt for a virtual fingerprint sensor that can replace its physical Touch ID sensor, but still allow you to authorize payments via Apple Pay and unlock your device. Instead of working with a third-party company like Synaptics or Qualcomm to deliver fingerprint sensing in its iPhone 8, the company will reportedly go it alone. Apple will use its own Authentec algorithm and glass identification technology from a company called Privaris to replace Touch ID, Digitimes reports, citing sources who claim to have knowledge of its plans. MORE: Apple Has A Killer Feature Planned for iPhone 8 Some reports have suggested that Apple's technology would allow you to tap anywhere on the screen to activate Touch ID, while others have said that Apple is planning a "function area" in its screen that would house the Touch ID features. Opting for its own solution instead of turning to existing technologies as the Digitimes report suggests would be a notable move by Apple. Both Synaptics and Qualcomm have already developed technologies that can identify fingerprints through a touchscreen, which would ostensibly provide a quick solution to Apple's problem. However, Apple wants to create its own technology using its own algorithms to differentiate its iPhone 8 from all other devices. It's a tack Apple has used quite successfully with its Touch ID physical button. Beyond the algorithm and glass identification technology, Apple might also use ultrasound to determine whether a person's fingerprint is authorized to interact with the device, according to Digitimes' sources. In other words, get ready for a big iPhone update this year.

Bloomberg photo by Chris Ratcliffe.   Marie Mawad Bloomberg     Huawei Technologies and LG Electronics are ushering in new smartphones that each hopes will fill a void created by the absence of a new handset from the usually dominant Samsung Electronics Co. Leading up to the Mobile World Congress recently in Barcelona, LG hosted an event to show off its new G6 smartphone with and edge-to-edge display -- no plastic or metal bezel around it. Huawei updated its flagship line, introducing the P10 phone with Leica camera technology and curved edges at its own event. With Apple skipping the gathering as it has in previous years and Samsung introducing new tablets instead of phones, Europe's technology mecca is a prime stage for smaller handset makers striving to become household names. Both Huawei and LG over the past years have gone from low-cost, basic phones to products that rival the features of Samsung's Galaxy or Apple's iPhone at cheaper prices. "As the two leading players continue to battle for the top spot, several Chinese vendors have solidified their position as valid contenders," Anthony Scarsella, a research manager at IDC, said in a report this month. "They will need to find growth beyond their home turf to eventually knock off either Samsung or Apple at the top." LG and Huawei will also face competition from two brands with European and U.S. roots. HMD Global, which has licensed the Nokia brand for its devices, unveiled the Nokia 3 and Nokia 5 smartphones that will each sell for under 190 euros ($200), along with a new version of its Nokia 3310 feature phone. Lenovo Group, which acquired the Motorola handset business three years ago, showed the Moto G5 and Moto G5 Plus premium devices. Sony and Line Corp., Japan's most popular messaging service, said they are considering joining forces to develop devices powered by artificial intelligence. While Samsung and Apple continued to dominate global smartphone sales last year -- with about 21 percent of shipments for the Korean company and almost 15 percent for its Cupertino, California-based rival -- they both lost ground to China's Huawei, Oppo and Vivo, IDC's report showed. Samsung's reputation among U.S. consumers crumbled after the Galaxy Note 7's recall and eventual abolition unearthed flaws in the Korean company's product safeguards, according to a report published earlier this month. The South Korean giant has presented its newest flagship smartphone at or just ahead of the Barcelona event for several consecutive years, though not this time around. Instead, the company showed two new tablets and said its newest flagship will start selling on March 29. Meanwhile, expectations that the next iPhone will drive a resurgence in sales have been boosting Apple shares this month. The latest available model, the iPhone 7, failed to persuade as many existing customers to upgrade as its predecessor did. Huawei, which has vowed to displace Apple and Samsung from the top of the global smartphone rankings in five years, aiming for market share of 25 percent globally, reached double-digit share of smartphone shipments for the first time in the fourth quarter of last year, at 10.6 percent of a total of 428.5 million units, according to data by IDC. For Asian manufacturers, Europe is a good place to start before targeting the U.S., and that may be increasingly true amid President Donald Trump's "America First" rhetoric. Cheaper phones have done well in countries like Spain, where mobile subscriptions are sold without a handset subsidy. In Italy, subsidies are still a core part of carrier strategies, but there are also consumers who buy prepaid packages -- and with them phones that aren't as expensive upfront.

"I knew after being in combat situations that I wanted to do things that will help protect and train soldiers and make it safer for them," he said. Washington Post photo by Bill O'Leary   Thomas Heath The Washington Post     Shahar Abuhazira knows about dark places. He had the dicey assignment of crawling into tunnels to find terrorists as an infantry officer with the Israeli Defense Forces. "These are small and narrow places, a very dangerous environment," the businessman said. Those missions prepared Abuhazira, 36, for his work as the chief executive of a Gaithersburg, Maryland, company called Roboteam. It sells high-tech robots capable of carrying out at least some of the dangerous tasks he once performed, whether for a National Guardsman patrolling tunnels on the border of Mexico or a soldier in Gaza, Afghanistan, Syria and Iraq. "I knew after being in combat situations that I wanted to do things that will help protect and train soldiers and make it safer for them," said Abuhazira, an accountant by training. He also knew he wanted to create a successful defense business. He has ventured into a crowded field against experienced rivals such as defense giant Northrop Grumman and QinetiQ North America, a publicly held company based in Britain. Roboteam's mechanical troops keep the soldier/operators far from the unknown. The machines can snoop around corners, climb up and down stairways, case an empty building, listen for a conversation, cut a wire and even disarm a bomb. Roboteam was started in 2009 and has grown to more than 100 employees, three-quarters of whom are U.S. military veterans. That makes sense: 95 percent of its $50 million in annual revenue is generated in the United States. "The smartest thing I did is to hire only U.S. military veterans," he said. "It helped us to get to the customer by better understanding the needs and developing the solutions that the warfighter will love." Abuhazira said that Roboteam is profitable. He would not say how profitable. The company has sold nearly 1,000 remote-controlled gadgets to governments in 20 countries, including Australia, Poland, France, Italy, Israel, the United States, Britain and Canada. The machines are designed in Tel Aviv and Maryland, and are built in factories in Pennsylvania and Baltimore. Roboteam's big sell is making a tool so simple that anyone can use it. There is no need to have a computer specialist helicoptered in or have an officer assigned to the unit as "the robot guy." The business model is taken from a page of the Apple playbook. "Apple took a phone that is more sophisticated than any other phone, but made it with only one button," Abuhazira said. "They made the phone very simple and intuitive. This is what we wanted to do with robots." Another piece is the ability to adapt the gadget to the customer's needs. Roboteam releases new versions of its machines once a year, similar to the frequent revisions Apple makes to its iPhones. As Abuhazira sees it: "We brought the Silicon Valley approach to the defense market." The gizmos are so light that you can hoist one onto your back. The IRIS (Individual Robotic Intelligence System) robot reminds me of the toy Tonka trunks I used to play with. (My mother took them away a decade ago.) The IRIS sells for $15,000 and is designed to strap to a soldier's thigh. Soldiers toss it through a window or around a corner so the little robot, which is built to always land upright, can sniff out danger on the other side of the wall. The sales pitch is that the tablets used to operate the robots are so simple that a soldier needs zero training with them. "You throw it and just work with it," he said. "You don't need your commander or someone. You don't need a manual. You have one button, and it's simple to operate." Roboteam's timing could make it a fortune. The U.S. military is in the midst of replacing 7,000 robots that it has purchased since the beginning of the Iraq War in 2003, according to National Defense, a publication that covers military business and technology. Abuhazira said that the company six months ago received $50 million from Israeli and Singapore investors that will help it ramp up production to meet the demand and perhaps even get into the consumer market. In addition to the IRIS, Roboteam manufactures two other models. The big seller is the MTGR -- for Micro Tactical Ground Robot -- which is about 28 pounds and sells for $70,000 per unit. The MTGR accounts for around a third of the company's revenue. The battery-operated robot runs for up to four hours and has up to eight day-and-night cameras spanning 360 degrees. There is even a microphone for telling the bad guys to surrender. The soldier can run the MTGR from a tablet the size of a iPad from up to 1,600 feet away. The MTGR is used mostly for tunnels and culvert inspection to find or spy on the enemy. The third big gizmo in Roboteam's arsenal is the Probot, which is essentially a mini-trailer the size of a riding lawn mower. The Probot is designed to carry -- quietly -- nearly a ton of equipment, ammunition or even injured soldiers to places a Humvee cannot reach. The Probot comes with a "follow me" kit that allows the robot to see its squad and follow a few yards behind for 72 hours. Roboteam was founded in late 2009, by Yosi Wolf and Elad Levy. Both Wolf and Levy once served in the Israeli Air Force and came from robotics backgrounds. Levy is the chief executive of the Israeli operation; Wolf no longer works on the defense side of the business. They had an idea to bring unmanned, ground vehicles to land forces. Up until then, land robots were the exclusive domain of specialists who worked with highly explosive devices. They are known as EOD technicians, for their work on explosive ordinance devices. Several of Roboteam's staffers are former EOD technicians with U.S. military backgrounds. Wolf and Levy contacted Abuhazira through a mutual friend, and he joined the Roboteam in January 2012. Abuhazira grew up in a small city south of Tel Aviv and studied accounting and business at a campus in Beer-Sheeva after military service. "I left the military and thought, 'It will be nice to learn business and accounting,' " he said. "I knew I was not going to work as an accountant, but it helps me even today. I have strong financial capabilities." Abuhazira had experience in the military industry. After college, he had worked more than seven years at Bagira Systems, an Israeli company that develops training and simulation technology for the military. Roboteam entered the market with a splash. The first big contract came a few months after Abuhazira joined the company. It was a $9.8 million job to build and deliver 100 MTGRs to U.S. military counterterrorism units. Other contracts filtered in, including a $25 million U.S. Air Force contract for a man-carried MTGR that beat out QinetiQ and iRobot, essentially establishing Roboteam as a player, Abuhazira said. Roboteam released five products in rapid succession and won robotic competitions in the United States, Britain, Australia, Israel, Poland and Switzerland. "The thing I like the most is to support the soldiers," he said. "That's more my thing and not sitting behind a computer and running big Excel files." It also beats climbing into a dark, dangerous tunnel. roboteam Tweet This article filed under: Business Technology Washington Post BizTech Newsletter Article Comments () Guidelines: Keep it civil and on topic; no profanity, vulgarity, slurs or personal attacks.

 Here's why Microsoft's holographic genius thinks it can beat Apple and Google to win the next wave of computing Matt Weinberger Mar. 4, 2017, 8:00 AM 13,273 facebook linkedin twitter email print Microsoft Technical Fellow Alex Kipman using a HoloLens to virtually "holoport" to Mars.TED To hear Apple CEO Tim Cook tell it, augmented reality — the hot new technology for projecting digital images into the real world, Pokémon Go-style — is "a big idea like the smartphone." But to Alex Kipman, Microsoft Technical Fellow and chief inventor of Microsoft's pioneering augmented reality headset HoloLens, that's underselling it.  Augmented reality and virtual reality technology will have a far bigger impact than smartphones ever did, Kipman told Business Insider in an interview.  "The potential of these devices," he said, is that they could one day "replace your phones, TVs, and all these screens." Once your apps, videos, information, and even social life are projected into your line of sight, you won't need any other screen-based gadgetry. Kipman calls it the "natural conclusion" of mixed reality.  That's a leap forward on par with the advent of internet, which changed how people communicated and did business; the smartphone didn't really do anything new, it just put the internet in your pocket, he says. Google, Facebook, Apple, and Google-backed startup Magic Leap are all working around the clock trying to conquer the mixed reality future for themselves. But Microsoft, after missing the boat on the mobile market, is now in the enviable position of being one of the leading players in the nascent mixed reality market, thanks to its HoloLens headset. And Kipman is determined not to squander that early advantage.   Microsoft HoloLens projects virtual images into your field of view.TED While Kipman appreciates the other companies and their work — "we're all birthing a whole ecosystem" — he says Microsoft remains in first place, with the most complete platform out there. Beyond just HoloLens, Microsoft has also been investing in helping its PC manufacturer partners come up with Windows-compatible VR headsets.  Kipman has long been adamant that the HoloLens, currently available to developers for $3,000, will only be released to consumers when it's good and ready, but he says that Microsoft is still setting the pace of innovation. "HoloLens leads the way," Kipman says. The Microsoft advantage Microsoft has something of a history of swinging for the fences and missing. Kipman himself led development of the Microsoft Kinect, which sold about 29 million units before just kind of fading away. But while he says that Microsoft has had its share of "bloody noses" over the years, "they're in the past."  With HoloLens in particular and the overall Windows mixed reality strategy in general, Kipman says, Microsoft has an "authentic structural focus," giving it several key advantages in terms of both technology and how it goes about accomplishing its mission. For starters, Kipman says that Microsoft boss Satya Nadella is "the most product-driven CEO ever," with the vision and foresight necessary to lead the company into this mixed reality future. It's a critical play for Microsoft, as the continued shrinkage of the PC industry makes this a do-or-die moment for Windows. Kipman also led development of the Microsoft Kinect. Key Kinect technology later made its way to HoloLens.Flickr And in terms of the technology, Kipman says that HoloLens is only made possible because Microsoft has been investing in the necessary underpinnings for many years now. Sensor technology invented for the Kinect made its way into the HoloLens; the Microsoft Surface team helps with design and manufacture of high-end hardware; the Microsoft Azure supercomputing cloud helps power the most immersive holographic apps; Microsoft-owned game studios like Minecraft maker Mojang help make it enjoyable to use; the Windows team handles the operating system, and more examples besides. "That's the prerequisite to build a HoloLens," Kipman says.  Versus Google and Apple Not even Microsoft's peers among the largest tech companies have all those resources, Kipman says. Amazon, for instance may have the Amazon Web Services cloud computing platform, but it doesn't have a major operating system, just for starters. Indeed, Kipman says, Microsoft Windows is a big part of the puzzle. It's a popular, commonly-understood operating system that runs on a wide array of hardware, running the gamut from mega-cheap to ultra-premium. That wide array of options is complemented by the fact that Windows lets anybody, anywhere make software for it. "There's not a lot of companies that have done that," Kipman says. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella unveiled the HoloLens in 2015, around his one-year anniversary of leading the company.Stephen Brashear/Getty Images So while Apple may make the best hardware, Kipman says, the fact that it maintains such a vice grip on the App Store hurts the ability of developers to experiment. And while Google's Android is a wide-open platform for anybody to build anything, he thinks that Google is far less experienced in terms of high-end hardware. In the middle, you have Microsoft, which recently unveiled a new line of Windows-compatible virtual reality headsets, starting at a budget $299. Now, Kipman says, Microsoft Windows supports a full range of hardware that goes from the low end, all the way up to the premium $2,999 HoloLens, all compatible with a growing range of Windows software. The new Acer Windows Mixed Reality Development Edition headset, which as you may guess from the name is only for VR developers.Microsoft There's a lot of work to be done, Kipman says, starting with making these headsets more comfortable, ensuring that there's lots of great software for them, and even far-future-looking stuff like making it so you can actually feel physical resistance and even temperature from digital objects, so a virtual ski trip might actually feel windy and cold. More importantly, it's early enough that it's still anyone's game, Kipman says. Having all these advantages "doesn't mean you are going to win, by the way," Kipman says. But if you want to compete with Microsoft, he says, "you better be more focused than we are." Get the latest Google stock price here.

Instead, Apple will most likely use its own AuthenTec Algorithm, which will be teamed up with privaris-glass identification technology with the aim of redesigning its fingerprint sensor. The report also suggests that Apple’s new fingerprint technology for the iPhone 8 will be developed at TSMC’s 12-inch wafer line along with 65nm process technology. The upcoming iPhone’s production is expected to be delayed due to the redesign of its fingerprint tech and will probably begin in September. The iPhone, which was first launched in 2007, will celebrate its 10th Anniversary this year. Apple is expected to launch a significant redesign of the iPhone in 2017. Earlier Speculations also suggest that the iPhone 8 will no longer have a physical home button and is expected to have an edge-to-edge OLED display, a first for the iPhone. The fingerprint sensor on the iPhone 8 will most likely be embedded in the display and it is also expected to be equipped with biometric authentication systems such as an iris scanner or facial recognition tech. While some previous reports suggested that the iPhone 8 may have a USB-C port, fresh reports claim otherwise. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI securities has claimed that Apple will retain the Lightning port, but enable a newer fast charging protocol which is expected to use the “USB-C type power delivery”. Previous leaks have revealed that the iPhone 8 will feature a 5.8-inch display with about 5.15-inches of display area, on the same footprint as the iPhone 7. Though the iPhone 8 is likely to be the flagship smartphone from Apple this year, two other Apple phones also might launch, tentatively in July, 2017. While leaks have rendered an array of details about the iPhone 8, the actual features can only be confirmed after its official launch. likethis What's your reaction?

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile Apple’s Latest Patent Will Turn The iPhone’s Screen Into One Big Fingerprint Reader By Ramish Zafar Feb 28, 2017 15Shares Share Tweet Submit It’s no secret that Apple’s got a lot of plans or the iPhone 8. The company’s dependence on the lineup as a key driver of its revenue forces it in a tough spot every year. Without the iPhone, Apple simply cannot surprise. To that end, declining market interest in the smartphone as of late has put Cupertino in a tight spot for 217. The smartphone market is as competitive as ever and Apple needs to move fast if it wants to stay on top. Today, the USPTO has granted the company a patent that will allow for remarkable upgrades to the iPhone. Take a look below for more details. Apple’s Latest Patent Will Not Only Embed Fingerprint Recognition In The iPhone’s Display But Also Allow For On Screen Authentication Button free front displays are a major part of iPhone 8 and Samsung Galaxy S8 leaks. Similar rumors have surfaced for both the devices over the past couple of months. Out of these, Apple’s approach is more solid. Initial whispers on the rumor mill suggested that both the iPhone 8 and the Galaxy S8 will feature virtual home buttons. Since then, countless leaks have disproved this fact for the S8. However, Apple’s still going pretty strong. The latest information suggests that Apple will introduce a Touch Bar like feature on the iPhone 8. The bottom of the device’s screen will feature customizable ‘buttons’ that will change in accord with user needs. Now, Cupertino’s latest patent takes the concept further. Today’s patent outlines how an iPhone’s display will be able to recognize a fingerprint virtually anywhere on screen. Advertisement According to the patent, “An electronic device may include a touch display that includes at least one display layer, and at least one transparent conductive layer thereon defining touch sensing pixels. The electronic device may also include a finger biometric sensor carried by the touch display and that includes a finger biometric sensing layer that includes an array of transparent conductive finger biometric sensing pixels capacitively coupled to the at least one transparent conductive layer of the touch display.” So essentially, the entire screen of your iPhone will become a fingerprint sensor courtesy of an all new layer. This will add a lot of functionality and will remove the need to authenticate actions separately. For example, if you’re making a transaction via the Ap Store, rather than prompt you for separately authenticate your transaction, the iPhone will simply recognize your fingerprint as your interact with it. It’s an intersting concept that will take biometrics to the next stage. Thoughts? Let us know what you think in the comments section below and stay tuned. We’ll keep you updated on the latest.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile Apple Granted A Patent For A Digital Avatar Creation Tool For iPhone And iPad By Ali Salman Feb 28, 2017 14Shares Share Tweet Submit It’s not uncanny that Apple files a lot of patents, but it does not mean that the product or service will ever see daylight. Nonetheless, Apple has been granted a new patent by the United States Patent & Trademark Office that describes an editing and an avatar creation tool for the  iPhone and iPad. The patent is dubbed as the ”Avatar editing environment”. The patent elaborates a “virtual environment” in which an iPhone or iPad user will essentially use and app to create a digital avatar. Lets see some more details on the subject. Apple Granted Patent For An Avatar Creation Tool On iPhone Or iPad Apple explains the patent filing as a user’s “alter ego” creation tool. All this will be made possible by a batch of tools available to the user which includes various adjustment options ranging from their eyes, teeth, hair and other aspects as well. “An avatar editing environment is disclosed that allows users to create custom avatars for use in online games and other applications. Starting with a blank face, the user can add, rescale, and position different elements on the blank face, including but not limited to different eyes, ears, mouth, nose, eyebrows, hair, beard, moustache, glasses, earrings, hats, and other elements that are associated with physical characteristics of humans and fashion.” So what will be the purpose of the avatar on an iOS device? Essentially, the self created avatar will be available in all system apps of iOS. In addition to this, third party developers will also be able to get their hands on the avatar using the bundled API. This will allow the developers to add support for the avatar in their respective apps and games. Advertisement As it appears, this is not a new Apple filing but something that dates back to April of 2011. The editing environment patent was granted recently and hence its availability can now be expected in the future versions of iOS. By word, the avatar creation tool will be integrated in the operating system and could possibly arrive soon. As of now, we’re not sure how Apple deems to make use of the avatar. Would it act as a digital assistance or act as something entirely different. There will be more to the story in the near future so be sure to stay tuned with us. This is it for now, folks. What are your thoughts on Apple’s recently granted patent? Do you think Apple will add the avatar creating tool in the next version of iOS? Share your thoughts in the comments.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Rumor iPhone 8 Could Adopt the USB-C Interface and Ditch Lightning Altogether By Omar Sohail Feb 28, 2017 45Shares Share Tweet Submit Apple has had a nasty habit of killing ports before the public is ready for it and according to one report, it looks like the iPhone 8 might not feature a Lightning port anymore; it might get replaced with a far more advanced port. New Report Claims That Apple Might Drop the Company’s Lightning Port in Favor of the Industry’s Standard Type-C USB Port Switching from a Lightning port to the Type-C USB port on the upcoming iPhone 8 has been suggested by a new report from The Wall Street Journal, showing that the smartphone lineup might adopt the same interface as the one present on 12-inch MacBook. However, what seems to be bothering us right now is that why would Apple go through all the trouble to remove the 3.5mm headphone jack and use a Lightning port to remove that proprietary port and replace it with something else. The removal of the Lightning port would mean that Apple would not be able to generate revenue in the form of royalties from the manufacturers that produce a wide range of Lightning port accessories such as data cables, storage peripherals, and audio products, so from a business perspective, it might not be the greatest of ideas. Advertisement That very same report states that the iPhone 8 will also come with a curved OLED display, but no updates have been provided regarding the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus meaning that these two devices could retain the regular LCD panels that Apple has been using for quite a while now. However, the great thing about 2017 is that all three models have been rumored to come with support for wireless charging, which is a flexible approach to help consumers get over their nostalgia of the iPhone not featuring a headphone any longer. The iPhone 8 is also expected to get rid of the Touch ID interface and replace it with an iris scanner, as well as a ‘function area’ in place of the home button that could behave in the same manner as the Touch Bar on the 2016 MacBook Pro family.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Software tvOS 10.2 Beta 4 is Now Available for Apple TV 4 By Uzair Ghani Feb 28, 2017 8Shares Share Tweet Submit tvOS 10.2 Beta 4 for Apple TV 4 is now available. This pre-release build is available over the air, and to registered developers only. Fourth Beta of tvOS 10.2 Now Available on the Apple Developer Program Website Having updated its entire beta software lineup just yesterday, Apple left out tvOS 10.2 beta from the scene. Thankfully, the aforementioned software has received an update today and is not currently sitting at beta 4. Interestingly, tvOS 10.2 Beta 4 is no more than a bug fix release and improves performance around certain corners. If you have the software installed on your Apple TV 4 right now, then it’s highly recommended that you go ahead and update your set-top box without giving it a second thought. Just turn on the device, navigate to Settings > System > Software Updates. Install everything that’s available and you’re good to go. Remember one thing though: during the update process, make sure your Apple TV 4 is not in use at all. Just put down the Siri Remote and let the software do its thing first before watching that slick cat video on YouTube. Advertisement Given we are on the fourth beta of Apple’s software, it won’t be long till the final version comes knocking on our doors. Until then, make sure you keep your devices updated whenever a ping comes in from Apple. Wrap Up If you are interested, you will be pleased to learn that iOS 10.3 and macOS 10.12.4 beta can be tried out for free right now. How? The aforementioned software is available to download via Apple’s Beta Software Program. All you have to do is head over to beta.apple.com, sign in with your Apple ID, install the profile on your device, and the new update will be pushed to you over the air. Keep one thing in mind: since you are dealing with beta software, therefore expect a couple of hiccups during usage. It’s something that is to be expected during day to day usage. tvOS 10.2 and watchOS 3.2, on the other hand, are available for developers only. This means you have to shell out $99 on an annual basis to get access to the pre-release bits.

X 30 Irish women you need to know To mark International Women’s Day on Wednesday, here are 30 women who are shaping Irish life Sat, Mar 4, 2017, 06:15 Clockwise: Helen Dixon, Ruth Negga, Maeve Higgins, Marian Keyes, Sharon Horgan Dee Forbes, Marissa Carter, Tara McCarthy, Sonia Flynn, Julie Sinnamon Ruth Curran, Yvonne Farrell and Shelley McNamara, Louise O’Neill, Sinead Kane, Ciara Donlon Jules Coleman, Cathriona Hallahan, Dr Nora Khaldi, Sinead McSweeney, Annie Mac Sene Naoupu, Sarah Keane, Stefanie Preissner, Anne Anderson, Sinéad Burke Anne-Marie Tomchak, Johanne Powell, Cathy Kearney, Joanne O’Riordan, Breege O’Donoghue Previous Image Next Image Previous Images More Images         Business & entrepreneurship Ciara Donlon Entrepreneur and CEO, Theya Healthcare It has been a rollercoaster three years for Ciara Donlon. The 40-year-old former marketing executive and lingerie boutique owner founded Theya Healthcare in 2014, after she identified an issue facing some of her customers. “Women would come into the shop looking for a bra they could wear while recovering from breast cancer or surgery, and there really wasn’t anything that met their needs. They might have scarring, or have had lymph nodes removed, or be undergoing radiotherapy treatment or hormone treatment, which makes them sweat a lot. “If you put that into a synthetic bra that you have to wear 24 hours a day, every day for six weeks, it can be very uncomfortable,” Donlon says. So her solution was to create one herself. With no previous manufacturing experience, she found a designer, and established Theya to manufacture a new range of bras made from bamboo, which has antibacterial properties. Comfort and femininity were top priorities, along with features such as modesty pads and front-zip closures. “We come at it from the woman’s point of view from the very get go,” she says. In 2015, then barely a year in business, Donlon’s fledgling company won armfuls of awards, including the gong for Best Innovative Start Up 2015 by the DCU Ryan Academy, and a Bank of Ireland Startup award. The following year, Theya became an approved supplier to the British NHS, covering more than 1,200 NHS trusts in the UK, and was awarded two worldwide quality standards. Even so, she says: “I had dark days where I didn’t know if I could continue, between the stress of trying to find funding, while trying to keep everything running and grow our market. When that happened, I wouldn’t even let myself think negatively. I had to keep focused on my vision.” ADVERTISEMENT Donlon also found herself turning for support to her network of other female entrepreneurs. “I did the DCU Ryan Academy Female High Fliers Accelerator programme two years ago, and met a network of women. When you’re having those dark days, it is really important to be able to see other women who are out there doing it.” Donlon now divides her time between Ireland, where Theya is headquartered, and the family home in France she shares with her husband Laurent, and young son Senan. She’ll be spending International Women’s Day in Paris, at the Cartier Headquarters, which just announced her as a finalist in its Women’s Initiative Awards. It looks like 2017 is going to be another busy year. JOC Julie Sinnamon Enterprise Ireland CEO Julie Sinnamon is one of a number of women using her influence to bring more gender balance into the Irish entrepreneurial landscape. Sinnamon, who is chief executive of Enterprise Ireland, points out that in 2011, just seven female entrepreneurs out of a total 100 were supported by the agency. “Last year we supported 230 entrepreneurs in total, and 63 were women. Within high potential start-ups, women accounted for 17 percent, so although we still have a bit to go, globally only 8 per cent of tech entrepreneurs are female. So we are doing much better than that.” Encouraging more women to become entrepreneurs “is mission critical for Enterprise Ireland – and for me personally as a woman,” she says. Part of the challenge is putting a spotlight on the women who are succeeding as entrepreneurs. “If you don’t see it, you won’t want to be it.” But it is also about creating better support networks, especially at times in women’s lives when it can be challenging for them to lean in to work. “Coming back after maternity leave can be a real pressure point. It was for me personally. “Everyone who has been there will tell you that it gets better, but when you’re in the middle of that tough merry-go-round of constant juggling, it doesn’t feel like it. So it’s at times like that it’s really important for females to have those support networks, in addition to mixed support networks.” The entrepreneurial landscape in Ireland has already changed significantly for women over the past few years, Sinnamon says. “Ten years ago women were less willing to come forward to those networks, but today it’s much more acceptable and women really see the benefits of being able to network with people who have had similar experiences.” Before becoming chief executive of Enterprise Ireland in 2013, Sinnamon was head of global business development, and also worked in senior roles in the IDA and banking. She has an MBA in International Business from New York’s Fordham University and is an alumni of the Stanford Executive Program. The Derry native says admiration for entrepreneurship runs deep in her veins. “My grandmother on my mother’s side was a businesswoman, long before it was common. My father had a business, and my mother was very involved in it. So I think the influence of what we see as kids is key. To me, one of the really important things for female entrepreneurs isn’t the impact they’re bringing today, it is that they will be the role models inspiring the next generation of entrepreneurs.” JO’C Breege O’Donoghue Chair of the Design and Crafts Council of Ireland “Where did you get that?” “This? It’s only Penneys.” Breege O’Donoghue might not be a household name, but the brand that she presided over for 37 years most certainly is. Few things are as Irish as the Penneys humblebrag. O’Donoghue was a long-standing member of the board of Primark – better known here as Penneys – and part of a team (known in retailing as the gang of four) that oversaw the brand’s growth from 17 stores, when she joined in the mid-1970s, to more than 300 in 10 countries, most recently the US. She moved on from Primark last year, leaving her role as head of new markets, although she remains an ambassador for the brand. ADVERTISEMENT However, at the age of 72, O’Donoghue does not appear to have retirement even remotely in her sights. She immediately took up a position as chair of the Design and Crafts Council of Ireland (DCCoI). The organisation is hoping that her experience in international markets will help the council build on the Irish Design 2015 initiative. If O’Donoghue can do for the craft industry even a fraction of what she managed to do for the pile-em-high-and-sell-em cheap clothing industry, then we could soon be humblebragging “This? It’s only an original piece of handcrafted Irish design.” JO’C Jules Coleman Entrepreneur, Index Ventures Originally from Leixlip, Jules Coleman hit the headlines in 2015 when she sold the business she cofounded, Hassle.com, to German company Helpling. Founding Hassle.com in 2013 was a bit of a leap of faith for Coleman, who at 25 had been working for PwC in London for two years, following a graduate placement at Accenture. She took some time out to do her own thing, teaching herself how to code and trying her hand at her own business. Despite some scary moments – a lack of a regular wage when you are living in an expensive city will do that to you – it turned out to be a good move. The sale of the on-demand cleaning company netted Coleman and her cofounders Alex Depledge and Tom Nimmo €32 million in cash and stock. It also put Coleman on a different path. She left Hassle.com in 2016, along with Depledge, but these days, she has another role – as entrepreneur in residence at Index Ventures, an international venture capital firm that backs startups across all stages, from seed to growth. She is also a venture partner at Ignite 100. But you wouldn’t be surprised to see Coleman back creating her own business from scratch before long. CO’B Diplomacy Anne Anderson Ambassador of Ireland to the US If there is a glass ceiling in the dusty, clubby world of international diplomacy, nobody seems to have told Anne Anderson about it. The Clonmel woman joined the Department of Foreign Affairs in 1972, fresh out of UCD at the age of 19, and since then, she has steadily climbed the rungs of the diplomatic ladder. Her CV reads like a long list of firsts. In 2001, she was Ireland’s first female ambassador to the European Union; and in 2005 she became our first female ambassador to France. In 2013, she became the first Irish female ambassador to the United States, prompting Barack Obama to say it was “past time but that he was very glad to see me”. For her, it was a bitter-sweet moment. “Most professional women enjoy the sound of glass shattering. At the same time, one is conscious of the historical background against which this is happening,” she told the Irish Times. “I am very aware of that, that we had a marriage ban in the Irish diplomatic service until we joined the European Union, so there were generations of women whose talent and potential could not be fully utilised.” She immediately set about connecting with the new wave of young Irish emigrants and set one of the top items on her agenda as immigration reform – an agenda that’s likely to get even busier in the years ahead. JO’C Social campaigning Joanne O’Riordan Student and campaigner Joanne O’Riordan is one of only seven people in the world with a condition called Total Amelia, which means she was born without limbs. Not that she has let that hold her back. Her mantra is that “it’s not the disability, it’s the ability.” ADVERTISEMENT Now 20 and a student of criminology at UCC, O’Riordan, who is from Millstreet in Cork, catapulted onto the national stage in 2011, when she memorably tackled Taoiseach Enda Kenny about cuts to the disability benefit. She went on to give a keynote speech to the United Nations about technology, and put a challenge to the tech community to design a robot for her. In 2015, she was awarded the Junior Chamber International Outstanding Young Person of the Year award, and last year she led Dublin’s St Patrick’s Festival parade, making her the youngest ever grand marshal. “I have been around the globe, to New York and Japan, giving the people with a disability in this world a voice,” she said at the time. “I’m incredibly proud to be a voice for the voiceless.” At the UN, her determination not to let anything hold her back was clear: “All my young life I’ve struggled and overcome barriers. I’ve surprised doctors, strangers, friends and even my own family by what I have achieved. I don’t want to live in the shadow of others, because I want to make my own journey in life and I know if I’m given that chance I can and will succeed.” JO’C Sinead Kane Blind marathon runner Sinead Kane is a woman for whom the words ‘can’t’, ‘impossible’ and even ‘pain’ seem to have no meaning. When we speak, three weeks after she completed the incredible feat of running seven marathons in seven days on seven different continents, she is just back from a four-hour training run ahead of her next challenge – a 24-hour run in Finland that she planned to complete last weekend. She’s also in the midst of doing a PhD in Law. Yes, this is the same Sinead Kane who is 95 per cent blind. “I was doing this training run, and I was fatigued. I go through a lot of self-talk. I just said to myself, ‘Snap out of it. This isn’t supposed to be pleasure. This is a job. If you had to put in a four-hour shift filling boxes in a factory, you’d just be getting on with it. So get on with it’.” Because of her vision impairment, Kane runs with a guide runner, John O’Regan. “It’s a very trusting relationship. He knows I get very frustrated in extreme races, and I don’t have the advantage of being able to focus on scenery or spectators to get me though.” In 2015, Kane was successful in challenging the organisers of the VHI Women’s Mini Marathon to allow male guide runners to take part. “I’m always thinking two goals ahead. Some people are addicted to chocolate and some people are addicted to alcohol – I think I’m just addicted to goal setting,” she says. When it comes to challenges, Kane believes there are several still facing women with disabilities in Ireland today. There is, she points out, “a lack of understanding of the ways in which gender and disability issues interact. Women with disabilities are only beginning to become visible and their needs only starting to be addressed within the policy-making process.” Partly, this is down to organisations, networks and groups not being proactive enough about encouraging people with disabilities into their organisations. “I haven’t been approached by any women’s organisation to be patron or to be part of the decision making process,” she says. “Women in general need to challenge their own prejudices and stereotypical views of disabled women.” Completing the World Marathon Challenge changed her own definition of boundaries, she says. “Before, I used to think on a daily basis that I was tired. I used to feel cold when it was 10 degrees in Ireland. Now I know I can stand running at minus-30 in Antarctica, I feel that anything is possible.” JO’C ADVERTISEMENT Sinéad Burke PhD candidate, teacher, public speaker, writer Burke is a PhD candidate, primary school teacher, public speaker, broadcaster, blogger, fashion obsessive, and more. As winner of the final Alternative Miss Ireland title, she used her experience as a “little person” to her advantage, with her character creation Minnie Mélange, also the title of her blog. As an inspirational speaker, Burke is just that. Her talks on confidence, carving out one’s own career path, defying expectations, and becoming your best self, bring full conference and lecture rooms to attentive silence. Burke is an exceptional speaker, calm, clear and captivating. Last year, she took that style of delivery to the Late Late Show audience, with a well-received appearance on the chat show. Burke writes about fashion with a lyrical style. “Clothes are a malleable armour,” she wrote in the Irish Times, “defending us from the elements, our own emotions and others”. It’s that thoughtfulness that encapsulates her attitude. UM Technology Sinead McSweeney Twitter Ireland MD Sinead McSweeney is used to working in male dominated environments. Before she joined Twitter four and a half years ago, she worked for An Garda Siochana as director of communications; prior to that, she had a stint with the PSNI in a similar role, and spent some time in politics. She took on the role of vice president of public policy and communications before landing the managing director’s role in December. But despite the tech industry’s reputation for being somewhat imbalanced when it comes to gender representation, Twitter Ireland’s newest managing director says things are definitely improving – particularly when it comes to leadership roles in Ireland. “My eras of being the only woman in the room are behind me,” she said. “For years I’d be the only woman in the room and the youngest. That rarely happens now.” The tech sector may be under the spotlight right now but it’s by no means the only industry with the problem. Eight years in policing has taught McSweeney that diversity is a constant theme. “Increasingly if you look across technology, particularly in Ireland and across leadership, it’s becoming female dominated,” she said. “I think we need to be careful of the male dominated narrative; that becomes an obstacle in itself.” She concedes that some roles are more male dominated, but it is a tide that hopefully stays on the turn. The company – and its new MD – is committed to supporting diversity within its ranks. Resilience and respect are the two most important things to bring to the leadership role, especially when it comes to supporting diversity and discouraging any behaviour that would threaten that, whether it is down to gender, sexual orientation, religious beliefs, and so on. The example comes from the top. “You have to make it clear there is low tolerance for any of that behaviour,” she said While Twitter offers support in the form of various training – from unconscious bias to resilience training – and groups that can support different people within the workforce, McSweeney makes one important point: things start much earlier than applying for a job. “People have to want to work in an industry. The seeds are sown a long time before they fill out an application form,” she said. That means changing the perception of careers in the tech industry, something that has been a focus in recent years. “Technology is not alone in facing the diversity challenge,” she said. CO’B Cathriona Hallahan Microsoft MD When Cathriona Hallahan started in Microsoft, it was as an accounting technician around 30 years ago. The firm was just getting established in Ireland, and Hallahan was one of the first employees through the door; there were only 24 employed at the company. Since then, she has seen the company grow to more than 1,500 and it’s set to grow further, with 600 people set to join the firm in the coming months as Microsoft opens its new inside sales operation here and expands its existing operations. ADVERTISEMENT In February 2013, she took over as managing director of Microsoft Ireland when Paul Relis stepped down from the role, adding to the ranks of tech companies that had appointed Irish women to top jobs. She has never wanted to be seen as the token women though – something she has been spoken about in the past. And who would want to be? Everyone wants to be recognised for their own talents. She certainly has been. In 2014, she was named Image Magazine’s CEO businesswoman of the year, inducted into the Women’s Executive Network Hall of Fame in 2015 and is a member of the International Women’s Forum. Hallahan was also sponsor for diversity and inclusion at Microsoft for the Irish operation for a number of years, so has been at the coalface, so to speak. “What you find is women are a lot slower to take those risks. They feel like they have to be over qualified for the job before they’ll put themselves forward,” she says. “I’ve seen the unique perspective that women can bring to the boardroom. I think they have a different thought process, their style is much more inclusive, they like to listen to different perspectives before they’ll make a decision. “When I think about diversity I think about styles, opinions, not just gender. It’s about having unique perspectives, bringing people from different industries into the boardroom that can offer a different way of looking at a problem, and finding a unique solution.” That is something that Hallahan has been trying to push within her own organisation – having the confidence to put yourself forward, take opportunities and self promote. CO’B Helen Dixon Data protection commissioner Ireland’s Data Protection Commissioner was always going to have a tough job. With some of the biggest tech companies in the world locating their European operations here and attention turning to how data privacy was being treated, there was bound to be some difficult days ahead. The office is essentially responsible for the protection of the personal data of hundreds of millions of European citizens. No pressure there. Dixon took up the role in 2014, when outgoing commissioner Billy Hawkes departed. She is the first woman to hold the position. With it came a pending case by Austrian privacy campaigner Max Schrems over Facebook and ultimately a battle over the transfer of data between Europe and the US that led to the striking down of the Safe Harbour agreement between the two territories. Before taking up the Data Protection Commissioner’s role, Dixon was Irish Registrar of Companies, and previously with positions in the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in the areas of economic migration policy, and science, technology and innovation policy. But she also had an insight into how things work in multinationals, thanks to 11 years in two US multinationals based here. And she’s no stranger to taking on difficult tasks. She has a degree in Applied Languages, a Masters in European Economic and Public Affairs, a Masters in Governance, a Postgraduate Diploma in Computer Science, a professional Diploma in Official Statistics for Policy Evaluation and also successfully passed all eight subjects of the FE-1 Final Examination of the Law Society of Ireland in one year. It makes you tired just thinking about it. CO’B Cathy Kearney Apple VP European Operations Cathy Kearney isn’t one to hog the limelight. You rarely see her name in newspapers, and she isn’t a regular on the conference circuit. But she still ranks as one of the country’s most important business figures, heading up Apple’s operations in Cork. Kearney, a Cork-based accountant, has a number of job titles, including vice president of operations for Apple Distribution International, a role she took up in 2012, and director of operations at Beats Electronic Services, which came after the $3 billion acquisition of the firm in 2014. ADVERTISEMENT Not a lot was known about Apple’s operations in Cork until recent years, despite the fact the company has been in operation here since 1980. But all that has changed, first with Apple’s decision to lift a bit of the veil of secrecy surrounding the Irish operation, which employs around 5,000 people. Kearney has been thrust into the spotlight somewhat, thanks to the investigation into Apple’s European tax affairs. Not only has she appeared before a private session of US senate officials, she has also spoken to the European Parliament’s Special Committee on Tax Rulings. And she was widely reported as being the woman responsible for saving Apple billions of dollars – though it’s not known if she is happy with that assessment. She was also honoured by UCC in 2015, as part of the university’s Alumni Awards. CO’B Sonia Flynn Soundcloud VP Originally from Kildare, SoundCloud’s international vice president Sonia Flynn started out on a less traditional route into the tech industry. A degree in Applied Languages from the University of Coleraine was followed by a masters in German literature from Queen’s University Belfast. But an almost five-year stint in Google Ireland, ending with her final appointment as EMEA director of user operations led to a career with Facebook in 2009, with Flynn joining as director for community operations. In 2011, she took over as managing director of Facebook in Ireland, and steered the company through its years of growth here. But the lure of the more creative sector proved to have a lot more pull for Flynn. The chance to combine a passion for music and a love for technology led to the SoundCloud move in 2015, and a relocation to Berlin. The platform enables its users to upload, record, promote and share their originally-created content, and Flynn was tasked with growing it, much in the same way as she oversaw expansion in her previous roles. In between all that, Flynn has also found time for a business of her own – Roller, a blow dry bar located in Dublin’s Docklands area, in the heart of tech industry – still connected to the tech world but with its roots in the real one too. CO’B Sport Sene Naoupu Rugby player In a short space of time, Naoupu has become a key player for the Irish women’s rugby team, and also an integral part of the Sevens team, which at times for those players involved in both camps, leads to controversial decisions such as pulling Naoupu, along with two of her teammates, from this year’s Six Nations campaign to compete in the Sevens in Las Vegas instead. As a centre, her speed, vision, and excellent set of second-nature skills, make her a ferocious force on the pitch. Technically gifted, strong and fast, Naoupu won the Women’s Player of the Year trophy at 2016 at the Rugby Writers of Ireland Awards. New Zealand-born, with Samoan parents, Naoupu moved to Ireland with her husband George, who played for Connacht before moving to Harlequins. She has spoken about overcoming anorexia, and it is that mental strength that seems to typify both her personality, fitness training work, and of course her rugby. With the World Cup in Ireland this August, and plenty of eyes on the host team, Naoupu is set to shine. UM Sarah Keane President of the OCI After a chaotic 2016, the Olympic Council of Ireland (OCI) desperately needed a safe pair of hands. Enter Sarah Keane, the CEO of Swim Ireland, who beat acting president Willie O’Brien and CEO of Basketball Ireland Bernard O’Byrne to the post Pat Hickey had vacated. ADVERTISEMENT Keane became president of the OCI in February. Previously the CEO of Swim Ireland since 2004, she is now effectively the most powerful woman in Irish sport. A lawyer, water polo international, OCI and Federation of Irish Sport board member, Keane was also at the centre of managing the fallout from the Rio Olympics ticketing scandal, as one of three people on the OCI’s crisis management committee. Keane said she felt “humbled and privileged” upon her election, and it is certainly seen as a changing of the guard, as a woman who represented that change, conclusively winning 29 out of 43 votes. Keane will serve a four-year term, and with a damaged brand to repair in the public’s eyes, a fresh face with a legal background will go some way to refresh the organisation. UM Entertainment & Arts Ruth Negga Actor Irish actors have always excelled, but perhaps none in recent times with the grace and subtly of craft of Ethiopian-Irish Ruth Negga. Her remarkable performance in Loving earned her an Oscar nomination as well as seven award wins, and BAFTA Rising Star, Golden Globe, Critics’ Choice and other nominations. Negga’s rise has been gradual, yet every performance has been worthy of praise, from Misfits to Marvel’s Agents of SHIELD. Her Loving performance also landed her on the cover of US Vogue’s January issue this year, and endless plaudits from the fashion world for her unique style in a world of dressing-by-committee. She also currently stars in the AMC series Preacher with Dominic Cooper. “I became an actor to hide,” Negga told Donald Clarke in a recent interview in The Irish Times, “You oscillate between being really tough – warding off hurt – when you’re told you’re not good enough to having this really translucent skin, so you can absorb people and their vibrations. So you can do your job basically. It’s no wonder we’re all so peculiar.” Having now ‘arrived’, being set up for stardom after such a trajectory working in Ireland, Britain and the US, there is a calmness about Negga’s disposition in such a heady industry. “I don’t think I was prepared for how much I have to talk about myself,” she said in that interview. She will probably have to get used to that. UM Louise O’Neill Author Cork woman Louise O’Neill’s first two novels, Only Ever Yours, and especially Asking For It, remoulded the young adult literature landscape. She has won countless awards for her writing including Newcomer of the Year in 2014 at the Irish Book Awards and Book of the Year the following year. Asking For It was named a Printz Honor Book by the American Library Association. Outside of fiction, she is a passionate advocate for women’s rights and a mature conversation around sexual consent. Advice that sticks with O’Neill is, “What other people think of you is none of your business,” she says. “In a career like writing, you have to build up a residence, you can’t worry what people think, that paralysis you have when you’re trying to be honest in your writing.” O’Neill says she had to let go of other people’s perceptions of her, “and just really focus more on how I felt about myself and creating a career that felt meaningful and fulfilling for me, disregarding what looked impressive and cool from the outside”. O’Neill speaks about trying to shed that pressure of perception. “It’s just trying to let go of that need to be liked. Who cares? Who cares about strangers? All that matters is [that] your friends and family like you. Hopefully they do, I haven’t asked them recently!” ADVERTISEMENT For O’Neill, ambition is “one of the strongest driving forces” in her life. “When I was younger I felt ambition was a dirty word, particularly for women. When I moved to New York, I learned very quickly that by being self-deprecating ... they had no time or patience for that and they sort of discounted you. I needed to admit to myself that it was okay to be ambitious. That’s been very useful for my career. Self-promotion is an important part of being an author now, and I know that can be hard for Irish people, but I don’t have a problem with it.” As for future plans, “I just want to keep getting better, keep pushing myself as an artist. There was a Facebook memory today on my timeline from three years ago and it said, ‘Did I tell you all about how I’m going to be nominated for an Oscar? Probably best adapted screenplay, but I’m flexible. 2018 is my deadline.’ That might be pushing it.” Maybe not. The film and TV rights to Only Ever Yours were bought by Killer Content in the US, and the TV rights to Asking For It were acquired by Bandit in the UK. UM Annie Mac Radio and TV presenter and DJ BBC Radio star, Other Voices presenter, the front woman of several documentaries, tastemaker, DJ, and more, Annie Mac is one of the most significant people in British radio and dance music. Her name now a brand. Her Annie Mac Presents (AMP) brand, which has hosted live concerts, tours, and released compilation albums, has also developed an entire festival, called Lost & Found, in Malta. A regular across the British festival calendar, she draws big crowds at Glastonbury, and her laid back but remarkably astute selection choices endear her to a wide range of fans increasingly likely to hop from genre to genre in their fandom. Presenting on BBC Radio 1 five days a week, the BBC champion her as a successor to John Peel and Zane Lowe, given her ear for quality new music. Her latest documentary for BBC Three examined the closure of nightclubs across the UK, and she previously presented the Channel 4 series Superstar DJs. Her gradual yet lofty climb through the ranks has also been typified by hard work and a top attitude. Is there a more influential Irish person working in radio anywhere in the world right now? UM Sharon Horgan Writer, producer, actor, director Writer, producer, actor, director, the woman who Caitlin Moran calls “a f***ing goddess”, Sharon Horgan broke America with the Emmy-nominated Catastrophe and secured a second season of her HBO show Divorce. Last year’s pilot of Motherland, written with Graham and Helen Linehan and Holly Walsh, was brilliant. Before those, her collaboration with Dennis Kelly birthed Pulling, and with Holly Walsh she created Dead Boss, which she also co-wrote and starred in. But it was her teaming up with Rob Delaney for Catastrophe that brought her work to a wider audience around the world. It confirmed her status as one of the biggest talents in television and comedy in Britain, and crucially showed American audiences how to make TV about real life love. Her production company Merman is working on several film and television projects, and she recently took on an animation acting project, as the voice of Minerva Mertens in Cartoon Network’s Adventure Time. Acknowledged by her peers as a ferociously disciplined and dedicated worker, Horgan confesses to “an in-built awkwardness, plus a healthy kind of cynicism and, like, a bit of a sneery head on me. It’s easier to stand back and look at situations and have something funny to say about them. I don’t think I’ve ever found myself in any social engagement or situation where I’ve felt comfortable, or where I’ve felt ‘these are my people’ or ‘this is where I should be’. I’m always awkward”. UM ADVERTISEMENT Marian Keyes Author Fifteen novels, five non-fiction books, more than 33 million copies of her books sold, Keyes is undoubtedly one of the most successful Irish writers of all time. Her honesty and strength in dealing with depression and alcoholism has inspired as much as her books are loved, and her chatty but acutely smart writing style has launched a thousand copy cats. This hilarious and warm banter has migrated on to Twitter, providing insights into her love of Strictly Come Dancing and restoring furniture. Speaking at an Irish Times Women’s Podcast event recently, Keyes said, “I had no idea I was funny until I was in my 30s and I started going to AA meetings … I was telling people all these awful stories and they were roaring laughing. I realised I was hilarious and thought, ‘Jesus maybe I’ve a bit of a gift for this’.” Later this year, she will publish a new, much anticipated novel, The Break, about a husband who ups and leaves. Striving to be ‘the next Marian Keyes’ has become shorthand for massive global success and adoration from readers, yet somehow, despite her prominence on the literary landscape, she has remained as down-to-earth and familiar as the characters she so expertly draws. UM Stefanie Preissner Screenwriter, playwright and actor Overnight success stories in the Irish entertainment world are as rare as … well, RTÉ comedy series appreciated by millennials and their parents alike. But the whipsmart and hardworking Stefanie Preissner apparently managed to pull off both in 2016, with the runaway success of Can’t Cope, Won’t Cope, her six-part comedy-drama series about, as she said, “women who are difficult and make bad decisions and [ARE]vulnerable and endearing”. In fact, she wasn’t really an overnight success: the 28-year-old Munich-born, Mallow-raised writer and actor had been grafting steadily, often getting up at 4.30am to write, since she left the Gaiety School of Acting in 2012. Her earlier work includes a sell-out Irish run of her play Solpadeine Is My Boyfriend, which also went on national tour in Bucharest, Edinburgh and Australia, and eventually became a hugely popular podcast. Preissner’s great gift to young Irish women is to show them versions of themselves they can actually relate to, as opposed to what she has called “a real fetishised version of youth, a real glamorised version of going out for the night and having sex with people and then meeting up for brunch the next day and dissecting it over avocados”. It’s shaping up to be another busy year for her. Can’t Cope, Won’t Cope is back for a second series, and was recently acquired by BBC3. Her first book, Why Can’t Everything Just Stay the Same? (and other things I shout when I can’t cope), is out in the autumn. JO’C Design Yvonne Farrell and Shelley McNamara Architects Farrell and McNamara co-founded Grafton Architects in the late 1970s, and set about redefining what Irish architecture could be. The boldness and sophistication of their designs have won prestige, awe, and fans in equal measure. Imaginative, challenging, and very often simply outstanding, their architecture dots the Irish landscape, from the Solstice Arts Centre in Navan to the University of Limerick Medical School, but it is the scale and impact of their projects abroad that has brought Grafton Architects global acclaim. They won the World Building of the Year Award in 2008 for Universita Luigi Bocconi in Milan, and the RIBA International Prize in 2016 for the stunning UTEC University campus in Lima. Lord Richard Rogers, chairing the RIBA jury for the prize, described the building as “modern day Machu Picchu”. ADVERTISEMENT Farrell and McNamara are also both elected members of Aosdána. They are currently working on, among other things, a new School of Economics for University Toulouse 1 Capitole, the new Paul Marshall Institute for the London School of Economics, and the Parnell Square Cultural Quarter Project in Dublin. In 2018, Farrell and McNamara will curate the 16th Venice Architecture Biennale. UM Fashion & beauty Marissa Carter Entrepreneur and Cocoa Brown CEO Five years ago, Cocoa Brown Tanning was still just a big idea by its creator, then beauty salon owner Marissa Carter, who came up with it while on maternity leave. The first batch was bottled in November 2012 and today, four bottles of the product are sold every minute across the globe. “We have 10,000 stockists around the word, in Scandinavia, Australia, the UK and Ireland. The next step is opening a US office in New York. We have a distributor, and in June myself and my husband Ronan (who joined the company six months ago, as CFO) are moving to New York, with our two little ones and the dog,” she says. Carter says mentoring from other women has been a key factor in helping her to succeed. “A woman is much more likely to set up her own business if she has a mentor or a fellow female in business advocate. If you see someone else succeeding it makes you think, ‘that could be me, if she can do it, why can’t I?’,” she says. Carter, who is a graduate of Enterprise Ireland’s Going for Growth programme aimed at female entrepreneurs, now does a lot of formal and informal mentoring and speaking to other women. Her advice to other women is that you can never be over-prepared. “I’ve always loved learning, so I try to educate myself enough so that I can be the best I can. With knowledge comes confidence – the more of an authority I am on something, the more confident I feel, and the better I deliver.” Carter is aware that she has the opportunity to be a role model for her predominantly young client base, and it is not a responsibility she takes lightly. “So many of my customers are on social media, and they’re following my story, so I feel a responsibility to them. I’m aware that young girls are watching me, so I always try to give out the message that self-confidence is one of the most important factor for success. Growing up, I think my Mum really did always try and instil in me that I was capable, above all else.” The rest of her success, she admits, may be down to genes. “I was probably born cocky. To survive in business, you need thick skin and you need steel in your bones, and you need to be able to take rejection with a pinch of salt, because you’re always going to come across no more than yes.” JOC Ruth Curran Global Chair of IIC Partners Organiser of one of Ireland’s biggest annual charity fashion shows and passionate about Irish fashion and supporting young and up and coming designers, Ruth Curran has raised much needed funds for the National Maternity Hospital and last year’s star studded event at the Royal Hospital in Kilmainham was another sell out success, attracting ticket sales and sponsorship of over €50,000. Global Chair of IIC Partners, one of the largest executive search firms in the world, Curran travels widely internationally and was last year awarded Galway University’s Business and Commerce Alumni of the Year. She is also on the board of the university, chairs its academic planning and resource committee and is proud of the fact that NUIG is the only university that has consistently risen in the highly competitive World University Rankings. ADVERTISEMENT An accountant from a distinguished academic family in Galway, she has a Masters in Business from the UCD Michael Smurfit Graduate Business School and a Bachelor of Commerce degree from NUIG. Before she joined MERC, the Irish arm of IIC in 1999, she worked for Consolidated Press Holdings, one of Asia Pacific’s largest media organisations. Her job entails finding exceptional talent all over the world and she credits the team around her for MERC’s success. When interviewing prospective candidates, what does she look for? “First impressions count,” she says, “but what is important is the energy level, how they communicate, whether they have a can do, will do attitude, so resilience is important and the ability to inspire others.” A busy mother of four children aged from 3-10, she is married to fellow Galwegian Darren Cunningham, founder of a biotech company pioneering new ways of treating cancer. DMcQ Media Anne-Marie Tomchak UK Editor, Mashable You might not have heard the name Anne-Marie Tomchak, but take note of it – she is one of the people shaping the international digital media landscape in her new role heading up Mashable’s operations in the UK. “When I was growing up, we didn’t even have a phone, so it’s quite funny that I’ve found myself in this position,” she says. Now 34, the Longford native got her start at RTÉ, where she worked on Morning Ireland, before joining the BBC. She worked her way up the ranks, creating and presenting BBC Trending, and ultimately finding herself at the forefront of its digital media offering. By 2016, she found herself looking a for a new challenge, that would allow her to take on a more strategic role in an organisation. The job at Mashable gave her that opportunity, and she is now at the helm of a digital operation that employs 20. Irish people “do very well in social media and digital media internationally”, she says. “I don’t know if it’s just that we’re such good storytellers, or that Ireland hasn’t traditionally had such a hierarchical culture, but we’re very good at putting others at ease.” Tomchak says she has been helped by both male and female mentors, but she believes women in particular can help to pave the way for one another. “Now I’m lucky enough to be in a position where I’m hiring and managing people, I’m very conscious that women sometimes face different challenges than male colleagues. Overall, I think it’s an amazing time to be a woman in the media. Sure the internet has brought some negatives, but the positives of the digital world far outweigh them.” As an identical twin, Tomchak has a broad notion of what constitutes success, and believes career advancement is not the only yardstick. “Everyone is on their own journey and the quickest route to dissatisfaction is comparing yourself to others in a negative way. My twin sister is a mother of three small children, so we’re leading very different lives, and that gives me an interesting perspective. JO’C Dee Forbes Director General, RTÉ If there was some surprise surrounding Dee Forbes’s appointment to the top job at RTÉ last summer, it wasn’t about whether the former head of Discovery Networks in Northern Europe was up to the task. After all, her previous role involved managing 27 TV brands in 18 markets, reaching more than 270 million households. Instead, it was because some found it hard to believe that an RTÉ outsider would want the role of director general in an era likely to prove the national broadcaster’s most challenging yet, as it struggles to figure out how to adapt and survive in the digital era. ADVERTISEMENT But Forbes is not only undaunted by the prospect of turning RTÉ around, she seems to positively relish it. “Change can be disconcerting, but ultimately I have always believed that change is good,” she wrote in an early email to staff. She has already said she believes the RTÉ five years from now will be a very different beast to the one we have today. Top of her agenda from a content perspective is the mix of programme genres on schedules, the marketing of channels and services, how it fulfils its public service remit, the need to reach younger viewers and to work with what she playfully calls RTÉ’s “frenemies”. However she chooses to navigate those issues over the next five years, it’s safe to say the only thing with a permanent place on the schedule at RTÉ is change. JO’C Maeve Higgins Comedian, broadcaster It was always unlikely that Higgins’ talent would be confined to a small island. Having excelled on Naked Camera and Maeve Higgins’ Fancy Vittles, a broader audience called. She moved to London, then to New York, where she teamed up with Jon Ronson for a monthly show in Brooklyn. An excellent radio documentary-maker, Higgins has brought this prowess to her latest venture, an insightful and funny podcast about immigration, Maeve In America, where she again excels at storytelling. She has written for the New York Times, Elle, had a much-loved column in The Irish Times, appeared on Inside Amy Schumer, co-hosts Neil deGrasse Tyson’s StarTalk, and has written two excellent memoirs; We Have A Good Time… Don’t We? and Off We Go. Her writing and columnising casts surreal nets on a tide of sometimes pleasantly meandering and sometimes biting one-liners, with a style lying somewhere between David Sedaris and Phoebe Robinson, but still very much all Higgins. Her creative voice is so her’s that it’s impossible not to hear it when you read her work, and in a live standup context, her disarming self-deprecating style has a habit of snapping into focus revealing a piercing intelligence underneath. UM Health and science Johanne Powell holding Siobhan Powell Johanne Powell Carer Influence isn’t only about career accolades or chunky pay packets. Johanne Powell’s contribution to Irish society was to force us to revisit how we think and talk about those who do the important, undervalued, and still predominantly female, work of caring. In an interview with Irish Times journalist Rosita Boland in November 2016, she spoke with searing, and often uncomfortable honesty, about the struggle she faces to care for her profoundly disabled 32-year-old daughter Siobhan. “I’m not doing this job by choice,” she said. “I’m doing this job because I have to do it, because there is no alternative. I don’t want to do it anymore. I’m bored. I’m bored out of my tree doing the same thing day in, day out, with no changes.” Siobhan had by then spent three years on a waiting list of 61 people for a residential care place in their native Co Wexford. Powell’s interview lifted the lid on the unrecognised acts of heroism and endurance being carried out on an hourly basis across the State, and resonated with many other carers who are also in crisis. She demanded that we stop seeing them as saints “who’ll get their reward in heaven” and start seeing them for what they really are: overworked and underpaid humans, who desperately deserve a break. JO’C Dr Nora Khaldi Founder and Chief Scientific Officer, Nuritas At a time when the paucity of women in science is a real and pressing issue for the industry, it is hard to think of a better role model for aspiring young female scientists – or women in general, or humans in general, for that matter – than Dr Nora Khaldi. ADVERTISEMENT Born in Algeria to an Irish mother and a French father, Khaldi is a mathematician with a PhD in molecular evolution and bioinformatics from Trinity College Dublin. Shewas the first scientist to show gene transfer between multi-cellular species. Impressive though that sounds, it’s not actually what she’s best known for. In 2014, she set up Nuritas to develop the future of food – healthy living through functional, scientifically proven, and readily available ingredients, including things as ordinary as milk. That is every bit as revolutionary as it sounds: the company is currently trying to help people at risk of developing Type 2 diabetes fight it through the use of peptides, or molecules, that can be added to food. “Food is not the problem; food is the solution. And we should look at food as the solution,” she says. Last year, Khaldi’s start-up won a €3 million research grant from the EU and raised €2 million in funding from major investors including Salesforce founder Marc Benioff; Ali Partovi, who was an early investor in both Dropbox and Facebook; Bono and The Edge. Oh, and Nuritas was named one of Europe’s top 10 most innovative start-up companies by the European Commission. So what did you get up to in 2016 again? JO’C Food Tara McCarthy Bord Bia CEO Unlike many high achieving business women who operate in male-dominated environments, Tara McCarthy, who is chief executive of Board Bia, leads an organisation where women are strongly represented in the higher echelons of the command chain and throughout the company. “Traditionally the food and farming sector has been male dominated; however within Bord Bia almost 65 per cent of staff are female,” she says. McCarthy joined Bord Bia’s graduate programme having completed her primary degree in commerce at UCG and a Masters at the Smurfit Business School. In her 20-year career at the Irish food board she worked in France and Germany for more than 10 years, and fulfilled a number of senior management roles, rising to director of the food and beverages division. In September 2015, she took up the position of chief executive of Board Iascaigh Mhara. But with the imminent retirement of former Bord Bia chef executive Aidan Cotter, just 18 months later she was back in Lr Mount Street, at the helm of an organisation facing challenging markets and global uncertainty. “Brexit is a major concern and has certainly changed the landscape and how we will operate hereon. It has also made the industry, and all of us working on its behalf, more focussed and determined than ever. “Under Food Wise 2025, the industry-led strategic plan, we have an ambitious export target of reaching €19 billion by 2025, compared to €11 billion last year. This, and delivering on Bord Bia’s strategic plan, is my priority right now and will continue to be for the years ahead,” she says. McCarthy has been a regular contributor to the Government’s Food Harvest 2020 and Food Wise 2025 reports and is involved in the Pathways for Growth programme. “I always did like a challenge,” she says.       Topics: Ali Partovi Anne Anderson Anne Jo C Anne Marie Tomchak Uk Annie Mac Annie Mac Presents Aosdana Barack Obama Bernard O Byrne Breege O Donoghue Caitlin Moran Ciara Donlon Cocoa Brown Dennis Kelly Enda Kenny Taoiseach Graham Linehan Helen Linehan Holly Walsh Joanne O Riordan Johanne Powell John O Regan John Peel Julie Sinnamon Louise O Neill Cork Mac Um Annie Marc Benioff Marian Keyes Marissa Carter Marissa Carter Joc Minerva Mertens Minnie Melange Miss Ireland Nora Khaldi Founder Nuritas Pat Hickey Penney Sonly Richard Rogers Rob Delaney Rosita Boland Ryan Dcu Sarah Keane Sharon Horgan Shelley Mcnamara Farrell Sinead Kane Stefanie Preissner Um Sarah Keane Um Sharon Horgan Um Sinead Burke Um Sinead Kane Willie O Brien Yvonne Farrell Zane Lowe Academy Female High Fliers Accelerator American Library Association Crafts Council of Ireland Dcu Ryan Academy Department Of Foreign Affairs Enterprise Ireland Eu European Commission European Union Fordham University IDA Ireland Medical School Olympic Council Of Ireland Paul Marshall Institute RTÉ SNAP School Of Acting School Of Economics Trinity College Dublin Un United Nations Universita Luigi Bocconi University College Cork University Toulouse 1 University of Limerick Utec University Wexford Bank of Ireland Cartier Dropbox Facebook Grafton HBO Junior Chamber International Khaldi Merman NHS Riba Salesforce Theya Theya Healthcare Vhi Writer Algeria An Uaimh Australia Bucureşti Clonmel County Longford Dublin(IE) Edinburgh Europe Finland France Glastonbury Ireland Japan Las Vegas Lima(PE) London(GB) Malta Milano Millstreet New York City Paris(FR) United Kingdom United States Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Beauty Serums: the fruit and veg of skincare Food & Drink Ticket to cook: Irish chefs head for NYC, London, the Maldives Motors Revealed: how newest cars fared in toughest winter test around Film ‘I’m trying to make these huge questions more tangible and more personal’ Sponsored First-time buyers put Bray, Finglas and Navan on the map Vhi SwiftCare Clinics: when it’s not an emergency but it feels like one Tallaght leads in neighbourhood ranking for first-time buyer sales Putting business owners in control – the Convertibill way ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Commenting on The Irish Times has changed.

By Roger Wohlner | March 4, 2017 Previously 21 Ways the Rich Waste Their Money 1/16 Show Thumbnails Krista Kennell / Shutterstock.com Warren Buffett — perhaps the greatest investor of his or any other generation — is known for buying stocks and holding them for long periods of time through his firm, Berkshire Hathaway. Yet, it was recently announced that he has sold nearly all of his shares of Walmart. And last year, he exited his investment in AT&T. It was also recently announced that Buffett increased his shares of Apple and invested heavily in several airline stocks, including a new investment in Southwest Airlines. Previously, he largely shunned the airline industry. Here's a look at some stocks where Buffett has increased his investment in recent years, as well as a recap of some of the larger Berkshire Hathaway holdings. Looking over the list might help you decide where to invest in stocks during 2017. 2/16 Show Thumbnails pio3 / Shutterstock.com 1. Apple Berkshire Hathaway added to its Apple stake significantly in 2016. In the fourth quarter alone, it nearly quadrupled its shares of Apple. Apple continues to grow, and its products remain popular. The stock price is near its all-time high, buoyed in part by the company buying back shares of the stock, and by a steady dividend. Many mutual funds hold Apple stock. The company is setting records for unit sales of the iPhone. Although Apple continues as a leader in the tech space, a caution surrounds the continued pace of price appreciation, with the stock up more than 18 percent so far in 2017. 3/16 Show Thumbnails Lerner Vadim / Shutterstock.com 2. Delta Air Lines In mid-February, Berkshire Hathaway reported that it had amassed more shares of Delta Air Lines as part of a move to increase holdings in the airline industry. Berkshire Hathaway's investment in Delta was worth about $3 billion at the end of 2016. Delta had reported average annual earnings growth of more than 21 percent for the previous five years and a dividend yield of 1.47 percent, according to Morningstar. 4/16 Show Thumbnails Philip Pilosian / Shutterstock.com 3. United Continental Holdings Berkshire Hathaway reported holdings of about $2.1 billion of United Continental stock at the end of 2016. One of Buffett's best performing stocks of 2016, United Continental had reported average annual earnings growth of 13 percent for the previous five years. Over the past 12 months, the stock has traded in the range of $37.41 to $76.80 per share, with a recent close of $75.41. 5/16 Show Thumbnails Philip Pilosian / Shutterstock.com 4. American Airlines Berkshire Hathaway reported holdings of about $2.1 billion of American Airlines stock at the end of 2016. Like other carriers, American Airlines is constantly trying to innovate to gain an edge in a competitive industry. Recently, it unveiled Basic Economy fares in a handful of markets. 6/16 Show Thumbnails Chris Parypa Photography / Shutterstock.com 5. Southwest Airlines As part of an increase in airline holdings, Berkshire Hathaway reported a fourth-quarter 2016 purchase of $2 billion of stock in Southwest, a new position for Buffett. The stock posted a total return of 42.44 percent over the 12 months ending Feb. 24. That beat the Standard & Poor's 500 index (25.36 percent) and the average stock in Morningstar's airline group (24.53 percent). 7/16 Show Thumbnails Peter Braakmann / Shutterstock.com 6. Monsanto Berkshire Hathaway reported the purchase of about 8 million shares — worth more than $800 million — of Monsanto, a sustainable agriculture company. The stock posted a total return of 29.98 percent over the 12 months ending Feb. 24, beating the S&P 500 index (25.36 percent). 8/16 Show Thumbnails zhu difeng / Shutterstock.com 7. Sirius XM Berkshire Hathaway reported a $790 million purchase of shares of Sirius XM, a new position for Buffett in 2016. The stock posted a total return of 42.78 percent over the 12 months ending Feb. 24, beating the S&P 500 index (25.36 percent) but slightly below the average stock in Morningstar's broadcasting-radio group (41.34 percent). The company has a history of exceeding its earnings guidance. 9/16 Show Thumbnails JuliusKielaitis / Shutterstock.com 8. International Business Machines IBM is one of the largest investments in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio, worth almost $15 billion as of the end of 2016. The stock posted a total return of 40.78 percent over the 12 months ending Feb. 24, beating the S&P 500 index (25.36 percent) and above the average stock in Morningstar's information technology services group (27.58 percent). In fact, IBM might be a great stock for you to consider purchasing — especially if you're new to investing. 10/16 Show Thumbnails Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com 9. Phillips 66 Berkshire's stake in Phillips 66 was about $6.3 billion as of the end of 2016. The stock posted a total return of 1.85 percent over the 12 months ending Feb. 24, trailing the S&P 500 index (25.36 percent) and below the average stock in Morningstar's information oil and gas refining and marketing group (14.38 percent). Before you invest in Phillips 66, make sure you learn how to invest in oil stocks. 11/16 Show Thumbnails Sibuet Benjamin / Shutterstock.com 10. Kraft Heinz Kraft Heinz is Berkshire Hathaway's largest holding, worth nearly $30 billion as of the end of 2016. The stock posted a total return of 30.74 percent over the 12 months ending Feb. 24, trailing the S&P 500 index (25.36 percent) and above the average stock in Morningstar's information packaged goods group (16.76 percent). 12/16 Show Thumbnails Atstock Productions / Shutterstock.com 11. MasterCard Berkshire Hathaway's stake in MasterCard was more than $545 million at the end of 2016. The stock posted a total return of 29.36 percent over the 12 months ending Feb. 24, beating the S&P 500 index (25.36 percent) but trailing the average stock in Morningstar's credit services group (30.33 percent). Morningstar analysts feel the company has solidified its competitive position. They cite the company's network of global banks, merchants and cardholders as huge advantages. 13/16 Show Thumbnails Faiz Zaki / Shutterstock.com 12. Coca-Cola Berkshire Hathaway's stake in Coca-Cola was more than $16.7 billion at the end of 2016. The stock posted a total loss of 1.66 percent over the 12 months ending Feb. 24, trailing the S&P 500 index (25.36 percent) and the average stock in Morningstar's beverages-soft drinks group (3.22 percent). Morningstar analysts are optimistic about the company, citing its position as the leader in its segment as a factor in its ability to maintain a premium price. Morningstar also likes the opportunities for growth in emerging-market countries. 14/16 Show Thumbnails Peppinuzzo / Shutterstock.com 13. Wells Fargo Wells Fargo is a longtime Berkshire Hathaway holding that Buffett added to in 2015. Even in the wake of the fake account opening scandal last year, he has not liquidated any shares. Even with the scandal and its fallout, the stock's total return over the 12 months ending Feb. 24 was 24.62 percent, only slightly below that of the S&P 500 index at 25.36 percent. The total return was about half that of the average stock in Morningstar's bank group, however. According to the latest Morningstar analysis, "Wells Fargo's January business update confirmed our thesis that the impact of widespread sales fraud will be relatively short lived. Consumer checking account openings exceeded closings, deposit balances grew at a healthy rate during the ear, and reported customer satisfaction metrics are closing in on pre-scandal levels." 15/16 Show Thumbnails Andrey Arkusha / Shutterstock.com 14. Bank of New York Mellon Berkshire Hathaway's position in Bank of New York Mellon was worth just over $1 billion at the end of 2016. The stock posted a total return of 37.56 percent over the 12 months ending Feb. 24, beating the S&P 500 index (25.36 percent) and the average stock in Morningstar's asset management group (34.25 percent). Morningstar cites the "stickiness" of the firm's asset custody business and the leverage inherent in the firm's operations as reasons for optimism about the stock in the coming months. 16/16 Show Thumbnails iStock.com / Linda Parton 15. General Motors Berkshire Hathaway's stake in General Motors was worth around $1.8 billion at the end of 2016. The stock posted a total return of 33.22 percent over the 12 months ending Feb. 24, beating the S&P 500 index (25.36 percent) and the average stock in Morningstar's auto manufacturers group (20.96 percent). Morningstar analysts feel General Motors has tremendous earnings potential now that it can focus its U.S. marketing efforts on just four car brands instead of eight.

Assembly Elections 2017: Is Modi on a road to nowhere in Uttar Pradesh? NEW DELHI: Apple recorded the fastest growth in the Indian tablet market in the quarter ended December 2016 and made it into the top five, even as the segment shrank 3.1% to 3.7 million units for the year. The declining trend, which has been consistent over the past few years, is expected to continue, analysts at two research firms said. Apple’s shipments in the December quarter grew 16% from the preceding one and 17% from the year earlier, said analysts at International Data Corporation (IDC) India, adding that the Cupertino-based company had moved up the rankings after a long time. “While iPad Air 2 remained the topselling model for Apple, constituting half its total shipments, the iPad Pro accounted for 22.7% of India’s total detachable category in 2016,” IDC said Thursday. Detachables, which come with keyboards that can removed, are a subset of the tablet market. For the quarter and year ended December, the top four tablet makers by volume were Datawind, Samsung, Lenovo and iBall, in that order. Micromax was fifth for the full year and Apple took the slot in the fourth quarter. Cybermedia Research (CMR) reported a sharper 18% on-year fall in tablet shipments in 2016, to 3.5 million units, with Datawind leading the market, followed by Samsung, Pantel and Micromax. IDC analysts said consumer demand for tablets will decline in the coming years thanks to smartphones with large screens, reflecting a global trend as buyers hold on to their old devices instead of buying new ones. Commercial shipments may partially offset this with adoption having increased recently. The segment grew 35% in the full year. “We expect this to grow further in coming quarters,” said IDC India senior analyst Karthik J. “Detachables are expected to continue with healthy double-digit growth in 2016.” CMR expects data bundling and a strategic focus on industries such as healthcare or cab aggregators to provide some growth. But consolidation is set to hit this segment as well, the firm said, predicting that only six to seven players may remain, having dropped to 22 from 66 in 2015. Fourth-quarter tablet shipments fell 19.6% from the preceding one and 4.3% from the year earlier to 820,000 units. “This is primarily due to seasonal decline after festive spike in Q3 and demonetization limiting the consumer sales in the last quarter of the year,” IDC said. IDC said the detachables category grew 30.7% in 2016, driven by demand from both the consumer and commercial segments. Acer accounted for almost a fourth of them, followed by Apple’s iPad Pro. 4G tablets accounted for almost 25% of total tablet shipments in 2016, up from 6% in the previous year, both research agencies said.

Launched in 2008, Spotify had 40 million paid subscribers in September and the company tweeted the 50 million figure on Thursday, the same day messaging app company Snap Inc pulled off its massive share sale that bodes well for other technology companies considering a flotation. Apple, which launched its music service less than two years ago, had about 20 million subscribers in December and its entry looks to have done little to slow the rapid growth of its older Swedish-based rival. Spotify, which has yet to show a profit as it spends to grow internationally, is now looking at a possible stock market listing in the United States, online news portal TechCrunch said last month. A company spokeswoman declined to comment on Friday on when it might seek a listing. But a partner at a leading investor in Spotify, venture capital firm Northzone, said late last year the company could start to become profitable as early as 2017 after years of focusing squarely on “growth, growth, growth”. Spotify is the most highly valued venture backed start-up in Europe and according to media reports is considering a listing on Nasdaq and potentially a dual listing on the Nasdaq exchange in Stockholm, where the company is headquartered. It was last valued at $8.53 billion, according to venture capital market research firm CB Insights. That valuation alone would make a flotation Europe’s biggest technology start-up listing since the market launch of German e-commerce investor Rocket Internet in 2014. While still loss-making, Spotify has posted rapid subscriber growth since it was created a decade ago by Swedish founders Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzon. Following its announcement on Thursday that it had reached 50 million paid subscribers, Ek made a point of retweeting a comment from Wall Street media analyst Rick Greenfield which pointed to how Spotify was adding subscribers at an increasingly rapid rate. The Stockholm-based company also announced a major expansion in New York last month. One of Europe’s most highly valued venture-backed start-ups, Spotify will move its New York office to the World Trade Center from the Midtown area of Manhattan, adding more than 1,000 new jobs. In 2016 Americans used on-demand streaming platforms, such as Spotify, to listen to 431 billion music tracks, Nielsen said in its U.S. year-end report.

Apple Launches a Gold 32GB iPhone 6 Variant for Asian Markets GO It’s a limited-edition model offered by Taiwan Mobile Mar 4, 2017 08:35 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Apple has quietly introduced a variant of its iPhone 6 model, one that offers 32GB of internal memory and comes in a Gold color. Apple launched the iPhone 6 back in 2014 in three storage variants 6GB, 64GB, and 128GB. The new iPhone 6 with 32GB is offered by Taiwan Mobile for a 30-month contract for about $45 per month. The model has already been made available in China, sold by third-party retailers, and it will arrive at Taiwan Mobile on March 10. Taiwan Mobile says that the model is a limited edition, which means that only a few units will be offered, until the stock runs out. The model is also available from Apple’s website. 4.7-inch display and 1GB of RAM iPhone 6 comes with a 4.7-inch display with 750 x 1334 pixel resolution. It has 1GB of RAM and draws power from a 1,810mAh battery. The smartphone features a dual-core Apple A8 chipset, clocked at 1.4GHz and PowerVR GX6450 graphics processing unit. iPhone 6 with 32GB of storage in gold The phone’s rear camera capacity reaches 8MP with f/2.2 aperture and dual-LED flash, while its front camera is 1.2MP with the same aperture and FaceTime over Wi-Fi or cellular feature. The iPhone 6 is currently offered in Space Gray, Silver and Gold colors. Apple is also rumored to announce a new iPhone SE with 128GB of storage this month, during the unveiling of new iPad Pro devices. iPhone SE currently sells in variants with 16GB and 64GB of memory, while a model with more onboard memory would certainly appeal to customers who are fans of iPhones with smaller screens. A 32GB iPhone SE variant would also be released, but that remains to be seen. Analysts have said that Apple won’t announce a refresh of the iPhone SE this year, as the company is focusing on the iPhone 8 to mark the ten-year anniversary since the first iPhone was launched.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (2 Images) #Apple#iPhone 6#iPhone SE#iPhone 8#iPad Pro subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Apple iPhone 6 (2 Images) 01 02 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Apple iPhone 8 to Feature a Redesigned Fingerprint Sensor Apple's 2017 iPhones to Feature Lightning Ports, Not USB Type-C Apple Might Announce New iPhone SE with 128GB This Month Apple Files Patent for Scroll-like iPhone with Retractable Display Third-Party Windows Updates Kind of Risky, Security Expert Says Google May Ditch 3.5mm Headphone Jacks on Next Pixel Phones AMD Rolls Out Its New Crimson ReLive Graphics Driver - Get Version 17.3.1 Google Play Celebrates Five Years, Here Are the Most Downloaded Games and Apps Samsung Confirms Delay of Android Nougat Update to Galaxy S6 and S6 edge Third-Party Windows Updates Kind of Risky, Security Expert Says Google May Ditch 3.5mm Headphone Jacks on Next Pixel Phones AMD Rolls Out Its New Crimson ReLive Graphics Driver - Get Version 17.3.1 2 photos    Apple iPhone 6 new ios apps NeuroNation: Train your brain to improve your memory and focus with NeuroNation Flipagram: Create cool videos by mixing up your photos with music Timer+: Set up dozens of timers and control them all with ease Nutshell Camera: Create some pretty cool videos with Nutshell Camera IKEA Catalogue: Check out the IKEA Catalogue for more than just furniture Complete: Complete puts a social twist to your regular to-do list/ task manager WebMD Baby: WebMD Baby offers help in how to best tend to your baby Reader comments New Noncombustible Battery with Three Times More Power Is Under Development more on: Battery i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

The videos follow the same format as the ones launched a few weeks ago. Each video starts of as a Tweet that highlights some issues non-iPad Pro users deal with regularly. The first video shows a female student having a problem in keeping her math notes tidy since she always falls asleep during the lecture. It then proceeds to showcase the iPad Pro’s note taking capabilities through the Apple Pencil. It even highlights the device’s capability of recording full lectures. Meanwhile, the second video shows a woman complaining about having so many things on her desk. It then rolls to suggest the iPad Pro as a replacement for a desktop and other usual accessories such as a scanner and a piece of paper. Just as it has done in the previous series of videos, the tweets featured are real and come from actual people. Apple has used these common problem as a way to address the issues people have with their devices. So far, the other videos feature the iPad Pro’s speed, Microsoft Word app, LTE connectivity, the Apple Pencil, and many more. The videos come as part of Apple’s promotion for the rumored release of the new iPad Pro. According to rumors, Apple will be refreshing the device with a 10.5-inch flagship model and three other tablets with a 9.7-inch, 12.9-inch, and a 7.9-inch display. The device is believed to launch this month.

Friday’s complaint concerns three apartment buildings – located at 201 5th Ave. N., 621 5th Ave. S., and 401 Pine Street in Edmonds – that are managed by defendant Debbie A. Appleby, of Stanwood, Wash. The properties are owned by three Limited Liability Corporations controlled by Appleby – Apple One, LLC, Apple Two, LLC, and Apple Three, LLC—which are also named as defendants in the suit. The complaint alleges that in March 2014, defendant Appleby told a woman seeking an apartment for herself, her husband and their 1-year-old child that the apartment buildings were “adult only” and therefore not available to her family. The complaint also alleges that at various other times from April 2014 to November 2015, defendants advertised their available apartments as being restricted to adults only. The family filed a complaint with the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which conducted an investigation, issued a charge of discrimination against the defendants, and referred the case to the Department of Justice. “Equal access to housing is essential for all Americans, including families with young children,” said U.S. Attorney Annette L. Hayes. “Particularly in our tight housing market, landlords must follow the law and make units available without discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability or familial status.” “The Fair Housing Act prohibits landlords from denying apartments to families just because they have children,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Tom Wheeler of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. “Many families already face challenges finding affordable housing, and they should not also have to deal with unlawful discrimination.” The complaint seeks a court order requiring defendants to cease their discriminatory housing practices, damages for the family that filed the HUD complaint and any other families against whom the defendants discriminated against because they had children, plus civil penalties. Any individuals who have information relevant to this case are encouraged to contact the Civil Rights Division at 1-800-896-7743, Option 96.The case is being jointly handled by trial attorney Kathryn Legomsky for the Civil Rights Division for the U.S. Department of Justice and Assistant United States Attorney J. Michael Diaz for the Western District of Washington. You can read the full Justice Department complaint here.

We couldn’t figure it out because she was one of the first people to view and she and her husband had great jobs. Now she knows. Reply Laura Johnson March 4, 2017 at 2:14 pm Joy- That is disappointing, but Edmonds is not immune and discrimination eventually touches all of us. We need to take a stand against discrimination and profiling- in their many unjust forms. Reply Alec denson March 4, 2017 at 9:30 pm “not immune to discrimination” – pretty euphemistic way of putting it. Edmonds is one of the whitest places in western Washington. Reply Laura Johnson March 5, 2017 at 5:53 am Exactly! Point taken on word check- thank you. LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply Please enter your comment!

But those concerns were quickly erased when I discovered MacSuperstore, an authorized Apple reseller that had been in business since the 90’s. The store offered everything that a corporate Apple Store had to offer, and more, as it wasn’t constrained by the limitations Apple puts on its own stores. MacSuperstore could deal in used products, as well as items from third-party vendors that Apple would never stock in its own stores. Being the only authorized Apple reseller in the area, MacSuperstore saw steady success. And apparently, the independent store’s good fortunes put MacSuperstore’s locale on Apple’s radar. In 2007, Apple opened the Higuera Street Apple Store in downtown San Luis Obispo. I wrote a (now long-gone) blog post at the time criticizing this decision, as it felt like Apple was moving in on MacSuperstore’s turf and pushing out an established business that you’d think Apple would see as a valued partner instead of a competitor. The years carried on and MacSuperstore seemed to weather the Apple Store’s encroachment. MacSuperstore even moved into a bigger, fancier location, right next to the new Target store on the west side of town. But the local market is apparently not big enough for two Apple dealers. Last December, seemingly out of nowhere, MacSuperstore sent this e-mail to customers: Dear Customers & Friends, It was August 1998….. the iMac was a week old and MacSuperstore came to life. A little store with big dreams (who else would put “superstore” on a 1,200 sq/ft store)? Over the years, we’ve dedicated ourselves to providing the best possible customer care along side the world’s best tech products; unfortunately, the industry and the way folks shop has changed a lot, and our efforts to represent Apple have come at a cost. These days, with box stores and online sources heavily discounting the same products, Apple needs the “little guys” less and less. After much consideration, we have decided to close our doors. In the end, no matter how happy our customers are or great the store looks, a business has to be profitable to survive. We appreciate the dedication of our customers in giving us a chance to serve you. Seeing the positive impact of technology in the lives of our customers, has been what kept us going these 18 years. It has been a good run, but a necessary ending. Thanks for everything… Shane (The e-mail was signed by Shane Williams, founder of MacSuperstore.) I was shocked to get that e-mail, as I thought the store was doing fine. I was also concerned about some trade-in credit I had remaining with the store. But MacSuperstore stayed a class act ’til the end, giving me cash on the spot for the trade-in credit, no questions asked. It’s impossible to say just how much Apple’s influence in the local market affected MacSuperstore’s bottom line. Brick-and-mortar shops are being assaulted from all directions these days, and it’s likely MacSuperstore lost some customers to online sellers. Still, during a conversation I had with a knowledgable MacSuperstore employee on one of the store’s final days, he said that Apple has pretty much stopped licensing independent stores as authorized resellers. He also said that, due to Apple’s own requirements, MacSuperstore couldn’t sell their Apple license to a new buyer. MacSuperstore had bought out several other Apple retailers in nearby markets over the years. All of those stores have since closed, along with the San Luis Obispo shop. I’ll definitely miss having this unique store in my hometown. Of course, the Higuuera Street Apple Store is likely to be there for years to come. But, that corporate store will never have the heart and soul of that independent reseller on the other side of town. RIP, MacSuperstore.

Camera is one of the important factors of a smartphone as it is essential for capturing those memorable moments, and a lot of us today are dependent on our mobile phones for the same. Once, people used to purchase digital camerad to capture different momories and it was a must carry device when going out for a vacation. But, things have changed now. Smartphones with good camera performance  have taken their place.   Listed here are 5 smartphones that will never let you down when it comes to capturing pictures offering quality imaging. Our list also includes the smartphones which come with dual rear camera setup. These devices feature a combination of either two differnt or same megapixel dual camera sensors. The secondary camera at the back of the device is to provide enhanced depth of field (DOF) or BOKEH effect. DOF, also called focus range or effective focus range is the distance between the nearest and farthest objects in a scene that appears acceptably sharp in an image. Read on to find out more. Apple iPhone 7 Plus The Apple iphone 7 Plus was launched in India last year in October in 32 GB, 128 GB and 256 GB storage models. Apple iPhone 7 Plus comes with a 5.5 inch LED backlit IPS display with 1920x1080 pixel resolution having 625 cd/M2 max brightness. It comes with dual camera set up having a primary 12 megapixel camera and a secondary 12 megapixel camera as well. The secondary camera in the iPhone 7 Plus is meant to create depth effect in images and helps users to get 2x zoom without any assistance from software. Post 2x, the camera takes help of software as is usually happens in smartphones.   The primary 12 megapixel camera in iPhone 7 Plus has f/1.8 aperture, Optical Image Stabilisation, six element lens, Live Photo feature with stabilization, Sapphire crystal lens cover, Backside illumination sensor, Hybrid IR filter, Auto HDR, Burst mode, timer mode, panorama and geo tagging features. There is Quad LED True tone flash light in the back panel of the phone. The 12 megapixel camera can record 4K videos, slow motion full HD videos at 120 fps and HD videos at 240 fps. The iPhone 7 Plus has 7 megapixel front camera with f/2.2 aperture. Called as FaceTime HD camera, these can record full HD videos, and have BSI sensor, Auto HDR, Auto Image Stabilisation, Burst mode and Timer mode. Apple introduced its new CPU – A10Fusion, which it said is the best ever CPU to feature in a smartphone. Built on the 64-bit architecture, the CPU comes with four cores – two for conserving battery power and two for high performance. They have a separate motion coprocessor while Apple says that their graphics processor is 50 per cent faster than that of previous A9 SoC. The LTE enabled iPhone 7 Plus has WiFi (ac), WiFi with MIMO, Bluetooth 4.2, GPS with GLONASS and NFC. It has fingerprint sensor that is integrated into the home button. The built in Li-Ion battery claims to offer talktime of upto 21 hours on 3G network. Besides, the smartphone come with nano SIM slot, Three-axis gyro, Accelerometer, Proximity sensor, Ambient light sensor and Barometer sensors. Honor 6X Earlier, this year Huawei launched the Honor 6X smartphone with dual-camera set up for Rs 12,999 for the 3GB RAM variant and Rs 15,999 for 4GB RAM variant. The device comes in two variants, a 3GB RAM + 32GB internal storage and a 4GB RAM + 64GB variants and is available exclusively via Amazon India. The main highlight of the device is the dual-camera setup at the back. Honor 6X comes with a dual-camera set up at the back with one sensor being a 12-megapixel sensor and other being a 2-megapixel sensor. The set up comes with phase detection autofocus (PDAF), LED flash etc. At the front, there is an 8-megapxel sensor for selfies. The set up lets you dig into and play with shallow depth of field and one can change the focus of an image post clicking it. The secondary camera at the back of the device is to provide enhanced depth of field or bokeh effect. However, you have to be very careful at times to get that perfect shot. If done right, the shot comes out to be really natural and the software also allows you to select the focal point after you have clicked the image. The camera is though impressive in low-light, but the camera manages to dig out pretty good selfies in daylight. See Huawei Honor 6X Camera Samples As far as other specifications are concerned, Honor 6X runs on Android 6.0 Marshmallow with EMUI v4.1 on top. Other than that, it comes with a 5.5-inch (1080x1920 pixels) full-HD IPS display with 2.5D curved glass protection. On the inside, the device is powered by a Kirin 655 octa-core (4 cores at 2.1GHz + 4 cores at 1.7GHz) chipset with Mali-T830MP2 GPU paired with 3GB RAM + 32GB internal storage or 4GB RAM + 64GB internal storage. In both the cases, the internal storage is expandable via microSD card. There is 3340 mAh battery inside and the smartphone also offers 4G with VoLTE, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS with A-GPS, Compass etc. You can read its review here: Huawei Honor 6X Review: More than just a swagphone 1 2 >> Top 5 Camera Smartphones Best 5 Camera Smartphones iphone 7 plus honor 6x Huawei P9 Google Pixel LG V20 Camera Smartphones First Published : Saturday, March 04, 2017 - 11:22 Similar News Epson L655 printer Review: An all in one printer that will not disappoint!

By Mikah Sargent Friday, Mar 3, 2017 at 8:30 am EST 0 Comments Apple's new HomeKit mini site is the perfect place to learn about new HomeKit-enabled accessories. I've been waiting for Apple create its latest mini site since I first heard the word "HomeKit" way back in 2014. The site, lovingly nestled within the iOS section of Apple's site features a fun film that shows off some of the cool stuff you can do with HomeKit-enabled accessories, Siri, and the iOS Home app. Personally, I think the gal in the video has way too many HomeKit scenes, but that's neither here nor there. If you're curious, you can check out the page at the following link. If you wanna know what you're getting yourself into first, read on! Apple's HomeKit mini site So what's this mini site all about? It's all about HomeKit, the Home app, and HomeKit-enabled accessories. This site is dedicated to not only explaining what the heck that little orange, house-shaped tile on your iPhone is for, it's dedicated to explaining the benefits and possibilities of home automation with HomeKit and the Home app. You can get a brief overview of the Home app, learn about HomeKit scenes, Siri voice control, HomeKit automations, HomeKit-enabled accessories, and home hubs. Can't I get that right here on iMore? HOW FUNNY! I was hoping you were going to ask that! Yes, yes you can. HomeKit HomeKit FAQ HomeKit accessories HomeKit help HomeKit explainer HomeKit news HomeKit discussion I'm gonna let you in on a little secret, though: You should still check out Apple's site, 'cause it'll be one of the places I regularly check when I'm writing about HomeKit news. Does the site help me set up HomeKit accessories? Yup! It can be a little tricky setting up HomeKit-enabled accessories (mostly because they typically require third-party app set up before HomeKit set up), so Apple's linked to a support article with loads of information about setting up your various gadgets in the Home app. What else does the site feature? Uh, only a dream come true (for me, anyway)! There's now a page that shows all the HomeKit-enabled accessories approved by Apple. The page is beautifully designed and split into accessory type, so you can tap (or click) to jump to a specific section. The list has links to the various accessories (YESSSS!) and offers up information about their availability. The availability tags include Announced and Coming Soon. It's not entirely clear what they mean, but we can use context clues to decipher: Announced: Either the product has been announced for the first time or HomeKit compatibility has been announced. I get the impression this means it'll be awhile before we see the product available for purchase. Coming soon: I take it this is a step above "Announced". The product (or HomeKit compatibility) is right around the corner. I wish I knew the exact timeframe, 'cause there are a few accessories on the list I'm eyeballing. Anything else? Nope, that's pretty much it! But it's a whole heck of a lot, to be honest. Apple's list of HomeKit-enabled accessories used to be buried in its vast Apple Support database. The page was a long, bulleted list (without links!) of available HomeKit-enabled accessories — upcoming accessories weren't listed. It also wasn't updated as often as HomeKit-enabled gadgetry was hitting the market. This dedicated mini site coupled with Tim Cook describing his personal HomeKit setup in the last Apple earnings call gives me hope and loads of excitement for the future of HomeKit and Apple's Home app. I love having a connected home and it's clear Apple is committed to making the smart home all the more awesome.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Google’s Pixel didn’t just copy the iPhone 6 design, it copied a crazy iPhone 4 ‘feature’ as well Zach Epstein BGR NewsMarch 2, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share It’s pretty strange how defensive Android fans get when you make an observation that is beyond obvious to anyone with two eyes. Actually, it’s pretty obvious to anyone with one eye, too. The Google Pixel copied Apple’s iPhone 6 design. You should’ve seen the emails and tweets we got after running this post. Seriously, is it even really such a big deal? HTC cloned Apple’s iPhone 6, and that phone ended up selling quite well for the struggling smartphone maker. What’s funny is that Apple’s iPhone 6 is styled in a way that looks very similar to HTC’s old HTC One line, though Apple used a much different shape on its devices. Meanwhile, HTC’s A-series phones are a spitting image of the iPhone, and the Pixel is pretty much an iPhone 6 with a piece of glass slapped on the back. Now, in a funny and peculiar turn of event, it looks like Google dug much deeper into Apple’s pocket than we thought. Not only did the company ape Apple’s iPhone 6 design, it also borrowed an old iPhone “feature” that dates all the way back to 2010. Don't Miss: 10 reasons why not even the best Android phones can get iPhone users to switch Once upon a time, there was a slick new iPhone. It was the first iPhone Apple released with an all glass and metal build, and Apple achieved the feat by utilizing a novel antenna design that placed the antennas on the outside of the phone. It was a brilliant move in theory. In practice, there was one teeny tiny problem: it made the iPhone 4 unusable as a phone for many people. Why? Because holding it with your hand covering a certain part of the antennas would cause signal to drop off. Then-CEO Steve Jobs tried to play it cool at first — remember when he replied to someone complaining about the problem and told hit to “just avoid holding it that way”? — but Apple ended up having to hand out free bumper cases to all iPhone 4 owners so that they provided a barrier between the user’s hand and the antennas. Apple then fixed its design on future iPhones so that they were no longer affected. With all that in mind, enjoy this brief video of a “secret hidden feature” on the Google Pixel XL (via Reddit): Trending right now: One of Vizio’s best sound bars is on sale again on Amazon Exclusive: This is the Galaxy S8 10 reasons why not even the best Android phones can get iPhone users to switch See the original version of this article on BGR.com Reblog Share Tweet Share What to Read Next IBM to build quantum computers, selling machines millions of times faster than anything made before The Independent Amazing iPhone Accessories For Photography Lovers eBaySponsored Score an Apple Mac Mini desktop computer for just $400 on Best Buy Digital Trends New leaked photos give us a crystal clear look at the Galaxy S8 BGR News New report reaffirms the most exciting new iPhone 8 feature BGR News

The spot is a continuation of Apple’s iPad Pro commercials that directly respond to real tweets from real people. iPad Pro — Take better notes is a direct response to @jeszka24, who tweeted, “My math notes are a mess since I’m half asleep.” This spot, and the one below, work a bit better for me than the previous one, but it could be that I’m just in a good mood. Need Less Stuff The company released a second spot called iPad Pro — Need less stuff in response to @LixHewett. She tweeted, “There are way too many things on my desk.” In this commercial, Apple argues you can use iPad Pro to “replace a scanner, a pad of paper, and a laptop, so you can get rid of all that old stuff.” It then ends with a not-funny-attempt-at-being-weird-and-quirky where the actress playing the tweeter says she won’t get rid of her large ventriloquist dummy. Up until that point, I thought this spot’s message was clear and well-delivered. Your mileage may vary. Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Reddit More Email Print Tumblr Tags: Apple, Commercial, iPad Pro, Social Media, Twitter 7 Comments Add a comment Jamie March 4, 2017 That’s great for students, but I am a professional and virtually nothing the iPad does is a part of my workflow. Forcing it to be so actually decreases my efficiency. That’s a personal use-case scenario, sure, but nevertheless, it is. For what it’s worth: Google bribed their way into education, I witnessed some of these deals firsthand in California. Apple’s products are so much better, and greed, not functionality, is pushing them out in spite of that superiority. Seriously, in my own experience, a lot of kids preferred pen and paper to the Chromebooks that were foisted on them. Something is going to have to be done about corrupt school boards if Apple wants to gain any traction again. March 4, 2017 at 11:23 EST AM geoduck March 4, 2017 OK the last one was a bit weird, but I liked it anyway. Actually I’ve liked this series a lot. They are clever, and creative. March 4, 2017 at 11:52 EST AM paikinho March 4, 2017 I would have loved this in college. My efficiency would have gone up a tic. Jamie is right about the chrome books. My daughter has had one issue by the school, because everything is on the cloud as far as her assignments and such. Unfortunately she has to get at it with a slow, sluggish chromebook that is not very functional and wastes much of her time. When she gets home she is dying to jump on the MacBook Pro so she can sail through her work. It is just a vastly more efficient way of doing the same thing and that is without all the touch screen stuff. It would be interesting to get a keyboard setup for the iPad Pro we just got for the holidays and see if that would be better still or not. Fun experiment. March 4, 2017 at 12:26 EST PM geoduck March 4, 2017 The iPad Pro, especially the one coming out this year, will be powerful enough to do emulation. Imagine if Apple came out with a basic shell to let you run a limited selection of Apps, word processors, spreadsheets, the sort of thing that wouldn’t stumble from a slowdown, on the iPad Pro. Part of this Emulation App would allow support for a wireless mouse. Sure it wouldn’t rum massive games or Autocad. It would however take care of those bits that are needed to make the iPad Pro into a true laptop replacement for a LOT of people. March 4, 2017 at 8:13 EST PM geoduck March 4, 2017 “…limited selection of Mac Apps…” March 4, 2017 at 8:14 EST PM mactoid March 5, 2017 Can anyone tell what note taking app is being used?

Assembly Elections 2017: Is Modi on a road to nowhere in Uttar Pradesh? NEW DELHI: Apple recorded the fastest growth in the Indian tablet market in the quarter ended December 2016 and made it into the top five, even as the segment shrank 3.1% to 3.7 million units for the year. The declining trend, which has been consistent over the past few years, is expected to continue, analysts at two research firms said. Apple’s shipments in the December quarter grew 16% from the preceding one and 17% from the year earlier, said analysts at International Data Corporation (IDC) India, adding that the Cupertino-based company had moved up the rankings after a long time. “While iPad Air 2 remained the topselling model for Apple, constituting half its total shipments, the iPad Pro accounted for 22.7% of India’s total detachable category in 2016,” IDC said Thursday. Detachables, which come with keyboards that can removed, are a subset of the tablet market. For the quarter and year ended December, the top four tablet makers by volume were Datawind, Samsung, Lenovo and iBall, in that order. Micromax was fifth for the full year and Apple took the slot in the fourth quarter. Cybermedia Research (CMR) reported a sharper 18% on-year fall in tablet shipments in 2016, to 3.5 million units, with Datawind leading the market, followed by Samsung, Pantel and Micromax. IDC analysts said consumer demand for tablets will decline in the coming years thanks to smartphones with large screens, reflecting a global trend as buyers hold on to their old devices instead of buying new ones. Commercial shipments may partially offset this with adoption having increased recently. The segment grew 35% in the full year. “We expect this to grow further in coming quarters,” said IDC India senior analyst Karthik J. “Detachables are expected to continue with healthy double-digit growth in 2016.” CMR expects data bundling and a strategic focus on industries such as healthcare or cab aggregators to provide some growth. But consolidation is set to hit this segment as well, the firm said, predicting that only six to seven players may remain, having dropped to 22 from 66 in 2015. Fourth-quarter tablet shipments fell 19.6% from the preceding one and 4.3% from the year earlier to 820,000 units. “This is primarily due to seasonal decline after festive spike in Q3 and demonetization limiting the consumer sales in the last quarter of the year,” IDC said. IDC said the detachables category grew 30.7% in 2016, driven by demand from both the consumer and commercial segments. Acer accounted for almost a fourth of them, followed by Apple’s iPad Pro. 4G tablets accounted for almost 25% of total tablet shipments in 2016, up from 6% in the previous year, both research agencies said.

The iPhone 5 is getting older which puts a greater importance on each update Apple releases for the former flagship. Apple’s iOS updates for older devices can have a dramatic effect on a device’s performance. Sometimes the effect is positive. Sometimes its negative. Apple’s latest iOS 10 update for the iPhone 5 is a small but important update. The iPhone 5 iOS 10.2.1 update is much smaller than iOS 10.2 but it brings some notable changes to the device. If you’re making the move from the iOS 10.2 update, your iOS 10.2.1 update will be tiny, only a few megabytes. If you’re coming from something older than iOS 10.2 you can expect your update to be much larger thanks to the features and fixes from previous iPhone 5 iOS upgrades. They are baked into iOS 10.2.1. This roundup will take you through our impressions of the iPhone 5 iOS 10.2.1 update’s performance and it will guide you through some of the key things to keep in mind as we push toward Apple’s next iOS 10 release. We’ll continue to update this roundup with new details as we get them so keep an eye out for frequent changes. iPhone 5 iOS 10.2.1 Review: One Week Later   1 / 9 The iPhone 5 iOS 10.2.1 update is tiny and it'll only take you a few minutes to download and install. It took us about three minutes to download the update over a fast Wi-Fi speed network and about five minutes to finish up the installation.  We recommend setting aside 10-15 quiet minutes where you can monitor both the download and installation without distractions.  We've been using the iPhone 5 iOS 10.2.1 update for a week now and the update is still holding up nicely on our AT&T model.  The iPhone 5's battery continues to work miracles. We haven't noticed any abnormal battery drain during our time with iOS 10.2.1 though that could certainly change down the road. We've tested the iPhone 5 and its new update with several different ISPs, routers and Bluetooth devices. We haven't noticed any major issues during our week with the upgrade. AT&T's LTE and 4G networks are working fine as well.  Random reboots were an issue for us on iOS 10.2 though we haven't noticed any during our time on iOS 10.2.1. That's a big improvement, at least for us. UI speed is decent. Most animations and transitions are fast and fluid and we haven't experienced any lag when opening up Control Center.  The user interface still lags when opening up folders and some apps but that's par for the course. Remember, this phone is over four years old.  If you're already on iOS 10.2, iOS 10.2.1's fixes and security patches definitely make it worth a look. Performance is also a plus at the week milestone.  If you're on something older than the iOS 10.2 update, make sure you dig into more feedback before you make the jump to iOS 10.2.1.  For more on the merits of iOS 10.2.1, see our list of reasons to and not to install the iOS 10.2.1 update on your iPhone.   1 / 9 4 Responses 12/19/2016 Facebook lite apk Reply i like ios 10.2 more than 10.1. power berry slow lost 02/24/2017 Kent Reply After installing 10.2.1 on my iPhone 5s I started getting random reboots. At least 10 per day. If plugged into the charger, the reboots seemed to go away. 02/27/2017 Jarvis Reply Hi guys, I am using iPhone 5s with ios 9.3.3. I am getting reminders to update to whitetail 10.2.1 I’m not sure though, if I should go for an update or not since Internet is poisoned about 30% battery bug in ios 10. I’m new to iPhone, have almost no past experience of ios. As of now I am pretty satisfied with ios 9.3.3 just sometimes it becomes difficult to click on( x) while trying to close search box with some other minor hiccups, don’t know if it’s a software issue or hardware on my device. I’m kinda liking the health app. Although it is not measuring the floors climbed while it’s counting the steps taken. I am told it will count the floors climbed after I updated to 10.2.1 which kind of sounds weird. Please suggest me the right course of action. By the way what’s Jailbreak? Hoping to hear from you soon. 03/03/2017 Natasha Reply Updated to 10.2.1 yesterday and my phone wont start at all and has been at the Apple logo + loading bar screen for over 24 hours. :( Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

The company is a market leader in many fields, and would often rather abandon a product category rather than struggle on as a minor competitor to bigger and better rivals. But even mighty Apple does the occasional swing-and-a-miss routine. And some of Cupertino's whiffs come in vibrant billion-dollar markets. Image source: Getty Images. Apple ranks dead last in the $24 billion file-hosting market Brand Keys is a branding consultancy firm with more than three decades of expertise-building history under its belt. The firm is best known for its Customer Loyalty Engagement Index (CLEI) rankings, where a proprietary data-collection process builds customer-loyalty ratings in more than 80 specific product categories. Apple, of course, dominates several of the latest Brand Keys ratings. The iPhone shows up all comers in the smartphone category, no tablet can beat the iPad's consumer loyalty, and MacBooks walks away with the top rating among laptop brands. In something of an upset, Apple Music even takes home the online music segment. And then there's the file-storage category. There, Apple doesn't just miss the top spot, but falls all the way to the bottom of 13 ranked services. How bad is that result for Apple? To be clear, Brand Keys claims that its measurements translate directly into future sales prospects and revenues. According to independent metrics from Markets and Markets, cloud storage is a $24 billion market today -- and expected to reach annual sales of $75 billion in just five years. In other words, it looks like Apple is leaving a lot of cash on the table. The iCloud file-storage service is not pulling its weight, or moving the needle for Apple. Instead, consumers with a need for off-site file-storage tools prefer free services like Brand Keys' category winner, Sabrecat -- or a plethora of better-known options such as runner-up Dropbox, or third-place finisher Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Drive. Apple is not only missing a significant market opportunity, but leaving a lot of that cash for Google parent Alphabet to grab instead. Apple CEO Tim Cook. Image source: Apple. Why is Apple missing the boat? Apple's iCloud is, in many ways, very similar to Google Drive and Dropbox. All three services allow users to store nearly any type of file in a centrally managed cloud server, accessible from any networked computer. They all come with small storage limits for a free account, all offer a terabyte of storage for $9.99 per month, and come with various tools for managing your stored files. But Apple does a few things differently. First and foremost, the easiest way to access iCloud content is via an iPhone, iPad, or MacBook. In fact, signing up for an iCloud account is part of the setup process for all of these systems. Then, the service is integrated into your Apple experience as the destination for system backup files, the default storage location for files created in the iWork office suite, and an option for storing user files in newer versions of the macOS system. All of this is designed to keep users tightly bound to Apple's multi-device ecosystem. Once you're in, it's not easy to get untangled. Given Apple's massive market reach, especially in the tablet and smartphone segments, this alone should make iCloud a winner. Apple CEO Tim Cook introduced the package as "a strategy for the next decade" in 2012. However, Apple never quite delivered on that grand ambition. iCloud is reportedly ostracized by other working groups within the company, starved of resources, and mostly seen as a necessary evil. Apple is a product company, and iCloud is not a marketable product on its own -- at least not in its current Apple-centric form. So, this odd piece of infrastructure machinery is left out in the cold. And there goes Apple's ticket to a $24 billion industry that's also on a rapid growth tear. Google sure is building its Drive product into everything from Gmail to mobile photo storage to storage space for corporate accounts. Dropbox is doing the same, while on the lookout for another buyout bid. And this market should only grow faster as the Internet of Things grows up, requiring acres of cloud-based storage space. These companies treat online file storage as an important business, valuable on its own merits. Apple doesn't. Hence, the company is holding back on promoting iCloud, developing it further, or building it into other products, when appropriate. Cupertino misses out on a major growth story, with absolutely no loyalty from the customers who do sign up.

As was standard for the time, it came in 16/64/128GB configurations. Since then, Apple has bumped the base storage options on new iPhones to 32GB, but the 16GB iPhone 6 (and iPhone SE) have remained on sale. So it’s a little unusual that Apple has put a 32GB iPhone 6 on sale in China in a gold color. What’s even stranger is that the phone isn’t available through Apple retail channels, but instead only through Taiwan Mobile. Don't Miss: The first ‘Deadpool 2’ teaser is here, and it’s hilarious 9to5Mac spotted that Taiwan Mobile is pushing the gold 32GB iPhone 6 as an exclusive offer on its network as the cheapest iPhone ever. It’s only being sold as part of a monthly contract, so it’s difficult to compare the cost to the iPhone SE or iPhone 6 in North America, but it does seem to be cheap. Adding a 32GB iPhone 6 option for the low-end is a confusing move for Apple. The iPhone SE is meant to fill the niche for a cheap(er) iPhone, and making the storage on the 6 bigger than the SE might cannibalize sales for Apple. At the same time, it might work as a way to sell people on a cheap iPhone that doesn’t look cheap. While the SE is visually an iPhone from years ago, the iPhone 6 still looks mostly identical to the more modern iPhone 7. It’s still unclear if the iPhone SE is going to get a spec bump this year. The original SE debuted in the spring of 2016, so sometime in the next few months would be the time to update it, assuming Apple sticks to its regular update cycle.

IDC New Zealand reports Apple shipped less than 1000 more detachable or slate devices than Microsoft in 2016. The total market for the year was 80,000 units. Apple had a 32 percent market share, which is around 25,600 units. Microsoft was at 31 percent, a shade under 25,000 units. Detachable is a curious market to measure. IDC defines it: "A slate tablet is a portable, battery-powered computing device with a screen size 7-inches to 16-inches. In addition to the attributes of a slate tablet, a detachable tablet is designed to function as a stand-alone slate tablet as well as a clamshell device through the addition of a detachable keyboard designed specifically for the device." IDC New Zealand mobile device market analyst Chayse Gorton says this includes Apple's 12.9-inch and 9.7-inch iPad Pros. Yet both sell without detachable keyboards and not every buyer uses them with one1. The category includes Microsoft Surface Pro and Surface Book, HP Envy and others. It is distinct from traditional laptops. The distinction between slates and tablets like non-Pro iPads is blurry. Either way, Apple topped the market in 2016. Microsoft is second. It had been number one for the years 2013, 2014 and 2015. Microsoft's shipments climbed three percent from 2015 to 2016. It was a bonza year for detachable sales. Shipments2 increased from 55,000 in 2015 to 80,000 — a year-on-year increase of 45 percent. The runners-up are, in order: HP on nine percent; Samsung on seven percent and Acer also with seven percent. Other brands were less than 15%. Gorton says Microsoft faces competition from a range of models running Windows. Its share of the Windows detachable market fell from 58 percent in 2015 to 50 percent in 2016. "Competing windows detachables often have similar specifications to Microsoft detachables, but are frequently sold at a lower price. Given New Zealand is a price conscious nation, a lower price, even by small a margin can be enough to entice a consumer to purchase from a competing vendor", he says. Gorton says Microsoft sharpened its premium market position introducing high-end models and halting low-end models. It introduced the Surface Book early in the year and dropped the Surface 3 from its line-up. IDC expects detachable shipments to grow between 25 and 30 percent in 2017. From the market will start to flatten off. You could argue the iPad Pro and Windows devices are not direct head-to-head rivals. It's possible there are buyers who would weigh up an iPad Pro against these Windows devices. Yet for the most part the two groups inhabit parallel universes. Shipments is a normal term for this kind of survey. Most of the time it means how many devices vendors sent from warehouses to retailers. It gets tricky with detachable because Apple and Microsoft sell direct.

Phones by Richard Trenholm February 28, 2017 4:14 AM PST @rich_trenholm Enlarge Image Apple's iPhone 7 committed to Lightning over the traditional headphone jack. Screenshot by Óscar Gutiérrez/CNET Apple's iPhone could celebrate its 10th birthday with a curved screen and USB-C connection. According to the Wall Street Journal, at least one model in Apple's next update to the iPhone range could have a curved OLED screen, similar to the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. More intriguingly, the Journal quotes anonymous sources claiming the new iPhone would ditch Apple's proprietary Lightning connection for USB-C. USB cables for syncing and charging are standard across the mobile industry, but Apple has always stuck with its own charging connection. Shifting to USB-C would be a huge move for Apple. It would also be a surprise, as Apple's iPhone 7 controversially moved away from another industry standard, the 3.5mm headphone jack, in favor of Lightning. With that commitment to Lightning in mind, you may want to take this little rumor with a pinch of salt. The report also suggested an end to the home button, which would free space for a slimmer bezel -- but it's not clear where Apple would put the fingerprint scanner. Apple has yet to respond to a request for comment. Correction, 6:24 a.m. PT: This story originally misstated the industry-standard headphone jack size. It is 3.5mm. Does the Mac still matter? Apple execs tell why the MacBook Pro was over four years in the making, and why we should care. It's Complicated: This is dating in the age of apps. Having fun yet?

The first, called ‘take better notes’ starts, like similar recent videos, with a tweet: ‘My math notes are a mess since I’m half asleep.’ In response, the narrator explains ‘You know, iPad Pro and Apple Pencil have revolutionized the way we take notes.’ The camera cuts to someone taking notes in Notability, the note-taking app that Federico highlighted in the iPad Diaries this week. The spot concludes with the narrator pointing out that even if you fall asleep, you’re covered if you use Notability’s audio recording feature. The second video is called ‘need less stuff,’ which emphasizes the ways the iPad Pro can cut down on clutter in your life. In response to a ‘There are way too many things on my desk’ tweet, the narrator explains that an iPad Pro can replace a scanner, a pad of paper, and laptop, using the iPad version of Procreate as the example of an app that replaces a pad of paper. Apple continues to strike a nice balance with these videos, highlighting a couple features of the iPad Pro that set it apart from a laptop or smart phone but keeping the tone light and humorous by responding to the sort of frustrated tweets with which many people are all too familiar.

For most folks, the fact that Macs hold their value is owed to how long the computers last. Even so, we can recognize the signs of a Mac that’s not quite in its prime anymore. Booting it up seems to take forever, the latest features of macOS just aren’t enjoyable, and modern software seems to drag. Don’t rush right out to buy a new computer when that happens, though. There may be a few things you can do to an old Mac to make it feel new again. Upgrading your older Mac could be preferable to buying a new one. (Image Credit: Kamyar Rad) Recognizing When Your Older Mac Isn’t Worth the Upgrade First, let’s set the record straight. I’m not saying you can revitalize that old PowerBook G4 and run macOS Sierra. There are limits, after all. You should start off by ensuring your Mac is on the list of models supported by macOS Sierra. You’ll also want to make sure you have at least 2GB of memory and 8.8GB of storage space. Check out your Mac’s specs from About This Mac from the Apple menu. About This Mac will tell you how much memory and storage space your older Mac currently has. Upgrade Your Hard Drive to SSD If your older Mac still has a mechanical hard drive, the best upgrade you can make to revitalize it is to replace that disk with a solid-state drive (SSD). SSD drives don’t have any moving parts, so they’re exponentially faster than their older counterparts. Upgrading to an SSD drive might not be cheap, but it’s less expensive than purchasing a new Mac. You’ll reap the benefits of an SSD in a number of areas – booting up, opening apps, and moving files around. Make sure you can make the swap without too much trouble. You should also be sure to pick an SSD that’s compatible with Mac. Crucial’s Mac SSD compatibility page is a good place to start, as is Other World Computing. Both sites offer installation guides to help you know what’s involved in the job. Increase Your Mac’s Memory The next best upgrade you can perform on an older Mac is to upgrade the system memory. An SSD improves performance in just about every aspect, but more RAM will allow you to have more apps running at once without slowing things down. You can find out how much memory you already have by looking back at About This Mac. EveryMac’s Actual Maximum RAM page will tell you how much you can upgrade. Apple’s official specifications are sometimes understated. If you have a MacBook Pro Retina from 2012 to present, you won’t be able to upgrade the memory at all. Once you’ve determined whether you can upgrade your Mac’s memory, check out either Crucial’s Mac memory finder page or Other World Computing. Clear Out the Apps You Don’t Use This tip won’t cost you any money at all. If you’ve been using your older Mac for a while, you probably have quite a few applications that you installed but never use anymore. It’s a good idea to do “spring cleaning” once in a while to clear out those apps and their associated library and preferences files. Removing these unused and possibly outdated applications could even give you a performance boost, since those apps might still be loading files in the background. For sure, they’re taking up precious hard drive space. Make sure they’re completely cleared out by using a tool that hunts down all of the extra files associated with those apps. I like the free and simple-to-use AppCleaner. All you have to do is drag the unused apps onto the window, and AppCleaner does all the rest. AppCleaner in action. Do a Clean Install of macOS Sierra Finally, you might consider doing a fresh install of the operating system. Windows users do this more often than Mac, but it’s still an option that can sometimes give you even more of a performance boost. As John Martellaro points out, this is often unnecessary and is always a time-intensive process, but you might decide to forge ahead with it anyways. Be sure to read his entire article before you begin, since he outlines the best way to accomplish the clean install. A Brand New Mac, Almost After upgrading your memory and swapping to a SSD, your older Mac should feel new again. You’ll be able to get a bit more time out of your Mac, and it’s a less expensive option than buying a whole new computer. Of course, Apple continues to blaze forward, and might “sunset” your Mac with the next version of macOS. Weigh the pros and cons of upgrading versus buying new. If your Mac is from 2012 or later, you’ll probably find the upgrades to be the wisest investment.

It began to take 90 seconds to boot in 2013 so I maxed the RAM to 4GB and installed a 256GB SSD, It was like a new computer, booting in 22 seconds. Purchased the 256SSD AND two modules of 2GB from Other World Computing for about $150.00. Even though Apple doesn’t support it, it continues to run great. You may not be able to run the latest version of Safari, my youngest son has been running Chrome, which does the job. I teach college classes and my 10 year old (in June) Mac eats much newer Microsoft machines for lunch. I have even witnessed more than one Microsoft machine dying in class at the same time, very sad. So, even if your older Mac isn’t supported doesn’t mean you have to upgrade. I upgraded to a 2012 Macbook Pro 15inch in 2014, what I found interesting was that the 2007 was faster than then 2012 with an Intel 2.3 GHz Intel Core i7 Quad Core proccessor. I immediately replaced the HDD with a 500GB SSD, immediately booted in 12 seconds. March 5, 2017 at 9:14 EST AM Russ Hilton March 5, 2017 Forgot to mention that the 2007 still boots in 22 seconds, four years after the upgrade. March 5, 2017 at 9:16 EST AM Jeff Butts March 5, 2017 Thanks for the comment, Russ! Yeah, it’s amazing how much difference the SSD can make. March 5, 2017 at 4:39 EST PM trahajje March 5, 2017 I’m thinking about putting an ssd in a Mid-2010 27″ iMac. My biggest fear is that Apple will “sunset” that model later this year. Does Apple continue to offer security fixes for older operating systems? If so, for how long? March 5, 2017 at 10:42 EST PM Carl Camp March 6, 2017 Russ, I’d love to know where you found a SATA 1.5G SSD Drive, I have the previous model MacBook that I had to use a Seagate Hybrid Drive because the every SSD I tried did not slow dow to SATA1 specs as they claimed. The Venerable MacBooks are great machines even with OS X.7.5 as the best OS possible. Help us out, what brand SSD and where did you find it? March 6, 2017 at 12:48 EST AM fultonkbd March 6, 2017 I upgraded a 2009 iMac with an SSD and maxed out the RAM and it definitely worth the costs. Before it was just too slow to do much of anything. Now I’m back to using daily. March 6, 2017 at 10:45 EST AM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

Instead, Apple will stick with the Lightning conector and add support for USB Type-C power delivery for faster charging. Apple isn’t killing the iPhone’s Lighting connector after all Earlier this week the Wall Street Journal reported the iPhone 8 would sport USB-C instead of a Lightning connector, which didn’t sound like a change Apple would make this year. I suspected the sources misinterpreted what they knew, and instead Apple would include a Lightning to USB-C cable in the box. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo told investors, “We believe all three new iPhones launching in 2H17 will support fast charging by the adoption of Type-C Power Delivery technology (while still retaining the Lightning port).” My hypothesis still stands, and it looks like now we know where the misinterpretation happened. Type-C power delivery will be built into the Lightning connector, and it’ll be supported on all of this year’s iPhone modes and not just the 8. Translation: Apple is including a Lightning to USB-C cable with this year’s iPhone models, and they’ll let our smartphones charge faster than before. Faster charging is great, but it comes at a price. If you don’t have a Mac with USB-C support (right now, that’s the MacBook and late 2016 MacBook Pro) you can’t connect your iPhone without an adapter or a traditional Lightning to USB A cable. In essence, Apple will push the need for a dongle back to older computers. Adding Type-C charging won’t help older iPhones or iPads juice up any quicker even though the new cable will support it. Type-C charging requires compatible chips, likely coming from Cypress and Texas Instruments, so connecting the new charger system to an iPhone 7 or older won’t have any benefit. The still rumored iPhone 8 is expected to include an edge-to-edge OLED screen, an on screen finger print reading zone for Touch ID instead of a Home button, 3D sensing front-facing camera, wireless charging support, and more. It’s expected to be announced this fall along with the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus, but will ship a few weeks later than the other models.

Digital Trends Home > Computing > The Oculus Rift on MacOS isn’t exactly dead… The Oculus Rift on MacOS isn’t exactly dead, but it’s not on the road map either By Kevin Parrish — March 1, 2017 4:37 PM Subscribe Share Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Why it matters to you Apple customers hoping that the Oculus Rift VR headset will officially be supported on their devices may be waiting indefinitely until proper hardware comes along. Support for the Oculus Rift virtual reality headset on MacOS isn’t dead but it’s not arriving anytime in the near future, either. Oculus VR co-founder Nate Mitchell said in a recent interview that supporting Apple’s platform was “something near and dear” to his heart, but the company currently isn’t in the position to fully dive into bringing the Rift headset to MacOS. “We do want to do OS X (MacOS) support for Rift. It’s not something that’s currently on the roadmap for — I can even say — the next six months,” Mitchell said. “We will continue to revisit it. The real challenge for us is just how much we invest into that space because it does require a lot of our time and energy to get it right and to deliver a great experience.” More: Google’s Tilt Brush arrives for Oculus Rift, redesigned for Touch controllers Right now, the OSVR headset is the only high-resolution PC-based solution that can work on MacOS. OSVR is an open-source platform created by Razer and Sensics that is supported by Steam. The platform is still in the development kit stage, with the HDK2 model selling for $400. Getting the headset to install on MacOS appears to require Homebrew first to load and run the OSVR software. That said, the HTC Vive VR headset isn’t exactly MacOS friendly either. As with the Oculus Rift, the HTC Vive requires a certain level of hardware performance that MacOS-based devices currently cannot provide. That is been the big holdup with bringing the Oculus Rift to MacOS all along, with Oculus VR founder Palmer Luckey stating that the hardware just isn’t there for the Rift headset. Still, MacOS devices will undoubtedly have the necessary components in the future to run VR headsets. However, right now, the curvy MacPro desktop sports AMD FirePro D300 and D500 graphics, which falls under the Vive and Rift requirements. The new MacBook Pros are based on integrated Intel graphics, which is nowhere close to what the VR headsets need. Of course, Oculus VR will likely jump into full MacOS support when capable devices hit the market. That may not be until late 2017 or sometime in 2018. However, given Apple’s partnership with AMD, customers could very well see hardware solutions before the end of the year that are based on AMD’s upcoming Radeon RX Vega family, or the rumored Radeon RX 400 Series refresh rebranded as the 500 Series. Oculus VR and parent company Facebook started 2017 off with a bang by reducing the price of the Rift headset and the Touch controllers. As a bundle, the setup now costs $598 whereas the headset alone now costs $499, the Touch controller pair costs $99, and the sensor retails for $59. That is $200 off the bundle’s original price tag. According to Mitchell, the price hack was meant to drive Rift users to the Touch controllers, which have done well since their debut in December. Thus, by the time the Oculus Rift is officially supported on MacOS, the setup and the required hardware could be very affordable.

Microsoft and Google Defeat Apple in Schools As iPads and MacBooks Hit New Low GO Research shows use of Apple devices collapses in the US Mar 3, 2017 22:37 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  Microsoft and Google both experienced substantial increases in the education sector, while Cupertino-based rival Apple hit a new low last year, according to a new report. Futuresource Consulting says in a research that Google is the leading choice in the classroom in the United States, while Microsoft’s Windows has become the runner-up. At the same time, Apple’s devices have turned from leaders to one of the last choices, losing ground lately due to the lack of innovations. Specifically, the research shows that, in the United States, Chromebooks are the number one choice with no less than 58 percent share, while Windows comes second with 22 percent. iOS fell to third place with 14 percent, down from 19 percent, while Linux is the last one with 5 percent. Chromebooks experienced the biggest change versus 2015, as it managed to improve shipments by 8 percent. A total of 12.6 million devices were sold to schools in 2016, and more than half of them were Chromebooks, the research indicates. As far as the rest of the world is concerned, Windows is the dominating choice here with 65 percent, while Android is second with 17 percent. iOS is third with 9 percent, followed by Chrome OS with 6 percent. Microsoft and Google likely to continue growth Both Microsoft and Google are expected to grow in education, mostly as a result of investments in 2-in-1s and the growing number of OEMs building devices that come with detachable keyboards. 2-in-1 devices have become Microsoft’s own obsession, as the Redmond-based software giant itself pioneered this product category with its own Surface lineup. These devices bring a series of advantages for customers in the education sectors, as they can be used as both tablets and laptops, having a detachable keyboard and touchscreen. “Both Microsoft and Google (and their respective partners) have announced a wide range of 2-in-1 products designed specifically for education and are expected to sell for under $300. The 2-in-1 form factor is ideal for education, providing schools with flexibility in usage,” the research reads. Apple is also investing in 2-in-1s, but the bigger price point seems to significantly affect adoption in schools, so it’ll be interesting to see how Cupertino tackles the growth of Google and Microsoft in this industry. #Microsoft#Google#Apple#Surface#Windows subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Microsoft Loses First Place to Apple in NZ 2-in-1 Battle Better Late than Never: Microsoft Surface Now Supports Wake on LAN New Windows Phone Spotted at MWC 2017 MediaTek Says No to Windows 10 on ARM Because It’s a Risky Idea Third-Party Windows Updates Kind of Risky, Security Expert Says Google May Ditch 3.5mm Headphone Jacks on Next Pixel Phones AMD Rolls Out Its New Crimson ReLive Graphics Driver - Get Version 17.3.1 Google Play Celebrates Five Years, Here Are the Most Downloaded Games and Apps Samsung Confirms Delay of Android Nougat Update to Galaxy S6 and S6 edge Third-Party Windows Updates Kind of Risky, Security Expert Says Google May Ditch 3.5mm Headphone Jacks on Next Pixel Phones AMD Rolls Out Its New Crimson ReLive Graphics Driver - Get Version 17.3.1    Apple losing ground in US schools New Apps Remove VBA Password: Remove password-protected VBA files in order to gain access to Excel, Word, PowerPoint, Outlook, and other tools, and apply the process to passwords of any length and character set Vectr: Seamlessly develop graphic elements that you can use for your website, business-card, T-shirt or applications using this intuitive program Arclab Website Link Analyzer: SEO optimization tool that can analyze a website to help you find broken links and other problems that might result in a lower search engine ranking Reimage: Assess you computer's stability and discover any possible security issues with the help of this PC repair tool that improves your machine's performance A1 Website Scraper: Scrape information from websites by using crawlers that can be customized to extract the specified type of data and save the results on your local drive A1 Sitemap Generator: An efficient and reliable application that performs various automatic tasks such as scan website, build sitemap and FTP sitemap upload Stellar Phoenix Mailbox Exchange Recovery: A comprehensive application that enables you to recover EDB files from corrupt or damaged servers, in a quick and effortless manner Reader comments Apple Makes Fun of Windows, Says Its iPad Pro Doesn’t Get Any Virus more on: Apple i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Apple Valley girl 'socked' with love and magic Friday Mar 3, 2017 at 2:34 PM Mar 3, 2017 at 2:34 PM Mia Clayton was recently awarded a $500 Disney Summer of Service grant thanks to the Youth Service America. Funds from the grant will allow young Mia to continue purchasing socks and other necessities for those in need. Monica Solano Staff Writer @DP_MonicaInes APPLE VALLEY —  For Mia Clayton, providing for those in need of warm feet has become a passion. The 7-year-old aims to continue helping the homeless, too, one pair of socks at a time.    “I like helping because I want them to be happy and feel loved,” Mia happily said. “I have been helping the homeless since kindergarden.”   The second-grader from Apple Valley was recently awarded a $500 Disney Summer of Service grant thanks to Youth Service America (YSA), a resource center that partners with thousands of organizations committed to increasing the quality and quantity of volunteer opportunities for young people ages 5 to 25 in order to serve locally, nationally and globally. Mia was one of 340 young leaders across the country awarded a grant for her nonprofit organization, Mia's Boxes of Love. The grant will support Mia in her continued efforts and community service project addressing the issue of helping to relieve the symptoms of homelessness by collecting essentials for families in need throughout the High Desert. “Mia was pretty excited to hear about the grant, especially since she loves Disney and is a huge fan of Disneyland and Disney channel,” said her father, Nicholas Clayton. “For her to have seen the Disney logo on the letter, that was a big deal for her. (And) really for Mia this has been a driving force for her since the beginning. She's always wanted to help out as many people as much as possible.” Expressing her love for “Finding Dory” while happily sharing her thoughts on the new Disney Animated Film “Moana," Mia has teamed with more than a dozen local schools and businesses in the Victor Valley to help collect socks to donate to local rescues. “I think she’s just been overwhelmed by everyone’s reaction, seeing as she really wants to help out and her mission is to give back to the community,” Clayton said. “We’ve had so much support over the years from families and the Rescue Mission and every one of her friends and staff from the Victor Valley Elementary School District.”  Known as a nationwide annual campaign, “Socktober” was popularized by Sesame Street and American personality Robby Novak, aka Kid President. Mia first heard about “Socktober” after watching one of Novak's Youtube videos when she was 4 years old. That inspired Mia to start the fundraiser locally.   Over the course of three years since Mia first began her organization in 2014, now a nonprofit project under the High Desert Community Foundation, the young dreamer has collected close to 18,000 pairs of socks to hand out to the homeless, according to Clayton. “I like helping and I like that they get to have warm feet,” Mia said.  Having worked with families in 13 schools in the High Desert and mobilized thousands of students to collect 8,000 new pairs of socks last October, Mia expressed her love for helping others, saying she would like “to change the world” as she looks forward to purchasing more socks with the grant and delivering them herself to the shelters in need this spring.    Those who would like to donate socks can visit any donation drop-off site listed on Mia's website, miasboxesoflove.org, which include all school sites within Victor Elementary School District.

Image: Emojipedia By Damon Beres2017-03-03 22:14:55 UTC Hey! Did you know that 68 percent of the people who work at Apple are dudes? That tech darlings like Uber have rampant sexism problems? And that only 4 percent of CEOs in the Fortune 500 are women?  And who would have thought it: That male-dominated culture seems to have dripped into something as innocent as your iPhone's emoji suggestions. SEE ALSO: Two determined women take on tech industry sexism in a new Secret ad If you type in leadership roles like "ceo," "cfo" or "cto" using the default keyboard in iOS, the emoji it suggests will be the default male in a suit, Mashable noticed Friday—even if you include a gendered context word like "she's" in the sentence you're composing. Men, men, men! Just like you'd see in Silicon Valley. Some caveats: We're not entirely sure how Apple's predictive text suggestions work, particularly when it comes to emoji, which were added as options only last year. The company did not immediately respond to our request for comment. Predictive text supposedly learns from your own texting habits, though it's possible that it also pulls in some aggregate data from other users to make better suggestions. There may also be a technical reason this is happening. Emoji are created using a standard called Unicode. A man's face is generated using the code U+1F468, while a female is generated with U+1F469. Because the code for a female character is a number higher than the code for a male, it's possible that the dude comes up by default. (See that? She's already a step behind.) Whatever the case, a number of Mashable staffers tried typing in the terms and confirmed that the emoji worked the same way by default for acronyms like "CFO" on their iPhones. You may see something different depending on your autofill or predictive text settings. In all fairness to Apple, iOS has generally been ahead of the competition when it comes to diverse emoji. It proposed female emoji variations for a few new professions last year, and if you type in one of them—firefighter, say—you'll get an emoji prediction for each gender: Note also that the female businesswoman emoji sometimes is suggested alongside her male counterpart: Capitalize "CEO" rather than using all lowercase and she will appear (not that anyone texts with Caps Lock on).  The female businesswoman also appears when you use iOS 10's "emoji replacement" option, which highlights key words that can be replaced by the iconic little characters. Better yet, she's even displayed ahead of that doofy guy with the mustache: So, no, this isn't a crisis per se for gender equality, but it does speak to how teeny biases can be communicated in everyday scenarios. Egregious? No. But worth considering in some layer of the massive dirt pie that is Big Tech's sexism problems? Absolutely. Thanks for the tip, Shelby Simon! Freia Lobo contributed reporting.

Apple is not done, however, having now sued Qualcomm in a court in the United Kingdom. This latest lawsuit was initially lodged on January 23, but Qualcomm had not seen the claim at the time, and could not comment. Court records show the filing made March 2 concerns registered designs and patents but does not list which ones. Apple's move comes as a result of a push from phone makers and regulators to reduce the excessive royalties Qualcomm charges. Though a big chunk of the latter's revenue comes from selling chips, more than half of the company's total earnings are generated via separate licensing deals. In regards to this very subject, the iPhone-maker stated previously that Qualcomm had "unfairly insisted on charging royalties for technologies they have nothing to do with". Unlike the two previously initiated legal battles, this third one has no concrete amount of money linked to it. Regardless of the sum, this is no doubt a big thorn in Qualcomm's side.

Esteemed Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo today chimed in on the speculation, writing that all three next-generation iPhone models will retain the Lightning port. Instead, the Big A will likely introduce a series of internal changes to accommodate the much-desired fast charging capability. “This event was off the charts” Gary Vaynerchuk was so impressed with TNW Conference 2016 he paused mid-talk to applaud us. FIND OUT WHY The hardware tweaks will ultimately enable Apple to replicate some of the power benefits that come with USB Type-C and still maintain its signature Lightning connector. As 9to5Mac remarks, it remains unclear whether this rumor has any relation to previous reports about wireless charging. Kuo further noted that although USB-C would certainly trump the capabilities of the Lightning connector, the Cupertino heavyweight has little incentive to make the transition. The report makes no reference as to how the possible adoption of USB-C fits in with the rest of the Apple ecosystem and upcoming iPad lineup. As of now, the two primary reasons Kuo lists for sticking with Lightning are royalties from licensing deals as well as the compact size of the technology, which allows Apple to cram more tech into a smaller body. As we mentioned in our initial coverage, while Apple would indeed lose some revenue from licensing deals, the transition to USB-C makes sense in light of the latest lineup of MacBook Pros – especially since the switch will enable customers to use the same cable for both their phones and laptops. In any case, chances are we’ll likely have to wait at least one more year until Apple finally decides to make a radical design change in the iPhone that also happens to be user-friendly.

In 2016, 58% of the 12.6 million mobile computers shipped to educational customers -- or approximately 7.3 million -- were powered by Chrome OS, up from 50% of 2015's 10.7 million (or 5.35 million), U.K.-based Futuresource Consulting said in a report yesterday. Meanwhile, Apple's OS X/macOS and iOS operating systems -- which power Macs and iPads, respectively -- fell from a combined 25% share in 2015 (or 2.7 million devices) to 19% in 2016 (or 2.4 million). Futuresource counted laptops, tablets, Chromebooks and the aged category dubbed "netbooks," but omitted desktop computers in its tallies. The downturn in Apple's K-12 fate last year was the second consecutive decline, according to Futuresource: In 2014, OS X + iOS accounted for 34% of educational mobile computer shipments in the U.S. That year, Chrome OS's share was 38%. While Apple's share was falling and Google's was climbing, Microsoft's remained stable, said Futuresource: Windows powered 25% of the shipped computers in 2014, dipped to 22% the next year and held steady at the same share in 2016. Apple's educational reputation harks back nearly 40 years, with roots in the Apple IIe that became the de facto educational computer in the K-12 world. But the higher prices of the Mac successor, and continued premium cost of the company's iPad from 2010 on, allowed first the Windows PC and then later, Chromebooks, to curry favor because of their lower acquisition costs. Futuresource cited Chromebooks' affordability and manageability as selling points, but not surprisingly in an environment where school district dollars are ever more precious, stressed the former above all else. "The rise of Chromebooks has also set new industry benchmarks with regards to average device pricing, with prices reaching as low as $120 on certain projects," the research firm said. Microsoft has announced initiatives to better compete with Chrome OS -- an attempt to move Windows' share from its mid-20s mark -- such as January's trumpeting of Windows 10 devices as low as $189, and Intune for Education, cloud-based device management priced at $30 per machine, the same Google charges for its Chrome OS management suite. The Redmond, Wash. company is also reportedly working on a new edition of Windows 10, tagged as "Windows 10 Cloud," to power Chromebook competitors. Even so, Microsoft "continues to face challenges to win back end-user mindshare" in the educational space, said Mike Fisher, an analyst at Futuresource, in a Thursday statement. Futuresource Consulting Apple's share of the U.S. K-12 educational market has slipped two years running, while Chrome OS's has climbed to claim the largest chunk by far.

Many MSPs are seen to be stuck in the same comfort cycle of doing business within the few markets that they are comfortable in, but delivering stellar growth goes beyond doing just that; they need to take risks and branch out, or risk being gone. This exclusive ARN roundtable, in association with SolarWinds MSP, addressed key trends in the market for MSPs, diversifying areas of play – from SMB through to mid-market and enterprise, lucrative verticals, the importance of strategic alliances, as well as expanding into niche areas such as cybersecurity and ransomware and using them as a hook for customer conversations.

While Apple's share was falling and Google's was climbing, Microsoft's remained stable, said Futuresource: Windows powered 25% of the shipped computers in 2014, dipped to 22% the next year and held steady at the same share in 2016. Apple's educational reputation harks back nearly 40 years, with roots in the Apple IIe that became the de facto educational computer in the K-12 world. But the higher prices of the Mac successor, and continued premium cost of the company's iPad from 2010 on, allowed first the Windows PC and then later, Chromebooks, to curry favor because of their lower acquisition costs. Futuresource cited Chromebooks' affordability and manageability as selling points, but not surprisingly in an environment where school district dollars are ever more precious, stressed the former above all else. "The rise of Chromebooks has also set new industry benchmarks with regards to average device pricing, with prices reaching as low as $120 on certain projects," the research firm said. Microsoft has announced initiatives to better compete with Chrome OS -- an attempt to move Windows' share from its mid-20s mark -- such as January's trumpeting of Windows 10 devices as low as $189, and Intune for Education, cloud-based device management priced at $30 per machine, the same Google charges for its Chrome OS management suite. The Redmond, Wash. company is also reportedly working on a new edition of Windows 10, tagged as "Windows 10 Cloud," to power Chromebook competitors. Even so, Microsoft "continues to face challenges to win back end-user mindshare" in the educational space, said Mike Fisher, an analyst at Futuresource, in a Thursday statement. Futuresource Consulting Apple's share of the U.S. K-12 educational market has slipped two years running, while Chrome OS's has climbed to claim the largest chunk by far.

Zeman   @phonescooper Apple is taking Qualcomm to court in the U.K. over patent-licensing fees. Apple filed a similar lawsuit against Qualcomm in the U.S. Apple alleges that Qualcomm using unfair practices to license its chips and technology. At the heart of the matter is how Qualcomm works its contracts. It charges companies to use its chips, including mobile processors and cellular radios, but also charges a separate technology licensing fee that's based on the total retail price of the device in which the chips are used. Apple says Qualcomm "unfairly insisted on charging royalties for technologies they have nothing to do with." The FTC in the U.S. and the associated governmental bodies in the European Union and in Korea have filed similar complaints against Qualcomm. The FTC's complaint revealed that Qualcomm effectively forced Apple to use only Qualcomm chips for several versions of the iPhone. Qualcomm hasn't responded to Apple's latest legal action. more info at Bloomberg » Related Apple news   Apple phones AD Comments Start a new discussion You must log in to post.

A source indicated to The Post that Apple SVP Eddy Cue spoke to executives from Paramount Pictures as well as Sony’s TV and film units, suggesting that Apple is working on “something big.” Reports are that Apple has been vague about its ultimate goal in the discussions, however one executive who spoke with Apple was left with the impression that Apple is looking for a “transformative acquisition” rather than just making a deal to buy TV shows. However, the report also pulls in comments from several inside sources suggesting that Apple still isn’t entirely clear about what it’s own plans are, and may be just testing the waters. One source said that Apple appears to “have a lot of trepidation” about the world of Hollywood, while according to other insiders it’s not even clear exactly who is driving the effort. Several Apple executives including Eddy Cue,SVP of Internet Software and Services, Robert Knodrk, VP of Apple Content and Media Apps, and Apple Music chief Jimmy Iovine are reportedly talking to different people in Hollywood and each trying to arrange their own exclusive deals. As one insider told The Post, “They each want to be the guy, and they’re telling people, don’t deal with the other one,” while another insider said “They just haven’t figured it out.” A third insider who is familiar with Apple’s thinking said that he didn’t know “if Apple is fully committed” but did suggest that wouldn’t do it “as a startup” but would more likely make some kind of acquisition. Apple CEO Tim Cook acknowledged last month that Apple has “put its toe in the water” in the area of original content with projects like Carpool Karaoke and Planet of the Apps, however Apple Music chief Jimmy Iovine also clearly stated that Apple’s plans were about enhancing Apple Music in order to make “the music service a cultural point of reference” rather than looking to get into competition with services such as Netflix.

The service, owned by Spotify Ltd, has been growing at a breakneck pace. The company said that it had 30 million subscribers less than a year ago and 40 million subscribers by September last year. Apple, owner of the second-largest paid service, said last month that its streaming service has more than 20 million customers. Adding paying customers will help Spotify to pitch to investors, who expect the company to file for an initial public offering (IPO) and are looking for signs that the company can convert its growing subscriber base into a sustainable business.  Spotify, which is unprofitable, generates almost all of its sales from subscriptions, though the music service also has tens of millions of additional users who listen for free, supported by advertising. It charges a standard rate of US$9.99 (S$14.10) a month and also offers promotions and discounts, including a US$4.99 plan for students. Spotify and other paid streaming services have boosted the entire record industry. Recorded music sales grew by 7 per cent last year, the fastest pace since piracy obliterated sales nearly 20 years ago, according to a report from media research firm Midia. Streaming accounted for US$5.4 billion of US$16.1 billion in global record sales. While the growth has been good for most holders of music rights, it has also emboldened Spotify in negotiations with record labels. Spotify has not had long-term deals with any of the three major labels for months, and recent talks have reached a standstill, according to people familiar with the discussions, who asked not to be identified discussing private business matters.  Spotify does face some pressure to make a deal with labels to help reassure IPO investors. The clock is ticking. Investors in a previous fund-raising round have the right to turn their stakes into shares at a discount to the IPO price, with the discount growing if Spotify takes longer to go public.

The head of hardware at Google has confirmed that the firm is developing a second-generation Pixel for the ‘premium smartphone market’.  It is believed that the 'Pixel 2' could launch this fall, which would put the handset in direct competition with Apple's iPhone 8. Scroll down for video  The head of hardware at Google has confirmed that the firm is developing a second-generation Pixel (pictured is first-generation Pixel handsets)  for the ‘premium smartphone market’. It is believed that the 'Pixel 2' could launch this fall The confirmation comes from Rick Osterloh during an interview with AndroidPT. ‘There is an annual rhythm in the industry,’ Osterloh said in the interview. ‘So, you can count on us to follow it’ ‘You can count on a successor this year, even if you don't hear a date from me now."

Share this article Share 32 shares Google debuted the first smartphones in its Pixel line during a conference in October 2016, a Pixel and the 5.5-inch Pixel XL. Both phones are available in 32 GB ($649 for the Pixel, $769 for the XL) and 128 GB ($749 for the Pixel, $869 for the XL) – prices that surpass Apple’s iPhone line. Although the Pixel 2 release would fall around the same time as the iPhone 8, Google is focusing on the upper price segment of the market. The confirmation comes from Rick Osterloh during an interview with AndroidPT. Google’s second-generation phone (pictured is the original Pixel) would go head-to-head with Apple’s launch of its rumored iPhone 7s and highly-anticipated iPhone 8 Osterloh stated that ‘Pixel stays premium’ and the firm will ‘leave lower price segments to other manufacturers’. The firm launched the Pixel line around the same time as the iPhone 7 was revealed. 'We believe the next big thing will be at the intersection of hardware and software,’ Osterloh said in October. And he also took aim at Apple, saying the phone has 'no unsightly phone bump'. Brian Rakowski of Google said the phone was 'designed inside and out to be smart'. He said the Pixel's new camera was better than the iPhone 7. 'It's the best smartphone camera anyone has made,' he said. GOOGLE PIXEL SPECS  The Pixel runs on a Snapdragon 821 2.15GHz processor. The handsets come in 32GB or 128GB models, with microSD card slots enabling an additional 256GB of storage. The first-generation Pixel is be powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 chip They have 12.3 and 8-megapixel cameras and a full HD AMOLED screen with Gorilla Glass protection. Fast charging gives 7 hours of use in 15 minutes Included is Google's AI assistant, Allo for messaging and Duo for video calls. Free online storage for pictures and video Is be available in US on Verizon and in an unlocked version from $649.  The first-generation handset range includes two new phones, a Pixel and the 5.5-inch Pixel XL If a fall release date is in order, Google’s second-generation phone would go head-to-head with Apple’s launch of its rumored iPhone 7s and highly-anticipated iPhone 8 – which could give Google some competition. Apple’s upcoming flagship is said to be packed with cutting-edge technology and have a sleek design. The rumors, which have been surfacing since last year, suggest that the handset will have an OLED wraparound screen, biometric technology and even wireless charging. And although Google has its sights set on the premium market – the iPhone has been speculated to cost $1,000.   Read more: Pixel boss Rick Osterloh: Pixel 2 is coming this year and staying premium - AndroidPIT Share or comment on this article e-mail 32 shares Most watched News videos Leopards attack giant Rock Python in Kruger National Park The Walking Dead: New strain of spice turns homeless into zombies Woman stops car to beat passenger senseless on the road Louis Tomlinson challenges photographer before taking out fan Shocking video shows moment teenager is stabbed in South Norwood Droning on!: Neighbour tries to shoot down spying drone Violent brawl breaks out after man is savagely headbutted to floor Shocking video shows why Coke Zero really is better for you The Manly ferry tackles huge swells over the weekend Dash cam captures close drive-By shooting in Kansas Avalanche crashes down mountain at Russian ski resort Clever dog says 'I love you' to its owner to get treat PIERS MORGAN: Sorry Emma, but you haven’t done yourself...

In fact, last year we reviewed the duo’s last fitness tracker, Mi Band 2, with rave reviews. And now, Huami is back with a GPS enabled fitness smartwatch. Dubbed the Amazfit Pace, this rather affordable GPS tracker uses a customized version of Android Wear, features an always-on transflective touch screen, prompts you with notifications from your phone, and allows you to store music directly on it. Unlike most other GPS or fitness trackers, Huami’s goal with the Pace is an untethered experience. To get a firm grasp on its offerings, over a period of a month and a half, we took the Amazfit Pace on sweaty runs, an insane half-marathon trail run, and casual everyday use. 2/3/2017 Update: Shortly after publishing this review, Amazfit released a new software update that improves the GPS accuracy, adds cycling, and better data synching.  Features/Specs Unlike most other GPS enabled smartwatches, the Amazfit Pace has a very reasonable price tag of $160. By comparison, Garmin is one of the more popular GPS-enabled watch brands, and their most similar model costs $20 less, has a slightly less favorable battery life, a basic LED display, and receives push notifications from your phone. It also boasts some solid battery life with between 3-5 days of active tracking and 11 days of basic use. For serious runners, the price tag alone should be appealing, especially when it comes time to upgrade beyond advance step trackers like Fitbit; however, the watch is not without its shortcomings. GPS and Data Tracking As far as basics go, the Amazfit does a great job. Between GPS location tracking, heart rate monitoring, and sleep tracking, the smartwatch appears to be just as accurate as competing hardware. For example, we took the watch out while on a half-marathon trail run out in the wilderness, and the Amazfit accurately tracked distances and heart rate in parallel to the Apple Watch 2. Through several other outdoor runs in other environments, it continued to track with near identical results. Of the data tracked, the watch will pull: distance, time, pace, heart rate, calories, speed, cadence, maximum/average moving pace, max/avg moving speed, max/avg cadence, altitude, elevation gain, elevation loss, and min/max altitude. While the Amazfit Pace does have an integration with Strava, it’s limited in passing off data. It also does not support Google Fit or Apple Healthkit yet, which is a huge pain. Coaching Notifications are great, but data-based coaching is even better. The Amazfit touts a lot of different data points, and you can have it display more or less while in an activity. While on the go, you’ll get the basics, including vibration alerts, for when you hit mile markers, but there are other advanced settings. Unlike the Apple Watch, Amazfit also includes pace alerts. If you start to hit a pace slower than your target, it’ll notify you to pick up the pace. Other GPS trackers offer this as well, but cost a bit more money. Untethered One of the more unique features is that the watch allows you to store about 4GB worth of music on it. Using wireless or Bluetooth connected earbuds or speakers, you can then play music directly from the watch, rather than using your phone. This would be great in theory, except you can’t control the music while running, there is no way to shuffle it, and it just plays in a straight line. This could just be speaking from personal experience, but there is a lot of swapping of music during long distance running to find the right motivator. Overall, the Amazfit Pace is a great piece of hardware, is accurate with tracking, but has quite a few software shortcomings. Design GPS watches are not what we would call pretty or fashionable. Apple’s latest watch version has that edge over most competitors, but otherwise screens are often oversized, a bit bulky, and designed to take hits. Amazfit Pace on the other hand looks pretty damn good, but it’s still not something you’d likely wear during an evening out on the town. With a slightly oversized watch face, it boasts a ceramic bezel that allows it to look better and remain resistant to scratches. Amazfit also has an IP67 rating, which allows it to be water and dust resistant as well, but would not be ideal for swimming. It also uses standard watch bands, which means you can more easily customize it away from the flashier red/orange colors. Speaking of colors, the default base comes in either red or black, as do their bands. Generally speaking, the hardware itself looks nice, but once again has some issues tied to the software. Within that large screen size is an always-on transflective color LCD screen. In theory, this means the watch face will automatically adjust for the level of light hitting it, but due to the automatic settings it’s rather difficult to see in the dark. And, because there is no way to manually adjust the brightness, that is a huge pain. Like other trackers, the Amazfit also features several different watch faces; however, these too can’t be customized. Due to this being a Chinese watch converted for Americans, there are still some UI bugs to flesh out, such as forced 24 hour clocks instead of 12 hour clocks, and using Chinese audio queues alongside English text prompts. Overall the hardware looks great, can take the kinds of hits you’ll experience when running, but lacks customizations for watch faces and has issues with LCD brightness. Pros and Cons Highs Accurate GPS, sensors Lightweight, comfortable design Great display, sans brightness Lows Can’t adjust screen brightness Limited, custom Android Wear Limited data export Overall Thoughts Should you buy the Amazfit Pace? It depends. On one hand, we really dig the hardware. On the other, the software uses some sort of custom version of Android Wear, but it’s feature locked and over-simplified. In the future, we’d suspect that the software will improve to the point where the watch will better integrate with Apple Healthkit, Google Fit, or other fitness apps, but right now you’re stuck with a limited Strava connection. Software aside, the Amazfit has a decent active battery life, is physically designed well, and is accurate for tracking distance, heart rate, and sleep. We give the Amazfit Pace a 3.6 out of 5, but would still recommend it as a standalone, affordable GPS watch. It’s designed to be untethered from your smartphone, but currently it feels like that connection is more of an afterthought. If they fix up the English version of the software, the score would easily get a boost.

It is believed that the iPhone will not go into mass production until September, which has suggested that iOS users will not get their hands on one until October. The delay is a result of Apple’s custom fingerprint sensor that is set to replace the TouchID – the firm is building its own system and needs more time for manufacturing. Scroll down for video  The latest rumor regarding Apple’s flagship smartphone may send some fans into an uproar. It is believed that the iPhone will not go into mass production until September, which has suggested that iOS users will not get their hands on one until October (artist impressions) WHY THE DELAY?  The latest rumor about Apple's iPhone 8 suggest users may have to wait until Oct. to purchase one. Its believed that the firm is developing its own fingerprint sensor to replace the Touch ID, which is very complicated and needs more time to manufacture. And this means the firm will not start mass production of the handsets until Sept.  However, it may be worth the wait, as this technology will allow for a bezel-less design because the component will be a ‘built-in’ sensor integrated into the display. It is speculated that this component will use biometric technologies, instead of the traditional capacitive sensors found in Touch ID. It is also believed to be positioned in the ‘function area’ region of the display. Rumors surrounding the iPhone 8 began sweeping the web just a few months after Apple released the iPhone 7 line. And although the iPhone 7 sold out in a week, many saw it as nothing more than a refreshed iPhone 6 – which has put some pressure on Apple to impress its users. But with all the cutting-edge technology that is expected to be in the iPhone 8 design, many suggest that the Cupertino company is pulling out all the stops for the iPhone 8 family.  However, it seems that the new technology may push back the launch date, according to a new report from DigiTimes. It is suggested that Apple has passed over both the Synaptic’s Natural ID touch fingerprint sensor and Qualcomm’s Sense ID for the iPhone. It is, however, going with its own technology for a fingerprint recognition solution – Authentec algorithm combined with Privaris glass identification technology. ‘Apple's in-house developed fingerprint ID solution will be fabricated at TSMC's 12-inch line using 65nm process technology, sources told DigitTimes. The sources also said this move will push production for the OLED iPhone back until September, which means the handset will not go on sale until October. However, it may be worth the wait, as this technology will allow for a bezel-less design because the component will be a ‘built-in’ sensor integrated into the display, reports 9to5Mac.

Share this article Share 16 shares It is speculated that this component will use biometric technologies, instead of the traditional capacitive sensors found in Touch ID. It is also believed to be positioned in the ‘function area’ region of the display. The firm is going with its own technology for a fingerprint recognition solution – Authentec algorithm combined with Privaris glass identification technology. It is speculated that this component will use biometric technologies Although the delay could be a disappointment, Apple is one to stick close to a timeline when it comes to launching its devices, which is usually in September. And the last time the firm released a handset in October was the iPhone 4s. IPHONE 8 RUMORS   Several rumors have been circulating about the iPhone 8, and suggest the next device may have:  - Dual-lens 3D camera - Augmented reality to generate real-time views of surroundings  - Curved glass casing - Plastic OLED screen - Wireless charging - A folding element  - New 5 inch (12.7 centimeter) and 5.8 inch (14.7 centimeter) model, which will have a wraparound OLED screen  - 5.8 inch will be designed with the Touch ID finger print sensor 'under the glass and in the active display area' - A new 'pure white' model - Aluminum back will be replaced with two reinforced glass panes and a metal frame in the middle  - Facial recognition Other than speculating the release date, other reports have suggested that the iPhone 8 will come with a hefty price tag. Fast Company revealed earlier this month that the smartphone could cost $1,000. Surpassing the $1,000 (£800) mark may sound outrageous, but Apple has already released a smartphone that gets close to the price – the 256GB version of the iPhone 7 Plus costs $969 (£919). However, ‘the new iPhone 8 is expected to be packed with many more features,’ reports Mark Sullivan with Fast Company. Sources also revealed the new technology that could make its way into the device. There are mixed feelings about the name for Apple’s 5.8-inch phone, as some say it will be called the ‘iPhone 8’, while others suggest ‘iPhone X’. Regardless, it is said to ‘look something like a smooth black monolith, with few visual interruptions to its sleek design,’ explained Sullivan. The firm is also rumored to be launching two other smartphones along with the iPhone 8 – a 4.7-inch (the iPhone 7s) and a 5.5-inch (the iPhone 7s Plus). Both the 5.5-inch model and the 5.8-inch model are believed to be equipped with the same camera used in the iPhone 7 Plus – the dual-lens camera.    Read more: Here's Why Apple's 10th Anniversary iPhone Will Likely Cost More Than $1,000 | Fast Company | Business + Innovation Apple News on iPhone, iPad and Macbooks | Daily Mail Online Report: iPhone 8 to start mass production in September, featuring Apple-custom ¿built-in¿ fingerprint sensor | 9to5Mac Apple redesigns fingerprint ID solution for OLED iPhone, say sources Share or comment on this article e-mail 16 shares Most watched News videos Leopards attack giant Rock Python in Kruger National Park The Walking Dead: New strain of spice turns homeless into zombies Woman stops car to beat passenger senseless on the road Louis Tomlinson challenges photographer before taking out fan Shocking video shows moment teenager is stabbed in South Norwood Droning on!: Neighbour tries to shoot down spying drone Violent brawl breaks out after man is savagely headbutted to floor Shocking video shows why Coke Zero really is better for you The Manly ferry tackles huge swells over the weekend Dash cam captures close drive-By shooting in Kansas Avalanche crashes down mountain at Russian ski resort Clever dog says 'I love you' to its owner to get treat PIERS MORGAN: Sorry Emma, but you haven’t done yourself...

The post has since been taken down, but initially included the caption: “How did I end up in the studio with Dr Dre ON THE night his deal went public that he did with Apple 3.2 BILLION!!!!! The BEATS HEADPHONES JUST CHANGED HIP HOP!!!!!!” WATCH: The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Financial Times reported the story Thursday citing sources briefed on the talks. Beats by Dre headphones‘ annual sales revenues have reportedly gone up to $1.5 billion since the company was founded with music executive Jimmy Iovine began selling headphones in 2008. The deal would include the new Beats Music streaming service, which Apple is likely acquiring to compete with streaming services like Pandora and Spotify after the company’s iTunes Radio failed to impress the industry. Apple’s revenue growth has declined sharply in recent years, and the company only entered the broadly popular streaming market last year — late because of former CEO Steve Jobs’ reported unfavorable opinion of music subscription services. The company continues to be the largest seller of music downloads, but is losing market share to companies like Amazon. Purchasing Beats would mark Apple’s largest acquisition ever. The headphones retail between about $169.95 to $449.95, depending on model and features, and despite many music and sound industry experts describing their quality as “extraordinarily bad,” the brand has become enormously popular as a fashion item among a younger consumer base, and the popular alternative to standard earbuds models. Beats’ success is due in large part to its wide profit margins – despite the steep prices of the popular bass-heavy headphone models, each individual unit reportedly only costs around $14 to produce. Private equity firm Carlyle Group invested $500 million in Beats last year, and valued the company at more than $1 billion. Neither Apple nor Beats would comment on the deal in the original reports, and the briefed sources said they were still in the negotiation stage. Though the companies have yet to consummate the agreement, and it could still fall through, if things go as planned the official announcement could be made as early as next week.

Share on Twitter Click me! Copy Link Apple is one of the most successful companies in the world and beloved by millions and millions of adoring fans who will wait hours in line to be the first to purchase one of their new iPhones or other devices. But like much of the tech industry, they also have an increasingly obvious problem with gender, racial and cultural diversity that is perhaps most glaring in the company’s leadership. But for the second year in a row, the company’s shareholders rejected a seemingly benign proposal that would task the company with beginning an effort to recruit more diverse members across its senior management and board of directors. In fact, as USA Today reports, shareholders didn’t just reject the proposal, they did so in overwhelming fashion, with 95 percent voting against the proposal from shareholders Tony Maldonado and Zevin Asset Management, which in part would task Apple to “adopt an accelerated recruitment policy ... to increase the diversity of senior management and its board of directors.” Apple’s own numbers paint a bleak picture for diversity proponents. While the company sites marginally improved numbers, the facts remain clear: the company’s overall workforce is 56 percent white, with 9 percent Asians, 12 percent Hispanics and 9 percent African-Americans. However, the company’s senior management reportedly remains overwhelmingly white. For its part, Apple claims their own diversity recruitment policy is actually better than the one offered by Maldonado and Zevin Asset Management. In the shareholding meeting before the vote, Apple CEO Tim Cook reportedly said: "We are focused on human rights and diversity, (and are) advocating for it around the world and increasing it in our own community.” However, Maldonado tells The Verge that he never expected to win the vote. But if the proposal received even 6 percent support, that would meet a baseline allowing him to re-submit it next year. Instead, he says the company openly advocated that its shareholders vote “no,” saying: “Apple basically duped the investors, to be quite honest,” he said. “They conned ’em to say, ‘Look, we're on top of it. Don’t worry about it. Everything’s fine.’ However, I believe that shareholders don’t have all information as to the background of the issue.” Recently on GOOD Stop What You're Doing This Instant And Change All Your Passwords Immediately Do it for your data Culture Andre Grant New Coke Ad Shows A Brother and Sister Fighting Over The Pool Boy It’s a fresh twist on the Diet Coke hunk campaign Communities Tod Perry Four Vietnamese Girls Come Together To Give A Hilarious Response To A Racist Question It’s an unforgettable yearbook quote Communities Tod Perry Is Artificial Turf Toxic?

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India Elections World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Smartphones iPhone 8 release date, features: Late launch expected over delay in mass production Apple is using its Authentec algorithm and Privaris glass identification technology for new fingerprint ID in iPhone 8. Raymond Ronamai   March 4, 2017 00:37 IST AppleReuters Apple has the tradition of releasing its iPhone devices in September, and the current iPhone 7 also arrived in the same month last year, but the launch of the upcoming flagship dubbed as the iPhone 8 is likely to be delayed. The Cupertino giant is using its "Authentec algorithm combined with Privaris glass identification technology to redesign a new fingerprint ID solution" for its new iPhones, and not Synaptics' Natural ID touch fingerprint sensor nor Qualcomm's Sense ID fingerprint technology, industry sources told Digitimes. [READ: Apple's iPhone 8 could feature huge change that fans may not see coming] The report went on to say that the upcoming iPhone 8 will not go into mass production until September, which means its launch could be delayed. Apple usually sells over 10 million units of its flagship in its release week itself, so it may take some time to make so much handset. It won't come as a surprise if the release date of the device is pushed to October. Nothing much is known about Apple's iPhone 8 but a few reports that have been spotted thus far have claimed that the device could be a game-changer for the Cupertino-based company. Reports have claimed that it could sport a 5.8-inch display with an OLED (organic light-emitting diode) screen and come with a wireless charger.

The former positions iPad Pro as a clutter-free alternative to clunky desktop PCs. The latter makes the bold claim that iPad Pro and Apple Pencil “revolutionized the way people take notes,” adding that users can even record voice notes. Watch the new videos, then jump into the comment section to tell us how you liked them. Like prior iPad Pro videos, the new clips are based on real tweets from real people. Here are the new videos. Take better notes Based on a 2012 tweet from Twitter account @jeszka24. “You could take notes in a whole new way, if your computer was an iPad Pro”. We get it, Apple—iPad is the new computer. Need less stuff Based on a 2015 tweet from blogger, designer and photographer Lix Hewett. “Your computer would be more than a computer, if your computer was an iPad Pro,” says the video’s description. Must be fun for these folks to wake up realizing their tweeting has been featured in an Apple commercial. The previous ad has showcased other Apple Pencil features. The remaining clips in Apple’s “Real problems… answered” ad campaign positioned iPad Pro as a viable notebook replacement, focusing on such features and benefits as lack of viruses, availability of Microsoft Office and built-in cellular connectivity. How do you like the new videos? Which one do you prefer over the other, and why?

First it was “the iPad” a simple focused tablet then they screwed the iPad line with the iPad mini and the iPad Air… And again with the iPad pro and the iPad pro mini ( 9,7″ ) and now the upcoming 10.5″ iPad pro mini plus ( hopefully it wouldn’t be called that ). God damn it Apple! More models kill the simplicity that you once were loved for. Blip dude “Just too many options …. And you can’t just go around throwing “pro” at what ever you like.” I don’t think options is the issue, but Apple has yet to convince me how the iPad is a “Pro” device outside of the extra cost for the previlege to use their overpriced pencil and keyboard. How about an iOS design for the iPad first?? You know, an OS that actually unleashes the true power of the iPad. Stuart Lombard I would also have to agree. The average consumer may be turned off by the ‘pro’ monicker. Apple’s audience may be confused about what the device is and isn’t.

According to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the new iPhones will retain the Lightning connector on the device side but make use of USB-C Power Delivery specification for charging. This means the other end of the charging cable is the one that will have a USB-C connector, the one that plugs into the charger. This has two advantages. First, USB-C can carry much more power than standard USB-A. It's the same reason Google provides end-to-end USB-C cables to enable fast charging on its devices (and not just to spite you). Future iPhone chargers will then have a USB-C connector like the new MacBook/MacBook Pro chargers or the Google Pixel charger. Second, the iPhone could then be plugged straight into the company's new MacBooks without the need for an adapter. Sure, you'd then need an adapter for practically every other computer but I'm sure Apple will be happy to sell you an adapter for that. To be clear, this is not new. The 12.9-inch iPad Pro already supports fast charging when you use the optional Apple USB-C to Lightning cable and plug it into one of the Apple 29W, 61W, or 87W USB-C Power Adapter. So far this has been the only iOS device to support fast charging but clearly we are going to see this feature coming to more iOS devices this year. Kuo is a reliable source but again at this point it's still a rumour. However, it seems far, far more likely than Apple putting a USB-C connector on one of its iOS devices. That rumor seemed outlandish to begin with and in the light of this rumor seems even more unlikely.

Vanity Fair hive business technology politics vf summit hwd movies television awards reviews vanities celebrity fashion beauty royals NEWSLETTER Video VF Store Magazine Search Movies TV Awards Reviews HWD Daily What’s Next for the Academy? Email Facebook Twitter SIGN UP FOR NEWSLETTER HWD Daily What’s Next for the Academy? Academy leadership change is on its way, critics love this Kong, and Apple is looking for polished résumés. by Rebecca KeeganMarch 3, 2017 1:38 pm Email Facebook Twitter It’s Friday, and I’m about to embark on a glamour-filled, one-week staycation in the San Fernando Valley. While I’m gone, my colleagues Yohana Desta and Joanna Robinson will be minding the HWD Daily store. Hello from Los Angeles, where we’re eyeballing the Academy’s next steps, checking on who’s taking meetings with Apple, and marveling at Kong’s gorilla-size raves. Sign up to receive Rebecca Keegan’s HWD Daily, Hollywood’s new must-read, in your inbox. THE ACADEMY’S NEXT CHAPTER What a difference a week makes. Last Friday I was sitting in Oscar rehearsals at the Dolby Theatre praying for something interesting to happen on Sunday night’s show. It sure did, and after a week of processing the best-picture envelope snafu, now a major looming question is what happens next for the two people who have lead the Academy through a period of historic transformation, controversy, and growth— the group’s elected president, Cheryl Boone Isaacs, and its C.E.O., Dawn Hudson, who reports to the board of governors. On Thursday, Boone Isaacs sent what Deadline’s Pete Hammond called a “pep talk” email to Academy members, recapping the show’s highlights and promising “changes will be implemented” to address the problems that lead PricewaterhouseCoopers accountant Brian Cullinan to hand Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway the wrong envelope. By Michael Buckner/Variety/Rex/Shutterstock. One big change coming, whether Academy members want it or not, is that Boone Isaacs is winding down her fourth and final term as president this summer. The onetime marketing executive has been a steadying hand in tumultuous times, and, as its first black president and only its third woman, was someone especially well positioned to lead the organization during a diversity debate that she never asked for. This summer, the Academy will have to select a new leader to carry out the ambitious inclusion initiatives the board passed during Boone Isaacs’s tenure, complete the building of the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures scheduled to open in 2018, and navigate the organization’s critical relationship with its broadcast partner, ABC, which has exerted more creative control over the telecast since extending its contract through 2028 last summer. Before Boone Isaacs leaves, in May, the Academy’s 54-member board of governors faces another important leadership decision, when Hudson’s contract comes up for renewal. Hudson, who has overseen the staff of more than 300 people running the Academy’s day-to-day operations since 2011, has been the yang to Boone Isaacs’s yin, prodding dramatic change at the 90-year-old organization, and may continue to do if the board wants her to stay. Whatever the board does regarding Hudson, there’s no question the two women have lead the Academy during one of its most challenging eras, with complementary and occasionally clashing styles. VF.com’s Yohana Desta takes a look at what’s next for the major players in Sunday night’s show. KONG-SIZE PRAISE Who’d a thunk it? It turns out Kong: Skull Island, which Warner Bros. opens stateside March 10, is actually pretty good. Variety chief film critic Owen Gleiberman writes that the action-adventure pic starring Brie Larson and Tom Hiddleston “isn’t just 10 times as good as Jurassic World; it’s a rousing and smartly crafted primordial-beastie spectacular.” The Hollywood Reporter’s Todd McCarthy says director Jordan Vogt-Roberts’s take on the giant primate feels “more like 90 minutes than two hours—and achieves an ideal balance between wild action, throwaway humor, genre refreshment and, perhaps most impressively, a nonchalant awareness of its own modest importance in the bigger scheme of things; unlike most modern franchise blockbusters, it doesn’t try to pummel you into submission.” APPLE’S HOLLYWOOD SHINE Senior Apple execs are taking an awful lot of meetings in Hollywood right now, The New York Post’s Claire Atkinson reports. The Cupertino, California, tech giant has been talking to film and TV producers, made stops at Sony and Paramount, and is “looking for a transformative acquisition,” Atkinson writes. TRAVIS’S NEXT STEP Laika C.E.O. Travis Knight, who directed the Oscar-nominated stop-motion animation film Kubo and the Two Strings, has signed on to helm Bumblebee, the first spinoff of Paramount’s Transformers franchise, Deadline’s Anita Busch reports. The 2018 film will be the first live-action effort for Knight, the son of Nike founder Phil Knight, and will presumably require the Laika exec to find someone to assume some of his duties at his Portland, Oregon, studio. That’s the news for this sunny Friday in L.A. I’ll be back in the saddle Monday, March 13.

As the increase in streaming subscribers continues to push the global recorded music industry to growth it hasn't seen since the last millennium, there has been a slight shift in power from traditional record labels towards digital streamers like Spotify, Apple Music and Amazon. Now, Indian streaming service Saavn -- the subcontinent's version of Spotify, with 20 million monthly active users -- is moving to break down the boundaries between streamers and labels, assuming more of the responsibilities that labels have long provided for their artists. Already, signs of the shift have appeared in the U.S., as Frank Ocean's Blonde and Chance the Rapper's Grammy-winning Coloring Book were released directly through Apple Music without the support of any record label, raising the question of whether Apple would move to expand its operations. So far, the tech giant has demurred from commenting on the possibility, and as Chance and Frank both already enjoyed significant fan bases, there was little risk in investing in things such as artist development on each release. In India, however, Saavn is taking a more explicit approach, introducing an Artist in Residence program last August -- the company released an album by electronic DJ Nucleya and helped route and promote his subsequent tour using its listening data -- as well as a remix initiative shortly thereafter, aiming to give Indian artists on its platform the rights to remix songs by Western artists such as Maroon 5 and OneRepublic, and vice versa. On Feb. 24, Saavn announced a new Artist Originals initiative, having linked with Indian rapper Naezy to release his song "Azaad Hu Mai," becoming the first streamer in India to back a song from inception to distribution without collaborating with a middleman. As the service has grown -- 41 million new users installed its app and listening hours doubled over the past 12 months, according to the company's internal statistics provided to Billboard -- it is beginning to expand its outreach to provide more and more services to local artists bypassing the label system and, more significantly, signing artists to direct deals. "You have a new world of artists that are budding in India, from hip-hop to singer-songwriters," says Rishi Malhotra, Saavn's co-founder and CEO. "Because we have the scale we do, we're starting to blur the lines between a streaming service and a label. Our goal is to be the most creative place for artists to do what they love." Part of Saavn's success in the space comes from the particulars of the local Indian music industry, which has traditionally been tied to Bollywood and the film world, and encompasses some 900 distinct labels that have resisted the consolidation that the U.S. has seen. Saavn's growth has coincided with both a rise in independent underground artists with no ties to the film world, producing a creative class without a traditional support system -- which created the gap for Saavn to fill. "If in the U.S. the way artists got promotion and distribution was through mixtapes and radio, in India that has always been film," Malhotra says. "And I think what you've seen in the last 12 to 24 months is the massive disruption of that, due just to the market... In the last year, film music was 85 percent of total streams; now it's 65 percent." Malhotra chalks that up to several reasons: the generational shift towards mobile and away from traditional television and film; the internet's ability to break down traditional borders, leading to a rise in English language music -- Drake, Sia, the Chainsmokers -- streaming in India; the steady rise in internet access across the subcontinent; and what he calls India's "connectivity tipping point," which he compares to AT&T's introduction of unlimited data plans nearly a decade ago and its subsequent boon for streaming services like Pandora in the U.S. "In September 2016, [telecom company] Reliance Jio opened up unlimited data, and since then you're just seeing a boon in terms of connectivity and engagement," Malhotra says. "Whereas we used to do 500 million streams in a quarter, now we do 500 million streams in a month, easily, and that's just in the last six or seven months." Saavn's potential attracted interest from key players early on such as Guy Oseary, who manages Madonna and U2 and runs Maverick Management, who invested in the company through his investment firm, Sound. "I finally was able to do almost two things at once: which is back the best streaming service with the best people involved in India, but also now have a real relationship with India for the first time," Oseary says. "So after, you know, 25 years in the music business, I can finally say to Madonna or any of the clients that we work with, if you want to do something musically with India we have the partner to do it with." Oseary has been a key part of Saavn's moves further into the label space, connecting his artists with the service's remix initiative, for example. "I’m patient," he says about Saavn's prospects on a broader scale. "I don’t know if the word is explode, but I know I’m going to get to the same place regardless. I believe that this company will be the streaming service of India." With its original music programs, Saavn also distributes its artists' work beyond just its own streaming service, working songs to radio and releasing them widely to other digital outlets as well -- an approach that seems counter-intuitive for a company that would otherwise be able to directly control all aspects of its distribution. But Malhotra doesn't see long-term value for artists in maintaining exclusivity. "We believe in distribution, and it's not just about us containing the song to Saavn's user base," he says. "If you do exclusivity in perpetuity, it increases piracy and it really holds back the reason for actually doing this: the music should be heard." Will Saavn's 360-degree approach catch on Stateside? Apple Music, Spotify and Tidal have all made strides into original content, but it has largely centered around films, documentaries or new television series, like Apple's Carpool Karaoke show. But there have been small-scale steps in that direction; Spotify, for instance, introduced a singles series in November where artists such as John Legend, D.R.A.M. and Tove Lo record an original song of their own and a cover song in Spotify's in-house studio, as well as a live performance initiative that it will host on its platform. But so far, the major players in the Western streaming world have resisted moving in on the labels' territory. Saavn, clearly, does not have the same reservations. "Labels are our core partners, and they always will be, and I think that's true of any music streaming service," Malhotra says. "But I think music isn't only about libraries, it's truly about moving people. [India is] a country that has been heavily pirated over the last 20 years, and now Saavn has become a legitimate platform for labels, artists and users. So this coming year is about two things: growth and delivering a sustainable economic model for this country. And I believe we're delivering in both cases."

Windows 10 Mobile not widely used. Bottom Line Windows 10 delivers a host of new technology that makes interacting with your PC more natural than ever. The improved interface, security, Edge Web browser, and other apps and features make Windows 10 worthy of our Editors' Choice award. By Michael Muchmore Windows 10 holds the lead in innovation when it comes to desktop operating systems. Consider, for example, that the voice-activated digital assistant Cortana showed up a full year before Apple added Siri to macOS, that only Windows Hello lets you log in with your face, and that only Windows offers full touch-screen support. What's more, last summer's Anniversary Update added rich digital-inking capabilities, lock-screen Cortana and music controls, better security, and improvements to the interface and Edge web browser. Yet even with all its forward-looking features, the OS manages to remain familiar to longtime Windows users. For this, Windows 10 joins macOS as a PCMag Editors' Choice for desktop operating systems. //Compare Similar Products Compare Apple macOS Sierra   %displayPrice%%seller% Microsoft Windows 8.1 Update   %displayPrice%%seller% Microsoft Windows 7   %displayPrice%%seller% Ubuntu 12.04 ("Precise Pangolin")   %displayPrice%%seller% Microsoft's latest operating system is a much bigger hit than its ill-fated predecessor, Windows 8. In the year and a half since launch, Windows 10 has attained a 25 percent desktop operating system share, with more than 400 million copies installed—a faster adoption rate than any previous version of Windows. By comparison, all versions of Apple's operating system account for just 7 percent of worldwide computers, according to data from NetMarketShare. Microsoft bills the operating system as a "service," meaning it's continually updated via the cloud. A case in point is last summer's Anniversary Update, which added impressive new features like digital ink support, as well as some helpful design improvements, many of which were prompted by the vast amounts of user feedback Microsoft has collected. In October the company announced that the Windows 10 Creators Update would arrive in "early 2017." This will add a 3D-capable version of Paint (more on that below), and game broadcasting. More productivity, creativity, security and gaming features are on the way, too, according to Microsoft. The previously announced My People unified communication feature announced for Creators Update has been postponed to the next major update. In between those major updates, Windows 10 users have received a completely updated version of the Photos app, new Cortana capabilities, and new features in the built-in Maps app. The most recent feature news between major updates comes in the Windows Mail and Calendar apps. Below, you'll find more on all of these. View All 25 Photos in Gallery How to Get Windows 10 If you didn't move up from Windows 7 or 8 during the year it was free, you can still get Windows 10, but you have to pay for it. You can get the software via download or on USB sticks for the same prices as previous Windows versions; that is, $119.99 list for Home and $199.99 for Pro. Your data and programs come along for the ride when you update from previous versions, though it's always a good idea to back up before an OS upgrade. Windows 10's minimum system requirements are surprisingly low: a 1GHz processor, 1GB of RAM, and 16GB of hard drive space. The 64-bit version of Windows 10 increases the RAM requirement to 2GB and the disk space to 20GB. You'll also need a DirectX 9-capable graphics card and a display with at least 800-by-600 resolution. You can find out whether your system is up to snuff by reading Can My PC Run Windows 10? Windows 10 is available to most users in just two editions: Home and Pro (with 32-bit and 64-bit options for each), but all of the major features appear in both versions. Pro adds business-y things like network domain joining, Hyper-V virtualization, group policy management, and BitLocker encryption. That last one may be of interest to security-conscious personal users, too. Unsurprisingly, if you upgrade from Home levels of Windows 7 or 8, you get Windows 10 Home, and if you update from the professional versions of 7 or 8, you get Pro. There are, of course, other editions of Windows 10 for special use cases: Enterprise is still an option for large organizations that want bulk licensing deals. Anniversary Update introduced two new Education versions for K-12 institutions: Windows 10 Pro Education and Windows 10 Education. Neither includes Cortana, for now. And let's not forget the lightweight edition that powers Internet-of-things devices and the Raspberry Pi: Windows 10 IoT Core. Windows 10 presents almost no learning curve for longtime Windows users, while managing to incorporate many of the advances of Windows 8—faster startup, tablet capability, better notifications, and an app store. Its windowing prowess remains unmatched, letting you easily show the desktop and snap windows to the sides and corner quadrants of the screen. The newest Windows still runs the vast majority of the millions of Windows programs in the wild. Yes, that means it still uses the much-derided Registry to maintain configuration settings, but on today's fast hardware that no longer presents issues. (Microsoft recommends against using any third-party registry-optimizing software for Windows 10.) When setting up a Windows 10 account, you can log in to a local account, without the need for a Microsoft account (macOS, by comparison, requires an Apple account), but you'll lose many of the OS's best features if you do so. A lot of critics have nevertheless called out Microsoft for harvesting usage data by default, so if you're the paranoid type, you shouldn't set up the PC using Express Settings, which enable anonymous usage data collection. For details, read Windows 10: How to Protect Your Privacy. Interface Aside from the improvements to headliner features, such as Cortana, Hello, and Ink, the Anniversary Update makes some subtle, but useful, improvements to the desktop interface. For example, the Start menu has been updated: Now it shows the All Apps list without a second button press, and it also shows most used and newly installed apps. I've often found clicking the date in the Taskbar useful, since it pops up a calendar; now you can also see your appointments in that view. Live tiles have also been updated in a way that makes more sense than before. Now, when you click on a live tile, you'll go to the content highlighted there, rather than just to the app. For example, you'll go directly to the news story or the email or the photo showing on the live tile. The Windows Store also gets another redesign, this time with features designed to appeal to gamers, in particular. It's aligned more closely with the Xbox Store, and it now offers game bundles and subscriptions. For everyone else, the new design does make it a bit easier to get to the top apps, music, and movies. The Store's download progress indicator is now bigger and clearer, too. One other tweak is that the Action Center (see below) icon now is all the way at the right of the Taskbar, making it easier reach. And one final new interface option, Dark mode, shows apps with black window backgrounds, which can be gentler on the eyes—as well as just looking cool. Another interface feature I've really started to cherish is File Explorer's Quick Access section. This lets you easily find whatever file you were last working on in whatever application you were using. So, if you edit an image and want to add it to another app, it's right at the top of the Quick Access list. You never have to remember where you just saved a file to find it. Overlap between the Settings App and Control Panel still remains an interface legacy of Windows 8, but really, it's no longer such an issue. For simple system settings, you use the Settings app, for deep, technical system options, you go to the Control Panel. Cortana Tricks Cortana, Windows' voice-responsive AI digital assistant, may be Windows 10's highest-profile feature. The intelligent voice assistant predates Apple's Siri on the Mac by over a year. I should note that you can no longer completely disable Cortana in the Update, but you can prevent her from accessing your location, email, contacts, and browsing history, and communications. You can also turn off her listening for "Hey Cortana." Cortana is, however, the search function in the OS, but you can hide the search bar if you never want to use it. You can now use Cortana from the lock screen. This is useful for things like playing a particular music playlist, asking about today's weather, or asking for information. Speaking of music, the Cortana panel now has a musical note button that serves a Shazam-like function to identify songs in range of your PC's mic. Intel also has new wake-on-voice technology that means you could say "Hey Cortana!" and have the PC respond even if it's in sleep mode. It's sort of like an Amazon Echo, without the need for a separate device. Cortana Notebook, which is where you specify your interests so that you'll be notified about what matters to you, has added a few more categories, including On the Go, which pops up suggestions for when you arrive at work or home. Unlike Siri or Google Now, with Cortana, you specify exactly what the assistant knows about you—interests, important people, locations—and you choose whether to have her respond to your spoken "Hey Cortana," or whether you want to use the feature at all. One improvement to Cortana Reminders is the removal of the Place, Person, or Time requirement: Sometimes you just want to be reminded of something without having to specify any of those. With the previous version, I sometimes tried to set a reminder but gave up because I didn't have a time or place in mind. This simple tweak makes the tool a whole lot more useful. Cortana Reminders is now a share target; when you hit the share button in a Universal Windows App (UWA), you can set a reminder that's richer than before. For example, if you're in the Edge Web browser, you can hit the Share button, choose Cortana Reminders, and attach the site URL to the reminder. If you do this from the Photos app, the picture is included in the reminder. A recent Cortana reminder feature can scan your Outlook.com or Office 365 email for phrases like "I'll get you the report by the end of the day," and pop a reminder automatically at the end of your workday. It's a completely opt-in feature, and you have to add Outlook.com or Office 365 as a connected service in Cortana's Notebook. Cortana in Windows 10 now interacts more tightly with Cortana apps on other devices, such as Android phones and iPhones. You can enable notifications from the phone, including things like low-battery warnings, to show up on Cortana on Windows. You also see messages from WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and SMS from the phone. With all of these improvements, Windows 10 is edging towards the tight integration between mobile and desktop that you find in macOS, though it still doesn't let you reply, except to Skype messages. The integration also works more fully with Android devices than with iOS devices, since the latter restrict access to some system capabilities. Of course, it works best with phones running Windows 10 Mobile, but while they're still available, and even with new models like the HP Elite x3 coming out, the platform has failed to make significant inroads into the smartphone market. Windows Ink Touch and pen input support is a major differentiator between Windows 10 and Apple's macOS. Apple sticks with Steve Job's edict that touch screens don't make sense on laptops and desktops. But a touch screen is the most intuitive interface type possible. You see something you want to interact with, such as a button, you press it with your finger. In using a Surface Pro 4 and an Asus Zen AiO Pro Z240IC all-in-one PC (both of which have touch screens) for the past year or so, I've gotten to the point of trying to tap buttons on computers with non-touch screens out of habit. Windows' digital ink capabilities allow stylus input to work just like a pen or pencil, converting it to text. This is a technologically cool feature, but it will only be of interest to owners of tablets and convertibles like the Surface Pro 4, the Surface Book or the Lenovo IdeaPad Miix 700. The new Windows Ink Workspace offers sticky notes (with extra smarts), as well as Sketchpad and Screen Sketch options. It also shows recent apps you've penned in and suggests pen-friendly apps in the Store. You can turn off the feature's icon if you don't expect to use it. This new Ink Workspace can be summoned by clicking a stylus button. You can also take advantage of some Cortana smarts in the new sticky notes. For example, if you write "Wednesday," the text is turned to a blue link, and clicking this gives you the option to set a Cortana reminder. I actually had better luck getting Cortana to notice flight information when I typed it in the note, rather than penning it, however. Info on flight status for such notes appears at the bottom of the sticky. Sketchpad offers ballpoint pen, pencil, highlighter, eraser, ruler, and touch writing tools. Sketchpad resembles the whiteboard app on the Surface Hub. It also lets you crop the image, copy it, and share it to any Universal Windows app in the share sidebar. A ruler tool lets you draw perfectly straight lines, and even includes a compass. Double-clicking the pen button or choosing Screen Sketch from the Ink Workspace snaps a screenshot of your desktop and opens it in Sketchpad so you can annotate and draw on top of it with any of the aforementioned tools. One of the coolest inking capabilities is the pen keyboard. You switch to this mode from the standard on-screen keyboard. Start writing on the line there, and text predictions show up. Hit enter, and your writing turns into text in whatever text area you're writing in. It does surprisingly well with even poor penmanship, and striking through your writing deletes it easily. Edge Web Browser Gets More Capable The Edge Web browser that comes with Windows 10 is fast and compatible, and it offers unique tools like Web Notes that let you mark up and share webpages, a clean (ad-free) Reading view, and built-in Cortana information. Until now, however, it has lacked a feature that power users insist on: Extensions. Edge's new Extensions menu option links to the Windows app store, from which you can finally get Edge extensions. I tested by installing one I consider essential—LastPass. There are also extensions for Amazon, Evernote, Microsoft Translator, OneNote, Pinterest, Pocket, and others. Though it's not a long list yet, those are some heavy hitters that will make the browser appealing to more demanding users. Of course, it's just a start, and there are only 23 extensions at time of writing, compared with thousands for Firefox and Chrome. Microsoft representatives told me that the reason for this is that the Edge team is being very careful in vetting extensions, not wanting another ActiveX-type security nightmare. They're also still building out the API; we should see a lot more extensions when Creators Update rolls out. Coding for IE's extensions uses the same Web technologies as Chrome does (HTML and JavaScript), however, and Microsoft says converting existing Chrome extensions will be trivial. In fact, the W3C is coming out with a Browser Extension standard, which Microsoft aims to support. After downloading the LastPass extension in the store, I hit the Launch button on its store page, and then saw a message in the top-right corner of the browser notifying me that a new extension was available and offering to turn it on. I then had to log in to my LastPass account on a webpage. (I also use Duo Mobile for two-factor authentication, which I allowed from my iPhone). Unlike most browsers' extensions, Edge's appear by default in the overflow menu rather than next to the address bar, but you can add their icons to the toolbar with a Settings option. The LastPass extension worked just as in other browsers. LastPass's on-page features, such as automatic password fill-in, also worked well via the extension. Edge now gets 460 out of a possible 555 points in my testing on the HTML5Test.com site, making it highly compatible with modern Web standards compared with IE, which scores 312. Firefox, by comparison, gets 466, Opera comes in at 504, and Chrome still leads with 507. Edge's low battery drain on portable PCs and tablets, is another feather it its cap (see my review linked below). I also did a quick speed test using the JetStream benchmark on a Surface Book with an Intel Core i5 and 8GB RAM. The benchmark runs three times through a bank of 38 tests. Bigger scores are better. Firefox got a score of 142, Chrome achieved 168, and Edge came in at 196. That's not so surprising: Earlier Edge versions even beat Chrome on Google's own Octane benchmark. Tablet and touch-screen users will like Edge's new swipe gestures, which let you go back and forth in history, and desktop users will appreciate that the back button now drops down tab history, as most browsers do. I also appreciate that Edge, like other browsers, now offers a Paste-and-go option and the ability to pin tabs. Unfortunately, there's still no full-screen browser view and you can't set an image as your desktop background from the browser. For an in-depth look, read my full review of Microsoft Edge. Windows Hello and Improved Security One focus of the Anniversary Update is security, including Windows Hello biometric authentication. Hello is not only supported on Surface Pros and Books, but you can also use third-party biometric login devices, such as the Eidon Mini fingerprint reader, Intel's RealSense cameras, and a wristband from Nymi that identifies you by your unique heartbeat signature. And on the software side, Windows Universal Apps and websites you browse in Edge can also use Hello for authentication, similar to identifying yourself on an iPhone or Apple Watch with Apple's TouchID. Apps that support Hello now include Dropbox and iHeartRadio. In more security news, the included anti-malware software, Windows Defender, adds the ability to schedule regular system scans and new notifications about threats. Enterprise security feature adds include two major new features: Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection, which detects and resolves advanced network threats; and Windows Information Protection, which isolates corporate data from personal data on work PCs. Though our security expert, Neil Rubenking, found the pre-Anniversary version of Defender showed some improved scores on independent lab tests, it still trails most third-party antivirus. Action Center A Windows 10 feature with roots in mobile operating systems is the Action Center. While previous versions of Windows included something also called Action Center, the new feature is more like a smartphone's notifications plus quick action features. In fact, that's exactly what it is. Windows 8 had notifications, but they were ephemeral—if you missed one, whether it was a Facebook message or a severe weather alert, it was gone after a brief appearance. The Windows 10 Action Center, similar to Apple macOS Sierra's Notification Center, keeps those messages available in a right-side panel. You open Windows 10's Action Center panel from a taskbar button, or on touch screens with a swipe in from the right edge of the screen. The panel also offers frequently needed functions like power, settings, networking, and screen brightness and rotation. One of these actions, Connect, is pretty neat, in that it lets you project your screen onto another one on your network. I was able to display my Surface Pro 3's screen on a big Samsung TV with no setup aside from choosing OK on the TV—pretty nifty. Store and Universal Windows Apps If you never upgraded to Windows 8 or 8.1, you don't know what it is to have an app store on your PC desktop. Why do you need an app store on your PC? Mac users have had one for several years, and it offers the advantages of automatic updating and a single source for finding programs you need. It gives you access on all your PCs (and Windows Phones) to apps you've bought. Acceptance to the Windows Store also means an app has been vetted by Microsoft for security. You can also install apps to external memory—something tablet users will appreciate. For Windows 10, there are even more advantages for these modern apps: They can tie in with the notifications and share panels. For example, if you use the Facebook app rather than going to the Facebook website, you can see notifications for new messages and you can send shareable content via the app. Windows 10 Store apps are called Universal Windows apps, meaning they can run on desktops, tablets, phones, the Surface Hub, and eventually on the Xbox and Microsoft HoloLens reality-augmentation 3D headset. Underneath these apps is Windows 10's OneCore platform, a common base that underlies all these device types and allows not only apps, but also device drivers to work with them. UWAs have one more benefit: They run within containers so that they don't mess with the rest of your system. Continuum and Tablet Mode Continuum refers to switching among desktop, smartphone, and tablet modes. The idea is that the single OS can automatically reformat itself to work best with the form factor at hand. It's most impressive on smartphones, where Continuum lets you use the small handheld device to power a large screen along with a mouse and keyboard, for a desktop-like experience. That's been the idea of the future for several years: A world in which your only computer fits in your pocket. You can either use the Microsoft Display Dock for this or connect over Wi-Fi using a Miracast-supporting HDTV or set-top box. It's brilliantly done, and pretty impressive when you first see it. The phone turns into a trackpad and keyboard when needed, yet you can still use it as a phone while it's displaying Windows on the big screen. One drawback: Continuum only allows the phone to display one full-size modern Store app (including Office apps) at a time. Another issue is that it only works with the latest Windows Phone models, such as the Lumia 950. Tablet mode is no longer considered a Continuum feature, but is simply referred to as Tablet mode. This is a trimmed down, more touch-friendly version of the OS, with a full-screen tile-based Start screen. After you pull off the keyboard from a tablet, such as the Surface Pro 4, or convert a convertible laptop to tablet mode (often by bending the screen backwards), Windows pops up a message asking if you want to switch to Tablet mode, in which the Start menu and modern apps become full screen. Touch gestures like closing an app by swiping down from the top of the screen work in this mode. For Anniversary, the All Apps view stretches across the screen with large tiles, making it easier to get to any app on the PC. Continuum and tablet mode should not be confused with Apple's Continuity, which is all about switching from one device to another while continuing an activity, whether you are sending an SMS text or editing a document. Windows 10 actually does have an option for using Bluetooth to continue app experiences from one device to another, however. Included Apps—Office Mobile, Mail, Calendar, Photos You get a surprisingly full kit of apps with Windows 10. Not only do you get the modern information apps that came with Windows 8—Maps, Money, News, Sports, Food & Drink, Health & Fitness, and so on—but you also can get Microsoft Office from the Windows app store. You heard that right, but there's a catch: Unless you have an Office 365 subscription, you can only read, not edit, documents with these productivity apps. The version of Office you get with Windows 10 is equivalent to the iPad version of Office, called Office Mobile. It's capable of most word processing, spreadsheet, and presentation needs, but pros who need to dig into Excel pivot tables and Word advanced formatting will want the Office 365 version. The included Mail app (which is called Outlook on the mobile version of Windows 10) is getting smarter too, with Focused Inbox rolling out even before Creators Update. This is a great feature that's already implemented in the Outlook for iPhone and Android apps. It filters out all the newsletters and promotions, and only shows you mail from those with whom you regularly correspond, or that is=s in some other way deemed important by the service. You can of course still see everything else at the tap of a tab, and turn off this focusing for mail you don't want highlighted. You can now also use @ signs in an email body to add them to the conversation. Still, the app isn't as powerful as the Office 365 desktop version, though I must admit that it's now good enough to be my everyday work email client. The Mail app is integrated with Calendar and Contact apps, available from buttons along the bottom of Mail. Calendar does a presentable job of handling multiple calendars, appointments, and views. Recent additions to the Calendar include color-coding for event categories, public calendar subscriptions for shows and sports, and cards for deliveries and travel reservations. The cards for travel reservations even include links to online check-in services. In addition to the Office apps, you get the Groove Music app, which you can use either to simply play music sitting on your hard drive or in your OneDrive cloud storage or with its paid ($9.99 per month) ad-free, on-demand streaming service. The latter offers a huge library, though it has limitations compared with the Mac's iTunes and Apple Music. Another included app is Movies & TV, which also offers a content store as well as the ability to play your own videos. You still get lots of utility-type apps, too, including a scanner app, alarms, a calculator, a camera, a reader (for viewing PDFs and several other document formats), and a voice recorder. There's even a Phone Companion app that works with iOS and Android mobiles as well as with Windows phones. The impressive Maps app recently has been updated with support for Windows Ink, meaning you can mark up a map using a stylus or your finger on a touch-screen PC. But that's not all: You can calculate the distance of a line you draw on a map and get directions for two points you tap. If you don't have a touch screen, the same functionality is possible with a mouse. You can also use a virtual on-screen ruler to make your lines straight. Of special note is the updated Photos app, which lets you organize your photos into albums, apply fixes like red-eye correction, lighting, and color, and effects like selective focus and Instagram-like filters. The app has recently been updated with a completely new interface that uses slider bars instead of wheels, adds more filters, and gives the ability to draw on photos. Photos even creates automatic galleries for you based on photos taken at a similar time and place, picking the best of similar photos to include. But again, at this point in its evolution, it still slightly trails the macOS counterpart, Photos, which adds face recognition. And an entry-level video-editing app like the old Windows Movie Maker or Apple's iMovie is completely AWOL from Windows 10. Though the reappearance of a video editing is a matter of speculation, we have heard about an old standby, Paint, taking on forward-looking new 3D capabilities. See my preview of Paint 3D, which will launch next spring in the Creators Update. Not only does it let you create, customize, and decorate 3D objects, but you can also share them with the Remix3D.com online community. OneDrive and Skype Two of Microsoft's cloud services—OneDrive for online storage and syncing and for communication—will play an increasingly important role in Windows 10. There's an important distinction between these and Apple's analogous iCloud for macOS: They can be used on any platform. So there are Skype and OneDrive apps for Macs, Androids, and iOS devices, as well as for PCs and Windows phones. While OneDrive does a great job syncing Office documents and personalization settings, and Skype is a very rich communication tool, there's still some work for Microsoft to do in integrating them with Windows 10. For example, when using the Photos app, you can tap the Share icon to send selected images to Mail, Facebook, Twitter, or any other app that accepts sharing of that file type—but not to OneDrive. Skype integration in Windows 10 is also somewhat in flux. In fact, the service's Universal Windows App is still called Skype Preview, which now supports chat bots. Windows has the potential for parity to macOS's Messaging and Facetime apps, but it's not there yet. The Action Center now shows Skype messages, but still not missed calls. You can now directly reply to messages inside the panel just as on the Mac. The Mac solution here is still more seamless, but Windows 10 is getting closer. Also keep in mind that Skype is a full, standalone VoIP solution that can call standard phones, while the Mac is just hooking into the iPhone's mobile connection. And like OneDrive, Skype works on all major platforms, not just one. Gaming Microsoft continues to make the Window 10 proposition sweeter for gamers. The Xbox app for Windows 10 not only lets them see an activity feed, but it also includes game DVR and can even stream games from an Xbox One to the PC. PCMag's game maven Jeff Wilson has taken a good look at Windows 10's Xbox gaming app. While he found that game streaming and the DVR feature worked well, he was less impressed with the game selection—it can't compete with Steam's. He was also disappointed that you can't buy games right from the app, but instead have to switch to the Windows Store app. He also found the interface somewhat cluttered. On the plus side, the Xbox and Windows 10 Stores have been unified, and the Play Anywhere initiative means you can buy games for one platform and play them either on the console or the PC. Game progress stays in sync between platforms. Play Anywhere games have begun to appear, but the list is still quite short: At the moment, only three full-fledged games are Play Anywhere-compatible—Gears of War 4, Forza Horizon 3, and ReCore—but about a dozen more are available in preview form. You can keep up with the list on the Xbox Play Anywhere page. Beyond the Xbox app, Windows 10's 3D video engine is now DirectX 12, which, according to some game developers, could open up a whole new level of realism to games. And Windows 10 was recently enhanced with the ability to turn off VSync and instead enable AMD's Freesync and Nvidia's G-Sync in Universal Windows Platform (UWP) games and apps. The same update also unlocked frame rates for UWP games. Microsoft's own Gears of War: UE game will soon be updated with those features, as will Forza Motorsport 6: Apex (free). You can read more about what Freesync, G-Sync and unlocked frame rates mean for Windows 10 on our sister site, Extreme Tech. All of this adds up to one more reason it's never been a better time to be a PC gamer. If you have doubts about that, you should check out all the first-rate titles in our Best PC Games of 2016 feature. The Creators Update will add built-in game broadcasting capability and will also let users create their own Arena gamer tournaments on Xbox Live. Windows of Opportunity Windows 10 Anniversary Update offers more ways to interact with your desktop PC than any competitor, along with more third-party hardware and software options. Whether it's using your voice with Cortana, gesturing on a touch screen, or writing with a digital pen, Windows is the OS of choices. It's the platform that offers the most choice in form factor, from the smallest tablets to massive gaming PCs and the giant Surface Hub. Its only device-based weakness is the flagging Windows Phone ecosystem, despite impressive new Windows phone models, such as the Alcatel Idol 4S occasionally showing up, and Microsoft's rumored Surface Phone). Windows is a desktop and tablet operating system that's familiar, innovative, and adaptable to the size and capabilities of the hardware on which it's running. For managing to include so much new technology, while remaining intuitive to use, Windows 10 earns a PCMag Editors' Choice for desktop operating systems, an honor it shares with the polished and impressive macOS.

Terrific interface is now brighter, more welcoming. Numerous audio editing and mixing workflow improvements. Rock-solid stable on two test systems. No copy protection, unlike many of its competitors. Excellent value. Cons Some plug-ins still need a UI makeover. Bottom Line Apple Logic Pro X 10.3 is a powerful update to an already-excellent digital audio workstation, and if you own Logic Pro X, it's free. By Jamie Lendino For post-production, film and video game composers, and home-studio musicians alike, Logic Pro X ($199.99) continues to set the bar for pro-level audio editing at a bargain price. The latest upgrade, to version 10.3, contains another round of useful upgrades, and the update is free to existing Pro X owners. The package puts even more pressure on its well-established digital audio workstation, or DAW, competitors, many of which have moved to subscription-based pricing that make them more expensive to buy and maintain over the long term. Unless you need Avid Pro Tools for compatibility with other studios, or simply because you're more familiar with it, Logic Pro remains our favorite mainstream DAW and a clear Editors' Choice. //Compare Similar Products Compare Avid Pro Tools 11   %displayPrice%%seller% Steinberg Cubase 7   %displayPrice%%seller% MOTU Digital Performer 8 (for Mac)   %displayPrice%%seller% Cakewalk SONAR X3 Producer   %displayPrice%%seller% Apple GarageBand 10 (for Mac)   %displayPrice%%seller% Setup, Installation, and User Interface To get started with Logic Pro X 10.3, you'll need a recent Mac running OS X v10.11 (El Capitan) or later, with at least 4GB RAM and 6GB of free space for the base program. To install everything, including all of the packaged synths, instruments, loops, and effects, you'll need 57GB free. As always, Logic Pro X doesn't require hardware or software copy protection; as long as you're logged into the Apple Store with your account, you can download, install, and run it seamlessly. For this review, I tested Logic Pro X 10.3 on two machines: a 2013 MacBook Air with the Core i7 upgrade, a 256GB SSD, and 8GB RAM running macOS Sierra 10.12.2; and a quad-core i7 2012 Mac Mini with 16GB RAM and a 256GB SSD running OS X El Capitan 10.11.6. I tested Logic Pro X 10.3 with both a Focusrite Scarlett 18i8 audio interface and each Mac's built-in audio, and as expected, I ran into no problems. In fact, I didn't run into any bugs at all; this may be the most stable version of Logic Pro X I've tested in years. View All 10 Photos in Gallery Apple heavily redesigned the interface for the Pro X launch back in 2013; most of the improvements were welcome, but the color scheme wasn't. It took on a much darker tone that works well for video editing in a dark room, but not necessarily for audio editing. Apple has lightened things up a bit this time around. It's still not as silvery-bright as Logic Pro 9 was. More significantly, the UI elements and fonts have received a flatter, macOS Sierra-like makeover, with a simpler, cleaner design that's easier on the eyes. The transport numerals get a thinner, sharper font as well. The UI itself remains almost entirely the same, so there's nothing new to learn; it's just a bit cleaner and more attractive throughout. Despite its immense power, Logic remains a simple program to start using, because the main screen can include everything you need from start to finish—depending on how you populate it, of course. Basic tracks are available in several kinds: audio, for recording live instruments; MIDI, for recording MIDI data from a keyboard, electronic drum set, or other input device; and instrument, which combine the two for use with virtual synthesizers and other plug-in instruments. The main view doesn't see much change in 10.3. The transport is located at the top of the screen and away from any keyboards, mixing surfaces, or other things you may have sitting at the bottom of the monitor and blocking part of the view. The Library contains all available media content; it's on the left and easily collapsible. The top right portion of the screen contains the arrange window, which is where you do most of your composing and editing. Each track in the arrange window has volume and pan controls. Below that is a multi-mode window that can display the mixer, a piano roll, a score editor, or a sample editor. To the left, a track inspector window shows the mixer channel strip for the individual track, plus the track's output bus—be it the master stereo or 5.1 surround bus, or an aux. The right side pops up a number of windows that cover the tempo and time signature of your project, as well as the current MIDI track's event list, which when combined with the piano roll or score editor, makes it simple to edit your tracks. The score editor still isn't quite as capable as Finale, but it certainly does the job for songwriters or orchestral arranging in a pinch. Touch Bar and Track Alternatives Some of the biggest news with the 10.3 update is full-fledged support for the Touch Bar on the newest MacBook Pro lineup introduced in October 2016. It can show a timeline view with appropriate region colors, track controls, Smart Controls on a track-by-track or even plug-in basis (such as compressor or EQ controls, or electric piano distortion). Tap on a knob, and you can slide a fader right or left to change its value, which makes sense given the thinness of the Touch Bar; you wouldn't want to try and actually tweak a knob that small in a circular manner. In addition, the Touch Bar supports hundreds of keyboard shortcuts, including customized sets, and you can use the Touch Bar to perform with small drum pads, piano keyboard scales, or even map MIDI continuous controllers to a slider for third-party plug-ins that use the mod wheel for expression, like Garritan Personal Orchestra or Spectrasonics Omnisphere. The Touch Bar enhancements are admittedly tempting enough to consider upgrading to one of the latest MacBook Pros, and along with Logic Remote on an iPad, could further reduce the need for an expensive hardware transport and mixing controller. Editing and comping tracks gets a boost thanks to a new Track Alternatives feature, which is similar to a Pro Tools Playlist. It does what it says on the tin; it lets you create alternative versions of a track and then audition and switch between edits, takes, or regions. It's in addition to Take Folders, and as such offers more flexibility when comping a lead vocal or a guitar solo. You can also destructively render selections of a region now; say you've found a combination of effects you like, and know you want to keep it; you can print it right away, just for that region, and then get back to work. Recording and Virtual Instruments Apple hasn't changed Logic Pro X's built-in sound set much in 10.3, but with a few exceptions, you could argue it didn't need to. There are over 2,700 instrument and effect patches, including 750 sampled instruments, plus 5,600 downloadable loops. Most of the instruments are contained in a neat Library drawer that pack the instrument plug-in and separate effects already set up, which makes laying down new tracks a cinch. But for our purposes, let's drill down to the actual plug-ins available. EXS24 continues to be the workhorse sampler it has been for over a decade, and provides the core workstation-style sample set, including drum kits and pianos. Logic's venerable E-series plug-ins (such as ES1, ES2, ES P, the EVP88 electric piano and so on) provide plenty of synthesizer and keyboard sounds, although many of these sound a bit thin when stacked against today's top plug-ins. That doesn't matter, because you also get Retro Synth, which provides fat-sounding imitations of subtractive, FM, and wavetable-based based vintage synths, and you can even drag any waveform into the wavetable module; the plug-in will automatically look for pitched information and transform it into a playable virtual instrument. You can stack up to eight voices—and you thought your Roland JUNO-106's Unison mode sounded thick! The star of the show is now Alchemy, a full-blown additive, spectral, and granular synthesizer originally from Camel Audio that Apple added back in the Logic Pro X 10.2 release. I've been meaning to buy a copy of that synth for years to begin with; it used to cost several hundred dollars. Apple redesigned the interface, reworked the filters for a fatter analog-type sound, and added support for importing EXS24 instruments. Finally, a separate vintage keyboard and organ collection includes such niceties as B3-style drawbars, a vastly configurable Leslie simulator, and a suitcase-style electric piano. There are also plenty of guitar and bass amp simulators and effects included as well. I've always been a fan of third-party drum plug-ins like Superior Drummer and EZdrummer, but it's tough to argue with the one built into Logic Pro X. Drummer is an artificially intelligent session player—one of 28, each with different styles, personalities, and drum kits for a distinctive groove. You can adjust the frequency of fills, whether they're using the toms or hi-hats more in a given section, and even the frequency of ghost notes and whether they're rushing the beat (a la Stewart Copeland) or relaxing the groove (a la John Bonham). Drummer can follow other tracks for inspiration; for example, the bass player can set the groove for a performance, and Drummer will take cues from the bass track to figure out where to lock in the kick drum. You don't have to use Drummer for auto-generated grooves, though; if you're like me, you'll want to program your own grooves. And for that, it sounds great. The Producer Kits include excellent-sounding, multi-channel mixes done by legendary engineer Bob Clearmountain—complete with EQ, compression, and additional processing and routing—and you can see all of the settings to learn what he did with the stock Logic plug-ins. Drummer can also do electronic music; you can dial up any number of styles and kits, from house and retro to hip hop and electro pop. The interface changes, when appropriate, to something that models a drum machine or Akai MPC-style unit. That said, many of the acoustic drum kits sound somewhat similar, with low tom tuning, highly compressed cymbals, and deeper sounds; there's little funk, crisp heavy metal, jazz, or Latin sounds on offer, though of course you can get there with some tuning. Third-party plug-in support remains extremely robust, and you can organize your favorite plug-ins into folders. In testing, I had no problems opening up and using major plug-ins I own like Spectrasonics Atmosphere and a series of East West Play-compatible orchestral and world-instrument libraries, and mastering tracks with Izotope Ozone worked exactly as before. Mixing and Effects Apple spent plenty of time catering to its higher-end customers this time around. For starters, the summing engine has been upgraded from 32-bit (already pristine, with tons of headroom) to 64-bit. Most working studios and bedroom producers won't hear a difference. But if you've got super-large projects with tons of tracks and higher-end recording gear and studio monitors, this could matter. The more plug-ins you stack, the more you'll hear a difference. There are now 192 busses available instead of 64, and there's finally a true stereo panning option that lets you adjust the individual left and right levels instead of just attenuating either left or right signal. The main mix console offers large faders, pan and other track controls, and as many inserts and sends as you need—once again, with a flatter, cleaner, macOS-Sierra-style look. There are welcome analog-style VCA faders available. Instrument tracks keep everything neat and tidy, though most sequencers now offer some form of that, in lieu of messy audio + MIDI track combinations. At the top of each channel strip, the built-in console EQ really just pops up the EQ plug-in, which offers eight bands, plus configurable Q settings and customizable low-pass and high-pass filters. It offers enough musicality for rounding out the high-end of an electric bass or tightening up the boom of a loosely tuned kick drum. As before, you can write automation to regions, which makes it much simpler to move around and arrange your project without destroying recorded fader and knob movements. There are Relative and Trim modes for adjusting existing automation data; you can use them to ride a fader and smooth out an edit. Region Gain is similar Clip Gain, one of my favorite features in Pro Tools; it makes it easy to quickly adjust a region that for whatever reason is recorded at a different level, without having to resort to inserting a plug-in or a destructive edit. Fades are generated in real time, rather than stored as separate audio files with your project, which greatly simplifies file management. You can also finally apply fades to multiple regions simultaneously—a single change that can make sound design or track editing much faster. Flex Pitch and Flex Time make quick work of tuning vocals and fixing mistakes in recorded audio tracks. Flex Pitch in particular is a great freebie if you're used to working with an entirely separate app (like Melodyne) or needing to budget for one. I've used it extensively by this point, and with careful edits, I find it to be as transparent as you could possibly want, and I love not having to export and re-import tuned vocals each time. Logic's effects plug-ins come alive in the compressor and reverb department. The compressors in particular shine, with their Platinum (transparent solid state) and Opto (tube-like) modes, which behave differently and provide exactly the kind of warmth and crunch you'd expect from actual vintage hardware. There's a gorgeous scalable (to 5K Retina iMac levels) paneled interface for each of the modes, including a dBx 160 emulation called Classic VCA. In all, there are over 4,500 presets available across the various 80 bundled plug-in effects, plus roughly 1,000 sampled convolution reverb spaces in Space Designer. You can now side-chain a software instrument as well as a compressor. It's tough to imagine a mixing situation these tools can't cover. Unfortunately, the various recent UI updates still haven't made it to some of Logic's other long-running core plug-ins. Pop up an existing effect or even instrument, and you'll see the same old interface you've seen for over a decade—complete with now positively tiny controls (there's a pixel-quadrupled view, although it looks blocky). It's about time Apple went through and refreshed the cluttered UIs for the entire plug-in lineup, now that we're all running 1080p or even Retina-class displays. EXS24 in particular has needed an update for years; while it's optimized for playing hundreds of voices concurrently on a modern Mac running inside Logic Pro X, it could use a big UI refresh, post-Kontakt 5 and MachFive 3 (which, admittedly, cost hundreds of dollars each, whereas EXS24 is free with Logic). The same goes for the surprisingly powerful ES2 and Space Designer. GarageBand, Import/Export, and Logic Remote Over on iOS, in tandem with the Logic Pro X 10.3 update, GarageBand for iOS now shares the same underlying engine as Logic. It supports 32 tracks now, and comes with 12 Logic effects, including a visual EQ and compressor on every channel plus four additional plug-in slots. It even comes with a stripped-down version of Alchemy, including 150 patches. New to both GarageBand and Logic, you can now save a project in Logic in an iCloud/GarageBand –compatible version that sums all the tracks together as a single stereo reference track. Then you can load that on GarageBand for iOS with all tempo, key, meter, and other information intact, add up to 31 additional tracks, and then bring the whole shebang back into Logic with the original Logic tracks expanded and the new GarageBand tracks also added individually. You can also import and export XML for scoring in Final Cut Pro, and export your projects direct to SoundCloud—the days of mixing down to a CD, then figuring out how to duplicate it, encode it to MP3, put it online, etc. are long gone. Logic Pro X 10.3 still opens any project from Logic 5 or later, though I wouldn't make any promises about old third-party plug-in support if you never got around to printing straight audio tracks as backup! If you've got an iPad, the Logic Remote app turns your tablet into a remote control for all of Logic Pro X's major functions. For example, you can record tracks with on-screen keyboards, guitar fretboards, or other smart composition tools pulled directly from GarageBand on the iPad. You can make fader moves and control the transport as well, of course. But what's most interesting is that the iPad becomes the front end for Logic Pro X, if you want it to be. You can control your entire Logic Pro X-based studio from the couch, and not just Logic itself; Plug-In View lets you access third-party AU plug-ins right from the iPad. Still the Logical Choice There are hundreds of other features I simply didn't have the room for, many of which have been with the program for years. With the latest update, Apple keeps Logic Pro at the forefront of the DAW market. Any quibbles we have with the program—and some are to be expected, given the sheer breadth and depth of what Logic Pro offers—pale in comparison to its virtues. And as is more and more the case these days, you don't need a desktop machine for professional work. Add Logic Pro X 10.3, a USB MIDI keyboard, and a pair of headphones to a MacBook Air or MacBook Pro—plus an audio interface like the wonderfully designed (and very Logic-friendly) Apogee Duet, and some microphones if you're recording live instruments—and you've got a portable music studio that was simply impossible on this scale even just a few years ago, let alone using the same software the pros use on a regular basis. The competition is well established and fierce, but much of it costs more. Avid Pro Tools, MOTU Digital Performer, Cakewalk SONAR Producer, and Steinberg Cubase—what used to be considered the other four major established DAWs years ago that are still around today—all remain hundreds of dollars more expensive than Logic, and require either hardware copy protection, subscription or membership fees for support, or some combination of those. Perhaps the most compelling more expensive DAW is Ableton Live, which commands a rabid following for its unique composition and live performance-oriented UI. On the lower end, Logic does see some stronger competition from PreSonus Studio One, the utilitarian-but-bargain-priced Cockos Reaper, and long-standing electronic-dance-music favorites FL Studio and Reason. (Stay tuned for more reviews!) Logic has been around for several decades now, and by this point it's got some serious celebrity cred; most recently, Adele's Hello was recorded in Logic Pro, along with the score of the Academy Award-winning La La Land. Many commercial studios in the US remain committed to Avid's Pro Tools. But it's getting tougher and tougher to justify the costs, given how capable Logic Pro X has become, especially when coupled with high-end Apogee hardware. The need for outboard processing gear (as you'd find with Pro Tools HDX) is basically gone except for the absolute largest of projects. And now Pro Tools has a monthly subscription fee, which it didn't the last time we tested it at PCMag a few years ago. PCMag awards Logic Pro X a rare five-star rating—not because it's perfect, but rather it's an outstanding software product and an amazing value at just $199.99. If you have a Mac and haven't decided on a proper songwriting, recording, or mixing program yet, or if you're aching to upgrade from an earlier version of Logic or even GarageBand (project files from which, incidentally, still open seamlessly in Logic), Logic Pro X 10.3 is a great bet—and our Editors' Choice for digital audio workstations.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « IDC Sees Apple Watch Performance in Q4 2016 as a 'Magnificent Success' while Low-end Wearables firm Fitbit wins in Volume | Main | Apple Invents Next-Gen Fabrics that could one Day be used for iDevice Housings and Beyond » March 03, 2017 Apple Invents a Next-Gen iPhone Case that Incorporates a Heat Removal System to keep it Safe and Humming   Yesterday the US Patent & Trademark Office published a patent application from Apple that relates to a new accessory device that, in addition to providing a protective cover for the electronic device, it provides a heat removal system to draw heat from one or more heat-generating components in the electronic device. At a first glance, the patent figures appeared to have a similar look as the iPhone 5c case. However in patent FIG. 15 further below you'll clearly see that the third layer and backside of the case is solid without holes. So there's absolutely no connection to the former fruity 5c case design.   Accessory devices are used to provide a protective cover for an electronic device. The accessory device generally covers the enclosure, or housing, and protects the electronic device in the event the electronic device is dropped. The thickness of an accessory device varies with the desired level of protection. For example, some accessory devices include a thickness of several millimeters and offer increased protection.   However, while the increased thickness may provide additional protection, it may also cause some drawbacks such as trapping heat which could cause problems. In some cases, heat could cause an iPhone (or other electronic device) to throttle down to reduce its performance in order to reduce the heat, which may then in turn reduce the overall performance of the iPhone.   Alternatively, or in combination, the accessory device may retain the heat causing a hot spot in the accessory device. As a result, a user contacting the hot spot may experience a burn.   Apple's invention to combat this problem is to reinvent an iPhone's casing by adding a new heat transfer mechanism on the face that accepts the backside of the iPhone.   The heat transfer mechanism may include a heat collector capable of receiving heat generated from the component. The heat transfer mechanism may further include a heat conduit thermally coupled with the heat collector. The heat conduit may provide a pre-defined heat path that limits a transfer of heat to a pre-defined portion of the wall.   In another aspect, a method for forming an accessory device having a shell configured to secure an electronic device and aid in navigating heat away from a heat-generating component in the electronic device is described. The method may include disposing a thermally conductive layer in the shell in a first location that corresponds to a location of the heat-generating component when the electronic device is secured by the shell. The method may further include extending the thermally conductive layer from the first location to a second location different from the first location. The thermally conductive layer may define a path along which heat flows from the first location to the second location. In some embodiments, the second location corresponds to an opening that extends through the shell to allow any of the heat at the opening to dissipate away from the shell.   In some embodiments, in response to heat from the heat-generating component, the thermally conductive feature absorbs the heat from the electronic device by changing from a solid to a liquid.   Apple's patent FIG. 3 noted above illustrates a front view of the accessory device with the iPhone removed to show the new heat navigation features; FIG. 12 noted below illustrates a bottom isometric view of an embodiment of an electronic device having heat navigation features embedded in an enclosure of the electronic device.   Triple Layer Construction   The First Layer: Apple's patent FIG. 15 noted below illustrates an exploded view of an alternative embodiment of an accessory device. The first layer #910 of the new case is formed from a porous material, such as microfiber to allow heat generated from an electronic device (not shown) to pass through the first layer. Also, the first layer may include one or more thermally conductive features #912 (shown as dotted lines), such as a first thermally conductive feature #914 and a second thermally conductive feature #916. The thermally conductive features 912 may be disposed on a rear exterior region 918 of the first layer 910. In some embodiments, the thermally conductive features include a material (or materials) designed to absorb heat.   Further, the thermally conductive features may absorb heat by a phase change. For example, in response to heat generated by one or more heat-generating components in an electronic device, the thermally conductive features may absorb or extract the heat, causing the thermally conductive features to change from a solid state to a liquid (or quasi-liquid) state.   The Second Layer: The accessory device 900 may further include a second layer 920 designed to couple with the first layer 910. The second layer 920 may be formed from a polymeric material, such as plastic, designed to add structural rigidity to the accessory device 900.   The Third Layer: The accessory device 900 may further include a third layer 930 designed to couple with the second layer 920. In some embodiments, the third layer 930 includes a silicone material. In this regard, the third layer 930 may be designed to provide an aesthetic and low-maintenance cover that may easily cleaned and may readily resist microorganisms.   Apple's patent application was filed back in Q3 2015. Considering that this is a patent application, the timing of such a product to market is unknown at this time. One of the inventors listed on the patent filing is Apple's Product Design Manager.   Patently Apple presents a detailed summary of patent applications with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each such patent application is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trade Office.

Latest: Target returns unsold iPhone SE models ahead of rumoured iPhone SE 2 announcement. by David Price | 03 Mar 17 Share Tweet   Comments When will the new iPhone SE 2 be released in the UK? Welcome to our roundup of the latest iPhone SE 2 release date rumours, in which we collect and analyse the clues, hints and evidence pointing to the date when Apple will launch a follow-up to 2016's iPhone SE, as well as the iPhone SE 2's tech specs, design, new features and UK pricing. This page will be updated whenever new information emerges relating to the launch of an updated iPhone SE in 2017, so check back regularly for the latest iPhone SE 2 rumours. You may also like: Best iPhone SE deals | iPhone buying guide New iPhone SE 2 2017 release date rumours UK: Release date One logical date to expect the iPhone SE launch would be March 2017, given that the original iPhone SE was announced in March 2016 and Apple usually updates its phone lines once a year. But reports suggest we'll have to wait a little longer than that. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has forecast that the iPhone SE 2 won't make an appearance in 2017 at all, on the principle that Apple doesn't want to cannibalise sales of the (higher-margin) iPhone 7. The SE 2, after all, would be a newer alternative at a lower price. Ming-Chi Kuo has a tremendous track record of Apple predictions, but we're not entirely convinced: six months as undisputed flagship ought to give the iPhone 7 more than enough time to rack up some decent sales, and anyone who opts instead for the iPhone SE 2 after that was more likely in any case to buy a first-gen SE or a smaller Android device than an iPhone 7. (And Apple was quite happy to risk cannibalising iPhone 6s sales by launching the original iPhone SE six months later - that strategy appeared to work out okay.) Still, four-inch smartphones appear to be a lower priority for Apple than its larger-screen handsets: there was a 30-month hiatus between the iPhone 5s launch (September 2013) and the SE (March 2016). Maybe Kuo is right. The iPhone SE could even turn out to be a one-off, like the iPhone 5c. Despite the chances of a one off, Macrumors reported in February that we could see a 128GB version of the iPhone SE introduced in March alongside new iPad models. This would make sense given the iPhone 7 saw the 16GB tier cut to make way for 32GB. Coupled with the relatively affordability of the SE, 128GB could prove a sweet spot for those who want a small handset but high capacity iPhone.  Off the back of the initial Macrumours report, the site now reports that US store Target has been instructed to return a large number of unsold iPhone SE models to Apple by March 1. The list of SE models includes unlocked 16- and 64GB models in Gold, Silver, Rose Gold and Space Grey, along with two Sprint variants of the phone.  An anonymous tip to the site claims that her Target store hadn't received any iPhone SE stock since before the iPhone 7 was announced back in September 2016, prompting some to connect the dots that suggest a new iPhone SE is imminent. Of course, there are other reasons that Apple would request unsold iPhone SE models, like poor sales, but the timing seems a little bit too suspicious to us.  See also: iPad Pro 2 rumours Turn to the next page to read all the details of the iPhone SE launch >> >> Read on… Pages 1 2 3 4 Tags: iPhone , Rumour , iPhone 5s , iPhone 5c , iPhone 6 , iPhone 6s Share this article Share Tweet   Comments Comments Advertisement Nintendo Switch review: Portable power and versatile design let down by expensive accessories and… 1995-2015: How technology has changed the world in 20 years The Best Design Podcasts: 6 Entertaining, Insightful Podcasts for Designers iPhone 9 release date & new features: Future iPhone technologies and smartphone developments for… Apple News Apple Reviews Apple How To Macworld Magazine Apple Deals Mac Forums Apple Mac iPhone Reviews iPad Reviews Mac Downloads About Macworld Contact Site Map Information for advertisers Privacy Policy Terms & Conditions Cookies UK Tech Weekly Podcast:Soundcloud/ iTunes Follow Macworld on Twitter Follow Macworld on Facebook © Copyright 2017 IDG UK.

New Atlas Lifestyle Science Technology Transport Search Subscribe Smartwatches Huawei Watch 2 vs. Apple Watch Series 2 Emily FerronMarch 4th, 2017 20 pictures The second-generation Huawei Watch and the Apple Watch Series 2 have similar specs, but different approachesView gallery - 20 images The Huawei Watch 2 represents a big, sporty departure from its more traditional-looking predecessor. In terms of specs, it compares favorably to the Apple Watch Series 2, though the two makers' approaches are quite different. Let's take a look. Note that for the sake of this comparison, we are considering two variations of the Huawei Watch 2: the Huawei Watch 2 base model and the Huawei Watch 2 Classic, which vary slightly in features and aesthetic. There are also two sizes of Apple Watch (42 mm and 38 mm) which are very similarly equipped. In many cases, there are no differences in the pair of options from each maker. In those instances, we've only included one image to be representative of both. Size Both variants of the Huawei Watch 2 are the same size, which is considerably bulkier than the rectangular, contemporary-looking Apple Watches. Its round face is about 20-percent wider than that of the larger Apple Watch. The Huawei Watch is also considerably thicker – it will stick out about 17-percent further from your wrist. Build (watch face) The base model Huawei Watch 2 has a partially-plastic case with ceramic bezel and Gorilla Glass 3 display covering, while its more traditional-looking counterpart, the Watch 2 Classic, uses stainless steel. The entry-level Apple Watch 2 models are built out of aluminum, with Ion-X glass on the front (similar to Gorilla Glass). For a premium, you can also upgrade to stainless steel or ceramic builds with a sapphire display. Colors (watch face) Color choices for the Huawei Watch 2 depend on the configuration. The Watch 2 Classic is only available in one dark metallic gray color, but the base model is available in orange (4G models only), gray (non 4G models) or black (both 4G and non 4G). The aluminum build on the Apple Watch is available in four different metallic finishes. There are additional neutral and metallic options available if you upgrade to stainless or ceramic. Band All of these watches have removable, interchangeable bands, so if you don't like the manufacturer's choice, you can always swap to something you like better. The Huawei Watch 2 comes with a rubbery-plastic sport strap, while the Watch 2 Classic has a leather strap that's reinforced with a rubber-like material on the inside. With the Apple Watch Series 2, you can choose from a bevy of material and color options. Display size The round display on the Huawei Watch 2 packs in more overall area than the rectangular Apple Watches, despite the larger diagonal measurements of the latter. Display resolution Exact pixel counts vary, but all of these watches end up with a pixel density of 326 pixels per inch. Always-on display option An always-on option is conspicuously absent from the Apple Watch – you'll have to wake the watch to see time and other key notifications. Pressure-sensitive display The Apple Watch has a pressure-sensitive display, so you can navigate differently depending on how hard you tap the screen. This can be helpful when trying to navigate on such a small device. Scrolling navigation Similarly, the Apple Watch also has a rotating "Digital Crown" – you can turn the crown to flip through your apps and content. Again, this adds a comfortable way to navigate through your watch, so you don't need to depend on taps or voice control. Smartwatches from Samsung and LG add similar scrolling features, but Huawei has yet to join the club (though the two physical buttons on the side of the watch face could be helpful). Water resistance The Huawei Watch's IP68 water resistance rating means it's safe from splashes and accidental dunks, but the Apple Watch is fully swim-proof to 50 meters. You can leave it on in the shower and the pool, and even use it as a fitness tracker during swimming workouts. Standalone cellular option Some models of the Huawei Watch 2 are available with 4G cellular connectivity, so you can use your watch completely independently of your phone. That's not an option with the Apple Watch. GPS Both watches are GPS-equipped. Heart rate sensor They also have heart rate sensors for your fitness tracking (or meditative) needs. NFC Both watches have NFC, the technology that enables mobile payments. The Apple Watch works with Apple Pay while the Huawei Watch is Android Pay-compatible. Battery Many factors go into overall smartwatch battery life. It's tough to say which watch has longer life overall without conducting controlled side-by-side tests. iPhone/Android compatibility The Huawei Watch 2 can be paired with both Androids and iPhones. Apple Watches can only be used with iPhones. Software The Huawei Watch 2 runs Android Wear 2.0, which was just released earlier this month. It has a few perks which help it untether from your phone, such as an on-board version of the Google Play Store. The Apple Watch runs watchOS 3. Release The Huawei Watch 2 is expected to hit several markets starting next month. The Apple Watch Series 2 was released last September. Starting price The Apple Watch Series 2 starts at US$369, but if you opt for build upgrades the price can go much higher. Huawei has yet to confirm US pricing of its second-generation smartwatch. If you want some indication of the Huawei Watch 2's cost, the European price tags are €329 for the Watch 2, €379 for its LTE variant and €399 for the Classic. That's about US$345, $400 and $420, respectively, though international prices are very rarely direct conversions based on the exchange rate. Once the Huawei Watch 2 is released, we will post a full-length review. Read up on our hands-on impressions of the Huawei Watch 2 or our review of the Apple Watch. Correction: The original version of this comparison omitted ceramic from the Huawei Watch 2 (standard) build materials. We regret the error.

Open-source. Suitable for government and other security-conscious offices. The only desktop suite available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Can open and convert almost any legacy document or worksheet. Cons Less stable and not as good-looking suites from Microsoft, Google, and Apple. Online collaboration requires manual installation by an IT expert on a corporate or office-based server. Some dialogs and options are cramped or incomprehensible. Bottom Line LibreOffice is free and open-source, opens almost any legacy document, and is the only office suite available on all major desktop platforms. What it lacks is the smooth interface and stability of its paid competitors. By Edward Mendelson There are lots of reasons to choose the free LibreOffice 5 as your office suite, and plenty of reasons to choose something else, too. The best reason for choosing it is that it's the only fully up-to-date open-source office suite, meaning that security-conscious users like governments and financial institutions—who are typically leery about proprietary office apps from Microsoft, Google, or Apple—can use LibreOffice in full confidence that everything it does is publicly visible, and that none of their data is slipping surreptitiously into some remote database in the name of enhanced productivity. This review focuses mainly on version 5.3 of LibreOffice for Windows, but I also tested it on the Mac, as I'll explain. //Compare Similar Products Compare Microsoft Office 2016 (for Windows)   %displayPrice%%seller% Corel WordPerfect Office X8   %displayPrice%%seller% Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides   %displayPrice%%seller% Microsoft Office 2016 (for Mac)   %displayPrice%%seller% Microsoft Office 365 Home   %displayPrice%%seller% Pages (for Mac)   %displayPrice%%seller% Keynote (for Mac)   %displayPrice%%seller% Numbers (for Mac)   %displayPrice%%seller% Office Mobile for Office 365 Subscribers (for iPhone)   %displayPrice%%seller% LibreOffice (for Mac)   %displayPrice%%seller% Google Drive   %displayPrice%%seller% Keynote (for iPhone)   %displayPrice%%seller% IBM Lotus Symphony 3.0   %displayPrice%%seller% Microsoft Excel (for iPad)   %displayPrice%%seller% Microsoft PowerPoint (for iPad)   %displayPrice%%seller% Free and Flexible Other reasons for choosing LibreOffice include that it's free; that it's available with an identical interface and feature set in Windows, macOS, and Linux; and that it's one of the few suites that can open and convert almost any legacy document that you or your office may have created over the last three decades. Another attraction is that LibreOffice still uses the familiar toolbar-and-icon menu structure that millions of users learned from older versions of Microsoft Office, but which Microsoft abandoned ten years ago for the new Ribbon interface. As for the reasons to choose something else, I'll get to those later. Office Work LibreOffice combines a word-processor called Writer, a spreadsheet called Calc, a presentations app called Impress, a vector-drawing program called Draw, a database called Base, and a math-formula editor called Math. The newly released version 5.3 retains the old-school interface of earlier versions, but with more features added to the optional sidebar panel and standard shortcut keys like Ctrl-C and Ctrl-V for cutting and pasting visible on the menu and enabled by default. View All 10 Photos in Gallery A new Safe Mode lets you start LibreOffice with a new user profile, disable extensions, or reset the whole configuration. All this is designed to help you fix the suite when it starts crashing regularly—a problem that, in my experience, is more common in the macOS version than the Windows version. (I haven't been able to fix this problem in macOS, but it's more of a time-wasting annoyance than a data-losing disaster because it usually happens when I try to open a file.) The Writer word-processor finally provides a dialog that lets you jump to a specific page number, supports preset table styles, adds a line-drawing toolbar, and enhances color-selection tools and coordinated color themes that more closely match the stylish ones in Microsoft Office. The Calc spreadsheet acts more like Excel, with wildcards rather than regular expressions as the default setting in formulas, enhanced pivot-table dialogs, and a function-selection menu that narrows down your choices as you type. The Impress presentations app, never a strong point, gets some moderately stylish new templates and a new template-selection dialog when Impress opens up, but don't expect anything like the elegant design and gee-whiz animations that Microsoft gives you with PowerPoint and Apple with Keynote. LibreOffice's main rivals are Microsoft Office, Google Docs, Sheet, and Slides, the corporate G Suite, and Apple's Pages, Numbers, and Keynote, formerly marketed as a suite under the name iWork. All these rivals exist in online versions accessible through a web browser or mobile apps, and all support real-time remote collaboration. Microsoft and Apple's apps exist in both desktop and mobile versions; Google's are only online. Until now, LibreOffice, in its full version, was available only for the desktop. Now, it's also available in a browser-accessible LibreOffice Online version, complete with collaborative editing, but only if your IT department installs it for you. There's no publicly available LibreOffice Online, as there is for Microsoft's, Apple's, and Google's apps. LibreOffice's developers have made slow but steady progress into making the sidebar panel into an easy-to-use alternative to the menus and toolbars, and I'm impressed with the current version's spacious, clean design. The LibreOffice sidebar looks a lot like the sidebar in Apple Keynote, Numbers, and Pages but Apple gets things right that LibreOffice doesn't. For example, Apple's page-layout sidebar lets you enter custom settings for all four page margins. LibreOffice's sidebar only lets you choose among preset margin settings, and you need to open a separate dialog to set custom margins. Once you've set custom margins, the sidebar shows Custom as one of the available margin settings—but if you click on Custom, you don't get back to the dialog where you change the settings. Instead, you have to go back to the separate margin-setting dialog. Apple and Microsoft get this kind of thing right in their desktop suites, but keep in mind that you have to pay for those suites while LibreOffice is free. Legacy File Formats I mentioned LibreOffice's compatibility with legacy file formats. This is a major feature for anyone who may have to work with files created decades ago in obsolete word processors or spreadsheets, and LibreOffice far outclasses Microsoft, Google and Apple in this arena. Its closest rival is the Windows-only Corel WordPerfect Office suite, which also opens almost any legacy document, but, oddly, can't open documents created by the last, unofficial release of WordPerfect for the Mac, while LibreOffice can. If you work in a school, office, or lab with legacy documents, LibreOffice is an essential tool even if you don't use it for everyday work. Clunky and Crashy As for reasons to choose something other than LibreOffice, these may be decisive for you as they are for me. First of all, despite improvements, it's clunky to look at and crashes more than it should. You can easily change its ugly default font, the open-source Liberation Serif font, but until you do, no one will be impressed by your documents. The most commonly used menus are clear and spacious, especially the ones in the sidebar pane, but the Options menu is cramped and often incomprehensible unless you've been using LibreOffice for years. Next, until someone funds a publicly accessible version of LibreOffice online—and that's not likely to happen—you can't work with LibreOffice remotely in the way you can with Microsoft, Apple, and Google. Another problem is that some features simply don't work—or at least don't work reliably enough to rely on. The Mac version of LibreOffice typically crashes a few seconds after I import any Word document, though the same documents cause no problems when I import them in LibreOffice's Windows version. On both the Mac and Windows versions, I wasted a lot of time trying to use an option to access "remote files" on Google Drive or OneDrive, but every effort to log in to those drives produced an obscure error message saying "The specified device is invalid." I eventually discovered that I had encountered a known bug that's been left unfixed for a year. This isn't how professional-quality software is supposed to work. When I edit documents in Microsoft Word in Window (or via Word in Office on the Mac), I turn on the feature that hides the top and bottom margins of the page, so that when I type a sentence that begins on one page and ends on another, I don't have to look at two inches of blank space where the page break occurs. LibreOffice has nothing like this, offering only a Web View that doesn't show any page formatting at all. This hide-blank-space feature may not matter to you, but once you get accustomed to it, there's no going back. A Good Backup Suite LibreOffice is an impressive achievement that keeps getting better with its frequent incremental releases, and anyone who has legacy documents lurking on a hard disk ought to have a copy. But unless you have security requirements that demand open-source software, or your organization needs apps that work on Linux as well as on Windows and the Mac, you're likely going to prefer to pay for Microsoft Office or use Apple's or Google's apps instead.

Includes background music that automatically fits your movies. Good collection of filter effects. Output can be sent to Premiere Pro. Online video sharing. Cons Lacks storyboard templates. Cannot rotate video. Automatic mode cuts too aggressively. No choice of transitions. Bottom Line Premiere Clip is Adobe's mobile app companion to Premiere Pro, and it offers useful lighting adjustment features and clip joining, trimming, and splitting tools. Still, it lacks templates, a choice of transitions, and video rotation. By Michael Muchmore If you have an iPhone 6s or later Apple smartphone, you should take advantage of its glorious 4K video capture capability. And you definitely want to show people well-presented digital movies rather than random, untrimmed video clips. That's where Adobe Premier Clip comes in, letting you cut and combine footage shot on your iPhone into pleasing presentations. Even though editing video on such a small screen isn't ideal, the app makes spiffing up video clips shot on the phone simple. And it lets you continue editing on the desktop in Premiere Pro, thanks to Creative Cloud. Clip is an easy-to-use, effective app, but Apple's iMovie tops it in a few significant ways. //Compare Similar Products Compare iMovie (for iPad)   %displayPrice%%seller% Instagram (for iPhone)   %displayPrice%%seller% Artisto (for iPhone)   %displayPrice%%seller% Snapchat (for iPhone)   %displayPrice%%seller% Boomerang from Instagram (for iPhone)   %displayPrice%%seller% Apple iMovie (for Mac OS X)   %displayPrice%%seller% Adobe Premiere Pro CC   %displayPrice%%seller% Getting Started Clip is a free app, but you do have to sign into an Adobe account—which includes a free option—to use it. It doesn't require Premiere Pro on the desktop. At 91MB, Premiere Clip is a much smaller download than iMovie's more than 600MB. It runs on iOS 8.1 or later, so your device can be pretty out of date and still run the app. I tested the app on my iPhone 6s with 64GB of memory. View All 5 Photos in Gallery Using Premiere Clip The app offers two editing modes: Automatic and Freeform. The former adds a music track timed to your movie and cuts clips down to what the app considers the interesting bits. Freeform is just as it sounds; it gives you complete control over your project. Adobe has removed the Guide mode since the last time I reviewed the app a few years ago. This offered storyboards for common projects, such as interviews, news reports, and fight scenes. The professional Premiere Pro users won't miss this feature, but it makes the app less appealing for consumer users. The Apple iMovie app still offers this kind of guidance, with its Trailers and Themes features. I first added several clips I shot at a community college basketball tournament and chose Automatic. The default music wasn't appropriately energetic, but selecting a more driving soundtrack from the list of canned music was easy. You can also use music from tracks on your iPhone. More disconcerting was how unsparingly the app cut my clips. When I created an automatic movie with iMovie using the same material, the result was more pleasing, with elegant dissolve transitions added. Clip does offer a Pace option, which lengthens clips. And photos get the Ken Burns zoom-and-pan treatment to keep up the viewer's interest. In Automatic mode, you can reorder clips, but you can't trim them to taste. Freeform Editing If you choose Freeform, you obviously get a lot more control, and you can in fact convert Automatic projects to Freeform. In Freeform, not only can you trim each clip's in and out points, but the app lets you adjust exposure, highlights, and shadows. I do prefer iMovie's trimming interface, though, in which you move the clip preview, rather than the trim endpoint. Settings in Freeform mode let you apply fade-in and fade-out to black, as well as crossfades between clips. They also let you apply Looks to your entire movie, including film, retro, and B&W looks. Several of these are really appealing, and most are subtler than Instagram filters. You can also split a clip at the play head, but iMovie makes that even easier. Finally, you can slow down clips, though forget about speeding them up or applying freeze-frame, both of which are options in iMovie. Other important things missing in Clip are the ability to rotate video and a choice of transitions, both of which are offered by—you guessed it—iMovie. Rotation is particularly important for iPhone videos, as it's easy in the heat of the moment to shoot in portrait rather than landscape orientation. And now something for the pro video editor: Storycard. This feature lets movie makers add notes, sketches, location shots, or cue cards. A Storycard is an image in the midst of your video to which you can add a text title or something shot from your iPhone camera. There's not much there to guide you in how to use it, however. Sharing and Output Clip, like so many media-editing apps, includes its very own sharing community. Along with saving your creation to your phone, you can share directly to Dropbox, YouTube, and Twitter (Facebook, Instagram,, and Snapchat are oddly absent here). And back in the Adobe fold you save it to Creative Cloud (which is basically Adobe's version of iCloud Drive or Dropbox), send it to Premiere Pro CC (but not Premiere Elements), or choose Publish and Share. This last option sends the video to Adobe hosting, from which you can share to Facebook, send in email, or copy a link. If you choose Public (the default), other Clip users can find and play your video from within the app. Free accounts get 2GB of online storage, and Creative Cloud subscribers get 20GB. This is actually more helpful than Apple's iMovie Theater sharing option, which only allows playing on Apple devices you yourself are signed into. Of course, you can still post to your social networks from iMovie or save your creation to your phone's storage. Best for Premiere Aficionados The best reason to use the Adobe Premiere Clip app is if you're a Premiere Pro user and occasionally want to save a video idea when you're out and about. It does offer some quick-and-dirty editing tools like trimming and lighting fixes, along with an appealing selection of effect filters. But the average iPhone user is better served by Apple's more capable and more usable iMovie app. Back to top PCMag may earn affiliate commissions from the shopping links included on this page.

By Edward Mendelson Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides is Google's free-for-everyone online office suite, and it excels at helping users create and share documents, spreadsheets, and presentations. If you're sharing a small number of documents with only a few colleagues, the free version of this suite is enough. But for corporate, educational, or any other organized, collective operation, you'll want the paid (starting at $5 per user per month) subscription-based versions that Google offers under the name G Suite. //Compare Similar Products Compare Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides   %displayPrice%%seller% Microsoft Office 365 Home   %displayPrice%%seller% Microsoft Office 2016 (for Windows)   %displayPrice%%seller% LibreOffice 5   %displayPrice%%seller% Microsoft Office 2016 (for Mac)   %displayPrice%%seller% Corel WordPerfect Office X8   %displayPrice%%seller% Apple Pages (for Mac)   %displayPrice%%seller% Apple Numbers (for Mac)   %displayPrice%%seller% Apple Keynote (for Mac)   %displayPrice%%seller% G Suite's Competition G Suite has powerful rivals, including various corporate-level versions of Microsoft Office 365; Apple's set of iCloud-accessible apps, Pages, Numbers, and Keynote (which used to be sold as a suite called iWork); and online collaboration services like Zoho. Even when compared with these productivity titans, G Suite has plenty of advantages, and it gets new and improved features every few weeks. It has limits too, however, as I'll explain, so you need to make sure it strikes the right balance for your needs before committing to it. Getting Started With G Suite I set up a G Suite account through a simple wizard that required me to choose a domain name, either one I already owned, or a new domain that I could create by paying a $12 annual registration fee. I created a new domain, PCMagReviewers.com, and then created e-mail accounts at that address for myself and some colleagues. The setup screen let me send out messages to my colleagues' existing addresses notifying them of the new addresses I had created for them. After that, I signed in at google.com using my new e-mail address, and a menu at the upper right of the window let me access all the G Suite apps. View All 10 Photos in Gallery G Suite offers three versions: Basic, Business, and Enterprise. All include the Google apps and calendar, video and voice conferencing, and management features. The Basic service costs $5 per user per month and gives you a total of 30 GB of cloud storage, shared among users. The Business version costs $10 per user per month and offers unlimited storage, plus archiving, auditing and data-retention features for corporate compliance, and electronic discovery for use when gathering legal evidence. Enterprise plans are priced individually and add advanced security, data-retention, and data-analysis features. Note that business subscriptions to Office 365 also start at $5 per user per month. G Suite's management menus are clear and straightforward, but Microsoft's equivalent menus in corporate versions of Office 365 seem to me easier to navigate and visually more elegant. Apple doesn't offer a corporate-level service comparable to G Suite or Office 365, though the $19.95 macOS Server add-on to macOS provides features for sharing files, calendars, contacts, and mail accounts. G Suite Administration I've been using an enterprise version of G Suite for years through a large organization that I work for, but, for this review, I tested G Suite's Basic service to get an idea of what it's like to administer the suite instead of merely using the setup that an administrator created for me. As in corporate-level versions of Office 365 and Zoho Docs, I used a site-creating wizard to build a website for my new domain, and make it accessible either only to users with addresses at PCMagReviewers.com or to anyone on the web. The Google Sites app that creates these sites has all the elegance and simplicity of Google's other apps, making it effortless to build a multipage site in less than an hour. Google Sites is free for anyone to use, but free users can only create sites with a sites.google.com address, while G Suite subscribers use their own domain name as their site address, just as in any other paid web-hosting service. Office Suite Functionality G Suite's versions of Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides offer the same elegant, minimalist-looking templates that you get in the free versions, but G Suite lets you upload your own documents, spreadsheets, or presentations to use as templates for creating new ones. For collaboration and sharing, G Suite offers more options than you get with the free Google apps. For example, you can specify that a document can be shared only with members of your organization, or only members of your organization to whom you've sent a sharing link. As with the free Google office suite, you can specify that changes made to your document by your collaborators appear in color, to indicate that they're suggestions rather than actual edits. These suggestions can be accepted or rejected one by one by clicking on buttons in the comment panel at the right of the window. When you choose G Suite over Office 365 or Apple's apps, you're making a major decision to rely on data and apps that live almost entirely in the cloud, accessible only in a browser or a mobile device. Google doesn't supply desktop apps like the desktop versions of Microsoft Word or Excel or Apple's Pages and Numbers. If you want to edit your documents on a Wi-Fi challenged airplane, you'll need to edit them in Google's Chrome browser via an optional extension. And, before you go offline, you'll need to download every document that you want to edit. I'm not willing to take that kind of trouble every time I risk being somewhere—like a typical Amtrak train—where Wi-Fi may suddenly stop working. Office Suite in the Cloud In contrast with Google's cloud-only apps, Microsoft's and Apple's apps run either on the desktop or in a browser or mobile device, and the desktop apps have the kind of power that no mobile app can offer. Also, Microsoft's OneDrive and Apple's iCloud typically store copies of your documents on your hard disk and also in the cloud, whereas Google stores only links to your documents in the Google Drive folder that you can create on your hard disk. You can download your Google documents to your hard disk but only in formats like Office format or Open Document (LibreOffice) format, not in the Google Docs format itself. I'm not entirely comfortable with the idea that my documents live in the cloud in a format that I can't download on my hard disk, but this may not bother you as much as it does me. Cloud-only apps like Google's always have a reduced feature set compared to desktop equivalents, but the vast majority of documents and worksheets don't need any more features than Google provides. The apps in G Suite have Google's typically elegant interface, and I'm impressed with the way Google takes keyboard accessibility seriously. The toolbars and menus display keyboard shortcuts for almost every feature, so you don't need to strain your wrist mousing around the screen as you mostly need to do with Apple's apps. (Microsoft's online Office also offers plenty of keyboard shortcuts.) Editing and Versioning The Google apps keep track of all editing changes that you make on your document, going back to the time it was first created. You can revert to an older version of your Google Slides presentation or simply use the document-history feature to look back at an old version to find and copy text that you want to paste into the current version. Microsoft and Apple both offer a Track Changes option, but you need to remember to turn it on, and it's much more convenient to have it running by default. Apple's apps let you turn on revision tracking in the desktop version, but the online versions of Apple's apps don't support revision tracking at all, which can be a problem. If you use a browser to open a document that has revision tracking switched on, you won't be able to edit it. Another advantage in Google's apps is the Explore pane, which you can open from the menu or a keyboard shortcut. Like Microsoft's Smart Lookup feature, Explore searches the web for relevant information about your document. Unlike Microsoft's feature, however, Google displays a quotation-mark icon next to each of its search hits. Click on this icon, and the reference material is inserted into your document as a footnote. You'll probably need to format and revise the footnote text, but you'll avoid a lot of complicated steps required to add references in any other app. An Excellent Office Suite G Suite has plenty to offer any organization that needs a collaboration-ready office suite, a website, shared calendars, and mail services. Compared with Office 365, which exists on the desktop and in the cloud, G Suite is cloud-only, and that's either an advantage or a disadvantage, depending on your needs. Cloud-only apps are an advantage if you want to assure that everything produced by your organization is always available. They're a disadvantage if you want the full power of desktop apps, or if you need offline access to your files. I'm impressed with the ease, elegance, speed, and depth of G Suite, and if I still prefer to get my work done in Office 365, that's because I need the full power of desktop apps like Microsoft Word for the work I do. If your organization can manage with the relatively lightweight cloud-only apps in G Suite, and you don't mind keeping your documents in Google Drive, G Suite is a superbly powerful and elegant choice and an Editors' Choice winner for business-class cloud-based office suites.

That’s impressive when you consider the streaming music provider just hit the 30 million member mark a year ago and crossed 40 million paid users in September. In comparison, Apple said last December that it had 20 million Apple Music subscribers. Apple’s Eddy Cue said in February that Apple Music had well over 20 million users but failed to reveal how many. Thank you to our 50 million subscribers. #Spotify50 pic.twitter.com/eXkOV71bwu — Spotify (@Spotify) March 2, 2017 In March 2016, Tidal said it has passed the three million subscriber milestone although data obtained by Norwegian newspaper Dagens Næringsliv claims the actual number of subscribers it reported to record labels was only 850,000. Sprint bought 33 percent of Tidal in January. Spotify said last June that it now has more than 100 million active monthly users but many of those don’t pay for the service and instead use the ad-supported tier. It’s unclear how many total active listeners Spotify has today. Word surfaced just the other day that Spotify is preparing to launch a new subscription tier that’ll afford lossless CD-quality audio. Although the company has yet to announce or confirm the service, several people on social media presented screenshots in which they were propositioned to sign up for Spotify Hi-Fi for anywhere between $5 to $10 extra per month.

But it seems the Wall Street Journal, which ran the report, may not have been totally accurate; there will be USB Type-C, but only on one end of the power cord – the handset itself will retain the Lightning port. That’s the opinion of renowned KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who wrote in a note to investors that all three iPhones set to be launched this year – the flagship 8 and what are likely to be the iPhone 7s/7s Plus – “will support fast charging by the adoption of Type-C Power Delivery technology (while still retaining the Lightning port)." So, it seems what Apple may actually be replacing is the regular USB connector on one end of the power cable with USB Type-C. A setup that would allow owners to plug their new iPhones into the latest MacBook Pros, which sport only Type-C ports, to charge their handsets. Kuo’s prediction sounds much more plausible than Apple removing the Lighting port from the iPhones – and makes more sense. Apple's reversible connector only arrived back in 2012 on the iPhone 5, and the analyst notes it is smaller than USB Type-C, allowing for a slimmer phone design. Moreover, there’s also the Lightning licensing revenue to consider. Apple’s new iPhones are rumored to be unveiled this October, including the 5.8-inch $1000 model, which is expected to be the first to feature an OLED panel - and it will likely be a curved one.

The report mentions that Eddy Cue, Apple’s Senior Vice President in charge of Internet Software and Services, former Beats head Jimmy Iovine and Apple’s content chief Robert Kondrk are all said to be involved with the negotiations. “Robert Kondrk, Eddy Cue, Jimmy Iovine, everyone is trying to be the person,” one insider told the publication. “They each want to be the guy, and they’re telling people, don’t deal with the other one.” “Eddy is talking to some people. Jimmy is talking to others,” noted a second insider. “They just haven’t figured it out.” Another source added that Apple seems to have “a lot of trepidation” about the world of Hollywood entertainment. Cue and Apple’s boss Tim Cook are reportedly on the hunt in La La Land, with visions of studio mogulhood dancing in their heads. Last week, Cue allegedly held talks with Paramount Pictures and Sony Pictures, two of the biggest film studios in Hollywood. Apple is currently dippings its toes in original content with Apple Music-exclusives such as “Carpool Karaoke” and “Planet of the Apps”, but sources said that the Cupertino company may be “preparing something big,” potentially looking for a “transformative acquisition” in the entertainment space rather than “just a deal to buy TV shows”. If Apple is looking to acquire big name players in Hollywood, I don’t think Netflix would be the right pick due to its sheer size, market valuation (nearly $60 billion) and unique corporate culture. The Cupertino firm reportedly considered acquiring Time Warner but ultimately failed, leaving the field clear for AT&T’s $80 billion buy. A recent Bloomberg article blamed lack of major takeover deals on Apple’s arrogance and risk aversion, but offered no proof beyond quotes from investment bankers who argued that the Cupertino company should hire investment bankers to make more large acquisitions (so that these bankers could get their fair share of Apple’s cash). The iPhone maker, however, is frequently mentioned as a potential partner for Disney. Notably, Disney CEO Robert Iger has a seat on Apple’s board of directors while Jobs’s widow, Laurene Powell Jobs, has a stake in Disney through a trust established following her husband’s passing. Powell was Disney’s largest single shareholder before recently reducing her ownership stake in the Mouse House by half, according to an SEC disclosure in January 2017. She now owns less than five percent of Disney’s outstanding shares. Apple has for years attempted to persuade content owners to allow it to sell their programming in an à la carte fashion, something Hollywood has long resisted. The company then focused its energies on trying to put together a so-called skinny bundle of the most popular channels, to no avail. “We’re not in the business of trying to create TV shows,” Apple’s Eddy Cue was quoted as saying recently. “We’re not trying to compete with Netflix or compete with Comcast.” “In terms of original content, we’ve put our toe in the water doing some original content for Apple Music, and that will be rolling out throughout the year,” said Apple CEO Tim Cook on a recent conference call. “We’re learning from that and we’ll go from there.” As a slap in Apple’s face, Google’s YouTube announced this week a streaming live TV bundle, called YouTube TV, which offers content from four major networks (Fox, ABC, CBS and NBC) and 39 other local broadcast networks and channels like ESPN, with unlimited DVR, for $35 per month. Google’s new service will be live later this spring.

The 32GB gold iPhone 6 is labelled as a “2017” model, which would technically be correct as Apple never previously released a 32GB version of the iPhone 6, meaning these are new devices being manufactured specifically for specific Asian carriers as entry-level devices. According to the report, the new model is expected to launch on Taiwan Mobile on March 10, and has apparently been quietly available in China for the past few weeks. Notably, this new 2017 iPhone 6 model will only be available through select carriers, not on Apple’s online store or in its retail stores. Taiwan Mobile is currently advertising the devices as part of a special limited-edition promotion as the most inexpensive iPhone the company has ever offered — it’s basically being given away for free with a 30-month contract plan. It’s unclear if it may come to other Taiwanese carriers or remain exclusive to Taiwan Mobile; it’s presently also being sold by one carrier in China. It’s very unlikely that the “new” model will extend beyond China, however.

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Microsoft takes back market share in the education sector with low-cost 2-in-1s as Macs and iPads fade 0 by Michael Allison  @Mkeallison Mar 3, 2017 at 17:00 GMT4 days ago Despite the initial popularity of MacBooks and iPads as educational tools and Apple’s long history in the educational segment, there are some indications that Apple’s devices are no longer the preferred tool for educators. A study done by FutureSource found that – especially in the US – iOS and MacOS devices are in decline as the primary tools of educators. The major factors? The price and keyboards.While iPads have their value in helping educate younger students in kindergarten and the lower classes, as students progress, there is often a need for the older students to be able to turn in typed work like essays and creative pieces which are best done using an old fashioned keyboard and mouse interface. However, for the price of one decently specced Macbook, administrators can often pick up several cheap laptops and Chromebooks with little hassle and hand them out to students for little cost. In the case of Chromebooks and Office 365 equipped PCs, students can even save their work online and be able to login to other PCs and pick up where they left up easily. The New York times reports that one school administrator noted that he could purchase three Chromebooks for the price of one Laptop, making it a no-brainer to purchase those devices in lieu of Apple’s efforts. While Chromebooks have strong support in USA, this is mainly due to a specific online testing environment which does not exist in other markets. Apple CEO Tim Cook famously called Chromebooks “test machines”, referring to schools’ need for cheap devices for mass computerised testing purposes rather than actual education. While Chromebooks dominated education in USA, the story is dramatically different in the rest of the world, which is about half of the total mobile education market. FutureSource reports that outside of the US market, Microsoft remains a dominant market leader with a strong position in both developed and emerging markets. Microsoft is gaining share against Android, especially in large scale emerging market deals. Around 13.6 million mobile education devices (desktops excluded) shipped to the rest of the world in 2017, with this number expected to reach 15.8 million in 2017. 12.6 million unit devices shipped in USA in 2016. Even worldwide Chromebooks are a growing presence, growing from 2% in 2014 to 6% in 2016, and even topping the markets in Sweden in 2016. Microsoft has been sharpening its offerings, with services such as Intune for the classroom,  ‘Microsoft Classroom’, ‘School Data sSync’ and supporting low-cost laptops for school, such as the Acer Tracelmate Spin b1 and Lenovo N24 convertible. Some devices will hit price points as low as $189, neutering a significant advantage Chromebooks offer. FutureSource notes that 2-in-1 devices are the platform of the future, with Microsoft offering a wide range of 2-in-1 products designed specifically for education. “PC provider’s laser focus on the education sector is good news for schools and students. 2017 will see wide ranges of computing devices, designed specifically for education and at competitive price points, entering the market and vying to be the device of choice for learning,” noted Mike Fisher, Associate Director of Education at Futuresource Consulting.

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez, File) Apple stops buying cobalt from Congo as child labor persists Fri Mar 3rd, 2017 9:08am Business You must sign in or register to continue reading content. By Todd C. Frankel / The Washington Post Apple said it has temporarily stopped buying cobalt mined by hand in Congo after a recent investigation by British broadcaster Sky News, which found continuing problems with child labor and harsh work conditions. The change comes several months after Apple said it planned to keep buying so-called “artisanal” cobalt from Congo while it worked to address the problems. Cobalt is essential for the lithium-ion batteries found in laptops and smartphones, such as the iPhone. Sixty percent of the world’s cobalt supply comes from Congo. A Washington Post investigation last year detailed abuses in Congo’s artisanal cobalt supply chain, showing how miners — including children — labored in hazardous, even deadly, conditions. Amnesty International and other human rights groups also have alleged problems. The Post connected this troubling trade to Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt Company, a Chinese firm that is the largest buyer of artisanal cobalt in Congo and whose minerals are used in Apple products. Apple responded by pledging to clean up its cobalt supply chain, but the tech giant said it wanted to avoid hurting the Congolese miners by cutting them off. That plan appears to have changed. In a response to Sky’s revelations that the problems identified earlier were still prevalent, Apple said it has stopped buying cobalt from artisanal mines. “We have been working with Huayou on a program that will verify individual artisanal mines, according to our standards,” Apple said in a statement, “and these mines will re-enter our supply chain when we are confident that the appropriate protections are in place.” Apple has said it intends to begin this year scrutinizing its cobalt suppliers like it does its “conflict mineral” suppliers — the tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold from Congo that companies are required by securities law to attempt to certify does not come from militia-controlled mines. Apple said it plans to publish a list of the cobalt smelters, just as it does for its conflict mineral smelters. Sky News reported that children continued to be employed in the cobalt mining that feeds into Apple’s supply chain. The report was centered on the former Katanga province of Congo, where Huayou Cobalt operates, although the Sky News report does not specify the locations. A Huayou Cobalt spokesman told The Post that it was investigating the allegations made in Sky News story and had asked the broadcaster for more details.   Most Read Julie Muhlstein Everett native sailing solo around the world Andy Stephens was a young Coast Guard veteran, college student and sailboat… Mar 6th, 2017 by Julie Muhlstein Snohomish County in dispute with landowner over condemned property LYNNWOOD — A dispute over a road-widening project has left a property… Mar 6th, 2017 by Noah Haglund Bothell’s new high school is modeled on the best in the world BOTHELL — Eric McDowell is a high school principal without students.

We explain all you need to know about the iPhone SE, and look to the future: When is the iPhone SE 2 coming out? The 4in iPhone SE is rumoured to be updated in 2017, possibly adding 128GB of storage to the small smartphone. By Marie Brewis | 03 Mar 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on PC Advisor and thought you should see it too. Comments The iPhone SE went on sale on 31 March 2016, and since the iPhone 7's launch it has been the only 4in iPhone you can buy new direct from Apple. We explain all you need to know about the iPhone SE, and look to the future: When is the iPhone SE 2 coming out? Also see: iPhone SE review iPhone SE UK release date: When is the new iPhone SE coming out? iPhone SE UK release date: 31 March 2016 iPhone SE 2 UK release date: March 2017 (TBC) The iPhone SE costs £379 with 16GB of storage (up £20 since its launch), or £429 with 64GB of storage, and is available in Silver, Gold, Space Grey and Rose Gold. That's cheap for an iPhone, admittedly, but still pretty pricey when you consider that an iPhone SE costs only $160 to make. Many people have speculated that Apple will announce the successor to the iPhone SE, the iPhone SE 2, approximately one year after its launch in March 2017, as is the case with its flagship iPhone updates. Until now, it seemed the iPhone SE would follow in the footsteps of the iPhone 5C as a potential one-off, with trusted analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities stating that no new iPhone SE will arrive in 2017 (via Pocket-Lint). According to Kuo, this is because the launch of a new iPhone SE will impact iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus sales, which are already down. However, a new report from Mac Otakara says that a source claims there will be an update to the original phone. Whether it gets any upgrades beyond the rumoured increase to 128GB storage is unknown, but the report also states that we'll see new iPads at an Apple launch in March. Following the report from Mac Otakara, MacRumours claims that US retailer Target has been ordered to return a number of unsold iPhone SE models to Apple by 1 March 2017, only weeks before the rumoured announcement of the second-generation iPhone SE. The list of phones includes six 16- and 64GB SE models in Gold, Silver, Rose Gold and Space Grey, along with two Sprint models.  Of course, there are other reasons as to why Target is returning the stock - bad sales, for example - but it seems, to both us and Macrumours, that the timing is a little too coincidental. While we assume a 128GB iPhone SE 2 will make an appearance at the rumoured March event, we've only got a few weeks left until we know for sure.  See also: iPad Air 3 release date, price and specs rumours. Best places to buy iPhone SE in the UK: Where to buy iPhone SE You can buy the iPhone SE direct from Apple now. It’s available in Silver, Gold, Space Grey and Rose Gold. The 16GB option is £379 while the larger 64GB option is £429. If you buy direct from Apple, the phone will come unlocked so you can use it on any UK network. EE says all handsets bought from EE direct channels will support EE’s WiFi Calling service and 4G Calling (VoLTE), and you can order it here. Vodafone says customers who opt for the iPhone SE on Vodafone’s ultrafast 4G network can also enjoy Vodafone’s Data Test Drive for the first two months of their contract, meaning they can get to grips with their new iPhone SE without any limitations on their UK data usage. Furthermore, Vodafone’s Wi-Fi Calling service will be available on the iPhone SE, making it possible to stay connected anywhere there is Wi-Fi – from a basement flat to the London Underground. Order here. O2 is offering the iPhone SE on multiple contract plans here. Three is offering the iPhone SE on several pay monthly plans, including a massive 30GB per month. View all the plans here. It also points out that those who buy the iPhone SE from them will benefit from its Feel At Home policy (no roaming charges in selected countries), 4G at no extra cost, and a six-month free Deezer subscription. Carphone Warehouse allows you to order here, while you can do the same at Mobiles.co.uk here. You can also buy official accessories for the iPhone SE including leather cases in black and midnight blue (£29 inc VAT), and Lightning Docks in colour-matched metallic finishes for £39 inc VAT, both from Apple’s retail stores and Apple.com/uk. iPhone SE new features and specification: What's new in the iPhone SE? The iPhone SE looks very much like an iPhone 5s with the familia 4in Retina (326ppi) display, but with a new rose gold option, matt chamfered edges and a stainless steel Apple logo. On the inside, though, it's very much a smaller iPhone 6s and, according to Apple, it's the most powerful 4in phone ever. With the same 64-bit Apple A9 processor and M9 motion co-processor as the iPhone 6s, the iPhone SE is twice as fast as the iPhone 5s on raw performance, and three times as fast for graphics. And that's not all that's fast. With the addition of 802.11ac Wi-Fi the iPhone SE can support download speeds up to 433Mbps. It also supports faster 150Mbps LTE with more bands, plus Wi-Fi calling.  There have also been some improvements to battery life, with the iPhone SE beating the iPhone 5s' runtime for audio (50 hours vs 40 hours), video (13 hours vs 10 hours), Wi-Fi- and LTE browsing (13 hours vs 10 hours), and 3G talk time (14 hours vs 10 hours). With a new NFC chip inside and the Touch ID fingerprint scanner the iPhone SE also supports Apple Pay for making mobile payments. Read more about how you can take advantage of this in our Apple Pay guide. In common with its bigger brother, the SE features a 12Mp iSight camera with Focus Pixels and a True Tone flash. There's a new image signal processor and support for 4K video recording and panoramic images up to 63Mp, plus Apple's Live Photo feature. The photo below will give you some idea of what the iPhone SE's camera is capable of. At the front the iPhone SE has a Facetime HD camera with a new Retina Flash, that lights up the screen three times brighter for taking the ultimate selfie. The iPhone SE runs the new iOS 9.3 operating system. iPhone SE performance benchmarks: How fast is the iPhone SE? We should make it clear that we have not yet benchmarked the iPhone SE. However, it has the same hardware as the iPhone 6s, and according to Apple should perform the same (therefore we assume the iPhone SE must have 2GB of RAM like the 6s, although Apple has not confirmed this). Below are our benchmark results from our iPhone 6s review. The iPhone 6s scored 2511 in single-core mode and 4404 in multi-core mode in Geekbench, putting it just behind the processing power of the Galaxy S6, which scored 4438 points. It beat the HTC One M9 by a whopping 626 points, scoring 3778 points, which would normally be an acceptable score. However, it’s in the graphics department that the iPhone 6s really flexes its muscles. We ran two GFXBench tests – T-Rex and Manhattan, the same tests that our colleagues use when testing Android devices, and compared the results. Samsung’s Galaxy S6 managed a respectable 30fps in T-Rex and 14fps in Manhattan, while the iPhone 6s scored a whopping 59fps in T-Rex and 56fps in Manhattan. iPhone SE full specifications: What’s inside the iPhone SE?

Skip to content Naked Security Computer Security News, Advice and Research sophos.com Free Tools Go Award-winning computer security news Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Feed Apple pushing two-factor authentication for iOS 10.3 users 03 Mar 2017 0 2-factor Authentication, iOS Post navigation Previous: Researcher uses Google’s speech tools to skewer Google reCAPTCHA Next: Secrets of the Filecode ransomware revealed by Maria Varmazis 0Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Beta users of Apple iOS 10.3 are reporting that they’re receiving push notifications from Apple to enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for their Apple IDs, which is used on Apple devices (like iPads, iPhones and Macs) to synchronize and share iCloud user data. Apple’s 2FA provides an extra layer of security for iCloud data as well as for devices registered to an Apple ID, and it seems with iOS 10.3 that Apple is taking stronger measures to encourage its users to enable this feature. Two-factor authentication isn’t new on iDevices, as it has been available for well over a year since iOS9 and OS X El Capitan – notably, the feature became available first for iCloud after a spate of celebrity iCloud hacking incidents, and then more broadly to secure Apple devices soon after. Sophos Home Free home computer security software for all the family Learn More Until iOS 10.3 leaves beta, you may not get the notification from Apple to enable 2FA, but the good news is that as long as your device fits the system requirements, you don’t need to wait for Apple’s friendly reminders. Here’s how you can enable 2FA on your iPhone right now (if you are running iOS 9 or later): Tap the “Settings” app Scroll down and tap “iCloud” (assuming you are logged in with your Apple iCloud ID already) Tap your Apple ID, which will appear at the top of the screen On the next screen, tap “Password & Security” In the middle of the screen, you will see “Two-Factor Authentication,” likely already set to “Off.” Tap “Turn on Two-Factor Authentication” and follow the prompts to set up 2FA for your device. You may be asked to verify your identity by answering security questions and confirming the credit card details you have on file tied to your Apple ID. Note: If you do not have a passcode set up on your mobile device, you will be prompted to create one before you can enable 2FA.

Skip to content 512 Pixels About Projects Sponsor Book → RSS → Review: 27-inch iMac with 5K Retina display  March 3, 2017 ⌘ Permalink My years of a Mac user can be broken into three main eras: The Early Days: A string of PowerBooks and MacBook Pros with work and personal data on them. The Great Divide: An iMac at home and a laptop at work.1 Giving Up: Using a work laptop for everything again with a Mac mini as a home server. I’ve been lucky that every job I’ve had after leaving the Apple Store in 2008 has provided me with a Mac notebook to use as I see fit. This was the case in 2014 when Myke and I started Relay FM. I had a work-issued MacBook Air that I used for work and personal stuff, but I soon felt weird about using this computer to work on my new company, so I picked up a MacBook Pro with Retina display. This is the computer I was using for everything until October of last year. We’ve had a Mac mini with a bunch of attached storage on the network for years, but all of my work was taking place on this notebook. For the first year or so of independent life, I was working from home most of the time, but recorded shows at my brother’s office. My MacBook Pro would go with me, and dock with an external display, keyboard and mouse at each location. This setup was less than ideal, and when we moved last summer, I was lucky enough to have studio space at home for the first time. Suddenly, my portable machine found itself docked for weeks at a time. As it was a 15-inch model, when I did have to take it somewhere, I quickly became annoyed at the size and weight. So I bought my first iMac in years. Buying Refurbished I picked up a refurbished Late 2015 27-inch iMac with 5K Retina display with the following specs: 3.3GHz quad-core Intel Core i5 processor 16 GB RAM 1 TB SSD AMD Radeon R9 M395 graphics card with 2 GB video RAM Retina 5K 5120-by-2880 P3 (wide color) display If I had ordered this configuration from Apple, it would have cost $3,099. Refurbished, it set me back $2,719. This isn’t my first refurbished Mac. While the options aren’t always great (I really wanted an i7), it’s a nice way to save a chunk of change. After AppleCare and tax, I still spent less than just the machine would have cost otherwise. The discounts vary over time, but the fact that Apple warranties these machines as new sets me at ease. This iMac — like the other refurbished computers I’ve purchased — was indistinguishable from a new one when it arrived. You aren’t going to be stuck scraping off someone else’s stickers if you go this route. (Yes, that is an iMac base made of a Time Capsule and first-generation Apple TV.) Upgrades & Performance I spend a lot of time in professional applications like Logic Pro X2 and Final Cut Pro X, so I knew I would want to max out the RAM when I got the iMac. For some reason I cannot comprehend or accept, the 21.5-inch iMac does not come with upgradeable RAM. Mercifully, the 27-inch model still does, so I picked up another 16 GB of RAM from MacSales. Installation was straightforward; you don’t need to be an ex-Genius to follow Apple’s directions. Despite getting a model with an i5, this machine has taken everything I’ve thrown at in stride. Of course, much of this has to do with the SSD. Unlike a Fusion Drive, it’s always fast, and while the 1TB option was crazy expensive, I haven’t regretted the choice. In short, everything is buttery smooth on this iMac all the time. That All in One Life At this writing, my iMac is the most up-to-date model. As such, it has a bunch of I/O that future models may not: 3.5 mm headphone jack SDXC card slot Four USB 3 ports Two Thunderbolt 2 ports Gigabit Ethernet In addition to Ethernet, I usually have at least one Thunderbolt port in use, as well as all most of the USB ports. I wouldn’t mind more USB ports, actually. I have USB 3 hub mounted under my desk for a few additional peripherals that I never unplug, like my Time Machine drive. Keeping one USB port empty on the iMac makes swapping things around a lot faster. After spending years hooking a notebook up to an external display, I had gotten use to a certain amount of cable clutter. MagSafe, Thunderbolt and USB cables were flopping all over the place. The beauty of the iMac’s iconic design is that all of that mess can be hidden from view. Even as a professional users with several discrete audio devices on my desk, I’m able to keep everything nice and tidy. One thing that has surprised me is how quiet the machine is. Only sustained renders in something like Final Cut ever really make the fans kick up but unless I’m working in perfect silence, I can’t hear them. Likewise, the built-in, downward-firing speakers are surprisingly good. Sure, they lack the punch that external speakers can bring, but for my use as a heavy headphone user, they are perfectly fine. Oh, and this 5K Retina display? Holy moly, it is good. There are downsides to the all in one life, of course. If this iMac ever needs repair, I can’t really do much about it myself. If the guts ever die, I won’t be able to use it as an external display, and I can’t upgrade things any more than I already have. If only Apple made a tower for pro Mac users with easy component access and lots of flexibility… Unseen Benefits I bought this iMac for a bigger reason then wanting a change from my 15-inch MacBook Pro. With the studio, my desk is no longer in the house. I’m not hogging the spare bedroom anymore, and the separation has been good. It’s clear to everyone when I am “at work.” When it’s time to “come home,” I can sleep the iMac, turn off the lights and lock the door behind me. The MacBook Pro I have now can be used for work, but I’ve become so spoiled by the 27-inch display, I really just use it for writing unless I’m traveling. For all intents and purposes, work happens at my desk, on the iMac. That clarity has been good for my kids, my marriage and myself. I’m working far fewer nights than I used to, and when I need to hunker down and get something out the door, I can do so in my own space, without getting in the way. The Future I expect my generation of iMac will be replaced very soon with Kaby Lake-packing, Thunderbolt 3-toting machines, but honestly, I’m fine with it. I don’t have to use any dongles with this machine, and it has so much horsepower, I really think I can get 3-4 years of useful work done with it. When the time does come to replace it, I bet I do so with another iMac. I’m a fan. This interview falls into this era. ↩ I’ve edited several shows over the last few weeks in Adobe Audition and am probably switching, but that’s a story for a different time. ↩ Post navigation ← Previous Post Next Post → New 512 T-shirt!

COURTESY BLOOMBERG Print Comment Tweet Posted: Friday, March 3, 2017 9:28 am By Jeff Green and Emily Chasan Bloomberg News Banking Despite diversity gains, white men still rule R.I. banking social welfare BCBSRI, CVS, Hasbro earn perfect scores on Corporate Equality Index (Dec. 5, 2016) C-Suite Awards Fostering whole life wellness (April 28, 2016) NEW YORK - Slowly but steadily, investors continue to let corporate boards know that "male, pale and stale" doesn’t cut it anymore. The small but growing number of shareholder votes on diversity proposals is on pace to match or exceed the record set last year, according to data compiled by ISS Analytics, which tracks proxies. Apple and Tyson Foods investors already rejected such proposals, and another eight are in the queue. The $309.7 billion California Public Employees’ Retirement System, has made diversity proposals a priority in its proxy voting, aiming to break companies "out of the group think of male, pale and stale," said investment director Anne Simpson. "As evidence grows on this and fund managers focus on building diversity even in their own organizations, I think we’re going to see support on this moving up." In each of the last five years, more than 20 board diversity proposals have been brought to U.S. companies, encouraging some to change their policies and avoid a public referendum. IBM and CVS have already done so this year -- explicitly stating they will consider gender and racial diversity in their board appointments. CVS confirmed the changes. IBM declined to comment. <a href="http://adserver.pbn.com/servlet/click/zone?zid=1&pid=0&lookup=true&position=1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"> <img src="http://adserver.pbn.com/servlet/view/banner/image/zone?zid=1&pid=0&position=1" height="60" width="468" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Click Here!"> </a> A vote doesn’t predict success -- in fact, the opposite. Of the nine proposals that came to a vote last year at companies including Apple Inc., LinkedIn Corp. and Skechers U.S.A. Inc., the only one to pass was at FleetCor Technologies Inc. On average, the proposals earned about 25 percent support, according to ISS. Engagement vs. confrontation BlackRock Advisors Inc. and Vanguard Group Inc., the two biggest funds by assets under management, rarely vote for shareholder proposals on diversity topics. Both firms say they prefer to engage privately with companies. "The vote is but one mechanism we have to message the companies,” said Glenn Booraem, Vanguard’s head of corporate governance. "Our direct engagement with companies has the benefit of being far more nuanced than voting for or against a proposal." Blackrock spokesman Ed Sweeney noted the company’s commitment to various initiatives to raise the number of women in governance and executive leadership. "When we speak with company management and independent directors, we emphasize diversity and inclusion as key components of corporate culture and strategy," he said. Morgan Stanley Investment Management Inc. and T. Rowe Price Associates Inc., on the other hand, vote for diversity proposals far more often. Morgan Stanley had no comment other than to refer to it’s proxy voting policy that says it considers such proposal on a case-by-base basis. "We tend to support most of these proposals on the rare occasions when we are voting on them," Donna Anderson, vice president and global corporate governance analyst for T.Rowe Price, said in an interview. "We think the business case is pretty strong that bodies with diverse views, including boards, tend to make better decisions than non-diverse groups." Moving the needle At the current pace of gains, women aren’t forecast to hold 50 percent of board seats until 2055. The number of people of color appointed as directors fell in 2016 and the overall rate of minorities serving on boards has been mostly unchanged over the last decade, according to executive recruiter Spencer Stuart. As of now, 13 percent of companies currently give specific details about the race and gender of directors named in their annual filings, said Belen Gomez, senior director of research at Equilar Inc., which tracks diversity disclosure. “The needle is moving, but it’s moving slowly. I do think things are going to ramp up.” NorthStar, based in Boston, filed six proposals this year asking companies to adopt language that they would seek greater board diversity. All six agreed to add specific wording, and the fund withdrew the proposals, said Mari Schwartzer, assistant director of shareholder activism, engagement and social research at the fund. “Companies think that they already have initiatives in place to ensure diversity,” said Ivy Jack, director of equity research at NorthStar Asset Management, which brought the proposals to International Business Machines Corp. and CVS Health Corp. “We look at it and say, ‘even if you have already been doing it, maybe you need to do it differently, or you’re not doing it enough, because your board still does not represent your customers, or just the general population of the country.’" Keywords diversity, Rhode Island, Providence, Woonsocket, CVS Print Comment Tweet Comments No comments on this story | Please log in to comment by clicking here Please log in or register to add your comment Related Stories Banking Despite diversity gains, white men still rule R.I. banking social welfare BCBSRI, CVS, Hasbro earn perfect scores on Corporate Equality Index (Dec. 5, 2016) C-Suite Awards Fostering whole life wellness (April 28, 2016) Popular Most Read 1.

Tech Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies TV Politics Business MWC 2017     Analyst Says 2017 IPhone Models To Get Lightning And USB-C Fast Charge Posted: Mar 3 2017, 5:55am CST | by Shane McGlaun, in Rumors | Apple     Apple won't ditch the Lightning connector according to analyst Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo from KGI Securities has issued a research note to investors that indicates something interesting is expected for all three of the iPhone models expected to launch this year. According to Kuo, all three of the smartphones expected in 2017 will maintain the Apple Lightning connector but all three will also get the ability to use USB-C ports for power delivery. Don't Miss: MWC 2017 Highlights Those USB-C ports will allow faster charging and Kuo says that one challenge for Apple lies in being sure that the smartphones are safe and stable during data transmission. Kuo wrote in the research note: "New 2H17 models may all support fast charging. We believe all three new iPhones launching in 2H17 will support fast charging by the adoption of Type-C Power Delivery technology (while still retaining the Lightning port). A key technical challenge lies with ensuring product safety and stable data transmission during a fast charge. In order to achieve that goal, we think Apple will adopt TI's power management and Cypress's Power Delivery chip solutions for the new iPhone models. We note the OLED version may have a faster charging speed thanks to a 2-cell L shaped battery pack design." Kuo thinks that the USB-C high-speed data transfer is still a niche application for the iPhones. The analyst also thinks that Apple will maintain the Lightning connector to keep licensing income from the MFi program for accessories that use Lightning connectivity.

Tech Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies TV Politics Business MWC 2017     IPhone SE Refresh Not Expected In First Half Of 2017 Posted: Mar 3 2017, 6:17am CST | by Shane McGlaun, in Rumors | Apple     Sales decline predicted during the first half of 2017 Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo from KGI Securities has published a research note recently that talks about the iPhone SE smartphone. According to Kuo, Apple won't refresh the iPhone SE in the first half of 2017. This is due to Apple wanting to maintain higher margins on high-end iPhone models according to Kuo. Don't Miss: Win a Free Nintendo NES Classic in our Giveaway The note also expects that total shipments of iPhones will decline in the first half of 2017 due to slow demand in China, reduced shipments off 4.7-inch iPhone's and the lacks of a refresh or the iPhone SE in the second quarter of 2017. Kuo expects that Apple will put pressure on its suppliers to cut prices for components to allow it to maintain margins on iPhone models. Price reductions aren't expected to kick in until November or December of 2017. Kuo does note that he doesn't expect all suppliers to cut prices on iPhone components. Suppliers like Samsung making the chips for the iPhone have a better position to bargain with Apple over costs, Kuo thinks that Samsung might even raise prices. Kuo expects shipments of iPhone models in Q2 2017 to be in the 35 to 40 million units range. While Kuo isn't expecting an update for the iPhone SE in the first half of 2017, that isn't stopping rumors about an imminent refresh from swirling. One source of those rumors is a report that has surfaced claiming that retailer Target has returned iPhone SE stock ahead of the March Appel event that is rumored. Target returned iPhone SE unlocked 16GB and 64GB models in gold, silver, rose gold, and space gray colors. A pair of Sprint models were also returned. The return of the devices could have been linked to poor sales of the models, but the returns come right on the heels of the rumored March Apple event leading some to speculate Target might know of a new model coming.

Until March 14, Apple is offering consumers the opportunity to snap up a new device and pay for it over the course of 12 months without spending a penny in interest. The catch? There isn’t one! Well, apart from the fact that you have to spend at least £399 to qualify – but that won’t be a problem in the Apple Store. What does it cost per month? This 0% finance offer covers almost every one of Apple’s products, except most of the Apple Watch 2 models. Getting a new iPhone 7 costs as little as £58.25 per month for the 128GB version that usually retails at £699. Meanwhile, the top-of-the-range iPhone 7 Plus (256GB) is £76.58 per month. For an iPad Pro 12.9-inch that possesses 128GB of storage, it costs £819 usually, but under the 0% finance offer it comes in at £68.25 a month. To get your hands on one of the newest MacBook Pro models, be prepared to spend considerably more. The basic 13-inch laptop that costs £1,449 is £120.75 per month. However, the cheapest one doesn’t come with Apple’s latest feature: the Touch Bar. To get that you need to get the next model up, which is priced at £1,745 and is a big £145.74 per month for the year. To take advantage of the offer, selecting "Financing" at the checkout and go through the required steps. If you pass the credit check then you're away. Whilst the 0% offer doesn’t actually save you any money, it’s far nicer to spread the cost over a 12-month period. Frankly, taking a £1,000+ hit from Apple never felt better.

Originally released in 2014, Apple has launched a new 32GB configuration for the device. It is technically new because the iPhone 6 originally debuted in 16/64/128GB configurations and has never gotten a 32GB SKU. The 32GB iPhone 6 will be launching with select Asian carriers as the low-end model and will not be available through Apple retail. It will be available on Taiwan Mobile on March 10 and has quietly available in China since late February. Apple will not be selling the 32GB iPhone 6, which is only available in gold, on its website or in Apple retail stores. It will continue to sell the iPhone SE as the low-end model which has better internals but lacks a larger display. While Apple has been quiet about the situation, Taiwan Mobile is advertising it as a ‘new’ special edition model. The carrier says that this is the cheapest iPhone yet and is already accepting pre-orders. They will be selling the device for ‘free’ with a NT$1,399/month contract plan (which equates to around $45 US). Tags: iPhone 6 About Peter Cao Peter has a passion for music and technology. He conceits himself by religiously rocking the Apple brand. You can find him on Twitter @iPeterCao.

This time around, Sinfiled took the time to edit a longer birds-eye overview of Apple Park, which opens in April. Sinfield’s video arrives a week following Roberts’ aerial clip of Apple’s massive new office building. Running four minutes and six seconds long, filmed using DJI’s Inspire 1 Pro drone and put together using dynamic editing techniques, the video shows off the stunning progress made on the main 280,000 sq ft ring-shaped building which is set to accommodate over 13,000 employees, as well as a new research and development building and many other impressive details. The video gives us a closer look at the solar panels, which are still being installed on the main building’s roof. We can also see the nearly completed solar panel installations on the rooftops of vehicle garages. The entire building will be powered by 100 percent renewable energy. 75 percent of total power requirements will be delivered via a micro-grid installation capable of producing 17 megawatts of power from solar alone, with Bloom Energy-provided fuel cells similar to those installed at the North Carolina data center providing the rest of the power needed to operate the facilities. Enjoy Sinfield’s March 2017 Apple Park update in the video below. Apple continues to plant trees, including drought-resistant trees in the center of the main building. Landscaping work at the maintenance facility is now visible, too. At the moment, the most polished facility is the secure research and development building.

The 30-second spots, narrated by Beats 1 radio host Julie Adenuga, were aired during The BRIT Awards for pop music in the United Kingdom on February 22. The ads are in line with a report that said Apple is shifting its focus towards regional marketing campaigns. Apple Music has over 20 million subscribers, which still trails market leader Spotify, which yesterday revealed it has 50 million paying subscribers. Apple Music launched around the world in June 2015.

Read the latest rumours about the 2017 iPhone specs, price and UK launch date, celebrating 10 years of the iPhone. 10 years of iPhone mean one thing: the iPhone 8 should be the best iPhone update yet By Chris Martin | 03 Mar 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on PC Advisor and thought you should see it too. Comments The iPhone 7 has only been on sale for a while, but all we seem to be hearing are rumours about the iPhone 8. We think Apple might well be holding back some major updates and improvements for the iPhone 8, which - if the rumours are true - will be launched on the 10th anniverary of the first iPhone. Here we round up the rumours about the iPhone 8 release date, price, features and specifications. See also: Best phones 2016. Hang on a minute, shouldn't the next iPhone be the iPhone 7s? It still could be. Leaks and more rumours are pointing to not one but three new iPhones, two of which may well be branded as iPhone 7s and 7s Plus models. The main launch, though, would be the flagship, 10th anniversary iPhone '8'. We'd be surprised if Apple goes for that naming convention, however, and other rumours say it  could even be called simply 'The iPhone', or iPhone Pro, but for now we'll stick to calling it the iPhone 8 for simplicity. Update 3 March: A new report from analysts at TrendForce - and another from AppleInsider - says that the iPhone 8 won't have two heavily rumoured features: wireless charging and a screen with curved edges. Based on information from the iPhone supply chain, TrendForce said, "Apple will not implement the curved display design for the high-end iPhone because there are issues with the 3D glass in terms of production yield and drop test results. Thus, the next high-end iPhone is expected to have the same 2.5D glass for display cover as the current models.". On wireless charging, AppleInsider obtained information from Cowen and Company which reckons that the long-range wireless charging system which Apple is working on won't feature in the iPhone 8. What's more likely - as  detailed below - is that the phone will use a similar system to current phones that support Qi wireless charging. This means you'll have to put the phone on a charger, just as with the Apple Watch. The third new piece of news is that KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo refutes other reports saying Apple will use USB-C instead of Lightning on the iPhone 8 in order to introduce fast charging. Via TechTimes, he says that Apple will make a few power-management tweaks to enable the battery to be charged faster when using a Lightning cable. Here's a summary of what to expect from the iPhone 8: iOS 11 software 5.8in edge-to-edge screen with no bezels and no physical home button 3D front-facing camera could replace Touch ID Long-range wireless charging - may not come until 2018 Apple A11 processor 64- or 256GB with 3GB RAM Latest Intel LTE modem Possible change in case material to glass or ceramic - or just glass back That's the main specs covered, but here are the other rumours: The main logic board will be in two pieces instead of the traditional one Apple may move the SIM tray to the bottom edge (this could be to allow room for other internal components or to include a Smart Connector) Quick charging will be supported when using a cable New speaker design could make the phone the thinnest ever It will use an OLED screen from Samsung - read more. Facial recognition in addition to fingerprint scanner Laser sensor for gesture recognition - read more. The latest video from ConceptsiPhone does a decent job of showing what the iPhone 8 might look like. It's interesting to see an idea of how the bottom of the display might be used, similar to the Touch Bar on the MacBook Pro. Find the best Apple deals. When is the iPhone 8 UK release date? iPhone 8 UK release date: September 2017 (TBC) Although still months away, we can fairly confidently predict the iPhone 8 release date. Assuming the annual September announcement tradition continues, the iPhone 8 release date will be in September 2017. However, 2017 marks the 10th anniversary of the original iPhone launch, so we wouldn't be too surprised if Apple mixed things up a bit (it launched the SE - pictured below - in March). According to Tech Trader Daily (via MacRumours), Apple might be putting the iPhone 8 into production in June, sooner than expected. However, that doesn't necessarily mean the launch will be earlier than September given the potentially radical design change. It's not necessarily going to be called the iPhone 8, of course, but that's the name we're using to keep things simple. What will the 2017 be called? It seems the name may have been confirmed with an Apple employee referring to the new device by the name 'iPhone 8' unprompted when speaking to Business Insider. However, there is another suggestion as Apple Insider claims that Apple could call this year's iPhone the iPhone X. As we've mentioned, the iPhone for 2017 is slightly harder to predict because it will mark a big anniversary for the smartphone. The latest rumours are that Apple will release three new iPhone models as part of the main lineup. This could well be the 'S' versions of the 7 and 7 Plus, and the extra 'iPhone 8', an even more premium flagship with 'revolutionary' features. The Wall Street Journal says: "Apple plans bigger design changes for 2017, the 10th anniversary of the original iPhone. Those changes could include an edge-to-edge organic light-emitting diode, or OLED, screen and eliminating the home button by building the fingerprint sensor into the display, according to people familiar with the matter. "At a meeting with an Apple executive, one of the company’s China-based engineers asked why this year’s model [the iPhone 7] lacked a major design change in keeping with Apple’s usual two-year cycle. The answer, one person at the meeting recalled, was that the new technology in the pipeline will take time to implement. People familiar with the matter said some features that Apple hopes to integrate into iPhones, such as curved screens, weren’t ready for this year’s models," it added. If Apple follows the usual pattern, the iPhone 7 that launched this year will be followed by the iPhone 7S in 2017. The fact that it's 10 years since the original iPhone means this could all go out the window. Apple will want to do something special to celebrate the occasion so an 'S' model, which usually just brings small tweaks, won't suffice. It's pretty much anyone's guess at the moment, hence, we're calling the 2017 model the iPhone 8 at the moment but it's perfectly plausible that the new phone won't conform to the traditional naming system at all. The iPhone SE (special edition) is already a thing, so perhaps Apple will go with 'iPhone Pro', iPhone Anniversary Edition' or even just 'iPhone' - although naming the iPad 3 as 'the new iPad' didn't go down too well. A report from Nikkei suggested that in 2017 there would be three new iPhone models. It sounded as though we were in for the usual 4.7- and 5.5in models (the regular and Plus), plus a third new 'Pro' model with a 5.5in or above curved screen. Its source said the screen would be "bent on the two sides" making it sound like a Galaxy Note 7 rival. Of course, this didn't happen with the iPhone 7, though it doesn't mean we won't see a curved-screen iPhone 8. Vote in our poll to let us know what you think Apple will name the anniversary iPhone. How much will the iPhone 8 cost in the UK? We're speculating for now, of course, as the iPhone 7 has only recently gone on sale. Whether Apple will introduce a price increase for the potentially special iPhone 8 is anyone's guess. However, the iPhone 7 price jumped up to £599 in the UK thanks to Brexit and we hope that it will stay the same with next year's anniversary model. However, in light of the latest leaks, the 'anniversary' model seems to be an ultra-premium device that could cost more than any iPhone yet. At least one report claims it will be more than $1000 in the US.  Although one analyst predicts the iPhone 8 will be the best selling model ever - with up to 150m sales - another is worried that following the anniversary edition, Apple will see a possible 10 year slump afterwards. It is believed that moving to OLED for the iPhone 8 will push up costs as much as $50m for Apple, eating into the firm's profit margin. Whether the firm takes the hit and keeps the price of the phone the same or not remains to be seen. What are the rumoured new features? If Apple does indeed do something special for the iPhone's 10th anniversary, which is ever more likely from all the leaks, the iPhone 8 will be one which fans will no doubt want to upgrade to on launch day. Could we see the biggest queues ever? A combination of design and hardware changes will make the iPhone 8 the most radical new iPhone to date, if we are to go by the rumours and leaks. OLED screen: Will the iPhone 8 feature a next-gen display? It seems certain that the iPhone 8 will have an OLED screen - like the Samsung Galaxy S7 - rather than the traditional IPS tech Apple has used previously.  A recent KGI report says that it will be a 5.8in screen which will fit into a chassis a similar size to the current 4.7in iPhone and that the phone will have a significantly higher capacity battery. Here's a diagram from the report which illustrates how the iPhone 8 will slot into the range: As you can see, the screen will have two parts. A 5.15in 'main' screen with a resolution of 2,436 x 1,125 pixels and a separate 'function area' across the bottom. This is likely to be where the integrated fingerprint scanner will live, and it may operate like the Touch Bar on the latest MacBook Pro laptops. Whatever turns out to be the case, the screens are coming from Samsung. The Korean Herald reported that a source confirmed the order from Samsung and that - like the screen on the Galaxy S7 Edge - it will be made from plastic and not glass. Typically glass is only used for flat screens, so this is not too surprising. And  now according to GSMarena, the deal between Apple and Samsung for the screens is now finalised. The iPhone 8 won't be the first to have a bezel-less screen. Xiaomi has already launched the Mi Mix, reviewed. It's a stunning device and the first of a new category of phones with it's 91.3 percent screen-to-body ratio, according to the firm. A Facebook post by Robert Scoble - a well-known tech strategist - reveals new details about the next iPhone. In the lengthy post Scoble claims to have been told that it will be "a clear piece of glass... which will put holograms on top of the real world like Microsoft HoloLens does". He also says the phone will have an OLED screen and that Apple has 600 engineers working on a next-generation 3D sensor and that the phone will have eye sensors. These will bring "a new kind of interface". He also says that you'll "pop it into a headset which has eye sensors on it, which enables the next iPhone to have a higher apparent frame rate and polygon count than a PC with a Nvidia 1080 card in it." Plus, he says that new sources revealed we can "expect battery and antennas to be hidden around the edges of the screen, which explains how Apple will fit in some of the pieces even while most of the chips that make up a phone are in a pack/strip at the bottom of the phone." These sound like ridiculous predictions, especially the part about the phone being transparent - battery tech is not yet good enough to make one small enough to "hide" - but if true, the iPhone 8 will be a revolution rather than the evolution we've seen with the iPhone 7 this year. We'll continue to update this article as new information appears, but here's how things stand right now. This concept image via ConceptsiPhone shows what an edge-to-edge OLED display iPhone might look like: Glass frame: Will the iPhone 8 feature Gorilla Glass? Jony Ive has wanted to introduce an iPhone which resembles a single sheet of glass for a long time and the 2017 anniversary iPhone could be the one. It's rumoured that at least one iPhone in 2017 will use a glass body, according to Apple supplier Catcher Technology. Glass on the front and back would make it like a hugely updated version of the iPhone 4S. This, combined with the rumour that the iPhone 8 will sport an edge-to-edge OLED screen makes things rather interesting. Allen Horng, chairman and chief executive of Catcher Technology, a key supplier said: "As far as I know, only one [iPhone] model will adopt glass casing next year. I don't think this move will have an impact on Catcher's revenue as glass casing still needs a durable metal frame which requires advanced processing technology and would not be cheaper than the current model." However, don't get your hopes up. Although Foxconn - the manufacturer of iPhones in China - has been experimenting with building a glass chassis for around a year, it is likely too early to put it into mass production. Current tooling is all for aluminium chassis and that's where the expertise and investment is. A switch to glass - or ceramic or some other material - would be such a massive change that there would be far more leaks backing up these rumours. Put simply, we don't believe that the iPhone 8 will be an all-glass machine. Touch ID: Will the iPhone 8 have a home button integrated to the screen? What's much more likely is that the home button will be 'virtual' in the iPhone 8.  This makes sense, and is surely one of the features of the 'function area' in the diagram earlier. But will Apple ditch Touch ID? Previous rumours say no but another new Apple patent for an "Acoustic Imaging System Architecture" suggest otherwise. It's impossible to know what Apple will do, since there are so many patents. One Apple patent shows that the new iPhone's Touch ID fingerprint sensor, which is usually situated beneath the Home button, could be built-in to the entire display, eliminating the need for a Home button and making room for a larger display without enlarging the overall size of the smartphone. These rumours seemed pretty far fetched to begin with, but it might just happen. Sonavation recently announced that it has found a way to insert ultrasonic biometric sensors underneath a Gorilla Glass display, still being able to read a user's fingerprints. The newly developed tech is "well suited for through-the-glass fingerprinting and specifically architected to deliver advanced security  and ease-of-integration into mobile and IoT devices” Sonavation’s CTO Rainer Schmitt said. The company claims that it can even do one better than the existing Touch ID (and most other fingerprint scanners on the market) by being able to scan fingerprints on a finger that's wet, dirty or oily. Though it's not clear which devices will be the first to feature this new technology, but we assume it'd either be the iPhone or a flagship Android smartphone. Another patent has been awarded to Apple for a button which places the fingerprint sensing technology underneath the screen. Named a 'capacitive fingerprint sensor including an electrostatic lens', it means the Touch ID fingerprint sensor can work through various layers of the display.  Yet another patent, via Apple Insider, deals with the light sensor - the one which adjusts the screen brightness automatically. It's called 'Electronic Devices With Display-Integrated Light Sensors' and explains that having a light sensor can result in an increase in the size and weight of the device so "it would therefore be desirable to be able to provide improved electronic devices with light sensors and displays." Face-recognition: Will the iPhone 8 feature a 3D camera? However, Macrumours says that a JP Morgan analyst claims there will be no fingerprint recognition at all, and that Apple will instead embed a front-facing 3D laser scanner that will be able to accurately recognise your face. This will avoid the problem where Touch ID doesn't work if you have wet fingers - or the sensor has water on it. He says it will also be more secure, which could lead to more companies - including banks - supporting Apple Pay. This theory is backed up by Kuo of KGI Securities whose latest report, via 9to5Mac, says Apple will put an enhanced front camera and an IR sensor in order to build up a 3D model of the user's face. The report also says that Apple's 3D algorithms are "years ahead" of Android, and such a feature could be an iPhone exclusive for a couple of years before Android phone makers catch up. As pointed out by Patently Apple, yet more patents suggest a curved-glass design and also that the sides of the phone could be used for virtual buttons. For example, this could be used for certain controls when the camera app is in use. If true, the phone would rival Samsung's edge screen features. There were also some rumours we heard about the iPhone 7's screen that never made it to fruition. It's possible that they could see daylight with the iPhone 8. Economic Daily News speculated that the iPhone 7 could feature a 3D display, and one that doesn't require the use of those annoying 3D glasses. The website claimed at the time that Apple supply chain partner TPK is working on a project that could produce a glasses-free 3D display, though we're not holding out much hope for this as its been done before (remember the LG Optimus 3D?) and has never done well. There were also some rumours to suggest that the iPhone 7 could have a sidewall display, similar to that found on the Galaxy S7 edge and Note 7. This came from an Apple patent that was published in 2015. The patent hints at a future iPhone with a display that extends onto the sides of the device, providing interactive or touch sensitive portions that give access to slide-to-unlock functionality, music player controls, messaging readout, called ID, system controls and more. One of Apple's partners, Japan Display, is working in flexible an foldable screens similar to Samsung and LG. Whether this will end up in the iPhone 8 remains to be seen - it's unlikely but still interesting. Apple has plenty of patents describing bendable and folding devices, according to TechnoBuffalo. More details on the screen tech include that Apple is supposedly working on a new generation of 3D Touch. According to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the firm will make it from a thin film in order to introduce enhanced sensitivity - via AppleInsider.

I wish Apple would make a full-size Magic Keyboard, but that doesn’t seem to be happening any time soon. Thankfully Matias, a computer accessory manufacturer that’s been around since the 90s, is offering its own take on what an Apple-made full-sized wireless keyboard could be like. The end result — the $99 Matias Wireless Aluminum Keyboard — is an impressive rendition of Apple design principles, coupled with a few bonus features that truly make this keyboard worth considering. Have a look at our full video walkthrough for a hands-on look at the Space Gray version of Matias’ Wireless Aluminum Keyboard. The best wireless keyboard for the Mac? Four keyboard color options The Matias Wireless Aluminum Keyboard is available in four colors — Silver, Space Gray, Gold, or Rose Gold — that allows it to complement any color of MacBook or MacBook Pro. The Space Gray and Gold versions feature black key caps, while the Silver and Rose Gold colors feature white key caps. Needless to say, I think that Matias did a great job of nailing the Space Gray version that I’m currently testing, as it matches the 2016 MacBook Pro about as well as one could reasonably expect. I’m assuming that the other three colors are just as good, but I’ve not yet compared them in person. Video walkthrough Subscribe to 9to5Mac on YouTube now Build quality & performance The surface of the keyboard is machined out of aluminum, while the bottom area of the keyboard is plastic. If you’ve used any of Apple’s standalone keyboards recently, then you’ll have a general idea of what to expect here. The keys themselves, while not underpinned by the much-improved butterfly switches that are found on the latest MacBook Pro, feature significantly more key travel, and are relatively stable no matter where you press on a key. I found that I could type fast on this keyboard, and didn’t experience any out of the ordinary key input issues. The keys on the keyboard are not backlit, but Matias is producing two versions with backlighting that are currently available for pre-order (shipping in June). The Backlit Wireless Aluminum Keyboard will come in two colors, and feature a separate battery dedicated to the backlight. The four rubber feet on the bottom of the keyboard do a good job of keeping the keyboard stable on the desk while typing. However, you won’t find any legs on the bottom to adjust the typing angle. Depending on the way you type, this could pose an issue with adjusting to the keyboard’s angle. It’s been a while since I’ve used Apple’s full wired keyboard with number keys, but if memory serves me correctly, the build quality between it and this keyboard is similar. The Apple-built keyboard may be slightly superior in overall build quality, as I did notice a little bit of play on the edges of the Matias hardware when pressed, but no one’s going to do that in real world usage, and that’s probably being overly critical. 1-year battery life The most impressive thing about this keyboard is its battery life. Matias includes a 1,600mAh battery, which it claims is 5x to 12x larger than competing hardware. The result is a keyboard that can be used for a year on a single charge. Included in the box is a USB charging cable, which features a full-size USB-A port on one end, and a right-angle micro USB plug on the opposite end. As much as I hate micro USB, I don’t mind it as much considering that I’ll only need to charge the keyboard once a year. The micro USB port for charging is located on the front of the keyboard, along with the unit’s power button. Charging that keyboard takes around 5 hours, and the Caps Lock key light shines amber while charging. Although there is a power button on the same front panel as the USB port, you’ll rarely need to use it. Once the keyboard is on and paired with your devices, you can leave it that way. Because the keyboard features such a large battery, it stays on and stays connected, which means that there should be no delays on the hardware side of things when you sit down for work. Number pad & full-size arrow keys To anyone who enjoys using full-size keyboards, I don’t have to explain why it’s such a good thing. I don’t have to explain the satisfaction of typing on a full number pad, or having full-size arrow keys to help you navigate. When it comes to a keyboard, having more keys is almost always a better thing in my opinion. But what makes this keyboard special is that it does two things that Apple has quarantined to two separate products. If you want a full-size keyboard in Apple’s world, then you have to live with having a wired connection. But if you want wireless, you have to ditch the number pad, and the rest of the amenities that come with a larger keyboard. With Matias’ offering, you get the best of both worlds. You get a truly wireless keyboard with a long-lasting battery, and you get a number pad, extra function keys, large arrow keys, etc. You aren’t forced to sacrifice one thing for another. Pair up to four devices You’ll notice four curious-looking keys above the number pad on the right-side of the keyboard. These keys are dedicated to paired-devices, and you can pair up to four devices at once with the keyboard. Thus, these dedicated keys make switching between an iPad and MacBook, for instance, a painless affair. You can literally press a single button to switch effortlessly between multiple devices, and it works just as advertised. Matias’ keyboard plays nice with macOS, iOS, Android, and Windows machines. Conclusion The Matias Wireless Aluminum Keyboard is probably the keyboard that Apple should be making. It’s a full-size keyboard with Bluetooth wireless connectivity, which is something that Apple doesn’t offer. If you’re in the market for a good-looking wireless keyboard that features Mac-centric keyboard shortcuts, yet can be easily paired and switched between other devices, then give it a look. You can find the Matias Wireless Keyboard for $95 from B&H Photo Video, but if you prefer to use Amazon, you can also find it there in all four colors.

With reports that Apple is now focusing on an autonomous driving system, is Apple still manufacturing an iCar, and when will the iCar be launched? We look at all the evidence. Latest: Apple pens letter to US transport regulators. by Lewis Painter | 03 Mar 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments Contents Evidence that Apple is working on an iCar Evidence that Apple isn't working on an iCar When will the Apple iCar launch? Driverless or electric? What will the Apple iCar look like? Patents Leaked images Pricing Since February 2015, there have been various reports that Apple is working on a car that will "give Tesla a run for its money" after Business Insider spoke to an Apple employee with knowledge of the subject. This, coupled with sightings of cars registered to Apple, clad with sensors/cameras (which were later debunked), got everyone talking about the prospects of an Apple Car, or iCar. The iCar project is codenamed 'Titan', according to The Wall Street Journal, which originally stated there were "several hundred" Apple employees working on the project. With some reports describing an electric car and others describing a self-driving car, is there any truth to the claim or is it like the Apple TV set everyone was talking about a couple of years ago? Well… Updated with news of a letter penned by Apple to US transport regulators about self-driving cars, and speculation that the project has been given a target of 2017 to "prove feasibility". Evidence that Apple is working on an iCar Here is where we list some of the most prominent rumours suggesting Apple is making an iCar.  Also read: Apple rumours and predictions for 2016. Apple pens letter to US transport regulators about self-driving car rules While many had believed that Apple was stepping away from the autonomous car project, a recent letter penned to US transport regulators by Apple's director of product integrity Steve Kenner may suggest otherwise. Apple has apparently said that it was "excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation" and that there were "significant societal benefits of automated vehicles" to be realised.  An Apple spokesman has confirmed that the letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) was prompted by its "heavy investment in machine learning and autonomous systems" and that it wanted to help define best practises in the industry going forward.  The letter urges regulators to not introduce too many rules regarding the testing of self-driving cars, claiming that "established manufacturers and new entrants should be treated equally". Kenner also suggests that companies should share data from crashes and near-misses to build a more comprehensive picture than would be possible by one company alone, helping to improve the systems.  Of course, with Apple being so focused on user privacy, it'd be out of character not to mention it in the letter. Kenner notes that an individual's privacy should not be compromised by the sharing of data, and that regulators "address privacy challenges associated with the collection, use, and sharing of automated vehicle data".  Apple CEO Tim Cook hints at motoring focus during Q4 2016 results During Apple's Q4 2016 financial results, Apple CEO Tim Cook answered a flurry of questions regarding Apple Pay, Siri and most importantly, the Apple Car. While the CEO neither confirmed or denied the existence of Apple's rumoured electric car, he said that Apple "always looks for ways that we can improve the experience and the customers' experience on different sets of products".  “And we are always looking at new things, and the car space in general is an area that it's clear that there is a lot of technologies that will either become available or will be able to revolutionise the car experience.” he continued. "And so it's interesting from that point of view, but nothing to, certainly nothing to announce today." As usual, Cook is speaking in riddles, but if you read between the lines, it does hint that Apple may have something to announce somewhere down the line.  Apple hires BlackBerry engineers for autonomous car OS project in Canada Bloomberg reports that Apple and its Project Titan team - focusing on an autonomous car OS following the closure of the Apple Car project - have hired a number of former BlackBerry engineers as part of a new Canadian office in Kanata, a suburb of Ottawa. "Many of the engineers working in Canada were hired over the past year and about two dozen came from BlackBerry's QNX, a leading automotive software provider," writes the outlet, citing "people familiar with the matter". Among Apple's hires from QNX is Dan Dodge, the firm's CEO. QNX staff were targeted by Apple because of the company's experience "developing fundamental components of operating systems and power management", an ex-QNX employee told Bloomberg. Apple 'in talks to buy McLaren' According to a report from the Financial Times (paywalled) citing three sources with knowledge of the project, Apple is apparently in talks to buy luxury supercar maker McLaren with the aim of improving its iCar project. What the Financial Times isn't clear about is whether this is a major investment or an outright purchase of the company, stating: "The California technology group, which has been working on a self-driving electric vehicle for more than two years, is considering a full takeover of McLaren or a strategic investment, according to three people briefed on the negotiations who said talks started several months ago." While this may seem strange on the surface, there is logic behind the rumoured buyout. The successor to the hugely popular McLaren P1 is indeed rumoured to be electric, and as well as this, McLaren's Applied Technologies Group supplies electronics to a range of companies, to those within Formula One to NASCAR, and has apparently done an extensive amount of work on data center optimisation, ideal for Apple's self-driving electric car efforts.  Apple 'rethinking strategy on self-driving cars', lays off a number of staff According to a report from the New York Times, Apple is said to be rethinking its self-driving car strategy as other tech giants like Google and even Uber appear ready to start road testing their competing efforts. According to three people briefed on Apple’s move (that aren’t allowed to speak about it publically, of course), the company has laid off dozens of employees working on the project, signalling issues with Apple’s ambitious car project. It’s not the first time that Apple’s car project has been in trouble, as the company had to draft in Bob Mansfield, Apple veteran, in July 2016 to oversee the project and drive it forward as no real progress had been made. Apple is said to have told affected employees that the layoffs were a part of a “reboot” of the project, and of course, Apple has refused to officially make a comment. Autocar report According to a report by Autocar, Apple is planning on aggressively selling the new iCar at a rate of half a million cars per year. This projection is ten times the sales by Tesla - a figure hard to envisage. In the report, Apple is set to change the way the car industry is heading, with radical design changes. It is also rumoured that Apple will have an iCar by 2021 with a fully autonomous car planned to launch by around 2026. Of course, these are all speculations and rumours, so take the report and speculations with a pinch of salt. Supply chain rumours In August 2016, Neil Cybart, the founder of Above Avalon, an analyst firm which concentrates on Apple, mentioned on Twitter the new developments of Apple's supply chain. It is stated that Apple has recently signed an NDA (non-disclosure agreement) with a major South Korean battery developer for cylindrical lithium-ion batteries. This is a strong indication that Apple is looking into electric cars and potentially driverless cars. We will be sure to update this article if we learn of any developments in Apple's supply chain. New roles working at Apple According to the WSJ, Apple has appointed Bob Mansfield (previously Senior Vice President of Technologies at Apple) to work and oversee the Electric Vehicle Team at the company. He previously was set to retire in June 2012, but has been involved in numerous special projects at the company. This further solidifies claims that Apple is committed to releasing their very own iCar, Apple Car or Titan project. It has also been reported by appleinsider that the project is delayed until 2021, a year after its inital rollout. As with all things, take this date prediction with a pinch of salt. Money spent on R&D It has emerged that Apple has spent $10bn in research and development costs, which is more than triple of what it spent just four years ago ($3bn). This massive increase in R&D costs, does suggest that Apple is developing something a lot bigger than simply a new iPhone, iPad or Mac device. Apple's future competitors In a recent interview with the BBC, Ford boss Mark Fields claims that the future rivals of the company may not be the likes of BMW and Audi, but instead tech companies like Google and Apple. Fields went on to explain that Ford's working assumption is that Apple is indeed building a car, and that the assumption provides Ford with "the right motivation to make sure we stay very focused not only on the product but overall on the experience that the customer has interacting with the product and the services that we have." This is following the opening of a new Ford-owned technology business in Palo Alto where employees will be working on autonomous cars that can drive automatically, as well as working with IoT companies to see how people interact with their vehicles. If nothing else, it's an interesting look at what big companies like Ford expect to see on the road within the next five to ten years regardless of Apple's efforts. Apple CEO Tim Cook comments on Apple Car rumours  It takes a lot for the CEO of a company to openly discuss rumours surrounding their own upcoming products, especially when it's the CEO of a secretive company like Apple. However, as unlikely as it seems, Tim Cook has recently teased the media about the possibility of an Apple Car in the future. While he didn't directly comment on the likelihood of an Apple Car, during a recent interview with Fortune, Cook said: "we don’t have to spend large amounts to explore". Apparently, Apple becomes "committed" to a project once the company begins spending huge amounts of money on tools, company acquisitions and other processes (as rumours suggest the company has), although hiring experts don't seem to count. "We explore things with teams of people. And that’s a part of being curious," Cook said. It wasn't the last that Cook had to say about the iCar, either. Only days after speaking to Fortune, Cook teased attendees at an Apple shareholders meeting about future possibilities. "Do you remember when you were a kid, and Christmas Eve... it was so exciting," Cook reportedly said. "You weren't sure what was going to be downstairs. Well, it's going to be Christmas Eve for a while." We'll obviously be waiting some time for an Apple-branded car, but the latest comments from the Apple CEO will definitely add fuel to the fire. 'Engine noises' heard late at night at Apple Car campus If Apple isn't developing a car, this rumour will be pretty hard to explain: AppleInsider has reported that someone who lives near Apple's mysterious campus in Sunnyvale, Calfornia (believed to be where Apple is developing its car) complained about "motor noises" coming from the facility at night.  "[Do] there have to [be] motor noises at 11:00 p.m. at night like last night? Even with the windows closed I could still hear it," the resident reportedly remarked.  However, the resident may be mistaken - construction sounds sound similar to the revving of an engine, especially at a distance. Last year, Sunnyvale issued permits to Apple allowing the company to build a "windowless repair garage" at one of the buildings Apple operates at, so it's possible that is what was heard - although why the construction would take place at night is a mystery.  It's also worth noting that if Apple is building a prototype car at the facility, the noises could be the sound of the lathes and mills required to shape the metal, a notoriously noisy process. Ford exec welcomes Apple to automotive industry The Apple Car is shrouded in mystery, with the only real information we have (if that's what you can call it) is in the form of leaks and rumours, but that hasn't stopped people from forming opinions - in fact, even car company executives are chiming in on the rumours. During an interview with TrustedReviews at CES 2016, Don Butler, Executive Director of Ford Connected Vehicles said that Ford welcomes the competition from Apple and that he thinks that techie companies including Apple and Google "can do it". “We welcome others joining. We welcome the activity that’s in the space. We think it’s exciting. It’s actually changed that we are embracing,” said Butler when discussing the automotive industry. “So I think Apple can do it. I think Google can do it.” While it's far from confirmation that Apple is creating the iCar, it goes to show that if/when Apple does enter the automotive industry, it's presence will be welcomed by the likes of Ford. From the above, it seems as if Ford believes that the likes of Apple and Google can (if they aren't already) change the automotive industry and the way we interact with cars for the better. In an interview with the BBC, Ford boss Mark Fields claims that the future rivals of the company may not be the likes of BMW and Audi, but instead tech companies like Google and Apple. Fields went on to explain that Ford's working assumption is that Apple is indeed building a car, and that the assumption provides Ford with "the right motivation to make sure we stay very focused not only on the product but overall on the experience that the customer has interacting with the product and the services that we have." This is following the opening of a new Ford-owned technology business in Palo Alto where employees will be working on autonomous cars that can drive automatically, as well as working with IoT companies to see how people interact with their vehicles. If nothing else, it's an interesting look at what big companies like Ford expect to see on the road within the next five to ten years regardless of Apple's efforts. Apple buys car-related domain names As first reported by MacRumours, it appears that Apple has bought a number of car-related domain names including apple.car, apple.cars and apple.auto. The purchases took place in December 2015 and were brought to light via Whois, a service that finds information regarding specific domain names and IP addresses. Whois records were updated on January 8 2016 to show that Apple had registered the domains through registrar MarkMonitor Inc, although it’s worth noting that none of the registered domains are currently active. While this may seem like confirmation that Apple is working on an Apple Car, it may not be the case; Apple could be buying the domains for use with Apple’s in-car system, CarPlay. It could also be to stop potential scammers looking to make money from people in light of the recent Apple Car rumours. Although with this being said, Apple bought iCloud.com months before its announcement and that was also picked up by MacRumours. Elon Musk 'confirms' existence of Apple Car in an interview As well as Apple buying car-related domain names, Tesla chief executive Elon Musk recently ‘confirmed’ the existence of Apple’s iCar when speaking to the BBC, claiming that it’s an “open secret” that the company is building a rival car. Musk went on to say that “companies like Apple will probably make a compelling electric car, it seems like the obvious thing to do” and regarding Apple’s privacy, he remarked “It's pretty hard to hide something if you hire over a thousand engineers to do it”. Although he’s fairly confident that Apple is creating a rival car, Musk isn’t worried. When asked if Apple was a threat by a German newspaper, Musk mockingly replied: “Did you ever take a look at the Apple Watch?”. The cheek. New electric car company could be a ‘front’ for Apple The latest reports on the web claim that a new car manufacturer, Faraday Future, could, in fact, be a front for Apple’s rumoured electric car, allowing the company to develop the vehicle without the prying eyes of the media watching them. Faraday Future is a relatively new manufacturer, first appearing on the scene earlier this year as a Tesla competitor – both companies are named after famous scientists, Nikola Tesla and Michael Faraday, and interested in electric vehicles. Though Faraday Future’s plans were initially unclear, the company recently announced that it’d be investing a whopping $1 billion in a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in either California, Georgia, Louisiana or Nevada. The company plans to create an electric vehicle, while it also explores “other aspects of the automotive and technology industries, including unique ownership and usage models, in-vehicle content and autonomous driving”. That’s according to Nick Sampson, senior vice president of Faraday Future, who continued to say "Our range of 100% electric and intelligent vehicles will offer seamless connectivity to the outside world." Very Apple-esque, wouldn’t you agree? So, where is the connection to Apple? First things first, the company claims to have a team of around 400 “automotive and technology experts” along with a number of key employees, including ex-Tesla director of vehicle chassis engineering, Nick Sampson. This matches up with the reports earlier this year claiming that Apple was poaching a number of Tesla staff for its iCar project – but that’s not all. Apple has reportedly just bought a huge amount of land in California, which is claimed to be around twice the size of its new Spaceship campus. Just to put that into perspective, Apple’s spaceship campus and surrounding land measures in at around 2.8 million feet. Now, where did Faraday Future say they’d be investing in a manufacturing facility? Oh… The company has also received a massive $1 billion in funding – a move that’s almost unheard of for a new company, and many suspect that it’s Apple footing the bill. Apple has around $200 billion in the bank, so $1 billion would (as ridiculous as it sounds) be only a drop in the water for the company. The rumours gained more traction when the New York Times reached out for more information on its backers, with Faraday Future claiming that they are “keeping their partners confidential”. Intriguing, right? Well, there’s one more piece to this puzzle… The CEO of the company has not yet been revealed, a move that shrouds this company in mystery. If Faraday Future is a front for Apple’s iCar development, it’d make sense not to announce a CEO; pushing an Apple exec to the position of Faraday Future CEO would immediately give away the company’s plans, possibly years before the launch of its electric car. Of course, nothing has been confirmed or denied, and it does seem like a lot of effort to disguise its own efforts, but it is possible – and if it was going to be any company, it would, of course, be Apple to do it. Apple Car ‘could have digital license plates’ According to website Electrek, Apple’s upcoming iCar could be the first to boast digital license plates. Why? Amongst the horde of employees that Apple has snapped up over the past few months is Rónán Ó Braonáin, ex-Director of Engineering at Reviver, a start-up working on what Braonáin called “the world’s first digital license plate”. According to his LinkedIn, he spent five years as a software engineer at BMW before becoming CTO at Vision Fleet, a company offering electric vehicle fleet management software, before moving onto Reviver and finally ending up at Apple as a “Secret Agent” on “Special Projects”. Digital license plates make sense, especially when you consider vehicle-sharing. The digital license plate could bring forward a new era of vehicle sharing, by giving the government a way to issue plate identifications to the driver of the car, instead of the car itself. Letting a friend drive? Your iCar’s digital license plate would (in theory) automatically update, letting everyone (aka the government) know who’s driving at any particular time. It’s a cool idea, but we’re not sure just how viable it is, especially when you consider that license plates need to be readable in almost any weather conditions, an issue that a digital license plate may struggle with. Steve Jobs ‘considered Apple car’ in 2008 Tony Fadell, former Apple executive, revealed in a recent interview that he and Steve Jobs occasionally talked about what an Apple-manufactured car could look like. The pair would chat informally about various features of the Apple Car and what they’d look like, from the dashboard to the seats to the type of fuel it could be powered by. Although in his follow-up, Fadell stressed that the questions were purely hypothetical and that Apple wasn’t actively developing a car in 2008. Apple execs reportedly liked the idea of building a car, but decided, in the end, to allocate the company’s resources to other products that’d have a bigger impact on consumers around the world – the iPhone, and then three years later, the iPad. However, Fadell did note that cars and iPhones have more in common than meets the eye: “A car has batteries; it has a computer; it has a motor, and it has mechanical structure. If you look at an iPhone, it has all the same things. It even has a motor in it,”. ‘Massive change’ is coming to the auto industry Speaking at Wall Street Journal’s WSJDLive conference at The Montage resort in Laguna Beach, California, Apple CEO Tim Cook said that the automotive industry is close to “massive change” but refused to comment on whether Apple would be a leading part of the change, which Cook predicts will see users move away from internal combustion engines to electrification. “It would seem like there will be massive change in that industry, massive change,” Cook said at the conference. “You may not agree with that. That’s what I think.” This was followed by Cook refusing to respond to reports of Apple developing an electric car looking to be on sale by 2019. He said instead that the company is working to bring the “iPhone experience” to the vehicle via CarPlay, Apple’s in-dash system that allows users to access their iTunes music collections and driving directions without needing to operate phones. Apple 'testing a self-driving car at a War World II naval base' Project Titan is on its way, at least according to the Guardian. The newspaper reports that Apple has already developed its self-driving car, and now it just needs to be tested. Unlike many carmakers - such as Google and Tesla - that are testing their self-driving vehicles on public roads, Apple wants to keep a low profile. That means the company needs some barricaded doors behind which it can test its secretive projects. Apparently Apple has found the perfect top-secret testing base. Back in May, according to the Guardian, Apple's engineers met officials from GoMentum Station, a War World II-epoch disused naval base near San Francisco. The base reportedly hosts 20 miles of everyday public transport scenarios, from highways to cattle grids; its 24-hour surveillance by armed soldiers prevents the public from nosing around the facility. According to GoMentum officials, the base is "the largest secure test facility in the world". However, it's worth mentioning that the leaked report obtained by the Guardian consists of a filed public requests record about the meeting between Apple's team and GoMentum officials. There is no mention of an Apple iCar, and the most revealing clue comes from Apple engineer Frank Fearon, who said: "We would … like to get an understanding of timing and availability for the space, and how we would need to coordinate with other parties who would be using [GoMentum]." BMW negotiations A number of outlets have reported that Apple and the German automaker BMW have been meeting with one another, with Reuters reporting that Tim Cook and other Apple bigwigs visited the BMW production facility in Leipzig. In particular, Apple seems interested in the carbon-fibre-reinforced BMW i3 electric vehicle, reportedly the most energy-efficient car in the US. It's believed that the i3 could form the basis of the rumoured iCar. It's further been claimed that negotiations between Apple and BMW started in autumn 2014 and are approaching a final deal. However, it's worth pointing out that BMW was the first carmaker to incorporate iPod facilities into its vehicles, and that it is entirely possible that Apple is simply looking to secure an agreement with the German company to move its CarPlay project forward. Read more: Apple and BMW started talking about an iCar collaboration last year Hiring car industry veterans Perhaps the clearest sign of Apple's interest in the car industry is the number of new hires it's made from that field. According to the Wall Street Journal, Tim Cook has hired Doug Betts, a veteran of the car industry. Doug Betts has 25 years of experience working for Nissan and Toyota; from 2007 until last year, he was senior vice-president of Global Quality at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. The automobile expert has changed his LinkedIn profile. He describes his current job as "operation-Apple Inc.", which could be interpreted as evidence to back up the WSJ's rumour. On the other hand, this cryptic statement could mean a lot of things.  Since February 2015, Apple seems to have been quietly cherry-picking automobile industry experts - such as Paul Furgale, the Swiss researcher who led the V-Charge project developing self-parking cars. Business Insider's source claims that Tesla employees are "jumping ship" to go and work at Apple. Evidence via LinkedIn supports this claim, with 50 profiles of current Apple employees that have an engineering history at Tesla, mainly through internships. Apple Insider reported that Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said that Apple is trying very hard to get Tesla engineers, offering them a $250k signing bonus and 60 percent pay increase. The Korea Times has reported that Apple is also luring Samsung's tech experts away from them, namely experts in battery technology; perhaps to work on batteries for the iPhone, but also, reports suggest to work on a battery powered electric car. "Some of our personnel have been hired by Apple. They now work at Apple's headquarters in San Jose, Calif.," claimed one anonymous Samsung official, stating that Apple offers competitive benefits and large annual paychecks. If Apple is entering the electric car arena, the company is pretty late to the game and will be looking to file patents. It has already filed a few, as you will see below. "As the electric vehicle business is a new one, Apple needs patents and experts in battery technology. Top human resources firms have been approaching Samsung's battery experts, individually, and I think such human exchange moves are a win-win for both," said the Samsung official. It's easy to write this off as an unconfirmed rumour, but it does fit in with a lawsuit that was filed earlier this month claiming that Apple engaged in an "aggressive campaign" to poach engineers from electric car battery maker A123 Systems. The Register has also reported that Apple is reassigning workers to its car project at such a fast pace that other department leaders are beginning to complain about the loss of talent. Though Project Titan remains shrouded in mystery, reassigning such a number of staff from a variety of departments does point towards work on a significant scale, and possibly a move into a completely new industry.  'Apple cars' spotted There were also rumours surrounding Apple registered vehicles seen driving around the US. The vehicles were clad in sensors, which some assumed enabled the car to drive autonomously like Google’s self-driving car. However, it was too good to be true as Apple announced months after that these were, in fact, mapping vehicles that were being used to improve the Apple Maps service. In fact, the company has even listed all the locations that Apple’s mapping cars will be driving around – possibly to stop any future confusion. If you’re interested (for whatever reason) in seeing Apple’s mapping vehicles in person, head over to the Apple Vehicles page and take a look. More about this rumour below. Secret iCar facility There has also been talk of a secret automobile R&D facility where Apple is recruiting experts to potentially build the iCar. It's apparently run by the ex-head of R&D at Mercedes, Johann Jungwirth, and will be staffed with "experienced managers from its iPhone unit", according to The Times. They carry on to say that the seniority of the executives involved would suggest that an iCar could be in the works. They've also reported that Jony Ive and members of his industrial design team, who are responsible for most of Apples products, have been holding regular meetings with automotive execs and have even tried hiring them. Project Titan team growing According to a recent report from the Wall Street Journal, Apple is taking the iCar project more seriously. Why? Apparently, the company has decided to triple the 600-person strong team to an 1800-person strong team to help reach the iCars all-new 2019 announcement target (see below for more information).  Head over to page 2 for evidence that Apple isn't working on an iCar, along with all rumours discussing the electric vs autonomous debate and a possible release date.  >> Read on… Pages 1 2 3 Tags: Apple , Rumour Share this article Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi.

The post has since been taken down, but initially included the caption: “How did I end up in the studio with Dr Dre ON THE night his deal went public that he did with Apple 3.2 BILLION!!!!! The BEATS HEADPHONES JUST CHANGED HIP HOP!!!!!!” WATCH: The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Financial Times reported the story Thursday citing sources briefed on the talks. Beats by Dre headphones‘ annual sales revenues have reportedly gone up to $1.5 billion since the company was founded with music executive Jimmy Iovine began selling headphones in 2008. The deal would include the new Beats Music streaming service, which Apple is likely acquiring to compete with streaming services like Pandora and Spotify after the company’s iTunes Radio failed to impress the industry. Apple’s revenue growth has declined sharply in recent years, and the company only entered the broadly popular streaming market last year — late because of former CEO Steve Jobs’ reported unfavorable opinion of music subscription services. The company continues to be the largest seller of music downloads, but is losing market share to companies like Amazon. Purchasing Beats would mark Apple’s largest acquisition ever. The headphones retail between about $169.95 to $449.95, depending on model and features, and despite many music and sound industry experts describing their quality as “extraordinarily bad,” the brand has become enormously popular as a fashion item among a younger consumer base, and the popular alternative to standard earbuds models. Beats’ success is due in large part to its wide profit margins – despite the steep prices of the popular bass-heavy headphone models, each individual unit reportedly only costs around $14 to produce. Private equity firm Carlyle Group invested $500 million in Beats last year, and valued the company at more than $1 billion. Neither Apple nor Beats would comment on the deal in the original reports, and the briefed sources said they were still in the negotiation stage. Though the companies have yet to consummate the agreement, and it could still fall through, if things go as planned the official announcement could be made as early as next week.

The most likely destination of Safari defectors: Google's Chrome. According to California-based analytics vendor Net Applications, in March 2015, an estimated 69% of all Mac owners used Safari to go online. But by last month, that number had dropped to 56%, a drop of 13 percentage points -- representing a decline of nearly a fifth of the share of two years prior. It was possible to peg the percentage of Mac users who ran Safari only because that browser works solely on macOS, the Apple operating system formerly labeled OS X. The same single-OS characteristic of IE and Edge has made it possible in the past to determine the percentage of Windows users who run those browsers. [ Further reading: Microsoft continues to bleed browser share at record rates ] Net Applications measures user share by sniffing the browser user agent string of visitors to its customers' websites, then tallying the various browsers and OSes. Safari's share erosion was much less than that suffered by Microsoft's browsers, particularly IE, during the same period. From March 2015 to February 2017, the use of Microsoft's IE and Edge on Windows personal computers plummeted. Two years ago, the browsers were run by 62% of Windows PC owners; last month, the figure had fallen by more than half, to just 27%. Simultaneous with the decline of IE has been the rise of Chrome. The user share of Google's browser -- its share of all browsers on all operating systems -- more than doubled in the last two years, jumping from 25% in March 2015 to 59.5% last month. Along the way, Chrome supplanted IE to become the world's most-used browser. It's impossible to be certain, but Chrome was probably the beneficiary from Safari's user share decline as well. In the last 24 months, Mozilla's Firefox -- the other major browser alternative to Chrome for macOS users -- has barely budged, losing just two-tenths of a percentage point in user share. The downturn of both IE and Safari expose the fragility of what was once thought to be their biggest advantage: That they were bundled with their respective operating systems. Because they came with the operating system -- Windows in IE's case, OS X and now macOS in Safari's -- their position was believed unassailable; users, it was thought, would largely use what they were given, rather than seek out alternatives. Microsoft became the agent of IE's destruction when the company unexpectedly called for the retirement of most versions of the browser, and told customers they must upgrade to IE11. Faced with that, many instead simply deserted to Chrome. Apple did not make that same mistake, so reasons for Safari's decline are muddier. One possibility: Those who used both Windows and OS X/macOS -- perhaps one at work, the other at home -- may have shifted to the common denominator of Chrome for the convenience of bookmark and password synchronization. Under that theory, a small increase of Chrome on OS X/macOS was simply a side effect of the much larger rise of Chrome on Windows.

Warren, AP) 84 CONNECTTWEET 2 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Flying below the radar in the noisy world of music streaming, Amazon Music has quietly made a sizable impact on the country genre. The e-commerce giant has already been performing disproportionately well among country music listeners compared to top streaming competitors Spotify and Apple Music. Of its top-50 streamed songs in the final week of February, 16 were country songs. That’s compared to just one between Apple and Spotify combined. Of its top-50 albums, 18 were country albums compared to zero between Apple and Spotify. Though it did not disclose the raw numbers, Amazon confirmed that country music’s percentage of total plays on its streaming service is two-times the industry average. Spotify and Apple have been active in the Nashville music community for years and both services boast impressive overall streaming statistics and subscriber numbers. Ryan Redington, who heads Amazon’s music division, said the company’s success in country music is due at least in part to the in-roads made before its streaming service began to gain traction.

We’ve been selling CDs since 1998. So we’ve been in the music business for almost 20 years and built long relationships with those physical customers. “And a lot of those customers are country music customers. Then I think on the streaming side, what’s nice is as those customers choose to migrate from the physical to the streaming world, we have a very welcoming platform for the country music customer.” At a presentation at the annual Country Radio Seminar in Nashville in late February, Redington touted the company’s success with country fans. He said the company has demonstrated the importance of country with its recent investments. Amazon sponsored Garth Brook’s record-breaking tour and was the exclusive streaming partner when the country legend released finally released his catalog on the increasingly popular delivery platform. And Amazon’s success comes as the company staffs up its Nashville office. The company announced in late February that it has hired Music Row veteran Kelly Rich as senior label relations manager for Nashville. Emily Cohen also works out of the Nashville office as music curator, focusing on tracking trends within the country genre, identifying emerging artists and building out playlists. Rich joined Amazon after working at Big Machine Label Group, where she was the senior vice president of sales. Amazon’s success has not gone unnoticed on Music Row. Warner Music Nashville Chairman and CEO John Esposito said his company is fully aware of how well country music is doing on Amazon Music. "Amazon is disproportionately country," Esposito said. "Their top 50 has (16) songs, compared to four in the overall top 200 in any given week. So it's noteworthy. Country and classic rock seem to be over-indexing for them." Country is already the No. 1 station on Amazon Music. And Christian music, which is also largely headquartered in Nashville, is the No. 5 station, the company said. Redington said Amazon is betting on its voice-operated speaker system called Echo bringing in more streaming customers in the near future. Echo users can sign up for Amazon’s premium streaming service for just $4 per month. “I can walk home and say, ‘Alexa start playing country music,’ and she’ll just start playing country music on Echo just like that,” Redington said. “You can play country music by genre and by era, so I can say, ‘Play country music from the 70s or the 80s.’ We’ve created a very frictionless way to ask for music. “You can even ask Alexa to play a song by just singing certain lyrics to Alexa. We’re hoping and we’re confident that this frictionless, welcoming platform draws in more country fans.” Lynn Oliver-Cline, the founder and owner of independent music company River House Artists, which is the home to emerging star Luke Combs, said Amazon has already proven to be a great partner for up-and-coming artists. Much like John Marks with Spotify, Amazon is working to cultivate new artists and expose them to fans. “They are a great partner for us already and we still have some room to grow,” Oliver-Cline said. “They are continually coming up with new opportunities for country artists.” Reach Nate Rau at nrau@tennessean.com or 615-259-8094.

Brian Barrett Gear Date of Publication: 03.03.17. 03.03.17 Time of Publication: 9:30 am. 9:30 am The Silicon Shift That’s Transforming How Tech Giants Make Phones Xiaomi Apple does it. Samsung, too. You may not be as familiar with Huawei, but it’s been doing it for years too. And now the Chinese smartphone powerhouse Xiaomi has joined this growing club of big companies that don’t lean exclusively on Qualcomm and others for mobile chipsets. Instead, they just up and make their own. You can’t quite call it a trend, but seeing so many manufacturers invest in their own chipsets marks a significant shift in an industry long dependent on the same few silicon specialists. Like all big bets, it carries the promise of big rewards for the companies and their customers—and the threat of just as many risks. Breaking Free Let’s clarify up front that aside from Apple, these companies still do big business with Qualcomm, MediaTek, and other processor pros for “system on a chip” technology. And Apple still taps Qualcomm for the modem in the iPhone, despite pursuing a billion-dollar lawsuit over the company’s business practices. Chips Ahoy David Pierce China’s Plan to Rule the World: Make All the Gadgets Tim Moynihan New Qualcomm Tech Could Lead to the Ultimate Drone Brian Barrett Intel’s Chips Finally Find Their Way Into the iPhone Brian Barrett What the Snapdragon 835 Chip Means For Your Next Smartphone In one sense, this speaks to Qualcomm’s dominance and capabilities. Smartphone manufacturers rely on Qualcomm chips for the same reason spec home builders rely on Alabama white marble countertops: They’re top of the line. “If you’re looking for a high-performance part, and connectivity is key, there’s really only one game in town,” says Patrick Moorhead, founder of Moor Insights and Strategy. “And that’s Qualcomm.” The company’s deep resources and industry-wide relationships mean its chips just work, at a high level, with pretty much any hardware and software you can throw at it. That kind of ubiquity obviously benefits Qualcomm, but the fact that everyone uses the exact same chipset motivates companies like Xiaomi to develop their own alternatives. In the cutthroat world of premium smartphones, the desire to differentiate makes sense. Nearly every flagship device next year that isn’t an iPhone will use the Snapdragon 835 processor. It’s like having a Daytona 500 where car runs the exact same engine. Engineers might find other ways to tweak performance, but they’re all fundamentally the same. “When you make your own chips you can design them to be ideal for your specific devices, rather than being designed for all possible use cases,” says mobile analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research. You also dodge any rough patches a third-party supplier might experience. Rumors that Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 810 processor experienced overheating issues (later refuted) prompted Samsung to put the home-grown Exynos chips into the top-tier Galaxy S6 in 2015. Apple can do whatever it likes with its AX series of mobile processors, a freedom that reportedly has Cupertino considering a similar move in the Intel-dominated Mac space. All of which sounds great—if you can afford it. And Xiaomi can afford to take the risks. Where the Chips Fall Two years ago, Xiaomi decided to control its own destiny. “We need to be able to make a chipset to stand out as someone who was really innovative,” says company spokesman John Chan. “The key is having full control of the chipset and integration with the phone.” With that in mind, Xiaomi built the Surge S1, an eight-core, ARM-based processor that, while not exactly a powerhouse, can handle 4K video. More importantly, it’s fully integrated with the new Xiaomi 5C smartphone, which launched with the chip. Xiaomi’s 5C smartphone, with the company’s new chip inside. Xiaomi Xiaomi reportedly spent $145 million developing the Surge S1 and has already reaped benefits. First and foremost, it allowed Xiaomi to offer a phone right now— the Snapdragon 835 won’t appear until sometime in April with the launch of the Samsung Galaxy S8. Chan says the chip gives the company more control over when it pushes Android updates to customers.  And there are other areas to explore. Huawei, for instance, figured out how to squeeze a few days of battery out of its Keira 960 chip. What makes all of this so fascinating is it almost certainly couldn’t have happened even a few years ago. “What’s made it possible is intellectual property from ARM, and an improvement in the tools to design, develop, and take an SoC to a [fabrication plant] to go build it,” says Moorhead. Specifically, in recent years ARM introduced a program called Artisan, which provides something like an off-the-shelf intellectual property buffet. It’s easier than ever to build a processor operation from scratch—a major reason why it only took two years to go from urge to Surge. None of which necessarily makes any of this a good idea. Risky Business Apple’s success with the iPhone and its AX processors underscores how much can go right for companies that invest in developing their own silicon—but also belies how much can go wrong. “Unless you acquire an existing chip maker or designer you’re going to be worse at this than established chip makers,” says Dawson. That doesn’t just mean potential performance issues, though those are certainly possible. “Imagine if you messed up a chip and you’ve got to do a metal layer spin,” says Moorhead, referring to a step in semiconductor fabrication. “That could mean 90 days added to your schedule.” Then there’s compatibility, which creates the potential for pitfalls both specific and broad. A brand new chipset could create performance issues for individual apps. And big-picture features can remain beyond reach—Qualcomm, for example, builds the only chips with the muscle to handle Google’s ambitious Daydream mobile VR platform. That will likely be true of the next big breakthrough as well. “You run the risk of missing a major inflection point,” says Moorhead. That’s why the Surge S1 launches, at least, mostly as a hedge. Xiaomi says it remains committed to working with Qualcomm and its other parters, and vice versa. “We have a strong relationship with Xiaomi and will continue to collaborate to bring the latest technology features to mobile devices around the world,” says Qualcomm spokeswoman Tara Sims. How strong that relationship remains likely depends on the success Xiaomi finds with the Surge S1 and its successors. Chan says the company doesn’t expect a full return on investment until “much later on.” The company can’t achieve the same cost savings through scale that a company like Samsung can, because it doesn’t have the same breadth of products—the connected dishwashers and such—to plop chips in. But if Xiaomi’s gambit pays off, it raises the intriguing possibility that smartphones of the future won’t just be better. They’ll be different. They’ll offer options beyond screen size and and finish. After all, there’s no better feature than choice. Go Back to Top.

AbderholdenContact ReporterNews-Sun The latest arrest in connection with traveling scams in Lake County centers around two men who were going from Apple store to Apple store across the country returning old cellphones for new ones, but a traffic stop near the Deer Park store this week tripped them up, according to the Lake County Sheriff's Office. "These suspects were going across the country committing this fraud," said sheriff's office spokesman Sgt. Christopher Covelli. Three suspects charged with identity theft at Deer Park Apple store Just a day after sheriff detectives arrested two people at the Deer Park Apple Store for unauthorized purchases, a third out-of-state suspect was arrested Saturday night, according to Sgt.

Just a day after sheriff detectives arrested two people at the Deer Park Apple Store for unauthorized purchases, a third out-of-state suspect was arrested Saturday night, according to Sgt. Christopher Covelli of the Lake County Sheriff's Office. John Michael Johnson, 18, of Ferndale, Mich., was...Read the story "They were using fake names to exchange the phones. The phones they would exchange would be so severely damaged, and in some cases SuperGlued to prevent staff from seeing the serial number to determine if the phone were stolen," he added. "They would then get a new refurbished phone, which they would sell for significant profit." According to Covelli, a sheriff's deputy conducted a traffic stop Tuesday on a vehicle in the area of the Deer Park Town Center on Route 12 north of Lake Cook Road, where the sheriff's office has conducted increased patrols due to the Apple Store thefts. The driver of the car, Mohammed Hosein, 23, of Detroit, said he and his passenger, Wen Jie Qin, 21, of San Francisco, just left the Apple Store after exchanging broken iPhones. Covelli said they were pulled over for a traffic infraction and the driver had a suspended driver's license. "The alert sheriff's deputy, knowing there have been a number of fraudulent purchases at the Deer Park Apple Store, conducted additional investigation," Covelli said in a statement issued early Friday. "After further investigation by sheriff's deputies and detectives, it was determined Hosein and Qin traveled to numerous Apple Stores across the United States and fraudulently obtained possession of numerous Apple iPhones," the statement added. "Over 100 Apple iPhones were recovered from Qin and Hosein, which they obtained fraudulently," 2 arrested for trying to make fraudulent Apple store purchases, police say Jim Newton Two people who attempted to gain access to user accounts and make unauthorized purchases at the Apple store in Deer Park were arrested Friday night by the Lake County Sheriff's Office, Sgt.

Christopher Covelli said. Alexander J. Soto, 25, of Yonkers, N.Y., and Diamand D. Reid, 22, of Roseville,... (Jim Newton) Hosein was charged with felony charges of burglary and retail theft along with traffic-related offenses, Covelli said, adding that Hosein was held Friday morning in Lake County Jail on $50,000 bail pending a March 27 appearance in court. Qin was also charged with felony charges of burglary and retail theft, and he was also held Friday in Lake County Jail on $50,000 bail with the same scheduled court date, according to Covelli. Since last summer, there have been 12 arrests related to the Deer Park store, with seven New York state suspects arrested over a three-day period in late July for allegedly using stolen identities and stolen credit card numbers of victims throughout the country to make the purchases across the Chicago area, according to police. At the time, Covelli said the suspects would fly into O'Hare International Airport, rent a car and go to Apple stores to attempt to make purchases. Beside those seven initial suspects, three other people, two from Michigan and one from New York state, were arrested at the end of January for making unauthorized purchases, and they were charged with burglary and identity theft, according to police. In August 2016, a Las Vegas couple was arrested after a clerk at the Deer Park Apple store recognized the couple from a corporate alert that they were wanted for theft from Chicago area stores in Schaumburg and Oak Brook, and in the states of California and Nevada. Two stolen Apple drones were found inside the vehicle, according to police. In Gurnee at the end of January, police arrested three people from Orlando, Fla., who had flown into Chicago and rented a car for a $20,000 shopping spree in the village using fraudulent credit cards. Gurnee police said that on Jan.11, they received several calls from businesses that had been victims of credit card fraud totaling approximately $20,000, according to police. The suspects' descriptions were similar, and one of the victims got a description of their vehicle, which was registered to a rental car company. According to police, they searched hotels in the area and found the rental car, learned what hotel room the suspects were in and made the arrests without incident. "These rings travel all over the U.S., but the sheriff's office and Deer Park Apple Store have been working very diligently together to identify and arrest thieves," Covelli said Friday. fabderholden@tribpub.com Twitter @abderholden Privacy Policy Copyright © 2017, Lake County News-Sun Crime Theft Reaction to the new travel ban Chance the Rapper donates $1 million to CPS 2017 Chicago Polar Plunge Sports Breaking Trending RedEye Opinion Suburbs Entertainment Advertising 57°

MobilityDevices Back to Home Apple takes patent battle against Qualcomm to UK Increase / Decrease text size Byomakesh Biswal 3rd March 2017 Add to favorites It is Apple’s fourth lawsuit overall. Apple has further expanded its ongoing legal battle against Qualcomm with a new patent lawsuit in the UK. Details about the lawsuit are unclear at the moment, but Bloomberg reported that the suit revolves around patents and registered designs. Apple already filed a case against Qualcomm in the US and two in China. Both the lawsuits were filed in January. According to the Verge, Apple said the lawsuit in the UK was also filed back in January alongside the other lawsuits, but is only being noticed now due to a refiling. Apple alleged that Qualcomm unfairly charges royalties for technology they have nothing to do with. In the US case, Apple accused Qualcomm of charging it “at least five times more in payments than all the other cellular patent licensors we have agreements with combined.” The two lawsuits in China accuse Qualcomm of misusing its power in the processor industry and failing to fulfill promises to broadly licence standard essential patents at a reasonable price. One of the China lawsuits seeks JPY1bn (about $146m) in damages. As part of the claim, Apple accused Qualcomm of violating China’s Anti-Monopoly Law. Qualcomm is also facing anti-trust action by the US Federal Trade Commission and investigations by the European Union and Taiwan. Last December, Qualcomm was fined $853m by South Korea over unfair patent licensing practices. The company has however appealed the penalty.

Apple CEO Tim Cook referred to the company’s legal battle with Qualcomm during the recent earnings call, explaining that he sees litigation as a last resort and is open to settling the lawsuit. Cook said: “I don’t like litigation, and so if there’s another way, then that would be great, but at this point I don’t see it. I fully expect at this point in time that it will take some time, but in the end, I think common sense will prevail, and the courts will see it for what it is. So that’s the way I see it.” Tags Apple Qualcomm Previous ArticleIs Facebook turning its back on AI chatbots?

This implies that the company will have the sensor built into the display as the iPhone 8 is rumored to have no bezels whatsoever. Rather than relying on Synaptic or Qualcomm for the technology, Apple will be building the sensor in-house with Authentec algorithms and Privaris glass tech. Interestingly, the report also says that the iPhone 8 will not be going into production until September.. Apple typically needs months of leeway before launching a new iPhone. The company usually sells 15 million units within the opening weekend alone. A September production date means that Apple could potentially be launching this phone in October or later. Digitimes says that an Apple-custom fingerprint sensor is much more difficult to manufacture. The new component will use technologies such as ultrasound rather than relying on a capacitive sensor that’s currently being used with Touch ID. The September production date should be taken with a grain of salt, however, as the last iPhone launched in October was the iPhone 4s. If the phone truly doesn’t begin production in September, we should expect a launch date of late October, at the earliest.

Lake County sheriff’s deputies stopped a vehicle near the Deer Park Town Center on Wednesday, according to a statement from the sheriff’s office. The driver, 23-year-old Mohammed Hosein; and the passenger, 21-year-old Wen Jie Qin, had just left the Deer Park Apple store after exchanging broken iPhones. After a series of recent fraudulent purchases at that store, the deputies decided to investigate further, the sheriff’s office said. They found the two men to be in possession of more than 100 iPhones. Investigators determined that Hosein, of Detroit; and Qin, who lives in San Francisco, traveled to Apple stores across the county and “fraudulently obtained possession of numerous Apple iPhones,” according to the sheriff’s office. Qin and Hosein were charged with one count each of burglary and retail theft, both felonies, and were each ordered held on $50,000 bonds. Ten people from New York and Michigan were arrested in 2016 and earlier this year in connection with fraudulent purchases at Apple stores, several at the Deer Park location, according to the sheriff’s office. Deputies are providing increased patrols at the store as the investigation continues.

Login Search Buying Snap Today Could Be Like Buying Apple 35 Years Ago March 03, 2017, 08:36:01 AM EDT By Chris Ciaccia Snapchat (Shutterstock photo) Many on Wall Street are comparing Snap Inc. (SNAP) to Facebook (FB) or Twitter (TWTR) and for now, that's okay. All three can be considered social networks, rely on daily active users and generate the majority of their revenue from advertising. In the future, however, Snap may wind up being more like another Silicon Valley giant than the aforementioned ones -- Apple (AAPL). Buying stock in Snap today is a bet on CEO Evan Spiegel more than it is on the company's prowess as an advertising behemoth. Spiegel, 26, is a product visionary the world has not seen seen Apple's Steve Jobs and to some extent, Tesla Inc. (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk.  There are similarities between Jobs and Spiegel, both starting their companies after dropping out of college, are wonderful salesmen and marketers, but the similarities go further than that. Jobs is Spiegel's idol; he has a portrait of the legendary Apple co-founder hanging in his office. When unveiling Spectacles to The Wall Street Journal this past fall, he even used Jobs-ian language, saying "You wanna see it?" as he took off the towel covering the product. This mentality plays to the culture of secrecy at both companies, not releasing products until they are ready to be talked about.  And unlike other technology companies, neither Snap or Apple have "beta" products. There is no group of early adopters buying and using a product so the companies can get an idea of how users are interacting with it and then continue to refine. Every meticulous detail is thought out and obsessed over and is not released until it's perfect. Aegis Capital analyst Victor Anthony said the company's most valuable asset is its demographic, with 13-24 year olds comprising nearly 60% of its user base. While these are highly coveted by advertisers such as Procter & Gamble, Clorox and others, Spiegel is the company's most valuable asset. The ability to know what people want before they want or see it is an invaluable trait that very few executives have. It can not be measured or valued, but it's something that investors need to keenly aware of when looking at where to put their investing dollars. Snap has positioned and sold itself as a camera company, having mentioned that multiple times in its S-1. This can allow them to expand into everything and anything that has a camera.  Despite the optimism surrounding Spiegel, the stickiness of Snapchat (engagement levels are shockingly high) and the coveted user base, it's not all roses for Snap at this stage. There are concerns about the company's financial picture, as it still generates the majority of its revenue from advertising. Going up against Facebook and Google, which have mountains of user data that advertisers love, can be a daunting task (just ask Twitter). Issues surrounding slowing user growth, the ability for competitors to copy product features, lack of data analytics, no voting control with Class A shares are all valid reasons to be wary of Snap, especially at a $35 billion valuation.  But again, it comes down to be at the forefront of an area that's only going to expand with a product visionary for a CEO. Images, whether it's augmented reality, virtual reality, moving or static, are humanity's future. All you have to do is just look at the popularity of Instagram to see why. Snap, with Snapchat, its burgeoning hardware portfolio and most importantly Spiegel, is poised to be at the forefront of this trend for many years to come.

Millions. And millions more. Here's what investors should know about Buffett's bet on Apple stock. Daniel Sparks (TMFDanielSparks) Mar 3, 2017 at 9:16AM You've probably seen the headlines. Famed billionaire investor Warren Buffett has been loading up on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock. But just how many shares has he bought through Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) (NYSE:BRK-A)? Millions of shares and billions of dollars A glance at Berkshire's most recent SEC filing with updates on the company's common stock investments reveals Apple has become one of Berkshire's largest positions, valued at over $7 billion. But Buffett didn't stop at the 61.2 million Apple shares reported in the annual 10-K filing. The Berkshire chairman and CEO has since more than doubled his position in Apple, growing Berkshire's slice of the tech giant to a whopping 133 million shares, Buffett said in a CNBC interview this week. This puts Berkshire's stake in the $729 billion company at about 2.5%. Image source: Apple. There's no doubt this investment in Apple is an important wager for Berkshire. With Apple stock trading at about $139 at the time of this writing, that's an $18.5 billion position, second only to Berkshire's $29 billion position in Wells Fargo and edging out Berkshire's $17 billion position in Coca-Cola. Berkshire's fourth, fifth, and sixth biggest holdings are IBM, American Express, and Phillips 66, valued at about $13 billion, $11 billion, and $6 billion, respectively. Still a fraction of Berkshire's whole business Despite being Berkshire's second-largest holding now, investors shouldn't expect Berkshire's performance to be heavily influenced by Apple stock. Berkshire is a large company in its own right, with a market capitalization of $432 billion. Further, Berkshire's results remain more closely tied to its wholly owned subsidiaries than its equities portfolio. First in importance at Berkshire is its wholly owned insurance businesses, which include giants Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, General Re, GEICO, and more. Together, Berkshire's insurance businesses ended 2016 with $91.5 billion of float, or premiums collected upfront that can be invested, and generated a combined underwriting profit of $2.1 billion. Then there's Berkshire's regulated, capital-intensive business, which includes BNSF railroad and Berkshire Hathaway Energy (Berkshire's 90%-owned utility business). These two companies alone accounted for 33% of Berkshire's after-tax operating profits in 2016. Berkshire agreed to acquire BNSF in 2009 in a deal that valued the railway company at $34 billion. Image source: BNSF. And Berkshire's subsidiaries don't stop here. Berkshire's manufacturing, service, and retailing operations "sell products ranging from lollipops to jet airplanes," Buffett said in his 2016 annual letter to shareholders. This "motley crew," as Buffett calls it, generated $5.6 billion in operating profits for Berkshire. Or, as explained in Berkshire's 10-K filing, their combined results can be summed up like this: Viewed as a single entity, the companies in the manufacturing, service and retailing group are an excellent business. They employed an average of $24 billion of net tangible assets during 2016 and, despite their holding large quantities of excess cash and carrying very little debt, earned 24% after-tax on that capital. Finally, Berkshire's finance and financial products businesses generated a nice $2.1 billion of net income for Berkshire in 2016. So, yes, Buffett's bet on Apple is massive next to Berkshire's other common stock investments. And the massive position is certainly a signal of Buffett's great confidence in the tech giant's long-term potential. But both Apple and Berkshire investors should keep in mind that Berkshire is still far more than an $18.5 billion bet on Apple. Daniel Sparks owns shares of Apple.

Harsh Chauhan (TechJunk13) Mar 3, 2017 at 8:11AM In the third quarter, just over a third of Qorvo's (NASDAQ:QRVO) revenue came from its largest customer. Though Qorvo didn't name this customer explicitly, it is widely believed the company's biggest account is Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), to which it supplies radio frequency chips to enhance signals. This would make Qorvo one of the more diversified Apple suppliers, especially compared to Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) and Cirrus Logic (NASDAQ: CRUS), which are reportedly dependent on Apple for 40% and 85% of their revenues, respectively. In that light, Qorvo seems like a diversified bet. What's more, Qorvo's second-largest customer, with 11% of revenue, is the fast-growing Chinese smartphone player Huawei. Additionally, it counts Samsung (NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) among its client list. All this diversification, however, couldn't save Qorvo from setting weak guidance for the fourth quarter. Qorvo expects its fourth-quarter revenue to be $630 million at the midpoint of its guidance range. This is much lower than the consensus revenue estimate of $719 million, and if Qorvo manages to hit the midpoint of its guidance, its revenue will increase just 3.6% from the prior-year period. Let's take a look at what's going on with the company and why investors should take note. Image source: Qorvo. The problems at Qorvo Qorvo's key smartphone clients are under pressure, and this is reflected in the company's guidance. CFO Mark Murphy had the following to say about the company's weak outlook during the Feb. 1 conference call (transcript via Seeking Alpha), "This guidance primarily reflects a greater than historical sequential decline in the March quarter, as two of our leading customers in China and a tier 1 customer in Korea delayed flagship smartphone launches." The delayed smartphone launch by Qorvo's Korean customer seems to be a reference to Samsung, since the Galaxy S8 won't be launched at the Mobile World Congress happening this week, as the S7 was last year. Samsung is reportedly going to launch its flagship in April instead, as it carries out intensive testing of the device to avoid a Note7-like fiasco. There's no doubt that this delay has pushed back Qorvo's potential revenue from Samsung by at least a quarter and led to a weak outlook. Meanwhile, Apple is believed to be slashing its iPhone production by roughly 10% in the current quarter, after producing more units than it sold during the holiday period. Supply chain data suggests that Apple placed orders to manufacture 89 million iPhone units in the December-ended quarter, while it sold only 78.3 million. This leaves Apple with a surplus of around 10 million iPhones for the current quarter, so it has reportedly decided to scale back production. In fact, Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities is of the opinion that iPhone production will decline throughout the first half of 2017, until the production cycle of the next model kicks in. So, it looks like Qorvo will not get any bump in its revenue from its largest customer in the first half of 2017. But is there more afoot here than just declining smartphone orders? Is Skyworks eating Qorvo's lunch? Qorvo is a direct competitor of Skyworks Solutions, as both companies make radio-frequency components for the same customers. However, Skyworks provided a strong outlook for the current quarter when it released results in January. Its revenue expectation of $840 million means that its top line could grow 8% from the prior-year period and exceed consensus analyst estimates of $818 million, while Qorvo's revenue is expected to increase just 3.6%. As Skyworks' outlook is rosier than Qorvo's, the former could be winning market share. Mike Walkley of Canaccord Genuity (via Barron's) has a similar opinion, writing: We also believe Skyworks is increasing content with Samsung and is well positioned for content growth with new Samsung products ramping in the upcoming quarters. We believe other Chinese OEMs will follow Huawei's leadership with increased RF content. Additionally, Skyworks CEO Liam Griffin said that his company has seen content wins in "multiple devices across Samsung's entire portfolio, and gained momentum in China, with key wins at market leaders Oppo, Vivo, Meizu, and Xiaomi." The comments made by Skyworks after its latest results indicate that it is winning a lot of content in the same areas where Qorvo is not feeling confident. In fact, Huawei has now become Skyworks' second-largest customer after Skyworks won almost all of the RF chip spots in Huawei's P9 flagship smartphones last year. On the other hand, Skyworks had reportedly won three spots in the iPhone 7, while Qorvo supplied two chips. In comparison, both companies had two chips each inside the iPhone 6s, according to a teardown of the device by Chipworks. The competition from Skyworks is a red flag that Qorvo investors should not ignore. Harsh Chauhan has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Credit: Apple More like this Apple’s Siri has a huge language advantage Apple is teaching Siri to learn new tricks Everything is a virtual assistant now Video Mingis on Tech: Self-driving cars, wireless charging -- and Wi-Fi lightbulbs? Google isn’t saying it will and Apple’s iOS developer guidelines say it can’t, but a senior Googler set the cat among the pigeons when he suggested the company would like to put its Assistant tech on iPhones. Fanning the flames It’s a rumor. Google product management director Gummi Hafsteinsson told Geekster, “I do not think we have anything to announce at this point, but I think the general philosophy is that we would like to have the Assistant available to as many people as possible." He was speaking at Mobile World Congress. It would not be possible for Google to make its Assistant tech available through an iOS app under Apple’s existing App Store rules. In part this is because Apple already offers its own system-level voice assistant, Siri; it is also because Google would need to secure permission to transmit your personal data as it sends your spoken question to its servers to get you a response. Google could introduce Google Assistant as a Web service, in which case iOS users could access it using a browser. Web search is heading in this direction: Korean search engine, Naver, recently made a strategic investment in SoundHound, for example. Contextual search Google Assistant supports sophisticated, context-based search. This means you can ask it a question such as “what movies are on at the local cinemas”, it will provide an answer, and you can then contextualise the search, for example by asking to limit the list to films on show in the area that feature a specific actor or director. The capacity for more intelligent spoken search is at present an advantage to Assistant. Google Assistant is now being extended to more Android devices, but is far from universal. Apple’s Siri isn’t as good at this – you must ask it a completely different search question and you cannot contexualize within the results. I do think Apple is working on this, as you can contextualize some searches when you use an Apple TV (“show me movies”, “just the good ones”). Siri also enjoys the huge advantage of being available across 90 percent of all iOS devices and useful to five times as many people as Assistant. (It’s also less sexist). A.I. smackdown Voice assistants started as a nice to have but are becoming a must have. Huawei, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Google, Samsung and others all have one. Competition in the space is intense, and Google now knows it needs to fight to maintain a good share in the industry, particularly as key Android vendors (such as Samsung) deploy their own voice A.I., rather than Google’s. Another big player in voice, Amazon, is also staking space in mobile: Alexa will be on the Android-powered Huawei Mate 9 smartphone. Google sees smart assistants as “part of an ongoing conversation with users,” Google CEO, Sundar Pichai said this week. Within this it cannot ignore that the fragmented Android ecosystem and intense competition in this space is an existential threat for the search engine giant as consumers diversify the services they use for search. Apple’s turn We know Apple has been investing deeply in A.I. R&D at offices across the planet. We also expect significant improvements to Siri this June at WWDC. This means that in order to keep pace, Google must ensure its solution is not only better than the current iteration of Siri, Cortana, Alexa, et al., but that it is better than the versions that are to come. That’s going to be pretty hard to achieve when most of the global population speaks a different language, and Apple keeps its cards so close to its chest.

 Apple has 3 execs looking to make big TV deals — and it sounds like a total mess Kif Leswing Mar. 3, 2017, 9:36 AM 2,531 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple CEO Tim Cook and SVP Eddy CueKevork Djansezian/Getty Images Apple has several executives leading negotiations with Hollywood companies for the rights to TV shows and movies, and potentially a big purchase of a content company, the New York Post reports. Apple execs have met with Paramount, and Sony's TV and film departments, according to the report. Previously, the Financial Times reported that Apple had entered into talks with Ron Howard's Imagine Entertainment.  These talks could've taken place last month, when Apple CEO Tim Cook and SVP Eddy Cue were in LA to attend both the Oscars and the Grammys.  But most interestingly, the Post's sources say Apple hasn't figured out who's leading the negotiations: sometimes it's Cue, sometimes it's his longtime lieutenant Robert Kondrk, and sometimes it's Jimmy Iovine, founder of Beats and music industry heavyweight. He doesn't have a title at Apple — it's just "Jimmy." The Post's Claire Atkinson writes: As Apple executives are busying looking to do business in Hollywood, entertainment industry insiders are scratching their heads over who, exactly, is driving the effort. “Robert Kondrk, Eddy Cue, Jimmy Iovine, everyone is trying to be the person,” one insider told The Post. “They each want to be the guy, and they’re telling people, don’t deal with the other one.” That sounds messy, and it's not the first time we've heard about this type of confusion in Apple. Last year, in an article about Apple Music's redesign and music content negotiations, Bloomberg reported:  While Iovine’s connections make him valuable, they’re also a source of friction inside Apple. There were times when they were in the middle of negotiations with an artist's managers and labels while, unbeknownst to them, Iovine was carrying out his own separate discussions, according to people familiar with the matter. Apple has long wanted to release a standout TV product, most likely along with a TV subscription service, but it has been stymied in negotiations with content producers before.  But Apple has made smaller bets on TV shows, including "Planet of the Apps" and "Carpool Karaoke," which will launch on Apple Music, Apple's music subscription service.  Currently, Apple TV, an internet-connected streaming box that plugs into TVs through an HDMI port, is seeing year-over-year declines in sales.  During Apple's most recent earnings call, Cook gave some color on the company's original content ambitions:  "In terms of original content, we have put our toe in the water doing some original content for Apple Music, and that will be rolling out through the year. We are learning from that, and we'll go from there. The way that we participate in the changes that are going on in the media industry — that I fully expect to accelerate from the cable bundle beginning to break down — is: 1. We started the new Apple TV a year ago, we're pleased on how that platform has come along. We have more things planned for it, but it's come a long way in a year, and it gives us a clear platform to build off of. 2. Embedded in the 150 million paid subscriptions that I mentioned in my opening comments, there's a number of third-party services that are a part of that, where we participate economically in some of that by offering our platform selling and distributing. 3. With our toe in the water we are learning a lot about the original content business, and thinking about ways that we could play in that."

I’ve also had the fun of contributing my $.02 on the topic at Computerworld, Engadget, Macworld, SlashGear and now iMore. Most recently I spent a few years at Apple as Sr. Director of Worldwide Product Marketing. On Twitter I’m an unverified @gartenberg. I still own some Apple stock. I loved the wearable category. And I still do... Sort of. Let's define a "smartwatch": For argument's sake, I'm defining the term as anything that functions like a watch, but needs to be recharged. It's a broad definition, I grant you, but it works for the most part. Apple Watch is a smartwatch; a Timex or a Rolex is not. Now let's define what Smartwatches aren't: watches. They're more like little computers, running an OS and using Apps but living on my arm instead of my pocket. They're also not timeless. My Omega Seamaster was passed on to my son, just like my father passed it on to me. My Breitlings have passed to my sons as well. My Apple Watch, however, will be recycled once the battery can no longer hold a charge. Despite this, I'm still a fan of smartwatches — but I also understand why they haven't cracked the true mainstream. I always felt the wrist was the perfect choice for a screen. After all, a watch delivers one or two bits of information, usually time and date. What a waste of space. It's like undeveloped beach front property. And as we well know, screens are important. Every screen a consumer interacts with can define a category: TVs, phones, PCs. But here's where I missed the ball: Those watches have to look great for users to even consider strapping it to their wrist. Some smartwatches are fashionable, such as Apple Watch or the Samsung Gear 2 (not 3). But most of them are big, clunky, skeuomorphic things that could make even a geek cry. Apple made Watch cool and hip and fashionable, which helps as an initial driver. It also wisely focused on health and fitness, as have other platforms. But it turns out that's not a driver for many consumers — those same consumers, after all, bought Fitbits and ended up tossing them in the drawer. Notifications are another great driver, and where I find that the Apple Watch really shines. But that's it: I can pitch someone on an Apple Watch, but I can only offer two major use cases, maybe three. I'll toss in checking the weather... but not "breaking news" from CNN. They're all good usage models, but none of them screams must-have the way the iPhone did before them; as such, I don't think any of them will push the category beyond a limited point. That doesn't mean that smartwatches are a failure: Devices like Apple Watch have their place on the wrist, and they've sold in quite impressive quantities over the last few years. But until Apple — or other companies — figure out the true mainstream use for the smartwatch, it shall remain a product for a specific niche. It may make that niche very happy, but to the general user, that happiness may be trickier to replicate. Like us! Share on Facebook Reader comments The pros and cons of smartwatches 12 Comments View All Comments Log In to Comment Register Sort by Date Sort by Rating KendallFawcett I was criticized quite a bit when I suggested, just after the Apple Watch was released, that it really isn't a watch. I think it's a little mini computer that ALSO displays the time. My observations were in response to the "I won't buy one unless it's round like a REAL watch," comments or, "It's ugly compared to my (fill in the blank with some expensive watch I've never heard of)." I don't really care that my $600 watch won't be passed down to someone else, just as I'm not concerned that my new washer and dryer won't be passed down to anyone. Let's face it, I'm sure LOTS of people have proudly presented their $5000 or $10000 watch to a child who looked at it, pretended to smile and then threw it in a drawer. I bought the Apple Watch for what it does, and it does it just fine for me. Oddly, what I like best about the Apple Watch is how easy it is to control the music, wirelessly at my Zumba classes. I say "oddly" because I don't pay any attention to the fitness tracking aspects. And, before you jump on me, which I'm sure will happen, I had a Pebble before and controlling the tracks AND volume was quite difficult. So, go ahead, hate me... 1 4 days ago Reply DannyJJK That's the exact reason it's not round; it's a mini computer. Normal watches are round because when the hands spin round, they form a circular rotation, and since a normal watch doesn't display anything else it makes sense to make it round. The Apple Watch on the other hand (no pun intended) displays information that a computer displays; text, UIs, photos etc. Computer screens aren't round because it wouldn't work, and in the same manner it doesn't really work for a smartwatch. I personally think the Apple Watch is a great looking device, if normal watches weren't round to begin with everyone would be loving how the Apple Watch looks. I bought the Apple Watch from day 1 when it first came out, and I haven't regretted it since. Still works like a dream and is incredibly helpful to me 🙂⌚️ 1 4 days ago Reply KendallFawcett Yup, and it's the reason that iPhones and computer monitors and laptops aren't round. Oh, and I don't care if my laptop gets passed on to someone else, either. 1 4 days ago Reply Ziich47 Smart watches are definitely not a failure but they are far from the finished product. It reminds me of the early days of android phones clunky and cumbersome. So far from what I have seen smart watches do not appeal to me as of yet. However, maybe in a couple years they will reach maturity and will be able to be both capable, durable and beautiful 0 4 days ago Reply DannyJJK The Apple Watch was a bit clunky when it first came out, suffering from being too slow, but on the latest watchOS version, it works pretty well. You should try one out in the Apple Store 0 4 days ago Reply KendallFawcett I would truly love a new one. My current AW (the first one out) was given as a birthday gift by my partner so it's kind of hard to go for a new one now... :-( #firstWorldProblem 1 4 days ago Reply paulxxwall Fossil has nice smartwatches and they look nice but wonder how compatible they are with iPhones . Always like fossils movados diesel watches those are nice the Apple watches..... meh. Sent from the iMore App 0 4 days ago Reply Chollatech I've been using various wearables with clients living with cognitive disabilities with some measurable success. We keep a narrow focus on personal time management and organization. A computer strapped to a wrist is superior to a smart phone because it cant be ignored or missed when properly set up. We work on simple scripts, "make me a reminder...", "make an appointment..." and keep it at that and that simple. As assistive technology wearable technology is a hit. Sent from the iMore App 0 4 days ago Reply danmart I think there are two evolutionary steps that are needed for the smart watch to really take off. The first is that they need a thinner option. Some people like 'big' watches (I don't personally think the Apple Watch is big, but it certainly isn't small) but many people really like slim watches. This is especially true (in my experience) of people with small wrists. Give people a slim option or an 'endurance' option with more battery and let them choose the look / capability mix that fits them best. The second is that the watches need to be able to do more without a tethered phone. My Series 0 Watch really struggles to function when outside of the same room as my iPhone, even though my house isn't huge and I have pervasive wifi. Part of the problem is that I have AC wifi but when the phone is on one band and the watch on another the wifi link doesn't seem to work well. If a new watch had superior connectivity through either wifi or mobile / cellular connectivity it would gain a more clear use-case. Currently when I am using my Watch I could probably take my phone out of a pocket instead, and given that the Watch is still a bit slow to carry out tasks getting the phone out would actually be quicker. This needs to change before the smart watch in general becomes more compelling. The best use case for my Watch is actually in the car. Whilst I have Bluetooth connectivity in my car, it doesn't give the best control options and choosing a track from my library of over 1000 albums is very difficult. The Watch gives me a very effective way of choosing music whilst driving (regular 'Hey Siri' doesn't work well in the car). When CarPlay become more ubiquitous this will be less relevant, but until then it's a very useful capability. 0 3 days ago Reply PoisonMaps Whether or not a smartwatch is useful to you is subjective. My partner (who is not a gadget fan) accidentally left her watch at home today and has texted to say that she feels lost without it. She sends texts and uses reminders all the time and frequently doesn’t have her phone on her (no pockets), but has it nearby, so it is great to still get notifications on the watch. She is also addicted to filling her activity rings, which is a good thing. I always have my phone in my pocket, so I don’t absolutely need the notifications, but do like the fact that I don’t have to dig my phone out (especially as it’s a 6S Plus). I don’t really care about the activity rings but use the watch obsessively when exercising (so much so that I am writing a workout app with an offline moving map for when I am hiking or mountain biking!).

The post has since been taken down, but initially included the caption: “How did I end up in the studio with Dr Dre ON THE night his deal went public that he did with Apple 3.2 BILLION!!!!! The BEATS HEADPHONES JUST CHANGED HIP HOP!!!!!!” WATCH: The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Financial Times reported the story Thursday citing sources briefed on the talks. Beats by Dre headphones‘ annual sales revenues have reportedly gone up to $1.5 billion since the company was founded with music executive Jimmy Iovine began selling headphones in 2008. The deal would include the new Beats Music streaming service, which Apple is likely acquiring to compete with streaming services like Pandora and Spotify after the company’s iTunes Radio failed to impress the industry. Apple’s revenue growth has declined sharply in recent years, and the company only entered the broadly popular streaming market last year — late because of former CEO Steve Jobs’ reported unfavorable opinion of music subscription services. The company continues to be the largest seller of music downloads, but is losing market share to companies like Amazon. Purchasing Beats would mark Apple’s largest acquisition ever. The headphones retail between about $169.95 to $449.95, depending on model and features, and despite many music and sound industry experts describing their quality as “extraordinarily bad,” the brand has become enormously popular as a fashion item among a younger consumer base, and the popular alternative to standard earbuds models. Beats’ success is due in large part to its wide profit margins – despite the steep prices of the popular bass-heavy headphone models, each individual unit reportedly only costs around $14 to produce. Private equity firm Carlyle Group invested $500 million in Beats last year, and valued the company at more than $1 billion. Neither Apple nor Beats would comment on the deal in the original reports, and the briefed sources said they were still in the negotiation stage. Though the companies have yet to consummate the agreement, and it could still fall through, if things go as planned the official announcement could be made as early as next week.

The firm has around twice as many free subscribers, 100 million, and a handful of disgruntled artists including one called Taylor Swift. Spotify announced the 500 million number on Twitter, which is handy. Thank you to our 50 million subscribers. #Spotify50 pic.twitter.com/eXkOV71bwu — Spotify (@Spotify) March 2, 2017 Amusingly, the Tweet kicked off a series of complaints from users about missing content. One angered and impassioned Hilary Duff fan insisted on full discography satisfaction, and Spotify conceded that it has gaps in its inventory. We include it here in all its glory. @imMoisesO We understand. We'd love to have all of her stuff available, but we have some info about content at https://t.co/YlV1IAXwsi /AC — SpotifyCares (@SpotifyCares) March 3, 2017 It has taken some short time for Spotify to hit the 50 million number, and it seems apposite to mention how many users Apple Music has, for example. Well, late last year it was reported that the service had reached 20 million paying subscribers, but that was last year and Apple launched well behind Spotify. Both services have challenges to face in so much as they charge people and that does not always go down well on the internet. In October the results of a YouGov and Zuora survey showed that just 10 per cent of UK residents, or 5.2 million people, are signed up to a paid music streaming service. Apple and Spotify have not got on in the traditional sense and there has been some App Store controversy between the pair over pricing and competition. Spotify had baulked at the fact that in app payments get a 30 per cent App store deduction, and Apple told it to pay up or shut up. "We understand that you want special treatment and protections from competition, but we simply will not do that because we firmly adhere to the principle of treating all developers fairly and equitably," said Apple general counsel Bruce Sewell in a letter to the firm. Spotify shot back. "This latest episode raises serious concerns under US and EU competition law," wrote general counsel Horacio Gutierrez. "It continues a troubling pattern of behaviour by Apple to exclude and diminish the competitiveness of Spotify on iOS and as a rival to Apple Music, particularly when seen against the backdrop of Apple's previous anti-competitive conduct aimed at Spotify. We cannot stand by as Apple uses the App Store approval process as a weapon to harm competitors." Don't get us started on Taylor Swift. µ Tweet   Facebook   Google plus       Send to   Topics Communications Money internet SPOTIFY cloud computing INQ Latest Twitch warns users of potential unauthorised account access Amazon-owned gaming service resets some user passwords Security 07 March 2017 Galaxy S8 and S8+ specs, release date and price Release date reportedly pushed back to 28 April Phones 06 March 2017 Microsoft's UUP shrinks Windows 10 updates by 65 per cent for Insiders Firm promises a 35 per cent reduction for retail users Cloud 06 March 2017 Hackers find 85 vulnerabilities in WD My Cloud range So you think your files aren't safe online, huh?

While you and I may choose Apple products because we like the UI, the ecosystem and the designs, a large chunk of the company’s customer base automatically buys Apple simply because it is seen as the most premium brand. They may not know the specific benefits of Apple products, but they are – to quote an old ad slogan for a lager – reassuringly expensive. If they cost more, they must be better. Indeed, in many markets, being seen with an iPhone, iPad or Mac bestows social status for that very reason, making them aspirational products. Apple cannot afford to dent that premium image by offering low-end products, but at the same time it needs to bring in new customers to maintain growth. So far, its approach to doing this has seemed to me to be smart. But offering a 32GB iPhone 6 as an entry level iPhone in 2017? That I’m not so sure about … Amazon Prime, free delivery, free videos Apple’s approach to entry-level purchases has historically been twin-pronged. In Macs, it used to offer an 11-inch MacBook Air as a relatively affordable entry to the Mac world. The 11-inch Air is no more, but the 13-inch model at $999 still hits a price-point many will pay. In iPhones and iPads, the company has traditionally kept an older model in the line-up as the base product. Given that Apple typically continues to offer support for the latest version of iOS for years after release, that’s been a reasonable approach – though older iPhones do sometimes struggle when running the latest updates, a point I’ll return to shortly. Last year, however, Apple took a somewhat different approach, by launching a brand new affordable model: the iPhone SE. That struck me as a much smarter bet than continuing to sell old models. For the first time, those on a more constrained budget could buy a brand new iPhone, with almost all the features of the flagship model. They wouldn’t need to compromise on performance or longevity. Plus people like me – who want the latest tech but prefer it in a more compact format – also got what we wanted. Sure, we lost 3D Touch and a barometer, but mostly it was a top-spec phone in more affordable and pocketable form. By all accounts, the iPhone SE has been a huge success. Back in September, it was still the third-best-selling smartphone even in the USA. And if rumors of a 128GB model this year are true, it seems that Apple knows that the SE isn’t just being bought by those wanting a cheap iPhone. Continuing to update the SE strikes me as the smart move here, allowing people to buy a brand-new, up-to-date iPhone at a lower price. Offering them instead a 2.5-year old model strikes me as less smart. Those phones are going to date faster, see performance degradation earlier, and in short deliver a less satisfactory user experience. And Apple is doing this at a time when Chinese brands are really getting their act together in the premium handset segment. Perhaps Apple has no choice. Maybe in China or Taiwan, size trumps performance, and the company has to offer at least a 4.7-inch model to compete. But I think it’s a dangerous approach even then. Budget buyers tend to hang onto their phones for longer, so Apple needs to think about how the iPhone 6 will be performing three, four or even five years from now. If those buyers find that the answer is ‘not well,’ the chances of them buying an iPhone next time around – when they perhaps have more money to spend – seem slim.

The best sleep tracking apps for Apple Watch and iPhone The top stories of the week on iDB LiberTV jailbreak for Apple TV 4 running tvOS 9.1-10.1 released   skip to main content skip to main menu     DigiTimes: iPhone 8 with in-screen fingerprint sensor entering mass production in September By Christian Zibreg, Mar 3, 2017 Tweet 6 Comments Rather than use one of the few readily available off-the-shelf fingerprint scanners that can be integrated into a smartphone display, Apple’s iPhone 8 will sport biometric fingerprint recognition via a custom-designed sensor, also embedded into the display. In addition, according to DigiTimes’ report Friday, the built-in fingerprint sensor inside iPhone 8 will replace Apple’s capacitive-based Touch ID fingerprint reader, as previously rumored. The handset is expected to enter mass production in September, claimed industry sources cited in the report. As per the report, iPhone 8 won’t use solutions like the Natural ID touch fingerprint sensor from Synaptics or Qualcomm’s Sense ID fingerprint scanning technology. Instead, the phone will sport Apple’s own algorithm based on its 2012 AuthenTec purchase that paved the way for Touch ID technology, as we know it today. That proprietary algorithm is said to rely on Privaris glass identification technology and biometric authentication systems such as ultrasound, according to industry sources. Prior rumors have indicated that rather than replace Touch ID completely, iPhone 8 should combine fingerprint scanning and advanced facial recognition into a more secure two-step biometric verification system. Subscribe to iDownloadBlog on YouTube Currently, Touch ID uses both a capacitive sensor that scans the finger touching the Home button and ultrasonic waves that read sub-epidermal skin layers. The new sensor for iPhone 8 should be manufactured on TSMC’s twelve-inch line using its 65-nanometer process technology (TSMC has been churning out existing Touch ID sensors). “Production for the new OLED iPhone is unlikely to start until September due to the redesigned fingerprint ID solution,” said the report. As for the iterative LCD-based iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus updates, they’ll enter volume production in July. It’s unclear from the report if the new sensor is limited to the rumored function area (imagined on images top of post) located at the bottom of iPhone 8’s display. Apple recently patented a solution that turns the entire screen into a fingerprint reader to keep the user automatically authenticated as he or she interacts with the touchscreen. It’s too early to tell if that technology will make its way into iPhone 8 because Apple often patents inventions that never see the light of day. Be that as it may, in-screen fingerprint sensors are now a reality. LG’s Innotek division, for example, revealed the world’s first commercial in-screen fingerprint sensor back in May 2016. As shown on the image above, cutting a shallow furrow of 0.01 inches (0.3 mm) thick on the lower backside of the cover glass has allowed LG’s engineers to install their fingerprint sensor behind the display. Leaked images and early hands-on videos of Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy S8 reveal a smartphone with a nearly full-screen front face and no physical Home button, fueling speculation that the next Galaxy flagship will have a fingerprint sensor that’s either embedded into the display or relocated to the back of the device.

Photographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg Apple Inc. sued Qualcomm Inc. in a U.K. court, adding to lawsuits across the globe in a sprawling battle over patents and licensing fees between the iPhone developer and the largest designer of mobile phone chips. A court document cites a claim on patents and registered designs. Court records don’t give further details on the patents involved or the company’s arguments. While court records indicated the filing was made March 2, Apple said the U.K. case was initially lodged Jan. 23. Qualcomm said it hadn’t seen the complaint and couldn’t comment on it. Apple is separately suing Qualcomm in California, accusing it of monopolizing the market for chips for wireless devices and withholding $1 billion in retaliation for cooperating with South Korean antitrust authorities. At the heart of the dispute between Apple and Qualcomm is a push by phone makers, with support of some regulators, to reduce the patent royalties Qualcomm charges. Qualcomm gets the bulk of its revenue from selling chips, but more than half of its profit from a separate licensing business. In response to a request for comment on Thursday’s legal filing, Apple referred to a statement the company issued when it filed the U.S. suit on Jan. 20, saying Qualcomm has for many years "unfairly insisted on charging royalties for technologies they have nothing to do with." "Qualcomm built its business on older, legacy, standards but reinforces its dominance through exclusionary tactics and excessive royalties,” Apple said in the January statement. “Despite being just one of over a dozen companies who contributed to basic cellular standards, Qualcomm insists on charging Apple at least five times more in payments than all the other cellular patent licensors we have agreements with combined.” The lawsuits add to a U.S. Federal Trade Commission antitrust suit against Qualcomm and investigations by the European Union and Taiwan. South Korea fined the company 1.03 trillion won ($902 million) in December over practices it said were monopolistic. Exclusive insights on technology around the world.

A more typical patent case would be for company A to file” cases in some countries “and then company B counter sues” in others. The U.K. case is: Apple Retail UK v.

Close share panel Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Sia is one of the most popular artists on Spotify Spotify has become the first music streaming service to pass 50 million paying customers. It reached the milestone after adding 10 million subscribers in less than six months, staying ahead of its closest rival, Apple Music. But Spotify - which costs £10 a month in the UK - faces competition from deep-pocketed tech giants Amazon and Google, as well as Apple. It is also yet to reach a new licensing deal with record labels, analysts say. Mark Mulligan, a music industry analyst at Midia Research, said: "Spotify is the standout success for streaming music globally - no one else comes close in terms of paid subscribers." Apple Music had about 20 million subscribers by December 2016, 18 months after launching. Lagging some distance behind are Deezer and Amazon Music, although the latter is "making up ground fast", Mr Mulligan said. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Rapper Wiz Khalifa performs at the Spotify best new artist awards The problem for Spotify is that Apple and Amazon have millions to spend on streaming and neither need to make a profit from the service, Mr Mulligan added. Google has also invested in its streaming service, Google Play Music, by making more songs available offline and using artificial intelligence to draw up better playlists. 'Tortuous talks' Spotify, which may list its shares on the stock market next year, is yet to post a profit despite reporting 80% growth in revenues in its latest annual results. The company is also still dealing with "tortuous" licensing negotiations with music companies, Mr Mulligan said. About 80% of Spotify's cash flow is currently spent on licensing payments to record labels, he said. "If it's going to IPO [initial public offering], it's at least got to have a good story about that." Image copyright Apple Music Image caption Apple Music has seen huge growth since it launched in June 2015 Spotify has rejected suggestions that its subscriber growth is slowing. The firm increased its paying customer base by a quarter between September 2015 and the start of this month, down from 33% in the previous six months. Spotify chief executive Daniel Ek said that needed to be "put in context". "More than absolute Netflix subs[criber] growth, and relative growth higher too," he wrote on Twitter on Friday. Netflix added 9.2 million paying members in the final six months of 2016, a growth rate of 11.5%. As Spotify expands, it will become more difficult to keep the growth rate up, but for now it is still enlarging the market and outpacing many of its rivals. "Spotify has a good shot at another really good year, but after that, growth might be harder," Mr Mulligan said.

Launched in 2008, Spotify had 40 million paid subscribers in September and the company tweeted the 50 million figure on Thursday, the same day messaging app company Snap Inc pulled off its massive share sale that bodes well for other technology companies considering a flotation. Apple, which launched its music service less than two years ago, had about 20 million subscribers in December and its entry looks to have done little to slow the rapid growth of its older Swedish-based rival. Spotify, which has yet to show a profit as it spends to grow internationally, is now looking at a possible stock market listing in the United States, online news portal TechCrunch said last month. A company spokeswoman declined to comment on Friday on when it might seek a listing. But a partner at a leading investor in Spotify, venture capital firm Northzone, said late last year the company could start to become profitable as early as 2017 after years of focusing squarely on "growth, growth, growth". Spotify is the most highly valued venture backed start-up in Europe and according to media reports is considering a listing on Nasdaq and potentially a dual listing on the Nasdaq exchange in Stockholm, where the company is headquartered. It was last valued at $8.53 billion, according to venture capital market research firm CB Insights. That valuation alone would make a flotation Europe's biggest technology start-up listing since the market launch of German e-commerce investor Rocket Internet in 2014. While still loss-making, Spotify has posted rapid subscriber growth since it was created a decade ago by Swedish founders Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzon. Following its announcement on Thursday that it had reached 50 million paid subscribers, Ek made a point of retweeting a comment from Wall Street media analyst Rick Greenfield which pointed to how Spotify was adding subscribers at an increasingly rapid rate. The Stockholm-based company also announced a major expansion in New York last month. One of Europe's most highly valued venture-backed start-ups, Spotify will move its New York office to the World Trade Center from the Midtown area of Manhattan, adding more than 1,000 new jobs. In 2016 Americans used on-demand streaming platforms, such as Spotify, to listen to 431 billion music tracks, Nielsen said in its U.S. year-end report.

Apple Watch | 02 Mar 2017 | Print  | Comment (8) New Apple Watch Stand Looks Like the 128K Mac by Julio Ojeda-Zapata I hadn’t planned to write about Elago’s W3 Stand, an Apple Watch charging stand in the shape of a classic 128K Macintosh. I mean, what is there to say? “It’s an Apple Watch charging stand in the shape of a classic 128K Macintosh.” The end. But I realized Elago had concocted something brilliant when a buddy last week bestowed the product upon me — a thoughtful gesture after a recent death in my family — and other friends around a taproom table erupted with delight and a bit of envy. I was even more surprised later that day when my wife spotted the accessory on my desk and went gaga over it. You must understand a couple of things about my wife: She does not own an Apple Watch, has no interest in ever getting one, and has never been steeped in Apple lore. She adores her MacBook Air, but only in a utilitarian sense. Yet, hovering and cooing over the W3, she told me she wanted one – just because. So did I when I first heard about it. After all, I own a nonfunctional 128K Mac, a decorative prop that has a place of honor in my home office right near my Power Mac G4 Cube. The Elago W3 fits right in at Julio Geek Central. I have the $14.99 tan-colored model that approximates the color of the original Mac. Elago also sells a $15.99 dark-gray version, which is a strange color choice in the Mac sense, but matches darker-colored watches and straps. The stand is a simple yet substantial little thing made of soft, sturdy rubber. It’s a mini-Mac, but with a vertical slot for the Apple Watch to slide in. Within the stand, there’s a circular cutout for Apple’s watch charging pad. The W3’s cable threads downward through the accessory and out the back, mimicking the look of the classic Mac’s power cable. The stand’s screen is just a cutout, so when the Apple Watch drops into place, its face becomes the actual, functional “Mac” display. The Apple Watch sits on its side, which activates Nightstand mode and transforms the W3 into a nifty bedside clock with a classic-Mac look and feel. It even has details such as a faux floppy-disk slot, complete with a tiny paperclip-eject hole, but no Apple logo that might attract legal attention. I’m using the Elago in the bedroom with a first-generation Apple Watch (my Series 2 watch charges up in my home office on the far-more-utilitarian Griffin WatchStand Powered Charging Station that also charges my iPhone). I put the original Apple Watch on my night table in Airplane mode to keep activity to a minimum and left it there as a permanent fixture. In fact, I am experimenting with using the Apple Watch strapless to heighten the classic-Mac effect: But I suspect the mini-Mac clock will quietly migrate to my wife’s side of the bed before long. That’s fine, anything to foster marital bliss. I hope whomever came up with this cute product at Elago got a bonus. And I wonder if sequels might be in the works — a Bondi Blue iMac charging stand, perhaps?   Fujitsu ScanSnap Scanners — Save your business time and money with our easy-to-use small ScanSnap Scanner line.

Reply Michelle Steiner  2017-03-02 22:14 I've had one for a few months. I have a 0.3 meter charging cable that plugs into a USB port on the clock on my nightstand, so I now have two nightstand clocks. But one looks like a 128K Mac. I think I'll put an Apple logo on it.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Apple’s iPhone 8 will do the unthinkable Image Source: Moe Slah, ConceptsiPhone Zach Epstein @zacharye February 28th, 2017 at 10:58 AM Share Tweet There are so many things that come to mind when you think of Apple as a company. It was a pioneer in the personal computing space, the iPod was a total game-changer, it reinvented smartphones in 2007 with the original iPhone, and its laptops and tablets remain market leaders to this day. A number of common threads are woven through all of those achievements, and some are more appreciated than others by Apple fans around the world. One of Apple’s less appreciated characteristics is the company’s “courage.” The company has never been afraid to make design decisions that fly in the face of convention and ruffle feathers in the process. This manifested itself most recently in Apple’s decision to nix the standard 3.5mm headphone jack on the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, which caused quite a bit of commotion ahead of the most recent iPhones’ debut last September. Now, however, a new reliable report suggests that Apple will walk back one of its recent courageous decisions with the iPhone 8. Don't Miss: WSJ says iPhone 8 will have a curved display, but I’m not buying it Early Tuesday morning, The Wall Street Journal issued a report that seemingly confirms one of the most widely reported rumors surrounding Apple’s upcoming iPhone 8. According to the paper, Apple will dump LCD display panels in its new flagship iPhone and instead utilize a flexible OLED display. While the headline of the report states conclusively that the iPhone 8 will feature a “curved display,” I personally don’t believe the speculation flying around right now is accurate, and I wrote about why earlier this morning. Moving beyond the iPhone 8’s display, there was another tidbit in the report that is, quite frankly, shocking if true. After switching from the company’s proprietary 30-pin connector to the newer Lightning connector less than five years ago beginning with the iPhone 5, the Journal says Apple is planning to dump the Lightning port on its new iPhone 8 and adopt the industry standard USB Type-C port instead. Woh. The move would obviously make plenty of sense. Apple now uses USB-C ports on its newer laptops for charging and other connectivity, and a USB-C port’s internal components are just as compact as the Lightning port. Apple could use USB-C in phones and tablets without having to worry about the devices being any thicker, and it would then have the same type of connector on its Mac and iOS devices. It just seems so odd considering the company’s history that Apple would actually adopt an industry standard. It’s almost unthinkable. But the WSJ has been a reliable source of Apple leaks in the past, and it would be fantastic to see the company finally adopt an industry standard so that accessories work across Apple devices and across other devices as well.

Shipments for the entire year grew 25% as new vendors entered the market and previous champions refreshed their product lineups.   "Like any technology market, the wearables market is changing," noted Ramon Llamas, research manager for IDC's Wearables team. "Basic wearables started out as single-purpose devices tracking footsteps and are morphing into multi-purpose wearable devices, fusing together multiple health and fitness capabilities and smartphone notifications. It's enough to blur the lines against most smart wearables, to the point where first generation smartwatches are no better than most fitness trackers.   "Meanwhile, smart wearables are also evolving," Llamas continued. "Health and fitness remains a major focus, but once these devices become connected to a cellular network, expect unique applications and communications capabilities to become available. This will also solve another key issue: freeing the device from the smartphone, creating a standalone experience."   Liamas added that "Apple Watch Series 1 and Series 2 proved to be a magnificent success for the company as it was the company's best quarter ever in the wearables market. The lower entry price point and the inclusion of GPS on the Series 2 along with a completely revamped user interface have helped the company grow its presence. Apple is one of the few companies that has been able to quickly refocus its watch to gain traction in the consumer market and has also been leading the charge on introducing the smartwatch category to the commercial segment."   Apple's CEO told analysts during their financial conference call on January 31 that "It was also our best quarter ever for Apple Watch. Both units and revenues with holiday demand so strong that we couldn't make enough. Apple Watch is the bestselling smartwatch in the world and also the most loved with higher customer satisfaction in its category by a wide margin.   Apple Watch is the ultimate device for a healthy life and it's the gold standard for smartwatches. We couldn't be more excited about Apple Watch."   The IDC blurs the line between cheap basic wearables and Apple's upscale Apple Watch. In such a mixed report it's all about volume and not value or profitability. In the 'volume game' Fitbit sold 6.5 million units to take first place. Apple, even at substantially higher prices, was still able to capture third place with shipments of 4.6 million. Apple doesn't officially publish the sales/unit volume for Apple Watch as it does iPhones, iPads and Macs and seen in the Unaudited Summary Data for Q1 2017 (Q4 2016 calendar).     About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

However it seems that we can expect the next massive legal battle Apple will be involved will be with Qualcomm as the company has expanded its lawsuit against the company in the UK. For those unfamiliar, back in January 2017 Apple sued Qualcomm and alleged that the company had withheld payment to Apple as a form of “extortion”. This was hot on the heels of the FTC filing their own lawsuit in which they claim Qualcomm had “forced” Apple to use its chips in their phones. The lawsuit was later expanded to cover China, and now it looks like Qualcomm will have to do battle against Apple in the UK as well. We’re not sure if the lawsuit against Qualcomm in the UK is based on the same grounds that Apple used in the US, but Bloomberg reports that Apple had point them towards a statement they issued on the 20th of January (the first filing) when asked to comment about it. Qualcomm has so far held their ground and refuted the allegations, and last we heard the company was even considering filing their own countersuit, but to date we have yet to hear anything about that.

Despite Kodi being an extremely popular media player app, it is imperative to install it via sideload method using Xcode, as it does not support traditional installation methods. The latest version of Kodi (Kodi 17) is compatible with the fourth-generation Apple TV aka Apple TV 4, which is running tvOS 9.0 or above. However, it is recommended to try installing it on the latest version of tvOS aka tvOS 10 for maximum compatibility. Users, who are running tvOS 9.1 or upwards on their Apple TV, will have to install Xcode 7.2 or higher on the Mac. On the contrary, you need at least tvOS 9.0 in order to install Xcode 7.1. Other versions of Xcode are recommended for this procedure. You will also need a USB-C to USB-A cable in order to connect your Apple TV 4 to your Mac computer via USB. Downloads Required Xcode for Apple TV 4 via Mac App Store iOS App Signer utility for Mac Kodi deb file for tvOS (latest version) Note: You can sideload apps using free versions of Apple Developer accounts, which will last for just one week. You will need to re-sign and re-sideload the app in order to continue using it after the expiry date. However, a full developer account ($99) will let you sign and sideload any app for up to one year. Steps to install or sideload Kodi on Apple TV 4 without jailbreaking Step 1: Connect your fourth-gen Apple TV to your Mac with USB-C to USB-A cable. Step 2: Open the Xcode app on your Mac and choose 'Create a new Xcode project' from the main Xcode screen. Now select tvOS > Application in the left menu and then choose Single View Application, and finally hit Next. Step 3: Type in the Product Name and Organisation Name of your choice and the bundle identifier field should auto-populate, once you have defined Organisation Identifier. For instance, you can enter "com.injen" as your Organisation Identifier field and the Bundle Identifier will now become "com.injen.kodipro" wherein kodirpro will be your product name. Step 4: After you have filled all the necessary fields, just hit Next to continue and then save the project to a desirable location like your computer's desktop. Step 5: On the main Xcode window below the Identity sub-section, you will notice an error message saying, "No matching provisioning profiles found." Just hit the Fix Issue button below the warning message and the issue will be resolved. Step 6: Now sign in to Xcode app using your Apple ID and password that's registered to your developer account. Now click the Add button once you have filled up your login credentials. If prompted, just select Apple ID from the drop-down box and click the Choose button to continue. Xcode will now process the data and create a provisioning profile. Step 7: Then choose Apple TV from the ensuing pop-up window and then launch the iOS App Signer app. Step 8: Once the App Signer app is open, choose an appropriate signing certificate. Then select the name of the project you created earlier using Xcode from the drop-down menu in the app. You can now browse and add the Kodi deb file. Step 9: App Display Name field can be left blank, if you do not wish to rename the app on tvOS Home screen. Step 10: Hit the Start button and the iOS App Signer will compress all necessary files together and generate an IPA file once the packaging process completes. Step 11: Return to Xcode main menu and then choose Devices option from the ensuing Window menu. Now select the connected Apple TV device from the left-hand section and hit the "+" button within the main interface under the Installed Apps heading. Step 12: Browse and select the Kodi IPA file which was created in Step 10, by using the iOS App Signer from Step 10. That's it. The package is now successfully installed on your Apple TV 4 and the Kodi app icon should appear on the home screen.

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish Study Finds That iPhones Have A High Failure Rate By Tyler Lee on 03/03/2017 04:47 PST Operating system stability is obviously an important aspect to consider when choosing which platform to use. Clearly an OS that isn’t stable isn’t very useful even if it were packed with the latest features and cutting edge technology, and unfortunately this is something that Apple seems to be lacking according to a recent study. According to the latest Blancco’s State of Mobile Device Performance and Health report (via Cult of Mac), they have found that Apple’s iPhones seem to be increasing in their failure rates, while the opposite seems to be true of Google’s Android platform. According to the study, Apple’s failure rates in Q4 2016 was found to be at 62%, versus the same quarter the previous year where it was at a very acceptable and somewhat impressive 15%. It turns out that this is in part contributed by the likes of apps such as Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat, which are the three most used social media apps that also happen to be some of the most unreliable apps around and faced frequent crashes. Blancco is basing this data collected from millions of iOS devices that underwent diagnostics testing. As for Android, Google appears to be improving on the platform as it was found that it went from 85% in Q4 2015, to 44% in Q1 2016, and 35% in Q2 2016. Of course your mileage may vary but if you are thinking of switching platforms, these numbers might be of interest to you. Filed in Apple >Cellphones. Read more about iPhone.

This model is technically ‘new’ as Apple never sold the iPhone 6 in a 32 GB SKU before; it debuted with 16/64/128 GB options. The 32 GB iPhone 6 is going on sale at select carriers in Asia as a low-end model; the device is not sold by Apple retail. The device is launching on Taiwan Mobile on March 10 and has been quietly available in China since late February … Try Amazon Music Free Apple is not selling the 32 GB iPhone 6, which is only offered in a gold casing, at retail stores or on its website. It continues to sell the iPhone SE as its low-end option which has better internal components than the iPhone 6, but does not have a larger screen. Whilst Apple is keeping quiet, Taiwan Mobile is pushing the ‘new’ iPhone as a special limited-edition promotion. It is advertising it as the cheapest iPhone ever to be offered on its network and is already accepting pre-orders. The carrier is selling the device for ‘free’ with a NT$1,399/month contract plan (about $45 USD) that lasts for 30 months. To compare, the iPhone 6 can be bought unlocked for between $300-$400 today in the United States. Of course, it’s impossible to compare exactly as the 32 GB storage option has never been available domestically. It isn’t clear if the 32 GB iPhone 6 will also be available to buy on other carriers in Taiwan or if it really is exclusive to Taiwan Mobile. It appears to be on sale at just one online carrier in China. Given how Apple itself has not announced this, it seems very unlikely that the phone will be made available in developed countries like the United States. With the only color option being gold, it also implies a targeted launch for price-conscious Asian consumers.
