PHOTO: REUTERS Apple became the first US company to top the $800 billion mark in market capitalization on Tuesday, slightly more than two years after it crossed the $700 billion threshold. The iPhone maker’s shares have gained 33 per cent this year and almost 50 per cent since the US election in November. The company represents about 4 per cent of the $21.7 trillion that makes up the entire S&P 500 . index. Apple accounted for as much as 4.9 per cent of the S&P 500 in September 2012 but is a smaller percentage now as the index as a whole has rallied more than 7 per cent this year. Apple CEO calls for more global trade with China “It’s just reflective of how powerful a franchise it is. It may be the most powerful franchise in the country today,” said Rick Meckler, president of LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey, whose firm does not own the stock. “Considering that it has a limited number of products, it has really dominated that market in a way that few companies have, and it’s been able to retain margins despite lots of competitors.” If Apple continues on its growth path, the company will top the $1 trillion market cap level later this year. Stock buybacks have also bolstered Apple shares, with the company reducing its actual share count by 20.9 per cent and the average diluted shares outstanding by 20.5 per cent over the past four years, according to Standard & Poor’s data. Is Apple building an iPhone-powered laptop? The median price target on Apple is $160, up from the $140 median three months ago. Shares closed at $153.99 on Tuesday. The closing market cap of $802.8 billion was larger than the economies of 45 of the 50 US states, topped only by Illinois, Florida, New York, Texas and California. Billionaire Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway has disclosed a stake of roughly $20 billion in Apple, said on Monday he had grown more fond of the company because he could “very easily determine” the iPhone maker’s competitive position “and who is trying to chase them.” Read more: Apple , iPhone , Latest Recommended Stories Here's when iPhone 8 is expected to be released Apple is widely expected to release the iconic iPhone 8 to mark the Tech giant’s 10th year anniversary this year Apple unveils updated iPad at lowest-ever price New model starts at 32 GB of storage and replaces iPad Air 2 WhatsApp just added cool features for iPhone users iOS users will now be able to ask Apple’s digital assistant Siri to read out their latest WhatsApp messages to them Facebook Conversations Leave Your Reply Below Click here to cancel reply.

[THE SOUTHEAST UNITED DAIRY ASSOCIATION INDUSTRY] spotlight HOME ALONE: Nutrition experts give advice for kids in kitchen By Teri Thornton Stepleton Lifestyle Editor May 10, 2017 Updated 2 hrs ago 0 Buy Now This recipe for Peanut Butter Whip with Apples is easy to scale up or down depending on how many snacks you need. Just stay with a ratio of four parts yogurt to one part peanut butter. [THE SOUTHEAST UNITED DAIRY INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION] Buy Now Apple pie isn't just for dessert. Try this quick and filling overnight oat bowl recipe to get your day started right. [THE SOUTHEAST UNITED DAIRY ASSOCIATION INDUSTRY] Yes, it's almost time for the 2016-17 school year to come to an end. While school's out, many working moms and dads opt to send their kids to day camp or off to stay with relatives. There are students who, after a lot of begging and pleading with parents, are spending their first summer home alone. Once, all the rules of safety are established and providing enough activities — including chores — to keep a student busy and from spending too much time in front of a television or computer screen, the next issue to address is mealtime. What will they eat for breakfast? Cold cereal? Toaster pastries? How about lunch? Another ham-and-cheese or turkey sandwich? Then there's mid-afternoon, when the snack attack hits. Chips? Cookies? Laura Marbury, nutrition affairs program manager with the Southeast United Dairy Association Inc., says it's not too early to be thinking about these things. "Think about keeping your fridge or pantry stocked just so they will have healthy items available," she said. "Keeping healthy, fresh foods available for them make it easier to stay away from chips and cookies and frozen pizzas."  Lakita Page, expanded food and nutrition education program educator with the Franklin County Extension office, agrees. "Parents should always have a variety of foods on hand in their pantry that are nutritious and healthy," she said.  But don't just assume that because you stock the pantry with healthy items, that kids will eat those items. "Take in consideration what healthy foods your kids might like first, then proceed from there," Page said. Both nutrition experts suggest assorted fresh fruits and vegetables, along with peanut butter, applesauce, low-fat or nonfat yogurt, low-fat cream cheese, whole wheat bread or pitas, whole grain cereals with no added sugars and low-fat or skim milk.  Other items to consider include pretzels, sunflower seeds, dried cranberries or cherries, cheese cubes, microwavable oatmeal and grits, ham cubes and fruits canned in 100 percent juice. Marbury says parents can do a lot of prep work ahead of time to keep the fridge stocked with foods kids will eat. "Rotisserie chicken is good," she said. "Parents can just pull the chicken from the bones and keep it in containers in the fridge for pita pizzas. Mom or dad could also brown lean ground beef the night before and make brown rice to make a beef burrito. All the kids have to do is put the prepared beef, rice, cheese and salsa in a tortilla and microwave it."  Portion control can be a problem with children, who often snack without realizing how much they are consuming while playing video games or watching TV. "Preparing items in individual self-closing bags with proper portion sizes can be a good idea," Marbury said. "If Mom or Dad, explains that this is for the whole week, make it last, the kids can learn portion size and control." Page suggests that parents could make a detailed chart of what the serving size of each snack and meal should be. "Parents could also try teaching their kids who to read the Nutrition Facts label on the back of each food product to know how much to get," she said. For kids who play hard, whether it's inside or out, an afternoon snack may be in order. "In the freezer, stock 100 percent fruit bars, which provide a serving of fruit and not pure sugar. If you have a simple blender, keep frozen strawberries or other fruit on hand for smoothies." Marbury said parents should begin at a young age teaching their children to be comfortable in the kitchen. "You want them to learn more about healthy ingredients and making meals at home," she said. "They need to know there are more than just fast-food options out there. Studies show that people who cook at home eat healthier." Parents should also teach safety first when introducing children to cooking.  Page provides basic rules all children should know when working in the kitchen: • Always wash your hands for about 20 seconds — sing "Happy Birthday" or the ABC song — before making or eating food. • Wash all fruits and vegetables with water before eating. • Use clean vegetable brush on firm-skinned fruits and vegetables. • Keep pets and book bags away from kitchen counters. •  Never turn on an empty microwave. • Read package directions carefully. • Germs grow quickly in foods that are not stored properly. Always store milk, lunch meats, eggs and yogurt in the refrigerator. Put these foods back in the refrigerator as soon as you use them. • Discard foods such as bread, cheese, jelly, fruits and vegetables that have mold spots or look bad. Fruits and vegetables that have soft spots should be thrown away. • When using the microwave, allow food to cool for several minutes before removing from microwave and before eating. And always use potholders to remove hot dishes from the microwave. The following recipes are from the Southeast United Dairy Industry Association Inc. For other recipes, go to southeastdairy.org.

Catalyst Multimedia Today's Paper Topics ePaper WealthCheck SEARCH Follow Home News Markets Companies Money & Banking Economy Info-tech Opinion Specials BLink Portfolio Stocks Forex Commodities Gold & Silver Today's Pick Portfolio Tracker Wall Street loses oomph but Apple crosses $800-billion mark comments   ·   print   ·   T+  ·   T- Tweet May 10, 2017:   The S&P 500 fell on Tuesday after edging up to an intra-day record high for the second straight session, while Apple became the first US company to close with a market capitalisation above $800 billion. Better-than-expected quarterly earnings from US companies and Emmanuel Macron's victory in the French presidential election on Sunday have given investors confidence, but valuations for US stocks are already higher than average. The hope that US President Donald Trump will cut corporate and personal taxes remained in focus for investors. “Earnings are improving and the potential for tax reform plays a big role. Why would you want to sell stocks here when you might get a tax break later on?” said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist for Robert W. Baird & Co. Apple rose 0.64 per cent to end at $153.99, giving it a market valuation of $802.9 billion, a first for a US company. Investors are optimistic the Cupertino, California company will mark the 10th anniversary of the iPhone by launching a model with suped-up features. “It's a real testament to what they've accomplished,” said Rick Meckler, president of investment firm LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey. However, he said Apple's massive size could hamper it's ability to keep growing. The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.17 per cent to end at 20,975.78 points and the S&P 500 lost 0.10 per cent to 2,396.92 points. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.29 per cent to close at a record high of 6,120.59, helped by Apple. After the bell, videogame maker Electronic Arts jumped 3.9 per cent following its fiscal fourth-quarter report. Four of the 11 major S&P sectors rose during Tuesday's session, led by consumer discretionary, while the typically defensive plays such as utilities and telecom services fell. Energy dropped 0.86 per cent on the back of falling oil prices. Shares of Valeant Pharmaceuticals jumped 24 per cent after the company posted its first profit in six quarters. Sturm Ruger & Company jumped 9.85 per cent, leading other gun makers higher after its quarterly report suggested a drop in demand after Trump's election may be bottoming out. Endo International, Office Depot and Marriott also rose after reporting better-than-expected quarterly earnings. Wayfair surged 20.73 per cent to an all-time high after the online furniture retailer revenue beat analysts' expectations. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.31-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.02-to-1 ratio favoured advancers. The S&P 500 posted 42 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 120 new highs and 59 new lows. About 6.7 billion shares changed hands on US exchanges, in line with the daily average over the last 20 sessions.

Beddit -- an app and sleep system -- is designed to monitor daily sleep habits through the iPhone. The device is a thin and flexible sensor designed to be placed under the sheet on the top of a mattress. Beddit has retained a customer support contact on its website, suggesting that the customer experience will not change, CNBC reported on Tuesday. The updated privacy policy on the Beddit website also states that it has been acquired by Apple. "Your personal data will be collected, used and disclosed in accordance with the Apple Privacy Policy," the updated policy reads. The related data like heart rate and respiratory data collected by Beddit can be shared with Apple's health app. "Sleep-tracking is an intriguing potential health application for the Apple Watch, as it explores new use-cases in the health and wellness market. An estimated 50 to 70 million US adults have sleep or wakefulness disorders," according to US-based public health institute Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. The Finland-based Beddit was founded in 2007 and has received about $3.5 million in funding. Earlier this year, Apple acquired "Workflow", a popular iOS tool that allows users combine the functionalities of various apps together to automate normally complex processes. --IANS qd/ruwa/ SEARCH More from Sify: talking point on sify news Latest Features Pakistan's betrayal hurts 56" Pakistan's BAT!

Apple will hold the keynote event on June 5 at 10 a.m. PDT in San Jose, California. The WWDC 2017 will consist of get-togethers, sessions and labs for developers, plus a keynote address. Last year, Apple unveiled iOS 10, which revamped iMessage and the Photos and Maps apps, along with other features. This year could include big announcements on the Apple TV, iOS 11 and the rumored Siri speaker. Read: Apple Original Content: Doc On 'Harry Styles: Behind the Album' On The Way Here’s a roundup of what Apple could announce in its Keynote event this June: Apple TV and tvOS 11 Apple is rumored to introduce new features for the Apple TV’s tvOS 11 update, which could be announced at WWDC. The new update will allow for multiuser use, Israeli blog the Verifier said last month. The feature will allow users to create their own profiles and have tailored content, and switch in and out of profiles, similar to Netflix. Apple TV users will be able to make their own profiles through an iOS device and by connecting their Apple ID. The update also will allow users to listen to their Apple Music content, view their iCloud photos and videos, and use their apps once their Apple ID is linked to the Apple TV. tvOS 11 will also come with a picture-in-picture feature, which will allow users to minimize the window of a movie or video to the corner of the screen and surf through another app. The rumored tvOS 11 updates could help Apple against competitors, like the Amazon Fire TV and Roku. Apple is also looking to break into live TV programming and could introduce a monthly subscription with its next update, the Verifier reported. Last month, it was rumored Apple was looking into selling a premium TV bundle that would include HBO, Showtime and Starz. Meanwhile, a Bloomberg report said in February Apple was testing a new Apple TV that supports ultra-high-definition 4K streaming. Siri Speaker Apple could introduce its rumored Siri speaker, a rival to Amazon’s Echo devices, during the WWDC keynote address.  KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said earlier this month there is an "over 50 percent chance” the speaker will be revealed at WWDC. Kuo also said the Siri speaker will have “excellent” acoustics performance, which will help it compete with Echo devices. The Siri speaker is rumored to cost more than the Amazon Echo and is expected to have a performance similar to the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S. iPhone leaker Sonny Dickson tweeted last week Apple was “finalizing designs for their Alexa competitor” and was “expected to be marketed as a Siri/AirPlay device.” Read: Unclear If Siri Speaker Will Have Display Screen Like Amazon's Echo Show iOS 11 Apple could also give fans a preview of iOS 11, which is expected to be launched in September alongside the iPhone 8, iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus. Rumors suggest iOS 11 will come with Theater Mode, which will provide users with limited access to a device and will dim the screen display to avoid annoying others at the movies. Apple Original Content The upcoming iOS 11 is expected to come with a revamped Music App that will better showcase Apple’s original video content, a recent Bloomberg report said. The company’s upcoming projects could be revealed at WWDC with information about iOS 11. Apple is expected to release as many as 10 original shows and documentaries by the end of the year, including will.i.am’s Planet of the Apps and Carpool Karaoke. Apple is also said to be working on documentaries about hip-hop labels Bad Boy Records and Cash Money Records and another about music impresario Clive Davis. The company recently released a trailer for its upcoming Apple Music documentary on former One Direction singer Harry Styles, which will stream Monday. The company is also expected to reveal macOS 10.13, watchOS 4, and developments in Apple Pay and Apple Music.

At that valuation, the investments will show a net initial yield of 10.65 per cent and equate to €119/sq ft. David McCarthy of Lisney is handling the sale of the two buildings, which extend to more than 5,675sq m (61,095sq ft) and produce a rental income of €808,000. The two blocks have a weighted average unexpired lease term of more than 3.92 years. Apple Operations Europe trades as a subsidiary of Apple Inc and has been based in Cork for more than 35 years. It employs more than 5,000 people in the city, where it operates from a variety of buildings totalling more than 400,000sq ft.

PHOTO BY EMILY RYAN By Emily Ryan, For Digital First Media Posted: 05/09/17, 5:18 PM EDT | Updated: 49 secs ago # Comments Caramelized apples top this tarte Tatin, which chef Jenny Young calls “really simple.” PHOTO BY EMILY RYAN Dessert’s not all you can give from the kitchen this Mother’s Day. Pamper mom with a homemade spa treatment like this easy body scrub, which will leave her smelling sweet and feeling relaxed. Easy Body Scrub Ingredients ½ cup coconut oil ½ cup brown sugar 1 teaspoon vanilla Instructions Combine all ingredients in a jar really well. Slather on skin in shower. Rinse well. RECIPE COURTESY OF CHEF JOANIE WHITE Of course, mom loves flowers, phone calls, handmade cards and heartfelt hugs, but this Mother’s Day, why not whip up something as sweet as she is? “Layered trifle with fresh fruit – that’s usually my go-to for her,” said pastry chef Holly Haas of Frecon Farms in Boyertown. “Especially because it’s May, and spring is finally here.” She arranges homemade cake, pudding and three types of berries. “It’s very rustic in how it looks,” Haas described. “You can put it in a glass bowl and see the nice cake and fruit and pudding all around. And it doesn’t have to be smooth like a regular decorated cake should be.” Advertisement So even the youngest bakers can feel proud. “It’s something they can handle with dad helping them,” she noted. While trifle’s an English tradition, Apple Tarte Tatin will have mom saying, “merci!” “I like it because it looks really impressive, and it’s really simple,” said chef Jenny Young of The Red House Catering and Love in a Bowl, Soups from The Red House — a Kimberton-based delivery service. A French friend shared the recipe, which is “always a winner,” she added. “Everybody ‘oohs’ and ‘aahs.’” Young, also an instructor at Cooking Spotlight in Phoenixville, caramelizes apples on the stovetop, then covers the skillet with pastry, slips it in the oven and finally flips the finished tart fruit-side-up. “Don’t try to rush the caramelizing,” she advised. “Give it time. Be patient. That’s always my advice in the kitchen anyway.” Top it with crème fraîche as “a nice foil to the caramelized apples” and see mom smile. Another dessert that’s sure to delight: a “bright” and “pretty” fresh fruit tart. “That’s one of my favorite things to do for Mother’s Day,” said personal chef Lynn Lampe Lindquist of Cook on Call, who teaches at Delaware County Community College and Valley Forge Flowers. “I tend to go toward fruit or citrus.” She combines lemon curd and pastry cream, topping the tart with glazed berries. “It should look like a gift. It should look like a little jewel,” Lindquist explained. “It just screams happiness!” Triple Berry Trifle Ingredients For cake: 2½ cups all-purpose flour 2¼ teaspoons baking powder 2 cups sugar 4 eggs 1 cup buttermilk ¾ cup vegetable oil 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 package instant vanilla pudding 1 pint fresh strawberries, sliced ½ pint fresh blueberries ½ pint fresh raspberries Instructions For cake: Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Spray 9-by-13-inch pan with pan spray and set aside. In a large mixing bowl whisk together flour, baking powder and sugar together until combined. Add in eggs, buttermilk, vegetable oil and vanilla extract and mix until combined. Do not overmix the batter. Once the batter is smooth, pour into prepared baking dish. Bake for 30 to 40 minutes until golden brown or a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean. Let cool before cutting into cubes and assembling. To assemble: Have instant pudding made ahead of time. Try replacing milk with heavy cream to give it a lighter and creamier texture. Start by layering the bottom of an 8-by-4-inch glass bowl with half of the vanilla cake cubes. Break apart the pieces as needed to fit. Then spoon 1/3 of the pudding on top of the cake layer and spread evenly. Sprinkle half of the fresh strawberries, blueberries and raspberries over the pudding layer. Repeat using remaining cake, pudding and fruit. Top with remaining pudding and fruit. Chill and enjoy! RECIPE COURTESY OF PASTRY CHEF HOLLY HAAS Apple Tarte Tatin Ingredients 5 or 6 Golden Delicious apples Pie crust or puff pastry sufficient for a 9- to 10-inch circle Juice of 1 lemon ¾ to 1 cup sugar 1 stick unsalted butter, plus a little more for dotting the top of the apples About ½ cup sliced dried apricots Instructions Note: If your skillet has a rubber or plastic handle, wrap the handle with two layers of aluminum foil before using. Line the base of an 8-inch heavy, preferably nonstick skillet with 1/8-inch-thick slices of unsalted butter. Sprinkle liberally with sugar, about ½ cup. Peel and cut apples into quarters. (I prefer Golden Delicious for this tart.) Place apples cut-side-up onto butter/sugar. Apples should fit together as closely as possible; it takes about 5 medium apples. Fill in any gaps with pieces of apple and sliced dried apricots, and cover the whole thing with thinly sliced apple. Squeeze a lemon over the top and place pan on medium/low heat, covered. Let it simmer undisturbed until the butter and sugar caramelizes and softens the apples. You can check by gently lifting one of the apple quarters and peeking to see when it gets golden and slightly browned. It will take about 20 minutes, but check carefully that it doesn’t burn. Roll out pie crust to a 9- to 10-inch circle. You can use puff pastry, or make your own flaky (but not puffed) pastry with 1¼ cups of flour, a stick of unsalted butter and iced water. Remove pan from heat, dot the top of the apples with butter, place pastry circle over the top of the apples, tucking the edges down to form a thicker rim. Be careful; it is hot! Prick the pastry all over with a fork, sprinkle with ¼ cup of sugar and place in a hot (380-degree) oven and cook until well browned. Remove from oven. Carefully place a dinner-sized plate over the pan, and with one hand holding the pan and one hand holding down the plate, very carefully flip it over so that the tart is now on the plate with caramelized apple-side-up. You need to do this while everything is still hot or the apples will stick in the pan. (If you want to make a few hours ahead and still serve warm, you can leave everything in the pan, and reheat gently on top of the stove until the caramel melts again, then flip onto a plate as described above.) Serve at room temperature or while still slightly warm with crème fraîche. This is also very good made with pears with the addition of some chopped almonds scattered on with the apricots. Often made in France with quince, but they are hard to find here. It sounds complicated, but is actually very simple. This recipe was given to me by a friend in the Bordeaux region of France many years ago. He would casually make it while everyone was having a pre-dinner glass of wine. Then it was just the right temperature in time for dessert! RECIPE COURTESY OF CHEF JENNY YOUNG Fresh Fruit Tart Ingredients 1 (9-inch) baked tart shell 3 ounces lemon curd 3 ounces pastry cream (a thick, creamy custard) Assorted berries such as strawberries, raspberries, blueberries Apple jelly Instructions Place tart shell on serving dish. Gently fold together the lemon curd and pastry cream. You should have no lumps. Spread mixture evenly in the tart shell. Starting at the edge of the tart shell, place the blueberries on the cream in a circle around the tart. Next, if the strawberries are small, cut off the root end and place the strawberry, cut side down, on the cream. If they are on the larger side, cut off the root end and slice in half lengthwise. Place the cut-side-down on the cream, arranging the strawberries close together. Fill in the gaps with raspberries and blueberries. Other fruit can be used such as kiwi and mango. Glaze the fruit with apple jelly that has been melted in a saucepot over low heat. Brush the jelly on the fruit with a pastry brush.

And it’s up 57,000% since its 1980 IPO. By Evie Liu May 9, 2017 5:03 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Apple has another accomplishment to brag about. Its stock closed at a record high $153.99 on Tuesday, giving Apple a stock market value of $802.88 billion. Apple becomes the first-ever U.S. company with a stock-market value over $800 billion. Stock-market value, or capitalization, is calculated by multiplying a stock’s price by the number of shares the company has. Apple shares have been driven higher in recent months on expectations for the next iPhone, due in September. Some other Apple stock facts: • Apple’s stock price is up 57,403% since its IPO in December 1980. • The stock hit the $10 billion threshold in 1999 and reached $50 billion in 2005. • Apple’s value is now up 7.5 times from a decade ago when the first generation iPhone was released. It took Apple more than two years to grow from its $700 billion valuation in 2015 to $800 billion today. The next goal? Apple would need to close at $172.62, a 12.1% gain, to reach $900 billion. A share price of $191.80 would bring its market value to an even $1 trillion. Big Picture: Apple is the first company to reach a stock market value of $800 billion.

Apple Acquired Beddit – What Is It? Home » Apple » Apple Acquired Beddit – What Is It? Posted By Jane Danes on May 9, 2017 | 0 comments Share the joy                 Source: http://www.beddit.com/ Apple just bought Beddit. It’s a company that makes a device that you can place on your bed sheet and mattress. Beddit is known to help in monitoring your vital signs while you’re sleeping. Apple hasn’t announced it officially. However, the purchase was first revealed when the privacy policy page of Beddit had been updated. On this page, it states: “Beddit has been acquired by Apple. Your personal data will be collected, used and disclosed in accordance with the Apple Privacy Policy.” But what is Beddit sleep monitoring tool? This sleep tracker isn’t designed to be worn. Rather, it’s meant to be placed in between your sheets and mattress. Thus, you don’t have to remember to wear it every day. With this tracker, you can evaluate the quality and quantity of your sleep. It’s thin, slot and flat so you won’t notice it when you sleep on it. It comes with a smart data transfer so that all results will be transmitted to the Beddit app automatically. It has the same features as Fitbit and other fitness trackers with sleep monitoring function. That is, it can monitor your resting heart and respiration rates. It also tracks the number of times you got up. The app is compatible with Android and iOS. With the uses of this device, it shows that Apple wants to improve its health and wellness tracking department. It’s surely trying to compete and takes on Fitbit, which is currently the leader in the fitness tracking arena. Even though the Apple Watch comes with a heart rate sensor, it still needs software and hardware to perform more tasks besides measuring or tracking heart rate. Is there a market for sleep tracking? Like it or not, there’s a market for sleep trackers. That’s because sleep is imperative in achieving good health. When you have sufficient amount of sleep, you can prevent diseases and improve the quality of life. When you sleep, your body works to maintain your physical and mental health. The quality and quantity of your sleep will affect how you feel when you’re awake. Unfortunately, not people are aware of the risks associated with sleep deficiency. The damage may not instantly appear, but it can harm your body over time. With that in mind, sleep is a huge business. In three years time, sleep technology is said to hit more than $70 billion. The demand comes from people who are sleep deprived. In fact, the CDC estimated that 70 million individuals in the US are suffering from wakefulness disorder. Thus, it’s natural for Apple to take advantage of it if it wants to improve the performance of its health and wellness department. Three years ago, the company hired Rob Rayman, a sleep researcher, to be part of the health team of Apple. As to how much the deal was, neither Apple or Beddit disclosed such information. However, the Beddit 3 sleep monitoring device is worth $149.95. And you can now purchase it directly from Apple’s store under iPhone accessories. The device is manufactured and developed in partnership with Helsinki Sleep Clinic, VitalMed Research Center and Markku Partinen, MD.

Beddit 3 Sleep Tracker Sleep tracking is one area of health data that Apple has heretofore shied away from. Apple Watch, for instance, doesn’t track your sleep out of the box. That’s in keeping with Apple’s position that Apple Watch is designed to be charged at night. There are third party products that track sleep through using your iPhones various sensors, and there are third party hardware companies like Beddit. Beddit 3 Beddit’s current flagship product is Beddit 3, a sensor that sits on your bed and reports to your iPhone through HealthKit. The iPhone app will also feed data to an optional Apple Watch app. The hardware sensor is $149.95, while the apps are free. As of this writing, Beddit hasn’t made an announcement on its website, but 9to5Mac noted that the app’s privacy statement was changed to read: Beddit has been acquired by Apple. Your personal data will be collected, used and disclosed in accordance with the Apple Privacy Policy. What Next for Apple Sleep Tracking? I’m delighted by this acquisition. Our own Jeff Gamet has used an earlier iteration of Beddit’s hardware sensor for some time and loves it. But what delights me is that Apple is getting into this industry. With the company’s focus on health tracking, sleep tracking has been a frankly curious omission. The question is what will Apple do with this acquisition? Will it continue to sell a standalone hardware sensor or integrate Beddit’s technology in existing products like (an improved) Apple Watch? The acquisition could also be an acquihire where Apple wanted the people to work on something tangential. My gut instinct is that Apple will both continue to sell a standalone sensor and incorporate sleep tracking in iPhone and Apple Watch.

(Shutterstock/File) Headlines about mass data breaches have become ominously routine, and yet password convenience still trumps security for most people. That's why, year after year, the world's most popular log-on remains "123456," a password so obvious it accounted for 17 percent of the 10 million compromised passwords analyzed by Keeper Security, which sells a log-in management service.  The answer, of course, is to get rid of passwords altogether. Biometric technology—especially fingerprint scanners—have been steadily replacing the need to type in a password, which can easily be guessed by hackers wielding smart algorithms. Now, with the world increasingly embracing voice-activated devices like the Amazon Echo and Google Home, companies are starting to create technology that recognizes a person's speech patterns. Facial recognition is starting to catch on as well.  “Our vision is to kill passwords completely,” says Dylan Casey, vice president of product management at Yahoo! Inc., which has suffered major security breaches. “In the future, we’ll look back on this time and laugh that we were required to create a 10-character code with upper- and lower-case letters, a number, and special character to sign in, much in the same way that today’s teenagers must laugh at the concept of buying an album on a compact disc.” The question is whether companies will be able to persuade people to switch to biometric log-ins and whether the new technology will prove any more resistant to hackers than the old-fashioned password. Apple popularized the fingerprint scanner by embedding it in the iPhone four years ago, subsequently baking the technology into the MacBook lineup. Now Microsoft is getting into the act. Last month, the company started to let the estimated 800 million people who use its Outlook.com, Xbox.com, Skype.com and other cloud-based features log on with a fingerprint scan on their smartphone if they so choose. By October or November this year “you'll be able to take your phone, walk up to your Windows 10 PC and just use your thumb print to log into your PC,” says Alex Simons,  who's in charge of products within Microsoft Corp.'s identity division.  Read also: Password service warns users to change their, yep, passwords The banking industry, long mindful of security, has adopted some of the most cutting-edge technology. The U.K. bank Barclays started letting wealthy customers verify their identity during telephone banking with their voices back in 2014, and rolled out an opt-in version to retail clients last year. “Our voice security works by taking a recording and analyzing the different voice patterns, the vocal tones, the pitch and the pace,” says Simon Separghan, who's in charge of Barclays' contact centers across the U.K., India and the Philippines. He said the bank is currently working to implement the technology into its mobile banking app. HSBC, Citi, Santander are also all starting to let customers use their voices to log into their telephone banking accounts. Face recognition is becoming more common as well. Lloyds Banking Group Plc. announced in April that it would trial Microsoft’s Windows Hello technology, which lets online users log into their web-based accounts by pointing their face at a computer’s webcam. United Services Automobile Association has enabled the same within its mobile app for smartphones, as has U.K. challenger bank Atom. Is the new technology hacker-proof? Barclays’ Separghan is sanguine about the bank's voice-activated log-in system and says there have been no breaches so far. “We're very confident that the system is as unique as your fingerprint," he says. "So whether or not people are doing impressions or tape recordings and playing them back, the system has the ability to detect that.” But Michela Menting, digital security research director at ABI Research, isn't so sure.  “With artificial intelligence you'll have machines that'll be able to clone human voices and maybe be able to pretend to be somebody else,” she says. In April, three developers from a Montreal AI startup released demos of their speech synthesis tool, Lyrebird, which they said could “copy the voice of anyone” with as little as a 60-second recording. They released audio samples of their work, which mimicked the voices of Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and President Donald Trump. Read also: Zuckerberg hacking serves as reminder to change passwords One of Lyrebird’s founders, Alexandre de Brébisson, who is studying AI at the University of Montreal, said his team’s motivation was to improve speech synthesis rather than anything nefarious. “We believe that vocal human-computer interfaces will become more and more widespread in the future and we want to make them better,” he said. Could his software be used to fool voice-based authentication? “We haven't tested our tech on those systems,” he said, “but we would not be surprised that our current technology can already fool those systems." Similar concerns have been raised about face-recognition. Microsoft says its Hello technology, now available in a range of Windows-based computers and soon to be tested at Lloyds Bank, Halifax and Bank of Scotland, uses infra-red sensors to build a reliable representation of a human face. The company says the technology can’t be fooled by holding up a photograph to the lens. But in March, reports surfaced that the facial-recognition feature of Samsung Electronics Co.’s new Galaxy S8 smartphone could be tricked exactly that way. In a statement, Samsung noted that users have several ways to unlock their phones and said facial recognition can only be used to open the Galaxy S8 and not to "authenticate access to Samsung Pay or Secure Folder."  Thirteen years ago, Bill Gates predicted the death of the password. It never happened because people cling to old habits and can't always afford the latest technology. To avoid alienating customers, the banks aren't insisting that they switch to safer technology but are letting them opt in. So though cheaper biometric sensors and smarter software have helped improve online security, Menting believes passwords may be around for another 50 years—kind of like landlines. “Until we have embedded devices in ourselves that can act as that password," she says, "I really don't see them losing the authentication war anytime soon.” Hackers are counting on it.  Tags : password,hacker,technology,digital,security follow JPLUS     Comments Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Companies Apple issues press invites for WWDC 2017 keynote on June 5; here're 7 most likely announcements At the WWDC 2017, Apple is expected to announce four new software platforms, including the iOS 11, which will power next-generation iPhones and iPads. Kukil Bora   May 10, 2017 07:27 IST Apple sends out media invites for WWDC 2017, which will be held in San Jose, California from June 5 to June 9.Apple Apple on Tuesday began sending out press invites to members of the media for this year's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC 2017), confirming that it would host a keynote presentation on June 5 at 10:00 am Pacific Time (10:30 pm IST). The keynote is scheduled to take place at the McEnery Convention Center in San Jose, California. As announced by Apple in February, the WWDC 2017 will take place from June 5 to June 9 in San Jose, marking a departure from the past editions of the event that had long been held at the Moscone Center in San Francisco. It will be the first time since 2002 that the company has held its annual developers conference in San Jose. Apple is expected to host about 5,000 developers and 1,000 engineers during the event, which is known for introduction of new software products. Those who cannot attend the conference will be able to watch it online through the WWDC 2017 website, and the WWDC app for iPhone, iPad and Apple TV. The McEnery Convention Center in San Jose, California.Apple Newsroom The WWDC 2017 is widely expected to take the wraps off Apple's four new major software platforms, including iOS 11, macOS 10.13, tvOS 11 and watchOS 4. In addition to these software packages, the iPhone-maker is also likely to introduce its much anticipated Siri smart speaker, a new smart home accessory which is expected to rival Amazon Echo and Google Home. KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo also said in a report last week that Apple would very likely unveil a Siri speaker, which may go on sale in the second half of this year. The Cupertino tech giant is also expected to use the event to announce a new iPad Pro, which could feature the company's A10 series of chips that debuted with the iPhone 7. While rumours are rife that Apple has been working on a significantly overhauled iPad, it's unclear whether the WWDC 2017 will witness such a device. The seventh most likely announcement during the upcoming event could be related to new MacBooks since Apple's popular 12-inch notebook computers with Retina display have not received any update in over a year. Apple is highly expected to launch three iPhones this year, including a 4.7-inch iPhone 7s, a 5.5-inch iPhone 7s Plus and the so-called iPhone 8 with an edge-to-edge OLED display. However, it's very unlikely that the company will make any relevent announcement about these handsets during next month's event.

On Monday, May 8, Beddit updated its privacy policy to reflect that that company had been acquired by Apple. “Your personal data will be collected, used and disclosed in accordance with the Apple Privacy Policy,” reads Beddit’s updated website, linking to Apple’s consumer privacy hub. The acquisition took place quietly and was made public by CNBC and MacRumors a day after Beddit updated its website. Beddit makes a $150 sleep monitor that you can place underneath your bedsheets and above your mattress to track how well you sleep at night. Beddit’s sleep monitor uses thin, flexible sensors that can pick up every single heartbeat and snore while you’re asleep. The system is currently available on Apple.com. [ Further reading: The best white LED smart bulbs ] Naps are the new energy drink. Beddit then creates a unique SleepScore by monitoring your sleep time, movement, heart rate, respiration rate, room temperature, and humidity. All that data is at your disposal via the Beddit Sleep Monitor iOS app, which can also tap into HealthKit to share the info with the Health app. In addition, Beddit also has a watchOS companion app that helps you track power naps and boost your SleepScore, but the Beddit page promoting its Apple Watch capabilities was taken down. According to Google, that page was up and running as recently as May 4. Why this matters: Beddit might seem like an odd choice for an Apple acquisition. After all, why might Apple want to own a company that claims that “naps are the new energy drink”? Although we don’t foresee Apple developing its own line of sleep-tracking devices, the iPhone-maker could make use of those thin, flexible sensors that can collect an impressive amount of information.  The fact that Beddit is no longer touting its watchOS companion app suggests that its technology might be incorporated into the Apple Watch. A natural fit, especially since Beddit has tapped into the gamification of sleep. Adding advanced sleep monitoring capabilities would make the Apple Watch the activity tracker that never sleeps.

A link within the app also directs to the Apple Privacy Policy.As of May 8, the Beddit privacy policy says the following: Beddit has been acquired by Apple. Your personal data will be collected, used and disclosed in accordance with the Apple Privacy Policy. The Beddit 3 Sleep Monitor, which can be purchased from Apple for $150, is a thin, flexible sensor that's designed to be placed under the sheet on the top of a mattress. It collects and analyzes sleep-related data like sleep time and efficiency, heart rate, respiration, movement, snoring, room temperature, and room humidity. All of the data collected by the Beddit Sleep Monitor is then made available to iPhone users through an accompanying Beddit iPhone app, which provides "personalized insights" and "customizable sleep coaching" to help users improve their sleep habits. According to the Beddit website, the device uses ballistocardiography (BCG) to measure the mechanical activity of the heart, lungs, and other body functions. When the heart beats, for example, the Beddit sensor can measure the mechanical impulse generated by the acceleration of the blood through the circulatory system. Based on the changes to the Beddit privacy policy, it appears Apple may have plans to continue selling the device and collecting health-related data from it, which could potentially be used to enhance future versions of products like the Apple Watch.Tags: Apple acquisition, Beddit Discuss this article in our forums » View on web 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   Source: Wochit News - 6 hours ago< > Embed Apple Buys Beddit To Bring You A Better Night Of Sleep 00:51 Apple just bought something that will help you snooze.

Brendan McDermid, Reuters The S&P 500 fell on Tuesday after edging up to an intra-day record high for the second straight session, while Apple became the first U.S. company to close with a market capitalization above $800 billion. Better-than-expected quarterly earnings from US companies and Emmanuel Macron's victory in the French presidential election on Sunday have given investors confidence, but valuations for US stocks are already higher than average. The hope that US President Donald Trump will cut corporate and personal taxes remained in focus for investors. "Earnings are improving and the potential for tax reform plays a big role. Why would you want to sell stocks here when you might get a tax break later on?" said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist for Robert W. Baird & Co. Apple rose 0.64 percent to end at $153.99, giving it a market valuation of $802.9 billion, a first for a U.S. company. Investors are optimistic the Cupertino, California company will mark the 10th anniversary of the iPhone by launching a model with suped-up features. "It's a real testament to what they've accomplished," said Rick Meckler, president of investment firm LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey. However, he said Apple's massive size could hamper it's ability to keep growing. The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.17 percent to end at 20,975.78 points and the S&P 500 lost 0.10 percent to 2,396.92 points. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.29 percent to close at a record high of 6,120.59, helped by Apple. After the bell, video game maker Electronic Arts jumped 3.9 percent following its fiscal fourth-quarter report. Four of the 11 major S&P sectors rose during Tuesday's session, led by consumer discretionary, while the typically defensive plays such as utilities and telecom services fell. Energy dropped 0.86 percent on the back of falling oil prices. Shares of Valeant Pharmaceuticals jumped 24 percent after the company posted its first profit in six quarters. Sturm Ruger & Compan jumped 9.85 percent, leading other gun makers higher after its quarterly report suggested a drop in demand after Trump's election may be bottoming out. Endo International, Office Depot and Marriott also rose after reporting better-than-expected quarterly earnings. Wayfair surged 20.73 percent to an all-time high after the online furniture retailer revenue beat analysts' expectations. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.31-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.02-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 42 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 120 new highs and 59 new lows. About 6.7 billion shares changed hands on US exchanges, in line with the daily average over the last 20 sessions.

Needs New Management Should Qualcomm bring in fresh leaders to solve its growing list of problems? Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) May 9, 2017 at 8:33PM Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) has been a tough stock to own over the past five years. Shares fell more than 10% as the NASDAQ doubled, as the chipmaker struggled with competition in mobile chips and ongoing attacks on its high-margin licensing business. Qualcomm has taken some steps in the right direction -- like expanding into chips for wearable devices, drones, connected cars, and other Internet of Things gadgets -- but expectations for the company remain low. Analysts expect its revenue to fall 3% this year and for its earnings to dip 1%. Image source: Qualcomm. At times like these, investors might wonder if Qualcomm would fare better under new leadership with fresh tactics. Let's discuss four big mistakes Qualcomm made under current CEO Steven Mollenkopf, and whether or not a new leader could fix them. 1. Failing to boost shareholder value Mollenkopf became Qualcomm's CEO on March 4, 2014. Qualcomm stock has declined 28% since that day, due to three major missteps. First, Qualcomm kept losing market share to Taiwanese chipmaker MediaTek's lower-end chips, while more OEMs -- like Huawei and Samsung -- started producing in-house chips. Second, Samsung dropped Qualcomm's Snapdragon 810 from its flagship Galaxy devices in 2015, reportedly due to overheating issues. Lastly, Qualcomm's licensing business was hit by a series of probes, fines, and lawsuits -- most of which claimed that its licensing fees (up to 5% of an entire device's wholesale price) were unfair, since Qualcomm's tech was only utilized in certain components. 2. Complacent dependence on a wobbly business model Mollenkopf and his predecessor, Paul Jacobs, should have prepared the company for these challenges by expanding earlier into adjacent markets. Instead, they seemingly believed that Qualcomm's high-margin licensing business could continually prop up its lower-margin chipmaking one without any long-term consequences. But as smartphone margins declined, OEMs cried foul and demanded lower fees. Many Chinese OEMs underreported shipments to pay lower licensing fees. Chinese regulators sided with those companies, slapping Qualcomm with a $975 million fine in 2015 and forcing it to renegotiate lower licensing fees with each company. That ruling sparked a similar $873 million fine in South Korea and a fresh FTC suit against the chipmaker earlier this year -- which claims that Qualcomm leveraged the strength of its patent portfolio to push mobile chipmaking rivals out of the market. Qualcomm realized that its profit engine was under fire, but it also couldn't skimp on R&D and marketing costs for its latest Snapdragon chipsets. This forced Qualcomm to spend more heavily (total expenses rose 16% annually during the first six months of 2017) -- even as total revenues dipped 3%. 3. Its escalating battle with Apple Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) also sued Qualcomm earlier this year, claiming that the chipmaker was withholding rebate payments (for using its baseband modems) for aiding the Korean FTC in the aforementioned probe. Apple also opposes Qualcomm's collection of licensing fees on the entire device's value. To further complicate matters, the FTC alleges that those payments -- which secured Apple as an exclusive Qualcomm customer from 2011 to 2016 -- were "bribes" that prevented Apple from using other baseband modems. Image source: Apple. Instead of defusing this toxic situation with one of its top customers, Qualcomm's management stood its ground and claimed that Apple violated the terms of its rebate agreement with its assistance in the Korean case. Apple then sued Qualcomm in China and started withholding all licensing payments to the chipmaker. The latter blow forced Qualcomm to slash its third quarter revenue forecasts by $500 million. The escalation of this battle might have been avoided if Qualcomm's management made concessions with Apple over their past five years of negotiations. Instead, Apple's move could now encourage other OEMs to stop paying licensing fees -- which would gut Qualcomm's licensing business. 4. Not heeding Jana Partners' advice Activist investor Jana Partners repeatedly warned Qualcomm about using its licensing business to support its chipmaking business, and pushed the company to split into two halves. The licensing business would be streamlined and be able to acquire more patents as the company handles all the probes and litigation. The stand-alone chipmaking business could either grow larger -- as it's doing now with the proposed buyout of NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI) -- or become a merger target for other giant chipmakers like Intel. Yet Qualcomm decided against a breakup in December 2015, and Jana wisely dumped most of its stake last February. Had Qualcomm's management heeded Jana's advice, the two companies might now be better insulated from antitrust charges. But will Qualcomm change its ways? I believe that Qualcomm would benefit from a management change, but I doubt that will happen in the middle of these probes and lawsuits and before the NXP deal closes. But after that smoke clears, the company might want to hire new leaders and reconsider Jana's suggestions about breaking up the company along its chipmaking and licensing lines.

Elyse Betters10 May 2017Speakers Apple-made, Echo-like smart speaker likely coming Reportedly now being tested in Apple employees' homes Will feature support for Siri voice commands Might also have built-in facial recognition tech Expected to be announced at WWDC in June 2017 Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment Apple is working on its own Amazon Echo or Google Home-like device, according to several reports from the last few months. These reports have claimed that Apple is already testing the product inside Apple employees' homes, and that we may see the device, which is expected to come loaded with support for Siri voice commands, introduced at WWDC 2017 in June. Here's everything you need to know about the speaker so far, including how it might look and what it might feature. Just bear in mind that nothing is confirmed as of yet. Apple's Siri speaker: What could it be? 64 ways to get a giggle out of Siri Apple has been rumoured to be working on an Amazon Echo or Google Home-like smart speaker since early 2016, around the same time Google introduced its Home speaker and around two years after Amazon launched its popular Echo. Although there has been no confirmation from the company, several reports have surfaced in recent months about the device and how it might differ from rival products. Apple employees have reportedly been testing the speaker inside their homes for several months, according to Bloomberg. The publication also reported last September that Apple engineers had begun in-home testing of prototypes. In other words, if this is true, we're likely getting closer to an actual unveiling of the product. And many reports are pointing to WWDC 2017 as the perfect venue to announce it. Apple's Siri speaker: What can you expect? Apple finalising plans for Amazon Echo-like device to control your home Siri voice commands The Information first reported in May 2016 that Apple is working on Echo-like device that could obey voice commands through Siri. The report, which was published prior to WWDC 2016, also explained that Apple planned to open up its Siri assistant to outside app developers by releasing an SDK. The company, of course, did just that, in June 2016, allowing app developers to make their apps accessible through Siri. Facial recognition CNET also reported in May 2016 that Apple is working on Echo-like device, but it said the device could know who you are just by looking at you. The device will feature a built-in camera and will come in the form of a smart speaker. It'll be "self aware" and detect who is in the room using facial recognition technology. Doing so would allow it to automatically pull up a person's preferences, like music. Early prototypes of Apple's upcoming speaker, the so-called Siri speaker, for lack of a better name, are said to have included facial recognition sensors, using technology Apple acquired when it bought both Faceshift and Emotient in the last couple of years. It's also been suggested that Apple's speaker could trump the Amazon Echo by featuring more advanced microphone and speaker technologies. Touchscreen It’s unclear if Apple’s Siri speaker will feature a display - sort of like Amazon’s new Echo Show. It might just be all about audio - like the regular, cylindrical Echo speaker or Google Home. However, Apple executive Phil Schiller recently talked about gadgets with screens rather favourably: “The idea of not having a screen, I don't think suits many situations,” Schiller said in an interview with Gadgets 360 in May 2017. He noted voice-only assistants can’t show you photos posted to social media, and if you’re asking for directions, you can’t see them on map. “I think voice assistants are incredibly powerful. Their intelligence is going to grow. They're gonna do more for us, but the role of the screen is gonna remain very important to all of this,” he explained, while also making it clear he is unimpressed by existing smart speakers. “My mother used to have a saying that if you don't have something nice to say, say nothing at all,” Schiller said. Airplay product In April 2017, it was reported that Apple's Siri speaker designs were in the final stages. According to Sonny Dickson, who has hit the nail on the head many times in the past when it comes to leaking Apple news, the company is "finalising designs" for its Echo competitor after two years of development. Posting on Twitter, he added that any device will be marketed as a Siri/Airplay product. Homekit It's also been reported that Apple's Siri speaker will allow you to control your smarthome kit through Siri voice control.

By: Banikinkar Pattanayak | Published: May 10, 2017 6:50 AM The minister said the very existence of the H-1B visa system in the US suggests there is a genuine shortage of skilled professionals in certain sectors there and that US companies have gained the most from this system. Commerce and industry minister Nirmala Sitharaman says the US decision to keep India in its priority watchlist on intellectual property rights (IPRs) is a unilateral move that India doesn’t recognise. She says the country will continue to engage with China on containing the huge trade deficit with the giant neighbour. In an interview to FE’s Banikinkar Pattanayak and Shobhana Subramanian, the minister said the very existence of the H-1B visa system in the US suggests there is a genuine shortage of skilled professionals in certain sectors there and that US companies have gained the most from this system. Edited excerpts: Apple has set a pilot project near Bengaluru but its larger India plans depend on incentives to be granted by the centre. Have you reached a decision on the company’s request for various concessions? There is no new request and the finance ministry has already voiced its opinion on the earlier request. Earlier, we (relevant ministries such as commerce and industry, finance, electronics and telecommunications and environment) had a joint meeting where inputs were shared. After that, Apple executives had met the finance secretary as well. So there is nothing new to say now. (MeitY has endorsed the revenue department stance that Apple’s demand for an import duty exemption for certain components for making i-Phones in India can’t be met.) Has the government decided on proposals of Amazon, Big Basket and Grofers for investing a total of $695 million in food retail here? The proposal hasn’t yet come to me. But our position is clear: up to 100% FDI will be allowed, via the government route, in the marketing of food products produced locally. When PM Narendra Modi goes to the US (likely in June or July), will he take up the issue of the US retaining India on its priority watch list on IPR? I am not aware of the agenda of the Prime Minister’s visit. But our position on the IPR is clear. We don’t recognise any country putting another country on their watch list. Nobody should be taking the authority to be a watchman of somebody else’s policy. It’s a completely unilateral move by the US administration. The US was also consulted, as part of our talks with various stakeholders, before our new IPR policy was announced last year. Also, we have said it time and again that our IPR policies are completley TRIPS-compliant (in accordance with the World Trade Organzation standards) and our legislative system is very robust. Our courts have held the rights of people who have got the patents. Not once has this government taken a step that would add to such misplaced concerns about our IPR regime. Much before we came to power, only one compulsory licence was granted in public interest. So I don’t find any basis of the anxiety about our IPR system. We have a huge trade deficit with China despite efforts by successive government to curb it. How are we going to address the issue? We have to continue to talk to China on giving us a greater market access on several products where we are competitive. And those technical speed-breakers, including non-tariff issues, have to be addressed by China. I look at the entire issue with China from two angles: one pertains to our direct bilateral concerns (such as our trade deficit with China, demand for greater market access there and better and easier rules for our products) and the other relates to the issue of massive capacity there and its resultant impact. The market access is a key issue. Despite having FDA approvals, our pharmaceutical companies still find it difficult to tap the Chinese market. Our IT companies, too, are struggling to make inroads into that market due to cumbersome processes, while their smartphone makers come here and set up units easily. So we hope to continue these discussions with them. Merchandise exports touched a six-and-a-half year high in March. Will the latest surge continue, given the tepid external headwinds? Global trade climate isn’t giving any indication that it will improve soon. That said, I would stress that the Indian exporters have been very smart in finding new markets and expanding there, while consolidating position in existing markets. As a result of this, we see a very significant improvement in our export performance. So I don’t think the recent surge in exports is an extraordinary blip that will disappear. I think we are going to sustain this performance. Based on the feedbacks from exporters, I think they are very sure about a resurrection in exports. But what about services exports, given the rise of protectionism in key markets like the US? Our services sectors, especially IT, are completely seized of these challenges, particular with regard to the H-1B visa issues in the US. When you look at the top 50 companies that have benefitted the most by the H-1B visa system, most of them are US companies. Also, the fact that H-1B visa system is used to get workers from abroad indicates there is a genuine shortage of skilled professionals in certain services sectors there. Otherwise, if they really have adequate number of high-skilled professionals in those areas, why would a company, whether it’s Indian or American,would want to get workers from outside? It’s not wage arbitrage. We have raised this issue with the US earlier, and we will be raising it again. S Scott Wilson May 10, 2017 at 12:38 pm "Otherwise, if they really have adequate number of high-skilled professionals in those areas, why would a company, whether it’s Indian or American,would want to get workers from outside?" Why? This proves there are indeed dumb questions. H1bs earn, average, 40 less than an American in the same position. It's all about money.

Better-than-expected quarterly earnings from US companies and Emmanuel Macron's victory in the French presidential election on Sunday have given investors confidence, but valuations for US stocks are already higher than average.

Apple topped the $US800 billion market cap mark. Photo: George Frey The hope that US President Donald Trump will cut corporate and personal taxes remained in focus for investors. "Earnings are improving and the potential for tax reform plays a big role. Why would you want to sell stocks here when you might get a tax break later on?" said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist for Robert W. Baird & Co. Apple rose 0.64 per cent to end at $US153.99, giving it a market valuation of $US802.9 billion, a first for a US company. Investors are optimistic the Cupertino, California company will mark the 10th anniversary of the iPhone by launching a model with suped-up features. "It's a real testament to what they've accomplished," said Rick Meckler, president of investment firm LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey. However, he said Apple's massive size could hamper it's ability to keep growing.

The Nasdaq Composite added 0.3 per cent to close at a record high of 6120.59, helped by Apple. After the bell, videogame maker Electronic Arts jumped 3.9 per cent following its fiscal fourth-quarter report. Four of the 11 major S&P sectors rose during Tuesday's session, led by consumer discretionary, while the typically defensive plays such as utilities and telecom services fell. Energy .SPNY dropped 0.86 per cent on the back of falling oil prices. Shares of Valeant Pharmaceuticals jumped 24 per cent after the company posted its first profit in six quarters. Sturm Ruger & Company jumped 9.85 per cent, leading other gun makers higher after its quarterly report suggested a drop in demand after Trump's election may be bottoming out.

From the campaign trail to the Oval Office, Trump has criticized tech giants like Apple that have tried to rebuff federal requests for greater access to their customers’ data and devices. Meanwhile, the president has appointed a number of key individuals to national security posts who want to expand government’s snooping programs. Ultimately, Trump fired Comey on Tuesday because of the way he handled an investigation into Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton’s emails. And his departure is unlikely to draw many tears in the tech industry or beyond. His absence, however, still raises new questions about how Trump’s FBI might soon approach a host of critical digital privacy debates, including encryption. “Comey has definitely been bad on human-rights issues,” said Amie Stepanovich, the U.S. policy manager for Access Now, a public-interest group that advocates for surveillance reform in the nation’s capital. “He’s been in favor of expanding surveillance powers. He’s been in opposition to critical digital-security tools, like encryption. We’ve definitely had several run-ins with him.” Stepanovich told Recode on Tuesday that Trump has an “opportunity to appoint an FBI director that would be considerably more in favor” of strong privacy rights, for example. But, she stressed, Trump has “consistently appointed officials that support gross expansions of government authority at the expense of individual rights. So I think we can look on the potential new FBI director and be worried about who Trump is going to recommend for that position.” After taking the top FBI post in 2013, Comey found himself in a number of high-profile clashes with the tech sector and some of its allies. He initially defended some government programs to collect and analyze telephone and email records, for example, even after the disclosures of mass surveillance by Edward Snowden in 2013. And he repeatedly sought to expand the bureau’s power to root out suspects and criminals who communicated digitally under cover of encryption. Notably, Comey brought a case against Apple in 2016 after it refused to unlock a password-protected device tied to the San Bernardino terrorist attack. To that end, the likes of Apple, Facebook and Google often challenged Comey and his allies in the Obama administration directly. They lobbied intensely on Capitol Hill — and filed no shortage of court challenges — to battle back the FBI’s attempts to expand its ability to access some data and devices. And in the aftermath of Snowden’s leaks, they launched a coalition, called Reform Government Surveillance, to press for reform of the NSA. For these companies, their push to rein in federal law enforcement wasn’t just meant to assuage privacy-conscious customers: It was about satisfying foreign governments and business partners, which had grown skeptical of Silicon Valley’s ties to the U.S. government. Now, however, the tech industry must confront a new challenge: A White House that has still-evolving views on surveillance issues, as well as new faces running key federal agencies — including, soon, the FBI. Dating back to the bruising 2016 presidential campaign, at least, Trump has struck a hard line on issues like encryption. During Apple’s fight that summer with the FBI, then-candidate Trump blasted the iPhone giant’s chief executive, Tim Cook, and even called for a boycott of the company. Since winning on Election Day, though, Trump has appointed officials to key national security posts that share a belief that government should expand its ability to pursue potential threats. Trump’s attorney general, for example, similarly has criticized Apple for its strong defense of encryption. While Jeff Sessions represented Alabama in the U.S. Senate in 2015, he also voted against a law that reined in some of the National Security Agency’s surveillance powers. A year later, Sessions sought in Congress to expand the FBI’s ability to collect information like web browsing histories during emergency cases without first requiring a warrant. That ultimately failed. But the larger privacy debate — whether law enforcement should have to obtain warrants to access Americans’ oldest emails for their investigations — remains an unsolved issue on Capitol Hill. There’s also Mike Pompeo, the director of the Central Intelligence Agency under Trump, who similarly sits in opposition to the tech and civil-liberties crowds. An Army officer who later served in the House of Representatives, Pompeo regularly — and vocally — opposed efforts to curtail U.S. surveillance authorities. And Trump’s director of national intelligence, former Sen. Dan Coats, similarly has voted against surveillance reform. For tech giants and civil-liberties advocates, Trump’s still-forming team is all the more important in 2017, as one of the NSA’s most critical programs is set to expire at the end of the year. The provision of surveillance law known as Section 702 allows intelligence officials to collect phone and internet data in bulk from overseas, and some companies and groups want to narrow those powers to ensure Americans’ communications aren’t swept up. Congress is still debating the future of that law, but the Trump administration surely will have a say — including, potentially, its new FBI director. “Whether the next person adopts those views or not, or whether they take a position that is much more responsive to those [privacy] concerns, I just don’t know,” said Neema Singh Guliani, a legislative counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union. In an interview, she also stressed Comey’s record has been concerning — but that the Trump administration’s approach to privacy and security remains unclear. “I think that if we look at the appointees to date, many of them have had very concerning positions on surveillance,” she said.

The acquisition was disclosed when Beddit updated its privacy policy this week, which now notes: “Beddit has been acquired by Apple. Your personal data will be collected, used and disclosed in accordance with the Apple Privacy Policy.” The acquisition could fill a gap for Apple in its digital health portfolio as its competition with health-tracking pioneer Fitbit heats up. The Apple Watch, which analysts estimate outsold Fitbit’s devices for the first time in the last quarter, is generally charged overnight as its battery life only lasts a day, which means it is not ideally suited to tracking sleep. Fitbit’s products, on the other hand, have multi-day battery life and so are often used for sleep monitoring. A source familiar with the deal said that Beddit users’ experience would be unaffected by Apple’s acquisition, noting that its customer support line was still operating. The latest Beddit 3 product is still listed for sale in Apple Stores, although it is out of stock on Amazon.com, which had also carried the item. It is unclear whether Apple plans to continue selling or supporting the device indefinitely or incorporate its technology into a future Apple-branded product.

(AAP Video) More videos Cheaper credit cards Will consumers be smart enough to use new, cheaper credit cards coming out, or will they be caught by the "lazy tax?" Michael Pascoe comments. If you apply for a bunch of cards in a short period of time - whether to research, compare credit limits or load up on frequent flyer points - multiple inquiries will appear in your history, diminishing your credit score and, therefore, ability to obtain a loan in the future. Therefore, it's important to only use information that is publicly available. Related Content Taking the government's advice cost me my credit rating Good savings all about the little things Paul Abbey, former head of unsecured lending at NAB, said these black marks suggested to lenders that the consumer is struggling financially and hungry for credit, being rejected by other lenders, or even trying to defraud credit providers. There is no way for the lender to know what's happened after each inquiry - even if the customer doesn't proceed. Advertisement "Even if you apply for the sake of research, those inquiries will make you look like everybody's knocked you back and you're desperate," said Mr Abbey, now at peer-to-peer lending start-up MoneyPlace. "You have to use and compare the information in the public domain, because you've gone too far if you've filled in your details and hit the submit button." SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Usually, it's good to "shop around". But be careful when you're comparing credit cards. Photo: Greg Newington The warning is even more salient today with the growing ease of acquiring credit cards. Lenders are increasingly making the application process quick and easy and promising to respond with a decision within 60 seconds. Following legislative changes, credit providers can now give "positive" data to credit reporting bureaus such as Equifax and Experian, including repayment histories. SHARE Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Link A low credit score can affect your chances of approval when applying for a credit card or loan. Photo: Rebecca Hallas But Mr Abbey said it was highly unlikely that inquiries will ever be attached with further information to show the customer's intentions and outcomes. Multiple inquiries will continue to indicate financial stress. "The privacy legislation doesn't allow banks or providers to share the result of an application - even if the customer withdrew from the process," he said. "On the flipside, Treasurer Scott Morrison said in his budget speech that the government is supporting a recommendation from the Productivity Commission and will legislate a mandatory positive credit reporting regime if a threshold test is not met by the end of 2017," he said. "This is great news for consumers, as their repayment history will begin to be shared and they could leverage their positive credit reporting data to drive better deals from banks and providers." Credit scores can sit between zero to 1200, and reflect a person's credit worthiness, based on factors such as the amounts borrowed, defaults and court orders. The lower it is, the harder it will be to obtain a loan. Belinda Diprose from Equifax, formerly called Veda, urged consumers to examine their credit file and check if there are any anomalies. Australian are legally entitled to access their credit report for free once a year. She said legitimate inquiries can't be erased, but will automatically expire after five years. "If you see an inquiry but you didn't apply for anything, it may be a sign the someone has stolen your identity, and that's a case definitely worth investigating," she said. Mr Abbey said in some cases a credit provider could have had processing issues, leaving multiple inquiries on a file. Ms Diprose also warned that another pitfall was in-store finance, for example, to buy a fridge at Harvey Norman. This will also trigger an inquiry that will be recorded on a customer's credit file. "If you're buying a fridge interest-free, there will be an application as part of that and there will terms and conditions that generally includes a piece that says your information can be checked with a credit reporting body, and so as soon as you've signed that, that will lead to an inquiry."

This is the building where Apple will create its next big thing. Aerial footage recorded this month by Duncan Sinfield shows "final touches" being put the Apple Campus in Cupertino, California.  The half-a-kilometre wide Apple "Spaceship" that will soon be home to 12,000 employees is set to be the world's next architectural icon. Four months before his death in 2011, Jobs's final public event was not standing on a stage promising "one more thing" as he might have wished but rather sitting at a desk putting the case for the new Apple campus to the Cupertino council in California. Built alongside the 280 freeway, on the site of a former Hewlett-Packard headquarters, Jobs told the council of his vision. "We do have a shot at building the best office building in the world," he said with trademark hyperbole. "It's a little like a spaceship landed." Apple, in typical secretive fashion, has not put a price tag on the building's construction, although a figure of $6.5 billion has been widely reported and not disputed. Nicknamed the Spaceship during its construction, the 70 hectare site has been formally named Apple Park. Its details are stunning at both ends of the scale, from the world's largest panels of curved glass that make up the walls to the smallest details such as the design of the door handles that reportedly took 18 months of meetings to choose and involved measurements down to the nanometre. Reports of the brief to the building's architects show how Jobs's insistence on perfection in design has extended from Apple's products to its headquarters. No seam, gap, or paintbrush was allowed to show; every wall, floor and ceiling had to be highly polished and the timber used in fittings had to be a specific type of maple and only the timber from the heart of each tree was allowed to be used. The 6km of glass used on the exterior walls was bent and framed in Germany, using machines specially designed for this project, and then shipped over. The campus is more than just the iconic four-storey high ring of glass. The closest most Australians will come to Apple headquarters will be footage of Tim Cook standing on a stage unveiling the next iPhone, in the 1000-seat Steve Jobs Theatre built underground a man-made hill beneath a glass cylinder entrance that is a 6m high and 50m wide. Apple's fitness focus, which is evident in the Apple Watch, extends to the building with a "wellness centre", reportedly costing nearly $100 million, able to cater for Apple's 20,000 employees who work in Silicon Valley. The British architect firm Foster+Partners who designed the building also boast major projects including Wembley Stadium, London's Millennium Bridge and New York's Heart Tower. Foster+Partners chairman Norman Forster has said the inspiration for the design was a London square where houses surround a park, although Jobs's appreciation of the Main Quad at Stanford Campus is also cited as a reference point. The main building has a 17-megawatt solar rooftop, making it one of the largest on-site solar energy installations in the world.   It is also one of the world's largest naturally ventilated buildings, designed to run for nine months of the year without heating or cooling. The site is 80 per cent green space and has been planted with 7000 native and fruit trees including 1000 trees dug up on site and stored during construction. apple Read More Login to follow editors picks Read More Login to follow games and gadgets Read More Login to follow iphone Read More Login to follow technology Read More Login to follow Topics:  apple editors picks games and gadgets iphone technology Related How to see your phone's secret record of everywhere you've been Apple tipped to launch Siri home speaker Apple iPhone 8 may not come out this year

Unsurprisingly this includes Amazon’s own music services, as well as Spotify and Pandora (which is apparently in the process of selling itself). So what about other services such as Apple Music? Unfortunately there is no support for Apple Music at the moment, but in a report from Bloomberg, Amazon’s Dave Limp doesn’t seem to be opposed to the idea. Limp was quoted as saying, “We’d love to have Apple, but they’re not super big.” It’s an interesting statement especially when you consider that Apple Music is still relatively young compared to the competition, but has already racked up more than 20 million paid subscribers, but perhaps it isn’t quite big enough for Amazon to consider integration. That being said, Apple Music subscribers can still stream songs through the device, it’s just that they’ll need to pair their iPhone or iPad to the Echo and stream it from their phones instead. It isn’t a terribly inconvenient workaround but having native support is always a welcome one. Filed in Apple >Audio.

Whether or not that is true remains to be seen, but in a report from Mark Gurman over at Bloomberg, it seems that this device has been in testing for the past few months. According to the report, Apple employees have reportedly been testing the Siri device in their homes for the past several months, indicating that things are progressing rather nicely and that we could be close to seeing it launch. However the report from Bloomberg can’t confirm if this device will have a screen similar to the recently launched Amazon Echo Show. However Apple’s SVP of Marketing Phil Schiller recently mentioned that there are benefits to having a screen on a voice-activated device, so maybe it is possible that it could end up sporting a display, or maybe Schiller could simply be talking about a future model, or maybe just speaking generally. In any case we guess we’ll have to wait and find out, but with Amazon, Google, and even Microsoft getting into the smart speaker game (with the launch of the Harman Kardon Invoke), what would be surprising is if Apple did not have an answer.

While a new model comes out every year and loyal Apple customers will pay an arm and a leg for it, that's not the story in some emerging markets. Apple still actively manufacturers older models that it sells for heavily discounted prices. According to a recent report out of India, Apple is planning on selling its 2013 iPhone 5S in India for around $230. India's population is young and has become more affluent and tech savvy. With help from considerable upgrades to India's wireless infrastructure, smartphone sales have grown by about 15% in the first quarter of this year. That's nearly 10% higher than the global average. Despite what it seems like from walking around in America, Google's Android still holds the lion's share of the smartphone market. This is especially true in emerging markets where they are able to sell very cheap phones to many first time phone owners. While India's average household income is growing, it's still far below that in America. Because of this, Apple simply can't charge $700 for a smartphone there if they want them to sell. That being said, smartphone prices rose in India by about 3% last year which could indicate that consumers are looking for a more premium experience. This is the market Apple is hoping to capitalize on. While $230 is very cheap compared to phone prices in the western world, that is still on the upper end of prices in the developing world. At that price point, Apple is still likely to make a profit, too. Thanks to their already massive margins and mature production techniques, they can produce the iPhone 5S for a remarkably low price.

Michael Pascoe Follow on Facebook Follow on Twitter 81 reading now facebook SHARE twitter TWEET email google-plus linkedin reddit More Among many points of difference with his predecessor, the reborn big-taxing, big-spending Scott Morrison last night showed that he's a much better salesman than Joe Hockey. Morrison has got away with rehashing Hockey's infrastructure PR trick – think of a big number and keep adding years until you reach it. That's what ScoMo has done with his headline-grabbing "$75 billion in infrastructure funding and financing" promise. It seems most of the media overlooked the last phrase in the relevant budget speech sentence: "Tonight, we announce we will deliver $75 billion in infrastructure funding and financing over the next ten years." Related Content $75 billion infrastructure spending spree Victoria shortchanged in $75b infrastructure spending spree Wake up, people! Spread over 10 years, the Commonwealth is only offering $7.5 billion a year, much of it already in Hockey's numbers and a fair swag of that dating from Labor government commitments. It's less than what the state of New South Wales invests annually. Smokin' Joe tried hard to promote a "record" infrastructure investment of $50 billion in his first budget with the fine print admitting it was spread over six years. If the Abbott government had kept that promise, it would have averaged $8.3 billion a year, 11 per cent more than Morrison's stretch. Advertisement No, despite the rhetoric and the gullibility of much of the media, there's no evidence of Morrison being converted to the economic mainstream's belief that it's an excellent idea to borrow big now at low rates to invest big in the nation's future with projects that will more than pay for themselves. The reality is that the federal transport infrastructure spend is being held pretty much steady. By announcing or re-announcing a number of commitments, especially three big-ticket items, Morrison has managed to make his spend sound bigger than it actually is. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link The reborn big-taxing, big-spending Scott Morrison has shown he's a much better salesman than his predecessor Joe Hockey. Photo: Bloomberg And the three eye-catching announcements – Badgerys Creek airport, the National Party's marginal inland rail pet project and Snowy 2.0 -  are still a long ways off costing the budget serious money. But that's actually not a bad thing as the infrastructure boom is already taking off without any help from ScoMo. As previously reported, national spending on transport infrastructure is in the process of soaring 73 per cent from a cyclical low last financial year to a peak in 2018-19.  According to industry research company Macromonitor, spending on road and rail hit a low of about $19 billion in 2015-16 but is set to peak at $33 billion in 2018-19. This is the surge that's keeping economic growth from sliding with housing building approvals over the next year or so – and most of it is thanks to the richer state governments. It is at least nice that Morrison is talking the talk, even if he isn't really walking it. But, aside from the gratuitous spinning, there is a worry or two in what the money is being spent on. There's a danger that Morrison is providing an example of "good debt" and "bad debt" that isn't what he intended. The $5.3 billion being invested over many years in Western Sydney Airport looks like "good debt". The $8.4 billion promised for the Melbourne-Brisbane inland rail link could easily end up as bad debt. Infrastructure Australia scored the $10 billion rail line as having a benefit-cost ratio (BCR) of just 1.1 – and that's after including a range of claimed wider economic benefits. It's a marginal score. Under some scenarios, the BCR drops below 1, which is a less than marginal.  Backflips of the budget speech Infrastructure Australia has a list of projects that score much more highly. There's a suggestion that the inland rail corridor is something that maybe should be looked at again in a few years time, but the government is charging ahead for the sake of National Party seats. Of course the National Party sees the figures differently, leaving us with the question of who should be trusted with such large investments – a body somewhat like Infrastructure Australia, or a bunch of politicians with considerable self-interest? And then there's the PM from Snowy River. There's reportedly no actual funding in the 2017-18 budget to build what's needed to pump water uphill as a means of storing energy, yet the initial talk of spending $2 billion on the idea has blown out by several billion more with the idea of buying the NSW and Victorian state government shares. Again, it's a project that requires a de-politicised competitive assessment of pumping water versus the new battery farms. But the politics of it, the Prime Ministerial image, isn't likely to let that happen. Oh well, it did provide one of the more bemusing passing backflips of the budget speech: the feigned passion with which Treasurer Morrison promised that Snowy Hydro would remain government owned. You might think the Liberal Party suddenly has an ideological problem with privatisation. Whatever will the IPA say?

(AAP Video) It heeds mainstream economists' advice and abandons the Coalition's misguided professed concern about a "debt and deficit crisis". It is, however, a lot stronger on principle than practice. Related Content At last they're governing, but ducking hard decisions Live: PM, Treasurer sell their tax, spend and build budget It accepts the repeated urgings of the Reserve Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development that the government distinguish between borrowing for worthwhile infrastructure – which raises the economy's productivity – and continuing to borrow to cover recurrent deficits long after the downturn has passed. It abandons the Coalition's smaller government ideology and accepts economists' advice that all successful attempts to return the budget to surplus involve a combination of spending cuts and tax increases. Advertisement In short, it's a big spending, big taxing, big borrowing budget. Smarties may call it "Labor lite" but, in truth, it contains measures Labor wouldn't have dared to take: increasing the Medicare levy, imposing a much bigger tax on the big banks, and standing up to the Catholics schools' demand to continue their special treatment compared with other private and government schools. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Treasurer Scott Morrison delivers the 2017-18 federal budget. Photo: Dean Lewins Scott Morrison is right to say the budget is a fair and responsible path back to surplus. It better aligns government policy with the voters' wishes, does a better job of managing the economy and puts the budget on a sounder basis – but all without bringing closer the time when Morrison expects the budget to return to surplus. In truth, whether his prediction this will happen in 2020-21 proves accurate turns on economic forces beyond his ability to forecast, let alone control. Without doubt, the budget measure that will do most to increase economic efficiency – not to mention fairness – is the government's belated embrace of needs-based school funding. Getting funding right is the first step towards raising the poor academic performance of the nation's schools and narrowing the achievement gap between students from advantaged and disadvantaged families. David Gonski's new inquiry will guide us in the second step: improving what happens in the classroom. The success of Labor's "Mediscare" at last year's election has prompted the government to abandon its claim that healthcare spending is growing "unsustainably". It is phasing out its freeze on Medicare rebates to doctors and adding expensive drugs to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, while searching out efficiencies to slow the rate at which spending is growing. The budget relies far more on tax increases than spending cuts to offset its higher spending. The main tax increases are a (delayed) 0.5 percentage point increase in the Medicare levy, a big new tax on big banks and crackdowns on the black economy and multinational tax avoiders. Little there for voters to object to, especially as the higher Medicare levy will pay for the widely supported but hugely expensive National Disability Insurance Scheme. All this is marred, however, by a list of bad measures: the Melbourne to Brisbane inland freight railway is a waste of money, the housing affordability package combines minor measures with a counterproductive superannuation saving scheme, the regional growth fund is a National Party pork barrel, it would have been fairer to continue the 2 per cent deficit levy on high income-earners, and the Medicare guarantee fund is an accounting trick. But you can't have everything – especially not from our flawed political system. This budget is much better than we have come to expect. Ross Gittins is the Herald's economics editor.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 10 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Apple announces environmental progress in China Lens Technology has committed to power all of its glass production for Apple with 100 percent renewable energy by the end of 2018, as part of Apple’s industry-leading supply chain clean energy program announced last year. Lens is the first supplier to make a clean energy commitment for all of its Apple production, and will meet its goal through an unprecedented power purchase agreement with local wind projects. Apple is working with suppliers to help transform the environmental landscape in China, and is proud to announce all 14 of its final assembly sites in China are now compliant with UL’s Zero Waste to Landfill validation. The UL standard certifies all of their manufacturing waste is reused, recycled, composted, or, when necessary, converted into energy. Since the program began in January 2015, the sites have diverted more than 140,000 metric tons of waste from landfills. “We want to show the world that you can manufacture responsibly and we’re working alongside our suppliers to help them lower their environmental impact in China,” said Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives. “We congratulate Lens for their bold step, and hope by sharing the lessons we’ve learned in our transition to renewable energy, our suppliers will continue to access clean power projects, moving China closer to its green manufacturing goals.” “Our power purchase agreement is the first of its kind in southern China and we hope it will serve as an example for other companies looking to transition to cleaner, more economical sources of power,” said Lens CEO Zhou Qunfei. “We’re pleased to be the first supplier to commit to covering all of our Apple production with renewable energy, and proud to source from local Hunan wind farms to power our facilities in Changsha.” Lens’ manufacturing with Apple currently includes two facilities in Changsha, Hunan province. Wind energy will cover 100 percent of the energy consumed producing Apple products at Lens facilities by 2018, avoiding nearly 450,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide each year, equivalent to the energy use in 380,000 Chinese homes.

The company updated its privacy policy on its website Tuesday to announce the acquisition, saying “your personal data will be collected, used and disclosed in accordance with the Apple Privacy Policy.” Beddit developed both software and hardware for monitoring sleep patterns. Its latest product, the Beddit 3 Sleep Monitor, features a soft sensor that’s placed under your bed sheets to analyze sleep-related data. It’s $150 and available on Apple’s website. The technology it uses is based upon ballistocardiography (BCG), an unobtrusive, noninvasive technique for measuring the mechanical activity of the heart, lungs and other body functions. It then transmits the data it collects to your iPhone and Apple Watch. There’s no word yet on the terms of the deal, or what Apple plans to do with Beddit’s products and software, but it’s not hard to imagine them integrating the tech into future products. The current Apple Watch does not feature a stock sleep tracking feature.

The iPhone maker’s shares have gained 33 per cent this year and almost 50 per cent since the US election in November. The company represents about 4 per cent of the US$21.7 trillion that makes up the entire S&P 500 index. Apple accounted for as much as 4.9 per cent of the S&P 500 in September 2012 but is a smaller per centage now as the index as a whole has rallied more than 7 per cent this year. “It’s just reflective of how powerful a franchise it is. It may be the most powerful franchise in the country today,” said Rick Meckler, president of LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey, whose firm does not own the stock. “Considering that it has a limited number of products, it has really dominated that market in a way that few companies have, and it’s been able to retain margins despite lots of competitors.” If Apple continues on its growth path, the company will top the US$1 trillion market cap level later this year. Stock buybacks have also bolstered Apple shares, with the company reducing its actual share count by 20.9 per cent and the average diluted shares outstanding by 20.5 per cent over the past four years, according to Standard & Poor’s data. The median price target on Apple is US$160, up from the US$140 median three months ago. Shares closed at US$153.99 yesterday. The closing market cap of US$802.8 billion was larger than the economies of 45 of the 50 US states, topped only by Illinois, Florida, New York, Texas and California. Billionaire Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway has disclosed a stake of roughly US$20 billion in Apple, said on Monday he had grown more fond of the company because he could “very easily determine” the iPhone maker’s competitive position “and who is trying to chase them”. — Reuters                  MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Asian stocks set on edge by Comey dismissal, N.

Having previously announced its return to San Jose's McEnery Convention Center, the company has now confirmed the keynote in the same location, at 10am local time (1pm EST, 6pm BST). Apple traditionally kicks the five-day conference with the keynote address from Tim Cook, his chief lieutenants and a number of important third-party developers, and it seems this year will be no different. Apple is widely-expected to debut new versions of iOS and macOS as well as boosts to its tvOS and watchOS platforms. While WWDC is traditionally a software focused event, there’s a growing expectation Apple will announce its Siri-powered smart speaker. Related: WWDC 2017 - What to expect This year, rather than drop some cryptic hints with graphics and a catchy slogan, Apple opted to make a political statement with this year’s WWDC announcement. In the centre of what appears to be a group of people from multiple backgrounds, the company pens a short monologue about the importance of diversity. “Technology alone is not enough,” it begins. “Technology must intersect with the liberal arts and the humanities to create new ideas and experiences that push society forwards. “This summer we bring together thousands of brilliant minds representing many diverse perspectives, passions, and talents to help us change the world.” The wordy invite could be a pushback against anti-liberalism and anti-globalism sentiment engulfing the political scene in the US and across the world.

This has also been confirmed by Beddit on their website in a post under their privacy policy. The post reads, “Beddit has been acquired by Apple. Your personal data will be collected, used and disclosed in accordance with the Apple Privacy Policy.” For those unfamiliar, Beddit is a company that makes a sleep sensor that can collect sleep data on its user and sends that data to an accompanying app on either the iPhone or the Apple Watch. At the moment it is unclear as to what Apple plans to do with Beddit, although the company’s interest in sleep tracking isn’t exactly surprising. With iOS 10, Apple introduced a more advanced alarm clock that can help to monitor sleeping habits, but with the acquisition of Beddit, it sounds like Apple wants to further those plans. We’re not sure if Beddit’s technology will ultimately end up inside the iPhone, the Apple Watch, or maybe even both, but don’t be surprised if future Apple products were to come with more advanced sleep tracking functionality. In the meantime Beddit’s sleep monitor can still be purchased via Apple’s Online Store for $150. Filed in Apple >General. Read more about Health.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Channel / Foxconn looking to build factory in the US, move closer to Apple Foxconn looking to build factory in the US, move closer to Apple Paul Taylor 8 hours ago Channel Foxconn, the giant electronics manufacturing conglomerate and Apple’s biggest OEM manufacturing partner, has begun talks with the US federal authorities to find a suitable place to set up a sixth-generation TFT-LCD panel factory, according to Digitimes. The display factory would cater to small-to-medium sized 6G panels and could be used in Apple’s iPhone, iPad and MacBooks, it is said. It would also move the busines a lot closer to the source of much of the autonomous driving system R&D going on in the States, which Foxconn could potentially supply with automotive displays. The likelihood of Foxconn investing in a large display panel factory is low, as the company cannot compete under its house brand – Sharp – after it had sold its US license to Chinese HiSense (until 2020). At the moment, it seems, the company is still in talks with Federal and State authorities to find the best location and incentives for its investment, so no hard date has been set. Foxconn, after the Sharp acquisition, and having a considerable stake in several other display companies, can tap into three different types of display technology: IGZO, a-Si and LTPS, which offer each different sets of Pros and Cons. IGZO is set to be a premium type of display, which is expensive to manufacture, while Amorphous Silicon and Polycrystalline Silicon offer much cheaper tooling and manufacturing costs.

Why borrow when sitting on $240 billion in cash? “One five-letter word: taxes,” said Steven Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution’s Tax Policy Center. Apple has $240 billion in cash held overseas, out of total cash reserves of $256.8 billion, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings. So far in 2017, the Cupertino tech giant has issued unsecured notes three times: on May 5 for $7 billion; on Feb. 15 for $1 billion; and on Feb. 3 for $10 billion, according to company filings with the SEC, for a total of $18 billion. The money, in all three cases, would be used for “general corporate purposes, including repurchases of our common stock and payment of dividends under our program to return capital to shareholders, funding for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and repayment of debt,” Apple said in its filings. That borrowing followed $23.9 billion in unsecured debt raised last year. Apple, the world’s most valuable public company with a market capitalization Tuesday at $802.7 billion, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on its borrowing and overseas holdings. The iPhone maker’s overseas cash holdings — which hit $240 billion by April 1, up $26 billion since mid-September — come from the firm’s transfer of intellectual property and profits to its foreign subsidiaries. Bringing the money home would put Apple on the hook for a U.S. federal tax rate of 35 percent. “Apple’s shareholders might get somewhat impatient with this large cash hoard offshore,” Rosenthal said. “Apple shareholders might want to see some dividends or some of their stock redeemed.” Indeed, Apple on May 2 announced it was expanding its capital return program for shareholders, and would spend $300 billion on it by the end of March 2019. “We generated strong operating cash flow of $12.5 billion and returned over $10 billion to our investors in the March quarter,” Apple’s chief financial officer Luca Maestri said in a news release. Apple’s foreign reserves help it borrow money unsecured, Rosenthal said. “The overseas cash signals to the marketplace that Apple has resources if need be,” he said. Apple’s borrowing this year carries interest rates of 1.6 to 4.3 percent, a fraction of the cost of repatriating hoarded funds. Apple appears to be waiting on a one-time tax holiday widely expected from Congress, which would let companies bring overseas money home at a far lower rate than 35 percent, Rosenthal said. “They’re betting that they’ll get tax relief in the near term, and rather than incur the expense of repatriating their offshore earnings, they’d like to defer and hope for another holiday,” he said. He views such holidays, the last of which occurred in 2004 with a special 5.25 percent repatriation tax, as “a pretty bad policy.” After the last holiday, companies brought home money, but immediately began stockpiling cash overseas again as the low rate was intended to be a one-time event, Rosenthal said. Apple could be expected to do the same thing in the wake of another holiday, he said. “They’ll continue this game until they get another holiday, and unless we change the tax structure, they’ll start building (foreign reserves) up again.”   Tags:  60 Second Biz Break Apple Taxes Technology Ethan Baron Ethan Baron is a business reporter at The Mercury News, and a native of Silicon Valley before it was Silicon Valley.

Could Anybody Be Worse Than James Comey On Encryption? We're About to Find Out A look back at former FBI Director James Comey’s years-long battle against privacy. President Donald Trump fired FBI Director James Comey on Tuesday evening. While Comey's full legacy remains to be seen, we know one thing for sure: He was the most outspoken enemy of public access to strong encryption in the United States intelligence community. Comey's stance on encryption was that it allowed bad guys to "go dark"—making it impossible for law enforcement to access their data during investigations. This isn't rare in the intelligence community, and aligns closely with Trump's limited public discussion of the issue (Trump suggested Americans boycott Apple for not helping the FBI break into an iPhone belonging to the terrorist who committed the San Bernardino attack in 2014). We don't yet know who will replace Comey, and whoever does will likely also want the ability for the FBI and other intelligence agencies to obtain as much information as possible for its investigations. But Comey spoke often and repeatedly about his disdain for tech companies who protect the privacy of their users by using strong encryption. At Congressional hearings, think tank panels, and in public speeches, he noted his disdain for end-to-end messaging encryption—which cannot be intercepted and decrypted while messages are in transit—and for the default encryption of data on iPhone and Android phones. This is important because it protects phones from being easily hacked and people's information from being stolen. Comey tried numerous tactics to get tech companies and Congress to make law enforcement access to encrypted data easier. His go-to argument was that tech companies weren't "trying hard enough" to design new types of encryption that could be accessed by law enforcement but not by, say, hackers or foreign governments. He repeatedly said that law enforcement wanted a "front door" or a "golden key" to access data with a warrant, but ignored the many computer scientists and cryptographers who explained that, by definition, any vulnerability built into encryption could potentially be exploited by hackers. Comey's steady, unrelenting drumbeat against encryption began in earnest in October 2014, soon after Apple and Google announced that their mobile operating systems would be encrypted by default. In a speech at the Brookings think tank, Comey set up his position by explaining that encryption is used by "predators" and "bad guys." "With Going Dark, those of us in law enforcement and public safety have a major fear of missing out—missing out on predators who exploit the most vulnerable among us … kids call this FOMO," he said. "If the challenges of real-time interception threaten to leave us in the dark, encryption threatens to lead all of us to a very dark place." In that speech, he also noted that "Congress might have to force" companies like Apple and Google to undermine their encryption. Read More: Carnegie Mellon Helped the Government Access a Terror-Linked iPhone, Source Says In March 2015, the FBI removed a recommendation that consumers encrypt their devices. In May, Facebook, Google, Apple, and Microsoft wrote a letter to to Barack Obama asking him to not seek encryption backdoors that would harm the privacy of their customers. Comey called the letter "depressing" and said that there are "societal costs to universal encryption." By July, Comey was blaming encryption for the unfettered and untappable exchange of information within ISIS: "They don't need to find propaganda, it's buzzing in their pocket. There is a device, a devil on their shoulder all day long saying kill kill kill kill," he said. "We can see them give directions [on Twitter sending them] to end-to-end encrypted app and they give them instructions." At a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in December, Comey said that breaking encryption was "not a technical issue, it's a business model question." "The question we have to ask is: should they change their business model?," he said. All of this rhetoric came to a head in early 2016, when Comey had a specific case to point to: The FBI couldn't access the encrypted iPhone of the alleged San Bernardino shooter. The FBI and Comey pushed Apple to build a backdoor into its encryption and then to protect that backdoor from getting into the wild. Apple refused, citing the very real danger this would pose to iPhone customers (potentially allowing hackers or other non-US agencies to access people's phones), and eventually the FBI turned to other means to crack the phone. With the election taking up most of the second half of 2016, Comey didn't speak about encryption much. But his anti-encryption talk resurfaced just last week, when Comey suggested that a law against encryption might be possible under Trump. Again, we don't know who will replace Comey. In an interview with Walter Isaacson in October, Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe at least sounded pragmatic, noting that many encrypted messaging services operate overseas where the FBI has no jurisdiction. That, at least, is a fact that Comey rarely addressed.

(Photo: Win McNamee, Getty Images) CONNECTTWEET 56 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE In a letter Friday, FBI Director James Comey revealed a new review of recently-discovered emails related to the FBI's previously-closed investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private server. In this, profile from June, Kevin Johnson detailed how Comey has performed in this role. WASHINGTON — When President Obama named James Comey to succeed FBI Director Robert Mueller, the popular nominee acknowledged the long shadow cast by the man who in the previous 12 years had led the bureau longer than anyone except J. Edgar Hoover. “I must be out of my mind to be following Bob Mueller,’’ Comey said in the 2013 White House Rose Garden ceremony. "I don't know if I can fill those shoes, but I know that, however I do, I will be standing truly on the shoulders of a giant." Indeed, Mueller’s tenure was widely credited with the post-9/11 transformation of the FBI from a largely reactive law enforcement institution to an intelligence-driven agency bent on preventing new terror strikes. And he did it by shunning the spotlight at virtually every opportunity. By contrast, Comey, 55,  has staked out a public profile that couldn’t be more different than his predecessor and the traditional confines of the office itself. He has bluntly acknowledged law enforcement’s fraught relationship with racial and ethnic communities in addresses at Georgetown University and Birmingham, Ala.,and has suggested that less-aggressive policing may be contributing to troubling spikes in violent crime in some parts of the country — a position that has put him at odds with his boss, Attorney General Loretta Lynch, and even the White House. He has drawn the wrath of the tech industry and privacy advocates earlier this year as the face of the government's legal battle with Apple Inc. to gain access to the iPhone of San Bernardino terrorist Syed Farook. The high-stakes dispute represented what Comey described as the  “hardest problem I’ve encountered in my entire government career.’’ And he has publicly faced new questions about the bureau's capacity to confront an increasingly daunting challenge: thwarting violent extremists from within who are drawing inspiration from a constellation of radical ideologies to commit mass murder.  At one point during a briefing last week on the Orlando massacre, carried out by a gunman who was twice before on the FBI's radar, Comey acknowledged the vexing nature of the mounting burden, ticking off a list of recent bloody assaults and attempted attacks that have scarred Garland, Texas, Charleston, S.C., Chattanooga, Tenn., San Bernardino, Calif. and now Orlando. "We are looking for needles in a nation-wide haystack,'' Comey said, "and we are also called upon to figure out which pieces of hay may some day become needles.'' USA TODAY FBI director: 'Viral videos' may have chilling effect on cops Not in more than 20 years, say former national security officials, criminal justice analysts and bureau critics, has the bully pulpit of the FBI director been used to address such an array of hot-button issues and with such frequency. "I've known Jim for a quarter century,'' said Chuck Rosenberg, director of the Drug Enforcement Administration who also served as Comey's first chief of staff at the FBI. "When he feels like he has something to say, he does so only after careful judgment. And while it may seem like an unusual role for an FBI director, it's not a reflex action. It has nothing to do with self promotion or aggrandizement.''  (Photo: Sean Logan, The Montgomery (Ala.) /Advertiser) Michael Chertoff, a former Homeland Security secretary during the George W. Bush administration, said the stark difference in "personal style'' that Comey has brought to the office plays to the strengths of someone "well positioned ... to address issues in the forefront of public discussion.'' "Bob Mueller was very quiet; he didn't deal with things publicly,'' Chertoff said, adding that the post-9/11 environment required Mueller to focus his efforts inward to deal with the new terror threat. "I think it's really appropriate (for Comey to speak out). It reflects his independence.'' USA TODAY FBI director reflects on Apple dispute USA TODAY FBI director: No 'external deadline' for finishing Clinton email probe Defending the Bureau A year ago, when the tragic details came to light about a law enforcement breakdown that allowed Dylann Roof to purchase the gun he allegedly used to murder nine people at the iconic Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, S.C., it was Comey who delivered the "heartbreaking'' news. "We are all sick that this has happened,'' a grim-faced director said of the background check system's failure to seize on the contents of an arrest record that would have barred Roof from obtaining the .45-caliber handgun just two months before the shooting. "We wish we could turn back time, because from this vantage point everything seems obvious. But we can't.'' And in the immediate aftermath of the Orlando massacre, it was Comey who provided the unsettling history of the bureau's contacts with gunman Omar Mateen, beginning three years prior to the massacre. Though the director pledged a review of those contacts, which included a 10-month investigation of Mateen's possible terror links, he defended his agency's decision to close that inquiry in 2014 without action and to conclude months later that the 29-year-old security guard had no substantive association with American-born suicide bomber Moner Muhammad Abu Salha. The Vero Beach, Fla., man died in a 2014 attack in Syria. "We will work all day and all night to understand (Mateen's) path to that terrible night,'' Comey said. "We're also going to look hard at our own work to see if there is something we should have done differently. So far, the honest answer is, I don't think so.'' Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, is among those who have called for a closer examination of the FBI's dealings with Mateen and whether the bureau has the resources to keep pace with "an increasing threat.'' Both issues are expected to be the focus of a hearing next month where Comey and Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson are expected to testify. "I think they are overwhelmed,'' McCaul said, referring to the FBI's load of about 1,000 active investigations involving suspected violent extremists, most inspired by ISIL. "It's quite a challenge for federal law enforcement.'' Despite those serious concerns, McCaul has no issue with the bureau's management. "He's really been a leader,'' the chairman said, referring to Comey's public statements on race, encryption and the threat of domestic radicalization. "I'm telling you, he has broad support in Congress.'' Frank assessments not universally embraced For the 6-foot-8-inch, self-described “awkward white guy,’’ a public address on race was not at once a comfortable fit. During a recent Birmingham speech — at the 16th Street Baptist Church, sacred ground in the American civil rights movement — Comey acknowledged the unusual anxiety he had encountered as he prepared to address the fractured relationship between law enforcement and minority communities during an appearance at Georgetown University in February. "I had struggled for months to figure out whether or not I had something useful to say, and I worried a whole lot how I would be received," Comey told the gathering of civil rights advocates and law enforcement officials assembled at the Birmingham church. Even Justice officials questioned whether the FBI director was the appropriate figure to raise such issues when Comey's office provided a courtesy copy of the Georgetown address before the February appearance, two officials familiar with the matter said. The two officials, who are not authorized to comment publicly, said the director went forward with the speech, despite those reservations. USA TODAY FBI director confronts race, law enforcement Comey said the desire to speak publicly, following the tumult in Ferguson, Staten Island and Baltimore, was ultimately spurred by the outpouring of "pain'' he encountered at the January 2015 funeral of New York Police Department officer Wenjian Liu. The officer was one of two assassinated by a gunman apparently driven to avenge the deaths of black suspects Michael Brown and Eric Garner by police in Ferguson and Staten Island. "As I talked to people that day,'' Comey said in Birmingham, referring to the Liu funeral, "I thought, you know, maybe I can contribute something. Maybe if I say things I believe to be true about people, things I believe to be true about law enforcement, maybe I could foster a more open-minded discussion about where we are, who we are and what we need to be.''  (Photo: Jewel Samad, AFP/Getty Images) At both Georgetown and in Birmingham, Comey acknowledged law enforcement's legacy of distrust in racial and ethnic communities. "Police officers often work in environments where a disproportionate percentage of street crime is committed by young men of color,'' Comey said in Birmingham. "And on an overnight shift, sometimes all an officer sees is trouble. Something can happen to people of goodwill in that environment.'' Comey's remarks prompted powerful, yet disparate responses within the law enforcement community — from the street ranks to the executive suites. Birmingham Police Chief A.C. Roper, who recalled his own department's checkered history, said the the city's iconic church — where four African-American girls were murdered in a Ku Klux Klan bombing more than 50 years ago — represented "the perfect backdrop'' for the director's remarks last month. "It's an unfortunate reality, but the Birmingham Police Department, which I now have the honor of leading, was the arms and legs of a brutal racist municipal government,'' Roper said. "Although as an agency we continue to change, the complex dynamics of race and law enforcement is playing out across the nation.'' Attorney General Loretta Lynch walks with Sixteenth Street Baptist Church Rev. Arthur Price Jr., center, and Birmingham Police Chief A. C. Roper, after touring the historic civil rights church on June 24, 2015.  (Photo: Hal Yeager, AP) But Jim Pasco, executive director of the nation's largest police union, the Fraternal Order of Police, said Comey's words have amounted to an affront to most officers. "The first thing a police officer learns is that you cannot generalize,'' Pasco said. "Director Comey has demonstrated that he is a very glib generalizer. If he's trying to be provocative, he is succeeding; if he's trying to be instructive I'm not so sure. The shame of it is, he's personally very charming. He's the kind of guy you want to like, but he's making it very hard to do so.'' Comey also has ruffled some with a repeated suggestion that a pull back by police, stung by streaming videos of violent public encounters, is contributing to surges in violent crime in a number of cities across the country. "I was worried about it last fall,'' Comey told reporters last month, echoing a similar assessment he offered during appearances the previous year in Chicago. "And I am, in many ways, more worried now." A day later, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said the administration response to such crime trends would be “based on evidence, not anecdotes.” Yet New York Police Commissioner William Bratton said the FBI director should be free to speak his mind, regardless of the uncomfortable political implications. "He's a breath of fresh air,'' Bratton said. "The system is working the way it was intended.'' That a New York police commissioner is even publicly expressing such regard for an FBI director represents a fairly recent breakthrough of its own. For years, the relationship between the two agencies was fractured by turf wars and mutual suspicion. Clash sparks national debate Perhaps no other public battle has thrust Comey into the spotlight more than the government's legal pursuit of Apple. In attempting to force the tech giant to assist federal investigators in unlocking an iPhone used by Farook, the San Bernardino terrorist, the FBI director set off an emotional national debate. In a series of court filings over a period of weeks, the government and Apple engaged in a war of words while Comey took his argument to the court of public opinion. USA TODAY FBI not trying to send message or set precedent with Apple case, Comey says “If we’re going to get to a world where there are spaces in American life that are immune from judicial search warrants, then that is a very different world from the one in which we live,’’ Comey told a House panel in February. "Corporations shouldn’t drive us there; the FBI shouldn’t make that decision. The American people should decide how we want to be governed.’’  (Photo: Jim Lo Scalzo, EPA) The debate was put on hold when an unidentified FBI contractor successfully hacked into the seized device, negating the government's need for Apple's help. But likely not for long. Some civil liberties advocates assert that the FBI director's very public role in the Apple dispute — coming less than halfway through Comey's 10-year appointment — represents a long-term threat that stretches far beyond the San Bernardino terror case. "Director Comey has really taken a leadership role in trying to push Congress to take on encryption,'' said Neema Singh Guliani, a legislative counsel with the ACLU. "San Bernardino was really an attempt at setting precedent (to gain access to private communications). And the reaction from the general public was clear: this was not good for the country.'' USA TODAY FBI paid at least $1.3M to hack terrorist iPhone Comey, who has committed to serving his full 10-year term, has said setting precedent was never the goal. Nobody should be really surprised by the director's outspoken style, if only for his extraordinary appearance nine years ago before a Senate panel in which Comey detailed a 2004 showdown with top George W. Bush administration officials in the hospital room of the seriously ill then-Attorney General John Ashcroft.  (Photo: Susan Walsh, AP) At Ashcroft's beside at George Washington Hospital, then-White House counsel Alberto Gonzales and chief of staff Andrew Card sought to persuade Ashcroft to reauthorize the controversial warrantless eavesdropping program. Comey, then deputy attorney general, learned of the meeting and rushed to Ashcroft's hospital room, along with Mueller, the FBI director. When both Comey and Mueller threatened to resign, the White House relented. The New York Times first reported the incident in 2006, but Comey's vivid recitation offered an instant classic of Washington political theater that resonated nearly a decade later as an example of his independence when he was nominated to take over the FBI. The quality has not gone unnoticed inside the bureau and among the loyal FBI alumni whom the director has actively courted since his confirmation. Reynaldo Tariche, president of the FBI Agents Association, said Comey's "straight talking'' way has resonated with street agents. Although the association initially urged the nomination of former Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich, a former agent, to succeed Mueller, Tariche said Comey has so far proved to be "powerful spokesman for the bureau.'' "He has an ability to talk about the tough subjects that not only affect that FBI, but law enforcement in general,'' said Nancy Savage, executive director of the Society of Former Special Agents of the FBI. "While he's not out there seeking public approval, he is well-liked. He's very candid with people. He wants them committed to their jobs, but he also wants them to go home to their families at the end of the day.'' Current and former colleagues say Comey, the father of five, also attempts to find the same life balance, usually beginning the workday at  7 a.m., and leaving the office by 6:30 p.m. And there are occasions when meetings are missed because of family obligations, as simple as ensuring that a daughter catches a ride to a school function. During an April talk to Catholic University law students, he offered an unusually personal window into a management philosophy not often espoused in a city fueled by unvarnished ambition. “I expect you will sleep,’’ Comey said, recounting recent advice to FBI agents. “And I want you to love somebody.’’ CONNECTTWEET 56 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1W7EQOO

For those wondering, we are getting close as Apple has since started to send out media invites to the event which will be taking place on the 5th of June and will run until the 9th of June. As to what will be announced, it is safe to assume that we will probably be hearing more about what Apple has planned for the future of iOS and macOS. We had previously heard that Apple could introduce its own version of Workflow for both iOS and macOS and that’s something to look forward to. Presumably there could also be updates on watchOS and tvOS, but we haven’t really heard much on that front yet. As for potential hardware launches, there was a wild rumor earlier this month that suggested that Apple could unveil its next iPhone at the event. While we’re not privy to Apple’s decisions, based on previous releases and reports from reputable sources, that does seem to be a bit unlikely, so don’t get your hopes up just yet. However we have heard that Apple could be launching its own Amazon Echo/Google Home competitor so that could be interesting, but either way do check back with us next month if you’d like the official details.

Roston - May 9, 2017 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Apple has acquired Beddit, the company behind a sleep tracking gadget and related mobile app. The announcement was made via Beddit’s privacy page on its website, which reads, “Beddit has been acquired by Apple.” On the consumer end of things, this means users’ personal data will be collected and used under the conditions set forth in the Apple Privacy Policy. Apple hasn’t commented on the acquisition, however, and how much it paid remains unknown. Beddit, for those unfamiliar, is a sleep monitoring device in the form of a long flat sensor. This device slips underneath a bed’s sheets and plugs into a wall outlet using USB. The device is not noticeable to the person sleeping, as it measures a mere 1.5mm thick, which is about 0.06-inches. Beddit then tracks things about a person’s sleep; it can keep tabs on up to two people. The related mobile app presents a variety of information about the night’s sleep, such as a summary of it including things like ‘efficiency’ and heart rate. The app also presents a tab with sleep trends using multiple nights’ data. There’s a smart alarm for being awoken at the best time, and even the option for linking in your daytime activities to see how they affect the quality of sleep at night. The Beddit 3 Sleep Monitor is being sold directly through Apple.com for $149.95 USD. As the new Beddit privacy page states, health information collected by the Beddit system can be shared with Apple’s Health app. Any larger plans Apple may have for Beddit aren’t clear at this time.

Tech giant Apple could probably acquire any company it wants right now, since the company is currently sitting on a huge cash hoard of $250 billion that's just waiting to be spent. Reuters reports that Citigroup analyst Jim Suva has listed Tesla as a possible takeover target for Apple, along with several other media and video games companies including Netflix, Hulu, Electronic Arts, Activision Blizzard, Take Two Interactive Software, and Walt Disney. Currently, over 90 percent of Tesla’s cash is overseas, but new proposals by President Trump could bring overseas profit into the US at a 10 percent tax rate as opposed to the current 35 percent rate. With this new proposal, Apple could bring a whopping $220 billion into the US for a potential takeover. Since one of the new administration's top priorities is to allow US companies to repatriate overseas cash at a lower tax rate, Apple may have a more acute need to put this cash to use," said Suva. You can certainly see why Apple could potentially be interested taking over Tesla, since both companies are keen to bring fully autonomous driving to the masses. Tesla aims to offer Level 5 autonomy in 2019, while Apple is allegedly working with Bosch on self-driving technology and was recently granted permission to test the technology in California. Previously, Apple was thought to be working on its own autonomous car under the name of Project Titan, before shifting its focus to connectivity and self-driving technology that other automakers could utilize. Apple joining forces with Tesla would also make sense, since Tesla is more established in the auto industry - going head-to-head with one of the pioneers of electric cars is always going to be risky. Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk recently downplayed the suggestion during a recent conference call, however. “Yeah, I don’t think they want to have that conversation,” he replied when asked about a potential Apple takeover by Morgan Stanley analyst Adan Jonas, as reported by BGR. “At least I’ve not heard any indication that they do. Obviously Apple continues to make some great products and, yeah, I mean, I use their phone and their laptop, it’s cool. I mean… I don’t know what else to say.” As it stands, Tesla’s market cap is currently just over $50 billion, but Musk believes he can overtake Apple’s $700 billion market cap within the next decade, so it seems unlikely that he will want to hand over control of the company.

 (Updates to close)
    By Noel RandewichMay 9 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 fell on Tuesday after edging
up to an intra-day record high for the second straight session,
while Apple became the first U.S. company to close with a market
capitalization above $800 billion.
    Better-than-expected quarterly earnings from U.S. companies
  and Emmanuel Macron's victory in the French presidential
election on Sunday have given investors confidence, but
valuations for U.s. stocks are already higher than average.
    The hope that U.S. President Donald Trump will cut corporate
and personal taxes remained in focus for investors.
    "Earnings are improving and the potential for tax reform
plays a big role. Why would you want to sell stocks here when
you might get a tax break later on?" said Bruce Bittles, chief
investment strategist for Robert W. Baird & Co.Apple rose 0.64 percent to end at $153.99, giving it a
market valuation of $802.9 billion, a first for a U.S. company.
Investors are optimistic the Cupertino, California company will
mark the 10th anniversary of the iPhone by launching a model
with suped-up features.
    "It's a real testament to what they've accomplished," said
Rick Meckler, president of investment firm LibertyView Capital
Management in Jersey City, New Jersey. However, he said Apple's
massive size could hamper it's ability to keep growing.
    The Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> declined 0.17
percent to end at 20,975.78 points and the S&P 500 <.SPX> lost
0.10 percent to 2,396.92 points.
    The Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 0.29 percent to close at
a record high of 6,120.59, helped by Apple.
    After the bell, videogame maker Electronic Arts jumped 3.9
percent following its fiscal fourth-quarter report. [nL4N1IB5O0]
    Four of the 11 major S&P sectors rose during Tuesday's
session, led by consumer discretionary <.SPLRCD>, while the
typically defensive plays such as utilities <.SPLRCU> and
telecom services <.SPLRCL> fell.
    Energy <.SPNY> dropped 0.86 percent on the back of falling
oil prices.
    Shares of Valeant Pharmaceuticals <VRX.N> jumped 24 percent
after the company posted its first profit in six quarters.
[nL4N1IB3YX]
    Sturm Ruger & Company <RGR.N> jumped 9.85 percent, leading
other gun makers higher after its quarterly report suggested a
drop in demand after Trump's election may be bottoming out.
[nL1N1IB118]
    Endo International <ENDP.O>, Office Depot <ODP.O> and
Marriott <MAR.O> also rose after reporting better-than-expected
quarterly earnings. [nL4N1IA5QP]
    Wayfair <W.N> surged 20.73 percent to an all-time high after
the online furniture retailer revenue beat analysts'
expectations.
    Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a
1.31-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.02-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
    The S&P 500 posted 42 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the
Nasdaq Composite recorded 120 new highs and 59 new lows.
    About 6.7 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, in
line with the daily average over the last 20 sessions.

The terms of the deal have not yet been disclosed. Christina Farr | @chrissyfarr 9 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES Source: Beddit Apple has acquired an app and sleep monitoring device called Beddit. Beddit has updated the privacy policy on its website to state that it has been acquired, although the terms of the deal are not yet clear. The previous page that linked to Beddit's Apple Watch applications appears to have been taken down. Beddit has retained a customer support contact on its website, suggesting that the customer experience will not change. "Your personal data will be collected, used and disclosed in accordance with the Apple Privacy Policy," the updated policy reads. The app makers also state that related data that it collects, like heart rate and respiratory data, can be shared with Apple's health app. Sleep-tracking is an intriguing potential health application for the Apple Watch, as it explores new use-cases in the health and wellness market. An estimated 50 to 70 million US adults have sleep or wakefulness disorders, according to the CDC. The company brought on sleep researcher Rob Raymann to its health team more than three years ago, according to LinkedIn.

Better-than-expected quarterly earnings from U.S. companies and Emmanuel Macron’s victory in the French presidential election on Sunday have given investors confidence, but valuations for U.s. stocks are already higher than average. The hope that U.S. President Donald Trump will cut corporate and personal taxes remained in focus for investors. “Earnings are improving and the potential for tax reform plays a big role. Why would you want to sell stocks here when you might get a tax break later on?” said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist for Robert W. Baird & Co. Apple rose 0.64 percent to end at $153.99, giving it a market valuation of $802.9 billion, a first for a U.S. company. Investors are optimistic the Cupertino, California company will mark the 10th anniversary of the iPhone by launching a model with suped-up features. “It’s a real testament to what they’ve accomplished,” said Rick Meckler, president of investment firm LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey. However, he said Apple’s massive size could hamper it’s ability to keep growing. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI declined 0.17 percent to end at 20,975.78 points and the S&P 500 .SPX lost 0.10 percent to 2,396.92 points. The Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 0.29 percent to close at a record high of 6,120.59, helped by Apple. After the bell, videogame maker Electronic Arts jumped 3.9 percent following its fiscal fourth-quarter report. Four of the 11 major S&P sectors rose during Tuesday’s session, led by consumer discretionary .SPLRCD, while the typically defensive plays such as utilities .SPLRCU and telecom services .SPLRCL fell. Energy .SPNY dropped 0.86 percent on the back of falling oil prices. Shares of Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX.N) jumped 24 percent after the company posted its first profit in six quarters. Sturm Ruger & Company (RGR.N) jumped 9.85 percent, leading other gun makers higher after its quarterly report suggested a drop in demand after Trump’s election may be bottoming out. Endo International (ENDP.O), Office Depot (ODP.O) and Marriott (MAR.O) also rose after reporting better-than-expected quarterly earnings. Wayfair (W.N) surged 20.73 percent to an all-time high after the online furniture retailer revenue beat analysts’ expectations. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.31-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.02-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 42 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 120 new highs and 59 new lows. About 6.7 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, in line with the daily average over the last 20 sessions.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 9 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman UPDATE – Ten Companies Lead in Responding to Radical Market Change and Reinventing Themselves for a Different Future, According to New Analysis of Public Company Data /EINPresswire.com/ — LEXINGTON, MA–(Marketwired – May 9, 2017) – As the pace of change accelerates in virtually every industry, a new study has identified the 10 global companies that have done the best job of remaking their businesses. The list — which includes celebrated tech innovators like Amazon and Netflix as well as standouts from industries that don’t as frequently make innovation headlines, including health care company DaVita and food and beverage giant Danone — offers insights into how market leaders can sustain growth even as disruption threatens their historically successful core business. The Transformation 10, a new report by growth strategy consulting firm Innosight, analyzed 1,000 companies and engaged a panel of business leaders to identify the 10 companies whose transformations had the biggest impact on their respective industries and the most potential to be sustained. The judges included former P&G CEO A.G. Lafley, former Boeing Defense CEO Chris Chadwick, and Columbia business professor Rita Gunther McGrath. Online retailer Amazon and entertainment firm Netflix were tied atop the rankings, followed (in order) by travel-technology company Priceline; global tech firm Apple; health insurer Aetna; software company Adobe; health care firm DaVita; computer and software maker Microsoft; food and beverage company Danone; and steel maker ThyssenKrupp. „A company survives and thrives over time based not on its size at any given time, but on its ability to adapt to disruption and to reposition itself to create a new future. We believe that by identifying companies that are transforming successfully, we can gain a better understanding of the dynamics and success factors of transformation,” notes Innosight managing partner Scott Anthony, who is the co-author of the just-released Dual Transformation: How to Reposition Today’s Business While Creating the Future (Harvard Business Review Press). Each company in the Transformation 10 found a way to create new growth while repositioning its traditional business: 1. Online retail giant Amazon developed technology to streamline internal operations, then turned it into a cloud computing platform that Amazon began selling to outside customers as large as the U.S. government. Since beginning what is now Amazon Web Services (AWS) in 2006, the new growth area now delivers about 10% of revenue, and accounted for more than half of Amazon’s operating profit in 2015. At the same time, Amazon has steadily fortified its core online retail business with new categories, including a growing library of music, movies and original programming. 2. Video entertainment company Netflix began shifting its business model to include on-demand streaming as well as traditional hard-copy DVD rentals in 2007. That core business of hard-copy rentals continues to exist, albeit in a diminished state. Meanwhile, Netflix’s domestic and international streaming business posted almost 90% of the firm’s revenue in 2015, and the company has been producing and commissioning its own content since 2013, another potential source of growth. 3. Travel-technology company Priceline was already the world leader in online travel in 2010, when it decided to provide a more complete service that included the „long tail” of travel suppliers beyond the major hotels (e.g., independent hotels, apartment buildings). To capture that new growth, Priceline acquired companies like Bookings.com and KAYAK, and the new growth business generated about 25% of revenue in 2015. Simultaneously, Priceline recalibrated its core business around helping customers plan a complete travel experience — much like an online concierge. 4. Beginning in 2007, computer giant Apple moved beyond its successful computer hardware business to create the world’s biggest ecosystem for digital content — and then to build on that ecosystem with new devices like the iPhone. Apple continues to be a manufacturer of computers, but the revenue from the firm’s digital networks and related products now accounts for 80% of the company. 5. Health insurer Aetna’s traditional model of selling health insurance through employers has grown nearly 80% over the last four years. Starting in 2010, the firm also began selling care management directly to consumers, and health care IT services to providers. Revenue from these newer, „value-based” contracts now accounts for about 40% of overall firm revenue. 6. Software company Adobe dominated the market for creating and designing documents and images, thanks to brands like Photoshop, Illustrator and Acrobat. But by 2008, fearing a saturated user base and a shift to cloud-based business models, the firm announced a new focus on digital marketing and analytics through a software as a service (SaaS) business model. The core business of packaged creative software lives on as the Creative Cloud subscription service, and new growth through digital marketing now creates almost half (45%) of overall revenue. 7. Health care firm DaVita specialized in kidney dialysis, making its money on a traditional fee-for-service business model and becoming one of the largest operators in its field. But starting in 2012, DaVita began building an „integrated delivery network” to deliver dialysis care as well as manage patients’ total healthcare. The core business — dialysis care — has nearly doubled over the last 10 years, while new growth now delivers 30% of total revenue. 8. Computer firm Microsoft continues to sell hardware and software; its legacy business offering still accounts for about half the company. But, starting in 2010, the firm made a bet on embracing cloud-based technology — while building up its hardware business. Its Intelligent Cloud business, which includes Azure and on-premises server software, reported 2016 revenue of more than $25 billion, almost a third (32%) of the company total. 9. French food and beverage firm Danone moved beyond its traditional yogurt business to grow a portfolio of health brands, including baby foods and other early life nutrition products. Those newer brands now generate 29% of Danone’s revenue, up from just 3% in 2006. At the same time, a slimmed-down core business, refocused on healthy yogurts and other nutritional foods, is still profitable and accounts for the majority of the business. 10. German steel maker ThyssenKrupp, under pressure from low-cost producers in Asia, decided to move drastically away from making and selling steel. Instead, in 2012 the firm began investing in industrial solutions, providing capital equipment, software and services to manufacturers, including refineries and automakers. The new growth area already accounts for 47% of total company revenue. The Transformation 10 report highlights a few takeaways and lessons that can help business leaders respond to market disruption and position their companies for the future, including: Transformational CEOs tend to be „insider outsiders.” Typically it’s not a complete outsider who instigates the change, but a leader who worked at the edges of the organization or in a parallel part of the industry. Transformation involves two separate journeys. The most effective transformation efforts are not monolithic but take a two-pronged approach: repositioning the core business while creating the future growth business. Transformation can only take root if you are constantly telling a story about the future. To transform a company, the CEO must also act as the „storyteller in chief.” That means telling different aspects of the same transformation narrative to all the constituencies and stakeholders in and of the company. Develop a roadmap for transformation before disruption takes hold. By the time the need to transform is clear, it is often too late. Leaders need to stay ahead of new technologies and competitors that can derail their business and act before fault lines are entirely clear. ABOUT THE TRANSFORMATION 10 RESEARCH The research focused on 57 companies from the S&P 500 and Global 500 that had made significant public commitments to transformation. The analysis evaluated public companies through three lenses: new growth, success in repositioning the core, and select financial metrics.  To assess areas of new growth, Innosight measured how successful these companies have been at creating new products, services, markets and business models, and in that process determined the percent of revenue that can be attributed to new growth areas. To measure success in repositioning the core business, Innosight examined how effectively these companies adapted their traditional businesses to changes or disruptions in their markets. The financial metrics that Innosight analyzed combined annual growth rate (CAGR) of each company’s revenue and stock price, as well as overall profitability, during their respective transformation periods. After narrowing down to a list of 18 companies, Innosight worked with a panel of business leaders to identify the 10 companies whose transformations had the biggest impact on their respective industries and the most potential to be sustained. The judges were: Chris Chadwick, former CEO, Boeing Defense; Clay Christensen, Professor, Harvard Business School and Innosight co-founder; Scott Cook, Founder and Chairman of Intuit; Matthew Eyring, Chief Strategy and Innovation Officer at Vivint; A.G. Lafley, former CEO of Procter & Gamble; Rita McGrath, Professor, Columbia Business School; Teo Ming Kian, Director Temasek and Chairman Vertex Holdings; Theodor Weimer, Country Chairman, UniCredit.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 9 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Vidih Introduces Easy, Powerful iOS Screen Recording and Live Streaming Without Breaking Apple Rules NEW YORK(5/9/2017) – Screen recording has long been a wish-list item for iOS device users, but because Apple doesn’t allow screen recorders on the App Store, the technology has remained unavailable–until today’s release of Vidih, the new service that empowers iPod, iPad and iPhone users to record and live stream anything on their device to Twitch, YouTube and Facebook Live, complete with microphone audio for easy, real-time narration. Best of all, Vidih was developed to work within Apple’s strict requirements, so users never break a single iOS rule by using Vidih. „Live streaming apps or any other on-screen content to social media from any iOS mobile device just became simple,” said Dieter Smith, a member of the Vidih team. „Apple’s closed system presents some technical challenges for developers, especially when it comes to screen recording. Today, we’re proud to say we’ve overcome those challenges and are now offering a first-of-its-kind tool for recording and live streaming anything on a user’s screen without breaking Apple’s rules.” Before today’s release of the tool, users had few options for live streaming apps directly from their iOS devices. A jailbroken device was required, and even then, the few apps that were available tended to be resource-intensive and unreliable. Vidih, on the other hand, is initiated from the web browser on the user’s mobile device and the resource intensive work is done by one of Vidih’s many servers instead of by an onboard app —making Vidih a versatile, fast and convenient solution that never requires users to break rules (or potentially void warranties) by jailbreaking their devices and works on even the slowest of iOS devices. Unikel Global does have an optional paid app in the App Store with video editing tools and access to a premium account with unlimited live streaming and recording time. However, anyone can take advantage of the core features of Vidih from his or her iOS device, and Vidih is always accessed from https://vidih.com/ rather than from the optional app. Social media viewers will appreciate Vidih’s high resolution and frame rate, which, at up to 1080p and 60 fps, respectively, are comparable to the highest-end video games. The tool records and live streams high-fidelity sound directly from the device and can even capture microphone audio, so users can narrate whatever they’re seeing and doing on their screens in real time. Because Vidih doesn’t tax the device’s resources, quality is maintained throughout a live streaming event, even if the user moves from one app or game to another. Unikel Global maintains over 30 server locations globally to ensure low latency, and minimal lag and buffering no matter where the user is. All live streamed data is protected by industry-standard encryption. Vidih is optimized for a variety of social uses, including live streaming a mobile game to Twitch, demonstrating an app’s functionality to a Facebook Live audience, or capturing apps that cannot otherwise be recorded, like SnapChat or iOS itself. Few iOS apps have built-in live streaming functionality, but with Vidih, users have a powerful workaround that respects Apple’s rules.  About Unikel Global LTD Founded in 2013, Unikel Global LTD (http://unikelglobal.com/) specializes in hardware design, telecoms, software and mobile security. The company’s services are typically provided on a referral basis; Vidih is Unikel Global’s first direct-to-consumer product. iPhone, iPad and iPod users can test Vidih for free by visiting https://vidih.com/ from their iOS devices. Set-up takes just seconds, with no sign-up form or software installation required.

U.S. Editions Australia Edition China Edition India Edition Italy Edition Japan Edition Singapore Edition United Kingdom United States May 10, 2:53 AM EDT Subscribe Search Search Business Technology World National Media & Culture Millennial Money Entertainment Sports Subscribe Technology WWDC 2017 Keynote Date: What Will Apple Announce At Its Annual Event? By Denisse Moreno On 05/09/17 AT 5:43 PM Close Apple confirmed its keynote address for its upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) by sending press invitations for the June event Tuesday, MacRumors reported. Apple will hold the keynote event on June 5 at 10 a.m. PDT in San Jose, California. The WWDC 2017 will consist of get-togethers, sessions and labs for developers, plus a keynote address. Last year, Apple unveiled iOS 10, which revamped iMessage and the Photos and Maps apps, along with other features. This year could include big announcements on the Apple TV, iOS 11 and the rumored Siri speaker. Read: Apple Original Content: Doc On 'Harry Styles: Behind the Album' On The Way Here’s a roundup of what Apple could announce in its Keynote event this June: Apple TV and tvOS 11 Apple is rumored to introduce new features for the Apple TV’s tvOS 11 update, which could be announced at WWDC. The new update will allow for multiuser use, Israeli blog the Verifier said last month. The feature will allow users to create their own profiles and have tailored content, and switch in and out of profiles, similar to Netflix. Apple TV users will be able to make their own profiles through an iOS device and by connecting their Apple ID. The update also will allow users to listen to their Apple Music content, view their iCloud photos and videos, and use their apps once their Apple ID is linked to the Apple TV. tvOS 11 will also come with a picture-in-picture feature, which will allow users to minimize the window of a movie or video to the corner of the screen and surf through another app. The rumored tvOS 11 updates could help Apple against competitors, like the Amazon Fire TV and Roku. Apple is also looking to break into live TV programming and could introduce a monthly subscription with its next update, the Verifier reported. Last month, it was rumored Apple was looking into selling a premium TV bundle that would include HBO, Showtime and Starz. Meanwhile, a Bloomberg report said in February Apple was testing a new Apple TV that supports ultra-high-definition 4K streaming. Siri Speaker Apple could introduce its rumored Siri speaker, a rival to Amazon’s Echo devices, during the WWDC keynote address.  KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said earlier this month there is an "over 50 percent chance” the speaker will be revealed at WWDC. Kuo also said the Siri speaker will have “excellent” acoustics performance, which will help it compete with Echo devices. The Siri speaker is rumored to cost more than the Amazon Echo and is expected to have a performance similar to the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S. iPhone leaker Sonny Dickson tweeted last week Apple was “finalizing designs for their Alexa competitor” and was “expected to be marketed as a Siri/AirPlay device.” Read: Unclear If Siri Speaker Will Have Display Screen Like Amazon's Echo Show iOS 11 Apple could also give fans a preview of iOS 11, which is expected to be launched in September alongside the iPhone 8, iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus. Rumors suggest iOS 11 will come with Theater Mode, which will provide users with limited access to a device and will dim the screen display to avoid annoying others at the movies. Apple Original Content The upcoming iOS 11 is expected to come with a revamped Music App that will better showcase Apple’s original video content, a recent Bloomberg report said. The company’s upcoming projects could be revealed at WWDC with information about iOS 11. Apple is expected to release as many as 10 original shows and documentaries by the end of the year, including will.i.am’s Planet of the Apps and Carpool Karaoke. Apple is also said to be working on documentaries about hip-hop labels Bad Boy Records and Cash Money Records and another about music impresario Clive Davis. The company recently released a trailer for its upcoming Apple Music documentary on former One Direction singer Harry Styles, which will stream Monday. The company is also expected to reveal macOS 10.13, watchOS 4, and developments in Apple Pay and Apple Music.

The conference will be held at the McEnery Convention Center in San Jose, CA, from June 5th to June 9th, with the keynote on June 5th. WWDC 2017 Keynote Press Invite Reading the Invite Tea Leaves Reading the tea leaves of Apple’s invitations is somewhere between a national pastime and an international sport. But…I got nothing on this one. People working? Accidental connections? Spontaneous meetings? People walking? Developers doing developer things? But, you gotta love the negative-space Apple logo. WWDC Keynote in San Jose, CA This marks the first time since 2002 that Apple will hold its WWDC in San Jose. It’s in Apple’s backyard, making the commute for Apple employees shorter. Not coincidentally, it will also make the commute for attending developers to visit Apple Park substantially more convenient. Expectations Apple rarely announces new hardware at WWDC, choosing to focus on new versions of macOS and iOS instead. But, Apple has shipped next to nothing in the last 8 months, namely AirPods in December 2016, a (RED) iPhone and cheaper iPad in 2017. Accordingly, many are hoping Apple will use the event or the press interest surrounding the event to announce something. Anything. Possibilities include new iPad Pro models, an updated iPhone SE, MacBook or MacBook Air, Mac mini, iMac, or the newly rumored home Siri device.

The extended warranty is for Apple's Smart Keyboard device that people can connect to their iPad Pro tablets to use to type instead of using the touch screen, according to a report this week by tech publication 9to5Mac. Under the warranty, people who bought a Smart Keyboard for either the 12.9- and 9.7-inch versions of the iPad Pro will be entitled to free repairs for up to three years instead of the usual one year. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter. Apple sent an internal memo to its retail store employees and partner service providers on Friday that said it discovered “functional issues” with the keyboards that need to be fixed, the report said. Some of the problems with the keyboard include sticky keys that cause repeat typing, connection errors, and unresponsive keys. Apple (aapl) currently offers a one-year warranty for all of its various devices and accessories. The new warranty extends the existing warranty for another two years to cover the Smart Keyboards. Apple debuted its iPad Pro in 2015 as a more business-friendly tablet that, with the help of a detachable keyboard, makes it more suitable for the workplace—much like Microsoft’s (msft) Surface tablet. The 9.7-inch version of the Smart Keyboard sells for $150 while the larger model costs $170. For more about technology and finance, watch: Fortune contacted to Apple for more information including how many keyboards were affected, and we'll update this story if it responds.

The trouble is that the firm's standing is largely built on the success of the aging iPhone.  By JEFF SOMMER New York Times May 9, 2017 — 4:41pm Minh Uong - New York Times $776 billion: Apple’s world-beating market capitalization is dependent on the iPhone’s financial magic. Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on: Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink: Purchase: Order Reprint Great things are expected of the most valuable company on the planet. Apple, which has a world-beating market capitalization of $776 billion, is still meeting those expectations, but barely. And that could cause headaches down the road for investors and for the stock market as a whole. Apple shares, among the most widely held in the world, hit a record Friday, yet the company’s sales have been so-so and no new game-changing gadgets other than a revamped iPhone are in sight. “Apple has ushered itself squarely into a new normal of pedestrian growth,” Edison Investment Research said, summing up the market reaction to Apple’s latest quarterly earnings report In a nutshell, after a stumble last year, Apple started to grow again late in the year and continued to do so in the first three months of this year, but not by much. Revenue in the first quarter was 5 percent higher than over the same period a year earlier — a respectable but hardly eye-popping performance, and one that won’t restore Apple’s old reputation as a paradigmatic “growth company.” Yet Apple’s stock rose last week, after increasing more than 28 percent this year. The company generates profits on a barely conceivable scale. So what’s the problem? It is simply that Apple’s standing in the stock market has largely been built on that aging little object, the iPhone. A major iPhone rejuvenation is expected in September, the 10th anniversary of its birth. That is likely to spur greater sales, for a while at least. But how long can the iPhone wield its financial magic, and will the company come up with another invention with awesome monetary powers? It may seem unfair to quibble this way, given Apple’s technological accomplishments and financial position. The company makes useful and reliable, if expensive, products. I’m typing on a Mac, have an iPhone in my pocket and an iPad tucked away in my backpack, and all have served me well. The Apple Watch has its aficionados. But whatever your relationship with Apple devices, the company has not come up with a technological game changer in years. That hasn’t prevented its share price from powering upward. For the moment, the stock market remains entranced with what Apple is doing financially, and for understandable reasons. Apple may no longer be a great growth company but it is still extraordinary, said Aswath Damodaran, a New York University finance professor. Come what may, he said, Apple churns out staggering quantities of money with metronomic regularity. “Apple is the greatest corporate cash machine in history,” he said. “We should appreciate that amazing achievement. The problem is, it’s not growing much. It’s a slow-growth cash-generating machine.” On Tuesday, the company provided fresh details of how great a cash machine it is. In just three months, after expenses and investments and payouts to shareholders, Apple’s colossal pile of cash and marketable securities grew another $10.8 billion, reaching a nearly unfathomable $256.8 billion. In the scheme of things, how big is that? Consider that $256.8 billion is more than the value of every other U.S. company except Microsoft, Alphabet, Facebook, Exxon Mobil, Johnson & Johnson, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase, said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. Apple has enough cash for an outright purchase of General Electric or Wells Fargo or AT&T, the data show. There is speculation that Apple will make a major acquisition: Companies like Netflix, Disney, Hulu and Tesla are on analysts’ lists. But there is little sign right now that Apple intends to dispose of its money that way, in a gigantic acquisition. Instead, the company announced that it would expand its program of returning cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock buybacks. The numbers here, too, are so immense that they are hard to grasp. In a conference call with stock analysts, Luca Maestri, Apple’s chief financial officer, said that since 2012, Apple’s buybacks and dividends amounted to $211.2 billion: The buybacks alone total $151 billion. Without those buybacks, which reduce Apple’s shares and total value, Apple’s market cap might already be as high as $900 billion (though without the buybacks, Apple’s stock price would be lower, so such calculations are inherently imprecise). Apple stashes nearly $240 billion of its cash offshore, out of reach of the IRS. Much of it will presumably return to the United States if the Trump administration lowers corporate tax rates, as it has proposed. Maestri said the company’s current plans for its cash reflect “the current tax legislation in this country, and there’s a lot that still needs to happen there, and we’ll see. Obviously, we will reassess our situation if things change.” Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst with Bernstein Research, said a favorable tax deal could add another $9 or so to Apple’s shares, which are trading at about $149. The expected redesign of the iPhone should also help the stock in the next several months, he said, because “we’ve found that Apple’s share price rises in the three to six months before the new phone comes out.” Apple stock is in that sweet spot now, he said. Like Damodaran, however, he remains skeptical about Apple’s longer-term growth prospects. “The company is so big that it takes a lot to move the needle for growth,” he said.

The firm is revising 2H17 iPhone shipments down to 80M - 90M units from 100M - 110M units Several new components to blame for problems Todd Haselton | @robotodd 9 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES show chapters The two things we're looking for from Apple in new iPhone cycle: Expert    15 Hours Ago | 03:39 The iPhone 8 may face huge shortages as production problems continue to crop up, according to an Apple analyst with a historical record of accurate predictions. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said on Tuesday that Apple is facing a "worst case scenario" wherein Apple might not be able to build as many units as originally expected, thanks to problems with new components. The note was obtained by 9to5Mac. "We are seeing more evidence that the worst-case scenario forecasted in our April 19 report could materialize, where new iPhone shipments in 2H17F are revised down to 80-90mn units from 100-110mn units (vs. consensus of 100-120mn units)," Kuo said. The analyst has previously suggested that Apple's iPhone 8 will be delayed to October or November due to issues related to merging new OLED panels with the fingerprint reader. Kuo is particularly concerned with "whether the 3D sensor of the OLED iPhone provides an innovate user experience; whether OLED iPhone cancels Touch ID (fingerprint recognition); and whether Apple's competitors launch more innovative products which could compete with OLED iPhone." Kuo isn't alone in his fears that the iPhone 8 won't make it to market in September, when Apple normally releases its new iPhones. Drexel Hamilton said in April that new 3D components and a new OLED display will cause the iPhone 8 to be delayed by "several weeks." Likewise, Cowen and Company said earlier this month that the iPhone 8 is facing a 4-6 week delay. Keep in mind that while these reports are certainly bearish on the iPhone 8, Apple is still expected to announce two other devices, the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus, which may still launch in September.

Sign Up Android Auto and Apple CarPlay are about to get really real Commentary: The way you access your phone from your car is going to change things forever, and that's great. Auto Tech by Tim Stevens May 9, 2017 5:00 AM PDT @Tim_Stevens Hyundai OK, I'll be honest, some of the most exciting tech of 2017 doesn't sound all that exciting on the surface. But bear with me, because it's going to be big. Ready? Smartphone integration in cars -- specifically Android Auto and Apple CarPlay -- is finally past the tipping point of revolutionizing our in-car experience. 50 Hitting the road in all three 2017 Hyundai Ioniq models That means that instead of squinting at your phone and tapping when you should have your eyes on the road and your hands on the wheel, more cars will be able to access the stuff inside your personal Android phone or iPhone from the dashboard. For example, you can easily navigate to an address in your contacts list, and play music with your voice. You won't be able to text with your hands, or -- perish the thought -- play games while you drive. Click for more stories. Aaron Robinson/CNET This amounts to a more convenient, safer, distraction-free way for drivers to use their phones. Study after study shows that using your phone while behind the wheel is at least as dangerous as drunk driving, and maybe even more so. Even reading a text message while you drive takes your eyes off the road for an average of 5 seconds, according to federal findings. That's long enough to get into a crash. So far, roughly 30 manufacturers have signed on to support Apple CarPlay and more than 50 are backing Android Auto on cars coming out this year. (Many manufacturers already support both, a boon for families with both Android and iPhone users.) After more than a decade of the automotive industry working toward this moment, the swell of support finally puts us at a point where compatibility will become the norm. It will change expectations about how you access content when you drive, and help make driving safer for everyone. More good things to come, like better apps Waze on Android Auto is happening... eventually. James Martin/CNET More cars on the road running Android Auto and Apple CarPlay means we'll inevitably see improvements for both platforms as Apple and Google make updates for a larger base of users. Both platforms are more than functional at this point, but still exceedingly basic. They don't allow for even the most rudimentary customization, like changing colors or wallpaper. You know, the sort of thing that Android and iOS have offered since the very beginning. I think that will change as more semi-satisfied users speak up. Google is starting to make some changes, too. It recently released a raft of updates to Android Auto, including tweaks that allow you to use the service even if you don't have a compatible car. Apple, for the moment, is staying mum about updates to CarPlay, but surely has some enhancements in the cards. (If we get lucky, we could hear more as soon as Apple's annual WWDC event next month.) More cars and better features will bring more users to the platform, and with that will come more apps that work from a tap on your car's head unit screen. Many of my favorites are already on Android Auto, like Spotify for music and BeyondPod for podcasts -- I've already signed in from my phone, so I won't need to sign in again or set my favorites. And, since I use Hangouts for all my messaging, I can still keep in touch while driving by using my voice, like sending a message to my wife that I'm running late. All I need to do is hit the voice button on the steering wheel, dictate my message, and away it goes. Easy. Still, there are plenty of notable missing apps, perhaps the biggest being Waze. That changes this year too, with an Android Auto-compatible flavor of Waze dropping soon. No word on when or if Google's crowd-sourced navigation/traffic app will be coming to CarPlay, but given how much Apple has that platform bolted down to outsiders, don't hold your breath. DIY CarPlay or Android Auto The Pioneer NEX series of receivers are compatible with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. Antuan Goodwin/CNET If you want to get onboard with the seamless merging of phone and car, but aren't ready to buy a new ride, you could buy a compatible aftermarket head unit from companies such as Pioneer. They're not new, but there are more choices than ever before, and they're cheaper than ever before, too. In the US, $400 will get you in the game; that's half the cost compared to when they were first released. It's not pocket change, but it's a heckuva lot cheaper than buying a new car. Either way you go, it's time to buckle in. More cars on the road with CarPlay and Android Auto mean better services, more apps and, ultimately, a lot fewer distracted drivers trying to use their phones while driving. That is something to be excited about indeed.

We imagine it’d be easier to get out of the Mafia than it would be to get a prototype iPhone out of Infinite Loop. After all, who could forget the kerfuffle caused when a prototype iPhone 4 got into the hands of a tech blog, via an employee who left it in a California bar? Well, seven years on from that unsavory incident, Apple is reportedly sending its latest product out into the wild for testing before a presumed announcement at WWDC next month. A Bloomberg source says Apple employees have been testing the Siri-powered answer to the Amazon Echo in their homes for the last few months. If true, Apple’s approach would be prudent, given our personal experiences with the likes of Google Home and Amazon Echo. While features can sound interesting on paper, it’s only through day-to-day use in the home that each user discovers what really works for them. Related: Amazon Echo tips and tricks Apple’s Siri-powered device is expected to arrive with a more premium design than some of its rivals. A recent update from noted Apple leaker Sonny Dickson suggested it’d look like a Mac Pro combined with a UE Boom. The most recent reports this week suggested it pay have a built-in screen like the Amazon Echo Show. Given the WWDC keynote gets underway on June 5, we might not have long to wait to find out. Is Apple about to disrupt the smart home arena with its belated entry? Or is Amazon already too far ahead.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: Moe Slah The iPhone 8 may be impossible to find at launch Yoni Heisler @edibleapple May 9th, 2017 at 5:14 PM Share Tweet Apple’s upcoming iPhone 8 is without question the company’s most anticipated product in years. Said to feature an edge-to-edge OLED display, the hype surrounding Apple’s next-gen iPhone seems to get more intense with each passing month. And with good reason: the iPhone 8 will introduce a radical new form factor, a welcome change in light of the fact that the current iPhone design has more or less remained unchanged since Apple rolled out the iPhone 6 in 2014. Don't Miss: Google has a new OS that may one day kill Android, and this is your first look at it Typically, Apple introduces a new iPhone model in September, but rumblings from the rumor mill have suggested that the iPhone 8 will see a delayed launch, with some reports indicating that the iPhone 8 release date will be delayed until November. And though a Digitimes report from earlier in the week claimed that Apple will get a handle on iPhone 8 production by September, a new research note from reputed analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says otherwise. Though iPhone 8 rumors are a dime a dozen these days, it’s always worth paying close attention to Kuo’s research notes. Indeed, no other analyst on the planet has as track record as long and as accurate as Kuo. That said, Kuo’s most recent note, obtained by MacRumors and 9to5Mac, relays that the iPhone 8 will be extremely hard to find due to “severe supply shortages.” So even if the iPhone 8 release goes down in September, it will reportedly take Apple some time to ramp up production. That being the case, Kuo notes that “severe supply shortages may persist for a while after the new models are launched…” Far from a surprise, we have seen other reports claiming that the advanced 3D cameras Apple is planning on incorporating on its upcoming flagship iPhone will be in extremely short supply once mass production begins. Additionally, there have also been rumblings that Apple has experienced extremely poor yields on its advanced 5.8-inch OLED display. With the iPhone 8 said to be in short supply this September, Kuo believes that Apple’s cumulative iPhone shipments will take a significant hit. We are seeing more evidence that the worst-case scenario forecasted in our April 19 report could materialize, where new iPhone shipments in 2H17F are revised down to 80- 90mn units from 100-110mn units (vs. consensus of 100-120mn units). … While we are positive on potential replacement demand triggered by OLED iPhone, it’s too early to determine if demand will shift fully in that direction. We recommend investors keep tabs on the following issues: (1) whether the 3D sensor of OLED iPhone provides an innovative user experience; (2) whether OLED iPhone cancels Touch ID (fingerprint recognition); and (3) whether Apple’s competitors launch more innovative products which could compete with OLED iPhone in 4Q17-2Q18. One question that remains unanswered centers on whether or not Apple will be able to incorporate the Touch ID sensor into the display itself or if it will place it on the back of the device.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 9 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Ten Companies Lead in Responding to Radical Market Change and Reinventing Themselves for a Different Future, According to New Analysis of Public Company Data /EINPresswire.com/ — LEXINGTON, MA–(Marketwired – May 9, 2017) – As the pace of change accelerates in virtually every industry, a new study has identified the 10 global companies that have done the best job of remaking their businesses. The list — which includes celebrated tech innovators like Amazon and Netflix as well as standouts from industries that don’t as frequently make innovation headlines, including health care company DaVita and food and beverage giant Danone — offers insights into how market leaders can sustain growth even as disruption threatens their historically successful core business. The Transformation 10, a new report by growth strategy consulting firm Innosight, analyzed 1,000 companies and engaged a panel of business leaders to identify the 10 companies whose transformations had the biggest impact on their respective industries and the most potential to be sustained. The judges included former P&G CEO A.G. Lafley, former Boeing Defense CEO Chris Chadwick, and Columbia business professor Rita Gunther McGrath. Online retailer Amazon and entertainment firm Netflix were tied atop the rankings, followed (in order) by travel-technology company Priceline; global tech firm Apple; health insurer Aetna; software company Adobe; health care firm DaVita; computer and software maker Microsoft; food and beverage company Danone; and steel maker ThyssenKrupp. „A company survives and thrives over time based not on its size at any given time, but on its ability to adapt to disruption and to reposition itself to create a new future. We believe that by identifying companies that are transforming successfully, we can gain a better understanding of the dynamics and success factors of transformation,” notes Innosight managing partner Scott Anthony, who is the co-author of the just-released Dual Transformation: How to Reposition Today’s Business While Creating the Future (Harvard Business Review Press). Each company in the Transformation 10 found a way to create new growth while repositioning its traditional business: 1. Online retail giant Amazon developed technology to streamline internal operations, then turned it into a cloud computing platform that Amazon began selling to outside customers as large as the U.S. government. Since beginning what is now Amazon Web Services (AWS) in 2006, the new growth area now delivers about 10% of revenue, and accounted for more than half of Amazon’s operating profit in 2015. At the same time, Amazon has steadily fortified its core online retail business with new categories, including a growing library of music, movies and original programming. 2. Video entertainment company Netflix began shifting its business model to include on-demand streaming as well as traditional hard-copy DVD rentals in 2007. That core business of hard-copy rentals continues to exist, albeit in a diminished state. Meanwhile, Netflix’s domestic and international streaming business posted almost 90% of the firm’s revenue in 2015, and the company has been producing and commissioning its own content since 2013, another potential source of growth. 3. Travel-technology company Priceline was already the world leader in online travel in 2010, when it decided to provide a more complete service that included the „long tail” of travel suppliers beyond the major hotels (e.g., independent hotels, apartment buildings). To capture that new growth, Priceline acquired companies like Bookings.com and KAYAK, and the new growth business generated about 25% of revenue in 2015. Simultaneously, Priceline recalibrated its core business around helping customers plan a complete travel experience — much like an online concierge. 4. Beginning in 2007, computer giant Apple moved beyond its successful computer hardware business to create the world’s biggest ecosystem for digital content — and then to build on that ecosystem with new devices like the iPhone. Apple continues to be a manufacturer of computers, but the revenue from the firm’s digital networks and related products now accounts for 80% of the company. 5. Health insurer Aetna’s traditional model of selling health insurance through employers has grown nearly 80% over the last four years. Starting in 2010, the firm also began selling care management directly to consumers, and health care IT services to providers. Revenue from these newer, „value-based” contracts now accounts for about 40% of overall firm revenue. 6. Software company Adobe dominated the market for creating and designing documents and images, thanks to brands like Photoshop, Illustrator and Acrobat. But by 2008, fearing a saturated user base and a shift to cloud-based business models, the firm announced a new focus on digital marketing and analytics through a software as a service (SaaS) business model. The core business of packaged creative software lives on as the Creative Cloud subscription service, and new growth through digital marketing now creates almost half (45%) of overall revenue. 7. Health care firm DaVita specialized in kidney dialysis, making its money on a traditional fee-for-service business model and becoming one of the largest operators in its field. But starting in 2012, DaVita began building an „integrated delivery network” to deliver dialysis care as well as manage patients’ total healthcare. The core business — dialysis care — has nearly doubled over the last 10 years, while new growth now delivers 30% of total revenue. 8. Computer firm Microsoft continues to sell hardware and software; its legacy business offering still accounts for about half the company. But, starting in 2010, the firm made a bet on embracing cloud-based technology — while building up its hardware business. Its Intelligent Cloud business, which includes Azure and on-premises server software, reported 2016 revenue of more than $25 billion, almost a third (32%) of the company total. 9. French food and beverage firm Danone moved beyond its traditional yogurt business to grow a portfolio of health brands, including baby foods and other early life nutrition products. Those newer brands now generate 29% of Danone’s revenue, up from just 3% in 2006. At the same time, a slimmed-down core business, refocused on healthy yogurts and other nutritional foods, is still profitable and accounts for the majority of the business. 10. German steel maker ThyssenKrupp, under pressure from low-cost producers in Asia, decided to move drastically away from making and selling steel. Instead, in 2012 the firm began investing in industrial solutions, providing capital equipment, software and services to manufacturers, including refineries and automakers. The new growth area already accounts for 47% of total company revenue. The Transformation 10 report highlights a few takeaways and lessons that can help business leaders respond to market disruption and position their companies for the future, including: Transformational CEOs tend to be „insider outsiders.” Typically it’s not a complete outsider who instigates the change, but a leader who worked at the edges of the organization or in a parallel part of the industry. Transformation involves two separate journeys. The most effective transformation efforts are not monolithic but take a two-pronged approach: repositioning the core business while creating the future growth business. Transformation can only take root if you are constantly telling a story about the future. To transform a company, the CEO must also act as the „storyteller in chief.” That means telling different aspects of the same transformation narrative to all the constituencies and stakeholders in and of the company. Develop a roadmap for transformation before disruption takes hold. By the time the need to transform is clear, it is often too late. Leaders need to stay ahead of new technologies and competitors that can derail their business and act before fault lines are entirely clear. ABOUT THE TRANSFORMATION 10 RESEARCH The research focused on 57 companies from the S&P 500 and Global 500 that had made significant public commitments to transformation. The analysis evaluated public companies through three lenses: new growth, success in repositioning the core, and select financial metrics.  To assess areas of new growth, Innosight measured how successful these companies have been at creating new products, services, markets and business models, and in that process determined the percent of revenue that can be attributed to new growth areas. To measure success in repositioning the core business, Innosight examined how effectively these companies adapted their traditional businesses to changes or disruptions in their markets. The financial metrics that Innosight analyzed combined annual growth rate (CAGR) of each company’s revenue and stock price, as well as overall profitability, during their respective transformation periods. After narrowing down to a list of 18 companies, Innosight worked with a panel of business leaders to identify the 10 companies whose transformations had the biggest impact on their respective industries and the most potential to be sustained. The judges were: Chris Chadwick, former CEO, Boeing Defense; Clay Christensen, Professor, Harvard Business School and Innosight co-founder; Scott Cook, Founder and Chairman of Intuit; Matthew Eyring, Chief Strategy and Innovation Officer at Vivint; A.G. Lafley, former CEO of Procter & Gamble; Rita McGrath, Professor, Columbia Business School; Teo Ming Kian, Director Temasek and Chairman Vertex Holdings; Theodor Weimer, Country Chairman, UniCredit.

Stocks are opening slightly higher on Wall Street, Monday, May 1, 2017, led by gains in technology companies and banks. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) Updated at 3:38 p.m. NEW YORK • The S&P 500 fell on Tuesday after edging up to an intra-day record high for the second straight session, while Apple became the first U.S. company to close with a market capitalization above $800 billion. Better-than-expected quarterly earnings from U.S. companies and Emmanuel Macron's victory in the French presidential election on Sunday have given investors confidence, but valuations for U.S. stocks are already higher than average. The hope that President Donald Trump will cut corporate and personal taxes remained in focus for investors. "Earnings are improving and the potential for tax reform plays a big role. Why would you want to sell stocks here when you might get a tax break later on?" said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist for Robert W. Baird & Co. Apple rose 0.64 percent to end at $153.99, giving it a market valuation of $802.9 billion, a first for a U.S. company. Investors are optimistic the Cupertino, Calif., company will mark the 10th anniversary of the iPhone by launching a model with new features. "It's a real testament to what they've accomplished," said Rick Meckler, president of investment firm LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, N.J. However, he said Apple's massive size could hamper its ability to keep growing. The Dow Jones industrial average declined 0.17 percent to end at 20,975.78 points and the S&P 500 lost 0.10 percent to 2,396.92 points. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.29 percent to close at a record high of 6,120.59, helped by Apple. After the bell, videogame maker Electronic Arts jumped 3.9 percent following its fiscal fourth-quarter report. Four of the 11 major S&P sectors rose during Tuesday's session, led by consumer discretionary, while the typically defensive plays such as utilities and telecom services fell.

So even though Apple saw an increase in revenue last quarter, not to mention increasing its earnings per share from $1.90 to $2.20 year-on-year, the 1% drop in iPhone sales last quarter prompted shares of Apple to drop a bit in after-hours trading and on the day following its earnings release. Don't Miss: Amazon just discounted the Echo for the first time in 2017 Since then, Apple’s share price has not only rebounded, it has ascended to record-setting heights. At the close of trading on Friday, Apple shares were trading at $148.96, amounting to a 41.8% increase over the last six months. Clearly, Wall St. is less concerned with the “pause” in iPhone sales Apple experienced last quarter and more excited by the prospects of what the iPhone 8 will do for Apple’s bottom line. And speaking to how impactful investors believe the iPhone 8 will be, Apple’s share price has been seemingly unaffected by a slew of reports suggesting that the iPhone 8 release date may be pushed back as far as November. In any other year, such news would likely send Apple shares tumbling. Quantifying the optimism surrounding the iPhone 8, MacRumors got its hands on research notes from 19 individual analysts in the wake of Apple’s Q2 earnings report. Impressively, 15 of the 19 analysts believe shares of Apple will appreciate considerably in the months ahead. More specifically, 12 analysts believe Apple shares will hit a minimum price of $160. On the bullish side of the equation, analysts Brian White and Robert Cihra believe Apple shares will hit $185 and $180, respectively. On the bearish end of the spectrum, Sherri Scribner of Deutsche Bank believes Apple shares will fall to $130 while Mark Moskowitz of Barclays sees Apple shares falling all the way down to $123. While trying to time the market is a tried and true way to lose a lot of money quickly, the broader takeaway here is that the iPhone is poised for a huge resurgence. Though iPhone sales have been robust in recent years, the last time Apple saw a spectacular increase in iPhone growth was back when it released the iPhone 6 in 2014. The iPhone 8 is in a good position to change that, however. Aside from introducing a new form factor to a design that has arguably outworn its welcome, the current installed base of iPhone users looking to upgrade is greater today than at any other point in history. Accordingly, many analysts are anticipating that iPhone 8 will prompt a “super cycle” refresh that will leave Apple scrambling to meet unprecedented demand. Think of it this way: if the iPhone 7 — with no new form factor or revolutionary new features — managed to keep iPhone sales steady, just imagine what the iPhone 8 — with a brand new form factor and a slew of new features — will do once it finally starts shipping.

Photos Videos Topics Live Cricket Score Home India Mumbai Delhi World Business Technology Sports IPL Entertainment Bollywood Hollywood Television Lifestyle Education & Careers TRENDING# Kapil Mishra Emmanuel Macron Narendra Modi Exam results 2017 Bahubali 2 News Technology News US STOCKS-Wall Street loses oomph but Apple crosses $800-billion mark Shares1 Wed, 10 May 2017-02:12am , Reuters The S&P 500 fell on Tuesday after edging up to an intra-day record high for the second straight session, while Apple became the first U.S. company to close with a market capitalization above $800 billion. Better-than-expected quarterly earnings from U.S. companies and Emmanuel Macron's victory in the French presidential election on Sunday have given investors confidence, but valuations for U.s. stocks are already higher than average. The hope that U.S. President Donald Trump will cut corporate and personal taxes remained in focus for investors. "Earnings are improving and the potential for tax reform plays a big role. Why would you want to sell stocks here when you might get a tax break later on?" said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist for Robert W. Baird & Co. Apple rose 0.64 percent to end at $153.99, giving it a market valuation of $802.9 billion, a first for a U.S. company. Investors are optimistic the Cupertino, California company will mark the 10th anniversary of the iPhone by launching a model with suped-up features. "It's a real testament to what they've accomplished," said Rick Meckler, president of investment firm LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey. However, he said Apple's massive size could hamper it's ability to keep growing. The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.17 percent to end at 20,975.78 points and the S&P 500 lost 0.10 percent to 2,396.92 points. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.29 percent to close at a record high of 6,120.59, helped by Apple. After the bell, videogame maker Electronic Arts jumped 3.9 percent following its fiscal fourth-quarter report. Four of the 11 major S&P sectors rose during Tuesday's session, led by consumer discretionary, while the typically defensive plays such as utilities and telecom services fell. Energy dropped 0.86 percent on the back of falling oil prices. Shares of Valeant Pharmaceuticals jumped 24 percent after the company posted its first profit in six quarters. Sturm Ruger & Company jumped 9.85 percent, leading other gun makers higher after its quarterly report suggested a drop in demand after Trump's election may be bottoming out. Endo International, Office Depot and Marriott also rose after reporting better-than-expected quarterly earnings. Wayfair surged 20.73 percent to an all-time high after the online furniture retailer revenue beat analysts' expectations. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.31-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.02-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 42 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 120 new highs and 59 new lows. About 6.7 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, in line with the daily average over the last 20 sessions.

(AP Photo/Paul Sakuma, file) AP Tuesday, May 09, 2017 01:53PM SANTA FE, N.M. -- A techno-infused opera about the life of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs has earned the financial backing of opera companies in San Francisco and Seattle, ensuring the musical meditation on the iconic entrepreneur will travel to America's high-tech enclave. The partnerships were announced Tuesday as the Santa Fe Opera prepared for its July world premiere of "The (R)evolution of Steve Jobs" at its open-air summer stage in the foothills of New Mexico's Sangre de Cristo Mountains. The Seattle Opera and the San Francisco Opera are underwriting both the already completed artistic creation of the opera, led by composer and electronica DJ Mason Bates, and its physical stage production. As co-producers, the companies guarantee their right to performances beyond Santa Fe in California and Washington. The Jacobs School of Music at Indiana University also has signed on as a co-producer. Job's life story, as the relentless technology pioneer who embraced Buddhism and simple vegetarian family dinners, has been the subject of documentaries, books, a feature film and a graphic novel since his death from cancer in 2011. RELATED: Apple co-founder Steve Jobs dies Sponsors of the Jobs opera are counting on Bates and librettist Mark Campbell to deliver a "deeply layered, moving portrayal of a man grappling with the complex priorities of life, family and work," in the words of San Francisco opera General Manager Matthew Shilvock. "He was also a real person and a member of our community," Shilvock said of Jobs in a written announcement. Charles MacKay, general director of the Santa Fe Opera, said Jobs provides the "sort of heroic, tragic figure" that operas have explored for centuries - who also may lure new and younger audiences to metropolitan opera houses. "The proof is in the pudding and in how the audience responds," MacKay told the Associated Press. "This is not an opera about technology, although it will be the highest technology production that we've ever done. It is an opera about relationships, and it is an opera about human frailties. ... He could be a very difficult man." Accompaniments include a live orchestra, guitar, natural sounds and expressive electronics - sounds tailored to the man who first won fame and fortune during the microcomputer revolution of the 1970s and 80s with partner Steve Wozniak as they introduced the pivotal Apple II and Macintosh computers. Fired by Apple in 1984, Jobs went into the visual effects industry at Pixar before his return to Apple as CEO to preside over the heyday of the early iPhone and related gadgets - also becoming a music and media mogul. MacKay cautioned that "The (R)evolution of Steve Jobs" could take a few years to reach the Bay Area and beyond - normal delays in the painstaking opera planning cycle. Investments as a co-producer can pay financial dividends if the opera sells tickets and eventually travels the country, or world. The Santa Fe Opera brokered a collaborative hit with other companies with the 2015 opera premiere of "Cold Mountain," adapted from the 1997 novel and popular film. Seed money for the Jobs opera was provided by the National Endowment for the Arts. From Santa Fe, MacKay has been outspoken in pushing back against President Donald Trump's proposed elimination of the endowment from the federal budget, with funding recently extended through the end of the current fiscal year in September.

REUTERS/ By Chuck Mikolajczak NEW YORK (Reuters) - Apple Inc became the first U.S. company to top the $800 billion mark in market capitalization on Tuesday, slightly more than two years after it crossed the $700 billion threshold. The iPhone maker's shares have gained 33 percent this year and almost 50 percent since the U.S. election in November. The company represents about 4 percent of the $21.7 trillion that makes up the entire S&P 500 <.SPX> index. Apple accounted for as much as 4.9 percent of the S&P 500 in September 2012 but is a smaller percentage now as the index as a whole has rallied more than 7 percent this year. "It's just reflective of how powerful a franchise it is. It may be the most powerful franchise in the country today," said Rick Meckler, president of LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey, whose firm does not own the stock. "Considering that it has a limited number of products, it has really dominated that market in a way that few companies have, and it's been able to retain margins despite lots of competitors." If Apple continues on its growth path, the company will top the $1 trillion market cap level later this year. Stock buybacks have also bolstered Apple shares, with the company reducing its actual share count by 20.9 percent and the average diluted shares outstanding by 20.5 percent over the past four years, according to Standard & Poor's data. The median price target on Apple is $160, up from the $140 median three months ago. Shares closed at $153.99 on Tuesday. The closing market cap of $802.8 billion was larger than the economies of 45 of the 50 U.S. states, topped only by Illinois, Florida, New York, Texas and California. Billionaire Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway has disclosed a stake of roughly $20 billion in Apple, said on Monday he had grown more fond of the company because he could "very easily determine" the iPhone maker's competitive position "and who is trying to chase them."

Apple sends out invites for June 5th event expected to see its Siri smart home speaker unveiled (and maybe even a sneak peek of the iPhone 8) Analyst claims speaker will be Apple's 'first home AI product' Could be marketed as a 'Siri/AirPlay device' and boast Beats technology Some say Apple could unveil the device at its Worldwide Developers Conference By Mark Prigg For Dailymail.com Published: 16:23 EDT, 9 May 2017 | Updated: 16:46 EDT, 9 May 2017 e-mail 3 View comments Apple has sent out invites to key press for the keynote of its Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose on June 5th. The firm is rumoured to be unveiling a smart speaker using its Siri assistant at the event to take on Amazon's Echo range and  Google Home. The firm is also expected to unveil the next version of its iOS software, with some analysts claiming it may even give a sneak peek of the next iPhone. Scroll down for video The keynote address will take place on June 5th in San Jose, and Apple is rumoured to be unveiling a smart speaker using its Siri assistant at the event to take on Amazon's Echo range and Google Home. A JP Morgan analyst has suggested there is a 'high likelihood' that the tech giant will preview the iPhone 8 at the World Developers Conference in June – a move that breaks five years of tradition. However, the New York-based financial firm has not supported its prediction with any real evidence.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next How you can stop your job being taken by a robot:... Would a free pair of AirPods ease the pain of the iPhone 8¿s... Amazon's $230 Echo Show is unveiled with video calling and a... Amazon launches exclusive music concerts for its Prime... Share this article Share KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo is one of those who says the firm will unveil the Siri speaker at WWDC. The product is believed to be aimed at bringing Appl'e AI into the home, and will have a higher price tag that the Amazon range, which begins at $49 for the Echo Dot.  AMAZON'S ECHO SHOW  After weeks of anticipation, Amazon has finally launched its new Echo Show smart assistant. The voice-controlled speaker features a 7-inch touchscreen display, which can be used to make video calls After weeks of anticipation, Amazon has finally launched its new Echo Show smart assistant.  The voice-controlled speaker features a 7-inch touchscreen display, which can be used to make video calls and playback video content. It will be available in white or black, and officially launches in the US on June 28 at a retail price of $229.99 (£179). On its website, Amazon said: 'Echo Show brings you everything you love about Alexa, and now she can show you things.  'Watch video flash briefings and YouTube, see music lyrics, security cameras, photos, weather forecasts, to-do and shopping lists, and more.  'All hands-free - just ask.'  The device weighs 2.6 pounds (1.1 kilograms), which suggests it won't be seen as a mobile phone replacement.  The new device is the fourth Echo-branded product, and comes three years after the first Amazon Echo launched in 2014.      According to 9to5 Mac, Kuo calls it ‘Apple’s first home AI product’, and says it will feature ‘excellent’ sound with seven tweeters and a subwoofer. 'It will be positioned as a more premium product than the Echo … with a higher price tag to match, the site says. According to Kuo, Apple hopes to ship around 10 million of these as-yet-unannounced devices in the first year, and it will be made by Inventec, the same company that made  Apple’s AirPods.  A recent leak has revealed the Cupertino company is 'currently finalizing' its own smart speaker, which is said to be marketed as a 'Siri/AirPlay device'. The latest news also noted that the Siri-driven device could 'carry some form of Beats technology and is expected to run on variant iOS'.  Apple is getting closer to unleashing its secret weapon to take on Amazon's Echo. A new leak has revealed that the Cupertino company is 'currently finalizing' its own smart speaker, which is said to be marketed as a 'Siri/AirPlay device' APPLE'S SIRI-DRIVEN SMART SPEAKER Sonny Dickson, who is known for sharing inside information in the tech world, revealed that Apple is 'currently finalizing' its smart speaker that will be marketed as a 'Siri/AirPlay device'. Adding Airplay support to the device would let users push music, radio, and podcasts to the Apple hardware over Wi-Fi, which typically offers better quality than Bluetooth.  He also revealed details that it could 'carry some form of Beats technology and is expected to run on variant iOS'. Dickson also told Mashable that it would have a 'concave top' with the controls, 'Mac Pro style.' Although it is not clear if the rumors are true, if Apple's smart speaker does hit the market 'it would be Apple's most significant piece of new hardware' since debuting the Apple Watch in 2014'. The latest rumor regarding Apple's secretive smart speaker was shared to Twitter by Sonny Dickson, who is known for sharing inside information in the tech world. Not only did he mention the device is near completion, but he also revealed details that it could 'carry some form of Beats technology and is expected to run on variant iOS'. Dickson also told Mashable that it would have a 'concave top' with the controls, 'Mac Pro style.' But that is all of the information the well-known leaker had to share. Adding Airplay support to the device would let users 'push music, radio, and podcasts to the Apple hardware over Wi-Fi, which typically offers better quality than Bluetooth,' Apple Insider reported. According to 9to5 Mac, KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo calls it ‘Apple’s first home AI product’, and says it will feature ‘excellent’ sound with seven tweeters and a subwoofer. However, Apple has yet to make an official announcement regarding their Siri-enabled smart speaker, so it is not clear when  or if it will be released.  But the tech giant is known for unveiling new  technologies at its Worldwide Developers Conference in June, which has some speculating the firm could show off the smart speaker then - with a possible fall release.  The latest rumor regarding Apple's secretive smart speaker was shared to Twitter by Sonny Dickson, who is known for sharing inside information in the tech world. It could also 'carry some form of Beats technology and is expected to run on variant iOS' Dickson's news is not the first time Apple's smart speaker has made its way to the masses. Last September, two people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg that Apple is attempting to differentiate itself from the other firms with more advanced microphone and speaker technology. And some of the technology in the prototype includes facial recognition sensors, another source revealed. These tips coincides with Apple's purchase of the facial recognition startups Faceshift and Emotient over the past two years.  However, Apple has yet to make an official announcement regarding their Siri-enabled smart speaker, so it is not clear when or if it will be released. But the tech giant is known for unveiling new technologies at its Worldwide Developers Conference in June, which has some speculating the firm could show off the smart speaker then The two firms appear to play key roles in creating a device that adapts to a room or a person's emotional state. Users would also have the ability to use the same Siri features with the device that they enjoy with their iPhone. Apple has also considered integrating mapping information into the speaker, another person said, which could notify users when it is time to leave their house for an appointment. News about a 'Siri speaker' was first brought to light in May by Amir Efrati of The Information who wrote, 'Apple is upping its game in the field of intelligent assistants'. Dickson's news is not the first time Apple's smart speaker has made its way to the masses - reports surfaced last year that suggested Apple has a secret weapon to take on Amazon's Echo (pictured) 'After years of internal debate and discussion about how to do so, the company is preparing to open up Siri to apps made by others. 'And it is working on an Amazon Echo-like device with a speaker and microphone that people can use to turn on music, get news headlines or set a timer.' Apple showed its interested in the smart-home space with the launch of HomeKit in 2014, which lets third-party smart-home accessory makers integrate with Siri. This was also the same year Apple began its work with the Siri-powered speakers.

MailOnline puts Sony's XB40 to the test Sony SRS-XB40 has a built-in multi-coloured line light, speaker lights and a flashing strobe.

U.S. Editions Australia Edition China Edition India Edition Italy Edition Japan Edition Singapore Edition United Kingdom United States May 10, 2:49 AM EDT Subscribe Search Search Business Technology World National Media & Culture Millennial Money Entertainment Sports Subscribe Technology Unclear If Siri Speaker Will Have Display Screen Like Amazon's Echo Show By Denisse Moreno On 05/09/17 AT 4:21 PM Close Amazon revealed the Echo Show Tuesday, and with coverage of the Alexa gadget came rumors about Apple’s upcoming Siri speaker. Apple employees have been testing the Siri speaker in their homes for several months, sources familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. So far, it’s unknown whether Apple’s upcoming Siri speaker will come with a built-in display, like Amazon’s Echo Show. Marketing chief Phil Schiller said last week in an interview he thinks voice assistant devices are beneficial, but that doesn't mean you'd never want a screen. Read: Apple Siri Speaker: 5 Expected Features Including Improved Beats Audio, Touchscreen KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo previously said there’s a more than 50 percent chance Apple could announce its Siri speaker at the Worldwide Developers Conference this June. Apple would be late in the market of voice-assistant speakers, following Amazon’s multiple Alexa devices and the Google Home. Amazon is expected to control 70 percent of the voice-enabled speaker device market this year, a forecast from eMarketer released this week predicted. Apart from the Echo Show, Amazon revealed the Echo Look late last month. The device includes LED lighting and a depth-sensing camera. The $199.99 gadget acts as a “style assistant” by taking full-length pictures of your outfits and judging your fashion taste. The Echo Look with a built-in screen comes with voice and video calling features and carries out other tasks. The device allows users to buy products on Amazon and shows connected security cameras and baby monitors on the screen, as well as allowing users see photos and weather updates. It also responds to other requests. However, Apple’s device could tackle problems found in Amazon’s devices. Kuo said the Siri speaker will have “excellent” acoustics performance, which will help it compete with Echo gadgets. Kuo also said the Siri speaker will cost more than the Amazon Echo, will support AirPlay and will have a performance similar to the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S. Read: New Amazon Echo Show: Preorder, Features, Price Revealed For Alexa-Powered Device With Built-In Screen No Apple Music On Echo Show The Echo Look streams music on Amazon’s Prime service, as well as Pandora, Spotify, TuneIn, iHeartRadio and others. However, the list does not include Apple Music, which could mean Apple is saving its streaming service for its own device. Amazon devices chief Dave Limp saying said Amazon would "love to have Apple, but they’re not super big” on opening up Apple Music integration, Bloomberg reported. This isn’t the first time Apple has clashed with Amazon. In 2015, Amazon stopped selling the Apple TV on its site (Amazon also discontinued the Google Chromecast). Amazon said at the time it didn’t want to confuse its customers if a product sold through Amazon does not support Prime Video. Apple TV does not support Amazon apps. However, the companies are rumored to be putting their differences aside for the TV box. Amazon will bring its Prime Video app to the Apple TV in the third quarter of this year. Previously, Apple users with Amazon Prime subscriptions had to rely on AirPlay to stream videos from their iOS device to the Apple TV.

While some wait to do anything at all until their phone gives them glass slivers, others go the repair route, shelling out up to $149 to Apple or other repair services to replace the cracked screen.  But that mental calculation depends a lot on Apple's traditional two-year upgrade cycle. Peaks and valleys In the past, Apple has used a two-year cycle when designing iPhones. A complete redesign of the phone is released every two years, then a more incremental model (the S model) is released in the year in between. It's that timeline — which Apple only recently moved away from with the release of the iPhone 7 — that has traditionally impacted when people opt to fix their screen. "We see peaks and valleys in consumer demand for repairs," AJ Forsythe, the founder and CEO of phone repair service iCracked, told Business Insider. "When the iPhone 7 came out, iPhone 6s repairs actually eclipsed iPhone 6 repairs. Consumers are more likely to fix their 6s than they are to fix their 6, because they’re one generation away."  "It doesn’t make sense for you to go buy an iPhone 7 because you break your 6s, but it does make more sense on the two-year cycle to go get the iPhone 7 from the iPhone 6," Forsythe said. iCracked has been around since 2010 and repairs both iPhones and Samsung devices in about 600 cities around the US. The company says it has done more than 518,000 repairs, and about 60% of its phone repairs are iPhones.  While iCracked doesn't release specific repair metrics, it tracked the rate of phone repair requests over time and compared them to the release dates of Apple's phones. iCracked found that the biggest uptick in repairs consistently falls right before the next generation phone is about to be released: Repair requests for the iPhone 5 spiked right before the release of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus in 2014 Requests for the 6 spiked right before the release of the 6s in 2015 Requests for the 6s spiked right before the launch of the 7 was released in 2016. Here's how that looks over the last four years: iCracked repair dataMore (iCracked) iCracked also tracked the life cycle of requests, and it's easy to see the spike and the tapering off of repairs with Apple's last few phones. As we get closer to the release of the next iPhone in September 2017, for example, requests to repair iPhone 6s devices are tapering off, as those users may be planning to buy the new phone instead of repairing their old one. The same thing happened with the iPhone 6, and the iPhone 5s before that. "We generally have an 18-24 month — I don’t want to call it a life cycle, but right now, our two most-requested device repairs are iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s, and it’s not iPhone 7," Forsythe said. "But we know from historical data that in 12 months, our most-requested device will be iPhone 7. It takes awhile for sale cycles to catch up." icracked iphone repair dataMore (iCracked) iCracked's data isn't a complete analysis of screen repairs, since people may use local repair services or go to Apple directly. For anyone with AppleCare+, an iPhone 7 Plus repair only costs $29 — iCracked's rates depend on the type of device, the type of repair, and your location, but can range upwards of $90.  But the data iCracked has been able to track is pretty clear: iPhone owners may not have been using logic when they let their $800 device hit a hard surface, but they are using logic when deciding whether — and when — to repair.  NOW WATCH: I've had the iPhone 6s Plus for over a year, and I'm so happy I didn't upgrade to the iPhone 7 More From Business Insider How to turn off emergency alerts on your iPhone China’s smartphone market is dominated by companies you’ve probably never heard of Here are the top iPhone apps made in every state Reblog Share Tweet Share Recently Viewed Your list is empty.

In an interview on " Squawk Box ," Palihapitiya said at first he misunderstood it. "The iOS business," Palihapitiya said.

"If you look at that business carefully, now I'm starting to get actually slightly more constructive on Apple than I've ever been," he said.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: The 3 Best Buffett Stocks for Retirees The Oracle of Omaha aims to buy companies that can stand the test of time. You should, too. Timothy Green, Brian Stoffel, and Cory Renauer (TMFBargainBin) May 9, 2017 at 4:02PM For retirees, Warren Buffett's portfolio offers plenty of solid companies with competitive advantages. Buffett gets it wrong sometimes, so investors shouldn't blindly mimic the billionaire's actions. But Buffett's positions are a good starting point for retirees. Here's why Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), General Motors (NYSE:GM), and DaVita (NYSE:DVA) are three great Buffett stocks for retirees.  A cash machine Brian Stoffel (Apple): Of all of the stocks Warren Buffett owns through Berkshire Hathaway, I think retirees should strongly consider buying shares of Apple -- and its current yield of 1.6% -- in May. Without a doubt, the biggest risk Apple faces is commoditization. Over the past 20 years, the company has survived by consistently coming out with the Next Big Thing -- first Macs, then iPods, then the iPhone and iPad. That's not the most sustainable moat to rely on. Image source: Apple. At the same time, the stock's price tag already reflects that reality. While Apple has almost a quarter-trillion in cash on its balance sheet against very little debt, and it generated an astounding $53 billion in free cash flow last year, shares trade for just 17 times earnings, a 30% discount to the market writ large.   At the same time, the iPhone 8 is just around the corner, and bears who have been betting against the popularity of the device have been disappointed again -- and again, and again. I don't see any reason that will change this upcoming holiday season. Given that only 23% of free cash flow was used to pay the dividend in 2016, I fully expect that retirees can count on increasing dividend checks from the company for year's to come -- and that's what retirement investing should be all about. Too cheap to ignore Tim Green (General Motors): Berkshire owns about $1.7 billion worth of General Motors, a stock that seems to be stuck trading at a pessimistic valuation. GM expects to produce between $6.00 and $6.50 in adjusted EPS this year, putting the forward P/E ratio around 5.5. There's a good reason GM stock is cheap. The U.S. auto market, after years of strong growth, is hitting a wall. U.S. auto sales slumped 4.7% in April, and GM was not immune. Weaker demand for cars means bigger discounts from manufacturers and potentially lower profits. GM's earnings may very well decline in the coming years, and the stock price reflects that. But I think the market is being too pessimistic. GM is a far more efficient company today than it was before the financial crisis. The market is pricing in a steep decline in profits. Anything short of that could send the stock soaring. Given GM's already low valuation and its 4.5% dividend yield, the stock looks like a solid bet for retirees. The dividend is well covered by earnings, with a payout ratio of less than 25%, so the likelihood of a dividend cut is remote. It looks like there's far more upside than downside to me. Riding a long-term trend Cory Renauer (DaVita Inc.): It's fitting that one of the best Buffett stocks for retirees belongs to a company that derives a great deal of its business from retirees. About 39% of U.S. dialysis patients are over 65 years old, and each day about 10,000 baby boomers enter this fast-growing demographic. Longer life spans and increasingly prevalent chronic conditions that come with age make dialysis treatment a growth industry. Chronic kidney disease now affects about 14% of the general population, and diabetes and high blood pressure are the main cause behind about half of all reported cases.  A growing patient base isn't the only long-term trend providing a tailwind for DaVita and its dialysis-providing peers, as downward-trending mortality rates are lengthening treatment durations across the board. These trends have helped the company report annual revenue growth in each of the past ten years, from $5.3 billion in 2007 to $14.7 billion last year. Although DaVita doesn't offer a dividend, it has been returning profits to shareholders in the form of stock buybacks that have lowered the number of shares outstanding by about 9.7% over the past two years. With a commitment to increasing shareholder value, and strong tailwinds pushing it forward, this is one Buffett stock retirees will want in their long-term portfolios.

Despite the vast capabilities of the Alexa-powered Amazon Echo speaker, it's been missing one simple skill that Apple's Siri can easily handle: the ability to make calls and send messages. That all changes with the upcoming Alexa calling and messaging feature, which will let you ask Alexa to call or send a message to anyone with a supported Echo device or the Alexa App for free. Like Apple's iMessage, the feature uses an internet connection instead of the minutes or texts included in your cell or home phone plan. There are three main options for calls: voice, video, and "Drop In." Thanks to the newly unveiled Echo Show (pictured), which sports a 7-inch touch screen and a 5-megapixel front-facing camera, Amazon predicts that people will use video calling in the "vast majority of cases." But if one of the parties has a regular Echo or Echo Dot, you can use voice calling instead. Voice calls also work with non-Echo devices, too, thanks to compatibility with the Amazon Alexa iOS and Android app. Drop In, meanwhile, is a way to connect instantly with the recipient of the call. If you give someone Drop In permission, he or she can start a voice call to your Echo device without any action on your part. Amazon envisions that people will use Drop In as a kind of intercom: to check on elderly relatives, monitor sleeping babies, or announce that dinner's ready. Related The Best Amazon Alexa Skills The Best Amazon Alexa Skills According to Amazon's product page, Alexa voice calling and messaging is "coming soon." The company didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on the availability timeframe, although TechCrunch reports that it will be enabled later today. An imminent launch would be an added incentive for people eyeing the new Echo Show, a $229.99 Alexa-powered device designed for video calls. It's now available for pre-orders and expected to arrive on June 28. UPDATE 5/9: Amazon confirmed that calling and messaging is now available on Echo and Echo Dot devices and the Alexa iOS app, and it will roll out to Android devices on Wednesday.

May 8 I Got Rejected by Apple Music… So I Redesigned It I’d like to preface this case study by stating that my intentions behind redesigning Apple Music were in no way driven by indignation or spite. Earlier this year I applied and interviewed for a graphic design internship at Apple Music (an opportunity of a lifetime), and was turned down with a very kind letter stating that although they liked my work, they wanted to see more growth and training. At first, I was frustrated — Northwestern University doesn’t offer any sort of undergraduate graphic design program, so whatever growth they were looking for would have to be self taught… …but as soon as I came to this realization, I became inspired to embark on what became a a three-month long journey to the holy grail — the iOS app that Apple Music deserves. For me, this was an opportunity to really dig my teeth into UX research and design, an excuse to spend way too much time on Sketch and Principle, a reason to bore everyone around me with my notebook of crudely drawn wireframes 😂… What you’ll find below is a case study offering potential solutions to address some of Apple Music’s problems, as well as ideas for future development. My process was guided by qualitative user research, Apple’s official Design Principles, and my own designer intuition. Introduction As a designer with a background in music composition and performance, I have always been passionate about experiences that marry music and technology. Through design, I hope to one day make the experience of music more accessible and enjoyable. However, Apple Music has always frustrated me. What was meant to be the service to convert everyone in the world to streaming is going through puberty — a phrase which here means steadily maturing yet unattractive compared to the adults in the game (aka Spotify). To better understand Apple Music, I took a trip down memory lane and revisited its inception. Plagued with a notoriously confusing interface and a half-baked visual identity, Apple Music’s first identity was the culprit of many headaches. Thank you, Lana Del Rey and Wayback Machine With iOS10, Apple released a much-needed update based on the principles of Complexion Reduction. Peep that incredible Pentatonix artwork by my dear friend and mentor Annie Stoll While this new interface was much easier to navigate, I still felt that there was room for improvement. Despite its simplified color palette and enlarged typography, the interface felt cluttered and even claustrophobic — a far cry from Apple’s usual elegance. I approached my redesign in three steps, while conducting research throughout: Core Experience Brand Identity Visual Interface 1. Core Experience: Music Discovery One of the first things that I found out was that users of streaming services generally fell somewhere on the following spectrum: Tag yourself; I’m the ambiguous greige area Hoarders: Have a large library that they add to from time to time Are more selective about what they listen to Nomads: Rely on playlists/curated content Are probably already using Spotify Apple Music sits at the Hoarder side of the spectrum. Open an Apple Music playlist and you’ll probably find this in the description: If you hear something you like, add it to your library. Treating playlists as tools to discover new music is an approach that makes sense given Apple Music’s pastlife as iTunes. However, the way that playlists are currently implemented feels very tacked on. I found that users weren’t comfortable with adding entire playlists to their personal libraries, especially if said playlists were constantly updating. If Apple Music wants to expand to the nomadic side of the spectrum, they have to do it in a way that brings their existing user base along. This means creating a music discovery experience centered on artists and albums instead of playlists. Enter… My Sampler My Sampler My Sampler is a new experience made to bridge the gap between Hoarders and Nomads, replacing the current “New Music Mix.” It was born out of the understanding that users who are picky about what goes into their library would also be more reluctant to sit through an entire playlist full of new music. A better experience would be presenting snippets — or samples — of curations that gives the user just enough information to decide whether or not to add it into their library and weekly playlist. Upon entering the Sampler, the user is presented with a series of artist headshots that correspond to a curated song. The user can tap and hold to preview 15 seconds of each song, before swiping up to reject the song or swiping down to add the song to their library. Music for the Tinder generation I chose to use gestural interaction so that users can use the Sampler even if they’re not looking at the screen. Once the user has finished sampling, their selections are used to create a New Music Mix that the user can listen to. The mechanics behind this experience was inspired by the following quote captured in an interview: “Apple is underestimating the power of gamification.” — UX designer and Apple Music user I interviewed in LA I have come to understand that, through a gamified experience, the user is able to establish an immediate connection to the music they discover. In addition, the Sampler has the potential to provide Apple Music a constant stream of information regarding listener preferences, allowing the app to evolve and grow with the user. 2. Brand Identity During my internship at Sony Music, I learned that a brand’s visual presence in a streaming service must be recognizable yet invisible at the same time. Spotify does this very well in their use of halftone photography and “Bursts” in their playlist album artwork. In comparison, Apple Music’s visual branding has right now is kind of all over the place: There’s a mix of symbols, 3D typography, and black & white photography. In addition, there are collage-themed covers that don’t really communicate anything about the mood/feel of the playlist. … The main issue seems to be Apple Music throwing everything at the wall to see what sticks, instead of really developing a consistent visual language that signifies Apple’s presence in the app amongst a sea of album artwork. My solution was built on the following principle: Album Artwork should be treated as part of the UI, and not a stand-alone visual component. Artist Spotlight Artwork: Inspired by Apple Music’s Welcome Screen, I chose to showcase artist headshots within a circular motif. The circle shape was inspired by the iPod clickwheel — an iconic part of Apple’s music legacy. The “face inside a circle” motif is also seen other aspects of iOS, most notably Contacts. In addition, I chose San Francisco so that the Artist Spotlight artwork would harmonize with the UI. Lastly, I limited the color palette to different shades/tones of blue, violet, and red to reflect the Apple Music Icon. Artist Spotlights Curated Playlist Artwork: For Curated Playlists, I wanted the look to be consistent with Artist Spotlights while showcasing an aspect of the playlist’s mood/vibe through use of color. More vibrant images are displayed against a backdrop of the same image with a gaussian blur filter (inspired by iOS’s background blurs). For certain covers, I also added a subtle gradient of Apple Music’s signature red to add a sense of dimension. Curated Playlists Core Playlist Artwork: Finally, I updated the centered graphics for some of the core playlists with the same typography used for the Artist Spotlights and Curations. Core Playlists I think this new branding scheme harmonizes well with the rest of the UI, and am curious to see if this circular motif could also be somehow animated upon user input… 3. Visual Interface General Improvements The chief complaint I heard about the current interface was that it felt too sterile and lacked an element of delight. To begin resolving this, I optimized white space through subtle app-wide adjustments as demonstrated below: Above: shameless advertising for EXID Library I didn’t think major alterations to the Library tab were necessary, so I limited the changes to the standard white space and typesize adjustments. I removed Downloaded Music as a default menu option because I think the app should self-adjust what music the user is able to access based on the availability of LTE/WiFi. Below are some subtle animation details (present in all tabs) I added to make the app feel less sterile. The round corners of the app already make it look bouncy, why not make it feel bouncy as well? For You “For You” is the beating heart of Apple Music. It’s where Apple Music gets to flex how much it knows about the user by curating playlists and albums based on what the user has “Loved.” I received a ton of feedback on how random the current “For You” felt, so for my redesign I aimed to reduce the amount of content thrown at the user while increasing the relevance of whatever’s left… like Facebook and Instagram’s “Top Posts.” The redesigned “For You” begins with “My Sampler” in lieu of the current “My Favorites Mix” and “My New Music Mix”. “Recently Played” is kept intact, as users found it to be quite useful. Scrolling down, you’ll find that I’ve changed the “Insert Day of the Week Here — Playlists” to a specific Mood that will adjust based on location, time, and recent social media activity. Wouldn’t it be awesome if, immediately after checking into a café on Facebook, Apple Music updates this Mood section to Focus/Study playlists? If we’re sharing our entire lives on social media anyway, might as well get something out of it, you feel? Below that is the Daily Stream, an example of how exclusive video content can be pushed to the user based on their preferences. For example, I really like Katy Perry, so if a Katy Perry episode of Carpool Karaoke is released, the Call-To-Action can be changed to place the emphasis on Katy’s appearance. This hasn’t technically been released yet but please let this be true. Afterwards, you’ll find the classic Artist Spotlights, which I kept in this demo to show how the new visual branding schemes works in harmony with the rest of the UI. And last but not least, users get a preview of their most-loved/played genres so that they have quick access to more music if nothing in the For You feed was able to pique their interest. I couldn’t think of a good instrument for Pop, hence the bubble gum But whatever happened to Connect? Good question. Truth is, I didn’t see any data from my research that would justify keeping the Connect feed in the app as is. Users were more interested in connecting with friends and family through music (a la Spotify) instead of with artists through a watered-down Twitter. I think Apple should focus on integrating existing social media with Apple Music instead of trying to push yet another one on its already overburdened consumers. Image credit to Paramount Pictures/Mean Girls Browse The majority of feedback I received regarding the current Browse screen was that it felt too sterile and uninviting. Some users also expressed confusion regarding the differences between “For You” and “Browse.” My solution was to redesign the Feature Slides in the style of Apple’s Website — Jumbo slides that fill the viewport width, with a horizontal indicator of where the user is in the slideshow. I believe this change makes Featured content feel more inviting and less intrusive/random. I also merged the Radio menu into the existing Browse menu. This conveniently makes room for the Watch tab… Watch Earlier this year, Apple confirmed that Apple Music was expanding into video streaming content in an effort to turn Apple Music into a pop-culture central. I was curious how this will play out especially in the context of the mobile app, so I created a separate tab specifically for browsing exclusive video content and music videos. An added bonus of dedicating a tab to Video is that “Browse” can be reserved exclusively for audio content. There will eventually be enough content to justify a dedicated tab, but for now I based my design decisions on leaked information as well as Apple Music’s existing visual language. Search The main problem with how Apple Music handles search right now is that it is based on a mode system: where you can either search in Apple Music or your library — but not both. Two years into using this app, I still find myself getting frustrated at being in the wrong mode, especially since the Library mode handles keywords differently: This is especially annoying because there’s a high potential for input error, especially if the user is looking up a new song or artist not yet in their library. My solution was to merge the two mods into one general “search” that displays results from the user’s library first, followed by anything else that is available on Apple Music. Is it obvious that I’m a huge fan of Lady Gaga? Support for fuzzy keywords should extend to the user’s Library content. It will also be interesting to see if results for keywords relating to moods or activities can be implemented in the future. Now Playing I like what Apple has done with the Now Playing screen, and didn’t think any major adjustments were necessary. I decided to keep most of the visual interface as is. However, I thought a great way to build upon the existing experience would be to incorporate some simple gesture interactions. To many users, myself included, the necessity of “training” Apple Music through the “Love” and “Dislike” commands was unclear. This can be partially attributed to be how well said commands are hidden; the process of “loving” a song on mobile requires users to open a separate menu — a tedious process that trivializes its impact. “If they’re hidden so well, that must mean they’re not meant to be found, right?” My solution was to implement a gesture that most users are already familiar with — the double tap — into the Now Playing experience. I observed that many users tried to press the “floating” album art in the present release (it just looks so delightful)…why not add a response? Music for the Instagram generation In addition, I added sneak peeks of adjacent tracks that users can skip to through a horizontal swipe. I believe this will grant users more control over their listening experience in an intuitive way. Swipe right to party. What’s Next? Looking back at the initial scribbles I made on my notebook during my initial brainstorming sessions, I’m happily surprised at the amount of progress I was able to make in three months. Going into this process, I had no working knowledge of Principle and could barely edit blend modes in Sketch. Now…to be honest, I still consider myself a novice in said prototyping apps, but hey, I was able to make something happen — and that’s the best I could have hoped for. I don’t expect the good folks at Apple Music to take anything from this case study. In fact, I might actually have a heart attack if anyone working on Apple Music stumbles upon this article… but if you’re out there, I hope my work was able to give you some ideas and spark some conversations! Through this project, I have come to understand the value of my theatre background in relation to UX design — experience designers and theatre artists are alike in their shared understanding of human empathy. Take that, literally everyone who rolls their eyes at my resume! Soon, I will be embarking on my next great adventure: BFA Graphic Design at Rhode Island School of Design. Although it feels strange to say goodbye to this process (and to Northwestern University), I sincerely hope that this is just the beginning of a career in experience design… a career of changing the world through empathy.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Apps & Software Image Source: Shutterstock Apple sends out official invites for WWDC 2017 Yoni Heisler @edibleapple May 9th, 2017 at 3:31 PM Share Tweet We already knew the dates of Apple’s WWDC event this year, but Apple earlier today made it official when it sent out official invitations to the event. The festivities are slated to kick off on June 5 with a keynote scheduled to take place at 10 a.m. Pacific Time. Per usual, Apple’s WWDC event will provide developers and Apple enthusiasts with a peek at upcoming versions of iOS and macOS. The most interesting announcements will likely focus on iOS 11, with recent rumors suggesting that Apple will introduce an enhanced version of Siri, support for peer-to-peer Apple Pay based payments, support for 5-person video chatting via FaceTime, and more intelligent battery monitoring. Don't Miss: Google has a new OS that may one day kill Android, and this is your first look at it What may make this WWDC particularly interesting is that it might also see the introduction of new hardware. According to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple this year at WWDC might unveil its Siri-based Amazon Echo competitor, a device Apple has reportedly been working on for quite some time. iOS 11 aside, we can also expect to see Apple introduce updates to macOS, tvOS, and watchOS. Interestingly enough, prior WWDC events were shrouded with rumors of Apple unveiling its own streaming TV service. Such a service never materialized and there’s no indication that Apple will have any groundbreaking TV announcements to make next month. The craziest WWDC rumor we’ve seen claims that Apple might unveil the iPhone 8 at the event. Though this rumor emanated from a Deutsche Bank investor note, the idea that Apple would introduce new iPhone hardware in early June ahead of a fall launch window seems beyond impossible. Venue wise, Apple’s upcoming WWDC event will not be taking place at Moscone Center, but rather at the McEnery Convention Center in San Jose, California.

This year's keynote will be held at the McEnery Convention Center in San Jose, California, which we learned when Apple announced WWDC back in February. Apple typically holds its big keynotes at the Moscone Center in San Francisco. The original WWDC invite to developers said "Technology alone is not enough. Technology must intersect with the liberal arts and the humanities, to create new ideas and experiences that push society forward. This summer we bring together thousands of brilliant minds representing many diverse perspectives, passions, and talents to help us change the world." It suggests, perhaps, that there needs to be a more human element to our technology. This could mean the obvious: that it wants to continue to meet with and cater to developers. Or maybe there's something deeper here. Does Apple have big plans to merge the real world and the digital? That could point to augmented reality, which Apple has said is important to its plans moving forward. Or perhaps we'll hear about a smarter version of Siri, one that lives on an Amazon Echo-like device. Apple's also expected to unveil its latest product software during the keynote, including iOS 11, the latest version of macOS, and updates to watchOS and tvOS. Apple sometimes uses the event to introduce new hardware, too. Rumors have suggested Apple is gearing up to launch a new 10.5-inch iPad, in addition to a refreshed iPad Pro and updated MacBook Pro computers.

Apple’s marketing chief recently talked up the benefits of having a screen on a voice-activated device, but “it’s unclear whether the Apple version will in fact have one,” said Bloomberg. Amazon’s $230 Echo Show, pictured below, streams music from Amazon’s own service, Spotify and Pandora, but not Apple Music. “We’d love to have Apple, but they’re not super big on opening up Apple Music integration,” said Amazon devices chief Dave Limp. Apple’s upcoming AI speaker is likely to feature native Apple Music integration. It’s not unusual for Apple to allow its employees to test unreleased products at home. The fact that the rumored Siri device is being tested with Apple employees indicates that the product is nearly finished and being prepared and bug-tested ahead of a rumored launch next month. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicted it would be powered by an iPhone 6s-class custom processor and a custom version of iOS, supporting features like Siri and AirPlay. “We expect Apple’s first home AI product will have excellent acoustics performance (one woofer and seven tweeters) and computing power similar to iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s application processor,” Kuo told clients. KGI believes there’s more than a 50 percent chance that Apple will announce its first home AI product at WWDC 2017 next month. It should start selling in the second half of 2017 and be priced higher than Amazon’s existing Echo appliances. Siri wireless speaker mockup via Twitter user “iFunnyVlogger”.

Apple in the Enterprise: A Strategic Guide Once a pariah in the enterprise, Apple has quietly emerged as a darling of executives and professionals because of the ease of use of the iPhone and the iPad. We look at how the influx of Apple devices is changing the tech landscape in business. Read More This year's conference was moved from San Francisco, Calif., to a location closer to Apple's campus to make it easier for Apple employees and engineers to attend and spend time with developers. In total, the conference will run from June 5 to June 9. Apple has traditionally used the event to unveil the next version of the company's operating systems. This year we should see iOS 11, macOS 12.13, watchOS 4, and an improved tvOS. Bloomberg previously reported iOS 11 would receive a refreshed user interface for the first time since 2013. Beyond new software updates and enhancements, recent reports have tipped WWDC as the stage where Apple will announce its Amazon Echo competitor. The Siri speaker, for lack of a better, will give users the ability to interact with the company's digital assistant, possibly with a built-in camera. Occasionally Apple has also used the WWDC stage to announce minor updates and refreshes to hardware products. Currently, the iPad Pro line is overdue for an update, for instance.

The documentary, aptly named Harry Styles: Behind the Album is a behind the scenes look at Styles’ first solo album. From the already released singles, the album will be a departure from the British boy band member’s earlier sounds. As Styles puts it, “I kind of wanted to see if I could write something that people liked without knowing everything about me.” Exclusive music documentaries are Apple Music’s forte at the moment. Early into the platform’s original launch, Taylor Swift’s 1989 World Tour had been an Apple Music exclusive release. The streaming service is ramping up exclusives into 2017 with new music documentaries and original content as well. Not only are music documentaries featuring Sean “Diddy” Combs and Kygo coming to Apple Music, but an unreleased Prince film is on the table as well. Apple has seemingly been more on top of its Apple Music exclusive video content that features musical artists, while its other original content has yet to be seen.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Lifestyle / Mobile / Apple / The FBI’s iPhone hack ended up costing $900,000 The FBI’s iPhone hack ended up costing $900,000 Matthew Wilson 12 hours ago Apple, Featured Tech News, Security One of the biggest stories of 2016 was the Apple V FBI encryption and privacy battle. At the time, the FBI wanted to force Apple into cracking an iPhone 5c used by a criminal but by doing so, Apple would be forced into creating a backdoor to its software, which could then compromise the security of all iPhone users. After plenty of legal back and forth, the FBI hired outside help to crack the iPhone and it certainly wasn’t a cheap endeavour. The FBI hired a firm known as Cellebrite to develop a tool to bypass iOS security. In all, this little venture ended up costing the US government over $900,000, a US Senator has now revealed to Associated Press. Previous estimations pinned the FBI’s total bill at around the $1.3 million mark. However, the FBI had refused to confirm or deny this number. However, during a Senate Judiciary Committee oversight hearing, Senator Feinstein brought up the FBI’s bill, saying: “I was so struck when San Bernardino happened and you made overtures to allow that device to be opened, and then the FBI had to spend $900,000 to hack it open”. While the FBI may have got its way by hacking into the iPhone 5c, eventually, Apple’s point was proven. Apple was initially against creating a backdoor to its OS as it could be discovered and exploited by just about anyone. This was proven when Cellebrite was hacked earlier this year, with the hacker making off with 900GB of data, including the tool used by the FBI to bypass iOS security. KitGuru Says: This whole Apple/FBI encryption battle has been so intriguing to witness. It has generated plenty of mixed opinions though. Do you guys think Apple should have helped break into the iPhone initially? Or do you agree that creating a backdoor would have been too dangerous?

The elderly committee chair’s argument about the need for government to be able to snoop through electronic communications with ease comes from her apparent shock that the FBI paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to a third-party hacker to gain access to an iPhone belonging to one of the San Bernardino shooters. “I was so struck when San Bernardino happened and you made overtures to allow that device to be opened, and then the FBI had to spend $900,000 to hack it open,” Feinstein said, according to the Associated Press. “And as I subsequently learned of some of the reason for it, there were good reasons to get into that device.” The government made the decision to bring in the hackers after ending a court battle with Apple. But as former Congressman Ron Paul noted last year, the government didn’t just begin wanting access to encrypted devices following the San Bernardino shooting. Paul wrote:  “[T]he truth is they had long sought a way to break Apple’s iPhone encryption and, like 9/11 and the PATRIOT Act, a mass murder provided just the pretext needed. After all, they say, if we are going to be protected from terrorism we have to give up a little of our privacy and liberty. Never mind that government spying on us has not prevented one terrorist attack.” The liberty advocate also pointed out: “[T]his new, more secure iPhone was developed partly in response to Ed Snowden’s revelations that the federal government was illegally spying on us.” And with Feinstein complaining that the government had to spend money to hack the shooter’s phone, it’s worth looking at what’s already being spent to violate American privacy. Over the next two years, according to the Electronic Privacy Information Center, the Trump administration wants to invest nearly $100 million in taxpayer funding to help the FBI and other intelligence agencies defeat encryption. Since 2011, the NSA has cost U.S. taxpayers around $75 billion. When the San Bernardino attack occurred in 2015, NSA was operating under a budget of about $10 billion. What does the agency do with all that money? Well, thanks to Snowden we know that it sweeps up all digital communications data in real time and scours it for signs of budding extremism. In other words, if the “good reasons to get into that device” Feinstein referenced included text messages and other communications to extremists involved in the San Bernardino attack, the NSA had them. The information would have made its way to the NSA’s $1.5 billion 1 million square-foot data center in Utah where it stores the data it collects in the surveillance dragnet. Why does all of this matter? Because Feinstein wants you to believe that the government needs to save $900,000 by making hacking easier—and that we’ll all be safer for it. That is a load of bullsh*t. The government missed the San Bernardino shooters, and numerous other real terrorists, because it’s too busy collecting information on millions of people who pose no threat to the nation. It is information overload— and people like Feinstein are telling us the smart thing to do would be to have more. I strongly urge you to read Bob Livingston’s 2015 piece, “San Bernardino terror attack lays bare the fraud of government,”  which exposes the massive fraud that the government surveillance state commits against American citizens every day.

Apple employees have been testing a device at home for several months, according to people familiar with the matter. While marketing chief Phil Schiller recently talked up the benefits of having a screen on a voice-activated device, it's not clear whether the Apple version will in fact have one. The news comes as Amazon releases its latest Alexa device, the Echo Show, and analysts are predicting that Apple could unveil a rival as early as WWDC. Notably, Apple SVP Phil Schiller recently hinted that its device could feature a screen as well. "So there's many moments where a voice assistant is really beneficial, but that doesn't mean you'd never want a screen. So the idea of not having a screen, I don't think suits many situations. For example if I'm looking for directions and I'm using Maps, Siri can tell me those directions by voice and that's really convenient but it's even better if I can see that map, and I can see what turns are coming up, and I can see where there is congestion, I understand better my route, and what I'm going to do."

Apple traditionally holds a keynote event on the first day of the Worldwide Developers Conference, where new software is introduced. We expect to see new versions of iOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS at the conference, and there's a chance we could also see new hardware like updated iMacs and Apple's rumored Siri speaker. As was announced in February, the Worldwide Developers Conference will take place from June 5 to June 9 in San Jose, California, a departure from past events that have long been held in San Francisco at the Moscone Center. Tickets, which were priced at $1,599, were distributed by random selection at the end of March, and free tickets provided to scholarship winners were also handed out in April. Apple expects to host about 5,000 developers, with hundreds of Apple engineers available to answer questions and host app development sessions. Developers who cannot attend will be able to watch the sessions through the WWDC 2017 website, and the WWDC app for iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV. For the June 5 keynote event, MacRumors will provide a live blog both here on MacRumors.com and on our MacRumorsLive Twitter account, along with detailed coverage of everything Apple announces during the week.

Not at all. I'm looking forward to seeing what the latest iOS/MacOS/WatchOS versions will debut. And what would predictability have anything to do with it? We already know Apple will demo the latest OS and it's primarily about the developers. Any hardware would be a bonus.

Apple Evan Selleck Contributing Editor | May 9, 2017 0 shares 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0               Loyalty is something a company like Apple, and Samsung, and LG, love to hear. They would very much like to have created something that you like so much that you decide you'll stick with that company when they release the next big thing. Apple wants you to upgrade from your iPhone 6s to an iPhone 7, Samsung wants you to pick up the Galaxy S8 after you're done with the Galaxy S7, and, well, LG would just like you to check out the G6 and stick around for what's next. I've used an iPhone for the last several years as my daily driver, but it took an article about China and smartphone consumers there to make me realize that it's not necessarily the iPhone itself that keeps me coming back, but rather the software that Apple has installed on it. iOS has kept me loyal to Apple. Not the iPhone. John Gruber has had a thought experiment for quite some time now, where he states he would much rather use iOS on an Android device like the Google Pixel, than have to use Android on an iPhone. I agree with him on this. I think Android has come a long way over the years, and I certainly don't think anyone who likes using Android over anything else is somehow wrong (they really aren't). I'm just the most comfortable in using iOS, and there are some features that I just prefer using. A comfortable routine with iOS keeps me buying iPhones and using them as my daily driver, while I pick up Android phones to play around with, test out, review, and see what Apple could do better in certain areas. For example, while I love the camera on the iPhone 7 Plus, there's no denying that Google's software makes the camera in the Pixel and Pixel XL better, especially in low light. I don't have any doubts that Apple will improve the camera in the iPhone 8 at least (the iPhone 7s/7s Plus though...), but now there's a definitive bar they need to reach. The iPhone 5 was my favorite iPhone from a purely hardware perspective, but since then I've basically checked out when it comes to the design of a phone. LG and Samsung have spiced things up, thankfully, and even Xiaomi released a phone with no bezels (except on the bottom) last year that is certainly attention grabbing. The iPhone 8 may revitalize my love for the iPhone hardware, but I'm not holding my breath on that. But as long as Apple doesn't completely dismantle iOS and start "fixing things" that aren't broken, I'll probably still try to buy it. All I'm saying is that Apple better leave Control Center alone. What about you, though? If you're loyal to a smartphone company, whether it's Apple, or Samsung, or HTC, what keeps you coming back? Is it the hardware of the phone you're using, or the software that you use every day? Or maybe it's both? Let me know!

Its successor, iOS 10.3.2, is currently in beta and it will likely be another small release aimed at fixing bugs and improving security on the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. Apple hasn’t confirmed an iOS 10.3.2 release date for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch but with each passing day, the release gets closer. The company is currently on fifth iOS 10.3.2 beta for developers and the general public. With the iOS 10.3.2 release date imminent, we want to share some tips that could help make the transition from iOS 10.3.1 to iOS 10.3.2 a little easier for you and your device. iOS 10.3.2 Release Time The iOS 10.3.2 update is shaping up to be a small release with under-the-hood improvements and security patches. That could change as the beta progresses but we’re expecting it to be a maintenance release. It’s not as exciting as iOS 10.3 but iOS 10.3.2 could be an important update for your device, particularly if you’re struggling with iOS problems. And while you might be tempted to check your phone every 15 minutes for the iOS 10.3.2 update, that’s not how Apple iOS releases work. It’s difficult to predict the exact iOS 10.3.2 release date (though we do expect it to arrive soon) but it’s very easy to predict the iOS 10.3.2 release time. Here are a few things to keep in mind as we close in on the iOS 10.3.2 release date. Apple never releases iOS updates on the weekend so there’s no need to check for iOS 10.3.2 on Saturday or Sunday. iOS updates almost always arrive between 9AM and 10AM Pacific. General rule of thumb is to check around 10AM Pacific. This release time applies to iOS 10.3.2 beta releases as well. Betas typically come every 1-2 weeks, usually on Monday. While some of you will want to download the iOS 10.3.2 update the second it arrives, many others will want to wait. Don’t Try the iOS 10.3.2 Beta Unless You Really, Really Want To Given what’s on board (bugs and little else), the only people that should be trying the iOS 10.3.2 beta are those people who really, really want to help Apple squash problems, developers, and those who really, really want to test performance ahead of the official release. Most of you should avoid the early version of iOS 10.3.2, especially if you’re having an outstanding experience on your version of iOS. Be it iOS 10.3.1 or something older. Again, Apple could add some more meat to the iOS 10.3.2 update in the future but that would be surprising given that we’re now on the fifth iOS 10.3.2 beta. For more on the merits of the iOS 10.3.2 beta, take a look at our guide. Start Prepping Your iPhone, iPad or iPod It’s never too early to start preparing for an iOS update’s release. Here are a few pre-installation tips to keep in your back pocket as we approach the iOS 10.3.2 release date: Use this time to cleanup your device. Get rid of files (apps, music, etc), anything you no longer use. Cleaning up your device could improve your device’s performance. Start backing up your data. If you don’t know where to start, you’ll want to research iCloud backups, iTunes backups, and the differences between the two. If you want to download iOS 10.3.2 right when it comes out, make sure your device has at least a 50% charge (or you’re near a charger) around 10AM Pacific. Get your login information handy. Make sure you have the device’s passcode, Apple ID, and your important logins ready on release day. The update might log you out of various apps and services. Dig into feedback from iOS 10.3.2 beta testers. You might learn about a potential problem or benefit coming with your version of iOS 10.3.2. A little prep work will help you avoid major problems during the iOS 10.3.2 installation process. It’ll also help you avoid headaches once you get the new update on board your phone or tablet. Dig Into iOS 10.3 and iOS 10.3.1 If You Need To If you failed to download iOS 10.3 and you plan to skip Apple’s iOS 10.3.1 update, make sure you know what you’re getting into before you download the iOS 10.3.2 update on your phone. If you skipped iOS 10.3 and don’t have plans to download iOS 10.3.1 know that you’ll get the changes from those updates baked into your iOS 10.3.2 update. (Note: You’ll also get the features and fixes from any other iOS updates you missed.) If you plan on downloading iOS 10.3.2, you’ll want to get familiar with these changes ahead of the iOS 10.3.2 release. A new iCloud storage breakdown in iOS 10.3 shows you exactly how your using your space. We’ve put together a broad guide to the iOS 10.3.1 update. We’ve also put together a more in depth walkthrough that will take you step-by-step through the changes included in these updates. You’ll also want to get familiar with the new Clips application that arrived earlier this month. Again, you’ll need to download iOS 10.3.1/iOS 10.3.2 in order to use the Clips app on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch. Clips doesn’t support popular devices like the iPhone 5 or iPad 4. Prepare For & Report iOS 10.3.2 Problems If you choose to install iOS 10.3.2 on release day there’s a chance you’ll run into an issue during or after the installation process finishes up. If you do run into an iOS 10.3.2 problem on your phone, there’s no need to panic. Sometimes, it can take a couple of days for an update to settle in. If you notice weird battery life on release day, give it a day or two to even out. If problems persist after two days with iOS 10.3.2, or if the issues are serious, you’ll want to take action. There are tons of resources out there but our list of fixes for common iOS 10 problems is a great place to start. If you don’t consider yourself an expert, you’ll want to bookmark those fixes so you’re ready to tackle problems as soon as they popup. If you can’t fix your problem and/or you want to help the community, you’ll want to report iOS 10.3.2 problems as you see them. There are a few places to do that. You can relay your problem to Apple Support on Twitter and/or get in contact with Apple Support via the company’s website. We also recommend reporting your problem on Apple’s Discussion forums to alert Apple and other users to your issue. You Can Test iOS 10.3.2 Remember, if you don’t want to deal with the iOS 10.3.2 beta, you can still take the official version of iOS 10.3.2 for a test drive, provided you’re on iOS 10.3.1 when it arrives. For a short time, Apple will allow you to downgrade from iOS 10.3.2 to iOS 10.3.1. Apple is no longer signing off on iOS 10.2.1 or iOS 10.3 so you won’t be able to drop back to either of those. Most of you will probably choose to remain on iOS 10.3.2 but others might benefit from dropping down to the older version of iOS 10. It could help improve your device’s performance in key areas like battery life, connectivity, and speed. If you aren’t familiar with the iOS downgrade process, now is the time to get familiar with it. How to Get Off iOS 10.3.2 Beta If you chose to try the iOS 10.3.2 beta and you don’t want to get thrown onto the next iOS 10 beta, you’ll want to unenroll from the iOS 10.3.2 beta once the final version is released. Here’s how you’ll do that: Go to Settings > General > Profiles and then tap the iOS Beta Software Profile that appears on your device. Enter your passcode, if there is on associated with the device, and tap Delete Profile. You will no longer receive beta software. Go into your Settings or iTunes and download iOS 10.3.2. If you’ve been running an iOS 10.3.2 beta and the watchOS beta on your Apple Watch, you’ll need to take a few more steps before, on, or after the iOS 10.3.2 release date. Here’s how to get the watchOS beta off your device, Open the Apple Watch app on your iPhone. Tap the My Watch tab. Go to General > Profiles. Tap the beta profile you want to remove. Enter a passcode if needed and then tap Delete Profile. If you want to use iOS beta software again you’ll need to install the correct beta profile. iOS 10.3.2 Release & Time: 5 Things to Expect & 4 Not To iOS 10.3.2 Release Date   1 / 9 Apple rarely announces iOS release dates ahead of time so its silence regarding the iOS 10.3.2 release date hasn't been surprising.  It's difficult to predict an exact release date but the beta and Apple's tendencies can help us narrow it down a bit for you.  Apple is currently on iOS 10.3.2 beta 5 which means the company has released updates to beta testers. That's a lot for a small maintenance update like iOS 10.3.2 and it probably means we're getting close to the official roll out. The last maintenance update to go through a beta, iOS 10.2.1, saw four beta releases before it was released to the public.  Apple also tends to release new iOS software on Monday. This isn't guaranteed but the company's been pretty consistent with its iOS 10 updates.  At this point we'd be shocked if we made it out of May without a release. Look for iOS 10.3.2 to land on one of the remaining Mondays, May 15th or May 22nd. Monday May 29th is a national holiday in the United States and we don't expect Apple to release iOS 10.3.2 on Memorial Day.  We'd be very surprised if the iOS 10.3.2 beta stretched into June and the rumored arrival of iOS 11.   1 / 9 2 Responses 03/25/2017 James Burton Reply Hi I’m impressed with the amber alert system in the future is there going to be FBI warrants support 04/18/2017 Chile Reply DellLundg Slovakien NicholRan SherrillH Elfenbenskusten CaroleSch JacquieDe Schweiz ValorieHi BonnyMgrx Osterrike WindyChid OrvalGoul Nederlanderna MarthaSpa GabrieleC Everton SKKRalfgc GlendaXvr Spanien DakotaCam BrainBole Rumanien GeorginaE NoellaEll Valencia EstelleNe TerranceR Wales StaceyThe Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

They’re expensive and a bit heavy on the bass, but the Beats Solo 3’s 40-hour battery life is worth the price. While the Beats Solo 3 headphones sound pretty decent and have iPhone-specific features baked in, this product is overpriced at $299. Bluetooth headsets have been a hot topic ever since Apple killed off the iPhone’s headphone jack when it introduced the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. For years I’ve pretty much ignored Beats headphones, opting for and recommending Bose, Plantronics and Sennheiser headsets over the flashy Beats brand. That’s all changed after using the Beats Solo 3 headphones myself. While the Beats Solo 3 headphones aren’t the best value, I recommend this product to people with multiple Apple devices, so long as they don’t mind spending a little extra money for convenience. Beats Solo 3 Review Pros Superb Battery Life Easy Setup for iPhone, iPad and Mac Users Easy to Find Deeply Discounted Compact Design Cons Plastic Feels Cheap Overpriced at Full MSRP of $299 Sound Quality Good, Not Great Android Users Miss Out on Best Features Love and Hate for The Beats Solo 3 Love how great these headphones work with Apple devices and that they live up to the 40 hr battery promise, but the $299 sticker price is just too high. They are a decent value when discounted Buy Beats Solo3 Headphones Buy at Amazon Beats Solo 3 Headphones in Gloss Black ￼ The Beats Solo 3 headphones look nearly identical to the Beats Solo 2 headphones. The older headphones last for just 12 hours on a single charge, less than a third of the new model. That’s because the new Beats Solo 3 packs Apple’s W1 wireless chip. That’s the same chip found inside of Apple’s AirPod in-ear headphones. Apple owns Beats, which means Beats will likely be the only brand of premium headphones to feature the W1 chip and the incredible battery life it affords. Beats Solo 3 Value The Popular Bose QC 35 Next to the Beats Solo 3 I really enjoy my Bose QuietComfort 35 headphones, but they are just a little too big to carry without thinking twice about where to put them. The news that the Beat Solo 3 headphones would have 40 hours of playback time between charges really caught my attention. I also wanted a headset that was more compact. What I couldn’t do was justify $299 for the Beats Solo 3, which do not have active noise cancellation. Thankfully, Amazon.com chopped the price to $219 in a recent sale, making them a little more palatable to take the leap and buy my first set of Beats headphones. That’s still a lot of money to spend on headphones, but I feel like I’m getting my money’s worth since I’m actually using them quite a bit more than my Bose headphones on the go. Spending $299 on a pair of headphones is a pretty serious investment and people generally only want to make one such purchase. If you’re a frequent traveller, you may be better suited with noise-cancelling headphones like the Bose QuietComfort 35 headphones, which retail for $349. Beats By Dre headphones are loud in more than one way. Dr. Dre and company have long marketed Beats headphones with a combination of flashy ads, celebrity endorsements and placing the products in music videos. Many Beats headphones come in attention-grabbing color combinations. I prefer more reserved headphones and don’t like flashing giant logos when I’m out in public. ￼ I opted for the black-on-black Beats Solo 3, which is about as reserved as it gets. The logos are nearly invisible, which helps me feel less like a wannabe hip-hop artist when I wear them. The black finish is glossy and attracts fingerprints. Bose does offer a matte-black, which probably would have been a better choice. The Beats Solo 3 headphones are built almost entirely of plastic. While the design is modern enough, the plastic finish doesn’t exactly shout premium headset and just feels cheap when I’m putting them on or folding them up.  ￼ The headphones fold up into a pretty small package that can easily fits in my coat pocket or laptop bag. One thing to note is that there aren’t a bunch of visible controls on the Beats Solo 3 like there are on other popular premium headsets. There’s just a button to power button on the right ear cup. On the left ear cup the volume up and down buttons are hidden in the black circle around the Beats logo. The logo itself serves as a multifunction button that can be used to pause music, skip tracks, answer calls, and activate Siri. Beats Solo 3 Review: Setup, Sound and Battery Performance Pairing Bluetooth devices, such as wireless headphones, can be a pain for some people. To setup the Beats Solo 3, you don’t have to navigate through iOS settings or MacOS system preferences. Instead, you simply turn on the headphones and a prompt appears on your Apple device’s display asking if you’d like to connect to the Beats Solo 3. Once you click ‘yes,’ the headphones are essentially paired to all of your other Apple devices. If you’re expecting absolutely awesome audio out of these headphones you may be disappointed. While they sound pretty good compared to most cheaper headphones, I still prefer the overall sound quality of the Bose QC35 and other premium over-the-ear headphones. The Beats Solo 3 are not designed to wrap around your ears, which means you will hear ambient noise. One area the Beats Solo 3 crushes the competition is in battery life. I’ve been using the Beats Solo 3 headphones with my iPhone 7 Plus, iPad Pro and MacBook Pro since I bought them and have gone as long as two weeks between charging them. While I haven’t tracked exactly how many hours I’ve used them between charges, they definitely last more than the 40 hours per charge advertised. One afternoon I was listening to music for two hours while working and the battery level dropped just three percent. A feature called Fast Fuel allows the Beats Solo 3 headphone batteries to charge enough for three hours of playback in just five minutes. On a recent trip to New York, my son asked to use the Beats Solo 3 headphones with his iPad mini. They weren’t charged, so I plugged them into a portable battery before takeoff. Once we were at a cruising altitude, I gave him the headphones and the iPad and he was set for the rest of the five-hour flight. While you won’t need to charge the Beats Solo 3 headphones often, you’ll need to use a micro USB cable to do so. That’s not something most iPhone users have at the ready. It would make a lot of sense for a headset tailored specifically for iPhone users to charge via Lightning connector. The Beats Solo 3 headphones come with an audio cable that can be used with MacBooks, iPads and iPhones with standard headphone jacks. You can also use these headphones with the iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus if you’re willing to use an adapter. The cable has volume controls and an additional control button that can activate Siri. Android users should avoid the Beats Solo 3 headphones since so many of the features are Apple specific. If you’re an audiophile or an aspiring audiophile, you probably want to steer clear of the Beats Solo 3.  Most people will be more than pleased by how crisp their music sounds, especially if they’re listening in relatively quiet environments. If the Beats Solo 3 headphones sound like something you’re looking for, I suggest waiting to buy until you can find them below the $299 MSRP. Apple surely has big margins on Beats headphones and you’re overpaying if you buy these at full retail price. Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Hardware Image Source: Apple Bloomberg dishes new details on Apple’s unreleased Siri speaker Yoni Heisler @edibleapple May 9th, 2017 at 1:22 PM Share Tweet A few years ago, the smart speaker market was essentially non-existent. These days, with Amazon’s Echo lineup leading the charge, competition in the smart speaker space is becoming incredibly fierce. Not only does Google have an Echo competitor dubbed Google Home, but rumor has it that Apple is planning to roll out an Echo competitor of its own later this year. While nothing is set in stone just yet, reputable Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo — who has the best track record in the business with respect to Apple rumors — recently said that Apple may introduce its Siri-based Echo rival in just three weeks at WWDC. Don't Miss: Google has a new OS that may one day kill Android, and this is your first look at it Recently, Apple executive Phil Schiller effectively said that he finds current smart speakers uninspiring because they don’t have a display, strongly suggesting that Apple’s own Siri-based hardware would be differeint. Interestingly enough, Amazon earlier today rendered Schiller’s comments moot when it introduced a new Echo device with a touchscreen that it calls the the Echo Show. In the wake of Amazon introducing the Echo Show, Bloomberg relays that the Echo Show will allow users to play music from a number of streaming services, including Spotify and Pandora. Conspicuously absent, however, is support for Apple Music, an omission that not surprisingly has more to do with Apple than with Amazon. To this point, Amazon’s Dave Limp said that while Amazon would love to feature streaming support for Apple Music, Apple — at least for now — isn’t interested in opening up its music service to third-parties. That said, we can only hope that Apple Music’s absence from all things Echo is only temporary, especially amid reports that Apple and Amazon finally reached a deal to bring Amazon Video to Apple TV. Still, if Apple is going head to head with Amazon in the smart speaker space, Apple may reasonably opt to keep Apple Music off of competing devices. Another interesting tidbit is that Apple’s Siri-based Echo competitor may not necessarily feature a display. While Schiller seemed to suggest that a smart speaker without a display is nothing worth getting excited about, Bloomberg notes that it’s not yet a guarantee. Apple employees have been testing a device at home for several months, according to people familiar with the matter. While marketing chief Phil Schiller recently talked up the benefits of having a screen on a voice-activated device, it’s not clear whether the Apple version will in fact have one. With WWDC now less than a month away, the good news is that we presumably won’t have to wait too long to see what Apple has in store for us.

But he was adamant that he didn't want her taking care of him. "A spouse should be your spouse. Your lover and your friend. Not a free caregiver," said Stabelfeldt, 38. Stabelfeldt is a complete quadriplegic with no movement below his shoulders, but he takes every opportunity he can to find independence — including in his marriage to Karen, 48.

"Even though in certain areas, at least physically speaking, you can't really move much," he said. Stabelfeldt's cousin accidentally shot him in the jaw when he was eight years old, severing his spinal cord. "It's funny after 30 years, you still want to cry when you talk about getting shot," he said with a sigh. But he doesn't spend time feeling sorry for himself. In fact, he spends most of his time running his IT consulting business from his home office, helping his wife around the house when she's not at work, and building his charity, the TSF Foundation, to help other people in wheelchairs. And it's all thanks to new smart home and assistive technology like Apple's "HomeKit." A Smarter Home While advances in personal technology continue at a rapid pace, at times their designers seem to forget about the population that could perhaps benefit from it the most. Stabelfeldt says just the ability to charge a phone with a wheelchair didn't even exist until a few years ago. But features like Apple's "Home" app allow Stabelfeldt to control a variety of smart accessories in his house — from door locks and window shades, to lights and his garage door. The best part for Stabelfeldt? He can command Apple's intelligent digital assistant Siri to work it all. Todd Stabelfeldt is a quadriplegic with no movement below his shoulders, but he takes every opportunity he can to find independence — including in his marriage to Karen, 48. Chiara Sottile "I use voice recognition on my iPhone, pretty much every day all day," he said, noting he sends more than 100 texts a day and averages a phone call every six minutes. Using external switches and voice command, Stabelfeldt can navigate his phone and control his smart home from his wheelchair. Apple's "Switch Control" allows Stabelfeldt and people with limited mobility to navigate sequentially through items on a device's screen using Bluetooth-enabled switch hardware — controllable by the mouth, for example. "Between Siri and Switch Control, I can use my phone just as good as anyone with 10 working fingers and hands," he said. A Game Changer "We put a lot of time and effort into making sure our products are as accessible as possible for all users," said Apple's Sarah Herrlinger. She has worked at Apple for nearly 14 years and is their Senior Manager of accessibility policy and initiatives. "For some people, doing something like turning on your lights or opening a blind or changing your thermostat might be seen as a convenience, but for others, that represents empowerment, and independence, and dignity," she told NBC News. Stabelfeldt calls this technology a game changer: "I never thought I'd have the opportunity to be in love. To be married. To have children. To have dogs." "You can be who you want to be. This technology just allows you to be you in your story. And that's pretty awesome," said quadriplegic Todd Stabelfeldt. Chiara Sottile Todd can use his iPhone to select different accessories in various rooms in his very smart home, which he calls the "Quadthedral" in his typical wry humor. He can even create customized "scenes" to trigger a sequence of connected devices to perform a task in tandem. "Hey Siri, arriving home," said Stabelfeldt, on a recent trip home from a ferry ride. "Home sweet automated home," cooed the familiar voice of Siri — perched next to the wheelchair's control screen. And with that, he can disarm his home's security alarm, open the garage door, and turn on lights. Stabelfeldt monitors his home security, can let a delivery person in or out, or open the door on demand. "When I'm cooking, I don't have to stop and do those functions. He can facilitate and do those," said wife Karen. "Technology has completely changed how Todd can operate and where he can function." "You can be an employer or an employee. You can be who you want to be and this technology just allows you to be you in your story. And that's pretty awesome," said Stabelfeldt. An Independent Love But it makes a difference in what might be considered small gestures, too. Before he could navigate his iPhone with voice control and Siri, it was Stabelfeldt's caregiver who used to receive his calls and text messages — even affectionate messages from Karen. The caregiver would then relay them to Todd. "We weren't in this romance just with us. We were sharing our romance with other people," he recalled. Now, the Stabelfeldts relish how they can take care of each other, with help from technology. Todd and Karen Stabelfeldt Chiara Sottile "[It] makes my heart swell, you know... there's just a certain sweetness that comes with being cared for," said Karen, leaning in towards her husband. "We appreciate each others' strengths. You know, we don't both have to be strong in the same area." Stabelfeldt says he is optimistic that the technology will continue to improve, adding more and more accessories to the devices he can connect into his smart home setup. He says he wishes all his smart accessories could be controlled with one app, since they can't all currently fall under the umbrella of Apple's Home app. "HomeKit and Switch Control and Siri have given me a lot of value and a lot of opportunities to demonstrate that I'm a quality man and I'm a man of integrity," Todd Stabelfeldt. "To get up every day and go to work: Everybody's valuable, everybody has worth, everybody should have the opportunity to demonstrate it."

Transit information may still be in the process of rolling out to all customers, but according to the iOS section of Apple's Singaporean website, and a feature availability list, transit directions are live in Singapore. Apple Maps now allows users to get directions for the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) system that spans across most of Singapore using the "Transport" tab within the app. Each MRT line is color-coded for simple navigation. Along with transit directions, Apple Maps in Singapore is also gaining points of interest, a feature designed to highlight notable buildings, parks, and other landmarks. Transit directions have been available since iOS 9 launched in 2015, and while availability was limited at launch, Apple has been slowly expanding transit information to various countries around the world. More than 10 countries now have access to transit directions, and the feature has also expanded to many locations in the United States. A full list of where Transit directions are available can be found on Apple's website.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: 4 Companies That Could Eat Fitbit's Lunch Fitbit could continue ceding market share to aggressive rivals like Xiaomi, Apple, Garmin, and Samsung. Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) May 9, 2017 at 12:26PM Once upon a time, Fitbit's (NYSE:FIT) main competitor in the fitness tracker market was Jawbone. But that market has become much more crowded over the past few years, and Fitbit is falling behind -- analysts expect its sales to fall 26% this year, compared to 17% growth last year. Its bottom line is expected to remain deep in the red for the next two years. Research firm IDC recently reported that Fitbit's global share of the wearables market plunged from 29% to 19.2% between the fourth quarters of 2015 and 2016, as its shipments fell 23% annually to 6.5 million units. That decline was attributed to its major rivals splitting up the rest of the wearables market. Let's check out the four most dangerous players on that list. Fitbit's Blaze. Image source: Fitbit. Xiaomi Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi's Mi Band, which offered similar features as the original Fitbit Flex for about $15, gained ground quickly in China and several other markets. Its successor, the Mi Band 2, added a heart rate tracker, a screen, and a 30-day battery life for just $25. Both devices are bargains compared to Fitbit's $100 Flex 2, which lasts just a few days on a single charge and lacks a screen and heart rate sensor. That's probably why Xiaomi's total shipments nearly doubled year-over-year to 5.2 million during the fourth quarter, and why its market share rose over six percentage points to 15.2%. It also explains why Fitbit's revenue in the Asia-Pacific region slumped 26% last year. Apple As Xiaomi lured away Fitbit's lower-end customers, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) won over its higher-end customers with the Apple Watch -- which offers many more apps and features than Fitbit's devices. IDC reports that Apple's market share fell from 14.1% to 13.6% between the fourth quarters of 2015 and 2016, but its total shipments rose 13% to 4.6 million units (due to the growing size of the overall market). The Apple Watch Series 2. Image source: Apple. That growth was mainly attributed to Apple's introduction of the Apple Watch Series 2 last September. The second-gen model added full water resistance, a GPS, a brighter screen, and a bigger battery. The device's growing app ecosystem also helps the device evolve for other purposes -- a strength which Fitbit still notably lacks. Fitbit tried to counter the Apple Watch with the Fitbit Blaze, but many reviewers mocked the device's blocky appearance and cheap build quality. Garmin Fitbit then thought it could carve out a niche between cheap fitness trackers and high-end smartwatches with "sports performance" devices like the Charge 2, but it ran straight into Garmin (NASDAQ:GRMN), which has been diversifying away from its fading automotive GPS business with fitness trackers at multiple price tiers -- ranging from its low-end Vivoactive fitness trackers to its high-end Fenix sport watches. Garmin's high-end Fenix sports watches. Image source: Garmin. Garmin's market share dipped from 7.6% to 6.2% during the fourth quarter, and its shipments slipped 4.5% to 2.1 million -- indicating that it faces the same pressures in the low-end and high-end markets as Fitbit. However, IDC reports that Garmin has been faring well with its "dedicated fitness audience" with its GPS-enabled trackers, and that many of its users "graduate from simpler fitness trackers to more sophisticated and expensive sport watches." That upmarket shift lifted Garmin's average selling price from $200 to $258 in the fourth quarter. Samsung Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) controlled just 5.6% of the wearables market during the fourth quarter, but that was still higher than its 4.7% share a year earlier. Its total shipments rose 38% to 1.9 million units during that period, thanks to the launches of its new Gear S3 Classic and Gear 3 Frontier smartwatches. Samsung's smartwatches are only compatible with its own smartphones, and many of its newer devices offer stand-alone LTE connectivity -- a feature which most other devices lack. These two factors clearly limit Samsung's overall market, but Samsung smartphone users might consider buying those devices -- or lower-end devices like the Gear Fit 2 -- for their fitness tracking needs. The key takeaway In addition to these four challengers, other smaller wearable makers -- which together account for the remaining 40% of the market -- could make life tough for Fitbit. Therefore, Fitbit investors should be wary of the stock's recent post-earnings bounce, since the company still clearly lacks a meaningful moat to fend off all these aggressive rivals.  Leo Sun has no position in any stocks mentioned.

"But they are good at execution." The innovation in the virtual assistant space, for example, is coming from Google and Amazon, not Apple, Isaacson said. He's surprised Apple hasn't moved it's virtual assistant Siri into the home. "I use both Amazon Alexa, and Google Home. ... Sometimes I let them compete," said Isaacson. The value of the virtual assistant model isn't just the hardware, but the potential for an ecosystem of apps, he said. Apple will likely release a home assistant device soon — possibly this summer — but Isaacson thinks it could be too late for the company to catch up in that space. Instead, Apple should look at other areas that are ripe for innovation. "You could have a great company — and Apple is a great company — without having really a next big thing, but it isn't in Apple's DNA to be that way," said Isaacson.

Apple Music will stream “Harry Styles: Behind the Album” next Monday. The film will go behind the scenes of Styles' first solo album. Read: ‘Carpool Karaoke: The Series’ Delayed Again: Apple Pushes Back Premiere Date To ‘Later This Year’ Apple Music shared the trailer for the documentary on YouTube: “The film features exclusive interviews and behind the scenes footage shot in Jamaica, Los Angeles and London during the making of the album and is complemented by Harry and his band performing songs from it for the first time at the world-famous Abbey Road Studios in London,” the description of the trailer said. Apple Music also shared the trailer in a tweet saying: “Moving forward.” Styles is “moving forward” with his career, and so is Apple with its original content. The company is pushing its way into video to boost Apple Music above other rival streaming services, including Spotify, Tidal and Pandora. Apple’s Upcoming Original Video Content The upcoming iOS 11 update this year is expected to come with a revamped Music App that better showcases Apple original video content. Apple is expected to release  as many as 10 original shows and documentaries by the end of 2017, including will.i.am’s Planet of the Apps and Carpool Karaoke. The company is also said to be working on documentaries about hip-hop labels Bad Boy Records and Cash Money Records and another about music impresario Clive Davis. In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Apple executive Jimmy Iovine said Apple Music "is nowhere near complete in my head," adding the service will “grow slowly” but will move deliberately. Read: iOS 11 Features: Update Will Push Original Video Content With Revamped Music App Iovine said he is focused on music-related video, including a possible sequel to R. Kelly’s Trapped in the Closet, a rap opera. He has discussed possible ideas with Brian Grazer, the producer of Fox’s Empire and Genius, and with director J.J. Abrams. Iovine has also met with Warner Bros. Television about creating a show based on the life of Dr. Dre. Apple Carpool Karaoke Delayed Again Meanwhile, Apple has delayed the premiere date of Carpool Karaoke: The Series — again. The show is Apple’s first original video series, inspired by The Late Late Show with James Corden segment. Apple was supposed to release the show in April but decided to push the launch to later this year, giving no reason for the delay. Apple reportedly bought rights to the segment last year. Apple released a trailer for the series in February featuring John Cena, Shaquille O’Neal, Ariana Grande, Seth MacFarlane, Alicia Keys, John Legend and other celebrities. The show is expected to pair musicians, sports stars and actors, as well as other famous personalities who go on road trips while singing their favorite songs.

The partnership allows Phytelligence to propagate and sell MAIA 1 trees, quickly increasing the amount of the highly desired EverCrisp™ apple in the market and getting more plant material into the hands of awaiting growers. With Phytelligence's proprietary MultiPHY™ technology, the company can quickly replenish the depleted MAIA 1 supply with virus clean, true-to-type plants ready for delivery in Spring of 2019. By partnering with Phytelligence, the Midwest Apple Improvement Association is able to quickly fill grower demand by utilizing the 10-40x multiplication rates made possible with the Phytelligence MultiPHY™ technology. The MultiPHY™ process gives growers, universities, grower associations and breeders the ability to rapidly gain access to the latest varieties, solving the variety shortage while also enabling them to generate a greater profit by quickly filling all grower requests while the demand is high. "We are thrilled that Phytelligence is helping meet unmet demand for the MAIA 1 trees," said Bill Dodd, President of the Midwest Apple Improvement Association. "With the technology available today, growers should receive the immediate benefit of new varieties. There is no reason for new varieties to be rationed due to legacy growing processes. To help growers remain competitive with the latest varieties we need to utilize every technical advantage to bring new and improved apples to consumers. Phytelligence is at the forefront of the latest agricultural technology and we're proud to partner with them." "We're at the very beginning stages of seeing widespread, rapid propagation of licensed and club varieties with our MultiPHY™ technology," said Phytelligence CEO, Ken Hunt. "We're solving a very real need to quickly supply growers with these high-demand varieties and only Phytelligence can produce the high volumes needed to meet the increasing demand. With Phytelligence, there are no more industry "mix-ups" and our mortality rate is the lowest in the market. Our growers get vigorous, true-to-type plants with full root systems that grow aggressively when planted." Most desirable EverCrisp™ apple characteristics include: -       Sweet flavor -       Texture and mouth feel similar to Honeycrisp -       Resembled Fuji in shape and coloring -       Better storability -       Greater apple density The trademarked MAIA 1 variety is praised for its hardiness when grown in a diverse group of locations across the United State and in Europe, and the resulting apple has drawn Honeycrisp taste comparisons with its robust flavor profile. The variety is a cross between the Fuji and the Honeycrisp; melding the sweet, crisp texture of the Honeycrisp with the storability and outward appearance of a Fuji. Growers interested in sourcing MAIA 1 trees from Phytelligence should contact Paul Nelson at (509) 860-2400 or paulnelson@phytelligence.com.

Engst We’re approaching another of those inflection points where Apple leaves some apps — and their users — behind. When you launched an older 32-bit app in iOS 10, it first warned that the app might slow down your device. That was, as far as I could tell, not the case, but it was still disconcerting. With iOS 10.3, however, Apple went further, stating in no uncertain terms that the app would stop working with some future version of iOS. As to when that will be, there’s no telling, but iOS 11 would seem to be likely. The iPhone 5s was the first iPhone with a 64-bit processor, and since it shipped in September 2013, developers have had the option to have their apps run in 64-bit mode. Starting in 2015, Apple has required apps to run in 64-bit mode to receive App Store approval. The practical upshot of Apple’s iOS warnings is that most apps that haven’t been updated since 2015 will likely be rendered inoperable by whatever future version of iOS pulls the plug on 32-bit apps. I can’t imagine that there will be any way to keep running such apps, short of refusing to update to that version of iOS. In iOS 10.3, Apple made it possible to see which of your apps will be affected. Navigate to Settings > General > About > Applications. The number next to Applications is the total number of apps installed, but when you tap Applications to see what’s inside, you see a list of 32-bit apps that have no 64-bit updates available. Tap any app to see its listing in the App Store, from which you can tap through to the developer’s Web site and theoretically ask if there will be an update. In most cases, the answer will likely be no. To bring that question home to roost, what about the TidBITS News app? The answer is, you guessed it, no, we will not be updating it. Written by Matt Neuburg and last updated in January 2013 for iOS 6, the TidBITS News app simply isn’t used by many people, and most of those who are using it have updated to iOS 10. As you can see in the stats for April 2017, fewer than 50 people per day are using it. It should continue to work in current versions of iOS for now. At its heart, TidBITS News is just an RSS reader dedicated to TidBITS, so you can easily replace it with Apple’s built-in News app. To add TidBITS to your Favorites list in News, search for TidBITS in News and either tap the heart icon next to the appropriate search result, or tap the search result itself and then the heart icon in the upper right corner. From then on, just tap Favorites in the News toolbar and then the TidBITS tile to see all our articles. If you want to add an RSS feed to News but can’t find it with a search from within News, you can use Safari. Navigate to the Web site in question, tap the share icon, and then tap Open in News in the share sheet. Once you’re in News, tap the name at the top of the screen to go to the main article list, and tap the heart button there. Inscrutably, Apple’s News app isn’t available in countries other than the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia, but iMore claims that you can get it by changing your region in iOS to one of those countries. Just navigate to Settings > General > Language & Region > Region. The News app should appear on one of your home screens after that; if it doesn’t, try restarting your device. I can’t predict what the downsides of changing your region might be, but if you switch back to your actual country, the News app will likely disappear again. You can, of course, use any other RSS reader like Feedly or Reeder — click the RSS link in the upper left of our Web site for the URL. However, only logged-in TidBITS members get access to the full-text RSS feed for use in other apps.   Make friends and influence people by sponsoring TidBITS!

Your comment will appear after you follow a link in the one-time confirmation message we send to verify that you're a real person. The writing is on the wall for 32-bit iOS apps that haven’t seen updates in years — they will stop working in a future version of iOS. That includes the TidBITS News app that a few people still use. Happily, you can easily replace it with any RSS reader, including Apple’s built-in News app. Receive comments via RSS Add a comment James Atkinson  2017-05-05 11:04 I appear to be one of the 50 daily users and have appreciated having a one-stop shop for TidBits content. Thank you for stepping through the Apple News/RSS alternative, which I'll do today. Farewell, TidBits News app! Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 11:11 Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but Apple's News app should work just fine for you. Reply david cuddy   2017-05-05 13:17 Not if you're in Canada. The iOS News app still isn't available here. Probably because we don't have 'Fake News'. Oddly, the News widget does appear on my Today page, and the -1 Home page. But there's no way to control the sources of the news feeds it uses. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 13:22 Still? Sheesh... sorry about that. Reeder or Feedly should work in that case. Reply Frans Moquette  2017-05-05 18:41 I seem to be one of the 50 also, but also no Apple News app on my iPad. I'm in The Netherlands (aka Holland). I do have Newsify, will that work? Otherwise, back to reading with Safari? Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-08 11:40 iMore says you can get the Apple News app in Canada by changing your region to the United States, United Kingdom, or Australia. I don't have a feel for what the downsides of doing that would be. http://www.imore.com/how-get-apple-news-uk-australia-canada-and-more Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 19:06 I haven't used Newsify, but from what I see on their product page, yes, it should work. Just get the RSS feed URL from the RSS link in the upper left of our Web site (full text for TidBITS members). Safari's Reader view does a pretty good job too for individual articles. Reply Lewis Butler   2017-05-05 11:20 How it was explained to me is that iOS 10 doesn't load 32 bit libraries until it has to, so running a 32-bit app can easily slow down your entire device depending on how much memory you have and how much you switch apps. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 11:24 Could be, but in practice, I never noticed any change after running such an app on my iPhone 7. Perhaps it had sufficient RAM and CPU power to mask any slowdowns. Reply Martin Stoermer  2017-05-05 11:37 Quite a few paid apps on my phone are marked as being on this scrap heap. Some have new versions available with a new name for new $, which I'm a bit grumpy about. In the case of the free ones it's a bit bit annoying but meh. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 11:41 I totally understand and empathize with the irritation of needing to buy new apps, but you should lay that blame squarely at Apple's feet, since they created a situation where developers have no choice but to chase new sales instead of supporting loyal customers. If developers were allowed to charge for upgrades, there would be financial incentive to keep up with existing apps. Reply Frans Moquette  2017-05-05 19:01 I agree. With non-paid updates/upgrades Apple has done developers a big disservice. But not only developers, users also. When you have to switch to a new app, you cannot acces your data in the old app, unless the data is in a cloud storage or the developer has provided a way to transfer it. If the old app does not work anymore on the new OS, you would loose all your data if you were not able to transfer it before the app stopped working Not a great user experience I would think, for which only Apple is to blame. Reply Christopher Smith   2017-05-05 19:33 While I can certainly understand that developers wish they could charge for upgrades (and why it incentivizes improvements to apps), it seems to me that allowing one's app to languish into obsolescence will definitely inhibit future sales. Reply Frans Moquette  2017-05-06 05:19 I agree with that too. Thing is, all products follow an S-shaped growth curve. Older product will be in the top of that curve with little to no new sales. The effort needed to update an older product often does not warrant the revenue from new sales, if any. Reply JohnB (SciFiOne)   2017-05-05 13:43 I knew Glyder would stop working some day. Oh well. But it will be a while yet since I gave up and now only update software and hardware when I have to. Not as secure, but less expensive and so much easier (except that I make even more offline backups to be safe). Reply Anonymous  2017-05-05 14:55 What I would like to comment on is have an iPhone 4s iPad 4/128 both still running iOS 9.3.5. I have been reluctant to move the iPad to iOS 10, I keep erasing the software update (hanging in storage) because of the tricks Apple keeps trying to make me update the iPad 4. Since I have a fixed income and cannot see sense in a new iPhone 5s or 4SE that are 64bit and I haven't been won over with possibilities iOS 10, and without possible compatibility between devices. So this is what I am wondering? 1.What if I update one but not the other, anyone with insight or expertise foresee problems between iProducts? 2.This is in reference to the below info (under FYI), if I update the iPad to 10, I know I cannot go back is it worth it. Any help? 3.Since this is a sandbox world closing in, is it time to just freeze my technology now before it made useless by having to afford the latest and greatest Apple product (or Microsoft)every 2-5 years? Just an FYI: Also my two Mac Pros are is similar place one a 2006/8 2,1 I upgrade the hardware my self to an 8-core so I frozen myself to 10.9.5 world with (64on32) and the used 2010 5,1 model can run 10.11 or 10.12 which seem to iffy, with all the beta crashing of Sierra I had.. At least I can roll back to my macOS of choice 10.9.5 on a different boot drive of the Mac Pro 5,1. ~Barry Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 16:45 It's hard to make concrete recommendations without knowing all the details, but it sounds like it might make sense to keep iOS 9.3.5 on both your devices, particularly if that matches with your Mac Pros and the equivalent version of iTunes (honestly, I don't know what versions match up offhand). If you start upgrading things piecemeal, you will end up in a situation where something won't talk to something else, but it's hard to predict how that will happen. The main thing to be aware of is that you aren't getting security updates, so you should be extra careful to avoid dodgy parts of the Internet. At some point, some hardware will probably fail and force you to get something new, and that may be the event that encourages upgrading everything to the latest and greatest. Reply David Morrison   2017-05-05 22:14 There is definitely a problem with upgrading iDevices if you connect them to a Mac and the Mac is not running a very recent version of OS X. Basically, older versions of iTunes will not talk to newer versions of IOS. What you get is a dialogue every time you plug in the device telling you this and advising you to upgrade iTunes - very annoying, since newer versions of iTunes will not run on older versions of OS X! So say you are running OS X 10.8 with iTunes 12. Your iDevices are running IOS 9.3.5. This works fine. You then decide to upgrade to IOS 10 on a device. If you try to do it through iTunes, it will say you need to upgrade iTunes - this warning is pretty vague, and does not raise any alarms. Unfortunately, iTunes 12 is the last version that will run on OS X 10.8. So your only option is to upgrade OS X which may not be acceptable. So you upgrade the device to IOS 10 over the Internet directly. Then plug it in to your Mac and get a warning from iTunes that it cannot talk to the device. Oops! No more backups of your device. No copying data files from apps to your Mac. No managing apps on your Mac. What does work is that iPhoto will still transfer photos, and probably Image Capture too. Third party file access apps on the Mac can also access the device. It seems to just be iTunes that does not work. Beware also that if you buy a new iDevice, it will not work with iTunes on your old Mac either. Sadly there is definitely no going back after the upgrade. You are stuck with IOS 10.

Reply Anonymous  2017-05-08 12:30 Thank You, David, I thought that might the devices road I have seen from Apple in the past, glaring at me in the rearview mirror. Reply Derek Roff   2017-05-05 16:23 "The number next to Applications is the total number of apps installed, but when you tap Applications to see what’s inside, you see a list of 32-bit apps that have no updates available. " I'm not seeing exactly what you describe in the article, on my iPad 4 with iOS 10.3.1. When I tap on Applications, I see the number of apps (100), and "inside", I see the text you list about "These apps may slow down your iPad...". No app names appear directly below that. Then I see in grey text "Updates available". Below that are app names, including apps that I upgraded today. I haven't counted, but I think all 100 apps might appear in this group. This includes major apps like App Store, Remote, FaceTime, Google, YouTube, Amazon Prime Video, Dropbox, etc. It doesn't make sense to me that these are all 32-bit applications, but it's likely that some of the apps I have installed are. I haven't been able to guess the ordering system for this list. It isn't alphabetical. It isn't by age, install date, or most recent update. Tapping an arrow next to most apps will take me to the App Store, and show me that no update is available. A few say that the app is not available in the App Store. Below the last app on this list is grey text saying "No Updates Available". There are no apps listed under these words. Can you give us a few more words about this app list, and how to interpret the groupings and ordering? Thanks. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 16:41 My best guess is that it's confused. :-) What I'd try is going to the App Store app, making sure that everything is updated, and then restart the iPhone (hold down both buttons until it restarts). Reply Derek Roff   2017-05-05 17:15 Thanks for your response, Adam. A restart changed nothing for me, and the App Store shows no updates available. I guess I will wait and see what happens with the next iOS upgrade. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 17:17 The other thing you could try is signing out in Settings > iTunes & App Stores. Then sign back in and see if it has figured things out better. Reply Timothy Pearson  2017-05-05 16:22 Reading TidBITS in Apple News doesn't work for me. Following your prescription, I added it to my favorites; but it only shows one article since 3 October 2016, and several unrelated articles about "Tidbits" from other sites. If the iOS app stops working, I guess I will have to use the webpage instead. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 16:47 It sounds like your search hit "Tidbits" as a topic, rather than "TidBITS" as the publication. Try again, and make sure the one you're selecting has our capitalization. Tap it, and make sure it's our content, then tap the heart icon at the top right. Reply brent  2017-05-05 18:18 thanks guys! guess i wasn't the only one to ask, lol. i liked the app, really just to catch specific articles i see noted in FB or tweets. but the apple news will do. irony, i had never used apple news until now. keep up the good work, you are still my "go to" resource. Reply Roland G  2017-05-05 19:28 I'm an iOS developer since 2009. I have updated many apps to support 64bit and it really isn't a big deal. The developers of these apps just need to update their apps to support both 32/64 and all is well. At some point Apple needs to move on with their OS and I fully support that. If you don't want to update to 11, don't update, simple as that. Reply Matt Neuburg   2017-05-09 13:07 It isn't that simple. Yes, the key step is simply to recompile with a 64-bit slice, which takes about two seconds. But TidBITS News is an iOS 6 app; it runs under iOS 10 only in a kind of emulation mode, where iOS 10 pretends to _be_ iOS 6. If you open the project with the latest Xcode in order to recompile it and make it 64-bit, you are linking it against the iOS 10 SDK and both the code and the interface need to be completely updated. In effect, the whole app must be rewritten from scratch. With TidBITS News, that's not really very difficult, but you can surely understand why, for many apps, their developers would find this daunting. And if the app is free or does not sell significantly, what's their motivation? Reply David Morrison   2017-05-05 22:24 I use the app occasionally, when in waiting rooms or travelling, but generally prefer the weekly roundup that arrives by e-mail. That said, I prefer the app's layout to News. News just shows the first few lines of each article to give you an idea of what it is about. This is often not helpful. In the app, there is a paragraph summarising the article, which often meant you did not even have to read the article if it was not of interest - a huge time saver. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-06 18:49 Hmm, I see what you mean — Apple News doesn't provide our blurb, just the first few lines of the article. I don't think there's any way to do that in News with an RSS feed. It might be possible with Apple News Format, but that's a whole 'nother ball of development wax. :-) Reply David Morrison   2017-05-05 22:31 I am having trouble adding the member version of the RSS feed. I logged in with Safari and clicked on RSS feed. It asked me if I wanted to open it in News. I said yes, then it told me the story could not be found. Tidbits does not appear in the favourites list. Going back to repeat this process, when I click on RSS, I get a message from Safari: Cannot open page Safari cannot open the page because the address is invalid. Any ideas? Reply David Morrison   2017-05-05 22:35 I quit News, and started again. Safari asked if I wanted to open the link in News. I said Yes. It showed the list of headlines, then said: Story unavailable. This story is not available in News. Given that I had not touched a story, this is mystifying….. Reply David Morrison   2017-05-05 22:37 Even though Tidbits is not listed in Favourites, the Tidbits news items are still being shown….. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-06 18:35 Can you just add it from the search in News? That's generally easier and will give the same result. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-06 18:50 What's weird is that it's working for me in Safari with no problems. Are you logged into the TidBITS site when you start adding? That might make a difference.

The writing is on the wall for 32-bit iOS apps that haven’t seen updates in years — they will stop working in a future version of iOS. That includes the TidBITS News app that a few people still use.

The well-leaked new Echo model includes a built-in display and camera so you can get visual responses to your Alexa queries and make video calls, too. The Echo Show offers the same Alexa voice controlled features as the Echo and Echo Dot, and adds a built-in display that shows content like weather updates, shopping lists, news videos, song lyrics when playing music. Amazon Echo Show adds a display to the Alexa experience Alexa Skills you’ve already set up work with Echo Show, so your smart home devices like lights, thermostats, and smart switches can be controlled from the device. It also shows video from compatible home monitoring cameras from Ring and Arlo. Amazon is touting Echo Show’s video phone capabilities that take advantage of its built-in camera. To get in on the video call action, at least one participant need a Show. The other can use an Echo Show or the Alexa app on their smart phone. The Echo Show seems a lot like the Siri voice controlled assistant Apple is rumored to be showing off at Worldwide Developer Conference in June. Apple’s device will reportedly include a touch sensitive display, high quality speakers, AirPlay and HomeKit support, and more. A leak from several days ago claimed Apple’s device will look like a shrunken Mac Pro cylinder, and a follow up report said odds are Apple will show it off at WWDC. While the cylinder shape does fit with the idea it’ll have a touch display, there is a consistent nugget in the reports about when we’ll get our first look at the device. Supply chain sources say Inventec has been contracted to make Apple’s device. Amazon’s Echo Show timing is likely a tactical move. Today’s announcement confirms the device is real, but you can’t get one yet. It’s available for preorder with a June 28th release date. That puts the announcement before WWDC when Apple may unveil its own Siri-based competitor, so anything Apple shows off will be compared to the already announced Echo Show. If you’re already invested in the Echo ecosystem, and think a display to go along with Alexa is the bomb, then the Show will be right up your alley. If not, then wait to see if Apple does unveil its own Siri assistant in June. Echo Show is available for pre-order on Amazon’s website for US$229.99.

The Senator accidentally spilled the beans during a Judiciary Committee meeting on accessing encrypted data on smartphones and personal computers. FBI’s San Bernardino iPhone hack cost $900,000 The $900,000 price tag, as well as the name of the company the FBI paid, was classified information—at least until Senator Feinstein shared the number while questioning FBI Director James Comey. She said, I was so struck when San Bernardino happened and you made overtures to allow that device to be opened, and then the FBI had to spend $900,000 to hack it open. And as I subsequently learned of some of the reason for it, there were good reasons to get into that device. The FBI Versus iPhone Encryption The phone she referred to had been issued to Farook by his employer, San Bernardino County. Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, opened fire on their coworkers during a holiday party in December 2015. They killed 14 people and injured 22 others. The two were killed later that day in a shootout with police. Law enforcement recovered the county-issued iPhone, but found Farook and Malik had destroyed their personal phones and computers. No one knew the passcode for the iPhone 5c in Farook’s possession, so the FBI turned to Apple for help. Apple was able to recover data from the iCloud account linked to the iPhone, but didn’t have any way to bypass the on-device encryption. When Apple hit the device passcode roadblock, the FBI obtained a court order compelling the company to make a version of iOS without the security measures that keep hackers out. The FBI said the hackable iOS version would be used only on Farook’s iPhone. Apple refused, kicking off a very public battle between the company and FBI over our security and our privacy rights. That fight ended abruptly only hours before a court hearing over whether or not Apple had to comply when the FBI said it found a way into the iPhone. FBI Director Comey said the agency paid an unnamed company for the hack, so Apple’s sell secure operating system wasn’t necessary for the case. He said the hack cost less than a million dollars, but wouldn’t elaborate on the actual cost or who the seller was. The evidence points strongly to Cellebrite as the seller, although the actual company name is still classified. The Cost for Hacking iPhones Now it seems we know just how much the FBI paid for its iPhone hack. Considering there wasn’t any useful information on the phone, just as law enforcement suspected, that dollar figure is about the only thing of value that’s come from the phone so far. Feinstein’s classified information slip up came as she was pushing to revive her bill requiring companies to create ways for law enforcement to access encrypted data on our personal devices. Director Comey is supporting her efforts saying it’s necessary to track down criminals and terrorists. He claims the FBI isn’t asking for a back door into our data, although it sounds like that’s exactly what he wants. Intentionally creating a way to bypass the encryption on our electronic devices is the very definition of a back door. The Senator’s bill fizzled out last year when it failed to gain real support. Hopefully that’s exactly what will happen again this year, too.

I don’t want the backdoor because the thieves will also use it, but I also want the phone examined when involved in criminal acts. I don’t know the answer, I am just saying there needs to be a balance. May 9, 2017 at 11:40 EDT AM vpndev May 9, 2017 “The Senator accidentally spilled the beans …” Do we know whether it was an accident or not? “The $900,000 price tag, as well as the name of the company the FBI paid, was classified information …” How do we know that it was “classified” ?? It was indeed private and unreleased but how do we know it was classified? These are not the same – not at all. May 9, 2017 at 2:00 EDT PM vpndev May 9, 2017 Lee: I hear you. But I don’t buy the oft-repeated “going dark” mantra with regard to phones. Police and the FBI have lots of ways of gathering information – many more than previously – and it is by no means clear to me that the “unlock any phone” requirement is wise or justified. Actually I believe that it is not. There is a balance between protection and access, as you say, and doing weak encryption or “golden keys” has been shown to be an easy path to serious compromise for all sorts of online activity. Banking and e-commerce don’t do well in a weak-security environment. Our collective task is to find the balance. Law enforcement keeps peddling the “sack of fear” for terrorism but the larger threat is to the business and commerce sector. Osama bin Laden pulled off a great victory by causing us to spend trillions of dollars on security stuff – at the cost of a million or so. Great ROI. Let’s not let their successors run the same scam. May 9, 2017 at 2:38 EDT PM Lee Dronick May 9, 2017 Yeah, they would want to unlock the phone for every traffic stop. Any smart terrorist cell is going to be compartmentalized and tough to trace, lone wolves are a problem. May 9, 2017 at 3:19 EDT PM Lee Dronick May 9, 2017 Osama bin Laden pulled off a great victory by causing us to spend trillions of dollars on security stuff An effective tactic, the Soviet Union broke up in part because we bankrupted them during the Cold War arms race. In the end we got Osama bin Laden, though that certainly didn’t stop terrorism and now Russia is once again a concern. May 9, 2017 at 3:56 EDT PM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

It’s not yet clear how long it will be taken away from New Yorkers and tourists alike who have flocked to check out the iconic cube over the years, but it will supposedly make a return when renovations on the underground Apple store are complete. By Josh Weiner via Gothamist Apple’s iconic glass cube on Fifth Avenue will be no more—well, at least for a little bit. The cube will be removed to allow renovation work to continue on the underground store as it preps for its expansion to 77,000 square feet of space, Crain’s has learned. Curbed was tipped off by BuildingZoom to plans filed by Boston Properties—the owner of the building in front of which the Apple Store is located. The plan calls for the “full removal of glass cubical structure at Apple store entrance,” according to the city’s Department of Buildings. The agency issued the permit for the work on April 17. In January, Apple temporarily moved to F.A.O. Schwarz’s former flagship store on Fifth Avenue to allow construction to get underway at their underground space. The glass cube will likely return once the expansion work is complete, but this has yet to be confirmed. Curbed’s request for a comment from Apple was unreturned, and the company declined to issue a comment to Crain’s as well.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 9 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman UPDATE – Ten Companies Lead in Responding to Radical Market Change and Reinventing Themselves for a Different Future, According to New Analysis of Public Company Data LEXINGTON, MA–(Marketwired – May 9, 2017) – As the pace of change accelerates in virtually every industry, a new study has identified the 10 global companies that have done the best job of remaking their businesses. The list — which includes celebrated tech innovators like Amazon and Netflix as well as standouts from industries that don’t as frequently make innovation headlines, including health care company DaVita and food and beverage giant Danone — offers insights into how market leaders can sustain growth even as disruption threatens their historically successful core business. The Transformation 10, a new report by growth strategy consulting firm Innosight, analyzed 1,000 companies and engaged a panel of business leaders to identify the 10 companies whose transformations had the biggest impact on their respective industries and the most potential to be sustained. The judges included former P&G CEO A.G. Lafley, former Boeing Defense CEO Chris Chadwick, and Columbia business professor Rita Gunther McGrath. Online retailer Amazon and entertainment firm Netflix were tied atop the rankings, followed (in order) by travel-technology company Priceline; global tech firm Apple; health insurer Aetna; software company Adobe; health care firm DaVita; computer and software maker Microsoft; food and beverage company Danone; and steel maker ThyssenKrupp. „A company survives and thrives over time based not on its size at any given time, but on its ability to adapt to disruption and to reposition itself to create a new future. We believe that by identifying companies that are transforming successfully, we can gain a better understanding of the dynamics and success factors of transformation,” notes Innosight managing partner Scott Anthony, who is the co-author of the just-released Dual Transformation: How to Reposition Today’s Business While Creating the Future (Harvard Business Review Press). Each company in the Transformation 10 found a way to create new growth while repositioning its traditional business: 1. Online retail giant Amazon developed technology to streamline internal operations, then turned it into a cloud computing platform that Amazon began selling to outside customers as large as the U.S. government. Since beginning what is now Amazon Web Services (AWS) in 2006, the new growth area now delivers about 10% of revenue, and accounted for more than half of Amazon’s operating profit in 2015. At the same time, Amazon has steadily fortified its core online retail business with new categories, including a growing library of music, movies and original programming. 2. Video entertainment company Netflix began shifting its business model to include on-demand streaming as well as traditional hard-copy DVD rentals in 2007. That core business of hard-copy rentals continues to exist, albeit in a diminished state. Meanwhile, Netflix’s domestic and international streaming business posted almost 90% of the firm’s revenue in 2015, and the company has been producing and commissioning its own content since 2013, another potential source of growth. 3. Travel-technology company Priceline was already the world leader in online travel in 2010, when it decided to provide a more complete service that included the „long tail” of travel suppliers beyond the major hotels (e.g., independent hotels, apartment buildings). To capture that new growth, Priceline acquired companies like Bookings.com and KAYAK, and the new growth business generated about 25% of revenue in 2015. Simultaneously, Priceline recalibrated its core business around helping customers plan a complete travel experience — much like an online concierge. 4. Beginning in 2007, computer giant Apple moved beyond its successful computer hardware business to create the world’s biggest ecosystem for digital content — and then to build on that ecosystem with new devices like the iPhone. Apple continues to be a manufacturer of computers, but the revenue from the firm’s digital networks and related products now accounts for 80% of the company. 5. Health insurer Aetna’s traditional model of selling health insurance through employers has grown nearly 80% over the last four years. Starting in 2010, the firm also began selling care management directly to consumers, and health care IT services to providers. Revenue from these newer, „value-based” contracts now accounts for about 40% of overall firm revenue. 6. Software company Adobe dominated the market for creating and designing documents and images, thanks to brands like Photoshop, Illustrator and Acrobat. But by 2008, fearing a saturated user base and a shift to cloud-based business models, the firm announced a new focus on digital marketing and analytics through a software as a service (SaaS) business model. The core business of packaged creative software lives on as the Creative Cloud subscription service, and new growth through digital marketing now creates almost half (45%) of overall revenue. 7. Health care firm DaVita specialized in kidney dialysis, making its money on a traditional fee-for-service business model and becoming one of the largest operators in its field. But starting in 2012, DaVita began building an „integrated delivery network” to deliver dialysis care as well as manage patients’ total healthcare. The core business — dialysis care — has nearly doubled over the last 10 years, while new growth now delivers 30% of total revenue. 8. Computer firm Microsoft continues to sell hardware and software; its legacy business offering still accounts for about half the company. But, starting in 2010, the firm made a bet on embracing cloud-based technology — while building up its hardware business. Its Intelligent Cloud business, which includes Azure and on-premises server software, reported 2016 revenue of more than $25 billion, almost a third (32%) of the company total. 9. French food and beverage firm Danone moved beyond its traditional yogurt business to grow a portfolio of health brands, including baby foods and other early life nutrition products. Those newer brands now generate 29% of Danone’s revenue, up from just 3% in 2006. At the same time, a slimmed-down core business, refocused on healthy yogurts and other nutritional foods, is still profitable and accounts for the majority of the business. 10. German steel maker ThyssenKrupp, under pressure from low-cost producers in Asia, decided to move drastically away from making and selling steel. Instead, in 2012 the firm began investing in industrial solutions, providing capital equipment, software and services to manufacturers, including refineries and automakers. The new growth area already accounts for 47% of total company revenue. The Transformation 10 report highlights a few takeaways and lessons that can help business leaders respond to market disruption and position their companies for the future, including: Transformational CEOs tend to be „insider outsiders.” Typically it’s not a complete outsider who instigates the change, but a leader who worked at the edges of the organization or in a parallel part of the industry. Transformation involves two separate journeys. The most effective transformation efforts are not monolithic but take a two-pronged approach: repositioning the core business while creating the future growth business. Transformation can only take root if you are constantly telling a story about the future. To transform a company, the CEO must also act as the „storyteller in chief.” That means telling different aspects of the same transformation narrative to all the constituencies and stakeholders in and of the company. Develop a roadmap for transformation before disruption takes hold. By the time the need to transform is clear, it is often too late. Leaders need to stay ahead of new technologies and competitors that can derail their business and act before fault lines are entirely clear. ABOUT THE TRANSFORMATION 10 RESEARCH The research focused on 57 companies from the S&P 500 and Global 500 that had made significant public commitments to transformation. The analysis evaluated public companies through three lenses: new growth, success in repositioning the core, and select financial metrics.  To assess areas of new growth, Innosight measured how successful these companies have been at creating new products, services, markets and business models, and in that process determined the percent of revenue that can be attributed to new growth areas. To measure success in repositioning the core business, Innosight examined how effectively these companies adapted their traditional businesses to changes or disruptions in their markets. The financial metrics that Innosight analyzed combined annual growth rate (CAGR) of each company’s revenue and stock price, as well as overall profitability, during their respective transformation periods. After narrowing down to a list of 18 companies, Innosight worked with a panel of business leaders to identify the 10 companies whose transformations had the biggest impact on their respective industries and the most potential to be sustained. The judges were: Chris Chadwick, former CEO, Boeing Defense; Clay Christensen, Professor, Harvard Business School and Innosight co-founder; Scott Cook, Founder and Chairman of Intuit; Matthew Eyring, Chief Strategy and Innovation Officer at Vivint; A.G. Lafley, former CEO of Procter & Gamble; Rita McGrath, Professor, Columbia Business School; Teo Ming Kian, Director Temasek and Chairman Vertex Holdings; Theodor Weimer, Country Chairman, UniCredit.

The company’s “Siri speaker” project has been in the works for some time, but so far Apple has managed to avoid any significant leaks about its features or design. Last September, Bloomberg reported that Apple engineers had begun in-home testing of a prototype device. A public unveiling could come at next month’s WWDC keynote. It’s unclear whether Apple’s unannounced product will feature a display (like Amazon’s brand new Echo Show) or instead focus just on audio (like the regular, cylindrical Echo speaker or Google Home). But VP Phil Schiller recently emphasized the value of consumer gadgets having a screen. “The idea of not having a screen, I don't think suits many situations,” Schiller said in an interview with Gadgets 360. He then cited some examples of that value: voice-only assistants can’t show you photos being shared on social media, Schiller said. If you’re asking for directions, you’ll hear them, but can’t see a map. “I think voice assistants are incredibly powerful. Their intelligence is going to grow. They're gonna do more for us, but the role of the screen is gonna remain very important to all of this,” he said. Apple’s Phil Schiller. The smartphone seems ideal for handling most of the tasks mentioned by Schiller, however, whereas the various Echo devices and Google Home are largely marketed as for short interactions, like checking the weather, playing music, or controlling smart home gadgets. “I think that's an interesting discussion about when is each appropriate, and what can they do in our lives,” Schiller said. Apple will certainly be playing catch-up with Amazon whenever it does launch a product. That said, the company’s executives don’t seem particularly impressed by the current field of products. “My mother used to have a saying that if you don't have something nice to say, say nothing at all,” Schiller said.

The iPhone 5S is all set to get a price cut down to Rs 15000, marking it for the mid-range market sector. A quick Google search shows that the iPhone 5S is currently available for around Rs 17500 in India after discounts by various e-commerce sites. Apple is seemingly only planning to sell it online. Online buying accounts for over 50% to 55% of iPhone sales in the country, much higher than the industry average of 30%. 3 industry executives told The Economic Times that the company’s distributors have told offline shops that iPhone 5S units will be eased out as part of this strategy. The iPhone SE may take up the mantle of becoming the most affordable iPhone available in a brick-and-mortar shop, retailing for Rs 20000 after cashback offers. Also See: Your iPhone’s Calculator app has a secret backspace hack One executive claims that this is actually Apple’s plan B when it comes to taking over the affordable market sector. Its initial idea was to sell certified refurbished models, but that proposal was rejected by the government. Another asserts that cutting the cost of the iPhone 5S also helps the company continue its rapid growth in India. The May to June period typically features a slow-down in sales up until October when new iPhone models arrive. The iPhone 5S is an ideal candidate for this move since it already accounts for over 20% of iPhone shipments into India, as per Counterpoint Research. Interestingly, one of the executives thinks that Apple’s Make In India plans will translate to a 10% to 12% cost advantage for the iPhone SE once the handset starts getting manufactured in the nation.

Unfortunately Apple's competitors aren't too thrilled with them and over in Europe, Spotify and a handful of other companies are going after Apple with allegations of anticompetitive practices.

He advises investors to look post a possible loss of business in Apple's next iPhone and instead look to the financial benefits that will accrue from its recent purchase of competitor Linear Technology. By Tiernan Ray May 9, 2017 12:36 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Morgan Stanley chip analyst Craig Hettenbach today urges investors that the recent weakness in the shares of Analog Devices (ADI) is “your second shot to buy into the ‘Dream Team,’ despite a variety of concerns, including its possible loss of business at Apple (AAPL). The stock has been week, he notes, since CFO David Zinsner announced his resignation March 6th to pursue a role with a venture firm. And since the company closed on its acquisition of Linear Technology on March 10th, shares have traded down 8%, versus a 2.7% rise in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index in that time. "To put this in further context,” writes Hettenbach, "ADI is down $6 since the deal closed a reaction that stands in stark contrast to the $15-$20 of value we think LLTC will add based on incremental EPS power of $1+. Hettenbach urges investors to buy the stock ahead of its May 31st earnings report. Among the worries the company is contending with, aside from the CFO departure, is recent speculation it has lost the business of supplying the "Force Touch” control chip in Apple next iPhone: ADI is trading at a 15.3x our new CY18 EPS, which excludes Force Touch revenue, suggesting to us that the stock already reflects the potential loss. For context, ADI is trading at a nearly 20% discount to TXN and a roughly 10% discount to the S&P 500. Furthermore, if ADI were to lose some content in the iPhone, we see the other growth drivers mentioned above that could help compensate. While risk to the company's Force Touch in iPhone 8 is unconfirmed, we have removed it from our model in the 2017 OLED SKU and across all phones in the next cycle in an attempt to derisk it. This reduces our FY17 revenue and EPS by $60mn/$0.08 and an additional $160mn/$0.16 in FY18. Importantly, our iPhone related estimates still include revenue for optical image stabilization in all dual camera SKUs. On the positive side of things, Hettenbach has put together what he thinks are the financial benefits of the Linear acquisition, and he likes what he sees. After factoring in some slowing sales, but also lower interest expense, he sees a case for buying the stock up to $93: Our CY17/18 MW EPS estimates come up from $3.94/$4.07 to $4.38/$5.00. We lower our estimates for core ADI slightly on consumer conservatism and expect cost savings from the LLTC deal to reach $160mn run rate ($45mn in CoGs and $115mn in Opex) by the July 18 quarter. Our new Modelware (MW, which incudes stock-based compensation) CY18 estimate of $5.00 is a touch below our prior pro forma EPS estimate of $5.14 as the benefit from lower incremental interest expense from the deal is offset by the drag from lower Linear revenue on weaker automotive sales and lower ADI consumer sales as we take the conservative approach, and higher than expected share count. Our PT of 3 $93, representing 18.5X multiple to our MW CY18e EPS of $5.00.

Cook is ranked number 4 behind Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Mark Zuckerberg. As CEO of Apple, one of the world's most valuable brands, Tim Cook has nearly unmatched influence over the technology world. Anything Apple does is bound to be copied by a seemingly endless number of rivals, meaning his choices will reverberate far beyond One Infinite Loop. Today, Apple is rumored to be experimenting with everything from advanced artificial intelligence to augmented reality and self-driving vehicles. Given Apple’s role as tastemaker extraordinaire, how Cook decides to move forward with any one of these projects will shape the future of the consumer technology landscape. Williams is number 17 on the list. CEO Tim Cook may be the public face and chief decision maker at Apple, but Jeff Williams is second in command. An Apple veteran who’s been with the company for nearly 20 years, Williams is often referred to as "Tim Cook's Tim Cook." He was named chief operating officer in late 2015, a post previously held by Cook, and has been overseeing Apple's entire supply chain since 2010, no small task given the complexity of the company’s hardware operations. Williams also oversaw development of the Apple Watch, the company’s first new product category during the Cook era and a sign he’s closely involved with new projects.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Wed, May 10, 2017 - Page 10　 Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Alipay’s First Pay deal to give it US market access PLAYING CATCH-UP:The deal is to put Alipay in the same league as Apple Pay in terms of acceptance, but China is way ahead of the US in mobile-payment uptake Bloomberg China’s mobile-payments king wants a piece of the world’s biggest consumer market. Alipay (支付寶), owned by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (阿里巴巴) chairman Jack Ma’s (馬雲) Ant Financial Services Group (螞蟻金服), reached a deal that would let its users shop at 4 million US merchants served by payments processor First Data Corp, the companies said on Monday in a joint statement. The rollout is to begin with businesses that use First Data’s Clover products. “This will open up Alipay to where it’s truly ubiquitous across the United States and hopefully more countries later,” Alipay North America president Souheil Badran said. In the US, “we decided rather than trying to do it on our own, this is an ecosystem that we’re looking for a partner that can provide scale,” he said. Alipay and Tencent Holdings Ltd’s (騰訊) WeChat Pay (微信支付) dominate the mobile-payments market in China with a combined 90 percent share. Alipay wants to leverage the millions of Chinese customers who go abroad by offering them services wherever they go. The firm’s mobile wallet — which can hold cards from American Express Co, Visa Inc and Mastercard Inc, among others — is already accepted by more than 100,000 retailers in 70 international markets, the company said. The First Data deal would put Alipay in the same league as Apple Pay in terms of acceptance. Apple Inc’s mobile payments service can be used at 4.5 million locations in the US, Apple chief executive officer Tim Cook said last week on a call with analysts. Still, Alipay, which started in 2004 as an online payments processor for Alibaba’s e-commerce sites, is entering a market that is much less reliant on mobile transactions than its home country. China’s mobile payments transactions topped 38 trillion yuan (US$5.5 trillion) last year, triple that of 2015, Beijing-based Iresearch said. That compares with US$112 billion in the US, Forrester Research said. Alipay is just the latest Chinese payments player looking to make a deeper push abroad. Ant Financial has agreed to pay US$1.2 billion for the US-based money-transfer service MoneyGram International Inc. In addition, China UnionPay Co (中國銀聯) is working with US payments networks to develop international standards for mobile payments. First Data, which was taken public by private-equity giant KKR & Co in 2015, operates a debit-card network, processes card transactions and provides merchants with fraud detection and data-analytics services. The company began a trial run with Alipay at select luxury stores in California and New York in November last year. First Data shares have climbed 17 percent this year, outpacing the 3.4 percent advance of the 245-company Russell 1000 Financial Services Index. On Monday, the company reported first-quarter revenue of US$1.73 billion, fueled by a 7 percent increase in transactions at its global business solutions unit. This story has been viewed 891 times.

The list -- which includes celebrated tech innovators like Amazon and Netflix as well as standouts from industries that don't as frequently make innovation headlines, including health care company DaVita and food and beverage giant Danone -- offers insights into how market leaders can sustain growth even as disruption threatens their historically successful core business. The Transformation 10, a new report by growth strategy consulting firm Innosight, analyzed 1,000 companies and engaged a panel of business leaders to identify the 10 companies whose transformations had the biggest impact on their respective industries and the most potential to be sustained. The judges included former P&G CEO A.G. Lafley, former Boeing Defense CEO Chris Chadwick, and Columbia business professor Rita Gunther McGrath. Online retailer Amazon and entertainment firm Netflix were tied atop the rankings, followed (in order) by travel-technology company Priceline; global tech firm Apple; health insurer Aetna; software company Adobe; health care firm DaVita; computer and software maker Microsoft; food and beverage company Danone; and steel maker ThyssenKrupp. "A company survives and thrives over time based not on its size at any given time, but on its ability to adapt to disruption and to reposition itself to create a new future. We believe that by identifying companies that are transforming successfully, we can gain a better understanding of the dynamics and success factors of transformation," notes Innosight managing partner Scott Anthony, who is the co-author of the just-released Dual Transformation: How to Reposition Today's Business While Creating the Future (Harvard Business Review Press). Each company in the Transformation 10 found a way to create new growth while repositioning its traditional business: 1. Online retail giant Amazon developed technology to streamline internal operations, then turned it into a cloud computing platform that Amazon began selling to outside customers as large as the U.S. government. Since beginning what is now Amazon Web Services (AWS) in 2006, the new growth area now delivers about 10% of revenue, and accounted for more than half of Amazon's operating profit in 2015. At the same time, Amazon has steadily fortified its core online retail business with new categories, including a growing library of music, movies and original programming. 2. Video entertainment company Netflix began shifting its business model to include on-demand streaming as well as traditional hard-copy DVD rentals in 2007. That core business of hard-copy rentals continues to exist, albeit in a diminished state. Meanwhile, Netflix's domestic and international streaming business posted almost 90% of the firm's revenue in 2015, and the company has been producing and commissioning its own content since 2013, another potential source of growth. 3. Travel-technology company Priceline was already the world leader in online travel in 2010, when it decided to provide a more complete service that included the "long tail" of travel suppliers beyond the major hotels (e.g., independent hotels, apartment buildings). To capture that new growth, Priceline acquired companies like Bookings.com and KAYAK, and the new growth business generated about 25% of revenue in 2015. Simultaneously, Priceline recalibrated its core business around helping customers plan a complete travel experience -- much like an online concierge. 4. Beginning in 2007, computer giant Apple moved beyond its successful computer hardware business to create the world's biggest ecosystem for digital content -- and then to build on that ecosystem with new devices like the iPhone. Apple continues to be a manufacturer of computers, but the revenue from the firm's digital networks and related products now accounts for 80% of the company. 5. Health insurer Aetna's traditional model of selling health insurance through employers has grown nearly 80% over the last four years. Starting in 2010, the firm also began selling care management directly to consumers, and health care IT services to providers. Revenue from these newer, "value-based" contracts now accounts for about 40% of overall firm revenue. 6. Software company Adobe dominated the market for creating and designing documents and images, thanks to brands like Photoshop, Illustrator and Acrobat. But by 2008, fearing a saturated user base and a shift to cloud-based business models, the firm announced a new focus on digital marketing and analytics through a software as a service (SaaS) business model. The core business of packaged creative software lives on as the Creative Cloud subscription service, and new growth through digital marketing now creates almost half (45%) of overall revenue. 7. Health care firm DaVita specialized in kidney dialysis, making its money on a traditional fee-for-service business model and becoming one of the largest operators in its field. But starting in 2012, DaVita began building an "integrated delivery network" to deliver dialysis care as well as manage patients' total healthcare. The core business -- dialysis care -- has nearly doubled over the last 10 years, while new growth now delivers 30% of total revenue. 8. Computer firm Microsoft continues to sell hardware and software; its legacy business offering still accounts for about half the company. But, starting in 2010, the firm made a bet on embracing cloud-based technology -- while building up its hardware business. Its Intelligent Cloud business, which includes Azure and on-premises server software, reported 2016 revenue of more than $25 billion, almost a third (32%) of the company total. 9. French food and beverage firm Danone moved beyond its traditional yogurt business to grow a portfolio of health brands, including baby foods and other early life nutrition products. Those newer brands now generate 29% of Danone's revenue, up from just 3% in 2006. At the same time, a slimmed-down core business, refocused on healthy yogurts and other nutritional foods, is still profitable and accounts for the majority of the business. 10. German steel maker ThyssenKrupp, under pressure from low-cost producers in Asia, decided to move drastically away from making and selling steel. Instead, in 2012 the firm began investing in industrial solutions, providing capital equipment, software and services to manufacturers, including refineries and automakers. The new growth area already accounts for 47% of total company revenue. The Transformation 10 report highlights a few takeaways and lessons that can help business leaders respond to market disruption and position their companies for the future, including: Transformational CEOs tend to be "insider outsiders." Typically it's not a complete outsider who instigates the change, but a leader who worked at the edges of the organization or in a parallel part of the industry. Transformation involves two separate journeys. The most effective transformation efforts are not monolithic but take a two-pronged approach: repositioning the core business while creating the future growth business. Transformation can only take root if you are constantly telling a story about the future. To transform a company, the CEO must also act as the "storyteller in chief." That means telling different aspects of the same transformation narrative to all the constituencies and stakeholders in and of the company. Develop a roadmap for transformation before disruption takes hold. By the time the need to transform is clear, it is often too late. Leaders need to stay ahead of new technologies and competitors that can derail their business and act before fault lines are entirely clear. ABOUT THE TRANSFORMATION 10 RESEARCH The research focused on 57 companies from the S&P 500 and Global 500 that had made significant public commitments to transformation. The analysis evaluated public companies through three lenses: new growth, success in repositioning the core, and select financial metrics.  To assess areas of new growth, Innosight measured how successful these companies have been at creating new products, services, markets and business models, and in that process determined the percent of revenue that can be attributed to new growth areas. To measure success in repositioning the core business, Innosight examined how effectively these companies adapted their traditional businesses to changes or disruptions in their markets. The financial metrics that Innosight analyzed combined annual growth rate (CAGR) of each company's revenue and stock price, as well as overall profitability, during their respective transformation periods. After narrowing down to a list of 18 companies, Innosight worked with a panel of business leaders to identify the 10 companies whose transformations had the biggest impact on their respective industries and the most potential to be sustained. The judges were: Chris Chadwick, former CEO, Boeing Defense; Clay Christensen, Professor, Harvard Business School and Innosight co-founder; Scott Cook, Founder and Chairman of Intuit; Matthew Eyring, Chief Strategy and Innovation Officer at Vivint; A.G. Lafley, former CEO of Procter & Gamble; Rita McGrath, Professor, Columbia Business School; Teo Ming Kian, Director Temasek and Chairman Vertex Holdings; Theodor Weimer, Country Chairman, UniCredit.

Apple sources said the changes are coming to “older and smaller stores that aren’t suitable for the full redesign we’ve seen in flagship stores.” Since not all locations can support the massive updates see in flagship locations like San Francisco and New York City, the company has put together a “halfway house” update to reflect Apple’s new look while working within the available space. While there are no firm details on what the updates will entail, Apple has but a greater focus on redefining their stores as community gathering places, adding in new spaces for its “Today at Apple” educational sessions and incorporating natural materials like wood and granite into their sleek designs.

The 16-year-old was charged with two counts of theft and one count of possession of a controlled substance, according to Vernon Hills police. On Thursday, a Vernon Hills resident selling an Apple watch on Craigslist agreed to meet a potential buyer at Grosse Pointe Park, police said. The seller was in her vehicle with her daughter while the suspect looked at the watch, and when the seller turned her attention to her daughter, the suspect ran away with the watch. The next day, a Gurnee resident selling two Apple watches on OfferUp agreed to meet a potential buyer in the first block of Warson Court, police said. The suspect was inspecting the watches and said she needed to go into the house for money, then walked into the backyard. A few minutes later, the seller knocked on the door to the home and was told by a woman inside that the suspect did not live there, police said. Investigators identified the suspect as the 16-year-old Vernon Hills girl based on descriptions, witnesses and video surveillance, police said. She was taken into custody Friday and referred to the Lake County Juvenile Court, police said. Her name was not released. Vernon Hills police offer their station as a place to conduct any transaction that originates on the Internet. The parking lot and lobby at 740 Lakeview Pkwy. can be used 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Previously from Chicago News Ald.

Tech Apple Science Cars Samsung Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES E3     Apple Unveils 3-year Smart Keyboard Repair Policy Posted: May 9 2017, 5:53am CDT | by Shane McGlaun, in News | Apple     Smart Keyboard not working? Apple Will fix it for three years. If you own an Apple Smart Keyboard, the company has determined that some of those keyboards might have what are termed "functional issues" during use. These issues including problems such as a non-functional Smart Connector and keys sticking, keys repeating, or keys that don't respond. Don't Miss: Today's Best Deals on Amazon.com To address the issues with the Smart keyboard Apple has devised a new 3-year repair policy that will ensure you get at least a trio of years use out of the keyboard. The policy covers the Smart keyboard for the 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro tablets reports MacRumors. Word of the program came via an internal memo that was sent out to Apple store and authorized service centers last week. If you have a Smart Keyboard that isn't functioning you can call your local store to schedule an appointment or visit an authorized service center to start the repair process. Apple support can also be contacted via other means including chat, phone, or email. With a policy that is so new, there may still be some Apple employees who are unfamiliar with the new policy and may require an escalation of repair requests to an AppleCare advisor according to MacRumors. It's great to see Apple be proactive about offering repairs on items it sees as potentially faulty. This story may contain affiliate links.

Cook ranked fourth for his "nearly unmatched influence over the technology world" as head of the world's most valuable company. Anything Apple does is bound to be copied by a seemingly endless number of rivals, meaning his choices will reverberate far beyond One Infinite Loop. Today, Apple is rumored to be experimenting with everything from advanced artificial intelligence to augmented reality and self-driving vehicles. Given Apple’s role as tastemaker extraordinaire, how Cook decides to move forward with any one of these projects will shape the future of the consumer technology landscape.Cook finished behind Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on the list. Williams ranked 17th for his "no small task" of overseeing Apple's entire supply chain since 2010 as Cook's right-hand man. Cook may be the public face and chief decision maker at Apple, but Jeff Williams is second in command. An Apple veteran who’s been with the company for nearly 20 years, Williams is often referred to as "Tim Cook's Tim Cook." He was named chief operating officer in late 2015, a post previously held by Cook, and has been overseeing Apple's entire supply chain since 2010, no small task given the complexity of the company’s hardware operations. Williams also oversaw development of the Apple Watch, the company’s first new product category during the Cook era and a sign he’s closely involved with new projects.Some others that made the list include IBM CEO Ginni Rometty, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick, FCC chairman Ajit Pai, and Google CEO Sundar Pichai.

The last Apple product I would categorize as influential was the iPad in 2010. Everything since then has either been an iteration, or not worthy of being called "influential". How many "square" smart watches with a "digital crown" do you see these days (granted, wearables are IMHO a niche/fad anyway). No Apple is not "doomed" (profits and stock price are sufficient proof of this). It seems to have befallen a worse fate.... mediocrity.

It was a good iPad. But increasingly, especially when the iPhone 6 came out with a bigger screen, I found that my iPad started gaining dust. The bigger iPhone could simply do all the same things as my iPad, and as my iPad's hardware got older — it still used Apple’s old-style charger — I stopped using it. Popular Searches Walt Disney Co DIS ▲ 112.07 +0.65 +0.58% Western Digital Corp WDC ▼ 88.88 -1.02 -1.13% Toshiba Machine Co Ltd TSHMY ▼ 17.14 -0.60 -3.38% Halozyme Therapeutics Inc HALO ▼ 13.84 -0.01 -0.07% But Apple’s newest iPad reminded me that for iPhone users, a big tablet that does the same things can be a huge luxury. Browsing the web, playing games, and checking social media is all more pleasant with a bigger screen. So a few weeks ago, I bought Apple’s newest iPad. Apple just calls it "iPad" but you might have better luck Googling “2017 iPad” or “iPad (5th Generation.)” Ultimately, it’s not that much different than the other iPads that have been sold over the past two years, except for one big change: It’s cheap. I paid $329 for mine.  But I couldn’t be happier with my purchase. It can’t do anything new compared to other iPads, but it’s a great value, and it’s clear that Apple has refined the iPad over the past seven years to simply be a great tablet for most people. I don’t use my new iPad for anything productive. I use it for content consumption, mostly — and it almost never leaves my house. And after using it for the past six weeks, I’m confident it’s the best couch computer ever. Here’s what I do on my iPad:© Provided by Business Insider Inc Crashlands         - I surf the web. Mobile Safari, the iPad's built-in browser, is awesome, stable, and fast, and there aren’t many websites that the iPad can’t handle. Load Error         - I play games. I’ve been exploring the large number of games available on Apple’s App Store, and there are a surprising amount of deep games that you could pour 20 or more hours into. I’ve been playing Crashlands lately.         - I watch video. I’ve been using my iPad to keep up with Nationals games on MLB At Bat while my roommates watch what they want to on TV. I’ve also watched HBO, Netflix, and other streaming services on the iPad’s sharp 9.7- inch screen. It’s pretty engrossing, especially with headphones.         - I check social media. If there’s one issue I have with Apple’s iPad in general, it’s that there’s no Instagram or Snapchat apps for iPad. That being said, it’s a perfect device to catch up with most of my social feeds, including Facebook and Instagram.         - I iMessage my friends. Texting from an iPad is difficult, but if your contacts use iMessage, it’s easy to send them notes and stuff from the iPad. Here’s what I don’t do on my iPad: anything resembling productivity. I set up my various email accounts on the device, but I turned notifications off, and I haven’t really checked my mail or sent any emails on the iPad. I can handle quick notes from my iPhone, and if I need to do any word processing or work, I’ll boot up my Mac. Design © Provided by Business Insider Inc Apple iPad 3 This iPad’s design is not going to surprise you. It’s a rectangle, centered around a beautiful, dense, high-pixel screen. I hadn’t used a 9.7-inch iPad on a regular basis since 2012, and I immediately noticed two things about this new iPad. First, it’s light enough you can use it for really long stretches of time, something that I didn’t find on my older, heavier iPad. Second, there’s no physical mute switch. You’ll have to turn the sound off on the touchscreen, or hold down the "volume down" rocker until it goes silent. Finally, all of Apple’s new iPads, including the 2017 model, come with a fingerprint sensor. While the fingerprint sensor is less useful on the iPad than it is on the iPhone, it can still be handy, especially if you plan to share your tablet with your family — simply give everyone their own fingerprint password. Battery life Apple says this iPad can manage 10 hours of battery life and I believe it. I haven’t timed how long it takes this iPad to completely run out of battery, but I do know it doesn’t seem to lose charge from day to day when I’m not using it, and it can last an entire afternoon gaming. I haven’t ever had an issue where the iPad ran out of batteries and I needed to charge it. For my use, the battery life isn’t just good enough — it’s unclear whether an improvement would make the iPad significantly better. Which iPad should I get? © Provided by Business Insider Inc ipad lineup I got the $329 model of the new iPad in Space Grey, because I prefer the black border around the tablet’s screen. It comes in gold and silver as well, but those come with a white bezel on the front side. The entry-level comes with 32GB of space, which is more than enough for me, because I’m not uploading videos or music onto my tablet. So far, it’s plenty of storage space for my use, and unless you know you use a lot of space, it probably will be for you too. After a month of heavy use, I still have over 15GB of space still available on my iPad. I also declined to get the cellular-enabled model. For $459, the iPad comes with a modem so you can get high-speed internet on the iPad without connecting to a Wi-Fi network. Of course, the cell service requires a monthly fee. Since I use my iPad at home, connected to Wi-Fi I didn’t need it — so I saved the money. Should you buy it? © Provided by Business Insider Inc Apple iPad 2 For nearly everybody, I think Apple’s newest iPad is the best value if you know you want an iPad.  You might want to upgrade to the iPad Pro 9.7-inch if you like the size and shape, but really want to be able to use Apple’s stylus, the Pencil. The 9.7-inch iPad Pro also has a slightly better screen, speakers, and camera, but for my usage, it’s not a huge upgrade, and since it costs $599 from the Apple store, it’s not worth the $270 extra for me. The more expensive iPad Pro also works with Apple’s keyboard case, but there are plenty of third-party options for the less expensive model. The bigger iPad Pro is the most expensive and heaviest iPad model. I used a review unit provided by Apple for a few months before I bought my new iPad. My advice is that if you’re using it for media consumption, like I do, then it’s not the best option. Not only is it more expensive, the ergonomics as a couch computer doesn’t work that well — it’s heavy, and feels oversized. Only get this one if you’re sure you want to use an iPad as a laptop replacement. The iPad Mini starts at $400, and its screen is the same resolution as the 9.7-inch iPads. It’s more expensive than the latest iPad, and it’s got a slower chip. I wouldn’t recommend it unless you’re sure you like the smaller tablet size.  It doesn’t support the Apple Pencil. If you don’t fit into one of these categories, I’d recommend Apple’s latest iPad. Apple’s pricing the tablet aggressively, and it’s a better value for most people than anything else in Apple’s tablet lineup.  © Provided by Business Insider Inc Apple iPad 4   Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

My Marketwired Account Personal Beat Marketwired Resonate Hot Off the Wire News Dashboard 2.0 Mediahub Register for a Marketwired Account News Room Print Friendly Share SOURCE: Innosight May 09, 2017 11:34 ET UPDATE - Ten Companies Lead in Responding to Radical Market Change and Reinventing Themselves for a Different Future, According to New Analysis of Public Company Data The "Transformation 10" Goes Beyond Celebrated Tech Companies, Says Innosight LEXINGTON, MA--(Marketwired - May 9, 2017) - As the pace of change accelerates in virtually every industry, a new study has identified the 10 global companies that have done the best job of remaking their businesses. The list -- which includes celebrated tech innovators like Amazon and Netflix as well as standouts from industries that don't as frequently make innovation headlines, including health care company DaVita and food and beverage giant Danone -- offers insights into how market leaders can sustain growth even as disruption threatens their historically successful core business. The Transformation 10, a new report by growth strategy consulting firm Innosight, analyzed 1,000 companies and engaged a panel of business leaders to identify the 10 companies whose transformations had the biggest impact on their respective industries and the most potential to be sustained. The judges included former P&G CEO A.G. Lafley, former Boeing Defense CEO Chris Chadwick, and Columbia business professor Rita Gunther McGrath. Online retailer Amazon and entertainment firm Netflix were tied atop the rankings, followed (in order) by travel-technology company Priceline; global tech firm Apple; health insurer Aetna; software company Adobe; health care firm DaVita; computer and software maker Microsoft; food and beverage company Danone; and steel maker ThyssenKrupp. "A company survives and thrives over time based not on its size at any given time, but on its ability to adapt to disruption and to reposition itself to create a new future. We believe that by identifying companies that are transforming successfully, we can gain a better understanding of the dynamics and success factors of transformation," notes Innosight managing partner Scott Anthony, who is the co-author of the just-released Dual Transformation: How to Reposition Today's Business While Creating the Future (Harvard Business Review Press). Each company in the Transformation 10 found a way to create new growth while repositioning its traditional business: 1. Online retail giant Amazon developed technology to streamline internal operations, then turned it into a cloud computing platform that Amazon began selling to outside customers as large as the U.S. government. Since beginning what is now Amazon Web Services (AWS) in 2006, the new growth area now delivers about 10% of revenue, and accounted for more than half of Amazon's operating profit in 2015. At the same time, Amazon has steadily fortified its core online retail business with new categories, including a growing library of music, movies and original programming. 2. Video entertainment company Netflix began shifting its business model to include on-demand streaming as well as traditional hard-copy DVD rentals in 2007. That core business of hard-copy rentals continues to exist, albeit in a diminished state. Meanwhile, Netflix's domestic and international streaming business posted almost 90% of the firm's revenue in 2015, and the company has been producing and commissioning its own content since 2013, another potential source of growth. 3. Travel-technology company Priceline was already the world leader in online travel in 2010, when it decided to provide a more complete service that included the "long tail" of travel suppliers beyond the major hotels (e.g., independent hotels, apartment buildings). To capture that new growth, Priceline acquired companies like Bookings.com and KAYAK, and the new growth business generated about 25% of revenue in 2015. Simultaneously, Priceline recalibrated its core business around helping customers plan a complete travel experience -- much like an online concierge. 4. Beginning in 2007, computer giant Apple moved beyond its successful computer hardware business to create the world's biggest ecosystem for digital content -- and then to build on that ecosystem with new devices like the iPhone. Apple continues to be a manufacturer of computers, but the revenue from the firm's digital networks and related products now accounts for 80% of the company. 5. Health insurer Aetna's traditional model of selling health insurance through employers has grown nearly 80% over the last four years. Starting in 2010, the firm also began selling care management directly to consumers, and health care IT services to providers. Revenue from these newer, "value-based" contracts now accounts for about 40% of overall firm revenue. 6. Software company Adobe dominated the market for creating and designing documents and images, thanks to brands like Photoshop, Illustrator and Acrobat. But by 2008, fearing a saturated user base and a shift to cloud-based business models, the firm announced a new focus on digital marketing and analytics through a software as a service (SaaS) business model. The core business of packaged creative software lives on as the Creative Cloud subscription service, and new growth through digital marketing now creates almost half (45%) of overall revenue. 7. Health care firm DaVita specialized in kidney dialysis, making its money on a traditional fee-for-service business model and becoming one of the largest operators in its field. But starting in 2012, DaVita began building an "integrated delivery network" to deliver dialysis care as well as manage patients' total healthcare. The core business -- dialysis care -- has nearly doubled over the last 10 years, while new growth now delivers 30% of total revenue. 8. Computer firm Microsoft continues to sell hardware and software; its legacy business offering still accounts for about half the company. But, starting in 2010, the firm made a bet on embracing cloud-based technology -- while building up its hardware business. Its Intelligent Cloud business, which includes Azure and on-premises server software, reported 2016 revenue of more than $25 billion, almost a third (32%) of the company total. 9. French food and beverage firm Danone moved beyond its traditional yogurt business to grow a portfolio of health brands, including baby foods and other early life nutrition products. Those newer brands now generate 29% of Danone's revenue, up from just 3% in 2006. At the same time, a slimmed-down core business, refocused on healthy yogurts and other nutritional foods, is still profitable and accounts for the majority of the business. 10. German steel maker ThyssenKrupp, under pressure from low-cost producers in Asia, decided to move drastically away from making and selling steel. Instead, in 2012 the firm began investing in industrial solutions, providing capital equipment, software and services to manufacturers, including refineries and automakers. The new growth area already accounts for 47% of total company revenue. The Transformation 10 report highlights a few takeaways and lessons that can help business leaders respond to market disruption and position their companies for the future, including: Transformational CEOs tend to be "insider outsiders." Typically it's not a complete outsider who instigates the change, but a leader who worked at the edges of the organization or in a parallel part of the industry. Transformation involves two separate journeys. The most effective transformation efforts are not monolithic but take a two-pronged approach: repositioning the core business while creating the future growth business. Transformation can only take root if you are constantly telling a story about the future. To transform a company, the CEO must also act as the "storyteller in chief." That means telling different aspects of the same transformation narrative to all the constituencies and stakeholders in and of the company. Develop a roadmap for transformation before disruption takes hold. By the time the need to transform is clear, it is often too late. Leaders need to stay ahead of new technologies and competitors that can derail their business and act before fault lines are entirely clear. ABOUT THE TRANSFORMATION 10 RESEARCH The research focused on 57 companies from the S&P 500 and Global 500 that had made significant public commitments to transformation. The analysis evaluated public companies through three lenses: new growth, success in repositioning the core, and select financial metrics.  To assess areas of new growth, Innosight measured how successful these companies have been at creating new products, services, markets and business models, and in that process determined the percent of revenue that can be attributed to new growth areas. To measure success in repositioning the core business, Innosight examined how effectively these companies adapted their traditional businesses to changes or disruptions in their markets. The financial metrics that Innosight analyzed combined annual growth rate (CAGR) of each company's revenue and stock price, as well as overall profitability, during their respective transformation periods. After narrowing down to a list of 18 companies, Innosight worked with a panel of business leaders to identify the 10 companies whose transformations had the biggest impact on their respective industries and the most potential to be sustained. The judges were: Chris Chadwick, former CEO, Boeing Defense; Clay Christensen, Professor, Harvard Business School and Innosight co-founder; Scott Cook, Founder and Chairman of Intuit; Matthew Eyring, Chief Strategy and Innovation Officer at Vivint; A.G. Lafley, former CEO of Procter & Gamble; Rita McGrath, Professor, Columbia Business School; Teo Ming Kian, Director Temasek and Chairman Vertex Holdings; Theodor Weimer, Country Chairman, UniCredit.

The documentary, called Harry Styles: Behind the Album, is made up of footage of Styles recording in a secluded studio in Jamaica (the same one Rihanna and Drake use sometimes) and rehearsing with his new band at the legendary Abbey Road studio in London. Based on the 30-second trailer, it looks like the documentary will be full of standard rock star stuff: Styles has a typewriter and then a Moleskine notebook; he’s sleeping and then he’s scuba diving; he’s super nervous and then he’s screaming. He wears black silk bell-bottoms and gets a hair cut. Update: Ben Winston, the director of most of One Direction’s music videos and their 2013 tour documentary This is Us was involved in this documentary as well. Very excited to announce our new film about @harry_styles will premiere on Apple Music on May 15th! https://t.co/f0l6ShRRWJ— Ben Winston (@benwinston) May 9, 2017 This marks Apple Music’s fourth documentary exclusive, following Taylor Swift’s 1989 World Tour documentary in December 2015, a history of the 808 drum machine in December 2016, and, most recently, Clive Davis: The Soundtrack of Our Lives, a purchase made at the Tribeca Film Festival last month. Apple has been experimenting sort of randomly with the idea of making original content and establishing Apple Music as a video-streaming service, so the accelerating pace of these exclusive documentary pickups makes sense for them. It is also, if you’re into this sort of thing, kind of funny that the only two working musicians to debut documentaries on the service also used to date and are widely known to have written music about each other. Specifically, the music featured in the documentaries. Harry Styles’ self-titled album will be released on Friday, May 12th. Updated May 9th, 12:15 PM: Updated to include Ben Winston’s tweet.

Video entertainment company Netflix began shifting its business model to include on-demand streaming as well as traditional hard-copy DVD rentals in 2007. That core business of hard-copy rentals continues to exist, albeit in a diminished state. Meanwhile, Netflix's domestic and international streaming business posted almost 90% of the firm's revenue in 2015, and the company has been producing and commissioning its own content since 2013, another potential source of growth. 3. Travel-technology company Priceline was already the world leader in online travel in 2010, when it decided to provide a more complete service that included the "long tail" of travel suppliers beyond the major hotels (e.g., independent hotels, apartment buildings). To capture that new growth, Priceline acquired companies like Bookings.com and KAYAK, and the new growth business generated about 25% of revenue in 2015. Simultaneously, Priceline recalibrated its core business around helping customers plan a complete travel experience -- much like an online concierge. 4. Beginning in 2007, computer giant Apple moved beyond its successful computer hardware business to create the world's biggest ecosystem for digital content -- and then to build on that ecosystem with new devices like the iPhone. Apple continues to be a manufacturer of computers, but the revenue from the firm's digital networks and related products now accounts for 80% of the company. 5. Health insurer Aetna's traditional model of selling health insurance through employers has grown nearly 80% over the last four years. Starting in 2010, the firm also began selling care management directly to consumers, and health care IT services to providers. Revenue from these newer, "value-based" contracts now accounts for about 40% of overall firm revenue. 6. Software company Adobe dominated the market for creating and designing documents and images, thanks to brands like Photoshop, Illustrator and Acrobat. But by 2008, fearing a saturated user base and a shift to cloud-based business models, the firm announced a new focus on digital marketing and analytics through a software as a service (SaaS) business model. The core business of packaged creative software lives on as the Creative Cloud subscription service, and new growth through digital marketing now creates almost half (45%) of overall revenue. 7. Health care firm DaVita specialized in kidney dialysis, making its money on a traditional fee-for-service business model and becoming one of the largest operators in its field. But starting in 2012, DaVita began building an "integrated delivery network" to deliver dialysis care as well as manage patients' total healthcare. The core business -- dialysis care -- has nearly doubled over the last 10 years, while new growth now delivers 30% of total revenue. 8. Computer firm Microsoft continues to sell hardware and software; its legacy business offering still accounts for about half the company. But, starting in 2010, the firm made a bet on embracing cloud-based technology -- while building up its hardware business. Its Intelligent Cloud business, which includes Azure and on-premises server software, reported 2016 revenue of more than $25 billion, almost a third (32%) of the company total. 9. French food and beverage firm Danone moved beyond its traditional yogurt business to grow a portfolio of health brands, including baby foods and other early life nutrition products. Those newer brands now generate 29% of Danone's revenue, up from just 3% in 2006. At the same time, a slimmed-down core business, refocused on healthy yogurts and other nutritional foods, is still profitable and accounts for the majority of the business. 10. German steel maker ThyssenKrupp, under pressure from low-cost producers in Asia, decided to move drastically away from making and selling steel. Instead, in 2012 the firm began investing in industrial solutions, providing capital equipment, software and services to manufacturers, including refineries and automakers. The new growth area already accounts for 47% of total company revenue. The Transformation 10 report highlights a few takeaways and lessons that can help business leaders respond to market disruption and position their companies for the future, including: Transformational CEOs tend to be "insider outsiders." Typically it's not a complete outsider who instigates the change, but a leader who worked at the edges of the organization or in a parallel part of the industry. Transformation involves two separate journeys. The most effective transformation efforts are not monolithic but take a two-pronged approach: repositioning the core business while creating the future growth business. Transformation can only take root if you are constantly telling a story about the future. To transform a company, the CEO must also act as the "storyteller in chief." That means telling different aspects of the same transformation narrative to all the constituencies and stakeholders in and of the company. Develop a roadmap for transformation before disruption takes hold. By the time the need to transform is clear, it is often too late. Leaders need to stay ahead of new technologies and competitors that can derail their business and act before fault lines are entirely clear. ABOUT THE TRANSFORMATION 10 RESEARCH The research focused on 57 companies from the S&P 500 and Global 500 that had made significant public commitments to transformation. The analysis evaluated public companies through three lenses: new growth, success in repositioning the core, and select financial metrics.  To assess areas of new growth, Innosight measured how successful these companies have been at creating new products, services, markets and business models, and in that process determined the percent of revenue that can be attributed to new growth areas. To measure success in repositioning the core business, Innosight examined how effectively these companies adapted their traditional businesses to changes or disruptions in their markets. The financial metrics that Innosight analyzed combined annual growth rate (CAGR) of each company's revenue and stock price, as well as overall profitability, during their respective transformation periods. After narrowing down to a list of 18 companies, Innosight worked with a panel of business leaders to identify the 10 companies whose transformations had the biggest impact on their respective industries and the most potential to be sustained. The judges were: Chris Chadwick, former CEO, Boeing Defense; Clay Christensen, Professor, Harvard Business School and Innosight co-founder; Scott Cook, Founder and Chairman of Intuit; Matthew Eyring, Chief Strategy and Innovation Officer at Vivint; A.G. Lafley, former CEO of Procter & Gamble; Rita McGrath, Professor, Columbia Business School; Teo Ming Kian, Director Temasek and Chairman Vertex Holdings; Theodor Weimer, Country Chairman, UniCredit.

Knowledge center Diabetes Complementary Medicine / Alternative Medicine Personal Monitoring / Wearable Technology Obesity / Weight Loss / Fitness Best diabetes apps of 2017 Written by Jon JohnsonReviewed by Natalie Olsen, RD, LD, ACSM EP-C Last reviewed: Tue 9 May 2017 Last reviewed: Tue 9 May 2017 email Rates of diabetes may be higher than ever, but there are many apps that can help people with diabetes manage their condition. According to research posted to the Journal of the American Medical Association, as much as 12-14 percent of the adult population in the United States is affected by diabetes. However, the modern era has made managing the disorder easier than ever before. Desktop and mobile apps are widely available for users to easily track and manage their conditions. This may help them to make positive changes and help manage their blood sugar levels safely. Contents of this article: What to look for in a diabetes app Diabetes logbook apps Apps for people newly diagnosed with diabetes Food and exercise apps Finding the best diabetes app What to look for in a diabetes app There are a number of apps available to help alleviate some of the stress that comes from daily diabetes management. One of the most important parts of personal diabetes management is being able to monitor the following factors: blood sugar levels carbohydrate intake body weight There can be a lot of numbers and times to remember, and a lot of math goes into every meal of the day. This can be an annoying experience. Luckily, there are several apps that take some of the heavy burden off the shoulders of someone with diabetes. There are a number of different things that affect the average person with diabetes. As such, there are also a few different categories of diabetes apps. These include: logbook apps calorie counters diet apps carbohydrate counting apps general diabetes management apps This article reviews some of the best diabetes apps of the year. Diabetes logbook apps Logbook apps enable people with diabetes to keep a log of the vital statistics that relate to their condition. The most important being their blood sugar levels. mySugr The diabetes app, mySugr, is a personalized logbook app for both Apple and Android devices. Users can change the way they log key statistics to a way that suits them. The app helps users to analyze these statistics in order to achieve their goals. The app also has an estimated HbA1c feature, for glycated hemoglobin measurements. This provides an overall picture of average blood sugar levels based on personalized tracking statistics. It provides feedback and supports a user in their treatment goals. The app also securely backs up all of the information that is entered. The pro version of the app, which is $2.99/month, includes: blood sugar reminders printable readouts for a doctor's visit and personal records a smart search feature to find diabetes-friendly meals, places, and activities There is even a mySugr junior app, designed for open communication between children with diabetes and their doctors and carers. GlucOracle GlucOracle is a new app from Columbia University Medical Center. It helps to forecast a person's blood sugar levels. Each meal submitted gives users a look at their projected glucose levels after the meal. This allows people to prevent spikes and crashes and to take insulin before they eat a meal. The app creates a personalized algorithm that tries to mimic your endocrine system. After about 7 days, or 20 meals, of using it, personal glucose forecasts are dialed in for most users. GlucOracle users can also get feedback about the nutrients in their meals to help them monitor and improve their food intake. GlucOracle is available for both Apple and Android devices. Glucose Buddy Some apps help people monitor their glucose levels and give handy reminders when the next blood sugar test is due.

The app can automatically identify blood sugar trends and remind the user if any adjustments are needed. A more comprehensive page is also available that shows graphs. These can be filtered by data and date to find the exact information a person needs. BG Monitor can help calculate insulin levels for each meal based on the data that it is given. Users enter blood glucose levels and the foods to be eaten, and the app can calculate how much insulin a person will need. It is an all-around quick and convenient app. Glooko logbook Glooko is a pay-to-use app for Android devices that is said to have a good reputation with users. It is designed to help people see how their diabetes impacts them, personally. It can display a number of key bits of information, including: times of day blood sugar spikes or falls days of the week diabetes has the biggest impact how the user's blood sugarlevels compare to other data The built-in food database automatically tracks carbs, and graphs and trends can be viewed in multiple ways. The app is ready to be synced with data from weight and blood pressure trackers for a comprehensive experience. DiabetesConnect The DiabetesConnect app is available for both Android and Apple devices, and is easy to use. Users can record blood sugar, meals, injections and medications, and other important stats directly to the app. It is suitable for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, and its features can be turned off and on as needed to avoid clutter. Important medical statistics are housed in the app, and all the information can sync to multiple devices for use from the home or office. The data can then be exported to a doctor for a quick checkup in between appointments. Apps for people newly diagnosed with diabetes Diabetes can be difficult for newly diagnosed individuals, especially children, to understand. Here are some apps which make the learning process easier: Carb counting with Lenny Learning to manage type 1 diabetes can be especially difficult for children and their parents, but there are apps available to help make the process fun. The app Carb counting with Lenny is designed to help ease kids or adults new to diabetes into managing their conditions. It helps people to monitor their carb intake, and turns carb-counting into a fun experience, with the help of a friendly lion character. The food guide feature helps to learn the carb values of different foods, and the carb games feature tests a person's knowledge with interactive games. It is a good beginner's app to understanding the carb values of various foods. Diabetes:M Diabetes:M is an app for Apple and Android designed to help users understand and manage diabetes. It enables users to: track food intake monitor their diet enter their important values on-the-go in the logbook analyze their data in an instant The app is equipped with a Bolus calculator for balanced insulin injections. It can also remind users of their forthcoming tests or appointments, and allow them to easily exports data to a doctor before the next visit. Food and exercise apps There are many food and exercise apps available, including: MyFitnessPal MyFitnessPal is a calorie counter app for both Apple and Android that is designed to help users lose weight. It has more than 6 million foods in its database, and is equipped with a barcode scanner to make input even easier. All nutrients can be tracked, and the app allows users to set goals.

It has a community of like-minded users to help keep people motivated in their weight loss journeys. Finding the best diabetes app There are a lot of apps on the market. Choosing the right one is a matter of understanding both personal preferences and weak points in an individual's treatment plan. If someone has trouble counting their carbs, which is leading to spikes in blood sugar levels, a carb-counting app may be best. However, if math is not their best subject, an app which calculates their A1C for them will be a better choice. Understanding what an individual's needs are is the number one factor in choosing an app for diabetes.

Gothamist is a website about New York View Pretty | Blog Arts & Entertainment Food News Popular Advertising Contact Newsletter RSS Feed Staff Our Cities Chicago London Los Angeles New York City San Francisco Shanghai Toronto Washington DC The Fifth Ave Apple Cube Has Vanished by Rebecca Fishbein in News on May 9, 2017 11:11 am Goodnight, Sweet Prince. (Josh Weiner) The famed Fifth Avenue glass Apple Cube is no more, at least for the foreseeable future. Though the cube existed just yesterday, this morning tipster Josh Weiner spotted a gaping chasm by the GM Building where the monument to interminable lines for the Genius Bar once stood. Though it is a sad day for single-pane glass, the good news is, it'll allegedly be back once Apple's done with some renovations on the flagship store, though one should always be skeptical of locations that are "closed for renovations." RIP HUNAN BALCONY. Apple apparently spent $2 million to take down the cube to help facilitate its massive expansion at the 767 Fifth Avenue space—the store plans to swell from 32,000 to 77,000 square feet in order to accommodate more tourists and their unending questions about iPads. Apple has temporarily taken up residence at the former FAO Schwarz space inside the GM Building, so instead of being full of expensive toys for children, it is now full of expensive toys for adults, and also children. The Apple Cube initially wowed New Yorkers when the Apple Store first opened in 2006, and then again in 2011 when they replaced the 90 glass panels with 15 larger, seamless glass panels (which, if you're curious, were not shatterproof). The Fifth Avenue cube will allegedly return "late next year," whereupon Apple will move out of FAO Schwarz and Under Armour will move in, which is pretty depressing, honestly. Anyway, if you miss the cube, you can visit the less cube-y Apple Cube on the Upper West Side, or you can find some kind of hobby.

(AAPL) Will Never Buy Tesla Inc (TSLA) An Apple-Tesla pairing would send fanboys into a frenzy, but from a business perspective, it would be a poor pairing By Tom Taulli, InvestorPlace Writer & IPO Playbook Editor  |  May 9, 2017, 10:34 am EDT Get AAPL alerts: Submit Source: Shutterstock     View All   Popular Posts: Why Apple Inc. (AAPL) Will Never Buy Tesla Inc (TSLA) 3 Reasons to Buy Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Right Now Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Can Hit $80 Without Blinking Recent Posts: Yelp Inc (YELP) Stock Torched By 28% on Horrific Q1 Earnings Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Can Ride Messenger to the Moon Why Apple Inc. (AAPL) Will Never Buy Tesla Inc (TSLA) View All Posts Citigroup analyst Jim Suva recently published a buzzworthy report on buyout opportunities for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). A few names seemed reasonable, but one candidate — Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) — was downright fanciful. Source: Shutterstock Suva didn’t have high odds on the deal — at just 5%, he likes Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and even Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS), which would be expensive — far better as potential options. I think even 5% overstates it. There is no chance AAPL will ever buy TSLA. That’s not to imply that Apple isn’t serious about the self-driving space. The market is too big to ignore, with a research report from the Boston Consulting Group predicting that a quarter of all miles in the U.S. could be traversed autonomously by “the end of the next decade.” However, Apple — which it has done with other categories via things like HealthKit and HomeKit — wants to focus on building a software program. While AAPL recently was granted a permit from the California Department of Motor Vehicles for trials of an autonomous vehicle, this likely is just to test out software, not a physical car. But even if the company changes its strategy, I still think the odds of Apple buying out TSLA are nil. There are considerable risks to a deal, which you can observe simply by looking at Tesla’s recent earnings report. For instance … Business Model: Tesla is a complex company that’s executing the full-on advanced manufacturing of vehicles, the development of next-generation batteries and even marketing of solar panels (via the acquisition of SolarCity). Apple has a much different business model that eschews manufacturing and instead relies on strategic outsourcing partnerships with the likes of Foxconn. Buying TSLA would force a radical departure from the current system. Transition: Tesla has its hands full at the moment making a play for the mass market via the Model 3. Success is far from guaranteed, and already, branding seems to be an issue. In a letter to TSLA stock holders, CEO Elon Musk said: “Moving past Q2, particularly as Model 3 becomes available, one of our challenges will be to eliminate any misperception about the differences between Model S and Model 3. We have seen a belief among some that Model 3 is the newest and more advanced generation of Model S. This is not correct.” Musk actually referred to this as “anti-selling”!  This probably explains the $50 million drop in customer deposits for the year so far to $616 million. Scale: During the earnings report, Musk also said he is confident that sales will hit 1 million by 2020, up from 84,000 last year. But even if TSLA reaches those lofty goals, the company would remain a niche operator. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (NYSE:FCAU) CEO Sergio Marchionne, for instance, recently said an automaker needs to sell 15 million vehicles per year to remain viable.

Now, they can show you stuff, too. By Mark Gurman. Added by Agency Staff on 9 May 2017. Saved under Gadgets & Reviews, Top Tweet Amazon’s voice-activated Echo speakers already tell you things. Now, they can show you stuff, too. On Tuesday, the company unveiled the Echo Show, which features a seven-inch touch screen that can pull up calendar appointments, display music lyrics, play videos and a lot more. The Echo Show will cost US$229 when it goes on sale in late June, $50 more than the current high-end model. The debut follows last month’s introduction of the Echo Look, which can evaluate a user’s wardrobe. Including the two new entrants, Amazon will have five products in the Echo line-up, all powered by the Alexa digital assistant. Amazon’s gadget business isn’t about big profits; it’s a way to hook consumers into the company’s fast-growing retail business and get people to sign up for the lucrative Prime subscription service. Meanwhile, Amazon has managed to outflank Google, which began selling its Home device two years after the Echo debuted, and Apple, which is still working on its own Siri-based version. Amazon won’t say how many Echos have been sold, but it has grabbed 70% of the US market for voice-assisted speakers, according to eMarketer, with Google accounting for most of the rest. In a demonstration at Amazon’s San Francisco offices, the Echo Show displayed full weather forecasts, news headlines and LeBron James highlights. The company says the device will also play camera feeds from such connected devices as baby monitors and camera-equipped door bells. Services that already connect to the Echo will be able to display information — say, how far an Uber is from your front door. Alexa currently supports 12 000 “skills”, Amazon’s term for third-party services, and over time will offer increasingly comprehensive information, such as the points scored by a specific player. “We’re not trying to build a phone or tablet interface on this, but extend that ambient nature of what you already have with an Echo,” says Amazon devices chief Dave Limp, who has been testing the Show at home for about a year. This is the first Echo speaker with a built-in camera. The 5-megapixel sensor makes possible a new video conferencing service that Amazon is rolling out alongside the new hardware. Similar to Apple’s FaceTime, the service lets people make video calls from one Echo Show to another, or between the Show and an updated Alexa app on a smartphone. The service doubles as an intercom, allowing a person to call an Alexa speaker in another room without a camera. Users can’t currently make cellphone calls via the Echo Show. The Echo Show screen is slightly smaller than an iPad mini’s and the same size as the Kindle Fire tablet. The Intel-powered device has better sound than its predecessor, eight microphones instead of seven and can now connect directly to WiFi, not solely via the Alexa smartphone app. By pushing a button, you can disable the camera and microphones. Limp says hackers won’t be able to activate the camera remotely. The new Echo will stream music from Amazon’s own service, Spotify and Pandora, but not Apple Music. “We’d love to have Apple, but they’re not super big” on opening up Apple Music integration, Limp says. (Apple Music subscribers can do a workaround by streaming audio from their smartphone to the Echo device via Bluetooth.) Will the new Echo enhance Amazon’s first-mover advantage? Photos of the Show — a black or white wedge of plastic — elicited decidedly mixed reviews on Twitter, with one person saying it belonged on Star Trek (presumably the original) and another comparing it with the Chumby, a chunky digital assistant whose maker filed for bankruptcy. The Show may also be too pricey for many consumers. A report released on Monday by Consumer Intelligence Research Partners in Chicago said the cheapest Echo product, the $50, hockey puck-shaped Dot, has accounted for more than half of the estimated 10,7m Echo devices sold since 2014. Plus Apple, maker of beautiful products even when they aren’t hits, potentially could leapfrog the Show. In a recent research note, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said Apple may debut an Echo rival next month at the company’s annual developer’s conference. Apple employees have been testing a device at home for several months, according to people familiar with the matter. While marketing chief Phil Schiller recently talked up the benefits of having a screen on a voice-activated device, it’s not clear whether the Apple version will in fact have one.  — (c) 2017 Bloomberg LP   Share this article Tweet Connect with TechCentral Follow TechCentral on Twitter Connect with TechCentral on Facebook Connect with TechCentral on Google+ Subscribe to our newsletter Articles by comments (7 days) 10Council slams Mophatlane exit at BCX 6Hlaudi to ‘impart study tips’ to kids 5Samsung replaces ADH for S8, S8+ 4Telkom creates dedicated e-sports company 4How Takealot will spend the Naspers millions Home About Advertise Newsletter Contact RSS ↑ TechCentral TechCentral Log in - (c) 2009 - 2015 NewsCentral Media

Dan Charles/NPR Apple growers in Washington state, who dominate American apple production, are starting to plant a new kind of apple. It's the fastest launch of a new variety in history. These farmers have been looking for a new variety to grow. Older types of apples, like Red Delicious, have fallen out of favor among American consumers. So growers are ripping out old fruit trees — in this case, apricot trees — to make way for an apple variety called Cosmic Crisp. It's the most successful result so far of an apple breeding effort that Bruce Barritt began at Washington State University more than 20 years ago. Enlarge this image Bruce Barritt, retired apple breeder Dan Charles/NPR hide caption toggle caption Dan Charles/NPR Bruce Barritt, retired apple breeder Dan Charles/NPR Barritt selected the tree called WA 38 — now branded as Cosmic Crisp — from among thousands of seedings that he created by cross-pollinating the blossoms of parent trees. Cosmic Crisp, he says, preserves its taste better than any other variety during months of storage. "Crispness, juiciness, acidity, sugar; all that combined just doesn't exist in any other variety," he says. Cosmic Crisp was just released for commercial planting, and this spring, apple growers are planting all the trees that they can get their hands on. They've reportedly ordered 12 million Cosmic Crisp trees for planting over the next few years. Workers and freshly planted Cosmic Crisp trees in an orchard owned by McDougall and Sons, near Wenatchee, Wash. Dan Charles/NPR hide caption toggle caption Dan Charles/NPR Replanting can cost more than $50,000 per acre. Farmers say that they'll need premium prices for these apples in order to recoup that investment. If Cosmic Crisp apples sell only for the same price as, say, Gala apples, "it'll be a wreck," says farmer Jan Luebber. So these new plantings are a big gamble for apple growers. Enlarge this image The Cosmic Crisp mother tree Dan Charles/NPR hide caption toggle caption Dan Charles/NPR The Cosmic Crisp mother tree Dan Charles/NPR Every Cosmic Crisp tree is derived from this original "mother tree," which still stands where it was planted 20 years ago, in a research orchard managed by Washington State University. It's been reproduced through old-fashioned cloning techniques, grafting buds from one tree onto existing apple tree roots. Those buds grow into copies of the original tree. Tree nurseries like Willow Drive Nursery, in the town of Ephrata, Wash., play a key role in the Cosmic Crisp launch. They reproduce these trees on a massive scale, growing new trees from each bud that forms on existing trees in their "mother orchard." Each fall, nurseries dig up these small trees and move them into cold storage, ready for planting in orchards the following spring.

Within a few years, Washington's apple growers may know whether the bet they've placed on this new variety will pay off. These apples put out for a taste test are Honeycrisp (from left), Jazz, Gala, Red Delicious and Cosmic Crisp.

Despite many advances in the iPhone software, there are still many ways Android beats the iPhone, and iOS 11 could change that. After using the iPhone 7, Samsung Galaxy S8 and the LG G6 we’ve come away with a wishlist of new iOS 11 features that we hope Apple adds this year. We will learn a lot about the new iOS 11 features at WWDC in early June, so there isn’t much time left to wait until we learn about new iPhone and iPad features for 2017. Apple traditionally announces most of the new features in June and holds over some surprises for the fall. The new iOS 11 features we want on iPhone and iPad in 2017. iOS 11 features typically don’t arrive on all devices in the same manner, so there is a good chance that some of these new iPhone features will only arrive on the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus and newer devices. Thanks to leaks and to other sources we know some potential iOS 11 features that we will see later this year, but this is mostly a wishlist of features we want to see on the iPhone and iPad in 2017. New iOS 11 Emoji   1 / 9  Every summer there are new Emoji confirmed, and soon after we get new iPhone emoji. This year we are looking forward to new iOS 11 emoji coming in the fall.  Apple traditionally adds new emoji to the iPhone and iPad with iOS updates. Sometimes these are smaller updates and other times it makes more sense to hold off until a major update.  With an iOS 11 beta expected in June and 69 new emoji coming with Unicode 10 in 2017 it makes sense that we will see new iOS 11 emoji instead of a special iOS 10.3.3 or iOS 10.4 update to add new emoji.  While we have Bitmoji and plenty of emoji already, this is something we want to see come with iOS 11 especially since they are making their way into our lives more every day.    1 / 9 Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

But at least one analyst believes most targets aren't in Apple's sights. In a note to investors on Tuesday, UBS analyst Steven Milunovich said that the possibility of Apple inking a "mega-merger" deal with another sizable company is rather low. Milunovich said that while certain acquisition targets have been floated—like Netflix (nflx) and Tesla (tsla)—they don't necessarily make sense. "[Apple CEO Tim] Cook has said he is not averse to a large deal, but we think it would need to leapfrog Apple ahead in an area of interest, such as transportation, [augmented reality], health, home automation, and perhaps content," Milunovich wrote to investors. "The majority of what has been proposed doesn't fit, in our view." As Apple's (aapl) cash coffers have grown to a quarter of a trillion dollars, speculation has mounted that the company would—and perhaps should—make a major acquisition. Last year, Disney (dis) and Time Warner (twx) were briefly floated as possible options for Apple to grow its original content business. Apple is slowing building out a streaming-video business, which has caused other analysts to suggest a Netflix buy could also make some sense. And if Apple is indeed interested in breaking into the car business, buying a company like Tesla could be a good idea, some reports have said. Apple has quietly acquired a slew of companies in recent years. However, the majority of those companies are small startups that can help the company improve a feature in its hardware or software service. Apple's last big, flashy deal was in 2014 when it acquired Beats for $3 billion. Since then, Beats has stayed on as a headphone maker, and software it developed before the acquisition now powers Apple Music, the iPhone maker's streaming-music application. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter Cook hasn't shied away from conversations about acquisitions with both shareholders and analysts in earnings calls. And Cook has said that he'd be open to be a big acquisition if it makes some sense. But at least for now, Cook is content with smaller buys instead of the "mega-merger" Milunovich references. Part of the reason Apple might not have made a major acquisition by now—and why it might not—is its culture, Milunovich wrote to clients. He said that Apple's culture is "unusual," which makes integrating another company into the Apple way of doing things rather difficult. He also questioned whether an acquisition of a content creator like Disney would even make sense, because Apple's business model centers on selling hardware and services and not content. Still, Milunovich acknowledged in his note to investors that Apple will likely need to make a big buy at some point in the future. Milunovich said that Apple's heavy reliance upon the iPhone to drive revenue is a risk to its business, and it needs to catch up in "certain target markets" he did not identify. But Milunovich stopped short of saying that Apple would need to buy a company to boost its financial performance. Instead, Milunovich believes Apple will only buy a company if the target improves its product lineup.

Dan Charles/NPR Apple growers in Washington state, who dominate American apple production, are starting to plant a new kind of apple. It's the fastest launch of a new variety in history. These farmers have been looking for a new variety to grow. Older types of apples, like Red Delicious, have fallen out of favor among American consumers. So growers are ripping out old fruit trees — in this case, apricot trees — to make way for an apple variety called Cosmic Crisp. It's the most successful result so far of an apple breeding effort that Bruce Barritt began at Washington State University more than 20 years ago. Enlarge this image Bruce Barritt, retired apple breeder Dan Charles/NPR hide caption toggle caption Dan Charles/NPR Bruce Barritt, retired apple breeder Dan Charles/NPR Barritt selected the tree called WA 38 — now branded as Cosmic Crisp — from among thousands of seedings that he created by cross-pollinating the blossoms of parent trees. Cosmic Crisp, he says, preserves its taste better than any other variety during months of storage. "Crispness, juiciness, acidity, sugar; all that combined just doesn't exist in any other variety," he says. Cosmic Crisp was just released for commercial planting, and this spring, apple growers are planting all the trees that they can get their hands on. They've reportedly ordered 12 million Cosmic Crisp trees for planting over the next few years. Workers and freshly planted Cosmic Crisp trees in an orchard owned by McDougall and Sons, near Wenatchee, Wash. Dan Charles/NPR hide caption toggle caption Dan Charles/NPR Replanting can cost more than $50,000 per acre. Farmers say that they'll need premium prices for these apples in order to recoup that investment. If Cosmic Crisp apples sell only for the same price as, say, Gala apples, "it'll be a wreck," says farmer Jan Luebber. So these new plantings are a big gamble for apple growers. Enlarge this image The Cosmic Crisp mother tree Dan Charles/NPR hide caption toggle caption Dan Charles/NPR The Cosmic Crisp mother tree Dan Charles/NPR Every Cosmic Crisp tree is derived from this original "mother tree," which still stands where it was planted 20 years ago, in a research orchard managed by Washington State University. It's been reproduced through old-fashioned cloning techniques, grafting buds from one tree onto existing apple tree roots. Those buds grow into copies of the original tree. Tree nurseries like Willow Drive Nursery, in the town of Ephrata, Wash., play a key role in the Cosmic Crisp launch. They reproduce these trees on a massive scale, growing new trees from each bud that forms on existing trees in their "mother orchard." Each fall, nurseries dig up these small trees and move them into cold storage, ready for planting in orchards the following spring.

Within a few years, Washington's apple growers may know whether the bet they've placed on this new variety will pay off. These apples put out for a taste test are Honeycrisp (from left), Jazz, Gala, Red Delicious and Cosmic Crisp.

Now, they can show you stuff, too.  On Tuesday, the Seattle-based giant unveiled the Echo Show, which features a seven-inch touch screen that can pull up calendar appointments, display music lyrics, play videos and a lot more. Bloomberg reported on the new device last November. The Echo Show will cost $229 when it goes on sale in late June, $50 more than the current high-end model. The debut follows last month's introduction of the Echo Look, which can evaluate a user's wardrobe. Including the two new entrants, Amazon will have five products in the Echo lineup, all powered by the Alexa digital assistant. Echo Show Source: Amazon Amazon's gadget business isn't about big profits; it's a way to hook consumers into the company's fast-growing retail business and get people to sign up for the lucrative Prime subscription service. Meanwhile, Amazon has managed to outflank Google, which began selling its Home device two years after the Echo debuted, and Apple, which is still working on its own Siri-based version. Amazon won't say how many Echos have been sold, but it has grabbed 70 percent of the U.S. market  for voice-assisted speakers, according to eMarketer, with Google accounting for most of the rest. In a demonstration at Amazon's San Francisco offices, the Echo Show displayed full weather forecasts, news headlines and LeBron James highlights. The company says the device will also play camera feeds from such connected devices as baby monitors and camera-equipped door bells. Services that already connect to the Echo will be able to display information—say how far an Uber is from your front door or the basic box score for a baseball game. Alexa currently supports 12,000 "skills," Amazon's term for third-party services, and over time will offer increasingly comprehensive information, such as the points scored by a specific player.  "We're not trying to build a phone or tablet interface on this, but extend that ambient nature of what you already have with an Echo," says Amazon devices chief Dave Limp, who has been testing the Show at home for about a year.  This is the first Echo speaker with a built-in camera. The five-megapixel sensor makes possible a new video conferencing service that Amazon is rolling out alongside the new hardware. Similar to Apple's FaceTime, the service lets people make video calls from one Echo Show to another, or between the Show and an updated Alexa app on a smartphone. The service doubles as an intercom, allowing a person to call an Alexa speaker in another room without a camera. Users can't currently make cell phone calls via the Echo Show.  The Echo Show screen is slightly smaller than an iPad mini's and the same size as the Kindle Fire tablet. The Intel-powered device has better sound than its predecessor, eight microphones instead of seven and can now connect directly to WiFi, not solely via the Alexa smartphone app. By pushing a button, you can disable the camera and microphones. Limp says hackers won't be able to activate the camera remotely.  The new Echo will stream music from Amazon's own service, Spotify and Pandora, but not Apple Music. "We'd love to have Apple, but they're not super big" on opening up Apple Music integration, Limp says. (Apple Music subscribers can do a workaround by streaming audio from their smartphone to the Echo device via Bluetooth.) Will the new Echo enhance Amazon's first-mover advantage? Photos of the Show—a black or white wedge of plastic—elicited decidedly mixed reviews on Twitter, with one person saying it belonged on Star Trek (presumably the original) and another comparing it with the Chumby, a chunky digital assistant whose maker filed for bankruptcy. The Show may also be too pricey for many consumers. A report released Monday by Consumer Intelligence Research Partners in Chicago said the cheapest Echo product, the $50, hockey puck-shaped Dot, has accounted for more than half of the estimated 10.7 million Echo devices sold since 2014.

Sign Up Plus Apple, maker of beautiful products even when they aren't hits, potentially could leapfrog the Show. In a recent research note, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said Apple may debut an Echo rival next month at the company's annual developer's conference. Apple employees have been testing a device at home for several months, according to people familiar with the matter. While marketing chief Phil Schiller recently talked up the benefits of having a screen on a voice-activated device, it's not clear whether the Apple version will in fact have one.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Smartphones iPhone for just Rs. 15,000? True, but only for online shoppers This is the first time that the price of an iPhone is going to start at Rs. 15,000 in India. Sami Khan   May 9, 2017 19:55 IST iPhone 5s to get cheaper in IndiaReuters If you have been secretly trying to buy an iPhone for a while but the high price tag that comes with it has forced your hands to rest, it's time to get ambitious again. Apple is looking to strengthen its online presence in India by making its oldest smartphone model available exclusively online. As an incentive, the company will make sure buyers won't have to dig deep into their pockets. According to three industry executives, Apple has reportedly initiated the process of making its four-year-old iPhone 5s an online-exclusive model. The offline retail stores have reportedly been educated on Apple's plans, which also include an aggressive pricing strategy to attract online shoppers. If the report holds any truth, the iPhone 5s will be priced at around Rs. 15,000, which is Rs. 3,000 lesser than the current selling price. This would leave Apple's iPhone SE as the entry-level model in the offline retail stores in India, which is priced at around Rs. 20,000. "Apple wanted to have one iPhone model with an aggressive pricing in India and was banking on the company-certified refurbished models. But now that the proposal has been struck down by the government, it is betting on the iPhone 5s," one of the executives told the Economic Times. Apple has been trying to convince the Indian government to give the company a go-ahead to sell refurbished iPhones in India for a lower price. The company's plans were met with strong resistance from local manufacturers and environmentalists, who feared India might turn into a "dumping yard" and open a gateway for other international brands to do the same. Since Apple's plan to sell pre-owned iPhones in India did not work out as planned, it seems logical to opt for aggressive marketing strategies. By making one iPhone model exclusive to online stores, Apple still has a large potential to tap into the market as 50-55 percent of its iPhone sales in India are through online channels. By setting up a base price of Rs. 15,000 for an iPhone, Apple will be able to compete with lucrative OEMs including Xiaomi, Lenovo, Motorola, OPPO, Samsung and others. The Rs. 15,000-Rs. 20,000 price bracket for smartphones is quite successful in India, witnessing a whopping 158 percent increase in January-March quarter, ET reported. In comparison, the Rs. 20,000 to Rs. 30,000 price range, where Apple's iPhones currently fall, expanded just 10 percent. Apple's commitment towards the Indian smartphone market has increased tremendously. The company is setting up a development centre in Hyderabad and also an assembly unit in Bengaluru. Local manufacturing is also expected to give Apple at least 10 percent pricing advantage, which might translate to cheaper iPhones in the future. Apple hasn't announced the new price for its iPhone 5s, but we expect that to happen soon.
