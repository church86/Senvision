Poor old Sharakat quite rightly thought it was a joke or some spam at first, with Apple telling him that his surname was on a Denied Parties list operated by the US government, which meant special care has to be taken to make sure he isn't a terrorist or a dead overseas dictator from the 1980s and 1990s who's shaved off the beard and is hiding out in Birmingham. It was apparently a human error that caused Hussain to be mistaken for Hussein, although you'd think what with the spelling and the fact that one of them was executed on the news several years ago, it'd be really quite hard for someone who made it through Apple's recruitment processes to make such a mistake. Apple explained the error to the Independent, saying: "We offer our sincerest apologies to Mr Hussain. Though we are required to check identity while processing a refund, the letter he received was an error and should not have been sent." [The Sun via Independent] Want more updates from Gizmodo UK?

After weeks of trying to get used to the iPhone 7's new haptic home button, you've simply had enough. Instead of forging on, you decide to get in contact with Apple and kindly ask for a refund - relieved that your nightmare will soon be over. But then, disaster, as you're hit with the routine, "Listen, can you prove you're NOT actually dead Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein before we sort that refund?" Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Wait, what? Yes, whether trolling or not, this was a reason Apple recently gave a customer a refund refusal. ©  Digital Spy That was after Sharakat Hussain, a 26-year-old from Birmingham, decided to refund the device after buying it for his sister. A few weeks later, he received an email back from the Cupertino giant curious to know if he was actually that guy who was executed on live television around a decade ago. Hussain - y'know, the one who's alive - naturally thought the email was spam before checking out the request further and being informed that his surname was actually on the government's Denied Parties list. The process was triggered by a requirement to check large refunds against the international sanctions list, with a human error resulting in Hussain being mistaken for, well, the former president of Iraq, despite clearly spelling their names differently. GIF ©  NBC Universal Warner Bros "We offer our sincerest apologies to Mr Hussain. Though we are required to check identity while processing a refund, the letter he received was an error and should not have been sent," an Apple spokesperson told The Independent. Apparently, no impossible ID checks will now be necessary and the refund will go through as normal. All's well that ends well... kind of. Want up-to-the-minute entertainment and tech news?

The bad news is that there's no word on when it's coming out. The TechCrunch report alleged to have talked to a spokesperson from Apple who claimed that the company needs "a little more time" to perfect the Apple AirPods before the release date.  "The early response to AirPods has been incredible," the alleged spokesperson said. "We don't believe in shipping a product before it's ready, and we need a little more time before AirPods are ready for our customers." Apple only created the hype when it unveiled the AirPods during the launch of the iPhone 7 on Sept. 7. It was billed to be the solution to the company's vision to become wireless. Apple ditched the 3.5mm audio jack on the smart phone and instead installed a Lightning connector for charging, as well as Bluetooth headphones. Sponsored Watch Your Favorite Christian Films, 24/7. Click Here To Start Your Free Trial Today Some tech articles noted the unsightly design of the earphones. TheNextWeb called it as "extremely ugly." WIRED had some funny descriptions on the earphone such as similar to "wearing a toothbrush in your ear," or similar to an earbud "melting down the side of your face," or a tiny hair dryer. But Apple diehards are willing to give the AirPods the benefit of the doubt. That's because there's another feature of the Apple AirPods that's unlike any other: it can also synch with the Apple Watch or the iMac as long as they are within range. When the Apple AirPods release date will be announced, buyers can order it for a price of $159.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple The Mac faithful are still complaining about the MacBook Pro Yoni Heisler •October 31, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share It's been a few days since Apple unveiled its revamped MacBook Pro and the frustration surrounding Apple's alleged disregard for its core users is still palpable. Despite a thinner and lighter form factor, an improved display, moderately enhanced internals and, of course, the ballyhooed Touch Bar, there seems to be large contingent of Apple users -- primarily creatives professionals and developers -- who remain unimpressed if not downright upset. DON'T MISS: This is the most stunning iPhone 8 mockup yet, and it might be accurate Late last week, we touched on a number of these complaints, many of which lamented the fact that Apple's new MacBook Pros could should feature more advanced internals and an option to upgrade to 32GB of RAM. While some of these complaints about Apple's new notebooks are not without merit, some have even take a broader stance that Apple simply has no idea what it's doing in the Mac space and is actively neglecting some of its more loyal users. Touching on this, Owen Williams over at Medium argues that Apple doesn't even know who the Mac is for anymore. But the “Pro” in Apple’s devices isn’t even accurate anymore. It used to be the best notebook on the market for creatives, developers and people with big requirements. Apple’s customers are those that need powerful machines, but it delayed them infinitely for what amounts to a vanity project that the core demographic of Apple’s customers probably won’t even use. ... Apple, it seems, is angling for the ‘amateur creative’ and isn’t interested in anything else anymore. It wants the market that sits in coffee shops with its brand and only buys Apple, but doesn’t mind so much if the core demographic disappears. Maybe that’s OK — there’s probably good money in it — but it’s a real shame. It's an interesting and not altogether invalid point. Indeed, going back to how Apple completely overhauled iMovie many years ago -- as a quick example -- the notion that Apple cares more about 'amateur creatives' than it does with bona fide professionals perhaps shouldn't come as too much of a surprise. Meanwhile, Milen Dzhumerov writes: This one-size approach has fundamental flaws because we haven’t reached the stage where the tradeoffs are acceptable to high-demanding professionals. Almost every choice we make in this life is all about tradeoffs: it’s the same in hardware engineering. For example, making laptops thinner and lighter means sacrificing performance that you wouldn’t if you did not have those constraints. ... The counterargument that I’ll make is that if you lose the professionals, you’ll lose a significant chunk of innovation and content that keeps consumers in the Apple ecosystem. Those professionals are content creators and if they use Macs at work, they’re more likely to use Macs at home and create for Apple platforms. Professionals are influencers and affect the computing choices of their immediate family & friends. The last point, about the influence wielded by creative professionals, is particularly interesting and worth pondering. Suffice it to say, this isn't a debate that will die down anytime soon.

One week after releasing the iOS 10.1 update and more than a month after launching the iOS 10 operating system, Apple has seeded iOS 10.2 to developers. Apart from new emoji and wallpapers, it brings bug fixes, performance improvements, new camera settings, and more. Registered developers can download the iOS 10.2 beta from the Apple Developer Center or over-the-air with the right configuration profile installed. While the last update, iOS 10.1, introduced a new Portrait photography mode for the iPhone 7 Plus' dual-lens camera system, the new features in iOS 10.2 aren't as major. But they're still noteworthy nonetheless. Unicode 9 emoji are included in iOS 10.2, which means you'll get emoji for shrugging, clown face, drooling face, selfie, fox face, owl, shark, gorilla, butterfly, avocado, and pancakes. Go here for the full list of new Unicode 9 emoji 9to5Mac There are also new wallpapers in iOS 10.2. They use the same graphics found in the iPhone 7's marketing materials. There's even a new option for saving your last-used camera settings, meaning you can preserve the last Camera Mode, Photo Filter, or Live Photo setting. The Preserve Settings option can be located in the Settings app under Photos & Camera. Other features include a new widget available for the Videos app (you can access this widget on the widgets panel; it displays movies and TV shows in the Videos app) and an emergency contacts feature that will automatically notify your emergency contacts when you use the Emergency SOS. Check out Pocket-lint's iOS 10 tips and tricks round-up to see what else you can already do with Apple's mobile operating system.

"I think the challenge that Apple has here is it's really hard to become the front end when you don't have the services that people watch," Hargreaves said. "And without Netflix and Amazon ... as part of that app, I don't think anybody's going to tune in." Apple on Thursday revealed a new app, TV, that works across multiple devices. A TV Guide-like app for streaming, it aggregates shows from multiple service providers into a single app, making them searchable by Siri, and enabling recommendations from across users' different subscriptions. While it solves Apple TV issues like finding live sports games, it has a major downside: It does not aggregate Netflix or Amazon shows from the respective apps, Hargreaves said, and those services are already the home screen for a significant number of users. "Given where we are now, there's still time for them to have an effective video strategy," Hargreaves said. "It just has to be something different. It has to be their own service and something with scale." The new app comes as functions like Siri and iMessage increasingly provide an alternative to opening individual apps on other Apple devices. But unlike when Apple released the iPod along with iTunes, or the App Store with iPhone, Hargreaves said he doesn't see Apple TV as meaningfully different than other hardware devices. "The challenge with the TV box is it's really a commodity business," Hargreaves said."I would argue that their box is no better, and maybe even worse in some cases, than a Roku." In a recent conference call with investors, Apple CEO Tim Cook addressed the company's content strategy, after The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple had approached Time Warner earlier this year. "I would confirm that television has intense interest with me and many other people here," Cook said. "In terms of owning content and creating content, we have started focusing on some original content ... we've got a few things going there. I think it's a good opportunity for us. It is an area that we're focused on." Any success in video "would be upside" for Apple, Hargreaves said. But in a research note, he wrote their current strategy needs a "reboot." "I find it pretty funny how many people have been calling for a-la-carte TV, including [Apple CEO] Tim Cook, and are now wanting all those apps to be put back together into one point of interaction, or 'guide,'" Hargreaves wrote. "The big cable bundle has been successful for a reason." Disclosure: As of the date of this report, Pacific Crest makes a market in Apple shares.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « IDC: Apple Continues to Dominate the Tablet Market Worldwide in Q3 2016 | Main | Foxconn Gets the Green Light from Apple to Test Wireless Charging Module for their Top 2017 iPhone Models » October 31, 2016 BlackBerry Wins First Major Automaker Deal with Ford for QNX Operating System, a System Apple is Gunning for   It's being report this afternoon that BlackBerry Ltd. has signed a deal to work directly with Ford Motor Co to expand the carmaker's use of its QNX secure operating system, the Canadian technology company said on Monday, as Ford develops increasingly automated vehicles.   The deal with Ford is the first BlackBerry has done directly with a major automaker, though it currently sells its technology to auto industry suppliers.   Panasonic Automotive currently uses QNX software in the Sync 3 infotainment console that it supplies to Ford.   BlackBerry is hoping the new deal will expand use of BlackBerry's software in Ford vehicles as the two companies identify other systems where it might be used.   "We can form the basis of the entire vehicle all the way from autonomous drive through to infotainment," John Wall, the head of BlackBerry's QNX unit, said in a phone interview. For more on this story read the full Reuters report here.   When BlackBerry was the leading smartphone in the world, Apple hired some of BlackBerry's engineers and before you knew it, it was ballgame over for BlackBerry who got blindsided with iOS, the iPhone and the 'app economy.' And if BlackBerry doesn't wake-up Apple will do it to them again. If they had any brains they should be suing Apple for poaching some of the core engineers, but they haven't.   Earlier this month Patently Apple posted a report titled "Apple's Canadian Office is Focused on Developing carOS." We noted in that report that in January we reported that Apple was to open a new Canadian Office in Automotive Industrial Park in Ottawa. Ottawa has a major presence in the automotive software sector. Kanata Research Park is already home to BlackBerry's automotive division, QNX Software Systems, which recently unveiled a slate of new software for the rapidly evolving driverless car market. That was an interesting development for Apple in context with their Project Titan and developing car systems.   Bloomberg reported this month that Apple was aggressively chasing top QNX talent. More specifically they noted that "Apple Inc. has dozens of software engineers in Canada building a car operating system, a rare move for a company that often houses research and development projects close to its Cupertino, California headquarters, according to people familiar with the matter.   Many of the engineers working in Canada were hired over the past year and about two dozen came from BlackBerry's QNX, a leading automotive software provider.   Apple purposely targeted QNX employees because of their experience developing fundamental components of operating systems and power management, a former QNX executive said.   Bloomberg reported in July that "Dan Dodge, who founded QNX in 1982, and stayed on after BlackBerry bought the company in 2010, left QNX at the end of 2015 and joined Apple in July to work on autonomous vehicles.   While Apple licenses QNX for CarPlay, it's known that Apple likes to own every part of a system whenever possible and so it's no surprise that they parked themselves next door to the QNX facility in Ottawa to grab all the talent that they could get. While we'd like to think that Apple is innovative at everything, they certainly have no problem grabbing as many core engineers from QNX as humanly possible to help them build a competing product. Is Apple guilty of slavishly copying aspects of QNX? Well, they're hiring QNX engineers for a clear reason.    In the end, BlackBerry better run with the wind and gain as many new long term deals as they can with car companies before Apple makes a run at their "new market" with carOS (or whatever they call it). Apple robbed them blind with the iPhone so there's no reason for them to say that they got blindsided again. Apple has made their intentions very clear. Apple is coming for your market. So don't fall asleep at the wheel this time around BlackBerry or recent history will repeat itself. It's really that simple.    About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

The article is called The real reason why Apple hyped Touch Bar and is located at http://www.starkinsider.com/2016/10/real-reason-apple-hyped-touch-bar.html. Captcha Submit CLOSE Culture Tech/SV Wanderlust Interviews Video Features Culture Tech/SV Wanderlust Interviews Video Features Tech & Silicon Valley The real reason why Apple hyped Touch Bar By Clinton Stark - 10.31.2016 Interesting thing this Touch Bar. Apple’s replacement of function keys with a dynamic OLED strip that can change based on what you’re working on, is certainly unique. If you want, it can be just a standard Apple MacBook function strip featuring the usual controls: screen brightness, volume and music controls… and, yes, an escape key. But it looks like its real usefulness when come when you, say, open Adobe Lightroom. Then — if third party developers such as Adobe have done their work — a specific set of softkeys dedicated to the task at hand will show up on the Touch Bar. Done right and we’d need to rely less on memorizing keyboard shortcuts. Or diving deep into menus. By now, many have cited Apple’s Touch Bar as nothing more than baby steps towards the inevitable: that eventually Apple will relent, and build a full touchscreen version of the MacBook and its operating system. Just like Microsoft has been doing for a few years now (and rather well too) with Windows 8 and now, especially, with Windows 10 and inking and hybrid 2-in-1 laptop/tablets. I recently wrote about Apple and Microsoft’s divergent philosophies when it comes to touch (Apple prefers we touch a Touch Bar instead of a screen), and I believe Team Redmond might be moving the needle with their recent innovations. The new Apple?! It’s too early to tell if the Touch Bar (and Touch ID) will go down as a smash hit or a flop. The new 2016 MacBooks with the new strip aren’t yet shipping. But here’s my theory as to why Tim Cook and team spent so much time at last week’s announcement and slick presentation hyping the Touch Bar… Foot traffic. It’s all about getting foot traffic… into Apple stores. To generate that traffic you need something interesting. Something that will draw us away from our desks and couches to try it out. Apple’s been doing this for years. Whether it’s the new iPad, or the Force Touchpad, or the Apple Watch, something shiny and cool (and possibly gimmicky) needs to headline a major product reveal so that we immediately make plans to march down to the nearest Apple store to try the thing out. Touch Bar on a MacBook Pro. Gimmick or useful feature? Apple hopes you’ll head to one of its stores to test it out. The Touch Bar is perfectly suited to draw foot traffic. It’s colorful. It’s touch-y of course. And it’s also controversial. On that last point, many of us will want to “try it out” before making a decision whether to spring for a Touch Bar-enabled MacBook, or perhaps opt for the lower priced MacBook without it. Or, as some of us are considering, even switching to a Windows-based laptop (Surface Book?). Tech & Silicon Valley on Stark Insider The Future of Brands: Content simply isn’t living on islands anymore Laptop Dilemma: Surface Book or MacBook Pro? Apple prefers we touch a Touch Bar instead of a screen 5 reasons why the smartwatch market took a dramatic nosedive Should I upgrade to a Canon EOS 80D or should I switch to a Sony mirrorless camera (a6500)? I’m on the fence as to the utility of the Touch Bar. It seems to me to be a solution looking for a problem. I suspect I’d end up leaving it set to its default setting. Then it would operate just like a plain old strip of function keys. That way I can easily adjust all the things that need constant baby-sitting: volume, brightness, keyboard lighting, etc. Then, if that’s all I need to do, why bother spending an extra $300 for the Touch Bar? That Apple has generated so many headlines about the Touch Bar is, likely, considered a minor victory in and of itself by those in Cupertino. Now Tim Cook is betting that curiosity will translate into foot traffic. Then it will be all about conversion. As usual. A MacBook Pro would be ideal. But there’s plenty of other, far lower priced goodies in the Apple store. Instead of dropping $2,499 on a 15-inch MacBook Pro, all of a sudden that $1,000-ish iPad Pro looks like a steal. It’s all relative. And it’s definitely a bit of guarded marketing genius. Bottom Line Regardless of whether or not the Touch Bar itself drives MacBook sales, it’s done its job: it’s generated headlines, and it’s going to generate foot traffic to local Apple stores across the country (and world).

Users of the Cupertino giant’s smartwatches are saying that version 3.1 actually helped improve the battery life of their wearables. PhoneArena has learned that a very important improvement that Apple forgot to include in the update’s changelog is the boost in the devices’ battery life. Owners of the Apple Watch Series 1 and Apple Watch Series 2 are reportedly sharing online that watchOS 3.1 improved the timepieces’ fuel to make them last for up to two days on just a single charge. If watchOS 3.1 is indeed improving the battery life of Apple’s smartwatches, then users won’t have to worry about refueling their wearables every night. Before, recharging the devices every night is needed to ensure that they will have enough battery to last the following day through. Related Stories Is Apple Discontinuing The iPad Air Series? LG's New UltraFine Displays Are Perfect For The New MacBook Pro Surface Book vs. MacBook Pro 2016 — Which Is Better? According to MacRumors, a user has taken to its own online forum to express that after updating the Apple Watch to watchOS 3.1, the device still maintained around 75 percent of battery sixteen hours since it was last connected to a charger. The same user stated that the device had longer battery life though location services were turned on. There are also users who are claiming that their wearables even lasted the entire weekend with the new software update. One specifically pointed out that the Apple Watch 2 lasted from 5 a.m. Friday through 7 p.m. Sunday on just a single charge. Unfortunately for owners of the Original Watch (Series 0), their dated smartwatches do not get the same boost in battery the newer devices are currently enjoying. Some users of the original series are even claiming that instead of improving battery life, the update caused it to get a little worse. Previously, IBTimes reported that watchOS 3.1 came with bug fixes, subtle changes found in the Messages app and enhancements on certain features, like Force Touch.

Apple has unveiled the latest in the MacBook Pro series. The company has showcased two 13-inch models alongside a 15-inch unit. Both of these MacBook Pros are compatible with Apple’s newfangled Touch Bar feature, an OLED multi-touch bar that adapts to the application at hand. There were rumblings of such a feature leading into the event, and on that front, Apple did not disappoint. Related: Apple’s new MacBook Pro has an OLED Touch Bar that changes with your apps The new model is the lightest and thinnest MacBook Pro to date in an all new, sleek entirely aluminum design. The latest device is loaded with new features and an outstanding display, but should you upgrade from your old MacBook Pro for the newer model? Here’s a rundown of specs and features to help you decide if you should make the leap. MacBook Pro 13-inch (with Retina) MacBook Pro 13-inch (with Touch Bar) Dimensions  12.35 x 8.62 x .71 (in) 11.97 x 8.36 x 0.59 (in) Weight  3.48 pounds 3.02 pounds Processor  5th-generation Intel Core i5 or i7 6th-generation Intel Core i5 or i7 RAM  8 or 16GB LPDDR3 up to 16GB Display  13.3-inch IPS display 13.3-inch IPS display Resolution  2,560 x 1,600 2,560 x 1,600 Storage  128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB 256GB, 512GB, 1TB Touch Bar No Yes Ports  USB 3.0, Thunderbolt 2, HDMI, Headphone jack, SDXC 4 x USB-C (Thunderbolt 3), any can charge; 1x 3.5mm headset Webcam  720p FaceTime HD 720p FaceTime HD Operating System MacOS Sierra MacOS Sierra Battery  74.9 watt-hours 49.2-watt-hour lithium-polymer battery Price $1,299+ $1,799 Review 4.5 out of 5 stars Hands-on Specs The new MacBook Pro 13-inch will include the 6th-gen dual-core i7 processor, which is a modest upgrade from the 5th-gen i7 available with the previous MackBook Pro. Sadly, Apple chose to not use the latest available 7th-gen Core hardware with the new MacBook Pros, because there no Kaby Lake mobile chips with Iris Pro graphics, which help in powering the high-resolution display. Nonetheless, the newer model is still more efficient, with higher performance capacity than the previous model. This means those who like to run multiple apps at once will surely appreciate the modest, albeit welcome, upgrades. The older MacBook Pro and the latest model also both tout 16GB of RAM. Display Thankfully, Apple did not sacrifice ingenuity for its ultra-thin, 0.88-millimeter display. According to Apple, the latest MacBook Pro uses the best Retina display the company has ever put in a notebook. The new MacBook Pro is 67 percent brighter than the previous generation (500 nits), and features more contrast and a wider color gamut (P3) as well. Larger pixel aperture and high-efficiency LEDs also enable the new device to consume 30-percent less power than its older counterpart. Resolution, however, is the same on the previous-gen MacBook Pro as the forthcoming model — 2,560 x 1,600. Portability As with any laptop, portability is the name of the game. This crucial component was, in large part, key to the initial popularity of the MacBook Air. The latest MacBook Pro is the lightest and thinnest MacBook ever created. The new model is a mere 14.9-millimeters thick and weighs just 3 pounds, rendering it 17-percent thinner with 23-percent less volume than the last-gen MacBook Pro, for the 13-inch model. But there is a potential disappointment lurking in the new MacBook Pro. The battery is much smaller. The MacBook Pro 13’s battery has decreased from 74.9 watt-hours, to 49.2 watt-hours (in the Pro with Touch Bar).  Apple claims battery life is identical to before, at 10 hours, despite the change. Design As noted in the previous section, the latest MacBook Pro is thinner and lighter than the last-gen model. The new model also utilizes a redesigned, aluminum unibody. This eliminates the exterior plastic present on previous models, including the oh-so-popular Apple icon on the back, which is now a sleek engraving. The most innovative addition to the new model is, without a doubt, the Touch Bar feature. As previously mentioned, the Touch Bar is a customizable display that’s located at the top of the keyboard . It responds to multi-touch gestures and is also context-sensitive with regards to any running applications (assuming they’re compatible). The tool allows you to adjust the volume and brightness, among other basic tasks, and can even carry out more sophisticated tasks related sound mixing and image editing. The Touch Bar can be customized on a user-by-user basis, too, meaning you can add emojis to the display or a host of your favorite websites. It’s entirely up to you. The trackpad is also nearly 50-percent larger on the new MacBook Pro. Apple attributes the increase in size to its Force Touch technology, which is incorporated in the new trackpad. This cuts down on the rather cumbersome and design-hindering internal switch with the previous tracking module. To unlock the new MacBook Pro, you merely need to use the new Touch ID feature integrated into Touch Bar. This is a feature iPhone and iPad users have grown accustom to over the years, and it’s a welcome addition. Once you’ve set your fingerprint with the device, you can unlock the Mac and switch between accounts with ease. This feature also lets you securely make purchases on your MackBook Pro. Ports Few of the old ports were spared with the new MacBook Pro upgrade. With the latest model, Apple has done away with the MagSafe and HDMI ports, as well as the SD card slot and the Thunderbolt 2 ports. Considering Apple also chose to drop the standard USB port, you’ll probably need to a few adapters for connectivity purposes. These ports were replaced by four Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) ports, all of which can be used to charge your device and connect additional peripherals. Malarie Gokey/Digital Trends This will be a controversial change. It enhances flexibility in the long run, but also increase inconvenience right now. For example, all iPhone owners will need to buy an adapter to plug their iPhone into the new MacBook Pro 13, which seems…strange, to say the least. Availability and pricing The 13-inch, Touch Bar version of the Macbook Pro starts at $1,500, whereas the Touch Bar-equipped unit starts at $1,800. The model without the Touch Bar is currently available, but the Touch Bar version — and the 15-inch version thereof — is only available for pre-order, with a shipping estimate of three to four weeks. The previous-gen MackBook Pro 13-inch is still available for $1,299. Conclusion With the latest MacBook Pro 13-inch, Apple has created the most visually appealing unit in the entire MacBook Pro lineup. The new device is sleeker and lighter than previous MacBook Pros, namely because of the all-aluminum build. The Touch Bar appears to be a very handy tool, too, which will grant users greater flexibility when using a variety of apps. The addition of Touch ID was inevitable, and we’re glad it has finally arrived to shore up the login process and enhance security overall. With that said, many core aspects of the MacBook Pro 13 haven’t changed. The new model isn’t much quicker, doesn’t last any longer on a charge, and has a similar display. And it’s not clear if the Touch Bar will be an awesome addition, or a mediocre add-on. Our take? Upgrade if your Mac is already showing signs of old age. If it’s still going strong, then stick with what you have. The MacBook Pro 13 is a solid upgrade, but no key feature sticks out as a must-have.

Now you don't even have to type a line of code in order to launch a product on the App Store. This has been an exciting development and has enabled a whole new wave of creators to make products and launch them on the App Store. I was one of them. I don't know how to code, but I do have some design skills, and I wanted to see what it was like to create something for iOS and launch it on the App Store. So a few months ago I decided that I would make some sticker packs for iOS 10 – and that's what I did. I brainstormed possible ideas, started designing some stickers and ultimately ended up publishing Birthday Celebration Stickers and an app bundle which included World Flag Stickers and a few other country-specific flag stickers. The process of making and publishing these sticker packs was fairly straightforward, but I also encountered some unexpected hurdles. To help others who are excited about making their own sticker packs, I've written this guide, which I hope can make the process a little smoother. Table of Contents Sticker Pack Creation Basics Things You'll Need The Process, Simplified Sticker Packs and iMessage Apps Essential Reading and Viewing Important Notes and Limitations Generating Ideas My Experience Suggestions for Generating Ideas Design Choose a Size Designing Stickers Icons Xcode Starting the Project Add the iMessage App Icons Add the Stickers Testing Builds from Xcode Preparing for Publication Creating App Screenshots Making an App Preview Writing an App Description Publication Create the App in iTunes Connect Upload Build from Xcode Completing the App Store Information Uploading Screenshots and an App Preview App Review Miscellaneous Tips TestFlight Internal Testing External Testing App Bundles App Bundle Basics Creating an App Bundle in iTunes Connect Wishlist: Sticker Pack Improvements for Creators Basic Design Customization Options In-App Purchases Not Xcode & Simplified Submission Process Automatic Screenshot Generation Automated Copyright Infringement Checker Conclusion Sticker Pack Creation Basics Things You'll Need A Mac (to run Xcode). Xcode 8 – available for free. An image editor of some kind to create and save the images you'll use as your stickers. A paid developer account if you want to publish your sticker pack on the App Store. The Apple developer program costs US$99 per year. iMovie, or another video editing app, if you want to make an App Preview video of your sticker pack for the App Store. The Process, Simplified This is a lengthy guide, so here's the tl;dr version of what you'll need to do: Come up with an idea for a sticker pack. Design your stickers. Assemble your sticker pack in Xcode. Prepare your app for testing and distribution in iTunes Connect. Sticker Packs and iMessage Apps There is an important, but subtle, distinction between sticker packs and iMessage apps that can also offer stickers. iMessage apps require you to code, but sticker packs do not. This guide will focus solely on sticker packs where coding is not required – though it will still be useful to those who decide to go the extra mile and code other features. Essential Reading and Viewing You're already reading this article, which will be a good start, but you should also do the following: Read and bookmark Apple's API Reference document for Messages. It has some key information that is useful to refer back to. Watch Apple's iMessage Apps and Stickers WWDC 2016 videos – Part 1 and Part 2. Note that some of the information in those resources relates to iMessage apps. Even if you're just looking to create an iMessage Sticker Pack I'd recommend you still read/watch that, just so you have a better understanding of the limitations of iMessage Sticker Packs and the greater flexibility of an iMessage app. Important Notes and Limitations iMessage Sticker Packs are distributed on the iOS App Store. This means that you will need to have a paid Apple Developer Account and your Sticker Pack will go through the standard App Review process before it can be distributed. iMessage Sticker Packs must either be free or paid upfront. There is no option to use In-App Purchases (unless you create an iMessage App). The design of the sticker browser is not customizable, unless you create an iMessage App. You cannot add a caption to your stickers, though you can add a VoiceOver description for Accessibility. There are size limitations for the stickers (for both dimensions and file size), described below in the Design section. Stickers can be static or animated, or a mix of both. You can only edit your published iMessage Sticker Pack by submitting an update to the App Store. Generating Ideas My Experience The first step to making a sticker pack is to come up with some ideas. When I first decided to make some sticker packs, I started a note and just kept adding ideas to that note. At the moment there are around 22 ideas for sticker packs in there. Don't expect your first idea to be the one you ultimately ship, because you may realise it is too difficult to create, doesn't make commercial sense, or maybe you just think of a better idea. My first idea was to make a sticker pack of comic book effects like the BOOM! Wham! and BAM! I knew that making a high quality sticker pack of these effects was a bit beyond my (limited) artistic talents so I had some preliminary discussions with a few artists. I ultimately decided it probably wasn't worth investing too much time and money into it, and I could always come back to the idea later. I'm glad I made that decision because when the iMessage App Store opened, Cory Bohon also had the same idea and had created the fantastic Comic Talk sticker pack that was easily better than anything I could have done. In the end, I focused primarily on two sticker packs; World Flag Stickers and Birthday Celebration Stickers. World Flag Stickers was not particularly complicated once I had the source files for every country flag and set up a Photoshop action that created the necessary style and effect that I wanted. Birthday Celebration Stickers was much more difficult because it required me to create original artwork for every sticker. But one important idea that I realised was that if I design the artwork as a template, I could easily create color and style variations that would make the sticker pack larger and a better deal for customers. So you'll notice that I have 9 types of objects from candles to balloons and cupcakes, but because of all the variations I made, there are 151 stickers in total. A preview of Birthday Celebration Stickers. Suggestions for Generating Ideas My sticker packs have not been a roaring commercial success, so take all of these suggestions with a grain of salt, but I think they offer a good starting point for you to generate ideas for what sticker packs you might want to create. Have a look at the iMessage App Store. See what's already there and popular, but just as importantly, look to see what might be missing. Create a cute and charming character, and make it the focus. As an example, see The Little Fox stickers, Unicorn Stella, or Grumpy Spud. Make something whimsical and fun like the Pun Pals Sticker Pack or Comic Talk. Think outside of the box like Grammar Snob or Phoneys (even if it was ultimately pulled from sale). Here on MacStories we've also published two roundups of our favorite sticker packs and iMessage apps. You can read the first roundup here, and the second here. Design Choose a Size An important decision you need to make, preferably early on in the design process, is what size stickers to make. You have three choices: Small – 100 x 100 points @3x (300 x 300 pixels). Medium – 136 x 136 points @3x (408 x 408 pixels). Large – 206 x 206 points @3x (618 x 618 pixels). Whichever size you choose, you must ensure that the image files you create are at @3x. So if you choose to make your stickers large, the image files need to be 618 x 618 pixels. File Size Limitations Keep in mind that the file size of an individual sticker must not exceed 500 KB. This may seem like a lot, even for a large sticker, but it can quickly become problematic if you're making an animated sticker. For example, if your animation has 5 frames, then you only have 100 KB per frame. Designing Stickers I won't spend too long talking about the design of your stickers because this is where you have a huge amount of freedom. You can create hyper-realistic images in Photoshop, or you could sketch them on your iPad or even hand-draw them and scan them into your computer. You could use Pixelmator, Sketch, Photoshop, Illustrator, heck, even Microsoft Paint if you like. But here are some general tips: Remember the stickers will (most likely) be viewed on a small iPhone screen, so don't spend all your time designing the stickers on your 27-inch iMac at 300% zoom. Nobody wants a sticker pack with just a handful of stickers, so if it makes sense, be sure to create variations of your stickers. This allows you to make lots of stickers at a more efficient pace. If you're creating an animated sticker, do lots of tests to make sure the animation looks right. There are 151 stickers in my Birthday Celebration Stickers pack, and that's largely because I made heavy use of creating a core template for the key stickers and then making lots of color and pattern variations. Icons A very important part of your sticker pack is its icon. This is the first thing that most of your customers will see, so it needs to be good. Unfortunately, this can also be a very tedious task, because you need to provide 13 differently sized icons to Xcode and iTunes Connect. They will range in size from 58 x 58 pixels (used in iPhone Settings) to 1024 x 768 pixels for the Messages App Store. I use and highly recommend that you also use the fantastic Bjango App Icon Templates. This free resource contains templates for Photoshop, Illustrator, Sketch, and Affinity Designer which allow you to quickly create the different sizes of icons required. I can create all the necessary app icons very quickly with my modified version of the Bjango App Icon Templates. Xcode Starting the Project Starting your sticker pack in Xcode is fairly straightforward. When you open Xcode simply select "Create a new Xcode project" (if you don't see the Xcode welcome window you can also do this by File > New > Project). Xcode will then ask you to select a template for your new project. You should select 'Sticker Pack Application'. Then all you need to do is enter a product name for the project, select the relevant Apple Developer Account (if yours doesn't show up, you can enter it into Xcode's preferences) and provide an organization identifier (I just used my initials for this). Add the iMessage App Icons Now that we've created the Xcode project, its time to start adding our graphical assets, starting with the app icons. To add your app icons, simply click on iMessage App Icon in the sidebar of Xcode and you'll be faced with a screen that will have empty slots for all of the required app icons. If you've already created your app icons, you can simply drag and drop the entire set into the Xcode window and they will automatically be placed into the correct slot. This is what Xcode should look like once you've inserted all the app icons. Add the Stickers Adding your stickers is just as easy as adding the app icons – just drag and drop them into Xcode's window when you have the 'Sticker Pack' folder selected. Editing the VoiceOver Description for Accessibility By default, the name of your sticker's image asset will be used as the VoiceOver description. But you can override this in the Attributes Inspector which appears on the right hand side of Xcode. Just type your preferred description/name in the Accessibility field. Animated Stickers If you have created animated stickers by designing assets for each frame of the animation, you can also add these to Xcode. The only difference is that rather than just dragging them into Xcode, you'll want to first instruct Xcode to create a 'New Sticker Sequence'. Then you can add each frame to the sequence. Testing Builds from Xcode As you create your sticker pack in Xcode you'll want to see it in action and test it. You can do this in two ways, either through the Xcode Simulator, which can emulate various iOS devices on your Mac, or on one of your own devices. All you need to do is select the relevant device, whether it is a device in the Simulator or a real device connected to your Mac, and click the Run button. Note that if you want to run a build on your own device, you will have to go through some initial setup to add that device to your Apple Developer Account. Put simply, you need to register your device in the Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles page of your account. To do this you need to enter your device's UDID (which you can get from iTunes when you plug your device into your Mac). For more information on this process, see this article from Apple. Preparing for Publication Creating App Screenshots You can upload up to 5 screenshots for your app (for each device size), and in most cases you should be taking full advantage of this. The entire reason that people will download your sticker pack is based on what your stickers look like. Screenshots are the easiest way to sell your sticker packs to a potential customer. So take your time to get good screenshots that shows off your sticker pack. The CARROT Sticker Pack is a good example of what you can achieve if you invest some time in crafting your app screenshots. As you can see below, the first screenshot is more of a promotional image, but that's fine – and it is probably more effective than a standard screenshot. In the second image we see the sticker browser, but also some of the stickers in the actual iMessage thread. Finally, in the third (and fourth) screenshot, we see the sticker browser in its full-screen view, which allows you to preview more of the stickers. Tip: Clean Status Bar If you're taking screenshots on an actual iOS device, you should take the time to clean the status bar so that it isn't a visual distraction. Doing so is easy; just plug your device into a Mac, launch QuickTime, create a New Movie Recording, and change the camera input to the iOS device that is connected to your Mac. Now when you take a screenshot, your status bar will say 9:41 AM, have full battery and wireless indicators, with no carrier text. Making an App Preview App Previews are Optional You do not need to create an App Preview, and particularly for stickers, the screenshots you upload will probably be a good enough preview for your potential customers. However, it certainly can't hurt to create an App Preview, and it may be useful. Plus, if your sticker pack is animated, a video is the only way your potential customers can see what the animation looks like. I created App Previews for some, but not all, of my sticker packs. They are extremely simple, but I think they give potential customers a decent preview of the stickers and how they might be used. Here's one of the App Previews I created: Recording your iOS Device's Screen We used QuickTime above to create a clean status bar, but this is also how you can create a screen recording of everything that happens on your iOS device. This is the easiest way to create a recording that we can use to make an App Preview for the App Store. Just make sure that you also change microphone input to your iOS device as well, as QuickTime does not automatically do this when you start recording an iOS device's screen. Change the input in QuickTime to record your iOS device and clean the status bar. Creating the App Preview in iMovie There are specific requirements for making an App Preview, detailed here. But iMovie makes it extremely easy. Simply launch iMovie and select File > New App Preview, this creates the project so that it will use the correct resolution and aspect ratio. Then it's just a matter of editing the video to create something compelling. Writing an App Description Although I think screenshots and even app previews are more important, particularly for sticker packs, you shouldn't ignore the app description. Don't spend hours fretting on the perfect wording, but you should take some time to craft an app description that could help convince a potential buyer to download your sticker pack. Most importantly, keep in mind that only a small amount of the app description will be shown. If you write a lengthy app description most of it will be hidden and require a further tap from the user, so convey the important information immediately and keep the less important items out of your opening paragraph. The App Store only shows a small preview of the app description, hiding the rest. Publication Create the App in iTunes Connect Login to iTunes Connect and select 'My Apps'. Then, using the + button in the top-left corner of the screen, create a 'New App'. You'll then be asked to complete a short form, which consists of the following questions: Platforms: Tick the iOS checkbox. Name: The name of your app, as it will appear on the App Store. It must be less than 50 characters and cannot be the same as another app on the App Store. Primary Language: Not particularly important for a sticker pack; just choose your primary language. Bundle ID: Using the dropdown menu, select 'XC Wildcard - *'. That will show a new text field called 'Bundle ID Suffix'. Go to your Xcode project and find the Bundle Identifier (see screenshot below), copy that and paste it into that 'Bundle ID Suffix' text field. SKU: This is just a unique alphanumeric ID that you need to provide to iTunes Connect. It is not shown on the App Store. For my apps, I have just used my initials followed by what number the app is. The first step to adding a new app to your iTunes Connect account. This is where you'll find your app's Bundle ID in Xcode. Upload Build from Xcode Important Note: You will not be able to upload your build from Xcode until you have created the app in iTunes Connect, as described above. Once you have created the app in iTunes Connect, you need to build your sticker pack into an app using Xcode. This can be done by setting the active scheme to "Generic iOS Device", and then selecting 'Archive' from the Product menu. When Xcode has built the archive, it will open the Xcode organiser window. Select the build you just created and click the "Upload to App Store" button on the right. If you haven't already logged into your Apple Developer Account in Xcode, you'll need to do so before Xcode can upload the build. Once you have uploaded the build to iTunes Connect, it may take a few minutes to show up, and a little bit more time for iTunes Connect to process it. Completing the App Store Information We're almost there. Now we need to prepare our app for submission to the App Store. Go back to iTunes Connect, find the app you created above, and under the App Store tab you'll notice a number of headers in the left sidebar. Below I've listed each of them, and the key information you'll need to provide. App Information The name of the app, as it will appear on the App Store. The category of the app. This should be Stickers, but you are free to choose the Subcategory. Pricing and Availability The price of the App. Technically, you're actually just selecting the price tier, and each tier corresponds to a price in each country that is roughly the same after currency conversions. If you'd like a more detailed explanation, read this article I wrote which explains how the pricing tiers work in more detail. Availability (you can restrict the app to certain territories if you choose). iOS App 1.0 Screenshots and App Preview (see below). App Description (see above for some tips). App Build (which is what you just uploaded from Xcode). Another app icon (1024 pixels x 1024 pixels) Age Rating. App Review Information. Version Release (choosing when your app is released). Uploading Screenshots and an App Preview You need to upload at least one screenshot of the iPhone, and one of the iPad. You should absolutely try to include a few screenshots. By default, you do not need to create screenshots for every device size. If you upload a screenshot from a 5.5-inch display (a Plus model of the iPhone), it can be used for every other smaller device. But you cannot use a smaller display screenshot on a larger display. The same is true for the iPad, which can use a 12.9-inch display screenshot for all smaller devices. So if you're looking to minimise the amount of work you need to do, take screenshots on an iPhone Plus and a 12.9-inch iPad Pro. If you don't own an iPhone Plus or the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, use Xcode's simulator to take screenshots of these devices. App Review Once you have completed everything in these 3 tabs, proofed it, and tested the latest build, you're ready to submit it for review. Just click the Submit for Review button in the top right corner of iTunes Connect and follow the final few prompts. App Review can be as quick as a few hours, to a week or more. But in recent weeks the average review time has been 1-2 days. You will be notified via email when the status of your app has changed from Waiting for Review to In Review and then Ready for Sale (approved). Miscellaneous Tips Screenshots in the Simulator If you don't have a Plus sized iPhone or a 12.9" iPad Pro, you might need to take your app screenshots in Xcode's device simulator. Simply press ⌘+S at any time and it will save a screenshot. But just be aware that you must be at 100% scale in order to get a full resolution screenshot. You can quickly toggle between various viewing scales by using ⌘+1 (1 being 100%, 2 being 75% and so on). Changing the Version & Build Numbers This one stumped me for days. Let's say you released your 1.0 sticker pack, but have since added more stickers and want to submit a 1.1 build. In Xcode you actually have to change this number in 2 places, because you have to change the app's version number, as well as the app extension's build number. Untitled Replay TestFlight As discussed above, you can test your sticker packs using one of Xcode's simulators, or even directly on your device via Xcode. But there's another way, which is via TestFlight in iTunes Connect. Once you've uploaded a build to iTunes Connect, you can distribute it for internal or external testing. Builds sent for internal or external testing are valid for 60 days. Internal Testing Internal testing is limited to those who have been added to your iTunes Connect account, whether they are have the Admin, App Manager, Developer, Marketer or Legal role. Distributing your app for internal testing does not require any app review process. To start internal testing go to the TestFlight tab, select Internal Testing. Then you just need to select the build you want to test, and which internal testers should be given access to the build. Once you've done that, just click 'Start Testing' and the internal testers will be sent an email, inviting them to install the app for testing via the iOS TestFlight app. External Testing External testing is similar to internal testing, except that you can send an invite to any email, not just those associated with your iTunes Connect account. However, another thing to keep in mind with external testing is that it is subject what Apple calls 'Beta App Review'. This process is different to App Review, so do not rely on an approval from Beta App Review as any kind of guarantee that your app will be approved by App Review. Because Beta App Review serves a different purpose, it is typically a little more efficient than the main App Review process – all my Beta App Reviews took less than 24 hours. You'll also have to provide some additional information prior to submitting a build for external testing, specifically: What to Test Beta App Description Feedback Email Marketing URL Contact Information Demo Account: Not applicable for a sticker pack, uncheck this box. Review Notes: A message to the review team at Apple, I just wrote "This is an iMessage sticker pack". Take time to properly answer the open-ended questions, but it is okay to keep them brief. My answers were brief and I had no issue with Beta App Review. App Bundles Another option you may want to consider is creating an App Bundle. App Bundles enable you to offer multiple apps to customers at a discounted price. I think this makes a lot of sense for sticker creators, and you can already see some great examples such as the Iconfactory's Emoji Pro Sticker Bundle. After making my World Flag Stickers app I got a number of requests for more flags for the US, Canada, and Australia. I didn't want to add them to the existing app, because that would make it more difficult to find country flags. So instead I decided to make seperate sticker packs for the US, UK, Canada, and Australia. I could then sell an app bundle which included all 5 of these sticker packs, at a good discount. So that's what I did with the World Flag Mega Pack. App Bundle Basics You can only create an App Bundle for your apps that have been approved and are 'Ready for Sale'. Any App Bundle you create will also go through a review process. You can include up to 10 apps in an App Bundle The App Bundle must be sold at a reduced price to what it would cost customers to purchase the apps seperately. If a customer has already purchased an app included in an App Bundle they will be credited for that purchase and will be able to purchase the App Bundle at a reduced price that accounts for the existing purchase. For more information this page on Apple's website provides a good overview of App Bundles. Creating an App Bundle in iTunes Connect Creating an App Bundle is a fairly easy task. Just remember that you can't add an app to an App Bundle until it has been approved and is 'Ready for Sale'. To start, log into iTunes Connect, go to 'My Apps', click the + button in the top-left corner and select 'New App Bundle'. You will then be taken to a screen which asks you to create a name for the App Bundle, and select the apps which will be part of the App Bundle. Then you'll be taken to another screen which asks for more information about the App Bundle. This is where you'll provide a description for the App Bundle, provide a marketing URL (optional) and select the price tier for the App Bundle. Remember that App Bundles must be sold at a discount compared to the collective price of the apps included in the bundle. Fortunately, iTunes Connect automatically calculates this and when you select a price tier it will indicate to you which price tiers are compatible and those which are incompatible. The 'Cleared for Sale' checkbox will mean your App Bundle goes live on the App Store when Apple approves it. iTunes Connect will indicate which price tiers are compatible for your App Bundle. Once you've entered all the required information, you can save and submit the App Bundle for review. This process took a few days for me, and it appears to be managed by a different team to the one that deals with other app reviews. Wishlist: Sticker Pack Improvements for Creators I started off this post by noting that the barrier to entry onto the App Store has never been lower. There's no doubt that's true, but I also think that there's a lot Apple can improve upon in iOS 11 that will make the process of creation, publication, and sale of sticker packs even easier and better for creators (and users). Basic Design Customization Options If you create a code-free sticker pack you only have one customization option for the sticker browser; whether your stickers are small, medium, or large. I'd like to see the ability for code-free sticker packs to also do things like: Add a search bar to easily find specific stickers; Change the background of the sticker browser; Add captions/names to stickers; Create folders or dividers to more easily separate different stickers within the same sticker pack. All of this is currently possible if you also do some of your own coding. So you'll notice that some sticker packs do, for example, have their own backgrounds for the sticker drawer. But it would be nice if some of these basic design customization options could be implemented without coding. In-App Purchases Also not possible with a code-free sticker pack are In-App Purchases. Your sticker pack has to be free or paid upfront. Whilst in some respects this is a nice return to the early days of the App Store, it also makes little sense when the rest of the App Store is today dominated by free apps that offer In-App Purchases. I'd like to be able to offer free sticker packs which come with "expansion packs" that can be purchased via an In-App Purchase. Not Xcode & Simplified Submission Process I know this is a big ask, but I genuinely think that the hardest part of making a sticker pack is dealing with Xcode. Using Xcode to make sticker packs is like using a 200 tonne road train when you move apartments – complete overkill and it actually complicates the process. So why not create a dedicated app for creating sticker packs? I'd also argue that the submission process for sticker packs in iTunes Connect could be simplified, but I think this is less of an issue. Automatic Screenshot Generation It would be truly fantastic if, at some point during the sticker pack creation process, Apple could automate the creation of screenshots for the App Store. Most sticker packs, mine included, take screenshots of the maximised sticker browser and use these as their App Store screenshots. Still give creators the option to create their own screenshots, but this would be a huge time saver and sufficient for 90% of sticker packs. Automated Copyright Infringement Checker It is an unfortunate reality that some people are stealing stickers created by others and packaging them in their own sticker packs for the App Store. Given that Apple has access to every sticker created, I'd imagine it should be possible to do an automatic image search during the app review process to see if any of the stickers are already included in another sticker pack. If the stickers do appear to be copied from another app, then it should be investigated by App Review. Conclusion Good luck creating your own sticker packs – it is a lot of fun and also quite rewarding to see your own work on the App Store when you're done. I hope this guide has been of some help to you, and demystified some of the more complex steps involved. Even at almost 6,000 words, there are still areas that I have glossed over or simplified by necessity.

As Zufi observes: People love reminiscing about the past, and there are still many Apple fans who love to celebrate the company’s rich product history — its successes and its failures. I’ve heard from readers who simply loved the fact that they sat down with [ICONIC and] a glass of wine and lost themselves for hours reliving these old machines, where they were in their lives when they first came across them, and how much has changed. That’s why Phil Schiller’s comment about not celebrating the past always bothered me and I’m going to disagree with Phil on this — I’m certain Apple will continue celebrating their past as they blaze the future. Selling the past short isn’t a prerequisite to embracing the future. Apple’s newfound willingness to look back feels like the mark of a mature company that’s as confident with where it’s been as it is with where it’s going.

The physical Escape key and function keys are gone, the traditional USB A and mini DisplayPort/Thunderbolt 2 ports are gone, the SD Card slot and MagSafe are gone, and the iconic startup chime is missing, too. It’s sad to see—or hear—the startup chime go, but it seems Apple has a reason for axing the sound. Apple drops the startup chime from new MacBook Pro models When Apple introduced the Mac, startup times were slow enough that the chime was an important signal to let you know your computer was really on and booting up. The new MacBook Pro models don’t have a traditional power button and instead turns on when you lift the lid. Playing the start up chime every time you lift the laptop lid would get old pretty quick, and considering how quickly our Macs start up, the chime doesn’t serve a useful purpose any more. That’s well and good if you can see your MacBook Pro’s display, but not if you can’t use your eyes. Hopefully Apple is giving the visually impaired some way to quickly tell if their MacBook Pro turned on and has started the boot process. The startup chime isn’t the only iconic feature to go away. Apple also ditched the glowing Apple logo from the laptop, which was probably necessary because of how thin the display housing is—a thinner lid means less space for extra stuff like glowing logos. It’s also possible the glowing logo let too much light leak through to the display, making a bright spot in its center. Still, losing the start up chime is a little sad. I mentioned on this week’s The iOS Show I hope a developer makes an app that plays the start up chime when the lid has been closed for at least an hour. Someone get on that.

Otherwise I am glad that the startup chime is fading away. In a quiet environment it can be as jarring as Chrysler Air Raid Siren. October 31, 2016 at 2:10 EST PM brilor October 31, 2016 Does anyone know if the new Mac Book Pro shuts down the machine when you close it( clam shell mode )? I’m wondering if it can be used with an external monitor but with the notebook closed. October 31, 2016 at 3:50 EST PM brilor October 31, 2016 Apple’s link explains for older Mac Book Pros ( https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201834 ) but I don’t want to assume for the current MBP. Thank you. October 31, 2016 at 3:53 EST PM vpndev October 31, 2016 Actually, the chime has a lot more reason for its existence than just to let you know that things are happening, despite the fact that the system is slow. It’s telling you that the initial self-test is OK. It’s not always the same sound! If certain things don’t work, the chime can tell you what the problem is. You can’t always rely on displaying an error message or alert because, for example, the video system (card, back then) might be fritzed. One of the Apple service docs has a list of the tones and what they meant. October 31, 2016 at 5:07 EST PM Lee Dronick October 31, 2016 It’s not always the same sound! If certain things don’t work, the chime can tell you what the problem is. Then it could chime in if there is a problem, but otherwise be silent. October 31, 2016 at 5:24 EST PM PSMacintosh November 1, 2016 I’m at my wits end with Apple’s constant “know-it-all” and “Apple knows what is best for EVERYONE else” attitude and approach. It would have been so simple to just make this matter–the startup chime–be a System Pref item. Make the default mode be OFF, but still allow a User to turn if ON if they want or need to for any reason. On my current (older) system, I have turned OFF the Startup Chime. I had to use some third-party software (that fooled with the Terminal?) to get it to happen. I like it off. I want it off. Apple should have built that feature into its System Prefs. Now they go and make it the other way: always OFF. Apple build the controls so that WE can make our own choice as to what we want OUR computers to do….and when. We know what is best for us!!!

According to the webpage, users are unable to sign in to a variety of services, including iCloud, the App Store, the iTunes Store, and iTunes U. Apple’s System Status webpage says the issues began just before 4PM ET and have yet to be resolved. It’s unclear how widespread the connectivity issues are, though Apple’s timeline depicts the outage in red for the iTunes Store, App Store, and iCloud. Though, the iTunes U outage is in yellow. The problems stem from signing into Apple’s cloud services. Users are still able to access the iTunes Store and App Store, but if at any point they’re asked to sign in, they won’t be able to. Apple also notes that the set up of a new iCloud account is also affected by this outage, as is signing into a service with your Apple ID (such as setting up a new device). Users may incorrectly receive an authentication error when attempting to use iCloud. Setting up a new iCloud account from an eligible device may be temporarily unavailable.

Roston - Oct 31, 2016 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Apple has released iOS 10.2 beta 1 for developers, something that follows the public release of iOS 10.1.1 earlier today. The latest dev beta is, of course, only available for those registered as developers; the download is available OTA or via the Apple Developer Center. Joining the new iOS 10.2 dev release comes macOS 10.12.2, watchOS 3.1.1 and tvOS 10.1, all of them also for developers. iOS 10.1.1 released: What you need to know The new iOS version brings new wallpapers, as well as new emoji pulled from Unicode 9 — these include such eclectic offerings as a fox, selfie, croissant, owl, avocado, shark and pancake, among others. More utilitarian is the ability to preserve your camera settings, including things like a particular mode, filter, or Live Photo. The new iOS dev beta also brings emergency contact notifications, which work thusly: if the Emergency SOS feature is activated in watchOS or iOS, anyone who is set up as an emergency contact will receive a notification informing them. Finally, at least as far as new features go, iOS 10.2 brings a new video widget for the system’s stock app. Swipe right from the Home or lock screen and you’ll see (via the widget) TV shows and movies that are available in the library. You can jump straight to a show by tapping it. Those new features aside, the release also brings various unspecified bug fixes and improvements.

National World Business Tech Sport Entertainment Life & Style Travel Motoring Profile Settings Sign Out technology Search Digital Living Gadgets Games Social Networking Apps BREAKING NEWS Live updates: Yesterday, you couldn't come to town, today you can't leave. Chaos in capital ... read more Google tries new approach with voice assistant Last updated 10:10, November 1 2016 Reuters Google released its Pixel phones last month. About six months ago, people working on hardware and the voice-activated Google Assistant for the Pixel phone started sitting next to each other at the company's headquarters, hammering out minute details of its first phone. The new seating arrangement illustrated a much larger shift underway at Google, which crashed Apple's smartphone revolution eight years ago by giving away its Android software and letting handset makers do the rest. Google software now runs on 85 per cent of the world's smartphones, but as voice control threatens to replace touch as the primary means of using a hand-held device, the company is experimenting with a different approach - more akin to Apple's tight integration of hardware and software. The Pixel's hardware and Assistant teams gather for happy hour every Friday and have already received a prototype for the camera on next year's phone, said Brian Rakowski, vice president of product for Google's Android operating system. READ MORE: * Living with gadgets that can talk * 'Iron Man' wants to voice Mark Zuckerberg's virtual assistant Their ambition: to make the company's voice-powered digital assistant better than rivals such as Apple's Siri and Microsoft Corp's Cortana. "We really wanted the Assistant on the phone to feel like a natural extension of the ways you ask Google for information," Rakowski said in an interview. LEAF FROM APPLE'S BOOK The fusion of hardware and software is key to that goal. Certain specifications are crucial for a high-performing assistant, such as a well-placed microphone and a powerful processor to crunch reams of data. Creating an app isn't enough; that requires a few clicks for users to get to it. Ad Feedback The hardware and software teams worked closely on details such as the graphics that appear when users call up the assistant, settling on a flurry of colourful dots, which Rakowski called a "whimsical touch to give a little bit of life to the home button." The Assistant is always at the ready on the Pixel phone and can be summoned by pressing the home button or saying the words "OK Google". By integrating the Assistant into the Pixel, Google "doesn't have to do negotiations with another handset maker - they can make it as tight as they want," said Charles Jolley, chief executive of Ozlo, which offers a digital assistant by the same name. To make sure users get the best possible experience, the Assistant will live only on Google products such as the Pixel, at least for now. In the long term, however, it is unclear whether Google will keep it that way, or return to its original phone strategy and try to push the product out to the millions of smartphones running on other manufacturers' Android phones, at the risk of offering a slightly lower-quality experience. Rakowski said making sure the Assistant works well on other phones would require a close level of integration with handset makers, beyond the typical work that happens on the Android operating system. "We want all these features of the Assistant to work well and work quickly and be nicely integrated so it gives the right idea of what the Assistant can do," he said "We don't want it to feel limited or bolted on in any way." He admits it could be challenging to execute the Assistant on some current Android phones. "You can't do some of the always-on 'OK Google' detection on some phones because they don't include the right hardware to do that," he said. "In some cases, the microphone is not in a great position." SAMSUNG GOING IT ALONE? Whatever Google decides, there are already some signs that its Assistant may not be welcome on all Android phones. Samsung, the world's top selling smartphone maker and the leading Android manufacturer, recently acquired Viv Labs, an artificial intelligence startup founded by the creators of Siri, and plans to weave the assistant into its phones. Having already ceded their operating systems to Google, Android manufacturers may be reluctant to delegate the digital assistant as well, people in the industry said. "If we get to the point where the face of the brand is the assistant itself, that is totally a differentiator," said Babak Hodjat, co-founder of artificial intelligence company Sentient. "They will be relegated to just pushing hardware." Google is coy about its plans. "Over time, we want to bring the Assistant to as many people as possible," Steve Cheng, product management director for the Assistant, said in an interview, without giving details. Analysts expect that eventually Google will try to make money by taking a share of transactions brokered by the Assistant - such as when a user buys flowers from a store the Assistant just located. Google chief executive Sundar Pichai appeared to hint at that possibility during the company's earnings call last week. "The Assistant team talked about conversational actions as a way by which we can integrate third parties into the voice experience," he said. But he did make clear, whether on its own or others' hardware, the shift from touch to voice-controlled assistants presents a prime opportunity for Google. "As we went from desktops to mobile, it's not like one replaced the other... It expanded the pie," he said. "I approach this the same way."  - Reuters Saved|Saved Stories Saved|Saved Stories Save|Saved Stories Save|Saved Stories Next Gadgets story: Review: MacBook Pro Technology Homepage technology headlines Consumer drone market slumps Review: Watch Dogs 2 Where did you go Kendall?

Apple’s Activity app on the iPhone recorded 499 active calories burned, just one active calorie shy of my daily goal, even though the Activity app on my Apple Watch showed my progress at just over 100%. It was an odd (and annoying) discrepancy that prompted me to think about how Apple’s Activity app could better handle different situations like sick days and harder to track activities. I proposed a new concept of rest days, tolerance levels, and an honor system that could help avoid losing achievement streaks and motivation. A lot of readers wrote in with similar stories and advice for correcting the data sync bug that I experienced. Now that we’re on the last day of the month (happy Halloween!), I can report that the recommendation I received from 9to5Mac readers was successful and worth passing along. First, some readers correctly pointed out that there’s already a concept of rest days in the Activity app … sort of. You can change your move goal for the current day from the Activity app on the Apple Watch. Just use Force Touch (press the display firmly) from the Activity section of the app to access the Change Move Goal option. If you get to the end of your day and realize you were under the weather that day and missed your workout routine, this lets you lower your move goal for that day without breaking your move streak. Just remember to change it back the next day or your much lower move goal will be much less effective at pushing you to do more activity. I was aware of this feature when I wrote my piece and still feel the same way now as when I suggested a rest day feature. The problem here is this feature is only meant to change your move goal for the current day, not retroactively, and it can’t be scheduled. I would go as far as to say that this feature is really for increasing your move goal mid-week (or lowing it if you second guess raising it when prompted from the weekly summary). You can read my original piece for more of my thinking behind what a rest days feature could do. But my situation was different. It was a syncing bug that broke my move streak, not the need for a rest day. I distinctly recall needing a specific number of calories to complete my goal, setting a workout to a higher number, then going a little further than that goal to make sure I didn’t miss it by a hair. Then the next day my iPhone said I missed it by a hair. The advice I received was really a hack but it worked (although I couldn’t be sure for three weeks). You could also use this method to cheat if actually break a move streak, but I don’t see any incentive to cheat as I wrote in my original post. The trick is to change the date on your iPhone, which changes the date on your Apple Watch, then burn some calories. You can do this from Settings → General → Date & Time → Toggle off Set Automatically. I was missing one active calorie from the day prior according to the Activity app on my iPhone, so I exercised for five minutes then saved the workout. Before I exercised, I also changed my move goal for that day to 490 just to try it all. The Workout app on the Apple Watch showed 0 calories burned when tracking, and the exercise minutes were added to the actual day versus the artificial day. Wonky! Then I corrected the date with the Set Automatically toggle from above, changed my move goal back to 500, and finished my workout for that day. It took a couple of days for the Activity app to acknowledge the move streak, but it picked back up with the correct number of days (which is motivating!). Since this was still new territory for me (that I don’t want to deal with again), I wasn’t sure if I’d receive the completion medal for that month. But here we are on the final day of the month and I’m happy to report back that it worked out 100%. The Activity app correctly records that my move goal for the date in question was 490, down from my regular goal of 500, but that doesn’t affect my move streak. I don’t expect I’ll ever have to employ this method again (and who knows how long it will work) considering the syncing bug was such an edge case, but give it a shot if you find yourself in the same situation. I still hope we see a more intentional rest days feature in future software updates (and no syncing bugs of course).

There's also new wallpapers, an option for saving last known camera settings, a widget for the Videos app, and a feature that'll automatically notify your emergency contacts when you use the Emergency SOS feature on the iPhone or Apple Watch.   After releasing iOS 10.1.1 to the public earlier today, Apple is now pushing a new beta update to registered developers. iOS 10.2 beta 1 is now rolling out to members of Apple’s developer program. If that’s you, you can get this update by going to Apple’s Developer Center or by grabbing it over the air if you’ve got the right configuration profile installed on your device. As for what’s included, we’ll have to wait a bit longer for developers to dig into this update and find out what’s new. Because this is a 10.x update and not a 10.x.x update, though, there could be a new feature or two included. For example, Apple added the iPhone 7 Plus’s Portrait Mode into the iOS 10.1 update that was released earlier this month. iOS 10.2 beta 1 isn’t yet available to public testers in Apple’s Beta Software Program, but if this is anything like other recent beta releases, that could change in the coming days.

Chris Mills •October 31, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Apple's newest MacBook Pros have got people all kinds of upset about the lack of ports, lack of graphics, or lack of a new MacBook Air. Those are all good points, but here's a little something to help dry your tears of Mac sadness: a $500 discount on the 12-inch MacBooks, which can snag you one of Apple's thinnest PCs for just $800. DON'T MISS: The iPhone 8 could have Apple’s most courageous feature yet B&H is having a serious sale on the 12-inch Retina MacBook. The version with a 1.1GHz Core M processor, 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage starts at $800. Considering that the old 13-inch MacBook Air has a worse screen, 128GB of storage and starts at $1000, that's a whole lot of savings. The $800 version is only available in space grey and silver, however, so no metallic pink for you. For $1,100 you can also go up to the 512GB storage version, which is available in all three colors. AppleCare is also an optional add-on for a $20 discount, which is nothing to sniff at if you're planning on having this laptop for a few years. The sale is being offered by B&H rather than Apple, so this isn't some kind of blow-out sale before it starts refreshing stock. But it is a good indicator that Apple is going to make some changes to the 12-inch MacBook in the upcoming months. Given the overhaul they just gave to the MacBook Pro, I wouldn't be surprised to see some of the changes like bigger trackpads and a better keyboard come over, if not the fancy Touch Bar.

Apple’s marketing on one slide. » How Apple could have avoided much of the controversy By chuq | Published Oct 31 2016 Here’s a basic reality: criticizing and second-guessing Apple is a hobby for many of us, and a profession for more than is probably healthy for the Apple ecosystem. That is a basic reality that isn’t going to change any time soon. I long ago got used the the idea that no matter what Apple said or released, the Internet would fall over itself proving how much smarter they were than Apple, only to see Apple make another truckload of money on the product everyone was criticizing. That said, this event’s criticism has been louder and more widespread and angrier than I remember seeing for a long time. I finally had to basically unplug for a while because I found myself getting into the “someone is wrong on the internet” mentality. Writing my piece over the weekend was about as difficult as anything I’ve ever written because there are a lot of legitimate gripe points with Apple right now, but so much of what’s being thrown around is trivial and petty and often outright wrong, or just plain silly. A lot of it boils down to this concept: We demand Apple innovate, but we insist they don’t change anything. No matter what, Apple loses. And as someone who watches this circus from my perch here in the Apple Ecosystem, I have to just recognize that, find the interesting and informed voices among the noise, learn from them and then move on. If I were Apple I’ve been thinking about how — if I were Apple — I’d try to minimize some of the pain and chaos going on with the users right now, while still being, well, Apple, who doesn’t roadmap the future and who really doesn’t like admitting there are problems or mistakes. Under the assumption that there are updated desktops coming after the first of the year, I think it would have made sense to mention that, just so users waiting for them can stop feeling abandoned. It doesn’t require a lot of disclosure, but I think it was time for at least some. So, later in the event, Phil brings up a single slide that says something like “More is coming soon”, and adds some color about what that means — updated iMac, a new Mac pro, and — dare we dream — an update to the Mini? Highlight some of the upcoming features, wide color, Skylake processors, USB C and thunderbolt 3, and perhaps even throw Intel under the bus a little bit over the reason they’re not shipping today. That would, I think, have muted a lot of the anger I’m seeing, without really giving away anything people couldn’t guess for themselves. What’s important here to me is that Apple acknowledges the cluster in the product line rather than proudly announce how great life is. Let’s Talk Mac Pro Speaking of clusters, let’s talk Mac Pro for a minute. I’ve come to the belief that the trash can Mac pro, the “Can’t Innovate my Ass” machine, is a product mistake of the “20th Century Anniversary Macintosh” caliber. It was a technological marvel, it was a stunning design, and it was a terrible piece of hardware for its primary audiences because of limited upgradability and component flexibility — and then Apple compounded that by not having good upgrade plans in place to refresh it since the design it created wouldn’t let its users do it for themselves. I’m convinced we’ll see not just an updated Mac Pro, but a new design, one that I hope backs away from some of the issues this design has. What I’m hoping for is in fact a new desktop product line which merges the Mini and the Mac Pro where, like the MacBooks, you have the options of 2-3 models each with 2-3 configuration upgrades which cover the pricing and processing needs from a basic Mac Mini to today’s Mac Pro supercomputer capabilities. I’m not convinced the Mini will survive this round of upgrades, but I do believe there’s a good niche for a basic desktop/server, and if it’s part of a consolidated product line (“meet the Apple Desktop!”) that’ll minimize investments in the product line because it can be shared across the configurations. Lets Talk Dongles People are having a field day talking about dongles and escape keys. Which is a bit like buying a new BMW and complaining about the color. The reality is, most might need a dongle or two but many people won’t need any. I bought three, mostly because I like keeping them in my travel bag for when I’m out and about, and in reality, 90% of their usage is by co-workers who forget to bring theirs to meetings, not by me. But hey, someone needs to think ahead. As has been pointed out by many, the escape key is still there, it’s just not a separate physical key any more. And in all honestly, almost nobody will care about that after having used the new device for a month and gotten used to it, and for the couple of percent of you who will insist on remaining upset about this change, I’m sorry. But you can always use the VT-100 you have in your office when it bothers you too much. I know when I buy a new car, I invariably have some accessories I need to buy because the ones I had with the old one aren’t correct for the new one — winter chains are always replaced, it seems. So if I’m spending $25-$30K on a car, spending another $100 on chains isn’t a big deal. But watch the nerds complain about a $19 thing to customize their $2500 computer. My short answer: time for a bit of perspective, people. In my case, my solution to all of the port changes is pretty simple: I bought a USB-C dock for the desktop, and a small one for the travel bag. When the new laptop arrives, I’ll unplug the Thunderbolt dock, replace it with the USB dock, plug it into the new Laptop, plug my Thunderbolt drive into the laptop with a dongle, and plug my existing USB hub into the new dock. Done. It really doesn’t seem that complicated or expensive. And in fact, USB-C docks are half the price of thunderbolt docks. Which makes them almost a no-brainer option for people using these new laptops at their workspace. So I’m going from two cables into the laptop (power and thunderbolt for the dock) to two cables into the laptop (USB-C/power and Thunderbolt). Lets Talk Niche When I wrote about this over the weekend, I was thinking and talking about niches a lot, and the more I think about it, the more I see this unhappiness as a battle to stay out of the niche — people want to be part of Apple’s mainstream, and where we see the biggest anger is groups of people who’s come to the realization that’s not true any more. The fact is, the Mac product line itself is becoming a niche product, because the days of the personal computer have started the shift back to where computers will be a hobby for the nerd and for the mainstream user, devices which use computers to enable tasks are starting to replace them: that includes tablets, but also gaming consoles and whatever it is that will ultimately take ownership of the living room. This is sad if you’re a computer nerd, but it means these technologies have gone mainstream and we have to remember most people aren’t interested for computers as computers, they are interested in solving problems, and use computers for doing that. And in many ways, a lot of the unhappiness I’m seeing about these new computers comes down to dealing with the realities of the Mac itself becoming a niche product to Apple, and of finding that your preferred use of the Mac is itself a niche within that niche, and one Apple may not see as central to the product itself any more. And that’s just reality; all the whining and moaning aren’t going to undo the market forces driving this. Apple is reacting to changes, not pushing them. But let’s talk about niches within niches for a minute. Lots of the complaints about dongles boil down to two things: they’re ugly (which is true) and they are features that should be built into the product. I can’t fix the first one, but to those arguing that Apple is just soaking users by forcing them to buy dongles, adding $40 to a $2500 product simply isn’t financially significant. And if you think about it, if Apple did see these are lucrative products instead of functional accessories, they’d make them a lot prettier. But the bigger issue around dongles is that niche thing again. These are accessories that allow specific customizations to the device that some people will want, but which most people won’t need. If you think about it, perhaps the biggest change from my older, 2013 laptop is that it’s gone from having seven (yes, that many) ports, each with a specific purpose to having four points, each customizable by a cable to dongle to solve the problem you have. My laptop has a power port, an SD card port, 3 Thunderbolt ports and two USB ports. I know that in the four years I’ve owned it, I’ve never used the SD card, I use the Power port, one Thunderbolt port, and occasionally plug a USB cable in. So half the ports in this thing are never used — and yet I paid for them because they were built into the computer. That’s the issue that defines dongles: Should 100% of buyers pay for a feature when only 5% of the owners will use it? Or 10%? How many users will need a feature before you think it ought to be required for everyone to buy it as part of the device? Where do you draw that line? One thing I’ve been pondering this weekend, but I couldn’t find any data on it: if Apple had to make a choice between including that SD card or including a VGA connector, which one should Apple do? Because I’d be willing to take a bet that more people use a VGA dongle twice a month than use that SD card twice a month on their existing machines. But the nice thing is that the ports on the new computer give you the options to have the capabilities you need, not the capabilities Apple thinks someone might need. And if you really think the dongles are ugly, I’m sorry — but there are also non-Apple options that are often cheaper, too. But dongles are very much a feature, not a bug. And four general purpose ports is, to me, a big upgrade over seven specialty ports. We need to remember that if they add all of those ports to the computer, you’re paying for them, whether or not you use them. And they all take power, they add complexity, and increase the chance of failure for the device as a whole. And it’ll end up looking like this. Lets Talk RAM There’s been a lot of criticism about the limit to 16Gb in these machines. As people have dug into it, it looks like this is another bundle of joy Intel has left on Apple’s porch for Apple to do the best it can with. One of the best looks at it is Rene at iMore: Why not throw power efficiency out the window and make a 15-inch MacBook Pro variant for video pros that can support the big, hot, and hungry workarounds needed to get 32 GB or more into a notebook, the way they made a 13-inch variant without a Touch Bar and with only two Thunderbolt 3 ports? Take a step back and think about this product: let’s say Apple releases a MacBook Pro, probably 15” with a special configuration for power users: you can build it out to 32Gb (probably comes in 16 and 32Gb only), has a beefier CPU/GPU — and gets 2-3 hours of battery life. So effectively, they’re reinventing the portable office machine, not a laptop. Stop and think about how the internet would react to this product. Now, start muting all the yelling, and ask yourself: If you had a choice between this product, or buying the existing MacBook Pro with good battery life but some struggles with 4K video processing (which seems to be the space where this memory is going to hurt a bit), I’d go with the smaller RAM on the existing laptop. I expect all but the most hard-core video nerds would, too. So, think about niches and market sizes: If only about 10% (SWAG(1) numbers) of MacBook Pro users are likely to have memory issues at 16Gb and then only for specific tasks like 4K video rendering, and if only 40% of those users would consider buying this memory enhanced special product (at a premium), is it worth Apple doing? I’m thinking not. At the same time, I’m not saying there’s no issue here: it bothers me that users have no viable options here at all right now, but Apple can’t solve a problem Intel’s left no solution for. I do think/hope that an updated kick-butt Mini after the first of the year could be one way through this for most of the users impacted by the memory, but we won’t know for a while, and the uncertainty is bad news for the user base. Missing the forest for the trees [Update: I grabbed the wrong CPU benchmark; my bad. Updated this to the corrected info — it’s not doubled, it’s roughly the same as my current Laptop, but since I’m going from the top end 15″ model to a 13″ model, that’s really what I was expecting in the first place — chuq] Among the noise being made about this upgrade by people complaining these new laptops bring nothing for them to the table are a bunch of basic enhancements being ignored: when I looked up raw benchmarks on my existing 2013 unit and the one I bought, I found the CPU benchmark doubled and the GPU benchmark was about the same. On top of that, a bigger, faster SSD and faster RAM mean this machine should be a lot faster and more capable. Also in the long run, USB C is a performance win, and so is Thunderbolt 3. For Photographers, the new wide color monitor looks to be a massive upgrade. This machine is a much better machine in many ways, which is being ignored in the discussions about all of the other features in the device. Lets Talk Bottom Line I think these computers are taking some valid criticism, but much of that criticism is ignoring a lot of the positives that these new computers have, including nice improvements in CPU and GPU speed and faster RAM, all indicating nice bumps in overall performance. But having said that, the fact that so much of the Mac product line is such a cluster and Apple didn’t acknowledge that makes the criticism understandable and deserved. What we got from Apple was good; what we needed from Apple was that and more — and it didn’t happen. This was all Apple being Apple, but this time, because of the issues in the product line, it wasn’t enough. I’m disappointed Apple said nothing about desktops this event, but not surprised. Personally, I was hoping to get a nice desktop and a MacBook, but since there’s no new desktop to buy, I’m picking up the MacBook pro and so I lose my chance to give Apple even more money during this round of upgrades. I’m really looking forward to getting my hands on this new laptop and seeing how it performs. I’m hopeful the new Touch Bar will be a tool and not a toy, but time will tell on that. And I’m really, really hoping that early in 2017 Apple unless the new iMac, the new MacPro line, and that all of this will finally be behind us; unfortunately, this product line cluster has run on about a year longer than I’m happy with — in many ways, we can blame Intel for the cause, but Apple takes it’s part of blame for poor communication on all of this. But if there’s one truth I can predict moving forward, no matter what Apple does, there will be people criticizing it. That’s just life in the Apple ecosystem. Notes: (1) SWAG: Silly Wild Ass Guess, although my percentages of users affected by the memory limitation is based around talks I’ve had this last few days trying to scope out the impact of this.

It's easy to assume that Silicon Valley has a corner on tech innovation. But China-based LeEco reminds us that it certainly does not. Chris Neiger (TMFNewsie) Oct 31, 2016 at 3:50PM Image source: LeEco. What if I told you Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) wasn't the first major smartphone company to ditch the 3.5 mm headphone jack? The Cupertino-based tech giant got a lot of flak while patting itself on the back for having the "courage" to ditch the old port, but the China-based electronics giant, LeEco, beat Apple to it over the summer (for better or worse) in not one, but three of its smartphones. And what if I told you that Matt Damon's next movie, The Great Wall, is being partially funded by that same Chinese tech player -- the same one that wants its new electric car to compete with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and has raised $1 billion to take on the company. LeEco (short for LeEcosystem) is not afraid to make bold claims against American tech companies, and its recent announcement that it's going to sell its full suite of hardware products in the U.S. means we're about to find out if it can really back up all the talk. Where LeEco wants to compete In short, LeEverywhere. The company made its name selling televisions, quite literally: It was officially known as LeTV until it recently changed its name. The company sells televisions under its own name in China, and over the summer expanded into the U.S. when it bought Vizio's TV division for $2 billion. As I mentioned before, it also makes smartphones. Its top of the line Le Pro 3 sports a 5.5-inch display and sells for just $400. It's cheaper Le S3 comes in at just $250, and both can tap into the company's own cloud service to boot.  One of LeEco's phones, the Le S3. Image source: LeEco. LeEco CEO Yueting Jia (who goes by YT Jia) hasn't shied away from sharing his thoughts on Apple's shortcomings. Earlier this year, he asserted that Apple was "outdated" and said, "In China, you can see that Apple has already begun to lose the rapid sales growth momentum." He went on to call Apple's innovation "extremely slow" and pointed to the iPhone SE as a failure to innovate.  OK, so Yueting's not too keen on Apple. But his company is also taking aim at Tesla. It unveiled the prototype for its electric car, LeSEE, back in April, and is investing over $1.8 billion to build a factory in China to manufacture them. That's in addition to the $1 billion it just raised in September to help develop the vehicle. LeEco says the plant will eventually reach an annual production of 400,000 vehicles, though it has not yet said when it expects the LeSEE will go into production. LeEco is convinced the American market is ready for its products. In a blog post, Jia said: In 2013, I visited the U.S. and was impressed with the influence of Hollywood as the birth place of culture and art, and the innovation that was happening in Silicon Valley. What was clear, though, was the lack of synergy between the entertainment and technology industries. Although the industrial specialization in the U.S. creates perfection in some areas, it has also put up rigid boundaries and divisions between industries, and has hindered innovation to a large extent. The company's electric car prototype, the LeSEE. Image source: LeEco. He's setting out to change that with his company -- and it'll be more than just dabbling in the U.S. market. LeEco has plans to hire 12,000 employees in Silicon Valley, up from just 500 right now. Its U.S. headquarters will be housed in a 48-acre complex it bought from Yahoo! for $250 million, and it plans to build its own 3 million square-foot facility soon as well Believe or not, this is a content play Despite all of its hardware devices, a car, and even an electric bike, LeEco is formidable content owner, and its underlying purpose in creating hardware and services is to bring that content to more screens.  In his U.S. launch blog post, Jia said that the company is focused on "... building a vertically integrated and open ecosystem that combines platform, content, devices and applications. Effectively, we are making it possible to seamlessly deliver content to any screen at any time." LeEco is focused on getting content into users' hands. Image source: LeEco. LeEco will use its video-subscription service and film production company to help with that, along with its library of 5,000 movies and 100,000 TV shows. The company doesn't own all of that content, but rather licenses it, just like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon do for much of their video content. And the company is making more deals all the time, with Lionsgate, MGM, Showtime and others topping its most recent content-partnership list.  "By integrating the best content with the best hardware through our EUI -- ecosystem user interface -- we are creating an 'Eco Lifestyle,' a truly connected experience and life," said Jia. It's still unclear whether or not that will model work in the U.S. or not. As research firm TrendForce wrote a few months ago: As most of its revenue comes from streaming video subscribers, LeEco intends to use the VIZIO brand to enter the North American market and replicate its business model there. However, LeEco will have more difficulty in getting subscribers in North America than in China due to competition from the region's major video streaming platforms such as Netflix. LeEco is small by many tech conglomerate standards. It brought in just $15 million in profit in the first quarter of this year. But with the company already expanding into Hong Kong, India and Russia, it's clear LeEco is bent on expanding its hardware and content synergies on a worldwide scale -- and now those synergies will be put to the ultimate test as the company tries to take on America's biggest tech giants.  Chris Neiger has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Apple’s decision to ditch almost all the legacy ports on its flagship notebook was done in the name of ushering in widespread adoption of Thunderbolt 3 and enabling a thinner machine. However, while Thunderbolt 3 may undoubtedly be a better connector than the bevy of sockets along the edge of the old MacBook Pro, the Cupertino firm’s decision to go slim has frustrated many who have legacy devices to plug in, and who were hoping for a more significant power upgrade. Listen to that cohort, and Apple has clearly lost its way. The MacBook Pro was once “a truck” they point out, a powerhouse that made performance – CPU, GPU, and memory, for the most part – its lodestar and left the aesthetic to shape itself around that. Now, in an age of 4K video processing and virtual reality rendering, the new MacBook Pro has been distracted with Touch Bar fripperies and forgotten its true purpose. Perhaps, though, the truck just needs an optional trailer. In the interests of transparency, I should say I’ve been asking for something along these lines since 2013. Back then, I was hoping for an upgrade to the original Thunderbolt Display, which even then was already a couple of years old. With the state of hardware at the time, I was envisaging a combination monitor, external drive, port hub, and graphics chip all hooked up over a Thunderbolt 2 cable – perfect for the Mac Pro which had just launched. Apple never bothered updating the Thunderbolt Display and, earlier this year, axed it from the line-up altogether. Indeed, the latest suggestions are that the company has exited the standalone monitor space altogether, preferring to leave the segment to third-party manufacturers like LG. In fact, an LG Thunderbolt 3 display got an on-stage mention at the event last week. It’s not such a bad idea. There’s no denying that LG Display, the company’s LCD arm, makes great panels: after all, Apple uses them on the iMac 5K. Monitor margins are traditionally low, though, so leaving third-party companies to fill the gap makes bottom-line sense for Apple too. Problem is, while the LG UltraFine 5K Display – with its $1,299.95 price tag – has three USB-C downstream ports on the back, you’re still going to need dongles if you want USB Type-A, ethernet, a memory card reader, or other “legacy” connections. That’s still not ideal. So, if Apple isn’t going to replace the Thunderbolt Display, what could it have in mind? Making predictions like that is always fraught, but one straightforward fix would be a docking station. I’m thinking something roughly the size of a Mac Mini, connecting to your MacBook Pro with a single Thunderbolt 3 cable, and acting as a supercharged desktop hub. That would have the benefit of not only taking advantage of Thunderbolt 3 but exemplifying what makes it special in the interconnect space. More ports, and a broader range of ports, would be table stakes of course. The current Mac Mini has gigabit ethernet, HDMI, two Thunderbolt 2, four USB 3, an SDXC card slot, and audio in/out. Apple would only need to switch Thunderbolt 2 for 3 to bring it up to speed, though a second display output – since you can drive two 4K panels from a single Thunderbolt 3 connection – would be nice as well. Onboard storage would, I suspect, be optional. Some people will be content with the high-speed SSD inside their shiny new MacBook Pro, or satisfied with a more mainstream external HDD for periodic backups. However, Apple’s markup on storage upgrades are notorious, and could be a neat little cash-cow for a Thunderbolt 3 dock. What could really set such a hub aside, though, is an external GPU. Much has been made of Apple’s decision to use Radeon Pro 400 Series chips in the new 15-inch MacBook Pro; after all, there’s already faster silicon in AMD’s lineup. The argument is that it’s a performance/power/size matter: try to squeeze in anything more potent and you can no longer make the ten hour battery life promise, or slim the chassis down to 15.5 mm thick. I’m not going to add to the argument about whether that’s a trade off decision the professional audience traditionally drawn to the MacBook Pro would have made, but I do think Apple could pitch an external GPU dock as an answer. By offloading graphics processing to meatier silicon in an external box with no real ambitions of portability, Apple wouldn’t have to think about power consumption, heat, or size. Indeed, it could eschew mobile GPUs altogether and drop in desktop-class graphics if it wanted. It’s questionable how many power-users need the most potent graphics processing while on the move. Many of those voicing concerns about the Radeon Pro 400 Series I’ve seen have pitched their MacBook Pro as more like an all-in-one desktop that can be transported, rather than a machine they take from coffee shop to coffee shop, hot-desking while rendering VR in 4K. Their argument is that they use their notebook plugged in and so power consumption isn’t an issue. Delivering the sort of graphics performance which will satisfy that crowd is a lot easier in an external form-factor. It also allows Apple to continue to pitch the 15-inch MacBook Pro as a mobile workhorse with lengthy battery life, in addition to offering 13-inch MacBook Pro owners a GPU option beyond the Intel Iris 540/550 graphics the smaller model tops out at. Clearly, there are some users who don’t want a full 15-inch notebook in their backpack, but who wouldn’t argue with an extra slice of GPU ability at times too. Best of all – from Apple’s perspective, at least – it would be another income stream. The Thunderbolt Display cost $999; a Thunderbolt 3 dock with an onboard GPU could, theoretically, cost significantly more depending on the graphics chip included. Certainly there’d be complaints from some, but when you’re faced with spending $200 to switch the Radeon Pro 450 2GB to its 460/4GB sibling in the 15-inch notebook, splashing out on a potentially far more potent GPU in a hub with port flexibility and perhaps onboard storage might be easier to swallow, especially if it can be shared between two or more computers. NOW READ: New MacBook Pro hands-on Would such a distribution of power be accepted by the pro users traditionally most vocal in their praise of Apple’s hardware? It’s hard to imagine how the company could satisfy its own goals of thinner devices, maintaining battery longevity, and pushing wholeheartedly for new connectors, while simultaneously giving professionals the notebook they want, all in a single form-factor. Not without some vast improvement in battery technology, at least. Arguably, splitting the hardware up makes a lot of sense, given the sort of work many MacBook Pro owners are doing. For those with a focus on 4K design – whether 2D or 3D – a large external display seems an inevitability. Why not split out the graphics processing too?

The worldwide tablet slump continues, dropping 14.7 percent year on year to 43 million shipments in the third quarter of 2016, though that's up 9.8 percent from the second quarter of this year. Apple, Samsung, Lenovo, and generic "white box" slates continue to lost ground to Amazon and Huawei, according to IDC. Amazon was an outlier with 3.1 million units shipped in Q3—a 319.9 percent growth over 2015. But that success was largely due to strong sales of the 7-inch Fire tablet, which was heavily discounted during July's Prime Day sale. "We're witnessing real tectonic movements in the market with slate companion devices sold as the low-end serving a broader platform strategy, like Amazon is doing with Alexa on its Fire tablets," Jean Philippe Bouchard, research director for IDC tablets, said in a statement. Huawei, meanwhile, topped last year's numbers by 28.4 percent with 2.4 million units shipped between July and September. Known for its smartphones, the Chinese manufacturer's tablets—many of which come integrated with cellular connectivity but Wi-Fi-only prices—are picking up steam. Still, Apple and Samsung continue to lead the pack. No. 1 Cupertino counted 9.3 million unit shipments—mostly iPad Air and iPad mini models—in Q3. The company's push for the iPad Pro, however, didn't pay off, and Apple fell 6.2 percent since 2015. Samsung, with 6.5 million units, took an even bigger hit, dropping 19.3 percent year over year. Other, non-brand slates, which account for 44.2 percent of the market (twice as much as Apple), also declined nearly 30 percent. Earlier this year, IDC suggested 2-in-1 devices are the one bright spot among tablets. Slate shipments were down 10.1 percent at the time, but if you consider 2-in-1s part of the market, the devices "reached an all-time high" of 8.1 million units. //Related Articles Sprint Offers Tablets With Unlimited Data for $20 Per Month Unfortunately, as senior research analyst Jitesh Ubrani pointed out, many of those low-cost (sub-$200) detachables come with an equally low-cost experience. "The race to the bottom is something we have already experienced with slates and it may prove detrimental to the market in the long run as detachables could easily be seen as disposable devices rather than potential PC replacements," Ubrani said. Market share among tablet operating systems, meanwhile, continue to shift away from iOS and Android toward Windows, Strategy Analytics reports. Microsoft's mobile OS shipments grew 25 percent year-on-year to 7.3 million units in Q3, capturing 16 percent market share. "Microsoft has led a transformation in the tablet market," Strategy Analytics Service Director Peter King said in a statement. "Apple is now reliant on iPad Pro for tablet and laptop replacement, while many other PC OEMs [original equipment manufacturers] abandon Android slates in favor of more expensive 2-in-1 Windows tablets for better productivity and versatility."

But technology inherently demands change — and that change is demanded at the fastest rate possible. We can complain about it all day long, but if we stop complaining at the whims of our feelings and start thinking logically, we can and should start to feel better as we realize the true nature of our so-called upgrade-cycle and innovation-searching frustrations. In reality, the only thing lacking innovation is our expectation. Media loves nothing more than punchy headlines. Headlines that claim Apple is on its way down and can’t innovate as Microsoft looks to beat it at its own game are nothing more than journalist-sanctioned click-bait gold, but make little sense for those actually interested in good journalism. Sure, the Microsoft Surface Studio is flashy with its new rotating input device, but how practical is it, really, compared to other options that are or will become available? Time will tell, but as pretty and fun and swanky as it looks, there are a number of aspects to the device that make this one seem more like a gimmick than anything else. I'm not yet sold. Sure, it could end up being amazing. But I'm not yet convinced that the Surface Studio's new Dial is that much better than other already-existing input devices. For those that want more dial-like controls, we've already had fully modular and customizable options such as Palette. A Short and General History Apple has a history not of being first to the market with various technologies, but of bringing features we need only when the technology to implement them is ready (though we, ourselves, are often not quite ready). The Mac was far from the first desktop personal computer. The iPhone was far from the first smartphone. The iPad was far from the first tablet. But Apple launched each of these products with features that made perfect sense in the time and technological environment in which they were born. The same thing happened with feature changes within these product lines. As data port technologies such as USB and Thunderbolt matured and improved, technology had to adopt these changes eventually. In some cases, Apple waited (such as with the advent of USB 3.0) for the peripheral market to catch up. In other cases (such as with the DVD drive and the iPhone’s headphone jack), Apple brazenly led the charge in ridding the world of a fading technology in favor of better, modern technologies. No matter how you look at it, Apple's newest laptops are sleek, powerful, envy-worthy computers. The trade-offs to make for them require nothing different from anything else we've been doing. We're just going to need a few different cables than the ones we currently have. These changes aren’t always easy to swallow, but Apple’s proven track record of doing what makes sense to give the world a little nudge forward should earn it a little slack. Many of Apple’s biggest fans chastised the company for dropping the DVD drive with the Retina MacBook Pro. And yet, looking back, Apple made this decision at the perfect time. Since Netflix and Amazon and iTunes have done such a great job of filling in the media market, no one actually needed a DVD drive anymore. Software was quickly becoming online-only (subscription-based software was yet another trend around the corner). And the DVD drive was obsolete. We just didn’t know it, yet. But Apple did. And we should trust Apple to know what it’s doing today. Lack of Innovation The entire “Can Apple innovate without Jobs?” question is a tired one. Unfortunately for the company, it’s hard to innovate when everyone is looking for ways to prove you’re not. But what is innovation? Some of us want to be wowed by another product category or a completely new type of electronic, as the iPhone was at the time of its introduction. The only problem with that is that, again, the iPhone wasn’t that new. It was just the best incarnation of a device we’d been using for quite some time. It might seem rough to trivialize something that revolutionized the smartphone industry and changed our lives in such a big way. But it’s true. It didn’t invent how we spoke. And the entire idea of the device was to be the last portable electronic device we needed. So why are we still searching for something new and different that we don’t need? The iPad is a great example of this. Everyone wants a new product, and Apple gives it to them in the form of the iPad. And yet, everyone complains that the iPad isn’t necessary. And if they like the iPad, they complain that the portable computer is no longer necessary. In reality, this should all be OK without the need for complaints. Not everyone needs one device or another. The iPhone is designed to be and should be the only one-device-fits-all product. As for the rest, make your decision, buy what you need, and enjoy the rest of your life without freaking out if or when something new comes out. The New MacBook Pros and System Performance Of course, technology still needs to move forward. And it’s fair to expect regular updates as technology improves. Apple did wait quite some time to introduce new laptops this time around, but the reality is that Intel took quite some time to release new processors that would make it worth the upgrade. They even announced an entire change in the rate at which they would progress with their manufacturing processes. How much thinner do people expect it to get? Still, if we pause to take a look at what Apple really accomplished in these new computers, it’s hard to see how they aren’t amazing. They’re thinner than and as light as a MacBook Air, but perform at levels good enough to edit 4K video, run multiple 5K screens, and transfer data at more than three gigabytes per second — more than six times the rate of most of today’s high-end solid state drives. Battery life remains unchanged, and we get up to four, lightning-fast, state-of-the-art Thunderbolt 3 ports that can handle anything you throw at them with greater expandability and flexibility than any other port — ever. And if you want to complain about processor speed or other specs, just remember numbers aren’t everything (this iPhone versus Galaxy test shows how great hardware-software integration can make lower-featured devices outperform those that feature over-killed specifications). Sure, there are some caveats. You need to get an adapter or two for most of your devices (for now). The SD card slot is missing. And there’s no dedicated HDMI out. But can we be real about the practicality of these features for just a moment? None of this is anything new. Ports have been improving and changing rapidly in the last 10 years. We already need, have, and use cables between all of our peripherals. What’s the difference between using a few different cables than the ones we have? Soon enough, our peripherals will ship with the same ports, too, and all of this will be a distant memory. The SD card isn’t necessarily going to be as ubiquitous as we think it is. The organization that manages the Compact Flash standard threw its support behind the XQD format with the newly announced CFexpress format to likely be backwards-compatible with XQD. For the professionals such as a lot of us that really need fast transfer rates, our cameras support a variety of different technologies (from CFAST to CF to SD and XQD), so many of us are using separate, dedicated readers anyway. And for a good chunk of the general public, most consumer cameras feature wireless image transfer, which will only become more and more common with time. The absence of the SD card slot is Apple's way of saying, "It just won't matter for that much longer, anyway." And HDMI out? Really? I could have gone without this port a lot sooner, especially considering the frequency with which I actually used it. Thunderbolt 3 and the way that it paves for the future is brighter than any of these. Now, everyone has the flexibility and expandability for anything they could ever want. Your I/O ports are no longer suited to only a handful of people who happen to need those exact ports just perfectly. Everyone has the ability to get one adapter that perfectly suits them. Apples and Oranges Getting back to Microsoft and its supposed overshadowing of Apple’s keynote event, Microsoft’s greatest innovation is simply the fact that it made another computer and is continuing to make them in general. As great of a job as their team did with the sturdiness of the design and the implementation the true-to-life display size (12-point font on the screen of the Microsoft Surface Studio is the same size as when printed on a sheet of paper), it’s just a big touchscreen desktop with a new input device from which only professional designers will really benefit. The Surface Studio is beautiful, but it's not any more of a game-changer than any other new-ish computer out there. Hewlett-Packard released the TouchSmart back in 2007. This is just better (as it should be, by now). Meanwhile, the comparison between the two rivals’ events is moot, since so many seem to forget the fact that Microsoft is releasing a professional desktop for designers while Apple is releasing portable notebooks fit for anyone that wants a step up to the on-the-go power-user. The two devices are in completely different categories. Naturally, desktop fans are still waiting for Apple to revamp the iMac — and rightly so. The iMac, too, hasn’t seen a meaningful update in far too long. And I won’t get you all started on the lack of refreshes for the Mac Pro. But with new processor releases from Intel around the corner, I wouldn’t be surprised if there’s more to follow soon. Not at all to take away from Microsoft, but to sit around and say Apple is slacking and Microsoft is blowing away the competition is absurd. Look at the performance really being offered and the subsequently improved portability. It’s impressive — period. In a few months, the media will likely sing the same song — at least until Apple can please its investors with record profits once again, as is largely expected next quarter. Yet the general public will be more or less silently loving their new MacBook Pros because they really are the best computers around. Meanwhile, for PC lovers, Microsoft is doing a great job of producing some competition-worthy computers for its professional users. Why is everyone in such a hurry to get in another fight over all of this? Posted In:  Fstoppers Originals Gear Opinion Follow Adam works mostly across California on all things photography and art.

The New Microsoft Surface Studio Looks Amazing Astrophotographers Rejoice: Apple's iOS 10 Includes Color Filters to Make Your Screen Completely Red Log in or register to post comments 108 Comments Mike Leland - October 31, 2016 I love the 4 USB ports. I also am in my 40s and remember the transition from parallel ports and serial ports to ps2 ports to USB-A ports. I remember when people were up in arms about manufacturers dropping serial ports from their machines in favor of universal serial (USB) USB-C is way more universal and way more awesomer. 16gb RAM is retarded, though. I would really like to see this addressed. 3 -1 0 -8 Since you didn't say which system only has 16gb RAM (its RAMM btw) I'll make a wild guess you meant the Surface Studio. The top of the libe 17 version comes with 32Gb od RAMM.. But Apple being Apple and dropping the industry standard hmdi/vga/usb video outputs, has now pissed of EVERY business person who has to do presentations and meetings with no way to plug into or access any company's media projector or display. Apple falls on its face in the real world of business. kris risner - October 31, 2016 Lane Shurtleff He meant the Macbook... 5 0 g coll - October 31, 2016 Lane Shurtleff "RAM (its RAMM btw)" What are you taking about? 2 0 Lane Shurtleff - October 31, 2016 g coll My mistake. I confused it with SO-DIMM. RAM or SDRAM is correct. 3 0 Mike Leland - October 31, 2016 Lane Shurtleff So, yeah. Since I was busy all day doing photo shoots (this is a site for photographers, right?) I am just now getting back to a little free time. Yes, I was referring to the macbook pro referenced in the post I had replied to and prefaced with "4 USB ports". How was that not obvious? (Also, thank you, kris risner) Not, it is not "RAMM", its RAM. Seriously? Does it stand for Random Access Memory or Random Access Memory Motherfucker? Is "Lane Shurleff" actually Jules Winnfield? (thanks, g coll) I am a business person as I run an incredibly successful photography business (this it a site for photographers, right?) and I have NO PROBLEM with buying a laptop that has THE NEW STANDARD USB PORTS so that when I go to plug in to a boardroom system in 6 months that only has USB-C inputs, I won't have to make excuses for living in the past. Lane, I know that you admitted to your mistake 3 hours ago but I feel like I should give you a hard time since you were so quick to (incorrectly) give me a hard time over a clearly pedantic element of my comment. I felt it necessary to bring this up as your reply clearly illustrates the fact that I poorly communicated my position to you. So I'll lay it out to you in plain english: I'm mad that the new macbook pro only has 16gb of ram. Or rammmmm.... whatever. I need to get ready for tomorrow's shoots. You can get ready for your board meeting or whatever it is that you do. 4 -4 Leigh Smith - November 1, 2016 Mike Leland Pat yourself on the back a few more times about your photoshoots, and being a photographer. 8 -2 Cesar Sales - November 1, 2016 Leigh Smith ikr 2 -2 Mike Leland - November 1, 2016 Leigh Smith Will do, cupcake... 2 -1 Paolo Defilipis - November 1, 2016 Leigh Smith You're sad that this guy makes high profile photo shoots and you don't? Jealousy? Let's all just be friend instead, ok? 0 -1 Mike Leland - November 1, 2016 Paolo Defilipis Ehhh I wouldn't go there, buddy. I think he just misunderstood why I prefaced my statement with the fact that I'm a photographer. It was because the person I was replying to was talking about non photography related uses of the laptop and I was trying to make a point that the context of my original post mattered only to photography related uses and that this is a photography site, not a "business" site. But thank you, anyway. Yes, I would love for everyone here to be friends! 1 -1 Leigh Smith - November 2, 2016 Mike Leland But doing presentations is very photography related. I was at a gallery talk the other day where the photographer was trying to find the right adaptor for the projector. 1 -1 Artistic iQ - November 1, 2016 Mike Leland I love it MIKE!! 😂👍💯... Random Access Memory Motherfckr!!!!! 2 0 Mike Leland - November 1, 2016 Artistic iQ Thanks man. I'm glad that someone caught the humor in my post. Apparently it wasn't all that popular. Too many armchair quarterbacks in here, I guess... 1 -2 B In SEA - November 1, 2016 Mike Leland "16gb RAM is retarded, though. I would really like to see this addressed." It was a battery life decision. The Intel processors they chose to use only work with the 3rd gen low power ram, which only can go up to 16gb ram. I would prefer higher power components and using a thicker body to make up the battery life, but that's the decision they made. Next update to this body will get new processors and ram that can go to 32gb, I guess they're sacrificing some in this first iteration so that the 2nd and 3rd iteration of this form factor will be pretty ideally balanced. 4 0 Mike Leland - November 1, 2016 B In SEA That makes perfect sense. It stinks but it is what it is, I guess. I would also take a slightly thicker body for a more powerful machine. Heck, my last MBP was a 17" behemoth. 1 0 Isidro Lopez - November 3, 2016 B In SEA Yes, it was a battery life issue. Apple is using only power efficient components in these machines now. They have sold the idea of "all day battery life" even though we all know that would mean using one program with the backlight off. You're much better off with an iMac at this point. 0 0 Matt Nikkel - November 1, 2016 [Edited] Mike Leland I think the distinction is that USB was a lot more mature when Apple started completely ditching all those other ports than USB-C is now. The ports had been showing up on machines for a few years alongside the legacy ports, and a lot of people already had at least some USB devices when Apple made that switch. While I agree that USB-C is the future, it's still completely in it's infancy. It's also not really a viable replacement for either the MagSafe adapter or an SD slot. There's no reason this needs to be exclusively USB-C. Two USB-C, a USB 3.0, an SD slot, and a magsafe power cord would have made just as clean looking machine and would have been infinitely more functional for 99% of their potential customers. 4 0 Mike Leland - November 1, 2016 Matt Nikkel Magsafe would be nice. USB 3.0 is easy peasy. There are $2 adapters that are less than an inch long that cleanly convert any USB-A male to a USB-C male. SD card slot would be good for a lot of people. I don't have any use for them since I don't use cameras that have SD slots. I may be in the minority, there. I understand why they removed them, though, since we are also in a transition with card technology. 1 0 Brian Corrigan - November 2, 2016 Mike Leland Well, Mike, I have to agree with your assessment(s), but I hate having to agree with a guy in his 40's who feels compelled to use the word "retarded." Really? 0 -1 Mike Leland - November 2, 2016 Brian Corrigan Why does the word "retarded" bother you? It is a technically accurate description of the computer being available with only 16GB RAM when other computers have 32GB and 64GB options. It means that the advancement of the computer has been delayed held back. 0 0 Brian Corrigan - November 3, 2016 Mike Leland Are you serious?! It's one thing to be offensive with the use of the word, it's another to be intellectually dishonest about your use of the word. You said, "16gb RAM is retarded, though. I would really like to see this addressed." I think we all know what you meant. You should quit while you're behind. We'll take your feeble, backtracking explanation as an admission of guilt, and we forgive you. We would ask that you refrain from using offensive language. This forum and the world will be better for it. 0 -2 Mike Leland - November 3, 2016 Brian Corrigan Ahahaha! Whatever. I can say what I want. 16gb of RAM is retarded. If that offends you, go find a safe space and stay off the internet. 1 0 Brian Corrigan - November 4, 2016 Mike Leland Yes, you can say what you want. And you did. And I pity you. 0 0 Isidro Lopez - November 3, 2016 Brian Corrigan You sound like an easily offended millenial with mommy issues. Or maybe you have multiple personality disorder since you refer to yourself as "we". You don't speak for all of us in this forum mr brian corrigan. 0 0 Brian Corrigan - November 4, 2016 Isidro Lopez Mr. Isidro Lopez. I happen to be a father of a 22-year-old son with intellectual disabilities who is struggling to make it in this world. And while I'm not easily offended, I am offended when one chooses to use the word "retarded" when they really mean something like stupid, ignorant, short-sided, foolish, etc. You and Mr. Leland clearly view individuals with intellectual disabilities as stupid, ignorant, short-sided and foolish. My son, and those like him, are none of those things. You two, however, are all of those things. We, yes WE, pity both of you. There is really nothing more to be said. Quit while you're behind (although I suspect you won't be able to help yourself). Carry on. It's not wise to get into a battle of wits with fools. I'm going to go take some pictures. Let's just all do that, shall we? 1 -1 Isidro Lopez - November 4, 2016 Brian Corrigan Wow, so having a loved one with intellectual disabilities gives you the right to bully people on the internet? You think it's ok to tell me that I view individuals with intellectual disabilities as stupid? My sister is DS but that doesn't mean I go around and take it out on other people. I don't search websites for keywords so that I can make people feel sorry for me. You have serious issues, asshole. 0 0 Brian Corrigan - November 5, 2016 Isidro Lopez Given the choice to do nothing, do the right thing, or double down on ignorance, you chose to double down on ignorance. Why am I not surprised. I really feel sorry for your sister who has to put up with such ignorance from her own brother. It's too bad you chose to defend a guy who uses the word "retarded" in a manner that he admits was intended as an insult. If you can't see that, then you have an issue with reading comprehension. And quit trying to play the "bully" victim....it is unbecoming. Sheesh. There is really nothing more to be said. You and your buddy have really said it all. Now let's go take some pictures. 0 0 Isidro Lopez - November 5, 2016 Brian Corrigan Here's a baking forum for you to go bully people in. Have fun telling all of these bread bakers what awful mean, fools they are for using proper terminology that hurts your feelings. http://www.thefreshloaf.com/node/30767/shaping-cold-retarded-dough 0 0 8 0 Just a correction, the AiO is Surface Studio which the Apple equivalent is the iMac or more akin to HP's Z1 series, and the direct competitor to the Macbook Pro is the Surface Book. The Surface Pro is the 2-in-1 Tablet which is what the iPad Pro mimics. Also you along with many other people have missed the message about the Surface line. Surface isn't to compete with Apple or more importantly against MS's partners and OEMs instead it's about creating new categories and challenging people's perceptions about computers can do. Look at what the Surface Pro did, tablets wasn't new but what was missing was interactivity. Now 3 years later 2-in-1s are the only PC market not cratering by lack of sales, even tablets have flat lined or crashed. The Surface Studio was created based on feedback from professionals, as was the new Surfacebook. Something Apple has never done, you get what Apple thinks what you need. You mentioned the Surface Dial, yet neglect to mention the Touchstrip on the Macbook Pro which is more convenient? Which will be more practical? Time will tell, but the Dial has several historical precedents and is a proven technology (Nulooq, 3D Connexion etc) and Wacom uses a radial dial. Using a Dial will require you learn some new tricks to improve your workflow, and it will be compatible with all Windows devices but the onscreen support will be limited to Surface Pro 4, Surface Book and Surface Studio. As with any new peripheral such as the Wacom tablet you get what you put in. For reference I use a 3D Connexion Space Pilot to help me use Photoshop instead of hunting for keys when retouching skin between that and the Intuous it covers about 75% of the tools I need without having to go the keyboard. As to ports being removed, most Apple users tend to ignore the inconveniences of having dozens of cables, essential peripherals (negating the reduced weight ) and so on just to use macOS. Whereas Windows computers get vilified for every little fault in the media. Plus Thunderbolt suffers the same fault of Firewire, it's just too expensive considering how ubiquitous USB is, and there's barely any USB-C devices out there at present, and you're looking at least 2-3 years before they get to be as common. The problem with Apple and why there is so many negative headlines is that they've been hostile to professional users and not listening to them, they've been laser focused on iOS and neglecting macOS. iOS is flat lining. I'm not saying Apple is doomed far from it, they have some of the largest reserves in the industry but unless they start listening to the market that kept them going then people will leave especially if you get companies starting to copy the likes of Surface Studio. However between Apple and MS you'd expect Apple to come up with the next big thing, historically they have. Instead what do you have at present? MS is basically forcing everyone to stand up and watch, it started with the Surface Pro, then they announced one of the biggest surprises in the industry: Hololens, then it was Surfacebook and now Surface Studio. MS isn't designing for today, they are designing for the future. Final point, MS has the biggest R&D budget far exceeding that of Apple that's why they've been able to produce the Surface line and Hololens of which some of the technology has been in development for over 6 years. Here's a short overview of an actual user of Surface Studio, not a photographer but an illustrator. https://www.penny-arcade.com/news/post/2016/10/26/the-surface-studio Oh and good luck getting a Surface Studio if you want one, you won't get one this side of Xmas as they've sold out and they are low production systems unlike iMacs which are mass produced. That really underscores the difference between the ideologies. Edit: Amended device name.

(David Paul Morris/Bloomberg) Last week, Apple and Microsoft had dueling product-launch events. And in the tech version of this “Who wore it better?” contest, the winner seems to be: Microsoft. That’s right. At least in the microcosm of last week, Microsoft has made Apple look like the square, after lifting the veil on a 28-inch touch screen all-in-one desktop called the Surface Studio that immediately had tech enthusiasts drooling. Over a desktop. One could argue that this is an apples-to-oranges comparison. Microsoft, while on the rise again, still benefits from lower expectations than Apple. Introducing a new product, such as the Studio, is almost always going to be more exciting than upgrading an old line. But there is a common thread here, which we can use to analyze how these companies are thinking about the future — even more specifically, the future of touch and computing. Touch itself, as a technology, isn't new. But Microsoft did a good job of framing its incorporation of touch with the Studio as expansive, liberating, and a universal way to unlock potential. Who doesn’t want to think that they have a symphony, novel, or artistic masterpiece inside them, just waiting to be unlocked by the right new tools? Panos Panay, corporate vice president for Surface Computing, holds the new Microsoft Surface Studio computer at a live event in New York on Oct. 26. (Lucas Jackson/Reuters) Apple, on the other, seems to have uncharacteristically flubbed its audience pitch. Speaking to analysts after its event, it seemed that “current MacBook Pro owners looking to upgrade” was the main audience Apple was going for. That’s practical — Apple laptops sell well. It’s not inspiring, though, is it? What makes this even more odd is that Apple is the company that, arguably, did something really new for its company, at least — the Touch Bar shows off something we haven't seen from Apple before. The Surface Studio looks gorgeous, but Microsoft’s essentially made an enormous version of its Surface tablet. It’s a very stylish and powerful one, but that's basically what it is. Given a couple of days, and a truly dazzling Apple event, that probably could have become the story line for the Studio. But try to explain what exactly Apple did, and it’s surprisingly hard. They put a miniature iPhone screen at the top of the keyboard, that you could probably ignore if you wanted? That’s a too-harsh assessment of the Touch Bar from someone who’s only played around with it for less than a half-hour altogether. But the Touch Bar certainly lacks a clarity of purpose that Microsoft managed to nail with its products — and managed to nail by not-so-subtly going after Apple’s traditional market of creatives. Even Apple’s main onstage demos, of photo-editing and a DJ, weren’t effective pitches for the MacBook Pro. The demos were fine, but there needed to be something communicated to a broader set of users that wasn’t just, “Hey, you can stop using those keyboard shortcuts you’ve committed to muscle memory over the years.” Should it be all red lights and klaxons in Cupertino? Not necessarily. But there is a sense of longing for something more from Apple. Apple has a lot to prove, and it’s not proving it quite well enough. I’ve heard more “Well, I am a little tempted by the [insert competing product here]” from Apple fans this year than I’ve heard in a long time. Temptation isn’t enough to uproot a customer, particularly when you’ve done as good a job of keeping users in your ecosystem as Apple has. Apple will still make money, since Apple fans have proved in the past that they’re willing to pay a premium for its products, said Linn Huang, of the analysis firm IDC. “Apple is in the position to say, with something new, that it can charge what it wants,” he said. But that’s no way to retain happy customers, particularly for a firm that prides itself in manufacturing delight. Yet it’s somehow Microsoft — out of desperation, inspiration or a combination of both — that has managed to make products that are turning heads. Apple should not panic. But it should at least take note. business technology the-switch true Please provide a valid email address. Sign up You’re all set!

(AAPL) Stock Doesn’t Get Enough Respect Positive charts? Check. Compelling valuation? Check. So why does Apple stock get as little love as it does? Oct 31, 2016, 3:27 pm EST  |  By Dan Burrows, InvestorPlace Feature Writer     View All   Shares in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) have been in a downtrend since the company’s earnings last week. But a quick look at both valuation and technical indicators strongly suggests Apple stock will bounce back soon and silence the bears. Source: Beni Krausz via Unsplash Take a look at the chart below. AAPL stock tested its support at its 50-day moving average twice last summer — once in late July and once in early September. In both cases, shares bounced off the key level like it was a trampoline. If the third time is a charm, Apple stock has about another 1.3% decline in it before it tests the 50-day moving average again. A successful test isn’t guaranteed, of course. However, although Apple stock isn’t oversold, it is headed that way. And it’s trading at a similar relative strength index as it did during the last two successful tests. In short, the signs are promising. But where to then? The surprising popularity of the iPhone 7 is certainly a shot in the arm. And with shares up about 25% over the last three months, Apple stock could get a little extra boost thanks to window dressing. Plenty of fund managers looking to spruce up portfolios before year-end are happy to piggyback on any stock with strong momentum. However, as AAPL shares trade from here to the end of fiscal 2016, the key remains iPhone in the shorter-term and valuation in the long run. Both of those issues are probably more favorable than the market thinks. Apple’s iPhone Resilience One of the more pleasant surprises from Apple’s most recent earnings report was demand for the iPhone 7. AAPL actually was caught off guard by higher-expected-demand for iPhone 7, which was supposed to be just a place-holder before it wowed everyone with iPhone 8 next year. Instead, it’s proving to be an important stepping stone to Apple’s next big thing. From Credit Suisse analysts: “Fundamentally we believe our thesis remains intact with the iPhone 7 driving the business back to growth followed by an iPhone 8 super cycle. LT, given high retention rates, a superior ecosystem, and a multi-product compute advantage, we believe FCF of ~$67bn should be sustainable…Our installed base analysis suggests strong growth in 2018 driven by an iPhone 8 super cycle, SE strength, and an aging installed base …” These analysts have Apple stock at “Outperform” — essentially, a buy call.

Giant shield begins sliding over Chernobyl reactor FBI report: Hate crimes against Muslims rose by 67 percent last year Carr serves us all by stepping back and taking stock of what computers are – and aren’t. By Erik Spanberg October 31, 2016 Save for later Saved Scott Keneally About video ads View Caption of In 2011, Nicholas Carr summed up Facebook’s business model like this: “The desire for privacy is strong; vanity is stronger.” Carr spent the past dozen or so years making similar proclamations of high-tech heresy, questioning and often criticizing Silicon Valley billionaires and their armies of engineers and programmers for casting rapacious greed and manic, time-sucking online distractions as beneficial beacons of inevitable progress. Carr's new book, Utopia is Creepy ($26.95, W.W. Norton, 360 pages), is somewhat of a greatest-hits album. And, yes, album would be the proper term, since one of Carr’s peeves is the insistence by some that the streaming, track-by-track music delivery of today improves upon the full-album experience of yesteryear. Carr’s album includes the hits (“Is Google Making Us Stupid?”), a bonus track (“The Daedalus Mission”), and chapters and posts from his previous bestsellers and his Rough Type blog. Recommended: Famous last words: Take our literature quiz! What makes Carr effective is that he’s an ambivalent contrarian. He doesn’t live off the grid (is such a thing even possible?), he acknowledges his own irrational behavior at the mercy of smartphones and hyperlinks, and he wrestles with the blithe signing away of much of our privacy and existence during the so-called Web 2.0 era of social media. Test your knowledge Famous last words: Take our literature quiz! Photos of the Day Photos of the Day 11/14 Many times, Carr serves us all by stepping back and taking stock of what computers are – and aren’t. They’re tools for doing tasks, he writes, but they are not, and cannot ever be, infallible forces for bettering our world. And, in some cases, perhaps many, the latest may not be the greatest. “What makes one tool superior to another has nothing to do with how new it is,” Carr writes. Social media, in similar fashion, may have many attributes and uses, but it is not something that increases or leads to democracy or better government. And, almost invariably, whatever it is Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Twitter and other tech giants are offering to ease and connect their users’ lives, the goal isn’t a better world but a more profitable one and more time spent checking texts and posts and links and emails. There’s a reason Apple has its world headquarters at 1 Infinite Loop. These sound like simple observations, and they are, but few of us bother to consider such notions while pulling our phones from our pockets over and over for another injection of what turns out to be mostly ephemeral updates and disposable information. Carr is here to remind us — and to take a longer-term view of how we got here. As he writes in his introduction, “The greatest of America’s homegrown religions – greater than Jehovah’s Witnesses, greater than the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, greater even than Scientology – is the religion of technology.” In the 1800s, philosophers and cultural critics crowed over technological advances and how society would be improved and perfected through constant innovation. Again and again, changes in media, from the arrival of the record and radio to the advent of TV and the Internet, were met with pronouncements that universities and schools would be utterly transformed, rendering the traditional model of teachers and students gathered in a classroom as all but obsolete. Yet Harvard and Yale and Stanford and Cal, not to mention Florida State, Montana State, and Georgia Tech, among many others, still seem to have campuses intact. Remember a few years ago when the Kindle spelled the end of physical books? E-book sales have leveled off and most people still favor hardbacks and paperbacks. Carr isn’t trying to argue that we’re dropping digital and going all-analog, and if he tried, it would be ridiculous. What he is doing is lending perspective on what our insatiable infatuation with iPhones and Androids and Galaxies is doing to us and asking whether we might want to put some moderation in our digital diets. Carr spoke with me this week about “Utopia is Creepy” and the constant craving to hit the refresh button. Excerpts from our conversation are below. Q. You write that “smartphones have made media machines of us all,” but we are without empowerment and reflectiveness.” What do you think it might take to change us, if it’s possible to change us? The first thing that would be required to change the state of affairs is people beginning to not only question the influence of smartphones and related technologies over us, but actually changing their behavior. And as we all now know, that’s very difficult. Because even if you have some worries about the way your smartphone determined your behavior and your attention and the way your mind works over the course of the day, the services that we crave through a smartphone are designed to play into a very deep instinct that we have to want to know anything new that’s going on in the environment around us. Through notifications and alerts and this kind of perpetual worry that there might be some new message that we haven’t seen yet, that keeps us enslaved to the phone. We’ve kind of accepted that and, in order to change, we’d have to change our own behavior, which I think would ultimately change the way these services are designed. But until we really do change our behavior, I don’t think any other force will change the situation. Q. Have you seen these gag products that do nothing ( The Wall Street Journal wrote about empty plastic NoPhones last month) and some people going to flip phones? There are small pockets of rebellion out there.… There are definitely attempts by both users and designers of the technology to go down a different path. We see that with some people exchanging their smartphones for so-called dumb phones and we see it with certain software designers who are trying to create less-distracting interfaces, more uni-tasking services than multi-tasking services. And I think that’s great. It also shows us there is a broader anxiety among the public about the way we use our technology and how it might not be in our best interest, this obsessive-compulsive attachment to our phones, but both the concerns and the actions are still at the periphery of the culture. Q. I’m wondering whether you ever feel personally the way I feel when I’m checking my phone, which is, what am I looking for? Absolutely, because a lot of my writing comes out of my own experience. And I see through my own behavior this kind of strange, compulsive desire to discover what is predictably trivial. And even less than trivial. I think science shows us this is truly an instinct, there is this compulsion we have to not let any little change, new piece of information float by without it grabbing our attention for a second. And I do think companies like Facebook and other social media companies know very deeply how this works and design their services to play into that instinct. Q. You make the observation in one of your essays that we view computers as infallible and neglect to recognize that they are human-built and prone to hacking, bugs and other malfunctions. Why do you think we have so constantly elevated technology to god-like status? It’s a theme that has been running through American culture for a couple of hundred years now, this desire to define progress as technological rather than to see technology as one tool to promote social and cultural progress. I think it is tied up in the American psyche, this sense that there are shortcuts to progress. And that if we simply put our faith in technology, then we don’t really have to deal with the challenges and difficulties and complexities that are truly involved in pursuing progress. It also ties into our love of novelty. In one sense, that’s healthy because it does inspire inventors and entrepreneurs to push things forward, but it becomes counterproductive when it blinds us to the negative consequences of the technology. Too often, we allow our enthusiasm to overwhelm any kind of skepticism and that’s when we start to adopt technologies that aren’t in our best interest. Q. (In 2012) you made a comparison of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs to what you called a hierarchy of innovations, making the point that recent innovations haven’t been as transformative. How did people respond to that? It did get a lot of reaction, both in its original form, as a blog post, and then also The Wall Street Journal asked me to condense the piece into a short op-ed. It did seem to strike a chord and one of the reasons, I think, is because there has been a lot of discussion, a lot of debate about whether innovation has become trivialized through Silicon Valley. And there are two very different beliefs on that count. One is that we’ve never been more innovative and this is the golden age of technology and progress. And then there’s the other side held by many people, including some inside Silicon Valley, that we’re in what one person calls an innovation desert. Where we’re not seeing the huge, society-changing technological advances we saw a hundred years ago – where we had electrification and the arrival of the automobile and air conditioning, things that changed the way people lived – and I have sympathy for both of those views. Because there seems to be more investment and more interest in innovation than ever before and yet a lot of the innovation seems trivial — features on apps for social media. That led me to this different kind of conclusion that what’s really changed are people’s needs, which are much more self-absorbed and so our innovators cater to our needs. Entrepreneurs and innovators are going to respond to needs. Q. Given that, would Edison be working on emojis, were he around today? I think he may well have [laughs]. Because Edison was very much in tune with looking very carefully at society and figuring out, what are the gaps here that I can fill. I wrote a book about Edison’s role developing the electrical grid or utility and he was on some trip out West and he saw a bunch of people working with jackhammers and he had this idea that rather than power each machine individually, maybe you could create a network for electricity to be delivered wherever it’s needed. Lots of inventors try to figure out what are people yearning for and, today, if you want to get famous and rich as an inventor, the best way is to create some little app that Facebook will buy. Q. You mention in the book that you like gizmos, you aren’t a Luddite, but when you spend so much time writing about the deleterious effects of computers and smartphones, how does that affect your ability to enjoy those things? It probably hampers it because I have grown quite skeptical about technology. If there’s one way I’ve tried to change my personal behavior, it’s that I used to be very much an enthusiast about new technologies and the latest software. Now I try to approach these things with a skeptical viewpoint and say, how is this ultimately going to change my life and is it going to be a change for the better or a change for the worse? But I think ultimately it’s a healthier way to approach technology because it makes the technology subservient to something bigger rather than being the end-all of your existence. Q. Are you on Twitter, are you on Facebook, are you on Snapchat — what do you use in social media? It became clear to me that the social networking and social media services, for all the benefits that they have, and I don’t deny their charms, but they are very much designed to keep us perpetually distracted, perpetually looking at our screen, they intrude into our intellectual and social existence. If you look at the statistics, every few minutes during our waking hours, for a lot of people (they are checking for updates). The very first thing they look at when they wake up is their smartphone and the last thing they look at when they go to bed. I’m not on Facebook, I have a Twitter account, but I just use it to promote my blog posts, I’m on Instagram, but just with a few people, I don’t do Snapchat. So I’ve tried to avoid (a lot of participation) because I know I’m susceptible to this kind of compulsive behavior. And you do lose something. If all your friends and family are on Facebook, then you’re out of the loop. Q. How has social media affected the current campaign, especially given Donald Trump’s incessant tweets? It’s had a big effect. There’s a piece called “The Snapchat Candidate” [in the book] that I wrote for Politico last year during the primaries and I argue that media does affect political discourse. Over the last 100 years, there’s been three big changes: first was radio in the 1920s, next was television in the 1960s, and right now we’re seeing the way Twitter and Facebook and other social media does alter the way campaigns are conducted and what we expect from candidates. You saw it with the rise of Trump, which was fueled by Twitter and by social media and it very much suited his essential identity as this kind of provocation machines that could pump out these little tweets and get lots of attention. The whole political discourse began to be influenced by these provocative tweets. … The idea of being a substantial person has faded away a bit. Q. Of the major modern tech barons – Jobs and Gates and Bezos and Zuckerberg and so on – which, if any of them, do you admire the most and why? That’s a good question. I admire many qualities of Jobs because he looked at computer technology as a tool that people could use in ways that could expand their minds and their opportunities, which I think is the best way to view tools. Whereas a lot of the more recent big names in Silicon Valley – Zuckerberg, Larry Page (of Google), Bezos and so forth – I don’t think have that view. I think they see technology as a way to replace a lot of human thought and human activity and to make things easier and more convenient, not to challenge us to bigger things. The attitude of Silicon Valley, I’m speaking broadly not as a place but a state of mind, I think it’s changed and I think the change has evolved with the change in personal computing, which has gone from being a set of tools to being a kind of media environment that encloses us rather than opening up new horizons. And I think that’s unfortunate. Next up Test your knowledge Famous last words: Take our literature quiz!

Folks enrolled in Apple’s developer program can install the update via the over-the-air mechanism in the Settings app, or from the dev center. The move comes one week after 10.1 was released to the public, and just hours after Apple rolled out iOS 10.1.1 with bug fixes for Health data. It appears 10.2 will also bring about bug fixes and improvements. We are installing the new beta now, and will update this post if we come across any significant changes. And as always if you see something notable we haven’t mentioned, let us know in the comments below! Update: Here is a list of the new user-facing stuff found in iOS 10.2 thus far: New (Unicode 9) emoji – more than 100 new emoji including clown face, selfie, owl, shark, butterfly, pancakes and more. New camera setting – new Preserve Settings option in the Settings app under Photos & Camera that will let you preserve your last Camera Mode/Filter or Live Photo setting. New wallpapers – there are a few new wallpapers here that you’ve probably seen in iPhone 7 marketing materials. New Messages effect – new “Celebrate” screen effect option when using iMessage. Emergency contact alerts – a new setting in the Health app that has your iPhone automatically notify your emergency contacts when Emergency SOS is used. New Video widget – this new widget for the Videos app displays your movies and TV shows for quick access.

Designed for the fourth-generation Apple TV, the tvOS 10.1 beta can be obtained by connecting the Apple TV to a computer with a USB-C to USB-A cable, downloading and installing the software from a registered developer account via iTunes or Apple Configurator. Once a beta profile has been installed on the device through iTunes, new beta updates will be available over the air. It is not yet clear what new features or changes might be included in the tvOS 10.1 update, but many Apple TV owners are eagerly awaiting a new single sign-on feature that will allow Apple TV users to sign in once with their cable credentials to access live cable content included in a cable subscription. Single sign-on was not introduced in the initial tvOS 10 release, and Apple has said it will come in a future update. We are also expecting to see the new "TV" app soon. tvOS 10, for those unfamiliar with the operating system, brings features like improved search, expanded Siri capabilities, a dark mode, a Continuity option for using the iPhone for text input, automatic app downloads, quicker access to live TV, and more.

Tim Cook's Apple indeed Heh. SSO wasn't ready for the Apple TV launch, Portrait Mode wasn't ready for the iPhone 7 Plus launch, and AirPods (which should have been ready for the iPhone 7 launch since you're removing the jack) are still delayed. They're having a problem with deadlines for sure. Rating: 3 Votes critter13 2 weeks ago Wow, why does Apple even bother mentioning features like single sign on if they can't deliver after this long?

Everything in the house works perfect. The ATV is 10 feet from the router and never had a problem before the update. I have an awesome ubiquiti network with everything working at top speed except for the ATV since the upgrade. I never drop the network on any other device. It only happens when I use the Siri on the remote. Never while streaming anything. I did a clean install also and no help. I think I will do a hard line connection and see if that fixes it. There are all kinds of network issues that can manifest in weird ways. As an IT Professional I've heard my fair share of statements like yours, about 'how great' your network is. Everyone thinks it can't possibly be their network. It almost always is. But do check to see if your Siri remote firmware is up to date. Try testing Siri from your iPhone with the AppleTV app. If the request still fails, its network related.

To install the update, the Apple Watch must have 50 percent battery, it must be placed on the charger, and it must be in range of the iPhone. watchOS 3.1 requires an iPhone running iOS 10 to install. It is not yet known what new features might be included in the watchOS 3.1.1 update, but we'll update this post with any new discoveries. watchOS updates are often minor in scale, focusing on under-the-hood bug fixes and performance improvements. watchOS 3 completely overhauls the interface on the Apple Watch, introducing a dedicated app dock, instant launch apps, new watch faces, and new complication options. There are new Activity sharing features, a "Breathe" app guides users through deep breathing sessions to cut down on stress, and an SOS feature can automatically call emergency service.

Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) Oct 31, 2016 at 2:44PM As it becomes clearer that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is unlikely to ever turn Project Titan into an autonomous Apple-branded car of its own making, Motley Fool analyst Sean O'Reilly and senior auto specialist John Rosevear talk about a different auto company that's doing very well for itself: General Motors (NYSE:GM). Listen in to this clip from Industry Focus: Industrials to find out why long-term investors should look into this company. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Oct. 20, 2016. Sean O'Reilly: Before we head out, I always like to have a little bit of an investor takeaway. What's an auto stock that you like these days? Since it's obviously not Apple. (laughs) John Rosevear: I am an Apple shareholder. I love Apple! O'Reilly: Full disclosure. Rosevear: This is my Mac, this is my iPad -- O'Reilly: Oh, here we go. Rosevear: I actually got a gift for my 14th birthday many years ago, I got a share of Apple that's now over 100 shares because of all the splits that have happened in the 1980s and the 1990s. O'Reilly: And you never sold? Rosevear: I never sold, so I can still say, unless your last name is Wozniak, I've probably owned Apple stock longer than you have. Anyway, that said, I wouldn't buy Apple for a car stock right now. This market's slowing down. With that happening -- it's a cyclical market -- profits may be squeezed for a little while, but looking at a little longer term, I really like where General Motors is going. I like where [CEO] Mary Barra is going. I like that they are on top of this potentially disruptive technology. Their 200-mile electric car goes into production in a few weeks; it will be shipping before the end of the year. They're well ahead on the self-driving effort they're developing internally. They've bought Cruise Automation, which was a San Francisco start-up. They have this great thing where they let Cruise be Cruise, but they've given Cruise access to GM's resources and GM's deep opportunities. So that's progressing really quickly, and the Bolt will be the platform for their self-driving stuff. And meanwhile ... O'Reilly: They're making money. Rosevear: Yeah, they're making a lot of money right now. They're making money in China, they're doing well in Europe, and in the U.S., not only are they selling a lot of trucks and SUVs with $2 gas -- big profit margins -- but also, Barra has set rolling a number of initiatives to make sure that the margins stay fat as time goes on, as it perhaps becomes somewhat less profitable to sell trucks as you have to incorporate more technology to meet tightening regulations. For instance, one of the things that we talk about a lot is they're ramping up Cadillac. Luxury brands are very profitable. Cadillac was a joke for years, tufted velour seats built for elderly Americans -- no offense to elderly Americans. Those were nice cars, if that's what you wanted. But now, Cadillacs are moving upscale. They're much better built. And there's this long-term effort to elevate the brand, as well. It's already starting to show success. That's just one example. There's other things going on where they're cutting costs, they're making better use of their global scale. On top of that, GM is cheap, which means the dividend that they're paying is a 4.5% yield, give or take. You reinvest that through the ups and downs in the next few years, and as we get price appreciation as Barra's plans really start to show up on the bottom line in 2020 or 2022, somewhere around there, and you might be really happy.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search iPad Pro boosts Apple’s market share as tablet space shrinks Eric Abent - Oct 31, 2016 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit The tablet market may be shrinking a bit, but that could be good news for Apple’s share of it. A new report from Strategy Analytics shows Apple’s market share in the realm of tablets growing in Q3 2016 despite sales taking a small dip year-over-year. This, the firm says, was due to Apple’s iPad Pro, which is a tablet that can offer consumers a 2-in-1 experience. Strategy Analytics says that Apple’s tablet market share grew to 19.9% in Q3 2016, up from 19.1% in the same quarter a year ago. Though total sales slipped by about 600,000 iPads year-over-year, Apple’s average selling prices managed to climb by about 6%. That, again, is likely thanks to the more expensive iPad Pro. Losing out on those 600k sales means that Apple declined by 6% year-over-year, but that’s still better than the tablet market as a whole, which dropped 10%. The larger drop is evidenced in the Q3 performance of some of Apple’s competitors, with Samsung’s sales decreasing 17% from 7.9 million in Q3 ’15 to 6.6 million in Q3 2016. Lenovo felt the pinch too, as a decrease in 400,000 tablets meant that the company experienced an 11% decline year-over-year, slightly outpacing tablets as a whole. Not all manufacturers are on the decline though, with Huawei and Amazon being two notable standouts. Huawei showed year-over-year growth of 14%, while Amazon enjoyed triple-digit growth, settling at 119% year-over-year. Windows is also on the rise, thanks to Microsoft’s focus on 2-in-1 tablets that can serve as replacements for more traditional notebooks on the higher end. We’ll likely keep seeing manufacturers try their hand at the 2-in-1 space, as those seem to be gaining popularity with folks who need powerful machines to use as a daily driver, not just as a complement to their smartphone. It’ll be interesting to see what the numbers for Q4 2016 look like. With the holiday shopping season quickly approaching, one has to wonder if we’ll see this growth in Windows tablets increase or if Android will make a bit of a surge in terms of overall market share. With Android market share sitting at 65% and Windows at 16% and rising at the end of Q3, it’s Android’s game to lose and Windows’ to win.

The controversial new MacBook Pro makes us wonder whether Apple is still making its products for creative people. Anders Marshall - Oct 31, 2016 share 0 tweet 11 stumble 611 reddit 0 post pin it Tagged: Apple HARRISON Tim Cook said Apple has continued to redefine portable computing for 25 years. Then, last week, he showed the world Apple’s new MacBook Pro. “This is the new MacBook Pro,” Cook said. “And it’s absolutely incredible.” Then he showed us their most recent worst kept secret, dubbed the TouchBar. It’s a touchscreen strip that replaces the function keys. The first use we see in its unveiling is a scrolling GarageBand timeline as a song plays. Apple Special Event October 2016 (HD) | Macbook Pro 2016 Watch this video on YouTube I'm not concerned about myself, I'm concerned about people who are starting out. It seems like [Apple is] just trolling artists and manufacturers. HarrisonThe message is clear: “Look, music makers, we’re still thinking about you!” Except where are the ports? More specifically, where are the ports music makers rely on? The Macbook Pro does away with traditional USB ports (USB-A, the ones you’ve had on your computer since the ‘90s), and an SD card slot, to name a few. Four Thunderbolt 3 ports are their replacements. On its face, the change doesn’t present much of an issue. “Not to worry guys,” you imagine them saying, “you can use dongles for your old devices! We have four USB ports; that’s plenty for your creative endeavours!” Except Thunderbolt 3 uses USB-C, not the familiar USB-A to which music makers are so accustomed. Again, it might not seem like a big deal, unless this is where your creativity lives. And for many music makers, it is. To reinforce the idea that creative minds haven’t been forgotten, Apple brought up Karim Morsy, creator of djay, a controller app for MacOS. He did some fiddling on the touch bar to DJ, and played a very cool one-song set. Both hands were rubbing away at the top bit of the keyboard with abandon. Touch Bar lets DJs scratch and mix on their MacBooks (CNET News) Watch this video on YouTube This would all be cool and appropriate if it was made for the baby brother in Apple’s lineup, the 12 inch MacBook. But this is the MacBook Pro. What does the “pro” in its name mean? “What pissed me off the most is that they showed Photoshop, Final Cut and... djay Pro? What the hell?” Toronto electronic artist Harrison reacts in an interview. “I don't know a single DJ who uses that.” Apple’s digital audio workstation, Logic Pro, didn’t feature in their new laptop’s unveiling at all. The lack of ports supporting older musical instruments also weren’t mentioned. The most likely solution for buyers is to use adapters for older devices. Adapters work fine for transferring data traditionally, to a USB stick for example, but it poses a unique problem for playing music, particularly a live set: delayed signals. “It's a defendable thing, but [adapters] have latency issues. Especially if you don't have good USB hubs,” says Harrison. “I'm not concerned about myself, I'm concerned about people who are starting out. It seems like [Apple is] just trolling artists and manufacturers. I hope the transition to USB-C is quick so we can go about our lives.” Harrison - So Far From Home (feat. Young Guv) [Official Music Video] Watch this video on YouTube And forget about music makers for a second, what about listeners? If you own a new Macbook Pro and iPhone 7, you have some issues with headphones. The iPhone doesn’t have a headphone jack, it has Apple’s proprietary lightning port. They give you special headphones in the box to use with that iPhone, and make you buy an adapter to render regular wired headphones usable. Now, if you have wireless headphones, your issues are solved. But if you don’t, and want to go from listening to Beats1 on your iPhone 7 with your wired, lightning earbuds to listening on your MacBook, you need an adapter, or a different set of headphones. Apple products let you make, share, stream, download and listen to music offline. But there’s no simple way to do that in their new product line without a pocket full of accessories — accessories that are not cheap, are small, and presumably easy to lose or break. Apple Get a Mac ad - Angel/Devil (2006) Watch this video on YouTube Apple's branding has always been wrapped up in how creative people use their products. Apple has never had so much control over music, from creation, sharing, selling and everything in between. For many musicians, the company’s products have become nearly indispensable. Yet with their new product lineup, it’s becoming increasingly difficult to do it all easily.

The iOS 10.1.1 update contains little in the way of new features or bug fixes for the iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch. Rather, it addresses a single flaw that had in some cases caused a loss of the ability to view stored health data. This information includes things like steps walked, hours slept, weight and heart rates collected from connected wearables. Apple says that for those running iOS 10.1, the update will patch the bug, which had resulted in users reporting that after the 10.1 firmware was installed, they could no longer see their information stored in the Health app. Apple says that the 10.1.1 fix will once again let viewers see the data – which was not actually deleted but was hidden from user view. The update weighs in at a lean 64MB and can be downloaded through the iOS Software Update tool. For those who have not yet updated from iOS 10.0, Software Update will deliver the full 220MB iOS 10.1.1 package, including all of the updates from IOS 10.1 as well as the fixed (and visible) Health data. The iOS 10.1 update, released last week, included new features for the Photos, Maps, Messages and Apple Watch apps, as well as a number of bug fixes for stability issues in the mobile OS. It also included a sizeable payload of security fixes to patch critical vulnerabilities in the handling of JPEG files and web pages that would allow for remote code execution, and a handful of information disclosure vulnerabilities. Along with the iOS update, Apple posted fixes for security holes (in some cases the same issues present in iOS) for OS X, Apple Watch, and AppleTV. ® Sponsored: Transforming software delivery with DevOps Tips and corrections 4 Comments More from The Register 'Flaw' in iOS 10 private browsing... not as bad as it looks At least according to (indie) experts 4 Comments Apple to crunch iOS 10 local backup password brute force hole Research finds faster cracking flaw 17 Comments iCloud phishing attack hooks 39 iOS apps and WeChat Repacked malicious Xcode framework flogged on Chinese watering hole dev sites 21 Comments Bangladesh government domain turned into toxic phishing hole .gov.bd sites used by parties unknown to spawn phish from UK host 5 Comments Password-flogging phishing tool pwns EVERY iOS Mail app Cupertino quiet on pop-up of doom 4 Comments Apple's iOS updates brick iPads Update crushes low-level lockscreen hole ... then wreaks havoc 77 Comments Whitepapers Data and Analytics Maturity Model and Business Impact How top performing enterprises use their IT investments to store, process, and use data to make more effective, real-time decisions.

It's easy to assume that Silicon Valley has a corner on tech innovation. But China-based LeEco reminds us that it certainly does not. Chris Neiger (TMFNewsie) Oct 31, 2016 at 3:50PM Image source: LeEco. What if I told you Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) wasn't the first major smartphone company to ditch the 3.5 mm headphone jack? The Cupertino-based tech giant got a lot of flak while patting itself on the back for having the "courage" to ditch the old port, but the China-based electronics giant, LeEco, beat Apple to it over the summer (for better or worse) in not one, but three of its smartphones. And what if I told you that Matt Damon's next movie, The Great Wall, is being partially funded by that same Chinese tech player -- the same one that wants its new electric car to compete with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and has raised $1 billion to take on the company. LeEco (short for LeEcosystem) is not afraid to make bold claims against American tech companies, and its recent announcement that it's going to sell its full suite of hardware products in the U.S. means we're about to find out if it can really back up all the talk. Where LeEco wants to compete In short, LeEverywhere. The company made its name selling televisions, quite literally: It was officially known as LeTV until it recently changed its name. The company sells televisions under its own name in China, and over the summer expanded into the U.S. when it bought Vizio's TV division for $2 billion. As I mentioned before, it also makes smartphones. Its top of the line Le Pro 3 sports a 5.5-inch display and sells for just $400. It's cheaper Le S3 comes in at just $250, and both can tap into the company's own cloud service to boot.  One of LeEco's phones, the Le S3. Image source: LeEco. LeEco CEO Yueting Jia (who goes by YT Jia) hasn't shied away from sharing his thoughts on Apple's shortcomings. Earlier this year, he asserted that Apple was "outdated" and said, "In China, you can see that Apple has already begun to lose the rapid sales growth momentum." He went on to call Apple's innovation "extremely slow" and pointed to the iPhone SE as a failure to innovate.  OK, so Yueting's not too keen on Apple. But his company is also taking aim at Tesla. It unveiled the prototype for its electric car, LeSEE, back in April, and is investing over $1.8 billion to build a factory in China to manufacture them. That's in addition to the $1 billion it just raised in September to help develop the vehicle. LeEco says the plant will eventually reach an annual production of 400,000 vehicles, though it has not yet said when it expects the LeSEE will go into production. LeEco is convinced the American market is ready for its products. In a blog post, Jia said: In 2013, I visited the U.S. and was impressed with the influence of Hollywood as the birth place of culture and art, and the innovation that was happening in Silicon Valley. What was clear, though, was the lack of synergy between the entertainment and technology industries. Although the industrial specialization in the U.S. creates perfection in some areas, it has also put up rigid boundaries and divisions between industries, and has hindered innovation to a large extent. The company's electric car prototype, the LeSEE. Image source: LeEco. He's setting out to change that with his company -- and it'll be more than just dabbling in the U.S. market. LeEco has plans to hire 12,000 employees in Silicon Valley, up from just 500 right now. Its U.S. headquarters will be housed in a 48-acre complex it bought from Yahoo! for $250 million, and it plans to build its own 3 million square-foot facility soon as well Believe or not, this is a content play Despite all of its hardware devices, a car, and even an electric bike, LeEco is formidable content owner, and its underlying purpose in creating hardware and services is to bring that content to more screens.  In his U.S. launch blog post, Jia said that the company is focused on "... building a vertically integrated and open ecosystem that combines platform, content, devices and applications. Effectively, we are making it possible to seamlessly deliver content to any screen at any time." LeEco is focused on getting content into users' hands. Image source: LeEco. LeEco will use its video-subscription service and film production company to help with that, along with its library of 5,000 movies and 100,000 TV shows. The company doesn't own all of that content, but rather licenses it, just like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon do for much of their video content. And the company is making more deals all the time, with Lionsgate, MGM, Showtime and others topping its most recent content-partnership list.  "By integrating the best content with the best hardware through our EUI -- ecosystem user interface -- we are creating an 'Eco Lifestyle,' a truly connected experience and life," said Jia. It's still unclear whether or not that will model work in the U.S. or not. As research firm TrendForce wrote a few months ago: As most of its revenue comes from streaming video subscribers, LeEco intends to use the VIZIO brand to enter the North American market and replicate its business model there. However, LeEco will have more difficulty in getting subscribers in North America than in China due to competition from the region's major video streaming platforms such as Netflix. LeEco is small by many tech conglomerate standards. It brought in just $15 million in profit in the first quarter of this year. But with the company already expanding into Hong Kong, India and Russia, it's clear LeEco is bent on expanding its hardware and content synergies on a worldwide scale -- and now those synergies will be put to the ultimate test as the company tries to take on America's biggest tech giants.  Chris Neiger has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Follow TechnoBuffalo It’s more like a “Boooooooong.” Or maybe a hum. Every Mac owner recognizes Apple’s startup sound. It’s there to indicate your machine has successfully booted up. But with Apple’s new MacBook Pro, the company decided to ditch the chime altogether. You’d think Apple would replace the sound with something else but you’d be wrong. Now, there’s just silence. The change was first noticed by Pingie and later confirmed on a retail unit. As a side note, the MacBook Pro without Apple’s new Touch Bar is already available. That means we’re already living in a post-startup sound world. Apple’s startup chime has been part of the Mac experience for more than a decade, but now that chapter has come to a close. Really, the sound has become more than a nuisance than anything, making it all but impossible to turn your machine on without waking the entire neighborhood. There’s nothing more embarrassing than interrupting a quiet study session in the library with that sound. It’s the end of an era While the startup chime is gone, it’s unlikely MacBook Pro users will even notice. The new machines have been designed to turn on when opened, even when they’re fully turned off. So, the difference between startup and waking is only a matter of seconds. That means the experience is more like using an iPhone or iPad than a computer, where your device is instantly ready to go when awakened from sleep. Users of Google’s Chrome OS have known the joys of instant bootup for years. According to Apple’s trademark of the sound from 2012, the chime is described as “a synthesizer playing a slightly flat, by approximately 30 cents, G Flat / F Sharp major chord.” The sound will now live on in our hearts and memories. (For what it’s worth, people have already figured out how to bring the sound back with a simple Terminal command.)

Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) Oct 31, 2016 at 2:44PM As it becomes clearer that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is unlikely to ever turn Project Titan into an autonomous Apple-branded car of its own making, Motley Fool analyst Sean O'Reilly and senior auto specialist John Rosevear talk about a different auto company that's doing very well for itself: General Motors (NYSE:GM). Listen in to this clip from Industry Focus: Industrials to find out why long-term investors should look into this company. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Oct. 20, 2016. Sean O'Reilly: Before we head out, I always like to have a little bit of an investor takeaway. What's an auto stock that you like these days? Since it's obviously not Apple. (laughs) John Rosevear: I am an Apple shareholder. I love Apple! O'Reilly: Full disclosure. Rosevear: This is my Mac, this is my iPad -- O'Reilly: Oh, here we go. Rosevear: I actually got a gift for my 14th birthday many years ago, I got a share of Apple that's now over 100 shares because of all the splits that have happened in the 1980s and the 1990s. O'Reilly: And you never sold? Rosevear: I never sold, so I can still say, unless your last name is Wozniak, I've probably owned Apple stock longer than you have. Anyway, that said, I wouldn't buy Apple for a car stock right now. This market's slowing down. With that happening -- it's a cyclical market -- profits may be squeezed for a little while, but looking at a little longer term, I really like where General Motors is going. I like where [CEO] Mary Barra is going. I like that they are on top of this potentially disruptive technology. Their 200-mile electric car goes into production in a few weeks; it will be shipping before the end of the year. They're well ahead on the self-driving effort they're developing internally. They've bought Cruise Automation, which was a San Francisco start-up. They have this great thing where they let Cruise be Cruise, but they've given Cruise access to GM's resources and GM's deep opportunities. So that's progressing really quickly, and the Bolt will be the platform for their self-driving stuff. And meanwhile ... O'Reilly: They're making money. Rosevear: Yeah, they're making a lot of money right now. They're making money in China, they're doing well in Europe, and in the U.S., not only are they selling a lot of trucks and SUVs with $2 gas -- big profit margins -- but also, Barra has set rolling a number of initiatives to make sure that the margins stay fat as time goes on, as it perhaps becomes somewhat less profitable to sell trucks as you have to incorporate more technology to meet tightening regulations. For instance, one of the things that we talk about a lot is they're ramping up Cadillac. Luxury brands are very profitable. Cadillac was a joke for years, tufted velour seats built for elderly Americans -- no offense to elderly Americans. Those were nice cars, if that's what you wanted. But now, Cadillacs are moving upscale. They're much better built. And there's this long-term effort to elevate the brand, as well. It's already starting to show success. That's just one example. There's other things going on where they're cutting costs, they're making better use of their global scale. On top of that, GM is cheap, which means the dividend that they're paying is a 4.5% yield, give or take. You reinvest that through the ups and downs in the next few years, and as we get price appreciation as Barra's plans really start to show up on the bottom line in 2020 or 2022, somewhere around there, and you might be really happy.

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     Apple Scaling Down Their Car Project Posted: Oct 31 2016, 1:55pm CDT | by Scott Huntington, in News | Apple   photo: pocket-lint   There have been a lot of rumors about the Apple Car. Now we might have to wait even longer to see an automobile from the tech giant. Rumors about Apple’s foray into the automotive industry have been flying since several mysterious vans rigged with cameras were spotted driving around Northern California in February 2015. Don't Miss: Best Amazon Black Friday 2016 Deals Apple is reportedly now focusing solely on building software for self-driving vehicles, as opposed to also working on a manufacturing a car itself. This frees Apple up to either partner with an existing car manufacturer or restart work on its own vehicles in the future.  Apple either laid off of transferred to other Apple sectors hundreds of the estimated 1,000 employees working on Apple’s car project, an undertaking often referred to as “Project Titan.” The remaining workers purportedly must prove the achievability of the project by late 2017 when Apple will decide what the next step in the venture will be (and, possibly, whether it will continue working on automotive technology at all). Some have speculated that Apple probably stepped back from Project Titan, because of the difficulty of the manufacturing and the smaller profit margins of the auto industry. Mass-producing vehicles is extremely intensive. Apple is, of course, not experienced in vehicle production and would have needed to invest huge sums of money into developing their manufacturing process. An Apple car may not have been profitable enough to make such an investment worthwhile. Automobile manufacturers work with much smaller profit margins than Apple is used to, another factor that may have led the tech giant from to slow down their car making plans. A successful automaker may have an operating profit margin of 10%, a small slice of the margins on an iPhone.  Apple was an innovator in the consumer electronics field, something that contributed significantly to the company’s success. In the auto industry, however, there are of course already many very successful, established manufacturers meaning Apple would need to do a lot more to set itself apart.  Even in the world of autonomous vehicles, competition is already fierce. Technology companies like Google and Uber have been working on self-driving cars and have partnered with several established automakers. Many traditional car companies, such as Ford, BMW and Toyota are also working on their own autonomous vehicles. Many of these companies are aiming to have the technology ready by around 2020. Companies such as Apple face innumerable challenges when trying to break into the auto industry and implement new technology for vehicles. How these companies, as well as established automakers, choose to confront these challenges will change the way we travel significantly in the not-so-distant future.

Daily Deals: Amazon Echo $120, 23-inch HP display $87, and more   skip to main content skip to main menu     Brief history of the Mac startup chime By Christian Zibreg, Oct 31, 2016 Tweet 7 Comments The new MacBook Pro does away with the classic Mac startup sound that’s been present on Macs for the past seventeen years, probably to avoid annoying users as the notebook automatically powers on when you open the lid. But rather than completely kill the chime, Apple’s disabled it on the new MacBook Pro. Thankfully, you can re-enable it with a simple Terminal command. We think this could mark gradual phasing-out of the familiar Mac startup sound just as the one-port MacBook with USB-C has spelled doom for Apple’s proprietary but love MagSafe connector. Here’s a brief history of the Mac boot chime. History of the Mac startup chime An excerpt from the Mac startup chime entry on Wikipedia: The Macintosh startup chime is a single note or chord simply known as “the startup sound”. The sound used differs depending on the ROM, which greatly varies depending on model type. This short sound is played when an Apple Macintosh computer is turned on. The sound indicates that diagnostic tests run immediately at startup have found no hardware or fundamental software problems. The Mac startup chime as we know it made its debut on the 1993 iMac G3. Different versions of the startup sound have been present on the Mac since the Macintosh II. Here’s a YouTube video with some of the Mac startup sounds over the years. Pingie has more on the boot chime history: Over the years the chime has changed. The first being a “bong.” Quadras brought in a chord composed in a C major on a Korg keyboard. It was pitch shifted a few times. Power Macs brought in an electronic jazz guitar strum. The 20th Anniversary Macintosh had a poppy remix of the classic bong as a tribute to the original Mac. But all Mac computers post the iMac G3 have had the same sound – an F-Sharp cord sound modulated from a PowerMac startup sound. And here are all Mac startup and crash sounds. And here’s the complete interview Dutch blog One More Thing did with Jim Reekes, the composer of the Mac startup sound, in which he talks about the creation of that sound, his work on Quicktime and other audio features we take for granted on the Mac. You can also download an archive of all the Mac startup and crash sounds from Pingie, if you wish. After the ZIP file has finished downloading to your Mac, open it from your Downloads folder to unpack it. You should be presented with a series of sound files in the Finder, as shown below. Open a file to listen to any particular Mac startup sound or select the file and press the Spacebar key to preview it even faster with the Mac’s built-in Quick Look feature. As mentioned earlier, Apple hasn’t removed the iconic boot chime from the new MacBook Pro completely. For owners of the late-2016 MacBook Pro who’d like to bring back the startup sound, a simple Terminal workaround will do the trick. To disable the boot chime on other Macs permanently, check out Anthony’s tutorial. To disable the startup tone temporarily, mute the sound on your Mac with the mute key on the keyboard. When you do this, the computer’s volume will be silenced and this means the startup tone will also be silenced until you un-mute your Mac’s volume. Are you saddened that Apple’s turned off the boot chime by default on the new Pro? And while we’re at it, is this a one-off thing because the new Pro automatically powers on when the lid is open or a sign of things to come to other Mac models, do you think? Meet us in comments! Share: Tweet Follow: Follow @iDownloadBlog We Recommend New MacBook Pro doesn’t play classic startup chime when turned on Reviewers weigh in on the new MacBook Pro… Apple spent years testing if touchscreens made sense on the Mac Microsoft is bringing integrated developer environment Visual Studio to the Mac Related Topics Apple, Mac, News, Sound techfreak23 The new Pros turning on automatically when you open up the lid doesn’t justify the disabling of the chime. Unless the computers shuts down every time you close the lid, you wouldn’t hear the chime any more than you did before. There must be a technical reason for it or Apple just wanted to do something different. Who knows? Bruh It’s maybe because if you are in a meeting and you are opening your mac it’s not so distracting for everyone. But I think they should add a better visible and public way to reactivate it. techfreak23 Yeah I understand those situations, but you can mute your computer before you shut it down so that it doesn’t go off on boot up. Maybe it’s just to make it more consistent with iOS devices, since they have never had a boot up chime and Apple has recently been adding certain sounds from iOS to macOS. Donato Bearint Yea there’s a big mystery why they got rid of a sound, it’s a technical enigma! Right. It’s a sound easily enabled or disabled in terminal. There’s not more to it then the new MacBook boots up just about as fast as waking it up from sleep. The sound would be an annoyance every time someone opened up there computer. No more to it then that. techfreak23 But that’s my point, if it only does it during boot up and if closing the lid doesn’t shut off the computer, you wouldn’t hear the chime anymore than you do now. Unless you’re the type of person that shuts your computer down every time before you close it, which is absolutely ridiculous and actually doesn’t help with battery life if you’re doing it multiple times per day. Donato Bearint A lot of people Shut off there computer when they aren’t using it. It’s a simple command, anyone that thinks that apple removed a sound due to the fact of the implementation of some secret software implement is stupid. A sound could not make room for anything more or stop anything from being implemented. It has no bearing on anything.

October 31 AAPL: 113.54 -0.18 As we await Apple’s AirPods, these are the best wireless cord-free earbuds available Jordan Kahn - 2 weeks ago @JordanKahn iPhone 7 AirPods headphones View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Apple delayed the release of its new truly wireless earbuds called AirPods that it originally planned on launching in late October. It’s disappointing for some who wanted to use them with their new iPhone 7 that launched back in September. But what does the competition look like? With the AirPods originally expected to launch sometime this month, right around the time of Apple’s MacBook Pro event and Apple Watch Nike+ launch last week, a lot of accessory makers have been planning launches to time and compete with Apple’s new wireless earbuds. Just this week a few new products launched, including Michigan-based Sol Republic’s first cord-free product called ‘Amps Air’, and today Best Buy is launching new $249 Skybuds that claim to offer 24 hours battery with an included charging case and improved connectivity. If you just can’t wait for the AirPods, or want to check out the competition and see how Apple’s earbuds compare, these are the alternatives…   A few things to consider before we jump in… Apple’s AirPods will utilize its new W1 chip, just like the latest Beats line. From our early hands-on tests, that means they will have superior connectivity and pairing. That’s a big deal. Currently, just about every set of Bluetooth headphones, cord-free or not, experience hiccups with connectivity. In real world usage for non-W1 headphones, that means opening the Settings app and pairing manually in Bluetooth settings while maybe having to power the headphones on and off to enable pairing mode. Most of them attempt to offer an automatic pairing experience after initial setup, but it’s frustrating when they fail. Form factor is going to be a big differentiator for AirPods. Just take a look at the competition. Even the bullet-shaped ones that appear smaller stick out of the ear more than you might expect. The other option is a flatter but hearing aid-looking design that many others are using. Apple’s AirPods are priced competitively at $159 for what you get with battery life and pairing, audio quality aside. Erato Launched earlier this summer, Apollo 7 by Erato ($299) is one of the better reviewed truly wireless earbud options on the market, but it’s also one of the most expensive at $300 USD. They don’t get glowing reviews for having outstanding sound quality either, but overall users who can stomach the price are happy apart from the less than stellar mic and audio quality for calls. But that’s par-for-the-course for these types of earbuds so far. Expect around four hours of battery life with a 300 mAh charging case that will give you a few extra charges. You can expect the usual Bluetooth pairing issues (they won’t always just work) and lag in certain situations for video. At $299, they are hardly competing with Apple’s AirPods at half the price… Sol Republic Just launched last week on what would have been the same day as the AirPods, the new Sol Republic Amps Air offer some of the best audio quality we’ve tested, something that is often lacking in wireless earbuds and not something that is expected to improve much with Apple’s AirPods. If you can put up with slightly bulkier package– in-ear shots availabile in our full review here— then these might prove to be a better option than AirPods if audio quality is your main concern. Despite being a bit big in the ear, we found them comfortable and overall some of the better cord-free earbuds for the price. The magnetic charging case works well, they are sweat-resistant, plus they get three hours listen time and an extra 45 on-the-go with the charging case. At $179, they might be worth the upgrade in sound quality over AirPods, and possibly comfort too depending on your ear. Skybuds  Launching today at Best Buy, Skybuds ($249) promise four hours battery life and a charging case that gives an extra 24 hours listening time on-the-go. And they come in what looks like a relatively slim package compared to a lot of the other competition with similar specs. What the press release doesn’t mention is audio quality, but early user reviews have been overall positive. At $249, they’ll have to sound pretty good too in order to make them competitive with Sol Republic and the other guys. We’re expecting a review unit shortly. Samsung Samsung’s Gear Icon X (ugh, enough with the singular names for cord-free earbuds) have 4GB built-in storage for music and a heart rate monitor plus other fitness tracking features. They get a max 3.8 hrs of listening time, but much less in some cases. Replaceable small, medium, and large tips and wings are a plus if getting a good fit is often an issue for you. The charging case will charge them twice while on the go. They get decent reviews as far as sound quality goes, but don’t expect to be blown away, and most reviews note a myriad of issues with everything apart from charging and sound. At $199 currently, they will be a premium over Apple’s $159 AirPods at launch.  Jabra Launched this month at Best Buy, Jabra’s new $249 Elite Spot earbuds are IP67 rated for waterproofing and Jabra says you should get around 3 hours listening time and an additional 6 hours while on-the-go from charging with the included portable case with built-in battery. There is also an in-ear heart rate monitor that is supposed to offer “90%+ accuracy” and a companion app for viewing the data.  Motorola VerveOnes+ Waterproof earbuds Motorola debuted these new VerveOnes+ earbuds a few months ago and overall they’ve been getting solid reviews. You get 3-4 hrs playback with an additional 12 hours on the go via the recharging case with built-in battery. $180 for the standard version, $249 for the waterproof edition.  Rowkin The Rowkin Bit Charge have a growing following among those after the smallest, bullet-shaped form factor possible at a price lower than the Erato’s above. They cost $129 (you can buy a single unit for $69), but the trade-off is not-so-great audio quality and only three hours or less listening time on a single charge. Like many of the others, the charging case will give you up to 15 extra charges while on the move. Earin A promising compact form factor, we had a decent experience with these $199 earbuds from Earin, but they aren’t without the usual Bluetooth connectivity issues and the sound quality is nothing to brag about. They offer three hours of playback on a single charge and an extra three charges with the case’s built-in battery. Our full review is here. Bragi Bragi received some attention for “The Dash”, one of the first cord-free earbuds to hit the market a year back. But they didn’t get great reviews at $300, mostly because the company crammed in fitness tracking features and sensor-based touch controls that didn’t work that well. The company has since announced a new product– The Headphone— that removes those features and aims to fix connectivity issues with the first generation product. They will cost $149 at launch next month, but the verdict is still out on performance. Currently up for pre-order from the company for $119. Take a look at the W1 pairing process, which will greatly improve connectivity and pairing on the AirPods and across other Apple devices from our hands-on with the new Beats Solo3 below: Guides iPhone 7 Apple's iPhone 7 and 7 Plus were announced on 7th September 2016 View THe Guide Apple AirPods Apple AirPods price, availability, features View THe Guide headphones View THe Guide blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

Sharp executive Tai Jeng-wu essentially confirmed the next iPhone's hardware upgrade in a recent trip to his alma mater, Tatung University in Taiwan, according to Japan's Nikkei Asian Review. Mr. Jeng-wu also happens to be an executive at Sharp's parent company Hon Hai Precision Industry (better known as Foxconn Technology Group), so that puts him in a unique position to know what Apple is working on. Foxconn, of course, is a critical iPhone part supplier and assembler. "The iPhone has been evolving and now it is switching from LTPS (low-temperature poly-silicon) to OLED panels," said Jeng-wu at Tatung University according to the report. "We don't know whether Apple's OLED iPhones will be a hit, but if Apple doesn't walk down this path and transform itself, there will be no innovation. It is a crisis but it is also an opportunity." His remarks come in the wake of Apple's first annual sales decline since 2001. Analysts are blaming the lack of innovative features for the weakening demand of the iPhone. Apple has been rumored to be exploring OLED technology for most of the year, but Jeng-wu's latest remarks are the closest thing we have to an official confirmation. Apple has decline to comment on the matter. "We are now building a new [OLED] facility in Japan," said Jeng-Wu according to the report. "We can make [OLED panels] in the US too. If our key customer demands us to manufacture in the US, is it possible for us not to do so?" It should be no surprise that Apple and Sharp are exploring OLED technology. Apple's chief rival Samsung uses OLED's in both the S7 Edge and Note 7 phones. The displays are preferred to LCD screens (which the iPhone currently uses) because they offer sharper color contracts and brighter colors. Another huge benefit of OLED displays is their ability to flex, allowing manufacturers to bend the screens around the edge of the device or even create foldable models. In essence, the OLED's are way more durable and are practically shatter-proof. Although Jeng-wu did not specify when iPhones would finally switch to OLED displays, it's widely expected to start next year. The Nikkei Asian Review has previously reported Apple will release three new iPhones next year including a high-end model with a 5.5-inch (or larger) OLED display that features curves on both sides of the phone, just like the Samsung Galaxy S7. Well-known Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has also said the new OLED display will be curved and feature a glass casing similar to the iPhone 4. So now, we have two very credible sources saying Apple will begin using OLED's in the iPhone. If history has taught us anything, Cupertino won't be saying anything until September, when it historically has released its next-generation iPhone. If you're in the new market for a new phone, I wouldn't wait. The iPhone 7 is a great phone, and it's hard to imagine a new display making it that much better.

This research report also lists 31 other prominent vendors that are expected to impact the market during the forecast period. The global wrist wearable market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 10.89% in terms of shipment and 10.94% in terms of revenue during the forecast period. Apple and Samsung are the leading manufacturers of wrist wearable devices in the market as of 2016. According to Ujjwal Doshi, a lead consumer electronics research analyst at Technavio, "With sports apparel and fitness brands such as Nike and Adidas launching smart wrist gear that can monitor the aesthetic sense of users apart from monitoring health parameters, wearable devices are expected to establish themselves as style statements and not just computing devices." Competitive vendor landscape The global wrist wearable market is expected to grow at a rapid rate in the future. It is a fragmented and competitive market with an increasing number of new vendors entering the market with low entry barriers. Vendors are using innovative marketing strategies to sell their product. The leading vendor, Fitbit, has already maintained a strong foothold in the market and hence, there will be no drastic changes among the leading vendors and their position in the market. However, new entrants like Xiaomi may be a threat to the existing leading vendors in the future.

Samsung Electronics Samsung manufactures home appliances, semiconductors, telecommunication products, and digital media products in South Korea and internationally. Samsung Gear is a line of wearable computing devices produced by Samsung. The first Samsung Gear was launched in September 2013, which was an Android-based smartwatch, which was followed by Tizen-based Gear 2 and the Gear Fit activity tracker, which were launched in 2014.

Today we found out, what Apple spent their time on and TL;DR: it filled me with a reptilian urge. As someone who loves this company, I’m starting to worry that they are resting on their laurels and unable to make the hard decisions they were always known for. There’s no doubt that we’re in an awkward phase of pro computing. If you’re Apple, Google, or Microsoft, it’s a tough question: How do you take the most compelling aspects of visual multitouch and integrate them in a pro mouse and keyboard interface? Combining these interfaces is awkward and challenging but Microsoft has given it a shot. The Surface started as a fairly elaborate mess but has gotten better with time. They eventually introduced a solid tablet/laptop combo called the Surface Book, then yesterday, Microsoft released a product that left many spellbound. So, four years later, while Microsoft shipped and iterated on multiple Surface designs, we get this multi touch sliver from Apple. Apple There are certainly some fun aspects of the Touch Bar. It looks pretty and has a few minor, amusing use cases but honestly WTF. In the thousands of interviews Apple did with creative professionals about their computer needs, how many of them said, 'You know what! What I really want is a small sliver above my keyboard that I can touch and receive error messages on! Can you imagine how many hours Apple poured into this? How many Apple teams had to work together to make this happen? How much it had to pressure partners into making something custom for this for demo day? And for what? How does this move the needle in any meaningful way for creative pros? It’s worth mentioning at this point that the 2015 MacBook Pro I’m writing this on is the finest computer I’ve ever owned. The trackpad, keyboard, and OS are all refined in a way no one else comes close. But when it comes to the 3D creative work I need to do, its a well shaped paperweight. Working with HTC Vive, Oculus, or high end 3D graphics "requires" an obscene GPU. There might be some hacky way to do it with USB C but Apple appears to give no fucks. The MacBook Pro Tool Bar is a scab. It's a glaring, congealed distillation of Apple’s disconnect with the creatives it was so famous for previously supporting. I’ve had no choice but to buy a Windows machine for work and it seems that will be the case going forward. *** Cody Brown is the founder of the VR production studio IRL and Roomscale.org.

Beth McKenna (TMFMcKenna) Oct 31, 2016 at 1:26PM Cash-cow stocks like Apple and Facebook often make for winning investments. Image source: Getty Images.  Investors can often find stock market winners by looking for companies that generate a lot of cash on a consistent basis. A strong free cash flow – which is the cash that a company generates from its operations that is left over after it makes necessary investments in its business – enables a company to pay dividends, buy back shares of its stock, and grow the business via acquisitions and in other ways. Having plenty of cash coming in is important for all companies, but especially ones involved in technology, where the ability to invest in innovation and fast growth is especially critical.   There's no single factor that qualifies a company as a "cash cow," but such companies will generally have a high free cash margin, which is the percentage of revenue converted into cash, and/or a high cash return on invested capital, which reflects how good a company is at turning capital into cash and is calculated by dividing free cash flow by invested capital. Two companies that fit the bill are Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).  The iCash Cow Apple's cash flow soared upon the introduction of the iPhone in 2007. Image source: Apple. Apple's name is practically synonymous with "cash cow," which is largely due to the immense popularity of the iPhone. Over the 12 months through its most recent fiscal fourth quarter, the tech superstar generated free cash flow of $52.28 billion on revenue of $215.65 billion, which equates to a cash margin of 24.2%. Apple's cash return on invested capital is likewise standout, clocking in at 25.8%. While this is still a very impressive number, it has come down over the last year. This probably reflects to some degree that it often simply gets more difficult to generate higher and higher returns on invested capital as a company's cash stash builds up. However, more meaningfully, it also no doubt reflects Apple's declining free cash flow due to declining sales of the iPhone.  AAPL Free Cash Flow (TTM) data by YCharts. Over the last few quarters, Apple's year-over-year revenue has declined because quarterly year-over-year sales of the iPhone have declined, as the iconic smartphone accounts for about two-thirds of the company's top line. As is generally typical, a decline in revenue has hurt both the bottom line -- or net income -- as well as free cash flow.  The iDevice maker is going to have to increase iPhone sales and/or introduce another killer product in order for FCF to start moving up once again. iPhone sales might soon get that boost due to September's launch of the iPhone 7, which was surrounded by a good amount of positive buzz, combined with rival Samsung halting production of its Galaxy Note 7 smartphone in early October due to several phones overheating and catching on fire. The social-networking cash-generating machine Facebook's headquarters. Image source: Facebook. What's particularly impressive about Facebook is that it's generated a positive free cash flow ever since going public in 2012. Moreover, its free cash flow is at an all-time high, as the chart below shows. FB Free Cash Flow (TTM) data by YCharts. Over the trailing 12 months through the second quarter (the company reports Q3 earnings after the market closes on Nov. 2), the social-networking giant generated free cash flow of $7.66 billion on revenue of $22.16 billion, which equates to an amazingly fat cash margin of 34.3%. To put this number in context, Apple's cash margin, as a reminder, is 24.2%, while Google parent Alphabet's and IBM's cash margins are 24.4% and 18%, respectively.  Facebook's cash return on invested capital for the same time period is 17.1% -- this is a very solid number, but it does fall short of Apple's 25.8%, so despite its current struggles with the iPhone, Cupertino remains better than Facebook at turning invested capital into cash. This is by no means a negative for Facebook, as the company's core cash-cow Facebook platform is still growing nicely, with monthly active users (MAUs) rising 15% year over year to 1.71 billion in the second quarter. Moreover, Facebook owns some potentially lucrative platforms and other IP that it's yet to monetize or is in the very early stages of monetizing, including WhatsApp, Messenger, Instagram, and its 2014 virtual and augmented reality acquisition, Oculus VR. Wall Street has heady expectations for Facebook's continued revenue and earnings growth, which should bode well for its free cash flow growth as well. Analysts expect year-over-year earnings per share to jump 72.4% this year and grow at an average annual rate of 35.1% over the next five years.   Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

At least, the non-mobile divisions that are looking to win over more iPhone supply orders from Apple. Specifically, the two Korean giants are embroiled in a “do or die” battle for Apple’s attention concerning a critical component for the iPhone 8 and its successors. DON’T MISS: Apple should kill the iPhone’s Lightning port next Samsung Display and LG Display have invested $11.6 billion (13 trillion won) in flexible OLEDs this year, Business Korea reports. The whole purpose of their actions is to win iPhone OLED screen orders from Apple. The iPhone maker could turn out to be a driving force for OLED display adoption now that it’s considering such displays for its flagship products. OLED screens have constantly beaten LCD displays, according to experts, but Apple never made a move to OLED for the iPhone, choosing to improve the LCD performance instead. But at least one iPhone 8 model next year will have an OLED display, and Sharp seems already comfortable confirming the feature. Samsung's display division invested 5.9 trillion won in OLED facilities so far this year, and the total will reach 10.9 trillion won ($9.7 billion) by the end of the year. Samsung Display’s new facilities will mass-produce OLED screens for smartphones, tablets, and notebooks. LG invested 4.5 trillion won this year, half of which is going to flexible OLED displays. The site notes that Apple is expected to launch an OLED iPhone next year. The display industry says that Apple may need some 100 million OLED panels this year beginning in 2018 when half of its iPhones will have OLED displays. Samsung display is said to win all iPhone 8 OLED orders going forward. But LG will be able to mass-produce flexible OLED displays in the first half of next year. It’s not clear what iPhone model LG is targeting, but Business Korea says the company is “having a tug of war over the supply of OLED panels from E5 Line to the iPhone 5 with Apple.” Does that mean the iPhone SE will also get an OLED panel in a future update?

The revelation comes amid concerns that advances in battery technology have failed to keep pace with increasingly sophisticated phones, tablets and other gadgets. All the apps, cameras, video streaming, web browsing and GPS mapping services available with modern smartphones puts an enormous strain on the batteries. Some modern smartphones will die after just three hours of browsing the web, according to a study of battery life (stock image) The recent Samsung fiasco involving its 'exploding' Galaxy Note 7 smartphones was the direct result of a systematic battery failure. Specifically, a new fast charge technology that was designed to counter concerns about the handset's batteries dying too quickly was not robust enough. A spokesman for UK consumer group Which? said: 'The estimated figure of how much the recalled Samsung Galaxy Note 7 mobile will cost the manufacturer varies wildly from $2 billion to as much as $18 billion'. BATTERY LIFE LEAGUE   Smartphone Battery life Best: HTC 10 (£470/$699) 1,859 mins talk time; 13 hours (approx) browsing Worst: EE Rook (£40) 420 mins talk time; 187 minutes (approx) browsing Tablet Best: Samsung Galaxy Tab A 9.7 (£189/$299) 16 hours Worst: Acer Iconia B1-710 (£84.99/$145) 3 hours Laptop Best: Toshiba Satellite Click 10 (£274.99/$349) 11 hours video Worst: Asus Zenbook Pro UX501 (£1,300/$1499) under 3 hours video Bluetooth speaker Best: Ultimate Ears Megaboom (£170/$240) 2,259 minutes Worst: Bose SoundTouch Portable Series II (£270/$280) 165 minutes Wireless headphones Best: Sony MDR-ZX330BT (£49.99/$68) 44.5 hours Worst: Skullcandy XTplyo (£28.68/$34) under 5 hours 'What we do know is that it's all down to that key component of any smartphone – the battery.' The consumer group has put together its own guide to the handsets, tablets, laptops, Bluetooth speakers and wireless headphones that offer the best and worst battery life.

Which? said: 'Our lab tests found that it will take a mighty 1,859 minutes of continuous talk time before its battery finally runs out of juice – that's a minute shy of 31 hours. The Taiwanese company's flagship handset has a 5.2-inch display and a 12Mp main camera. 'Like most premium phones on the market today, it has a fingerprint reader for added security, as well as a micro-SD card slot if you need a little more room for songs and snaps than the 32GB on-board storage allows.' While Apple and Samsung may dominate smartphone technology and sales, these mega tech brands come behind the HTC 10, which costs £470, in terms of battery life. By contrast it said the budget Rook smartphone from EE, which admittedly costs just £40 for UK buyers, had a browsing time of around 187 minutes before it went dark. Talk time was an equally miserly at seven hours. Which? said: 'OK, so it won't spontaneously explode in your face, but the EE Rook's dreadful battery life is the very worst on test.'

Worst was the Acer Iconia B1-710, which costs less than £100 ($145) in most outlets. Which? warned: 'The three or so hours of battery life you get is frankly pathetic.' The Toshiba Satellite Click 10 laptop scored well on battery longevity at around 11 hours for movie marathons, and more than 12 for continuous web surfing over Wi-Fi. It managed to beat the Asus Zenbook Pro UX501, which is more than three times the price yet managed a battery life of just two and a half hours. The best Bluetooth speaker was the Ultimate Ears Megaboom.  The best Bluetooth speaker was the Ultimate Ears Megaboom. Which? said: 'It keeps going for a massive 2,259 minutes, or just shy of 38 hours.

That's enough time to listen to the entire back catalogue of Beatles studio albums – four times in a row.' At the other end of the scale was the 165 minutes for the Bose SoundTouch Portable Series II. 'That will barely be enough to get you through Justin Bieber's oeuvre,' said Which?. The best wireless headphones for battery life were the Sony MDR-ZX330BT at an astonishing 44.5 hours. The worst was Skullcandy XTplyo at less than five hours.  URINE BATTERY COULD POWER HANDSETS FOR 3 HOURS  British scientists have created a new way to charge smartphones - using urine. Researchers have revealed a new system which transforms urine into electricity using a microbial fuel cell. Just over half a litre of urine is enough for six hours of charge time, which can power a smartphone for three hours. The units contain bacteria that breaks down the chemicals in urine, in the process releasing energy in the form of electricity which is stored on a capacitor within a fuel cell. 'The microbial fuel cells (MFC) work by employing live microbes which feed on urine for their own growth and maintenance,' explained Professor Ioannis Ieropoulos. 'The MFC is, in effect, a system which taps a portion of that biochemical energy. 'This technology is about as green as it gets, as we do not need to utilise fossil fuels and we are effectively using a waste product that will be in plentiful supply.'

However, it has absolutely huge potential to finally bring VR to the masses. Welcome Home: Google's $130 smart speaker Google's smart Home speaker still has a lot of learning to do, and loses out to Amazon's Echo in some areas - but has incredible potential 'Not quite an iPhone replacement': Google's Pixel phone Google's Pixel handset is good, and boasts an amazing camera and smart assistant.

But that doesn’t mean just because you can, you will, or will want to use Apple Pay in the future. RELATED ARTICLE How to Shop with Apple Pay on macOS Sierra If you don’t use Apple Pay (or even if you do) and you don’t want websites to inquire as to whether you have the service set up on your iPhone, then you can turn off the ability for website to check. On your iPhone, first open the Settings and then tap “Safari”. In Safari’s settings, scroll down to the options under Privacy & Security and tap off “Check for Apple Pay”. On MacOS, open Safari’s preferences from the Safari menu or by pressing Command+, on your keyboard. In the settings, click on the “Privacy” tab and then turn off the option at the bottom “Allow websites to check if Apple Pay is set up”. Keep in mind, just because you disable this option doesn’t mean you can’t use Apple Pay. It just means any website that supports Apple Pay cannot poll your devices and suggest it as a payment option. This is just one of those features that Apple has included for added convenience as well as broaden Apple Pay’s adoption. Thankfully, you can safely disable it without breaking anything vital.

Best iPhone and iPad accessories to pimp your Apple device T3 31/10/2016 Spencer Hart From cases to flying machines, the world of app-controlled toys and smartphone add-ons just keeps growing. So amid all the noise, what are the best iPhone accessories to buy in 2016 to help you get the most from your iOS device? Accessories can add so much to your Apple device, whether it's letting you ditch the onscreen keyboard with a Bluetooth version for your iPad, giving your iPhone 7 an extra hit of battery or streaming 360-degree video. Here's our pick of the Apple add-ons that'll ensure you never leave your house without your iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad ever again. Also check out our guide to the best Mac apps © Provided by Future Publishing Ltd. Logitech Keys to Go Typing out long emails on the iPad’s touchscreen is tolerable, but hardly fun. If you really want to turn the slate into a productivity tool, you’ll need to pair it with it a keyboard. Our pick is Logitech’s Keys to Go (yeah, we know the name is bad), which takes everything we love about Microsoft’s Surface Type Cover and brings it to the iPad. It’s compact, waterproof and very durable, plus the battery lasts for ages and the keys, while they don’t have much give, are pleasant to type on. © Provided by Future Publishing Ltd. OlloClip This handy clip on attachment adds some extra functionality to the awesome camera on the iPhone 5, by allowing you to take fish-eye, wide-angle and macro snaps. No extra app is needed, so you can use it with the regular camera app or Instagram and it only takes a few seconds to attach. © Provided by Future Publishing Ltd. Mujjo Leather Wallet Sleeve This simple, elegant sleeve from Mujjo is great if you don't want you iPhone to be constantly encased in plastic. It's cut from a single piece of vegetable-tanned leather, and includes space for three cards. If you're looking for more cases, check out the best iPhone 7 cases, or best iPhone 6 cases © Provided by Future Publishing Ltd. Ullu Wally Ullu first caught our eye with its luxurious leather Apple Watch straps, but it also makes very attractive iPhone cases. The company's newest offering, the Wally, is hand-crafted from premium Italian leather, and includes pockets for cash and credit cards. It comes in 19 colours, and doesn't break the bank. © Provided by Future Publishing Ltd. Native Union Dock+ Lightning This stylish, minimal charging dock makes it appear as if your iPhone is floating. We love it, and think it’s one of the best looking docks we’ve seen. The Dock+ works with most cases, and is as solid as a rock. © Provided by Future Publishing Ltd. Mophie Juice Pack Air We love Mophie's range of backup battery iPhone cases, and our pick of the range is the Juice Pack Air, which has a larger battery than the Reserve, but it's smaller than the Plus, making it the perfect balance of capacity and heft. Goldilocks. Battery size is 2,750mAh, which is more than 100-percent extra battery capacity. © Provided by Future Publishing Ltd. Joby GripTight GorillaPod The iPhone 7 may have optical image stabilisation, but if you want really clear night shots, or even a selfie where your arm isn’t outstretched - you’ll want a tripod. The most adaptable tripods around are from Joby, it can be tied around railings, or hung from a tree. © Provided by Future Publishing Ltd. Zeiss VR One GX VR is all the rage right now, all the big Android manufacturers are jumping aboard the bandwagon, but if you’re an iPhone user, you’re shit outta luck (if you want an official VR headset from Apple, that is). Thankfully there are plenty of third party handsets available, ranging from £12 to £120. Our pick if obviously at the more expensive end of the scale, with a solid build and premium Zeiss optics. © Provided by Future Publishing Ltd.

The instantly recognisable sound has been consigned to the dustbin of tech history after over twenty years of greeting users. Apple 7 The new MacBook Pro has lost its chime in the latest update to the device The California based computing giant has dropped the F-sharp chord and now the computer simply soundlessly comes to life. Tech website Pingie.com revealed the change after examining a FAQ page for the new MacBook and then confirming it on a working model. The sound became such an iconic noise that it even featured in the Disney Pixar animated movie Wall-E. Apple also registered a trademark for the sound in 2012, which describes it as “a synthesizer playing a slightly flat, by approximately 30 cents, G Flat / F Sharp major chord.” Alamy 7 The “Mac chime” joins the the iPhone headphone jack in the dustbin of tech history following the latest update Although the company has yet to comment on the alteration, the change makes sense given that the latest MacBook Pro automatically boots up when opened. The radical reinvention of the device saw the traditional USB ports being killed off along with the function keys which were replaced with a smart touch screen.

In a statement given to the site, an Apple spokesperson said that prices were set based on “several factors”. They include “currency exchange rates, local import laws, business practices, taxes, and the cost of doing business”. Getty Images 7 The pound has crashed against the dollar in the wake of Britain’s vote to leave the EU. Its latest exchange rate has fallen by as much as 27p to the dollar — a drop of over 18 per cent. The Sun Online has contacted Apple UK to comment. The new £1,499 MacBook Pro will come with either a 13 inch or 15 inch screen and will be the thinnest ever made, with the smaller model weighing just three pounds with a thickness of 14.9 mm.

I can say something about this, because it’s happened to me too. On Friday I installed the 10.1 update on my new iPhone 7, which had arrived the previous day and was so far working flawlessly. Transferring the data from my old iPhone 5 and pairing my Watch had taken place without incident. But on Saturday morning I noticed that my Health data — which goes back two years — was missing. So was my Activity data, which goes back to April (when I bought the Watch). I checked the Internet and found a few reports of people having their Health data disappear on them after the 10.1 update on the Apple discussion boards and in online media: see here and here. Those reports suggested that nothing appeared to fix the problem — not restarting, not restoring from backup or factory settings, not even downgrading back to 10.0.3. They also suggested that the data was simply inaccessible rather than missing.  A check of Settings revealed that I still have (as of this writing) 88.5 megabytes of Health data; I just can’t get at it. And adding new data doesn’t do anything: it doesn’t appear either. So I called AppleCare, which began as an exercise in frustration. Getting past the first level of support required me to breathe fire a bit, and I got disconnected when being transferred, but in the end I got through to a senior advisor and was able to have a productive conversation about it. Apple is just starting to get reports on this, so not everyone has encountered customer complaints about it or knows about it — keep this in mind if you have to call AppleCare yourself. From what I can tell Apple’s engineers are still trying to get a handle on the issue. I was given a number of questions to answer that I presume are so that they can replicate the issue, and I’ve been following up with additional observations (which by the way is really quite extraordinary: it takes out a bit of the sting of having been hit by this bug to be able to help in fixing it) so I suspect they’re at the early stages of “Apple is aware of the situation and is working on a solution.” I hope that this will turn out to be an easy fix and that it’ll be pushed out quickly. (Apple has every motivation to get this done fast: Health and Activity are rather important features that form a major part of the rationale for the Apple Watch.) The fact that the data still appears to be there, and that Activity sharing is still taking place between my and Jennifer’s Watches, makes me think that it’s a problem with the user-facing apps accessing the data rather than the data itself. When you go into Sources in the Health app and choose one of the data sources (for example, your iPhone or your Watch), I get an endlessly spinning wheel; on Jennifer’s iPhone SE, which is still running iOS 10.0.3, the categories of data the devices contribute to (such as heart rate, walking activity) show up in a second or two. Does this mean you should hold off upgrading to 10.1 if you haven’t already done so? That’s a really tough call: 10.1 fixes some major security flaws that really ought not to be left unfixed. It’s not clear how widespread the Health and Activity problem is: whether it’s affecting only a few people or whether it’s hitting everyone who uses the apps — we’ll know more in the coming days. At this point, if you have an Apple Watch or use the Health app a lot, I can totally understand not wanting to upgrade quite yet.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Real World Technologies dissects Apple's A10 GPU by Wayne Manion  11:42 AM on October 31, 2016 David Kanter over at Real World Technologies has released his ruminations on the GPU portion of Apple's latest A10 SoCs. Apple has licensed Imagination Technologies' PowerVR graphics IP since the earliest days of the iPhone and iPad. However, after comparing developer documentation from both Apple and Imagination Technologies, Kanter concluded that Apple has been slowly replacing off-the-shelf components of PowerVR GPUs with its own proprietary designs. He argues those components have been appearing in Apple SoCs since the A8 chip that powers the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. Roughly speaking, Kanter describes a GPU as having three parts: fixed-function hardware, shader cores, and a software driver. The fixed-function hardware manages API commands and rasterization. The shader cores perform programmable graphics computation, and the driver translates API calls into commands for both the fixed-function hardware and the shaders. According to Kanter's research, the GPUs in Apple's A8 and newer SoCs employ still employ Imagination's fixed-function graphics hardware, but the shader cores and driver are unique to Apple. Kanter speculates that a portion of Apple's GPU improvements in performance and power efficiency stem from the use of smaller half-precision floating-point registers. Half-precision is considered "good enough" for graphics, image processing, and machine learning. Kanter says that Apple's GPUs provide free conversion between different data types, enabling compilers and encouraging programmers to use "minimum data" when possible, rather than worrying about the computational cost of data type conversion. Apple claims the "Portrait mode" feature on the iPhone 7 Plus uses machine learning to work its magic. Even if machine learning isn't involved, the faux-bokeh effects certainly involves the graphics and image processing points of the reduced-precision-math triangle. Kanter told us that many of Instagram's filters execute on the GPU for efficiency and performance reasons, too. Kanter goes on to speculate about how Apple might benefit from exclusive GPU designs in their iOS devices. In-house GPU design might allows Apple to retain the benefits of research and develpment, rather than technology filtering back to competitors through Imagination Technologies. The article is a great read, and we are just skimming the surface. Go check it out here.

Microsoft and Apple are cases in point, because Apple was very successful under the initial founders, then was unsuccessful after the founders left, was successful again when Jobs came back, and now is struggling without him. Microsoft was very successful under Gates, struggled when Gates left, and is successful again now that it is run by someone very much like Gates. The core magic is this: having someone who is running the company who both understands the technology and understands either the customer's current needs -- or how to manipulate customers to need what you make. I'll focus on that this time and close with my product of the week, which has to be the amazing Microsoft Surface Studio, which is arguably what Apple should have shipped. Steve Jobs Was Unique I get why Apple struggled to find a replacement for Steve Jobs -- not only after he died, but also earlier, after he initially was fired. The guy was unique. After reading a number of books on his life and on his presentation and product secrets, it became clear to me that what made him different was that he both understood technology well enough to direct his firm and understood people well enough to convince us that what we wanted was what he built. He was absolutely correct in believing that it was stupid to use focus groups as a planning exercise. He understood that people don't know what they want, and that the successful company is the one that can manipulate them into wanting what it builds. He became CEO of the decade and built the most financially successful firm in the current age -- yet there isn't another firm in the market that even comes close to emulating his model. Now the reason we don't see this model emulated is that if Steve Jobs were to apply for a job at any tech company today with the resume he had at Apple's beginning, he would not be hired. I think you could say the same of Bill Gates, which really points to what I think is a fundamental problem with the current hiring process. People who might rise to run a firm like Jobs ran Apple and Gates ran Microsoft can get to the CEO position only if they form their own firms, and right now getting VC money without a degree would be nearly as impossible as getting hired would be. What I don't get is why firms don't have a process specifically designed to bring in passionate creative types who have high IQs but who didn't do well in schools -- or why schools that specialize in creating CEO types, like Harvard, don't find a better way to find and certify them. From Jobs vs. Ballmer to Nadella vs. Cook What also is fascinating is that after Apple's board saw how Jobs stepped all over Steve Ballmer at Microsoft, it went ahead and replaced Jobs with someone more like Ballmer. Cook and Ballmer are both good managers. They're great with numbers, they're hard workers, and they both love their firms. However, neither has a creative bone in their bodies. They aren't even remotely charismatic, and the only customers they readily identify with are corporate customers, which is particularly problematic for Apple, which doesn't really serve that customer base. In effect, Nadella is very similar to Gates, and Cook is very similar to Ballmer -- granted, without the famous temper -- and the end result is that Apple has dropped into decline and Microsoft is surging again, albeit with Azure and Web services, which luckily is where the excitement is. Warring Announcements It was fascinating to watch the Microsoft and Apple hardware launches last week. The Microsoft launch was focused tightly on creators, Apple's historic core base, while the Apple launch didn't seem to focus on users at all. Apple presented a collection of features that don't seem to be sourced in any clear customer need. For instance, I've never seen customers ask for a flexible secondary touch screen, particularly when the product lacks a primary touch screen. Also ironic is the fact that folks leaving the Microsoft event lusted after both the new Surface Book and, particularly, the Surface Studio, while those at the Apple event seemed disappointed they'd have to settle. If I were to go back a decade, the exact opposite would have been true. We'd all have wanted what Jobs presented and wondered if Ballmer missed a meeting. What makes me sad is that we never got to see what would have happened in a Jobs vs. Nadella matchup, because that would have been amazing. I expect that both men would have driven their opponent to ever higher levels of performance. Wrapping Up: Lessons Learned There are several things I take away from this. One is that you need a CEO who has a number of key core skills to be successful. A CEO needs to be knowledgeable enough about the products the company builds to manage the process, as well as connected to the folks who buy the products. The CEO needs to be able to make intelligent choices with regard to product direction, to be able to pitch the offerings effectively, and to be charismatic enough to develop a following. The CEO must be willing to take large measured risks in order to bring out compelling new products that their competitors have to chase, rather than copying what is out there -- which, sadly, is more the norm. We need a better way to get folks like Jobs into companies and to fast-track them into becoming CEOs. Otherwise, it may be a really long time before we again have a firm that stands out like Apple once did. Generally, folks like Jobs choose to go into politics, religion or crime... . Something to think about this week. Every once in a while, a firm creates a product that I lust for at first sight. That "once in a while" happened last week at the launch of the Microsoft Surface Studio. The product is designed for creators, and it made me wish I'd followed in the footsteps of my mother, who was a graphics artist. Sadly, I couldn't draw to save my life -- but if I did, having a tool like this would be amazing. What's amazing are the industrial design and image quality. Had I not known better, I would have thought the image on the screen was a taped-on high resolution picture and not a display. Even an inch away, I couldn't see the pixels. Had someone told me it was an OLED screen and not an LCD screen, I likely would have believed it -- the colors were that deep. Microsoft Surface Studio It uses a Bluetooth wheel that can be placed on the screen to reconfigure its functions automatically -- from selecting colors and brushes to controlling volume and screen brightness. I've used wheels like this before, and they are incredibly handy if you are willing to spend the time it takes to learn their functions. It has only one critical cord in the back, giving you a very clean desktop. The industrial design places most of the electronics in the base, making the result far more stable and far more useful than an iMac. This really is the product Apple should have announced last week. At just a tad under US$3,000 the Surface Studio isn't a cheap date, but for those who need a tool like this, it is well worth the money. When placed side by side, it makes a now badly aging iMac look so last century. The Surface Studio is really for a small set of special people: creators, executives, and anyone who wants to fill their Apple friends with embarrassing envy. That last point alone makes it worth the price of admission, so the Microsoft Surface Studio is an ideal choice for my product of the week.

Apple and the New Kid in Town. How Google Pixel Will Change the iPhone GO Did the iPhone find its match? Will the Google Pixel challenge the iPhone to become something much better? Oct 31, 2016 17:32 GMT  ·  By Adrian Boioglu  ·  Share:  Slow update cycles, malware, OS not optimized to the hardware and bloatware. These are the main complaints when it comes to Android smartphones. You can blame Google, the carriers or the hardware manufacturers, but you can never find a solution for all of the problems.  Until now. Google Pixel is the iPhone equivalent of the Android ecosystem: one phone to rule them all, made by Google and running the latest and greatest Android version. There are quite a few ways the Google Pixel will push Apple and the iPhone forward, and we are here to discuss all of them. Hardware copycats Hardware-wise there is nothing much to say, besides the fact that Google copied the iPhone in great details. We've got two phones with the same screen sizes as the iPhone, the same antenna lines on the back, and a TouchID button awkwardly moved to the back of the device. Even the chin of the Google Pixel looks like they were left with some space below the software buttons and there was no way to hide it or skip it. This is not something new. Samsung, HTC and other manufacturers have copied Apple products years in a row. The fact that Google did not invest in R&D and product design may prove to be an issue in the future. Both if Apple decides to sue them for stealing the design of the iPhone 6 and because the fruit-named company will move on to a new design and Google's will seem old and unfashionable. Google Photos versus iCloud Google is one step ahead of Apple when it comes to cloud storage. And the fact that it offers free unlimited storage for photos and videos (even high-resolution photos and 4K videos) gives it the upper hand in this battle. There is one catch, though: that unlimited space on Google Photos is only good for photos and videos, unlike iCloud Drive which can store documents, app data and other kinds of files. Also, only files created / taken on Google Pixel can be uploaded. Even so, Google Photos is an awesome addition to the Pixel. Shortage of cloud storage is a big problem these days and there is no way you can compare "Unlimited" with 32GB of the cheapest iPhone + the 5GB of storage given away for free by Apple with the basic iCloud account. I don't even want to remember the fact that the same iCloud account is split between an iPhone, an iPad and a Mac for most users and those 5GB prove to be far from enough for the basic back-up needs of a regular Apple user. Sure enough, Apple can improve in that field. Giving away 5GB for every device connected to an iCloud account is the first step. There were users who requested Apple to match the capacity of the device with the free tier of the cloud storage. For example, if you buy a 32GB iPhone, you also get 32GB of iCloud storage for free. Got a 128GB iPhone? Get the same space on iCloud. This is not something feasible for Apple, as MacBook Pros come in 2TB drives nowadays. Will this change the way Apple works? If the Pixel sales are good, Apple may consider changing the iCloud policies and offer more for the same price. Opening iOS to other devices or restricting Android to the Pixel How would you feel if Android were restricted to the Pixel or whatever the Google flagship phone is called? No competitors by Samsung, HTC, Huawei, or others. Fortunately, this will not happen anytime soon, because Google is not only in the business of selling the Operating System, but they want to be everywhere to gather data and display ads. Google will always have a larger user base for Android. Their problem would be to push the manufacturers, carriers and users to be on the last OS version. And that can prove impossible with cheap hardware coming from low-end manufacturers. Will this change the way Apple works? We know for sure that there will not be iOS on non-Apple hardware, but their apps may find a way to work on Android. And I am talking especially about iMessage and FaceTime. Apple Stores and the promise of "privacy" Google has two downsides when it comes to promoting its products. Apple has Stores and everyone can play with an iPhone before they buy it. Trying to decide between the Black and the Jet Black finish can be a challenge for some users, and doing that in the Apple Store makes a world of difference. Google relies on carriers' stores to promote the Pixel and we all know how motivated the employees can be when it comes to a phone. The pixel is only available in the United States and can be purchased only in Verizon Stores and Best Buy. Will Apple take advantage of that? Well, they already do that now. There is one other aspect of this story worth mentioning, the one related to the privacy, and I left this one at the end for a reason. Google has to convince users they will not collect information in order to use it for Ads and other nefarious purposes. Apple has taken the "privacy" route a couple of years ago and they are already running with it. Having a personal assistant (Siri) do all its computations on the device makes a big difference in the eyes of a user. Even the fact that Google Photos will scan all your pictures in order to provide fast and accurate search results, versus the way Apple does that on the device itself, can be a setback for the user. Will Apple benefit from that? Oh, you can bet they will! #Google Pixel#iPhone#Android#Google Photos#iCloud subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Apple's Real Courage Explain That, Apple!

To commemorate the release of the iPhone 7, here are seven times when Apple fans let their passion for the gadgets get the better of them. Thrifty young Ukrainian changes name for latest iPhone Last week a young Ukrainian changed his name to iPhone Sim (meaning iPhone 7 in Ukrainian), after an electronics store offered a free handset to the first five people to do so. iPhone Sim shows his new passport in this Facebook post by another user. It cost iPhone Sim just $2 to change his name, far less than the iPhone 7, which retails at more than $850 in Ukraine. 20 iPhones from 20 boyfriends enable crafty Chinese woman to buy a house Last week the Chinese media reported a cunning plan executed by a woman from the southern Chinese city of Shenzen, who asked 20 boyfriends to buy her the newly released iPhone 7.  The boyfriends obliged, and the women then sold the iPhones on Hui Shou Bao, a mobile phone recycling site. She received 120,000 Chinese yuan (about £14,500) from the sale, with which she put down a deposit on a house in the countryside. © REUTERS/ Issei Kato Apple's new iPhone 7 Plus is displayed at the Apple Store at Tokyo's Omotesando shopping district, Japan, September 16, 2016Thai fan flies ten hours & queues 18 to get first spot at Apple store in Sydney Last month Attapon Thaphaengphan flew from the Thai capital Bangkok to Australia, the first country where the new iPhone 7 went on sale, on Friday 16 September. He spent 18 hours queueing outside the Apple store in Sydney, in order to be one of the first to get his hands on an iPhone. However, Thaphaengphan found time to enjoy the city, too. Before making his way to the Apple store, he met with friends and did some sightseeing in Sydney, and documented his trip on Facebook. German schoolboy drains a whole pond to get the iPhone he dropped In July 2014 a school fishing trip turned into the stuff of nightmares for a 16-year-old in Germany, when his iPhone slipped out of his hand into the pond. When the anglers supervising the trip refused to allow him to dive into the pond to get the phone, the boy secretly returned some hours later, armed with pumps and two hoses. "I knew the phone was probably dead but wanted to get the data card back with the numbers, pictures and videos of my friends," the boy told a local paper in Cologne, Germany. Weil sein Handy reingefallen ist: 16-Jähriger pumpt Anglerteich ins Klo. http://t.co/mNHVdGVZgZ pic.twitter.com/kTJnRWsYTR — BILD Digital (@BILD_Digital) 30 июля 2014 г. ​"I thought two pumps would drain enough of the water from the pond so I could find my cellphone." Unfortunately, the toilet of the angling club into which the boy intended to drain the water was not connected to the sewage system, and he instead succeeded only in flooding the nearby parking lot. The owner of the parking lot called the police, who dashed his hopes of retrieving the phone. The schoolboy, who had to pay for damage to the toilet, the parking lot, and the pond, was nevertheless unrepentant, insisting, "It almost worked." Saudi man asks for iPhone dowry for his sister In September 2014 a man in Saudi Arabia reportedly asked for an iPhone 6 in return for his sister's hand in marriage. "The brother's condition supplants the father's request for a simple amount of money as the dowry for the marriage," reported the Kuwaiti daily Al Anba. The brother asked for the phone from his sister's fiancée when it was still unavailable locally, and said the marriage couldn't go ahead until he had received the phone, which went on sale in Saudi Arabia on September 26 last year. Couple in China sell their newborn daughter to pay for an iPhone A couple from Shanghai were arrested after they sold their baby daughter, and spent the proceeds on an iPhone, as well as expensive trainers and other luxury items.   Before the baby's birth the parents placed advertisements seeking between 30,000 yuan (4,700 USD) and 50,000 yuan (7,850 USD), for their daughter. They covered up the pregnancy from friends and relatives, and after a home birth they handed the child over to her purchaser. "We did not give the child away to obtain profit, but to give the child better guarantees," the couple, who are both unemployed and already had two children, protested during their trial in October 2013. © REUTERS/ Thomas Peter Members of the media film the new iPhone 7 at an Apple store in Beijing, China, September 16, 2016Chinese schoolboy sells his kidney and buys iPhone  "I wanted to buy an iPad 2, but I didn't have the money," the 17-year-old boy told Shenzhen TV in China's southern province of Guangdong, which reported the story in 2011. "When I surfed the internet, I found an advert posted online by an agent saying they were able to pay 20,000 yuan (3,140 USD) to buy a kidney."  Without his parents' knowledge, the teenager traveled from his home in Anhui Province to the city of Chenzhou in Hunan Province, where a surgeon at a local hospital removed the organ, after which the boy received 22,000 yuan. He spent the money on the Apple device, and reportedly also bought a laptop as well. "When he came back, he had a laptop and a new Apple handset," said his mother, who showed the TV station the scar where her son's kidney was removed. "I wanted to know how he had got so much money and he finally confessed that he had sold one of his kidneys." In November 2012 five people were jailed for their role in the illegal organ transplant, including the surgeon, who received a three year prison sentence with a reprieve of five years. The boy reportedly suffered renal deficiency after the operation, and received compensation of 1.47 million yuan ($231,000) from the defendants.  ...

Last month, we saw a bird’s eye overview of the enormous ring-shaped building facade glowing at night and the month before landscaping work was beginning to show. Their latest footage reveals major landscape changes with large trees sprouting up everywhere around the new campus. The installation of solar panels has been about fifty percent completed, according to the YouTubers. You can also see some major progress being made to the garden, pond and outdoor dining areas inside of the iSpaceship building. Don’t forget to manually enable 4K resolution via YouTube controls because these gorgeous flyover videos looks so much better in four times the pixel density of 1080p. Duncan’s video reveals that the Cupertino City Council have permitted Apple to renovate certain parts of the apartment complex called The Hamptons to create nearly three times as many units in the area. When finished, Apple Campus 2 will be one of the largest office buildings in the world. Apple’s been working on the iSpaceship building, Apple’s second Cupertino campus, for two years now. The project had a tentative moving-in date of January 2017, but the recently-updated general construction schedule on the City of Cupertino website suggests Apple may have pushed back its estimated end date for building construction by three months. Specifically, the new schedule calls for the start of landscaping work to extend into the second quarter of 2017, meaning employees could move in while landscape around the site is being finished. An expected end date for completing construction and street utility has now been extended until early-2017. Mid-October marked 36 months since crews began work at the 176 acre site. As mentioned, construction is set to wrap up in the next six months or less. Did iSpaceship impress you much?

By Todd Haselton | October 31, 2016 Share Stay Connected with Us! Follow TechnoBuffalo Apple released iOS 10.1.1 this morning. It seems to be relatively minor, but you’ll probably want to install it just to be on the safe side. According to Apple, iOS 10.1.1 “fixes bugs including an issue where Health data could not be viewed for some users.” That could be a big deal, depending on how much you use Health. iOS 10.1.1 fixes Health If you’re like me, for example, and open it once every few months just to see how far you walked on a given day, then it’s not a big deal.

Apple has reportedly killed its iconic MacBook startup sound. The F-sharp major chord, used for all Mac computers since 1999, no longer signifies a successful bootup. As first reported by Pingie, the traditional chime has been removed completely as Apple's new MacBook Pros turn on automatically when the lid is lifted or the computer is plugged in. Tech-savvy Mac fans can re-enable it, however, according to Pingie. Over the years, the sound has made its way into popular culture; it was featured in Pixar's 2008 film WALL-E, among other things. Apple did not immediately respond to PCMag's request for comment. The tech titan last week announced the first MacBook Pro update since 2015: New models come in 13- and 15-inch sizes, available in silver or space gray, with a larger Force Touch trackpad and updated keyboard. Most notable is the new "Touch Bar"—a long, thin Retina display with multi-touch capabilities that allows users to set system preferences and interact with apps. //Related Articles MacBook Pro 2016: Should You Upgrade? The 15-inch model starts at $2,399 for a 2.6GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 processor with Turbo Boost speeds up to 3.5GHz, Radeon Pro 450 graphics, 16GB of memory, and 256GB of flash storage. Bump that to a 2.7GHz chip, 3.6GHz Turbo Boost, and 512GB of storage for $2,799. Its smaller, 13-inch sibling starts at $1,799 for a 2.9GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor with Turbo Boost speeds up to 3.3GHz, 8GB of memory, 256GB of flash storage, and Intel Iris Graphics 550.

Stephen Lam / Getty A version of this essay was originally published at Tech.pinions, a website dedicated to informed opinions, insight and perspective on the tech industry. Apple introduced new MacBook Pros last week, and in addition to bright new screens, fast new processors and — of course — ever-thinner form factors, Apple introduced a new hardware feature called the Touch Bar. It’s a high-quality miniature screen that runs the length of the keyboard, replacing the old F-keys row above the numeric keys. In person, this display looks great, and it has a unique coating that makes using it feel super smooth. As you might expect, Apple’s Mac OS and first-party apps use Touch Bar right away, but if it is going to become a must-have feature worthy of driving Mac buyers to upgrade, third-party developers will also have to embrace it. At launch, Apple already had buy-in from big firms such as Microsoft and Adobe. But the real question is whether the rest of the developer community will follow suit, and if so, how soon? Sticking to its guns I’ve lamented before that, after using a number of touch-enabled Windows notebooks, using a non-touch Mac notebook felt like a step backward. It’s easy to see Apple’s decision to put a small touchscreen above the keyboard as a simple, stubborn unwillingness to bend to the larger trends in the PC industry, just as it once resisted larger smartphone screens. To its credit, with the Touch Bar, Apple has put together a touch technology that its executives clearly believe is a better option than a touchscreen. Apple has long suggested that reaching up to touch the screen of a Mac is unnatural, and that it breaks the usage model of the notebook. In theory, I agree that touching a notebook screen seems unnatural. But I also know, now that I’ve been doing it for a while, that it feels pretty natural to me to reach up to touch the screen to scroll a web page. Apple has put together a touch technology that its executives clearly believe is a better option than a touchscreen. Keeping the Touch Bar on the horizontal axis means, as a user, that I’m not reaching for the screen. But it also means I’m looking down from the screen toward the keys to find the specific custom keys that each application serves up on the Touch Bar. I suppose that over time you could develop some muscle memory for the unique Touch Bar keys you use often, but that seems unlikely. After the Apple keynote on Thursday, I participated in a deep-dive session, and had the chance to spend some time with the new hardware. I can tell you this much: The Touch Bar is addictively enjoyable to use. It works as you would expect for tasks such as scrolling through pictures and video (fast and fun), changing system settings (precise as physical buttons) and using the calculator (it’s the killer app — seriously, you heard it here first). But where the Touch Bar really shows promise is with large, complicated apps such as Microsoft Word and Excel, and Adobe Photoshop. These apps tend to have tons of features that get lost in icon-dense ribbons or buried deep in drop-down menus. With Touch Bar, the developer can surface some of these features, making them visible and more easily accessible for the average user. Power users might scoff, but for many people this level of increased visibility could lead to real productivity gains. Apple tells me that it is very easy for a developer to enable the Touch Bar for their apps, and noted that partners appearing onstage this week did so in a very short amount of time. It will be interesting to see if other major Mac software developers do the same in the coming weeks. And it will be perhaps more telling if smaller developers, with more constrained development time and budgets, decide such an update is worthwhile for their users. Touch ID Impact or 3D Touch Impact? What’s not clear to me yet is whether the Touch Bar is one of those new features that will instantly resonate with customers and become a part of their daily lives or if it is merely an interesting technology that makes for a great demo but never really takes off in common use. A good example of the first was Apple’s introduction of Touch ID on the iPhone (and available now on the MacBook Pros with Touch Bar). That technology fundamentally changed the way the vast majority of iPhone users interact with their phone every single time they pick it up. An example of the latter is 3D Touch, an interesting technology that I often forget is on my phone unless I accidentally trigger it. 3D Touch may eventually become an integral part of the iPhone interface, but right now it doesn’t feel like most people see it that way. It’s too soon to tell which way the Touch Bar will go. One thing is clear: Apple sees it as a feature some customers will pay to have, as the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar carries a roughly $300 premium over a comparable model without it. (Note: The Touch Bar model also has a better CPU.) After a brief hands-on, the Touch Bar feels to me like an important refinement to a tried-and-true interface. I’m not sure yet if it’s better or worse than a touchscreen, but I look forward to testing the hardware in the coming weeks to see how it impacts my usage. And I’ll be watching closely to see which developers embrace the technology and which do not. Tom Mainelli has covered the technology industry since 1995.

"We don't know whether Apple's OLED iPhones will be a hit, but if Apple doesn't walk down this path and transform itself, there will be no innovation. It is a crisis but it is also an opportunity," he said. Jeng-wu also said that Apple is considering manufacturing some of the OLED panels in the US, adding that Sharp would set up a factory in the country if required.LG V20 with Android 7.0 Nougat set to launch in India at Rs. 49,990 The first smartphone with Android 7.0 Nougat out of the box, LG V20 is close to its India launch, though the launch date is not yet confirmed. However, Gadgets 360 has learnt that the smartphone will bear a price tag of Rs. 49,990 when it arrives on Indian shores. LG's flagship smartphone features a 5.7-inch IPS Quantum Display as the primary screen, along with a secondary touchscreen panel to view notifications and alerts.

Half of Samsung Galaxy Note 7 users moved to iPhone? In an IDC survey of over a thousand US smartphone buyers, which had 24 Samsung Galaxy Note 7 users, it was found that the company's brand value did not suffer much from the phablet exploding. However, over half of the Galaxy Note 7 users in the survey said that they had switched to an iPhone after the recall; 17 percent of these users said that they would opt for another Samsung device. Facebook testing Snapchat-like camera effects and masks After Instagram and Messenger, it is the turn of the Facebook app to get a taste of Snapchat-like features. The social networking company is testing photo effects and masks in its main camera app for stills and videos that disappear after 24 hours. The new features include Snapchat-style animated selfie masks, overlaid graphics, and geofilters, Prisma-esque fine art-themed style transfer filters and some innovative new reactive filters that respond to your body's movements. Apple quietly raises MacBook price in India While all eyes were glued to the new 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro 2016 models, Apple quietly increased the price of the 12-inch MacBook by up to Rs. 10,000 in India.

Jim Cramer Oct 31, 2016 11:42 AM EDT It's highly unlikely that Apple (AAPL) will try and top AT&T's (T) bid for Time Warner (TWX) , says TheStreet's Jim Cramer. Last week AT&T said it will buy Time Warner in an ambitious $85.4 billion deal that would create a powerhouse in global telecommunications, television and film. The agreement was approved by the boards of both AT&T and Time Warner. The deal, which would be half in cash and half in stock, values Time Warner at $107.50 a share, a 20% premium to its $89.48 closing price on Friday. Time Warner shareholders will receive $53.75 a share in cash and $53.75 a share in AT&T stock. The total transaction value is $108.7 billion after including Time Warner's net debt. The merger, which will need regulatory approval, would combine AT&T's extensive broadband and wireless operations in North and South America with Time Warner's HBO, its cable-TV networks TBS, TNT and CNN, as well as the Warner Brothers film studio.

Evan Niu (TMFNewCow) Oct 31, 2016 at 11:00AM CEO Tim Cook introducing new Macs at the October event. Image source: Apple. I'm on record as being a huge fan of Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) capital return program. Not only is the program highly accretive to earnings due to its sheer size, but it also improves certain performance metrics such as return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE) by reducing the denominators in those equations. Prior to the program's implementation, Apple truly had accumulated far too much cash on the balance sheet that was doing absolutely nothing, and CEO Tim Cook finally addressed long-standing criticisms around capital efficiency by starting to give it back to shareholders. But at the same time, you also don't want to give too much back. Apple has found the right balance on how much capital to return. How much is too much? Free cash flow is already an important metric for investors to watch, particularly any company that has meaningful manufacturing operations. Even if the labor is outsourced to contract manufacturers, like it is in Apple's case, the company still has to spend heavily on infrastructure and tooling equipment. To determine the cash that Apple pays for capital expenditures, you add up two line items on the cash flow statement: payments for property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) and payments for intangible assets. Once you subtract this total from operating cash flow, you get free cash flow. Data source: SEC filings. Fiscal years shown. Chart by author. In the context of capital returns, dividends and share repurchases inevitably come out of free cash flow, and free cash flow is necessary to support ongoing investments needed to sustain the business. This why it's useful to compare capital returns to free cash flow. Data source: SEC filings. Fiscal years shown. Chart by author. It should be intuitively obvious that returning greater than 100% of free cash flow is unsustainable in the long run (Apple actually did this in fiscal 2014, returning 112% of free cash flow). The good news is that in the two fiscal years since, Apple has brought this percentage down to a more sustainable level. Apple returned 67% of free cash flow in fiscal 2015, and 80% of free cash flow in fiscal 2016. A comfortable level is anywhere in the 70% to 80% range. Of course, these are based on consolidated financial results, and Apple funds the majority of its capital return program with debt issuances that aren't tied directly to operating cash flow or free cash flow. So it's worth acknowledging that the company's capital return program is also a function of its ability to continue raising debt (Apple now has nearly $80 billion in long-term debt), unless there's a tax repatriation holiday that allows some of that money mountain to come back to the U.S. What to expect when you're expecting a capital return update next April This also helps investors know what to expect in April, when Apple gives its annual update to its capital return program. For instance, here's how Apple has boosted its share repurchase authorization since 2013. Year Increase in Buyback Authorization 2013 $50 billion 2014 $30 billion 2015 $50 billion 2016 $35 billion Data source: SEC filings. Since operating cash flow, and thus free cash flow, declined in fiscal 2016 and is unlikely to unexpectedly soar in fiscal 2017, I wouldn't expect another massive increase in the share repurchase authorization this coming April. As of right now, Apple has approximately $40 billion remaining on the current authorization, and has been buying back an average of $7.4 billion of shares per quarter over the past year. So by the time April rolls around, Apple should still have a decent amount of authorization remaining, so I would expect it to lean toward the conservative side of its historical increases.

TrustedReviews Facebook Twitter Googleplus TVs & Audio Cameras Computing Mobile Home appliances Gaming Competitions GPS & Sat Nav Mobile Apps Mobile Phone Accessories Mobile Phones Tablets Wearables & Fitness Trending: iOS 10 Apple Watch 2 iPhone 7 Galaxy S7 vs iPhone 6S Google Pixel Galaxy S7 Home / News / Mobile Phone News / Report – Foxconn testing wireless charging for iPhone 8 Report – Foxconn testing wireless charging for iPhone 8 by Joe Roberts 31 October 2016 0 shares Read Comments Despite the fact the iPhone 8 is almost a year away, the rumours have been stacking up lately, with suggestions of OLED tech and edge-to-edge screens doing the rounds. The latest report, from Nikkei Asian Review, claims that Foxconn, one of the firms responsible for assembling iPhones, is testing wireless charging modules for the iPhone 8. Citing 'an industry source familiar with the matter', the report states the wireless charging feature could appear on the next Apple handset, but it depends whether the company can produce enough satisfactory units. Related: iPhone 8 – Everything we know The source told Nikkei: "Whether the feature can eventually make it into Apple's updated devices will depend on whether Foxconn can boost the yield rate to a satisfactory level later on." The yield rate refers to the 'number of satisfactory units in the production of a batch of components', and if it's found to be too low, the wireless charging feature could be left out of the iPhone 8 according to the report. It's also claimed the wireless tech could make it into some versions of the iPhone 8 and not others. The iPhone 7 came with minimal design changes in comparison to the iPhone 6S The latest rumour follows an earlier report from the same outlet which quotes Sharp President Tai Jeng-wu as saying: "The iPhone has been evolving and now it is switching from LTPS (low-temperature poly-silicon) to OLED panels." Other recent rumours claim Apple will release 4.7-inch and 5-inch iPhone 8 models, alongside a premium 5.5-inch version of the handset which is said to be the OLED version of the phone. Related: iPhone 7 review It could very well be, if this is accurate, that the wireless charging tech comes with the premium 5.5-inch iPhone 8. At this point, then, it's unclear just what Apple has in-store, but the company will be looking to shake things up with its next handset. The iPhone 7, though it's proved to be a popular handset, introduced minimal design changes, and doesn't look like it will do much to alleviate Apple's revenue problems. The firm announced a year-on-year fall in revenue for the first time since 2003 at the end of last quarter, which analysts have put down to an over-saturated smartphone market. As such, we're expecting a lot from Apple when it comes to the iPhone 8, but at this early stage, it's advisable to take all reports and rumours with a pinch of salt.

Apple officially reported 9.26 million iPads sold in the quarter, representing late June to late September, but it does not break down its tablet sales by individual model. IDC did not share its methodology behind calculating iPad Pro sales specifically, but vaguely notes that it uses proprietary tools and research processes. Despite selling some 600,000 fewer iPads compared to the year-ago quarter, Apple's tablet revenue remained flat at just over $4.2 billion in the quarter. The reason: iPad Pros cost more. The higher ASP is important for Apple as the worldwide tablet market continued its slump last quarter. IDC estimates tablet shipments dropped to an estimated 43 million units in the quarter, marking a 14.7% year-over-year decline. Apple led all vendors with 21.5% market share, up slightly from 19.6% in the year-ago quarter, while Samsung trailed in second with an estimated 6.5 million shipments and 15.1% market share. Amazon and Chinese competitors Lenovo and Huawei rounded off the top five with an estimated 3.1 million, 2.7 million, and 2.4 million tablet shipments respectively in the quarter. Amazon saw explosive 319.9% growth due to its Amazon Prime Day sale in early July that led to a huge surge in shipments of its Fire tablets. During its recent earnings call, Apple financial chief Luca Maestri said the company is "highly successful" in the tablet market, with 82% market share of premium tablets priced above $200. Meanwhile, IDC said other vendors are "racing to the bottom" with low-cost, sub-$200 traditional and detachable 2-in-1 tablets. "The race to the bottom is something we have already experienced with slates and it may prove detrimental to the market in the long run as detachables could easily be seen as disposable devices rather than potential PC replacements," said Jitesh Ubrani, senior research analyst with IDC.

Think about all the iPads sold to be used as cash registers. Not at all surprising that most of the iPad buyers didn't opt for the Pro. Guess what? The Porsche 918 made up less than 1% of Porsche's sales last year.

Zero lag regardless of how fast you move the stylus or what type of drawing media the app is simulating. Pixelmator never seems to slow down regardless of how many layers you have in high-resolution.

They are so good at showing why you need it, then ignore. If they were serious about a Pro Tablet, they should have written a Pro iOS to go with it. When iOS 10 beta came out and there were almost zero iPad specific features, I feared the worst and it looks like I am right.

Rumours back in March suggested Apple would install one in the iPhone 7S after Apple supposedly inked a deal with LG and Samsung for the mass production of OLED screens. iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus: What's the story so far? Now though, it's Sharp's CEO that has pretty much confirmed the iPhone 8 - or iPhone Pro- due for release in September next year to commemorate 10 years of the iPhone, will feature an OLED screen. Sharp CEO Jeng-wu Tai was speaking at Tatung University in Taiwan over the weekend and said "The iPhone has been evolving and now it is switching from LTPS to OLED panels". "We don't know whether Apple's OLED iPhones will be a hit, but if Apple doesn't walk down this path and transform itself, there will be no innovation. It is a crisis but it is also an opportunity". If that isn't enough confirmation then we don't know what is. Tai is also an executive at Foxconn, Sharp's parent company and manufacturer of the iPhone, so we'd say he's in a good position to know what's happening with future models. Chinese site Nikkei also reports that Apple will release three iPhones in 2017, two that will still use LTPS panels and an iPhone Pro that will get an OLED panel instead. However, Nikkei was also the source of the rumour that Apple was close to signing a deal with LG and Samsung, which hasn't happened, so we'd take the possibility of three iPhones with a pinch of salt for now. It wouldn't be too farfetched to assume that Apple will use an OLED panel though, as the company already uses them in the Watch. However that's because it's easier to manufacture smaller OLED panels for the watch screen, as opposed to 4.7- to 5.5-inch screens for the iPhone. Apple is expected to unveil the new iPhone in September next year as part of its yearly cycle. Considering it will be the tenth anniversary of the ubiquitous smartphone, we wouldn't be surprised if Apple wanted to radically change the design or components.

This cool concept is the best you’ll get for now Want to see Apple’s iPhone 8? This cool concept is the best you’ll get for now by Sean Keach 31 October 2016 0 shares Read Comments The world is expecting major changes from Apple’s iPhone 8 next year – is this an early glimpse of what to expect? A digital artist has created a video concept of the iPhone 8, based on all of the rumours and leaks we’ve seen so far. Veniamin Geskin, of Riga, Latvia, uploaded the video to YouTube last month, showcasing a handset with an all-glass front, a curved display, and no Home button. Check it out: He also posted a few more renders to Twitter, off the back of rumours that Apple would introduce a new 5-inch iPhone variant next year, to sit in between the existing 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch models: Unlike this year’s tepidly received iPhone 7, the iPhone 8 is expected to be a major shake-up of Apple’s flagship smartphone design. Prominent Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, of KGI Securities, expects Apple to introduce a new ‘all-glass’ design with the iPhone 8, as well as removing the Home button. And earlier today, we reported on comments from Tai Jeng-wu, President at Sharp, who revealed that Apple would be switching to OLED displays with the next handset, as rumoured. Speaking at Tatung University (via Nikkei Asian Review), Tai said: “The iPhone has been evolving and now it is switching from LTPS (low-temperature poly-silicon) to OLED panels. We don’t know whether Apple’s OLED iPhones will be a hit, but if Apple doesn’t walk down this path and transform itself, there will be no innovation. It is a crisis but it is also an opportunity.” It’s long been expected that Apple would eventually follow Samsung’s suit and switch to OLED panels for the iPhone. Unlike conventional LED-backlit screens, each pixel in an OLED display produces its own light, which means there’s no need for a backlight – that saves energy. And as individual pixels can be turned off to represent blacks, the dynamic range is also improved. Apple is presumed to be planning an iPhone launch for September 2017, as per the usual tradition. But what’s special about next year’s reveal is that it marks the 10th anniversary of the original iPhone launch. That’s why many spectators assume Apple will make significant changes to the handset, at least compared to previous years. Of course, Apple hasn’t confirmed any details about the iPhone 8, so take all leaks with due caution.

This event occurred over the weekend at at Tatung University and, at first, seemed innocuous enough. Speaking about displays isn’t off-topic for Sharp’s CEO, but revealing Apple’s future is. A switch by Apple from LCD to OLED would be a big move, especially since it’d be the first major update to iPhone displays in years. It’s difficult to understand how the CEO of Sharp would think that speaking about such details would be OK. There’s no way we’ll see any public consequences as such, but we can’t help but think he’ll get a slap on the wrist. It wouldn’t be out of the question for Apple to work with Sharp on the next iPhone release. Tai is also an executive at Sharp’s parent company: Foxconn Technology Group. “The iPhone has been evolving and now it is switching from LTPS (low-temperature poly-silicon) to OLED panels,” [translated] said Tai at Tatung University. “We don’t know whether Apple’s OLED iPhones will be a hit, but if Apple doesn’t walk down this path and transform itself, there will be no innovation. It is a crisis but it is also an opportunity.” The first report comes from Nikkei, who also provide the photo (by Debby Wu) of Jeng-wu Tai at the event at which he spoke. “We are now building a new [OLED] facility in Japan. We can make [OLED panels] in the U.S. too,” said Tai, “If our key customer demands us to manufacture in the U.S., is it possible for us not to do so?” Nikkei has also reported that Apple will have three iPhones to present in the year 2017. Two could continue to use LTPS panels that they already use, while a third would be bigger. This third device, rumored to carry the name “iPhone Pro” would have a 5.5-inch OLED display. That display would have a curve to it – though at this point we can’t be sure of where that curve would curve. In summation, it’s clear that we’re already in the season for iPhone 8 rumors just a short bit after the iPhone 7 has been released in earnest. Now we’re prepping for the device that may or may not be made extra-special because of the 10-year anniversary of the original iPhone’s reveal and release. If Tai is correct, Apple may be on track to create a device that leaves previous iPhones in the dust.

October 31 AAPL: 113.54 -0.18 MacBook Pro Diary: My take on some of the criticisms being levelled at the new models Ben Lovejoy - 2 weeks ago @benlovejoy Feature MacBook Pro MacBook Pro Diary View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit The new MacBook Pro models have been coming under a fair amount of criticism on the Internet. Many are saying that the new machines just aren’t wowing them, especially just after Microsoft demonstrated that it is still possible to do so even in the boring old desktop PC market with the new Surface Studio. That criticism is absolutely fair enough, and echoes my own views when I said that I was buying it despite not being excited by it. But some criticisms being directed at the machines seem to me to be misplaced … Many have been saying that Apple has launched a brand new model with a year-old CPU. That one isn’t fair: right now, Skylake is the latest processor available in i7 quad-core form. The Kaby Lake version won’t be available until December if Intel delivers it on time, which is never a certainty. Microsoft, it should be noted, did exactly the same thing in sticking to Skylake in its shiny new computer. Sure, Apple could have waited, but there are a couple of downsides to that. First, it would have further delayed an update to a machine we were all complaining was now four years old. Second, Kaby Lake isn’t going to be a massive improvement over Skylake – it’s very much a second ‘tock’ update – so it would have been a further delay for limited benefit. And it wouldn’t – as some are suggesting – simply have been a one-month delay, from November to December. Once the new chips are available, Apple would need to do a lot of testing before they were ready for release. As Gizmodo noted: While Samsung wasn’t mentioned, the horror show that’s been the Note 7’s launch and subsequent recall can’t be ignored in this context. The now famous screw up involved a huge company that reportedly rushed a product to market, only to see it literally blow up in its customers’ faces. Second, there has been a lot of grumbling over the maximum 16GB RAM, even in maxed-out build-to-order machines. Phil Schiller says that’s for reasons of power efficiency. Should we take his word for it? Well, I can say one thing: Apple doesn’t usually like to leave money on the table. Historically, it has charged quite a steep premium for RAM upgrades, so if it isn’t even offering 32GB as an expensive option, there is likely a very good reason for that. To me, there’s no reason to doubt the one Schiller has given. Then there’s ports. Here I’ve heard both more and less reasonable comments. Engadget, for example, said this: Sadly, your fancy new iPhone 7 won’t directly connect to your new MacBook Pro. Think about that for a second. Two flagship devices from a company that prides itself on its ecosystem won’t connect to each other without a special converter. But that’s not exactly true. You do have to buy a new cable, yes, but you don’t need any clunky adapters. Now, if you want to instead argue that Apple should have included both USB-A and USB-C cables in the iPhone 7 box, I’ll agree entirely. It was silly to launch a new iPhone one month and a new Mac the following month and not supply a cable that would connect one to the other. But let’s not talk about dongles here. And most iPhone owners won’t even need that, as they probably never connect their iPhone to their Mac anyway. Most people use iCloud backup. A bigger complaint is the complete loss of all USB-A ports. Some have been saying that Apple should at least have included a mixture of old and new ports, but I disagree. Here’s what I said before: You could argue that a mix of ports would be useful, but that would be true for maybe the first year of ownership. After that, we’d be moaning about the fact that we have only two USB-C ports because there’s space taken up with those huge, ugly, old-fashioned USB-A ones. I think Apple made the right call here. It’s trading off a slight inconvenience now against spending most of the machine’s life (4-5 years for me) with two completely redundant ports. So I still say Apple got this right. Apple's fastest growing product category. pic.twitter.com/d1sel4N5Yc — Drew Breunig (@dbreunig) October 28, 2016 There was this amusing tweet about the 17 different dongles Apple now sells, with one piece suggesting that the new machine required users to buy $250 worth of dongles. This is, of course, pure clickbait. The reality for most users is that they’ll need one or two at most. I haven’t ever seen any stats, but my guess would be that the vast majority of MacBook owners never connect anything other than power to their machine. For those that do, mostly it will be just one or two USB devices, like a USB key and external drive. That requires exactly one dongle: a USB-A to USB-C adapter that costs $22 if you buy an Apple one or about $8 for a third-party one. Or, if it’s just a USB key, a $19 dual USB-A/USB-C one will allow connection to both old and new computers. Now, we’re techies, and we connect lots of things to our Macs, but even so, what I needed personally was exactly three adapters or cables: one each for USB-A, Thunderbolt 2 and Lightning. Most of my existing USB-A devices are connected through my monitor, so a single adapter is all I need for things like external drives. (Admittedly, things will get messier if I upgrade my monitor as well to one with USB-C ports, but that’s a separate issue.) I do agree with one port criticism: the loss of MagSafe. I’d really like to have retained this, so will be trying the Griffin Breaksafe which Chance reviewed to see whether that does the job. Which brings us to price … So far in our poll, this is the number one reason people aren’t buying the new models. The new machines are undoubtedly very expensive, but some have been suggesting that Apple has repositioned itself from a premium to a luxury brand where MacBooks are concerned. I don’t think that’s the case at all. We currently have $999 as the entry-point, for the 13-inch MacBook Air, just $100 up on the previous entry-level. That machine probably meets the needs of 95% of Mac owners, who use it for web, email, basic photo editing and maybe writing that novel. If you value sleekness enough, you can instead pay $1299 for a less powerful but sexier machine. The minority who need power can start at $1499 and go up to, well, the level I did. Bottom-line: there’s still something for everyone who was ever in Apple’s price-range at all. As for the shiny new MacBook Pro models, they are extremely expensive today, but I’d expect the price to fall in time. If you look at the precedent set by the 27-inch 5K iMac, it launched two years ago at a starting price of $2499. Apple’s current pricing starts at just $1799 (and you can get it for a bit less on Amazon and elsewhere). Now, the spec is different, but basically they launched the best machine they could at a high price, then a slightly more modest one at a much more affordable price. I wouldn’t be surprised to see the same thing happen here with MacBooks just as it has in the past. So sure, views vary, and it’s absolutely fine to criticize the new machines. But I think we do need to recognize that some of the criticisms being levelled at Apple over the new machines are, at the very least, over-blown.

READ MORE READ MORE READ MORE Share Geoffrey James Oct 31st 2016 9:36AM Regardless of whether Trump (the man) wins or loses, Trump (the brand) has already won. Several news stories recently suggested that Trump's campaign, fueled by his personal endorsement of his ability and right to commit sexual assault, was damaging the Trump brand. As evidence of this, CNN cited a report that bookings at his casinos and hotels are sharply down, prompting Trump to sidetrack to promote his recently-opened (and sparsely booked) Washington D.C. hotel. In addition, a grassroots group has been boycotting sales of Ivanka Trump's line of clothing. That Trump's favorability rating was down to 31 percent from a post-convention high of 38 percent would seem to lend credence to the notion that the Trump brand is a disaster the making. However, while a favorability rating 31 percent is exceedingly low for a presidential candidate this close to an election, it's actually much higher than the Trump brand has historically enjoyed. 14 PHOTOS Inside Donald Trump's $200M DC hotel See Gallery Inside Donald Trump's $200M DC hotel The hotel is located near the corner of Pennsylvania Avenue and 12th Street, just a short 15-minute walk to The White House North Lawn. Crystal chandeliers hang in the lobby. The hotel's ballroom — the largest in Washington, DC — was named the "Presidential Ballroom."

Facebook.com/trumpwashingtondc Rooms start at $460 a night for a deluxe room and go up to $12,000 a night for the presidential suite with unrestricted access to all amenities. Booking the Trump townhouse with amenities can set guests back $25,050 a night. There's also the very first Ivanka Suite, which costs $1,050 a night. Those amenities include the 10,000-square-foot spa and fitness center designed by Ivanka Trump. Facebook.com/trumpwashingtondc And as for the decor, you can't go far without seeing a Trump-branded product. Conference rooms are named after former presidents — and Trump. Dining options include David Burke's steakhouse BLT Prime and the Benjamin Bar & Lounge. BLT Prime has tables in the mezzanine, with views of the clocktower, but there's also more intimate seating available in the lower level. The decor was chosen by Ivanka Trump, partnering with the design firm HBA. Also on offer in the atrium's Benjamin Bar and Lounge: ounce-sized samplings of rare wines served on a silver spoon.

In other words, before Trump entered the political arena in 2011 by spreading racist lies about President Obama, the Trump brand enjoyed a favorability rating of 18 percent. Back then, he was only around half as popular as he is today. More important, many Trump's political supporters are wildly enthusiastic about him, so that the Trump brand almost seems to echo the product evangelism usually associated with strong corporate brands like Apple and Starbucks. As I've noted in a previous post, any brand that people really love will also have a set of people who loathe it. Consider: don't you know at least one person who hates the entire Apple fanboy shtick? It's true that many people who probably never gave the Trump brand a second thought five years ago now actively hate him and the brand alike. However, their hatred makes Trump's supporters love him all the more. That's how branding works. Weak brands create weak emotions which drive weak sales. Strong brands create strong emotions which drive strong sales. As long as those sales take place, it doesn't matter whether the strong emotions are negative or positive. In branding, love and hate are sides of the same coin. 70 PHOTOS Donald Trump supporters See Gallery Donald Trump supporters A masked supporter dances before Republican U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump arrives at a campaign town hall event in Wausau, Wisconsin April 2, 2016.

REUTERS/Carlo Allegri Up Next See Gallery Discover More Like This of SEE ALL BACK TO SLIDE SHOW CAPTION + HIDE CAPTION – In terms of the amount of pure emotion it creates, the Trump brand is arguably stronger than the Apple brand. While Apple sales dwarf Trump sales, that's comparing apples to orangeheads. When it comes to emotion, Trump beats Apple hands down. That's relevant in a business sense because the demographic profile of Trump's supporters matches the traditional demographic target of Trump's branded products. While the Trump brand is outwardly positioned as luxurious and upscale, it's always had its greatest appeal for the sort of down-scale wannabes who are impressed by lavish tackiness like solid gold bathroom fixtures. Trump's branded products--Trump Wine, Trump Steaks, Trump University, Trump's books, etc.--are targeted not at the rich but at those who hope, by aping Trump, to bask in a pale reflection of his lifestyle. In other words, Trump's political supporters are the very people to whom Trump has been hawking his products. By contrast, the people who now hate Trump and his brand were never his potential customers nor likely to become customers. Trump's reality TV show is a case in point. The primary appeal of The Apprentice was the working-class schadenfreude of watching Trump fire the kind of upscale professionals and celebrities who are doing quite well in the real world. Much like Trump's candidacy, The Apprentice was revenge fantasy for the downwardly mobile. Seen in that light, Trump's candidacy has raised the visibility of (and strengthened the attachment to) the Trump brand among those people who were and are most likely to buy Trump-branded products or stay at Trump properties. Which leads us to the election. Regardless of whether Trump wins or loses, he'll remain a hero to his supporters. Any products that he launches--and make no mistake, win or lose, there will be Trump-branded products--will sell well to his newly-loyal customer base. If, for instance, Trump launches his own television network in competition with Fox, it will begin broadcasting with huge brand equity, guaranteeing its success whether it's run out of Trump Tower (if he loses) or the White House (if he wins). So regardless of what happens on November 8, the Trump brand will emerge from the election burnished rather than tarnished. Indeed, from a branding perspective, Trump has already won, and won bigly. Those who believe that Trump's brand has taken a huge hit should remember the immortal words of H.L. Mencken: "No one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the American public."

All rights reserved Terms of use Privacy Sitemap The Intercept_ f t ✉ ⎕ 20 Photo: Issei Kato/Reuters/Newscom When the FBI Has a Phone It Can’t Crack, It Calls These Israeli Hackers Kim Zetter Kim Zetter 2016-10-31T15:12:14+00:00 Photo: Issei Kato/Reuters/Newscom Earlier this year, at the height of a very public battle between the FBI and Apple over whether the computer maker would help decrypt a mass murderer’s locked iPhone, it appeared that a little-known, 17-year-old Israeli firm named Cellebrite Mobile Synchronization might finally get its moment in the spotlight. After weeks of insisting that only Apple could help the feds unlock the phone of San Bernardino killer Syed Rizwan Farook, the Justice Department suddenly revealed that a third party had provided a way to get into the device. Speculation swirled around the identity of that party until an Israeli newspaper reported it was Cellebrite.  It turns out the company was not the third party that helped the FBI. A Cellebrite representative said as much during a panel discussion at a high-tech crimes conference in Minnesota this past April, according to a conference attendee who spoke with The Intercept. And sources who spoke with the Washington Post earlier this year also ruled out Cellebrite’s involvement, though Yossi Carmil, one of Cellebrite’s CEOs, declined to comment on the matter when asked by The Intercept. But the attention around the false report obscured a bigger, more interesting truth: Cellebrite’s researchers have become, over the last decade, the FBI’s go-to hackers for mobile forensics. Many other federal agencies also rely on the company’s expertise to get into mobile devices. Cellebrite has contracts with the FBI going back to 2009, according to federal procurement records, but also with the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Secret Service, and DHS’s Customs and Border Protection. U.S. state and local law enforcement agencies use Cellebrite’s researchers and tools as well, as does the U.S. military, to extract data from phones seized from suspected terrorists and others in battle zones. The company is poised to seize a prominent and somewhat ominous place in the public imagination; just as Apple has come to be seen as a warrior for digital protection and privacy against overreaching government surveillance, Cellebrite is emerging as its law-and-order counterpart, endeavoring to build tools to break through the barriers Apple and other phone makers erect to protect data. “Vendors … are implementing more and more security features into their product, and that’s definitely challenging for us,” says  Shahar Tal, director of research at Cellebrite. “But we’ve solved these challenges before [and] we continue to solve these challenges today.” In July, months after the unknown third party provided the FBI with a method for getting into the San Bernardino phone — an iPhone 5C running iOS 9 — Cellebrite announced that it had developed its own technique for bypassing the phone’s password/encryption lock. And the company is confident that it will be able to deal successfully with future security changes Apple may make to its phones in the wake of the San Bernardino case. “If it’s going to be done, it’s going to be done in this building,” Carmil told The Intercept during a visit to the company’s Israeli headquarters earlier this year. Cellebrite’s ascent comes at a time when mobile forensics has never been more important to law enforcement and intelligence agencies. Data extracted from phones has eclipsed data extracted from desktop and laptop computers in recent years, since the former can yield not only detailed logs about a user’s activities, interests, and communications, but also, in many cases, map the user’s whereabouts over weeks and months to produce a pattern of life.  The story of Cellebrite’s emergence as a forensic powerhouse is the story of how mobile forensics itself has evolved over the years — beginning first in the late ’90s with a simple tool for migrating user contacts from one cellphone to another, which morphed in 2007 to a solution for harvesting address book data from PDAs and feature phones, to the complex multistage operations needed today to bypass the sophisticated security mechanisms built in to smartphones. Ahead of Competitors Cellebrite isn’t the only forensic game in town. It has a number of rivals around the world, each with varying strengths and weaknesses. They include the Swedish firm MicroSystemation AB, also known as MSAB, whose XRY tool is used by the Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. military and others; the U.S. firms Susteen, Paraben, and BlackBag Technologies; Magnet Forensics, a Canadian firm; and Oxygen Forensics, a Russian firm whose customers include, according to its website, the IRS, U.S. Army, DOD, DHS, and the Justice Department. But Robert Osgood, an FBI supervisory agent for more than 25 years until he retired from the bureau in 2011, says that Cellebrite and MSAB are the leaders. “They’re the two 800-pound gorillas in the mobile forensic device world” when it comes to extracting data, says Osgood, who now directs a graduate program in computer forensics at George Mason University. “I would be lying to say it is still close — because I know that Cellebrite works better for acquisition.” —Heather Mahalik, advanced mobile forensics trainer, SANS Institute. Although he says the FBI buys other forensic tools, they are primarily used in specific niches — for example, parsing and analyzing subsets of data, such as data associated with social networking apps, after it has already been extracted using a Cellebrite or MSAB tool. Heather Mahalik, who trains about 400 federal and local law enforcement workers a year in advanced mobile forensics for the SANS Institute, says that even among these two giants, Cellebrite has been edging out its competitor over the last two years. “There are uniqueness and little tricks in both of them that really help … but I would be lying to say it is still close [between them], because I know that Cellebrite works better for acquisition,” she told The Intercept. Mahalik says she surveys her students each year to see which tools they’re using on the job. Two years ago, Cellebrite and MSAB were almost neck and neck, but these days, she says her students mention only Cellebrite. A 2012 annual report from MSAB acknowledges that Cellebrite penetrated the U.S. market before it did, which helped it gain an advantage as a result. Cellebrite’s forensic tools include the Universal Forensic Extraction Device (UFED), hardware bundled with proprietary software that acquires, decodes, and analyzes data from smartphones, tablets, and portable GPS devices; the UFED4PC, which is standalone software for use on a PC; and the UFED Pro, an add-on to the UFED that does something called physical extraction, which siphons data directly from a phone’s flash memory chip. This can include deleted SMS messages and call histories as well as data collected by the phone and apps that the user is unaware is being collected. The company doesn’t help governments remotely hack into phones for real-time surveillance, as the NSO Group, another Israeli firm, reportedly does; Cellebrite focuses only on forensics — collecting data and artifacts already created and stored on phones. Physical access to the phone is required for their work. Cellebrite’s edge lies in its ability to extract data from more mobile operating systems and chips than its competitors, often producing solutions faster than rivals. Each time a new version of a mobile phone or an update to an existing operating system is released, Cellebrite’s team of reverse engineers goes into assault mode to find zero-day vulnerabilities and other hidden pathways that will give the engineers access to data the phone makers have worked hard to block. In some cases, they’re already working on new phones before they’re released. That’s because some vendors — Cellebrite won’t say which ones, but Apple isn’t among them — ship a sample of their new phones to Cellebrite three months before they’re released, giving Cellebrite engineers a head start in cracking the devices. It’s a practice that dates back to the company’s original business, selling gear to cellular carriers that helped their customers migrate contacts from one phone to another.  The company doesn’t put all of its forensic techniques into its automated tools, however. To prevent competitors from reverse-engineering its software to uncover and steal its unique methods and to prevent phone vendors from discovering the vulnerabilities used in its techniques and patching them, some exploits are only performed manually by its staff. Its new solution for extracting data from iPhone 5C’s running iOS 9 — the San Bernardino phone — can only be performed by a Cellebrite worker as part of the company’s Advanced Investigative Services division, also known as CAIS. This is a premium unlocking subscription service that costs $250,000 a year in the U.S., according to a DEA procurement record, and will also get customers help in bypassing encryption on the iPhone 4S and 5, the Samsung Galaxy S6 and Galaxy Note 5, and some Galaxy S7s, among other devices. Though Cellebrite will also unlock phones as a one-off service, for about $1,500 per phone. Bypassing encryption, the most vexing problem law enforcement faces today in mobile forensics, is one of Cellebrite’s biggest selling points. The company says it has been able to “crack the code to the screen locks” on a number of phone models, allowing it to access data on the phones without a password. “Encryption is a show stopper for most of the industry,” Tal told The Intercept. “Except for us.” Technology used to extract data from mobile phones, developed by Cellebrite, is pictured at an international forensic laboratory in Kabul, Afghanistan, on July 22, 2013.

The company is a subsidiary of the Japanese Sun Corporation, which took ownership of 80 percent of the firm in 2007. And although Sun doesn’t influence the company’s strategy or direction, Carmil says, its secretive corporate culture appears to have affected Cellebrite’s approach with the media. “We are not telling so much about ourselves. What we tell is what Sun has allowed us to publish,” Carmil told The Intercept. Cellebrite’s headquarters in Israel occupies several floors of a mid-sized office tower in Petach Tikva, a small city east of Tel Aviv that was once a malarial swamp until Jewish pioneers drained it in the 19th century to make way for citrus groves. The groves have largely been replaced today with hi-tech business parks like the one Cellebrite shares with IBM and Intel. Its modern office space was dim and quiet during an afternoon visit by The Intercept in June, except for the sound of Hebrew rock playing softly on a floor where researchers worked. Down a hallway leading to the research offices was a device lab resembling a large, highly organized shoe closet that contained more than 15,000 mobile handsets stored in carefully marked boxes. These are phones that Cellebrite has bought or received in advance from vendors over the years to analyze.  About 200 new phones arrive to the lab monthly, each containing different versions of operating systems and configurations, since carriers like Verizon and AT&T like to customize the branded phones they offer customers by tweaking the operating system to disable and enable different features. There are also burner phones – pre-paid throwaway phones that criminals and terrorists often favor because they offer anonymity – and phones from China that pose a special challenge to extracting data because they often lack uniformity and standardization in their design. Each phone that arrives to the lab gets a manual inspection to determine the software that’s running on it and any operating system changes the vendor has made since previous versions. A screen outside the device lab in Cellebrite’s office shows the system for tracking devices that have been assigned to researchers. Photo: Kim Zetter for The Intercept Cellebrite has five forensic research teams: the team that reverse-engineers phones to find zero-day vulnerabilities and other means of extracting data; a team that focuses on translating binary data into a readable format; a cloud data team; and two teams who work on analytics, which involves mining data to create leads from different sources of data — for example, to cross-reference data extracted from a phone to determine all the locations a suspect has been in the past month. The analytics team is also working on being able to automatically identify activity in video extracted from mobile devices — an act of violence, for example. The reverse-engineer team that Tal leads, which is responsible for finding ways into phones, has about two dozen people. “I don’t know what the NSA has for mobile research, but in the forensics industry I’ve not been made aware of any sizable research team like we have,” says Tal, who joined the company late last year after leading the vulnerability research team at the Israeli security firm Checkpoint.  All of this belongs to Cellebrite’s new life as a mobile forensics firm. But the company didn’t begin life in forensics. “In the forensics industry, I’ve not been made aware of any sizable research team like we have.” —Shahar Tal, director of research at Cellebrite. Cellebrite launched in December 1999 with a tool that was only designed to transfer the contents of an address book from one phone to another. Back then, transferring contacts was a time-consuming task that was generally done manually. But Cellebrite developed the Universal Memory Exchange, a handheld device that resembled the clunky credit card readers airline stewards use to charge for in-flight beers, which could transfer data between any two phones, regardless of make and model. They later added capabilities for backing up, restoring, and synchronizing data as well. They sold the device initially only to telecoms and phone stores — first in Israel and Europe, then in the U.S. By 2005 Cellebrite says the UME was in more than half of all Verizon and T-Mobile phone shops in the U.S, in addition to the phone departments of big-box chains like Best Buy and Wal-Mart, something The Intercept was unable to confirm. “Every place that offers cellular-handset selling, repair, and exchange activity, Cellebrite was there,” Carmil asserts.  The UME became so integral to the mobile phone business that any time a vendor launched a new phone, it shipped an advance sample to Cellebrite to ensure that the UME would work with it. “Because we got all of [the phones] from the mobile operators … no one could compete with our phone support offering for a long time,” says Carmil, who was vice president of Siemens’s commercial division in Israel before joining Cellebrite. “We came with 1,500 [phones] supported, where the competition … were struggling for 100 or 150.” Cellebrite touts this advance look at phones as one reason for its competitive advantage in forensics. Though MSAB and Paraben, which don’t receive advance phones, naturally downplay early research like this, saying it can be counterproductive. “Many of the times the device firmware will change so much before the release that a lot of the deep research required for forensics must be redone [if done in advance of a device’s release],” Amber Schroader, CEO of Paraben, told The Intercept. By 2006, Cellebrite was selling its UME devices to law enforcement and security forces in Israel and abroad. It was at this point that the company’s new customers developed a novel use for the UME that caught Cellebrite’s attention — they were using it to extract call logs and other data from phones seized in criminal investigations. The method worked well for generating investigative leads, but the extracted data wasn’t forensically sound to serve as evidence in court. So the customers, Cellebrite won’t say which ones, asked for a way to show courts that data hadn’t been altered after it was removed from a phone. Cellebrite only had 18 employees at the time, but Carmil and co-CEO Ron Serber immediately saw the potential in steering the company in a new direction. “We realized that there is a market [for mobile forensics] which is already existing and established,” Carmil says. The next year, they released their first forensic tool, which was basically an extension of the software they were already using to transfer, back up, and restore data, but with a hash function thrown in to certify the integrity of extracted data. “That was the beauty of the whole story,” Carmil says. “We brought the same capabilities to a completely different core business.”  A hash is a cryptographic representation of data. Run text or data through a mathematical algorithm and you get a value that represents the data. But alter the data or text, and you get a different hash when run through the same algorithm. By comparing the hash of data on a phone with the hash of data presented in court, prosecutors could show it hadn’t been altered. It can also verify that the output from two different forensic tools grabbed the same data — if hashes of the two sets of extracted data are the same. Over time, as the number of mobile phones and data formats grew, Cellebrite added features for decoding varying formats and analyzing extracted data.  The company wasn’t the first to enter the mobile forensics field. Micro Systemation beat them to it with a mobile forensics tool in 2003; Paraben came out with a forensic tool for PDAs in 2001, followed in 2004 by a tool for mobile phones. But Cellebrite’s solution could process data from CDMA and TDMA phones, unlike competitors.  It was easy to extract data from mobile phones a decade ago, says Leeor Ben-Peretz, executive vice president for products and business development at Cellebrite. The devices had none of the sophisticated security protections they have today and there was a lot of public documentation that detailed programming interfaces, so researchers for the most part didn’t have to reverse-engineer operating systems and applications to understand how they worked. All of that changed in January 2007 when Apple introduced the iPhone, a smartphone that blended music, email, text messaging, web browsing, camera, and desktop applications with an easy-to-use touchscreen interface. The following year, Apple added GPS to the phone. It was a forensic bonanza for law enforcement, but Apple wasn’t generous with its documentation the way other phone makers had been. And as subsequent versions of the iPhone came out, Apple added security protections, including encryption, that made it even more difficult to extract data. Cellebrite scrambled to expand its research team. Carmil won’t say why — he’s silent on a lot of things about the company — but it seems to have coincided with the forensic challenges the iPhone brought. Cellebrite went looking for skilled reverse engineers, particularly among former members of the Israeli military’s Unit 8200, the famed tech and signals intelligence unit where many of the country’s elite hackers and vulnerability researchers hone their skills. Tal, Cellebrite’s 33-year-old director of research, hails from the unit. The research efforts paid off and the company’s forensic business soared, as shown by federal procurement records, particularly among U.S. law enforcement. Cellebrite has held about 230 federal contracts over the years, with the first dating to late 2007 when it signed contracts with the DEA, Secret Service, and the Navy’s Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command. The National Guard Bureau of Tennessee purchased six UFED devices in 2008, noting in its procurement document that the DEA already had “over 200” of them. On September 11, 2009, the FBI appears to have signed its first contract with Cellebrite. And by the end of that year, the company says more than 4,500 UFED devices were in use around the world.

Photo: Paul J. Richards/AFP/Getty Images Something else was happening to push sales in the U.S., according to Christa Miller, Cellebrite’s former director of mobile forensics marketing from 2012 to 2015. Wireless carriers were storing customer text messages for only short periods of time, and law enforcement was desperate to find a way to get evidence from customer devices even after it vanished from telecom servers and after users deleted it from their phone, Miller says. So in November 2009, Cellebrite launched a new product, the UFED Physical Pro, to extract data from the flash memory chip of phones, including deleted data.  There are two primary ways to retrieve data from mobile phones — logical extraction and physical extraction. Logical focuses on content and data the phone allows you to extract naturally through its application programming interface, or API, such as contacts and text messages. Sometimes the method for extracting the data is well-documented, sometimes it’s not and requires reverse-engineering; but in general, the presence of the data is readily apparent to a user or piece of software. Physical extraction, by contrast, gets data from a phone’s flash chips that’s not normally available, like deleted information. In August 2010, Cellebrite developed the means to do physical extractions from iPhones on the market at the time. By 2012, the company was also able to extract deleted messages from BlackBerry and Motorola devices, the latter using a technique that bypassed the user lock.  And in 2014, Samsung’s Galaxy S4 family of devices fell to the company’s physical extraction methods as well. MSAB began offering its own physical extractions from flash memory in 2010. Cellebrite is secretive about its methods, but a lawsuit the company filed against MSAB in 2013, accusing its competitor of stealing its Samsung and BlackBerry techniques, offered a few clues about the company’s process. It asserted, in regard to Samsung devices, that the technique didn’t require the phones to be powered-down first to do the extraction and that the solution involved a vulnerability in the phone’s memory, or RAM. Cellebrite’s researchers also had to locate several “landing addresses” in the RAM where they could inject a custom bootloader they created. A bootloader is code built in to a smartphone that launches the phone’s operating system when someone turns on the device. But Cellebrite’s custom bootloader halts the normal boot process in a way that allows their tool to then access and read the phone’s memory. Cellebrite’s other solution, for the BlackBerry smartphone, relied on a vulnerability the company found in the process that BlackBerry phones used for authenticating BlackBerry software delivered from a desktop computer to the phones, which allowed them to load their bootloader to the phones. The Cellebrite bootloader, the company wrote in its lawsuit, piggybacked on the official signed BlackBerry bootloader, “thus tricking the extremely sophisticated BlackBerry security protocols” into allowing the Cellebrite bootloader to run on BlackBerry devices in place of the legitimate bootloader.  Methods like this for doing physical extractions, however, were soon thwarted by Apple and other vendors, who began to increase the security of their phones by encrypting data stored on the devices and adding other security protections. A physical extraction yields a greater wealth of information over a logical extraction, unless the data extracted is encrypted and therefore unreadable. The problem was particularly acute with iPhones. “Modern iPhones, if the user configures them correctly, are virtually impossible to get into,” says Osgood.  In June 2009, for example, Apple introduced full-disk encryption with iOS 3 and the iPhone 3GS (the term “full-disk encryption” has come to refer to routine encryption of all data stored on a device, even those, like the iPhone, that do not actually use a physical disk). It was the first stage in the Going Dark problem for law enforcement, though it was only a partial eclipse, since the encryption key was not user-generated but was generated from a unique ID embedded in the phone, which meant Apple still had the ability to unlock phones. With iOS4, Apple introduced a file-encryption scheme that used a key derived from the user’s password and the embedded ID. Apple also added a time delay of 80 milliseconds to password guesses, which made it harder, though not impossible, to bruteforce the user’s password. Then with iOS 8, Apple expanded the data it encrypted on the phone — photos, messages, contacts, call history — and added even more delay to password guesses. By the ninth failed password, the wait became an hour before another password could be tried. If the user enabled an erase feature, the decryption key would disappear altogether after 10 failed password attempts. Despite measures like these, Cellebrite has developed methods to get around or disable encryption in a number of phone models, including iPhones, though certainly not all of them. “If you can do it, the competitive barrier is huge,” says Ben-Peretz. “And this is where we excel.”  In June 2015, for example, Cellebrite developed a way to unlock Apple devices running iOS 8, without the risk of erasing the encryption key. Earlier this year, a forensic specialist in Italy, stymied by an iPhone 5 running iOS 8, reportedly paid $1,500 for a Cellebrite team to help get him into the phone. This doesn’t mean full-disk encryption isn’t still a challenge. Encryption is “definitely more complex than it was five years ago or 10 years ago,” Tal says. “There are more and more mechanisms involving encryption. … And today our typical forensic capability would be constructed out of several chains of blocks, each of which [is] solving a different technology layer or mechanism in order to provide the eventual result.” To defeat password locks and encryption, the company has developed custom bootloaders that in some cases can interrupt the boot process of the legitimate bootloader on a phone before the operating system loads and before the password-locking mechanism kicks in. The details of how it does this vary depending on the phone, says Tal. And the process for cracking an iPhone is much more complicated than this, though he won’t elaborate. A lawsuit Cellebrite filed last year against Oxygen Forensics touched on its solution for disabling the screenlock on some Samsung Android devices. According to a court document in the case, Cellebrite developed special lock disabler code — commands that can run on the phones, despite their screens being locked, and disable the locks. Cellebrite did something similar with LG Android phones, by identifying which files on the phone control the screen-locking function and manipulating them to disable the lock.

Photo: Jack Guez/AFP/Getty Images Limits of Encryption Cracking Bollö, the MSAB CEO, admitted that encryption is hard for his company to address, though he told The Intercept, “we have solutions for either working around or trying to bypass” encryption. Asked to elaborate on those methods, however, he couldn’t provide a clear example.  “It is not as simple as getting around encryption or not,” he wrote in an email. He noted that these days, the problem isn’t just the extra security and encryption built in to phones themselves, but also the encryption in mobile apps. “I think both Google and Apple have more than 2 million apps on their app stores, and each app has their own database or encryption — they are updated 10 times as often [as phone operating systems],” he said during an interview in the company’s Virginia office. “That’s a much bigger challenge than specific phones.” Indeed, each forensic tool can only extract data from a small percentage of apps, so they focus on the most popular ones that are likely to yield important forensic data. The data for each app requires decoding if it’s in a special format. And once data is extracted, it has to be analyzed and presented in a format customers can understand. This is largely what makes mobile forensic tools so expensive — the many variations of phones, operating systems and applications they have to address. Mobile forensic tools can cost $10,000 to $14,000 for the base tool or software, with an additional annual subscription for upgrades — the release notes for new versions of Cellebrite’s tools and software list dozens of mobile apps and mobile handsets and operating systems that are newly supported by each upgrade. Tal says the breakthroughs they achieve in cracking phones are rewarding, but his research team gets other satisfaction from the work. “You see murderers, you see child molesters get behind bars because of data that we extracted yesterday, and it’s a very immediate connection with the purpose of what we’re doing here,” he says. “We’re not just security researchers who work on this forensic capability to make money for the company; there’s a story behind this for the people.” Cellebrite, he insists, gives highly skilled researchers a more ethical and acceptable outlet for their talents than, say, selling vulnerabilities and exploits to questionable buyers as some researchers do. He doesn’t name names, but researchers at the Citizen Lab in Canada recently found that Cellebrite’s compatriots at the NSO Group had supplied iPhone zero-days to the United Arab Emirates government to install a spy tool on a phone used by a local human rights activist. “[T]here are a lot of very good people, very good talents in this space who don’t necessarily feel very comfortable working for someone who may sell their product to a foreign government that may or may not use it against journalists in their countries and oppressive regimes,” Tal says.  He says their customers are first-world Western law enforcement agencies and notes that he’s had interest from a lot researchers lately who have been expressing an interest in working for Cellebrite “because they know the research we do doesn’t go into the ‘shady’ areas. We have a strong ethics backbone, a clear-use case for our capabilities, and dramatically less potential for abuse should ‘evil customers’ attempt to deceive us.” This doesn’t mean that Cellebrite is without controversy. The company works at the epicenter of an increasingly important U.S. policy debate about government use of computing vulnerabilities and exploits for surveillance purposes and about how keeping those vulnerabilities secret leaves the devices of millions of people vulnerable to intruders of all sorts. Apple still doesn’t know what iOS vulnerability the mystery party used to help the FBI hack into the San Bernardino phone, leaving many iPhone users at risk of someone else using the same vulnerability on their phones. Tal says Cellebrite’s researchers have deliberated at times about disclosing vulnerabilities they found to vendors, but won’t say if they’ve actually disclosed any. “Sometimes we do want to disclose a vulnerability because we think that’s in the best interest of our customers and in the best interest of maintaining some aspect of privacy and security,” he says. “But then of course [the] forensics business is entailed with getting access to information the vendor maybe did not want you to have access to. So there’s somewhat of a delicate dance around this.” Related Contact the author: Kim Zetter✉kkzetter@​gmail.comt@kimzetter Additional Credits: Additional Reporting: Jenna McLaughlin.˅ ⎕ 20 Comments (closed) The Intercept_ Newsletter D × ✓ Weekly Digest ✓ Breaking Stories and Exclusives ⟶ Email list managed by MailChimp Filters SVG

Pingie.com revealed the change after reviewing a specific FAQ page for the new MacBook Pro, which did not mention the sound and confirmed its disappearance on a working version of the laptop. Scroll down for video  Apple ditched the startup chime in the new MacBook Pros since they automatically boot up when the lid is opened. Pingie.com revealed the change after reviewing a specific FAQ page for the new MacBook Pro and  confirmed its disappearance on a working version of the laptop HISTORY OF THE CHIME  The iconic startup sound has been part of the Mac in 1990s and although the Mac has drastically changed, the function was something that remained the same.  The F-sharp sound was used in the 2008 Pixar film Wall-E. Power Macs had an electronic jazz guitar strum and the 20th Anniversary Macintosh had a poppy remix of the classic bong as a tribute to the original Mac, reports Pingie.com. But all Mac computers post the iMac G3 have had the same sound – an F-Sharp cord sound modulated from a PowerMac startup sound. Apple also registered a trademark for the sound in 2012, which describes it as 'a synthesizer playing a slightly flat, by approximately 30 cents, G Flat / F Sharp major chord.' The iconic startup sound has been part of the Mac in 1990s and although the Mac has drastically changed, the function was something that remained the same – until now. This change could make it more difficult to pinpoint technical problem with the new MacBook Pro models, but it puts an end to the sound disrupting classes, meetings and other public events. Although the chime has been included in Macs since the beginning, it wasn't until the iMac G3 in 1998 was the iconic sound used.  The F-sharp sound was also used in the 2008 Pixar film Wall-E, when the animated robot used solar panels to charge itself.

Share this article Share 24 shares This change could make it more difficult to pinpoint technical problem with the new MacBook Pro models, but it puts an end to the sound disrupting classes, meetings and other public events Although Apple has yet to make an official comment on the change, it makes sense to kill the sound now that the new MacBook Pros automatically boots up when you open the lid, according to 9to5Mac. Apple unveiled a radical overhaul of its MacBook Thursday, which no longer has the traditional USB ports and function keys, replacing them with smaller USB-C ports and a smart touchscreen - and comes just weeks after the firm killed off the headphone socket in the iPhone 7.  The firm first confirmed it had killed off the function keys usually found on laptops, replacing it with a screen that changes depending on the app used. Different buttons appears depending on the app being used, and it even doubles as a fingerprint sensor. APPLE'S NEW MACBOOK PRO SPECS  The MacBook will also be available in a cheaper option with traditional function keys, Phil Schiller revealed. And it also has a Touch ID fingerprint sensor built into the power button At just 14.9 mm thin, the 13-inch MacBook Pro is 17 per cent thinner and 23 per cent less volume than the previous generation, and nearly half a pound lighter at just three pounds.  The new 15-inch MacBook Pro, at just 15.5 mm thin, is 14 per cent thinner and 20 per cent less volume than before, and weighing just four pounds, is nearly half a pound lighter.  Retina display on the new MacBook Pro is an 67 per cent brighter than the previous generation, features 67 per cent more contrast and is the first Mac notebook display to support a wide colour gamut. Apple has also slimmed down the new MacBook - so much so it is killing off the MacBook Air. The MacBooks will be available in 2-3 weeks, with the most expensive costing $2399, and the cheapest $1499,Apple said 'We haven't been using them for a long time, so we mapped other functions to them,' said Apple's Phil Schiller. 'Now, we are replacing them with the touch bar'. The F-sharp sound was also used in the 2008 Pixar film Wall-E (pictured) , when the animated robot used solar panels to charge itself. Apple has not made an official comment o, it makes sense to kill the sound now that the new laptops automatically boot up when you open the lid Just days after Apple announced it killed the function keys on the MacBook Pro, its been revealed the tech giant has another victim. The OLED strip above the keyboard is expected to be called a 'magic toolbar' and will change depending on which app is being used. The touch bar is a small touchscreen, which changes depending on the app being used. It also has a Touch ID fingerprint sensor built into the power button. App makers including Microsoft have already begun including support for it into their software, Schiller said. This is the gold standard in notebooks,' said Schiller.

RELATED ARTICLE What Is Android Auto, and Is It Better Than Just Using a Phone in Your Car? What Is CarPlay? Basically, CarPlay is iOS for your car. It’s not necessarily a blown up version of your phone (which really wouldn’t make sense), but rather a simplified interface for easy use in a vehicle. It does all the basic stuff: phone calls, maps, music, and text messages using your voice. The idea is to keep your eyes on the road and not on your phone. When it comes to getting CarPlay in your ride, there are two ways that can happen: buy a car with a CarPlay-ready system already installed, or buy an aftermarket head unit. While buying a new vehicle is clearly going to be the easiest way to get CarPlay, it’s also the most expensive—not to mention that if you’re not in the market to buy a new car, well, it’s highly impractical. In that case, just roll with an aftermarket head unit—I’m using a Kenwood DDX9903S and can’t say enough good things about it. Pioneer and JBL are also leading the charge with aftermarket CarPlay units. Regardless of the direction you go, however, the core experience will pretty much be the same. The interface is very Apple-esque (naturally), so moving from phone to car is a pretty seamless experience. CarPlay is basically comprised of a main screen with shortcuts to all your currently-installed applications. The sidebar on the left-hand side always houses the “home” button, as well as apps that are running in the background that require attention, like Maps. The biggest thing CarPlay has going for it is, surprisingly, Siri. If you have “Hey Siri” enabled, CarPlay gets infinitely more useful—you no longer have to actually touch the head unit itself for most actions. Instead, just say “hey Siri, do the thing” and she’ll do the thing…most of the time. Sometimes she has a hard time figuring out what it is you want, but I’l get to that more in a moment. Now, don’t get it twisted: CarPlay is not a standalone product. The head unit will have a USB input where you’ll use your own Lightning cable to connect your phone to the head unit. On the upside, this also charges your phone. That’s pretty awesome. And since CarPlay is built into all modern iOS devices, you don’t have to install anything to get started—just plug in and you’re pretty much good to go. So what’s your phone doing while CarPlay is running? The same thing CarPlay is doing. For example, if you’re using Maps on CarPlay, it will also show up on your iPhone’s screen. Same thing for Pandora or Spotify. This isn’t true for apps that aren’t CarPlay compatible, though—for example, if you’re using Maps on CarPlay, then open Pokemon Go on your phone, CarPlay will go back to the home screen and do nothing while the phone opens the game. You can’t do one thing on CarPlay, and another on the phone. Where CarPlay Falls Short All of that sounds pretty useful, and it is–but there are a few places where CarPlay is still a little janky. “Hey Siri”, for example, is a very nice feature to have, but the interpretation just isn’t very good half the time. For example, I told Maps to navigate to CVS pharmacy on a specific street, and it returned results for a slew of different CVS Pharmacies—none of which were the one I wanted. It had no idea where I wanted to go until I gave the exact address. That’s not very useful. This brings me to my second point: the third-party apps are pretty limited. For example, you are essentially stuck with Apple Maps—Google Maps on CarPlay is simply not an option. While Apple Maps is much better than it used to be, it’s still nowhere near Google Maps’ level. The scenario above basically proves that—try telling Apple Maps a location with very little info, then try the same thing with Google Maps. You’ll see what I mean. To add insult to injury, there’s also the subject of cost: CarPlay-compatible head units are pretty darn expensive. The one I’m using, for example, pushed well over the $1000 mark if you include the cost of installation. That’s a pretty pricey upgrade just to simplify your life a little bit. If you’ve got the extra income, however, it’s so nice to have, shortcomings be damned. Of course, that leads us to a bigger question. How Is It Different than Using Your Phone with a Dock? If a CarPlay unit costs $1000, why not just buy a $7 mount for your phone and call it a day? CarPlay definitely has its benefits: its bigger screen and simpler interface are just a more car-friendly experience. You can call people more easily, and control your tunes without really taking your eyes off the road. Basically, it’s safer, which is nice. But your phone still does more, and while CarPlay is great when you have “Hey Siri” enabled, so is the iPhone! Basically, if you’ve got a Bluetooth head unit already in your car and a decent docking setup, you’re probably in a good enough situation that you don’t necessarily need CarPlay. That said, when it comes time to get a new car, it wouldn’t hurt to make that one of the things on your wishlist. If you use navigation a lot, though, that could be a different story. Navigation uses a lot of horsepower: both battery and processor. In a situation where your phone is in a dock on the dash, it can overheat pretty easily (depending on the outside temperature, of course) when pushing music and navigation. CarPlay easily remedies that. So, Is CarPlay Worth It? Ultimately, CarPlay better than just using a phone, but it’s also quite expensive if you’re not looking to buy a new car. It’s almost certainly not $1000+ better than using your phone in a dock, but if you have the money to burn, go for it. If, however, you’re in the market for a new car, do yourself a favor and get a CarPlay-compatible one. There’s really no reason not to get one, after all, since even base model vehicles are shipping with stuff for 2017. You’ll be happy you did.

The report noted that Apple's iPad Pro, the iPad Air and Mini lines have been the models with mass appeal, accounting for more than two-thirds of its shipments this quarter. Although Apple's tablet shipments declined 6.2% year over year, total iPad-related revenues were flat for the quarter, thanks to the iPad Pro offering. For Q3 2016 Apple remained the top Tablet Vendor worldwide holding 21.5%. Samsung was in second place with 15.1%, Huawei was in fifth spot with 5.6% and Microsoft with all of their bravado of having the best tablets in the world couldn't even crack the top five vendors. And remember, according to IDC back in August, Microsoft's Surface tablets will catch up to Apple's iPad by 2020. So Microsoft better get into high gear because at the moment they're nowhere to be found on the top worldwide list.   In May of this year, J.D. Power's 2016 U.S. tablet satisfaction study Apple was number one with Microsoft being a close second. I repeat, a close second. But last week, during Microsoft's Surface PC event, without any proof provided, Microsoft's Corporate VP for Surface, Panos Panay, stated the following:   "I could throw a lot of data at you, but just let me simplify. Surface Book today has the highest customer satisfaction among any current Windows 10 machine out there or any MacBook, all of them. Way best."   Surface Book is a tablet, and more specifically a hybrid, and in that category every Surface device including the Surface Book was second to Apple's iPad Pro. This wasn't a hybrid vs. pure notebook customer satisfaction award it was the best tablet/hybrid. Panos tried to just wish his product to victory over Apple's product in a new category no one ever heard of.   In Q4 2015 Apple's iPad Pro was the top detachable and in Q2 2016 as well and has never lost their number one position all year long.   IDC further noted that "Low-Cost Detachables and Slates in the Lead as Tablet Market Slump Persists in the Third Quarter." More specifically low-cost detachables are sub-$200 devices. This low-cost detachable tactic by Apple's competitors will eventually overtake Apple in the standings and if IDC was honest they would separate these devices accordingly because Apple doesn't make sub-$200 tablets and likely never will.   During Apple's financial conference call last week, Apple's CFO stated that For the September quarter, Apple had 82% market share in tablets over $200. So where oh where did Microsoft fit into the remaining 16% when they couldn't even get into the top 5 tablet vendors worldwide? That statistic alone makes Panos Panay look like a dreamer in La-La-Land. Every Surface device is over $200 and Apple owned 82% of the market. So where oh where are these statistics to say that customer satisfaction is higher for Surface?   The crazy stat from IDC for Q3 was Amazon having   year-over-year growth of 319% yet only sold 3.1 million tablets – and these were at what …. $50? Even with almost giving them away Amazon couldn't compete with Apple's iPad. I mean, who wants more electric junk around the house collecting dust, right?   According to a mid-2016 Bloomberg report, "Apple may roll out the new iPad software features as part of an upgrade to the iOS 10 operating system in the first half of 2017, or save the enhancements for the next major iOS version later in the year.   Pencil, a handwriting and drawing stylus aimed at professionals, according to one of the people. Apple has considered allowing users to annotate objects in many applications across the whole operating system, including in Mail, the Safari web browser, and iMessage, similar to what Samsung Electronics Co. offers on its Note smartphones, the person said. Currently, Apple only supports Pencil functionality in specifically developed apps.   The new iPad hardware will include faster display technology that allows for smoother zooming, panning and scrolling, one of the people said. Apple isn't planning to update its iPad lineup until next year, when a new version of the iPad Pro will be released with a 10.5-inch display, up from the current 9.7-inch display."   At the end of the day the iPad continues to dominate the tablet market worldwide, owns 82% of the tablet market above $200 and is planning for some great updates in the first half of 2017 to keep their winning streak alive.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Contraction in the global tablet market outpaced Apple's, falling 10% during the quarter but average selling prices (ASPs) were up slightly higher at 7% due to many more vendors shifting resources toward 2-in-1 Tablets and away from traditional Slates, according to the new "Preliminary Global Tablet Shipments and Market Share: Q3 2016" report from Strategy Analytics' Tablet & Touchscreen Strategies (TTS) service. Logo- http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20130207/NE56457LOGO-b The associated report is published here: http://sa-link.cc/TabletsQ316 Peter King, Service Director, Tablet & Touchscreen Strategies service said, "Microsoft has led a transformation in the tablet market with its Surface Pro and Surface Book. Apple is now reliant on iPad Pro for tablet and laptop replacement, while many other PC OEMs abandon Android Slates in favor of more expensive 2-in-1 Windows Tablets for better productivity and versatility." Eric Smith, Senior Analyst, Tablet & Touchscreen Strategies service added, "Even as strong 2-in-1 Tablet demand contributes to rising ASPs, prices are falling for these devices into a sweet spot where consumers can now justify replacing one or more computing devices with a single 2-in-1 Tablet. The wave of growth we expect in the next several years is based on this trend as well as hastened adoption among enterprises over the next several years." Tablet Market Results by Vendor Preliminary analysis of vendor performance in Q3 2016 has shown that Samsung, Asus, and the White Box community of vendors continue to lose ground to newer players in the market, while Apple stabilizes its iPad business. Meanwhile, Lenovo has bounced back and forth between positive and negative growth in 2016 as it faces fierce competition in Asia from its archrival, Huawei. Amazon has achieved strong sales of its $49 7-inch Fire Tablet, reaching a broad range of consumers looking for an entertainment tablet with key content tie-ins to the growing Amazon ecosystem.

Business use cases for tablets are multiplying too, as mobility becomes more important and touch eases its way into workflows. Apple iOS shipments (sell-in) fell 6% annually at 9.3 million iPads in Q3 2016 leaving it with a worldwide market share of 20% of the Tablet market. Meanwhile, ASPs climbed 6% year-on-year to $459 as a higher mix of premium Pro devices boosted revenue. Android-branded vendors shipped 30.1 million units among them worldwide in Q3 2016, down 17% from 36.0 million a year earlier and down 1% sequentially. Market share has fallen to 65% as high growth of Windows tablet shipments squeeze Android tablets. Windows shipments grew 25% year-on-year at 7.3 million units in Q3 2016, from 5.8 million in Q3 2015, reaching 16% market share.

When Apple unveiled its original watch in 2014, the California company touted three tent-pole features of the new wearable: style, communication and fitness. Rolling out the second-generation Apple Watch this week, Apple has positioned fitness, and fitness alone, as the device’s main selling point. High-end fashion, and friend-to-friend gestures like the heartbeat share, were hardly mentioned. Exercise was the unrivaled star of the watch reveal. Tim Cook’s keynote introduced the new “Series 2” device with a promotional video dominated by sports: color bursts of swimming, tennis, basketball, cycling, stairs, skateboarding, jogging and on and on. The watch’s featured hardware changes, in addition to the requisite processor upgrade, were a GPS chip and a new “swimproof” water rating. The upgraded operating system, watchOS 3, is all about fitness too: new Activity watch faces, workout sharing, additional health metrics, and a new “Breathe” app. Cook called the watch the “ultimate device for a healthy life.” He said he expected the new version to be “especially popular with runners” – and proceeded to invite Nike’s brand chief to introduce a full-fledged, standalone unit: the Apple Watch Nike+. The Nike version, with its own specialized bands and watch faces, was hailed as the “perfect running partner.” The Series 2 announcement did include a brief mention of new Hermés bands, as well as enhanced emojis and a “Scribble” finger-drawn input system. But the original tripartite pitch – style, communication and health – was reduced to a single, focused sell: the Apple Watch is a fitness device. And with that shift Apple has substituted a strand of self-improvement – disciplined and quantitative – for its longstanding appeals to iconoclastic self-expression. Forget fashion, follow the market to fitness Recall that the original watch was promoted with videos narrated by designer Jony Ive, with purring, pornographic attention to design and exotic materials. Crucial to the original roll-out campaign was a relentless effort to link the watch to the fashion world: the Self, Flare and Vogue China covers, the 12-page ad spread (and glowing Ive profile) in U.S. Vogue, the in-store boutiques at Galleries Lafayettes and Selfridges, the high-profile hires from Burberry to L.V.M.H. Equally prominent, in that first unveiling, were the watch’s communication features. The Dick Tracy phone calls, the intimate “Digital Touch” messaging, the dedicated “Friends” side button: The stress, back in 2014, was on new, “subtle ways to communicate.” With the Series 2 version, most of that fell away. Even the side button has been repurposed as an app-loading dock. And now it’s your Activity rings – the addictive circles that track standing, movement and exercise – you’re encouraged to share. The business angle of Apple’s pivot to fitness isn’t that interesting. The company is following its customers and the broader wearables market – where lower-cost wristbands like Fitbit are reportedly picking up market share. The Nike+ deal isn’t an aspirational bid to tap an underserved market. Instead, right now at least, exercise tracking is the reason consumers are buying smart watches and “basic” wearables like the Fitbit. The intriguing thing about Apple’s shift in marketing is its elevation of self-improvement over self-expression. The original watch was promoted as a custom display of personal style – as an identity statement on par with clothing. Cook described the original watch as the “most personal device Apple has ever created,” and the device’s web copy reinforced the point: Apple Watch is “more than a tool. It’s a true expression of your personal taste.” Or, in a later rendition: “From the way it works to the way it looks, Apple Watch isn’t just something you wear. It’s an essential part of who you are.” The new web copy, however, drops all the expressive language: The Series 2 Watch is “designed for all the ways you move,” full of features that “help you stay active, motivated and connected.” Apple Watch: Sport over style? Apple switches its flavor of self-help The shift represents a victory of one mode of self-help over another. As sociologist Micki McGee observed in Self-Help, Inc., a pair of ethics have long competed in the American self-improvement market, one emphasizing self-mastery and the other self-discovery. Think Tony Robbins versus Oprah Winfrey: Robbins asks us to treat ourselves as objects to (relentlessly) work on, while Winfrey preaches meditative fulfillment. Each ideal, in turn, draws on a different strand of Western individualism: the notion that the self is something we own, versus the competing idea that the self is to be discovered and expressed. The first ethic, the possessive individualism of philosopher John Locke, helped provoke the second notion of self discovery, as expressed in the literary and artistic Romanticisms of the 19th century. Since then – for over a century in the American case – these two ideals have been hitched to selling consumer goods. Apple has traditionally wrapped its products in the second ideal of self-expression and discovery: the iconic 1984 sledgehammer ad, the “Think Different” and “I’m a Mac/I’m a PC” campaigns, candy-colored iMacs and all those silhouetted iPod dancers. Apple is selling the Series 2 Watch, by contrast, on the self-mastery ethic. It’s less “Here’s to the crazy ones” and more lap-counts and “achievement” badges. What’s novel about Apple’s move is that self-discipline is getting delegated to a device. In a sense, watch wearers are outsourcing their superegos to a publicly traded company, the world’s most valuable. With every tap-to-stand and Activity report – “a nudge when you need it” – the watch becomes more like a personal trainer, one coded by Apple engineers. By baking in fitness-sharing (“Healthy loves company”), the new watch appeals to social comparison and competition too – “whether it’s to send encouragement or a little smack talk.” And Apple’s exercise-centric messaging is built around quantitative self-monitoring, via bar graphs and calorie counts and beats-per-minute tallies. The Series 2 “tracks all the ways you move throughout the day,” reads new web copy. “Select up to five metrics to view at once.” Exercise is a good thing. But we shouldn’t pretend the design and promotion of devices like the Apple Watch are value-neutral. By the time they’re slotted under flawless in-store glass, they already have a set of ideals preinstalled. In the Apple Watch case, those values reflect their California origins: Our selves are objects to work on, to sculpt and measure, in competition with others. Indeed, the watch echoes the subculture of dedicated self-quantifiers, who – to a deliberate extent – define themselves in metrical terms. The watch’s new “Breathe” app is a fascinating case in counterpoint. The app, which encourages periodic deep breathing, is meant to “help you practice mindfulness every day.” Here is a reminder of Silicon Valley’s long flirtation with New Age mysticism – as well as the gauzy repurposing of Buddhist meditation for the self-help industry. If anything, the Breathe app is a throwback to Apple’s expressivist marketing campaigns. And in that respect the new watch echoes a century-old American injunction: If you want to get ahead, go find yourself.

 There's a good argument that Apple should buy Netflix Nathan McAlone Oct. 31, 2016, 10:40 AM 14,412 facebook linkedin twitter email print Reed Hastings, founder and CEO of Netflix. Gonzalo Fuentes/Reuters Last week, Apple finally revealed its grand plan to conquer your TV: a new Apple TV app that brings all your shows and movies together in one place and serves you recommendations. The idea makes sense. Apple thinks apps are the future of TV, and that eventually you will have separate subscriptions to Netflix, HBO, Showtime, Hulu, and so on — maybe you already do. In that world, it will be annoying to have to navigate a bunch of different interfaces and menus. So Apple will do it for you with a new app called TV, which not only works on your Apple TV, but also on your iPhone or iPad. Apple's TV app will provide you with one place to find new shows to watch, pick up shows where you left off, and buy episodes or seasons from iTunes. It's "the one place to access all your television," CEO Tim Cook said last week. With this app, you can see the outline of Apple's ambitions for Apple TV: a universal search, browse, and suggestion platform that fetches you the right content as fast as possible. Business Insider Sorry, Apple But there's a big problem with Apple's vision — Netflix and Amazon don't seem to be on board. Neither company, so far, will be part of Apple's new TV app. Netflix, which told Business Insider it is still evaluating the opportunity, is a particular blow. Why is Netflix wary? In note this morning, Stratechery analyst Ben Thompson explains it this way: "Apple's desire to be 'the one place to access all of your television' implies the disintermediation of Netflix to just another content provider, right alongside its rival HBO and the far more desperate networks who lack any sort of customer relationship at all. It is directly counter to the strategy that has gotten Netflix this far — owning the customer relationship by delivering a superior customer experience." Netflix's direct relationship with its customers is valuable, and it doesn't want to give that up. And the problem for Apple is that without Netflix (and Amazon, increasingly), the TV app isn't compelling. In our current TV landscape, if you don't have these two streaming heavyweights, you aren't providing a "unified TV experience," as Cook said Apple wanted. Business Insider This is a position Apple doesn't normally find itself in. Thompson pointed to Apple's domination of the music industry, which played out very differently. "The truth is that Apple's executives seem stuck in the iPod/iTunes era, where selling 70% of all music players led to leverage over the music labels," he wrote. But the Apple TV is just another streaming box, and Netflix can already put its content on it with its own app. Unfortunately for Apple, "selling hardware isn't a point of leverage," according to Thompson. That's why Thompson makes the case that Apple should buy Netflix. "If Apple wants its usual ownership of end users it needs to buy its way in, and that means buying Netflix," he wrote. Analysts at Bernstein also argued earlier this month that Apple could use Netflix to create a competitor to Amazon's Prime bundle and move Apple away from a transactional business model toward a subscription-based one. Whatever the reason, Apple would likely have to pay a hefty premium, and Netflix might not want to sell. But Apple's current strategy just doesn't have the juice to conquer TV without Netflix and Amazon. It needs something else.

Tablet Market Results by Vendor Preliminary analysis of vendor performance in Q3 2016 has shown that Samsung, Asus, and the White Box community of vendors continue to lose ground to newer players in the market, while Apple stabilizes its iPad business. Meanwhile, Lenovo has bounced back and forth between positive and negative growth in 2016 as it faces fierce competition in Asia from its archrival, Huawei. Amazon has achieved strong sales of its $49 7-inch Fire Tablet, reaching a broad range of consumers looking for an entertainment tablet with key content tie-ins to the growing Amazon ecosystem.

Apple iOS shipments (sell-in) fell 6% annually at 9.3 million iPads in Q3 2016 leaving it with a worldwide market share of 20% of the Tablet market. Meanwhile, ASPs climbed 6% year-on-year to $459 as a higher mix of premium Pro devices boosted revenue. Android-branded vendors shipped 30.1 million units among them worldwide in Q3 2016, down 17% from 36.0 million a year earlier and down 1% sequentially. Market share has fallen to 65% as high growth of Windows tablet shipments squeeze Android tablets.

October 31 AAPL: 113.54 -0.18 IDC: Apple continues to lead tablet market slump, iPad Air and mini outselling iPad Pro line Jordan Kahn - 2 weeks ago @JordanKahn Apple View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit In IDC’s latest report covering worldwide tablet sales, Apple continues and increases its lead as the overall market continues to decline 14.7% year-over-year. Of an estimated 43 million units total shipped in Q3, which IDC notes is actually up almost 10% from Q2 as companies prepare for the holiday quarter, Apple managed to grab 21% of the market with 9.3 million units shipped. In the report, IDC claims that Apple’s iPad Air and iPad mini shipments proved more popular despite the launch of the new iPad Pro line. The more expensive Pro line, however, contributed significantly to iPad revenues remaining flat year-over-year as shipments fell 6.2%: Despite Apple’s marketing push for the iPad Pro, the iPad Air and Mini lines have been the models with mass appeal, accounting for more than two-thirds of its shipments this quarter. Although Apple’s tablet shipments declined 6.2% year over year, total iPad-related revenues were flat for the quarter, thanks to the iPad Pro offering. Apple announced its earnings for the third quarter last week, its fiscal Q4, confirming the iPad sales number IDC is using in its report today. That’s down from 9.9 million iPads in the previous quarter and 9.8 million in the year ago quarter. Samsung manages to maintain its number two position behind Apple despite a 19.3% decline to 6.5 million units compared to last year’s Q3. IDC says its data doesn’t show any significant impact from the recall of the defective Samsung Galaxy Note 7, but attributes the decline to an “overreliance on the declining slate market” and poor sales of the detachable TabPro S device. Amazon grabs third place with 319% year-over-year growth thanks to its Fire flash sales during Amazon Prime Day and other sales where it deeply discounted its Fire tablet line. Lenovo follows in fourth with a 10.8% decline, and Huawei manages fifth place with 28.4 year-over-year growth. blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

There are so many new things to learn and it can certainly get frustrating! From the layout of the phone screens to new messaging features, the changes are endless, and now we have even more reasons to procrastinate with our phones. Apple has decided to make a big change to how the iPhone is unlocked. Instead of swiping right, now the home button has to be pressed. This can definitely be a bit confusing, as our fingers tend to automatically swipe our screens to the right, but instead of unlocking the device this brings you to a screen of short cuts. This new feature seems to be one that will take the longest time to get accustomed to.  The layout of text messaging has been completely transformed. There are now four different options on the top bar: camera, digital touch, music GIF and the text box. The camera option now allows you to not only have easy access to picture selection, but also to take pictures on the bottom of the text screen. This feature simplifies the process of sending pictures over text messages. Digital touch allows people to send handwritten messages or sketches as well as digital heartbeat designs through text messages. This takes creativity through text messages to a whole new level, as people can now interact through hand written images. Next, Apple has included a new feature of sending music or GIFs through text. GIFs have become very popular over the past year, and Apple users are definitely getting a kick out of communicating through the moving images. Lastly, the text box remains the same, except for the small change of removing the ‘Send’ button and simplifying it to an arrow.  Another texting feature is the ability to react to messages. This feature is very similar to Facebook, but there are some additional reactions. The features include: heart, thumbs up, thumbs down, ‘ha-ha’, exclamation and question mark. Now Apple users can take their emotions in communication to a whole new level!  The layout for photos has been transformed into a more organized and easily accessible app. Another album, Faces, has been added, called Faces, which allows Apple users to easily access the different people in their photos. The memories feature puts together photos based on their location and gives a recap of the “best of the last three months.” The photos application has been updated for better usage and easier access to pictures.  Overall, Apple has gone above and beyond with iOS 10. It has definitely succeeded in pleasing iPhone users, although it may take a while for some people to adjust. With the new devices coming out, Apple is introducing a whole new generation of technology and there are many exciting things to look forward to. To all iPhone users out there, even though they can be very addictive and fun, try not to get too carried away with the new features!  By Co Editor-in-Chief Follow Co Editor-in-Chief Get Top Stories Delivered Weekly Please enter Email More villanovan News Articles GlobalSmackDown: Agreement in South China Sea shifts power balance Ten Things to Look Forward to in November and the fall season Disney’s newest film, ‘Moana’, makes a splash for the Thanksgiving season Why should we serve?

This feature will give developers an official way to provide access to in-app purchases to testers, the press, and other influencers. Apple says promo codes for in-app purchases are limited to 100 codes per in-app purchase item, with up to a maximum of 1,000 codes per app within a six-month period - which resets on January 1 and July 1. Developers can request codes from iTunes Connect in My Apps > Features. Apple on its resource page says users must have access to Admin, App Manager, Legal, or Marketer role to generate codes. As before, promo codes are valid for 28 days from the day they are generated. Apple states promo codes can also be given for auto-renewable subscriptions, and also as before, to provide a free copy of an app.The move will be beneficial to app developers who previously had to resort to unofficial workarounds to provide in-app purchases to reviewers and testers. Apple has recently made changes to the App Store in order to make it easier for developers to sell their wares, and for users to discover them. Earlier this month, the company enabled Search Ads - search-related advertising that is meant to be a non-intrusive way for app developers to surface their products in user searches. Search Ads were unveiled alongside several changes to the App Store in June, including a major shift in the revenue model for auto-renewed paid apps after the first year of subscription. Apple in September also said it was actively cleaning up the App Store, scrutinising it for unwanted apps or those developers indulging in frowned-upon search optimisation practices. Are you an iOS app developer? What do you think of Apple's latest announcement, and the 1,000 codes per app limit? Let us know via the comments section below.

MacBook, MacBook Air or MacBook Pro? Britta O'Boyle31 October 2016Laptops Apple / Pocket-lint Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment Decided you want an Apple laptop, but you're not sure which one is the right one for you? You've come to the right place. With seven MacBook models available before you even consider configuration options, it's not an easy decision, or a simple one. This feature rounds up all the MacBooks models offered through Apple, from the 12-inch MacBook to the new 15-inch MacBook Pro, to help you work out what each model offers, how much they cost, how they can be configured and what their pros and cons are. Read on to find out which Apple MacBook is the one for you. Quick summary The MacBook is the smallest, lightest and most portable MacBook available, but it is also the most restrictive in terms of ports and power. The MacBook Air is the cheapest MacBook available overall, and the lightest option for those after a little more power, larger screen and the convenience of ports. Its screen isn't as impressive as any of the other options but it does offer the longest battery life. The MacBook Pro (2015) 13-inch is the cheapest way to get your hands on the more powerful Pro range of MacBooks, and it offers ports, along with a Retina display. It's larger and heavier than the new Pro models though so less portable than the likes of the Air. The MacBook Pro (2016) 13-inch without Touch Bar is lighter and smaller than the older 13-inch Pro model, while offering more storage as standard and a brighter display. It doesn't offer the Touch Bar or Touch ID, and although it has two Thunderbolt 3 ports instead of a single USB Type-C port like the MacBook, it is still restrictive in the port department. The MacBook Pro (2016) 13-inch with Touch Bar is the model for those who want the power, the new lighter design, Touch Bar and Touch ID functionality, as well as more Thunderbolt 3 ports. It comes at a cost though, with a starting price of £300 more than the model without the Touch Bar. The MacBook Pro (2015) 15-inch is the cheapest way to get your hands on an even larger Pro model, with all the ports still intact and a Retina display. As with the older 13-inch model though, it is larger and heavier than the new Pro models, storage configuration tops out at 1TB and its screen isn't as bright as the new Pros. The MacBook Pro (2016) with Touch Bar is the king of the MacBooks with the best power and largest storage options, biggest screen, new design and the Touch Bar and Touch ID features. It is also the most expensive however and this probably isn't the MacBook you'll want if you're constantly on the move. Apple Apple MacBook Dimensions: 280.5 x 196.5 x 35-131mm, 920g Display: 12-inches, 2304 x 1440 (226ppi), 300nits brightness Connections: One USB Type-C port, 3.5mm headphone jack Battery: 10 hours Price: From £1249 to £1684 The MacBook is the smallest, lightest and most portable of the MacBook family, but it has the smallest display and it's not as powerful as the MacBook Air or any of the MacBook Pro models. The base model features a 1.1GHz Intel Core m3 processor and 256GB of storage, while the highest spec available offers a 1.3GHz Intel Core m7 processor and 512GB of storage. All configurations have Intel HD Graphics 515 and 8GB of RAM. The MacBook only has one USB Type-C port, which supports charging, USB 3.1, Native DisplayPort 1.2 video output, VGA output and HDMI video output. This means it isn't the most convenient MacBook for those that need to connect lots of devices, whether that's a camera, or an adapter to allow for the transfer of images from an SD card. It comes in Rose Gold, Space Grey, Gold and Silver colour options, all of which have a 480p FaceTime camera. Apple MacBook (2016) review: Is port-free still the future? Apple Apple MacBook Air Dimensions: 325 x 227 x 30-170mm, 1.35kg Display: 13.3-inches, 1400 x 900 (125ppi) Connections: Two USB 3 ports, Thunderbolt 2 port, MagSafe power port, SDXC card slot, 3.5mm headphone jack Battery: 12 hours Price: From £949 to £1409 The MacBook Air is the oldest of the MacBook family and although it is no longer the slimmest, it is the lightest MacBook available for those after power and a larger display. It is also the cheapest MacBook and the only one to start under the £1000 mark. The base model has a 1.6GHz Intel Core i5 processor and 128GB of storage, while the top-spec available has a 2.2GHz Intel Core i7 chip and 512GB of storage. All model configurations feature Intel HD Graphics 6000 and 8GB of RAM.  The MacBook Air is a lot more flexible than the MacBook when it comes to ports, meaning you'll not only be able to pop in an SD card to transfer images, but you'll be able to charge your MacBook Air while doing so, or connecting to another device. For some, one port on the MacBook will be enough, for others it will be a pain, which is where the Air steps in. The MacBook Air comes in Silver and it features a 720p FaceTime camera, meaning video calls will be crisper than on the MacBook. Apple MacBook Air 13-inch (2013) review Apple Apple MacBook Pro (2015) Dimensions: 314 x 219 x 180mm, 1.58kg Display: 13.3-inches, 2560 x 1600 (226ppi), 300nits brightness Connections: Two USB 3 ports, two Thunderbolt 2 ports, MagSafe 2 power port, HDMI port, SDXC card slot 3.5mm headphone jack Battery: 10 hours Price: From £1249 to £2419 The MacBook Pro family now consists of five options and last year's 13-inch MacBook Pro is the cheapest in the Pro portfolio. It is heavier and larger than the MacBook, MacBook Air, and the two newer 13-inch MacBook Pros, but it retains those connections, which may come in useful for some. The base model has a 2.7GHz Intel Core i5 processor, 128GB of storage and 8GB of RAM. The top-specced model available has a 3.1GHz Intel Core i7 processor, 1TB of storage and 16GB of RAM. All configurations feature Intel Iris Graphics 6000. Like the MacBook Air, the MacBook Pro (2015) features more flexibility than the MacBook when it comes to ports, as we mentioned. It adds a HDMI port, along with an extra Thunderbolt 2 port to its features in comparison to the MacBook Air. The MacBook Pro (2015) comes in Silver and it has a 720p FaceTime camera, like the MacBook Air. Apple MacBook Pro 13-inch with Retina display (early 2015) review: May the Force be with you Apple MacBook Pro (2016) vs MacBook Pro (2015): What's the difference? Apple Apple MacBook Pro (2016) - Without Touch Bar and Touch ID Dimensions: 304.1 x 212.4 x 149mm, 1.37kg Display: 13.3-inches, 2560 x 1600 (226ppi), 500nits brightness Connections: Two Thunderbolt 3 ports, 3.5mm headphone jack Battery: 10 hours Price: From £1449 to £2439 This year's 13-inch MacBook Pro without the Touch Bar is the model for those who want the power, aren't fussed about the lack of ports and don't want the Touch Bar and Touch ID, or perhaps don't have the budget for them. The base model has a 2.0GHz Intel Core i5 processor, 256GB of storage and 8GB of RAM. The top-of-the-range model has a 2.4GHz Intel Core i7 processor, 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. All configurations have Intel Iris Graphics 540. Like the MacBook, this 13-inch MacBook Pro lacks in the port department, though it does have two Thunderbolt 3 ports over one USB Type-C port, meaning you'll at least be able to charge it, while connecting to another device.  The MacBook Pro (2016) without Touch Bar and Touch ID is available in Silver or Space Gray, comes with a 720p FaceTime camera like last year's MacBook Pro and Air and has two microphones. Apple MacBook Pro (2016) preview: Air apparent Apple MacBook Pro (2016) vs Apple MacBook Air: What's the difference? Apple Apple MacBook Pro (2016) - With Touch Bar and Touch ID Dimensions: 304.1 x 212.4 x 149mm, 1.37kg Display: 13.3-inches, 2560 x 1600 (226ppi), 500nits brightness Connections: Four Thunderbolt 3 ports, 3.5mm headphone jack Battery: 10 hours Price: From £1749 to £2759 This year's 13-inch MacBook Pro with the Touch Bar is for those who want the power and the latest features, but still in a compact and easily portable device. The base model has a 2.9GHz Intel Core i5 processor, 256GB of storage and 8GB of RAM. The top-specced model has a 3.1GHz Intel Core i5 processor, 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. All configurations have Intel Iris Graphics 550. Like the MacBook and MacBook Pro without Touch Bar, this 13-inch MacBook Pro says bye-bye to the ports again. It does however offer more than the previous two models, with four Thunderbolt 3 ports. You'll still need adapters to transfer images from an SD card for example, but the extra ports will allow you to do more simultaneously than you could do with the MacBook especially, but also the MacBook Pro without Touch Bar.

Apple MacBook Pro (2016) with Touch Bar: Thinner, brighter, faster, and very touchy feely Apple Apple MacBook Pro (2015) Dimensions: 358.9 x 247.1 x 180mm, 2.04kg Display: 15.4-inches, 2880 x 1800 (220ppi), 300nits brightness Connections: Two USB 3 ports, two Thunderbolt 2 ports, MagSafe 2 power port, HDMI port, SDXC card slot 3.5mm headphone jack Battery: 9 hours Price: From £1899 to £2709 Last year's 15-inch MacBook Pro the cheaper option for those who want the power, larger screen and the ports, but aren't necessarily as fussed about the latest and greatest features. The base model has a 2.2GHz Intel Core i7 processor and 256GB of storage and 8GB of RAM. The top-specced model available has a 2.8GHz Intel Core i7 processor and 1TB of storage. All configurations feature 16GB of RAM and Intel Iris Pro Graphics. Like the MacBook Pro (2015) 13-inch, the MacBook Pro (2015) 15-inch features more flexibility than the MacBook and new MacBook Pros when it comes to ports, as we mentioned. It adds a HDMI port, along with an extra Thunderbolt 2 port to its features in comparison to the MacBook Air. The MacBook Pro (2015) comes in Silver, has a 720p FaceTime camera, like the MacBook Air and offers two microphones. Apple MacBook Pro (2016) vs MacBook Pro (2015): What's the difference? Apple Apple MacBook Pro (2016) - With Touch Bar and Touch ID Dimensions: 349.3 x 240.7 x 155mm, 1.83kg Display: 15.4-inches, 2880 x 1800 (220ppi), 500nits brightness Connections: Four Thunderbolt 3 ports, 3.5mm headphone jack Battery: 10 hours Price: From £2349 to £4049 The new 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar and Touch ID is MacBook for those after the power, the large screen and the latest and greatest features Apple has to offer. You'll need the budget with this one though.  The base model has a 2.6GHz Intel Core i7 processor, 256GB of storage and Radeon Pro 450 graphics. The top-specced model available has a 2.9GHz Intel Core i7 processor, 2TB of storage and Radeon Pro 460 graphics. All configurations feature 16GB of RAM. As with the 13-inch MacBook Pro (2016), you'll need to make sure you allow for buying any adapters you might need because the ports are limited to just Thunderbolt 3, though you at least get a few extra compared to the MacBook's singular USB Type-C port and the two Thunderbolt 3 ports on the new MacBook Pro without Touch Bar. The MacBook Pro (2016) comes in Silver and Space Grey, has three microphones, and it has a 720p FaceTime camera, like all the other MacBooks, except the 12-inch MacBook.

Tai, who joined Sharp as president in August after Foxconn completed its acquisition of the Japanese tech firm, revealed the news during a speech given to students at Tatung University. "The iPhone has been evolving and now it is switching from LTPS [low-temperature poly-silicon] to OLED panels," he said during a ceremony in which he was awarded an honorary doctorate degree. "We don't know whether Apple's OLED iPhones will be a hit, but if Apple doesn't walk down this path and transform itself, there will be no innovation. It is a crisis but it is also an opportunity.” Tai didn’t say when Apple will make the jump but said: “We are now building a new [OLED] facility in Japan. We can make [OLED panels] in the US too. If our key customer demands [that we] manufacture in the US, is it possible for us not to do so?” Related Stories Apple Is Releasing Only 2 iPhone 8 Models, Source Says 2017 iPhone To Have Wraparound Display This isn’t the first time we’ve heard about Apple considering OLED for the next-generation iPhone, which will arrive as the iPhone 8 rather than the iPhone 7S. The report from Nikkei Asian Review also noted that Apple will most likely create three iPhone variants next year, and only the 5.5-inch model would feature curved OLED screen, with the other two models using the LTPS panels. Reports also claim that the iPhone 8 will be released in September 2017, will be the first Apple smartphone with wireless charging. Bloomberg reported that Apple is “exploring cutting-edge technologies that would allow iPhones and iPads to be powered from further away than the charging mats used with current smartphones.” Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

But the phones themselves would be meaningless without the software that, almost like magic, imbues them with new powers even their creators never thought possible. In that spirit, these are TIME’s 50 best iPhone and Android apps of the year. These are apps that were either released, had a notable redesign, or took off in popularity this year. The list is unranked, as the different functionality of each app makes them impossible to fairly compare. What did we miss? View as 1 of 50 Replay SHARE Venmo Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone and Android, Free It’s rare that a company or an app gets “verbified” the way Google did. That’s exactly what’s happening with money-sending app Venmo, especially among cash-allergic millennials. “Just Venmo me” is an increasingly common refrain at brunch or the bar when it’s time to split the check. Replay SHARE Messages Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone, Free Why include Apple’s default messaging service in this list? Because Messages got a major overhaul in iOS 10, the company’s new iPhone software update. Messages is now a feature-rich messaging platform, complete with third-party apps, stickers, and fun graphic effects like confetti and laser beams. All the new functionality puts it leagues ahead of regular old SMS texting. Replay SHARE Signal Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone and Android, Free Which messaging app should you use when you really want to make sure your chats stay secret? Try Signal, an encrypted chat app used by politicians, businesspeople and whistleblowers worldwide. Signal offers complete end-to-end encryption, meaning the company behind the app can’t see what you’re sending and receiving. And it works with your existing contact book, so long as both parties have Signal installed. Replay SHARE Snapchat Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone and Android, Free Sure, Snapchat first came out in 2011, but it certainly came into its own this year — especially with the app’s “Chat 2.0” revision in March 2016. With that update, the free disappearing video messaging app laid the groundwork for all sorts of killer features, from geofilters to facial lenses. As a result, Snapchat has not only become one of the most fun apps of the year, but it’s turning into a real business, too. Replay SHARE Pokémon Go Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone and Android, Free The super-powered creatures that triggered a worldwide craze in the 90’s have finally reached the smartphone era. Immediately upon launching in July, Pokémon Go became a massive sensation among seemingly anyone who owned a smartphone. The game tasks players with physically exploring the real world to capture new Pokémon creatures, engaging in battles to claim gyms, and collecting items. It also uses your phone’s camera to make it seem like critters from the game are appearing in your actual surroundings. By cleverly using the technology in our smartphones and tapping into a wildly beloved franchise, game developer Niantic created a smash hit. Replay SHARE WhatsApp Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME In the seven years that WhatsApp has existed, it’s become one of the most widely used communication tools in the world. The Facebook-owned app initially gained popularity because it works on most smartphones and provides a cheaper alternative to SMS for sending messages around the globe. After conducting a survey this April that included 187 countries, research firm SimilarWeb found that WhatsApp was the messaging app of choice in 55% of the world. Earlier this year, the company announced that it surpassed the one billion user milestone, meaning one in every seven people in the world now use WhatsApp. Replay SHARE NPR One Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone and Android, Free Unless you drive often, you probably don’t have easy access to an AM/FM radio. Which means it’s hard to find public radio, a great source of news, knowledge and new music. NPR’s new NPR One app can help — it’s basically a customizable public radio station that learns what shows you like and what topics you’re interested in, building a more personal feed over time. You can also use it to listen to NPR podcasts on demand, like Planet Money and the NPR Politics Podcast. Replay SHARE NYT Cooking Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone, Free (web version for Android) Need an easy weekday meal for two? What should you do with all those apples you just picked? How about a slow-cooker recipe? NYT Cooking, from The New York Times, can answer all these questions and more. It offers lots of great recipes searchable by type of meal, prep time and more, often along with beautiful photos. A big bonus: You can save recipes from around the web to this app, making it a clearing house for the meals you’d like to cook. Replay SHARE Spotify Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone, Android (Free With Ads) Even with Apple, Amazon and Google all taking aim, Spotify is still king of the music streaming apps. A big redesign this year brought a more modern interface that’s still dead simple to use, and gorgeous to boot. One of our favorite features is the mood-based playlists, great when you need something for a rainy day or a morning workout. Replay SHARE A Good Snowman Is Hard to Build Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone and Android, $4.99 A puzzle game about crafting people made of snow, rolled into being by a blobby black creature surrounded by tiny gardens of white. Players fashion snowballs from strips of snow by swiping to roll, then stacking them in threes, large-medium-small. Only each garden has constraints, from ornamental bird baths and birdhouses to rows of potted plants. Beautifully visualized and scored, A Good Snowman Is Hard to Build is one of the sweetest, smartest puzzlers to grace 2016. Replay SHARE Prisma Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone and Android, Free Photo editing apps are generally a dime a dozen, all offering slight variations on the same basic features: Film-style filters, crop and resize tools, red eye reduction and so on. Prisma stands out from the pack by using complex algorithms to transform your images into vibrant and unique works of art. A recent update means it can now do the same for video, too. It takes some practice to know which filters will work the best with which photos, but once you nail it, the payoff is sweet. Replay SHARE White Noise Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone, Android (Free With Ads) Getting a newborn to sleep, or even just break out of a crying fit, is no easy feat. White Noise helps by flooding baby with soothing sounds, from “Heavy Rain Pouring” and “Ocean Waves Crashing” to “Extreme Rain Pouring” and “Stream Water Flowing.” It’s easy to switch between sounds and adjust the volume to find the mix that works best for baby. Only one downside: The app doesn’t work in the background if you exit it to work on other things. Best to download it onto one of the old disconnected iPhones sitting in a drawer and make that baby’s iPhone. Replay SHARE bitmoji Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone and Android, Free Why say it with words when you can say it with stickers? Bitmoji lets you create custom emoji-like stickers complete with an avatar that looks just like you. Stickers have been around for years, but they’re really taking off this year — so much so that Snapchat acquired the company behind Bitmoji for about $100 million in March. Replay SHARE Google Translate Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone and Android, Free One of the coolest pieces of fictional Star Trek tech is the Universal Translator, which lets the Enterprise’s crew understand alien languages. The next best thing is Google Translate, which can take typed phrases, spoken words and even real-world text (like street signs) and transform them into other languages. This year’s big update brought more useful features, like tap-to-translate on Android and offline language packs for the iPhone version, helpful when you’re traveling abroad without a data plan. Replay SHARE Breathe Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME Apple Watch, Free Apple’s Breathe app, for the Apple Watch, walks users through a short set of deep breathing exercises. That might sound silly, but spending a few minutes every day to take some deep breaths can have remarkable benefits for your mental health. Our advice: Disable the daily breathe reminders, stressful in their own right, and open the app only when you need it. Replay SHARE Burly Men At Sea Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone and Android, $4.99 Brain&Brain’s folklorish adventure is a whimsical romp starring three bearded adventurers that speaks in plaintive accordion tunes and whispers, airy sighs and polyphonic hoots–one that marries quirky activities with starlit encounters and aquamarine serpents plucked from Norwegian myth. It’s a little bit The Old Man and the Sea, a little bit O Brother, Where Art Thou? And a reminder that every journey is a circle, filled with both farce and delight. Replay SHARE Amazon Alexa Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone and Android, Free Amazon’s Alexa app turns your smartphone into a remote for your Echo Internet-connected speaker, handy for setup and when you’re too far from your Echo for it to pick up your requests. If you’re an Echo fan, this app is a can’t-miss companion. Replay SHARE Quik Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone and Android, Free Modern smartphones can record very high-quality video, but what to do with all that footage? Try Quik, an automatic video editing app that action camera maker GoPro acquired and rebranded this year. Quik takes a bunch of your video footage, identifies the best moments automatically, and sets the whole thing to mood-appropriate music. It’s a great way to add a professional-looking touch to your recordings before putting them on Facebook, YouTube or Instagram. Replay SHARE Mint Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone and Android, Free Mint’s an older app, but it’s still the king of budget management software. Mint connects with your various bank accounts, pulling in your spending and income and organizing it into categories that make it easy to track and stick to a budget. It’s great in those situations when you’re contemplating a big purchase and want to see if you can really afford it or not. Replay SHARE Gboard Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone, Free Google’s Gboard app pulls Google’s powerful search engine into text conversations, making it possible to find answers to questions or seek restaurant suggestions without leaving a chat. Google’s search bar is built right into the keyboard, which pulls up results across sites on the Web, locations in Google Maps, and more. The app launched in May, months before Apple released its dramatic overhaul of iMessage in September that added the ability to interact with outside apps within a text thread. Replay SHARE Day One Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone, $4.99 Keeping and looking back on a journal can be deeply rewarding, but it’s a tough habit to build. Instead try Day One, a journaling app that makes it easy to quickly record a few thoughts, along with a photo, every day. Unlike paper journals, Day One automatically backs up your notes to the cloud, helping preserve your reflections forever. Replay SHARE Crashlands Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone and Android, $4.99 Old school roleplaying games dole out abstract rewards like “experience points” so you can make your superpowers a trifle more super. New school ones like Crashlands let you scoop those rewards up off the battlefield, drag them back to your base, then turn them into cool, usable objects. Killer aliens meets goofball storytelling and characters meets a weighty crafting system brimming with hundreds of recipes, Crashlands is everything predictable RPGs aren’t. Replay SHARE Boomerang Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone and Android, Free Boomerang takes a burst of still photos, then stitches them together in a short, looping video. The end result is somewhere between a GIF and a stop-motion movie. Tons of fun to play around with, Boomerang is Instagram’s best spinoff app. Replay SHARE Google Trips Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone and Android, Free With its new travel app, Google wants to be the only resource you need when planning your next getaway. Trips scans your Gmail inbox for flight and hotel information, pulling it into a one-stop-shop. It also packs itineraries for a handful of cities, including attractions, restaurants and more. These simple travel guides can be downloaded for offline use, great when you’re abroad without a data plan. Replay SHARE Untappd Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone and Android, Free Remember how much fun Foursquare was in its glory days? Well, Untappd is basically Foursquare specifically for beer. It’s great as a sort of “beer journal:” Scanning a bottle or can’s barcode with your smartphone saves it for later, meaning you’ll always be able to remember the name of that new brew you tried last night. Replay SHARE Vevo Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone and Android, Free If you love music videos, you probably know Vevo, which is basically the MTV of the smartphone era. Vevo dropped a big redesign this year featuring a gorgeous interface with your favorite music videos, as well as a discovery feature to help you find rising artists. The app learns your preferences over time, helping to customize your feed. Replay SHARE Alto Mail Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone and Android, Free AOL’s take on gussying up your email service has been around for a few years, but the app’s 2.0 version, launched in September 2016, makes an already smart take on email even smarter. The free app’s new dashboard scrapes all the important information from your emails — shopping receipts, tracking numbers, reservation information, and more — and puts it on virtual cards, for easy gleaning. The app can be used to put a more manageable face on almost any other email service, from IMAP to Gmail, and can also pile up your digital information in “stacks” of photos, files, bills, and other categories. Replay SHARE Houseparty Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone and Android, Free With a user-friendly way to stream video from a mobile phone to everyone in the world, Meerkat turned the Internet on its ear. But that app is so last year (to the point that it’s no longer operational) and in its place Meerkat’s developers have released Houseparty, which is mainstreaming group video chats in almost the same way. Creating what it calls a “synchronous social network,” Houseparty basically lets people video chat with each other, up to eight people at a time. Open the free Android or iOS app, and you’re broadcasting in your own private video chat room. Replay SHARE Netflix’s Fast.com Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME Web app, Free With millions of users sucking down data at home, on mobile and over Wi-Fi, the Internet can be a very slow place. There are dozens of iOS and Android apps to measure your speeds, but they all seem to have an air of unreliability. Fast.com, a web app put out by Netflix, loads quicker than a Craigslist directory on whatever device, whichever operating system, and wherever you are. So from the boardroom, to the bathroom, to the backyard, you’ll always know if you’re down to download. Replay SHARE Nuzzel Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone and Android, Free Launched at the tail end of 2015, this free Android and iOS app is a vital app for keeping pace with Twitter’s endless stream of information. Syncing up with your social networks, Nuzzel keeps track of the most tweeted links by the accounts you follow and provides a roundup of all the associated tweets. Ideal for news hounds or anyone who closely follows trends on the Twitterverse, it’s become a must-use over the past 12 months. Replay SHARE Reddit Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone and Android, Free Unofficial Reddit apps existed before this year, but the official take makes the front page of the Internet even easier to use and browse than it is on a computer. Longtime Redditors may disagree (they’re never short on opinions), but the app’s intuitive interface is good for new users, making it easier to dive into topics and communities. The communications tab pulls messages, comments, replies and mentions into one place for quick access, and the main tab puts the web’s hottest content just taps away. Replay SHARE Sorcery! 4 Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone and Android, $4.99 The fourth and final installment in studio Inkle’s grand game-book series based on Steve Jackson’s Sorcery! adventures is an easy recommend for admirers of plain brilliant storytelling. No, you needn’t have played the first three, though the delights are that much brighter if you have. Want to see what a choose-your-own-adventure meets immaculate illustrations and artistry meets the opposite of tin-eared writing looks like? Start here. Replay SHARE Streaks Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone (with Apple Watch app), $3.99 Bad habits may be hard to break, but good habits can be even harder to make. This app helps by giving users a gentle reminder ever day — whether its on your phone or your wrist — to develop up to six healthy routines. Pre-loaded with all sorts of activities from drinking more water to walking the dog (and with Apple Health integrations), it’ll help you do all the little things consistently and right. Streaks was launched in 2015, but the app was given a slick 2.0 makeover this year that was so good it garnered the app an Apple Design Award. Replay SHARE Tribe Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone and Android, Free There are a slew of Snapchat-like free video messaging apps on the market. And while they all jockey for position, Tribe does so with a new killer feature: Magic Words. Basically, when a user says a term in his or her video (like a band name, for example) that word — through some back-end Google speech recognition magic — appears on the screen, overlaid on the video as a clickable keyword. Is this enough to put it ahead of the camera-toting pack? It’s early to say for sure, but this one’s worth watching. Replay SHARE Google Allo Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone and Android, Free A new messaging app from Google, Allo is one of the first products to incorporate the firm’s new artificially intelligent aide, the Google Assistant. Allo has a few limitations — there aren’t any third-party apps and there’s no desktop companion, for instance. But Allo earns a spot on our list because of the potential of the Google Assistant. Right now, it’s pretty good at handling basic questions and surfacing recommendations within chats. But when and if it gets smarter, it could be truly brilliant. Replay SHARE Microsoft Pix Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone, Free Microsoft is pitching Pix as a replacement for the iPhone’s standard Camera app. Pix, which launched in July, uses artificial intelligence to recognize the subject of an image and adjust camera settings in real time. If you’re snapping a photo in well-lit conditions, it’ll create a GIF-like video loop when it detects motion. Unlike many other photo apps, Pix offers helpful enhancements rather than gimmicky features, all with little effort on the user’s part. Replay SHARE Picniic Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone, Free Picniic is a sort of Swiss Army Knife for keeping your family organized: it’s a shared to-do list, calendar, and event manager all in one. Within the app, users can assign tasks on the to-do list to specific family members and take note of the last time a certain family member was heard from. It’s a bit similar to another app called Cozi, but Picniic offers a few extras, including a newsfeed-style stream of updates and an encrypted storage locker for keeping personal family information. Replay SHARE Swift Playgrounds Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone, Free There are dozens of apps, games, and toys designed to help kids learn the building blocks of computer programming. But few of these apps do so by having players write lines of actual code, as Apple’s Swift Playgrounds does. The iPad app challenges participants to input strings of characters written in Apple’s Swift language to complete puzzles. Aspiring developers can also write their own code in a blank document and export it into Xcode, Apple’s software for creating apps. “We’re not hiding code, or running away from the fact that it is code,” Wiley Hodges, director of tools and technologies product marketing for Apple, previously told TIME about the app. Replay SHARE Pocket Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone and Android, Free When you see an article you want to read but don’t have time at the moment, you can save it to Pocket and savor it later. It downloads articles in a clean, readable format so you can read anything without an Internet connection. Add-ons for desktop browsers mean you can save stories from your work computer and read them on your way home. Replay SHARE Waze Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone and Android, Free Google Maps and Apple Maps are fine, but neither will make you the master of defeating traffic like Waze. Acquired by Google in 2013 for a reported $1.3 billion, Waze collects data about traffic jams, construction and other issues and displays them to other drivers in a given area. It’s also great at finding little-known shortcuts to save you precious minutes, mileage and gas money. Replay SHARE Reigns Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone and Android, $2.99 Swipe left or right, that’s all there is to Reigns, an ingenious, dichotomous Tinder-like, only about ruling a kingdom instead of speed-dating. There are no roads less traveled, only left or right turns, yes or no answers to questions of medieval monarch-dom, as you attempt to balance your kingdom’s needs along idiosyncratic, ever-forking roads. If your idea of choose-your-own nirvana involves minimalist, binary survivalism (your goal is to stay alive), Reigns is one of the coolest stripped-down, rapid-play angles on the genre in years. Replay SHARE Super Stickman Golf 3 Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone and Android, Free Golf and stickmen? Really? Unqualifiedly. It’s the adventurist allure of putt-putt, the ballistic physics of Angry Birds and the zany level design of 2D platformers like Super Mario Bros. rolled into one. After two forays to hone their ingenious little mashup, this is the iteration of Noodlecake Studios’ series to own, the one that brings it all together while adding the option to put English on the ball. Even if like me the thought of playing real golf makes you recoil, this is the stick-and-ball-swatting game for you. Replay SHARE Bandsintown Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone and Android, Free Ah, the time-old question: “Any good bands in town tonight?” Get your answer with Bandsintown, which analyzes your music listening habits and alerts you when your favorite performers are in your area. There’s also a calendar display that lets you check out who’s playing on a given date in case you’d prefer to check out something new for a change. Replay SHARE Insight Timer Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone and Android, Free Do away with the the stressful blare of your built-in phone buzzer. Insight Timer is really nothing more than a peaceful chime when time’s up, but we find ourselves using it for everything from signaling the end of a meditation session to the completion of roast chicken. Anything’s better than hearing Marimba for the millionth time. Replay SHARE Calorie Counter Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone and Android, Free It’s never easy to count calories, but MyFitnessPal’s Calorie Counter can be a handy helper. Just tell it what you’ve eaten in a given day, and it’ll let you know how many calories you’ve consumed. Tracking that data is an important part of losing weight, which, when it comes down to it, is about burning more calories than you’ve taken in. Replay SHARE Warbits Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone, $3.99 Okay, sure, Warbits clearly cribs from classic turn-based strategy game Advance Wars (for Nintendo’s ancient Game Boy Advance, no less). But I can think of no higher praise to lavish on a game that fills a void over a decade wide and generations of overlooked platforms deep. Much more than a clone, Warbits takes the idea that teams of infantry, armor and aerial vehicles are squaring off over moderately sized squarish maps, then adds an online mode that’s pretty much the definition of how to do turn-based, 1v1 or 2v2 strategy on a phone. Replay SHARE Hitlist Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone, Free There are incredible airfare deals available and dozens of places we’d love to visit. But finding a reasonable deal takes far more time and effort than it should. Hitlist can help. It combines travel photography with airfare deals, letting you add appealing destinations to your watch list. Then you’ll get alerts when there’s an incredible price on flights. Replay SHARE Beam Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone and Android, Free Video game streaming apps like the Amazon-owned Twitch are getting extremely popular — Twitch users watched more than 241 billion minutes of content last year. So it’s not surprising to see younger companies getting in on the action. One of the newbies is Beam, which offers the unique twist of letting viewers impact the game. Audiences on Beam can suggest moves for players, give them challenges, and more. Microsoft acquired the company behind beam in August; it’s now integrating it directly into the Xbox platform. Replay SHARE _PRISM Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone and Android, $2.99 Prism has one of those un-self-aware taglines about “sacred geometry” converging with “the ethereal soul” you can just ignore, then get right to the heart of the matter: It’s a stirring, smart little shape-puzzler set to groovy, hypnotic tunes. Lines and dots you manipulate with your finger adorn shapes that unfurl like polyhedral flowers as you advance, uncloaking incandescent cores. The puzzles are diverting but accessible, ensuring you’ll hang around long enough to appreciate the experience’s gorgeous, trippy ambience. Replay SHARE Meditation Studio Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone, $3.99 A well-designed gateway app to a serious daily meditation practice. Great for beginners, the app has more than 200 guided meditations of varying lengths organized around whatever you need—sleep, confidence, stress and anxiety relief—and it gives you a perfect little zen break wherever you are.

Apple Discontinuing MacBook Startup Chime Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Apple Discontinuing MacBook Startup Chime Image courtesy of GeoffMyers.com October 31, 2016 9:45 am EST By Ashlee Kieler@akieler No chimes for you macbook apple startup sounds chime Making Changes One of the most instantly recognizable sounds in electronics may be about to go the way of “You’ve Got Mail,” as Apple is reportedly doing away with it signature startup sound on its Mac computers. Business Insider, citing blog Pingie.com, reports that the single note chime did not migrate to Apple’s newest MacBook Pro announced last week. The chime-less startup is likely the result of the way the new MacBooks turn on: with no power button, the computer simply starts anytime the cover is lifted. Additionally, a FAQ page for the older Macs indicated that the “startup sound” was a way to reset a computer’s non-volatile random-access memory. A mention of the chime sound is not included in the new MacBook FAQ page. Pingie.com writer Dan, who owns one of the new laptops, points out that the writing was on the wall for the chime’s discontinuation, as Apple’s newest products, including the iPhone, don’t have startup sounds. Still, Business Insider notes that the chime had been a part of Apple’s computers for almost as long as Apple has made computers: the tones began singing from devices in the 1980s, and were reconfigured to today’s chime in 1998 with the iMac G3. Here’s the sounds all Mac users will be missing (if they buy the new MacBook): And for a trip down memory lane, here are the different variations of Apple’s startup chime through the years: Apple Says Goodbye To The Startup Chime with the New MacBook Pro [Pingie.com] Apple is killing off its iconic startup chime [Business Insider] October 31, 2016 By Ashlee Kieler@akieler No chimes for you macbook apple startup sounds chime Making Changes Tell a friend: Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Related no camping Apple Retail Chief: The Days Of Waiting In Line At The Store Are Over mbp2011 Thousands Of MacBooks Made In 2011 Have Self-Immolating Graphics Cards time for a makeover Apple Might Be Planning First Big Update To MacBook Pro Laptops In 4 Years big data is watching Apple Wants To Pre-Check Your Spending Power Before Advertising To You too good to be true Startup Promising Cash For Weddings Pivots To Crowdfunding Platform, Infuriates Couples Previous Luxury Retailers Offering Fewer Handbag Choices This Holiday Season Amid Lack Of Demand Next CenturyLink Snapping Up Level 3 For $34 Billion To Make Internet Service Voltron Part of  Founded in 2005, Consumerist is an independent source of consumer news and information published by Consumer Media LLC, a not-for-profit subsidiary of Consumer Reports.

Ukrainian man renames himself ‘iPhone 7’ to win one of Apple’s new handsets October 31, 2016 0 187 Author: Daily mail UK Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter tweet A young man shows his passport giving his name as iPhone Sim (seven), and a new iPhone 7 in an electronics shop in Kiev, Ukraine, Friday, Oct. 28, 2016. A A computer company in Kiev announced that it will give a new iPhone 7 to anybody who officially changes their name to iPhone Seven. (AP Photo/Efrem Lukatsky) A Ukrainian man officially changed his name to ‘iPhone 7’ to win the phone  Electronics store offered the latest Apple product to the first five people  The price of phone starts at US $850 in Ukraine, while name change is $2 He said he might change his name back eventually, when he has children A Ukrainian man has officially changed his name to ‘iPhone 7’ after an electronics store offered the latest Apple product to the first five people to do that. The 20-year old was awarded the coveted prize on Friday. He said he might change his name back to Olexander Turin when he has children. The price of phone starts at US $850 (£697) in Ukraine, while the name changes costs the equivalent of $2 (£1.64). His friends and family were shocked at first but eventually supported the idea. His sister, Tetyana Panina, said ‘it was difficult to accept that and hard to believe it’s true.’ She added: ‘Each person in this world is looking for a way to express himself. Why not to do that in this way?’ Apple is set to launch three versions of the iPhone 8 next year, including a new 5-inch handset, it was claimed last week. The firm is expected to unveil the most radical redesign yet of its flagship handset for the iPhone’s 10th anniversary in 2017. According to Nikkei, there will be one premium model with a curved edge-to-edge OLED display alongside two models that have standard LCD displays. Citing a supply chain source, Nikkei said Apple will release the three iPhones in the following screen sizes: 5.5 inches, 5 inches, and 4.7 inches. The 12-megapixel wide-angle camera on both the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus (pictured) includes optical image stabilisation, a larger ƒ/1.8 aperture and new 6-element lens, designed for taking brighter, more detail pictures Apple killed the headphone jack and its next victim could be the home button. A recent patent describes a special lens behind the screen that scans fingerprints anywhere on the surface ‘Apple has tentatively decided that all the 5.5-inch, 5-inch and 4.7-inch models will have glass backs, departing from metal casings adopted by current iPhones, and Biel and Lens are likely to be providing all the glass backs for the new iPhones next year,’ the source said. All three iPhone 8 models will use glass supplied by Biel Crystal Manufactory and Lens Technology in China for both the front and back, which will be held together with an aluminum frame. Along with an edge-to-edge display that includes built-in Touch ID and other sensors, the device is said to include no Home button, advanced biometric features, an improved Taptic engine, and wireless charging. A newly awarded patent describes technology that is capable of scanning fingerprints almost anywhere on the screen of an iOS device – making the home button obsolete. The latest application suggests using a special lens behind the display that connects the screen and sensors, allowing the device to capture an accurate print reading.  SOURCEDaily Mail TAGS I phone 7 SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articlePDP: OVERCOMING LEGAL HURDLES AND THE PROSPECTS OF VICTORY IN ONDO GUBERNATORIAL ELECTION Next articleTimi TNC Reporter RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR Changing narratives: Beyond other rooms for African women Ebonyi: EFCC’s Futile Misadventure vs Governor Umahi’s Financial Wizardry and Prudence $175m reportedly found in the account of a company linked to Patience Jonathan LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply NC Girl FUNMI Date: November 14, 2016 The Nordic Villa A peaceful and safe environment suited for both business and leisure travelers.

Apple TV developers are finally seeing the living room device as a viable platform for app development. There are now more than 8,000 Apple TV apps available, representing growth of around 700% from the 1,000 apps reported over the same period last year, according to comments made by Apple CEO Tim Cook last Thursday. And although that's still a drop in the ocean compared with the more than 2 million smartphone apps available, this remarkable growth is a boon for the new platform, which has been suffering from user engagement issues. Apple also unveiled a new Apple TV app, called TV, aimed at helping users better navigate Apple TV content.  Apple tvOS developers are struggling to keep users engaged, according to mobile analytics firm Adjust. The analysis of almost 300,000 app users, of which 2% are active Apple TV users, found the following: Just 9% of users return to Apple TV apps seven days after download. The retention rate for Apple TV apps gets worse after a month, plummeting to just 4% of users. For context, nearly 20% of iPad users and 18.5% of iPhone users return to an app within seven days. Aside from discovery issues, low engagement rates may be a result of the passive nature of the Apple TV experience. That is, the content viewed on TVs typically includes videos, pictures, and streaming TV, notes TechCrunch. Still, the Apple TV is a relatively new platform, giving the company time to introduce new ways to make it a much more engaging experience for users, in turn increasing its value for developers. The introduction of Apple's new TV app is one way the company is working to do this. But if Apple TV does truly take off, then where would it fit in the future of the television landscape? Over the last few years, there’s been much talk about the “death of TV.” However, television is not dying so much as it's evolving: extending beyond the traditional television screen and broadening to include programming from new sources accessed in new ways. It's strikingly evident that more consumers are shifting their media time away from live TV, while opting for services that allow them to watch what they want, when they want. Indeed, we are seeing a migration toward original digital video such as YouTube Originals, SVOD services such as Netflix, and live streaming on social platforms. However, not all is lost for legacy media companies. Amid this rapidly shifting TV landscape, traditional media companies are making moves across a number of different fronts — trying out new distribution channels, creating new types of programming aimed at a mobile-first audience, and partnering with innovate digital media companies. In addition, cable providers have begun offering alternatives for consumers who may no longer be willing to pay for a full TV package. Dylan Mortensen, senior research analyst for BI Intelligence, has compiled a detailed report on the future of TV that looks at how TV viewer, subscriber, and advertising trends are shifting, and where and what audiences are watching as they turn away from traditional TV.  Here are some key points from the report: Increased competition from digital services like Netflix and Hulu as well as new hardware to access content are shifting consumers' attention away from live TV programming. Across the board, the numbers for live TV are bad. US adults are watching traditional TV on average 18 minutes fewer per day versus two years ago, a drop of 6%. In keeping with this, cable subscriptions are down, and TV ad revenue is stagnant. People are consuming more media content than ever before, but how they're doing so is changing. Half of US TV households now subscribe to SVOD services, like Netflix, Amazon, and Hulu, and viewing of original digital video content is on the rise. Legacy TV companies are recognizing these shifts and beginning to pivot their business models to keep pace with the changes. They are launching branded apps and sites to move their programming beyond the TV glass, distributing on social platforms to reach massive, young audiences, and forming partnerships with digital media brands to create new content. The TV ad industry is also taking a cue from digital. Programmatic TV ad buying represented just 4% (or $2.5 billion) of US TV ad budgets in 2015 but is expected to grow to 17% ($10 billion) by 2019. Meanwhile, networks are also developing branded TV content, similar to publishers' push into sponsored content. In full, the report:  Outlines the shift in consumer viewing habits, specifically the younger generation. Explores the rise of subscription streaming services and the importance of original digital video content. Breaks down ways in which legacy media companies are shifting their content and advertising strategies. And Discusses new technology that will more effectively measure audiences across screens and platforms.  Interested in getting the full report?

Skip to main content Toggle navigation Dowser Windows Errors Fixes and Guides DLLs How to bring MagSafe back to the new MacBook Pro October 31, 2016October 31, 2016 Lidia S. News Apple decided to scrap MagSafe on the new MacBook Pro, but a custom built MagSafe 2 has got your back! BreakSafe, a custom solution from Griffin, is the successor to MagSafe. Apple’s extreme attention to the tiniest details is one of its greatest strengths and this is what makes its users feel cared for to their greatest comfort. One of these brilliant and small, but incredibly innovative features, which makes every Mac user’s life easier, is the MagSafe. This is a tiny magnetic charging connector, which is strong enough to hold on and charge your device, but actually weak enough to safely unplug and prevent your MacBook from the possibility of getting yanked on the floor if someone manages to trip on its cable. However, in its latest MacBooks, Apple seems to be killing this amazing and convenient feature and replacing it with a standard Thunderbolt 3 connector. Indeed, the open USB-C standard gives the opportunity to charge, relay video and transfer data all through the same port, however, many users find the decision of Apple to eliminate MagSafe as a step backward from the users’ comfort. With MacBook Pro, Apple’s MagSafe is officially dead! Fortunately, there is a solution that may replace MagSafe in the new MacBooks – Griffin now offers BreakSafe, a $34,99 magnetic USB-C cable that does almost the same job as MagSafe. Of course, it is not as convenient as the original, and the look of your MacBook may suffer a bit, since you need to plug in a separate brick that connects through USB-C. Also, you will have to check if you are connected it the right way every time, because it is not reversible like the original MagSafe. However, it can still effectively prevent your new MacBook Pro from falling on the floor and shattering into pieces should you accidentally tug the cable, so it is probably worth the investment. The devil is in the details.

Jonny Wednesday, October 26, 2016 - 10:30 am · Reply And still higher than it was a month ago. macnificentseven48 Wednesday, October 26, 2016 - 11:04 am · Reply Every quarter after Apple is completely embarrased by FANG’s tremendous share gains, Tim Cook comes out and says things will look a lot better NEXT quarter and how his dream is intact. This quarter is no different. It’s like the story of the boy who cried ‘wolf’ one too many times. Tim Cook’s excuses are getting old and absolutely no one believes he’s telling the truth. Even Microsoft is making Apple look pathetic as investors happily pay twice as much for Microsoft stock as they’d pay for Apple. Apple is nothing but a joke on Wall Street. The little engine that could and now it can’t. The 800 lb. gorilla turned into a capuchin monkey. Very, very disappointing for loyal Apple shareholders. KingMel Wednesday, October 26, 2016 - 4:23 pm · Reply Some people have more patience than others. Karma (and reality) took a bite out of Samsung . Sooner or later it will bite speculators who chase growth or potential profits over a profit machine like Apple. Fiscal year 2016 was actually quite good for Apple. Apple’s recent performance is only “disappointing” in comparison to the revenues and profits generated by the massive iPhone 6 surge. The iPhone 7 will generate a similar, but smaller bump relative to the iPhone 6s. And I expect to see a reasonable surge in Mac sales as the new models are released. Those bumps will be quite modest relative to the 37% iPhone 6 surge, but they will help maintain Apple’s long term growth trend. Birdseed Wednesday, October 26, 2016 - 10:02 am · Reply Analysts on the conference call asked Cook about how is it possible that Apple has been spending MORE on R & D and at the same time, sales continue to fall. Tim Cook stuttered, hemmed and hawed, and evaded the question. No wonder investors are punishing Apple today HARD. One day Apple’s board will get the message and recognize Tim Cook for the hapless sock puppet of a CEO that he truly is. For Apple’s sake that day can’t come soon enough. macnificentseven48 Wednesday, October 26, 2016 - 10:33 am · Reply Massive R&D doesn’t pan out for all companies in terms of revenue or profits. I don’t think there are any guarantees at all. Some companies just get lucky. I keep thinking back at Xerox when they had all those cool things developed at PARC and no one at corporate headquarters even recognized what they had. If it didn’t relate to a copier, it might as well be non-existent. Steve Jobs was able to recognize it and used it at Apple. KingMel Wednesday, October 26, 2016 - 1:18 pm · Reply Exactly! Analysts are overly enamored with large R&D budgets. Many companies used to outspend Apple in R&D, but look what happened in the 2000s…OS X, iPod, iPhone, iPad, etc. Apple accomplished far more with far less investment. Analysts are also overly enamored with massive mergers and acquisitions. But I would far rather have Apples’s retained profits “gathering dust” than seeing them wasted on large, high risk acquisitions. Few of them pay off. Apple is better off building its capabilities from the ground up with smaller acquisitions, as appropriate. Apple did not advance to its current state of preeminence by listening th Wall Street and analysts. yojimbo007 Wednesday, October 26, 2016 - 3:02 pm · Reply Massive R&D yes. Where are the Massive results of jaw droping ideas and products? Well Balanced Thursday, October 27, 2016 - 12:52 am · Reply In this day an age of instant gratification Apple should be given the benefit of the doubt. Look at the ghost companies of technology like RCA, Sony, Toshiba, Motorolla, Blackberry etc. They failed to innovate and are out of business or are shells of what they used to be. Look at the ones that innovate too quickly like Samsung: Their mobile unit managed an anemic 100 billion won in operating profit, down from 2.4 trillion won in the year ago quarter. That’s a culling. Most of us tech minded people want the next thing NOW because it’s in our blood, and so it seems Apple is resting on their laurels. Others see their innovation as refinement at a well-balanced pace, which doesn’t jeopardize their customers’ safety. As a result, they continue to sell millions and millions of devices to very satisfied customers. Larry Tate Monday, October 31, 2016 - 9:41 am · Reply Growth rate was 8% compounded annually since the 5S last quarter, so Apple is still growing, and since smartphones probably didn’t grow 8% last year, Apple is taking share. They should only be getting more market share as we speak given Samsung brand dragged thru poop. Also have to laugh at all the “buy American” men who refuse to own a Toyota Truck in spite of massive superiority to US trucks, but have an Android and speaking badly of America’s #1 company. What a joke those guys are. iOS is superior in every way, and next year’s WWDC will prove this, as Apple will roll out their cloud platform to end all cloud platforms. They properly started from the ground up, with Swift the world’s best programming language which is now in a good enough state to allow enterprise/server-side apps to be developed, and will only get stronger as the younger generations take the developer reigns. Apple will continue “up-stack” on developer and cloud, and this will be the nail in the coffin for Android which is already a nightmare for developers and corporate budgets as we speak thanks to awful fragmentation problem. https://www.cnet.com/news/hiroshi-lockheimer-android-google-alphabet/ Add Your Feedback Name (required) Email (required) Web cancel reply Notify me of new comments via email.

Friday, September 30, 2016 · 10:58 am · 35 Comments “If you’ve been using Apple products for a while, you may have multiple Apple IDs. One might be a user name, and another an email address,” Kirk McElhearn writes for Macworld. “Or you may have set up one Apple ID for the iTunes and App Stores and another for your personal data, such as your email and other iCloud services. (And this is fine; Apple even explains how to do it.)” “Some people may have set up a second Apple ID because, for some reason, they couldn’t access the account with the first one, and simply gave up. Or they used an email address they no longer use, and created a new Apple ID with a more current address,” McElhearn writes. “In either of these cases, they cannot download apps or media purchased with the older Apple ID.” “Back in 2013, I wrote about problems with Apple IDs. One of the issues I mentioned was the merging of multiple Apple IDs, and I pointed out that Tim Cook had replied to a user by email, back in 2011, that Apple was working on this,” McElhearn writes. “Five years later, there is still no way to merge Apple IDs. Is it too hard to set up a website where people can enter multiple Apple IDs and passwords and have them linked into one?” Read more in the full article here. MacDailyNews Take: ‘Tis a damn good thing Apple has never announced the ability to merge/manage Apple IDs or the shock of it might have triggered concurrent heart attacks and we’d be dead right now. Is it too hard to set up a website where people can enter multiple Apple IDs and passwords and have them linked into one? (No. It isn’t.) Maybe we should all ask tcook@apple.com that very question?

You’d probably have to decrypt and re-encrypt one of them. listcatcher Friday, September 30, 2016 - 11:24 am · Reply Yes, the problem is obviously not in coming up with “a website where people can enter multiple Apple IDs”. It’s the back end and dealing with all the consequences and permutations and edge cases. listcatcher Friday, September 30, 2016 - 11:29 am · Reply And of course fraud. With this tool, discovering someone’s password means completely hijacking their account. The victim’s account is suddenly just gone. Non-existent. And all their purchases belong to the thief, including, for instance, any unused gift cards or account balance. Predrag Friday, September 30, 2016 - 11:50 am · Reply How is that dependent on (or even related to) multiple IDs??? Whether you have one or more IDs, when someone discovers your password, whatever you have there is compromised. Having other IDs doesn’t save you from losing your data on the account with compromised password. Krioni Friday, September 30, 2016 - 2:25 pm · Reply Did anyone (including Predrag) read what list catcher said? With a merge function, you don’t just have to recover exclusive access to your account. Your account is _gone_. Predrag Friday, September 30, 2016 - 2:31 pm · Reply Maybe I’m slow today, but I can’t make sense of what you (and, presumably, listcatcher) are saying. Exactly HOW is the account _gone_? I can’t see how the availability of this tool (which would allow you to merge multiple Apple IDs) would in any way affect a user whose Apple ID password has been compromised. listcatcher Friday, September 30, 2016 - 2:58 pm · Reply It’s gone because it got merged into the thief’s account. They could hardly allow merging and at the same time maintain that ID as a separate entity. castelbuono Friday, September 30, 2016 - 4:35 pm · Reply Safeguards could/should be built-in to the process to block that very action from occurring. Is anyone can do it, Apple can. Predrag Friday, September 30, 2016 - 5:25 pm · Reply How can it be merged into a thief’s account? What kind of process the merging would have to be in order to allow thief to merge the entire Apple ID with just a password? mike Friday, September 30, 2016 - 1:31 pm · Reply That’s true, but I suspect that my own family’s case is the common one. My wife and I each have two Apple IDs, one which we used for iTunes/App Store purchases in the pre-iCloud era, and another that we use for iCloud features. In that case it should be easy to merge accounts. One account would be set as the “true” iCloud account, and all of its iCloud-related settings and documents would be retained as is. The other account would basically be wiped, but the purchases (i.e. licenses) associated with that account would be migrated to the true account. No file merges would be necessary. The biggest problem is that inexperienced users might accidentally erase the wrong account. In that case, Apple should retain the old account’s files for some period of time (e.g. 6 months) so that the original account can be restored in case of an error. Larry Tate Monday, October 31, 2016 - 9:50 am · Reply This would be WAY too logical for Apple. And while you’re at it dumkopfs, how about making it so I can change the iMac administrator name. I’m so goddam confused with family sharing, multiple iCloud and itunes and App Store accounts, and the admins and names and users on my computers that it makes my head hurt. Meanwhile, you glide over to Netflix and everything is handled seamlessly; Christ, even my rarely-visiting mother-in-law has her own Netflix profile on our TV. And for GOD SAKES, put all the music I’ve purchased thru Apple into the cloud for free. Wanna charge me a nickel or something to redownload a song to some non-Apple device, or recover it after my main storage computer burns down, fine. But it’s QUITE irritating to have music spread all over the goddam place amongst 4 people in my family, when the only person paying for all that music is ONE credit card (MINE). I’m sick and tired of Hollywood and Music Shitistry nickel and diming me my entire life. Screw them. Apple should just make it easier for cord-cutters and say FU hollywood, it’s not like they are playing nice anyway, so F’em and go end-around. When the world starts getting their music the EASY way, they’ll come around and stop trying to squeeze everyone. fred747 Monday, October 3, 2016 - 9:32 pm · Reply Encryption doesn’t seem like a problem that I can see. What might be a problem is Apple doesn’t want to see a secondary market emerging for buying used apple IDs with attached apps. People would buy expensive games on a brand new apple id, then on-sell it. Jim Friday, September 30, 2016 - 11:22 am · Reply Apple’s whole iCloud/Apple ID system is a bag of hurt. Birdseed Friday, September 30, 2016 - 11:25 am · Reply Apple should be embarrassed by this situation. They aren’t, but they should be. ken1w Friday, September 30, 2016 - 11:28 am · Reply The work-around is to enable Family Sharing. Set up the “family of one” in System Preferences iCloud pane, using your main Apple ID. Enter other Apple ID(s) as the “family.” There are some limitations, but purchases can be shared. solid Friday, September 30, 2016 - 12:46 pm · Reply Is there a way to enable multiple credit cards in family sharing that is purchase dependent? I enabled family sharing for Apple Music, but then my grown kids order an iTunes movie rental and I get charged for it on my credit card. I don’t wanna get charged for it. ken1w Friday, September 30, 2016 - 1:16 pm · Reply They should have their own payment method set up for their Apple IDs. Predrag Friday, September 30, 2016 - 2:20 pm · Reply That won’t work. There is no way family members can pay for their own rentals/purchases with their own payment method. This is one of the family plan restrictions that is put in place on purpose, so that people wouldn’t simply get family plan for Apple Music and then share it with their friends to split the cost. There IS a way you could work around this problem. You would need to buy an Apple Store (or iTunes) gift card and redeem it as a family member. Then you could use the balance on that gift card for purchases / rentals, instead of the family head’s credit card. solid Friday, September 30, 2016 - 2:43 pm · Reply I think you are correct Predrag. At least as far as iTunes/Apple Music is concerned. Now my son just purchased an iPhone 7 under his Apple ID and his credit card, so at least Apple Online Store alternate payment methods are allowed.

Backlash Friday, September 30, 2016 - 1:05 pm · Reply Got my Apple ID 10+ years ago, for free. That’s the one I’ve purchased every thing with. Then apple decides to make mobile me FREE and automatically assign you an Apple ID different from the Apple ID you already have. And you can’t merge them, so I have two apple id’s. (as do MANY) one for my purchases and one for everything else. Apple won’t allow you to merge them, can’t add the mobile me email to the old one, or vise versa. Apple needs to allow people to merge them, Hell make it you have to come in to an Apple Store and show ID. botvinnik✓ᵀᴿᵁᴹᴾ Friday, September 30, 2016 - 1:06 pm · Reply really? My MobileMe login was the same AppleID as always…back in the day. I really liked their Gallery service and iWeb. Gollum Friday, September 30, 2016 - 8:18 pm · Reply Exactly. Those who have 10 year old Apple IDs like botvinnok, had paid for @mac.com accounts. So they got away with keeping it and being compatible with iCloud. But the rest of us who didn’t, but had Apple IDs with no email, were not aloud to convert them to @me.com or @iCloud.com accounts. We have to use outside email services, which poses other security risks. And then to use all iCloud services have to make a separate iCloud account. This is the merger we speak of. An iCloud account with no assets merged with an Apple ID, with assets, but unable to function with full iCloud features. Grumpy Friday, September 30, 2016 - 12:00 pm · Reply Exactly! Well stated MDN! The current system is a BIG BAG OF HURT! AAPLfanboy Friday, September 30, 2016 - 12:31 pm · Reply The system is fine as it is and is SECURE. Start messing with it and there would be multiple problems. Tod Friday, September 30, 2016 - 8:46 pm · Reply While I agree with the arguments regarding security an potential DRM issues, there is a class of user who created accounts using a non-Apple email address, typically through their ISP. These users then lost their purchased products when, for various reasons, had to obtain a new email address (moving to an area with a different service provider, for instance). These users had no choice in the matter of losing use of a particular email address and Apple will absolutely not help them transfer their paid-for purchases to a new email account. I know as this happened to me and as a result I’ve lost the ability to update ~$500 worth of apps on both the MAS and the iOS store. Sure, I can still use most of them but as new OS’s are released and apps get updated to use new OS features, I am left behind unless I buy a new copy. I’ve spent a lot of time on tbe phone with support and the bottom line is, “Tough shit, fella.” Spikester Friday, September 30, 2016 - 12:44 pm · Reply I have two IDs in two different countries because I emigrated to Canada. I have no illusions about ever merging these two IDs, I just wish that switching back and forth to keep apps updated wasn’t such a bag of hurt. I’ve managed to minimize the pain by managing everything through iTunes on my Mac and syncing my devices over USB. No over-the-air downloads, purchases, updates, or backups under any circumstances. PatchyThePirate Friday, September 30, 2016 - 1:09 pm · Reply Thanks for shedding light on this MDN. This is fucking absurd. Basically Apple is punishing people who create an Apple ID. I originally used gmail a long long time ago as my iTunes (and now App Store AND Apple Music) ID, and I was not able to merge that account when I created my new @me Apple ID (which is a REQUIREMENT to enable certain services, like full iCloud syncing). So now my Apple world is completely split between my old ID and my Apple ID and there’s nothing I can do about it. It’s incredibly frustrating. They’ve been aware of this issue and had over half a decade to figure this out. But Apple has just chosen neglect. PatchyThePirate Friday, September 30, 2016 - 1:15 pm · Reply It just occurred to me that this is yet ANOTHER sloppy implementation under Eddie Cue’s purview.

The outer facade of the main building is now almost complete, along with around half the solar panels on the roof, with far fewer cranes now operating. The team has also been busy on the landscaping front, with lots of new trees throughout the site. The maintenance facility is growing, construction of a new security building is underway on the Tantau Avenue side of the campus and the main parking garages look pretty much complete – with 300 charging stations for all those Teslas Apple employees favor … The underground auditorium for future Apple keynotes is slowly being covered in dirt and foam, and in the open ground in the centre of the main ring we can see preparation underway for a garden, lake and outdoor dining area. When completed, the lake will be surrounded by trees native to the area. Matthew Roberts’ video focuses on highlighting the changes seen over time, while Duncan Sinfield’s version contains facts and figures. The main spaceship building, for example, is 57 feet tall at the outer edge, rising to 75 feet in the centre. We also learn that while Apple tried to buy all the nearby apartments, negotiations failed. It has managed to buy most of them, with permission granted to demolish the existing units and build three times as many, with Apple employees likely to be bidding for them. Here’s a recent shot showing where the property backs against the campus: Last we noted that Apple recently started preparing for finishing touches on the site as it extended the construction schedule into 2017. The company plans to wrap up landscaping work by the second quarter of next year, while the building construction timeline gets extended three months to the end of 2016. As always, you can follow along with construction progress in our timeline. Below are the two videos, both of which are shot in 4K. Our thanks to both Matthew and Duncan for sharing them.

Alongside its innovative Touch Bar and Touch ID, Apple's latest laptop also packs in a larger trackpad, better speakers and far faster performance than its predecessor. But among the new features, Apple also removed two iconic features that we’ve come to associate with pretty much every MacBook and MacBook Pro . From the outside, one of those is obvious. For years, a glowing Apple logo has been a hallmark of every MacBook, but it's gone on the MacBook Pro . The new 12-inch MacBook is the only other laptop in Apple's range without a glowing logo, so its removal could have something to do with the introduction of new screen technology. Read More Apple has unveiled its new MacBook Pro with 'Touch Bar' and everyone is asking the same question Second, and somewhat less obviously, Apple has also done away with the startup chime on the new MacBook Pro – and that's because it boots up as soon as it's opened. The familiar "bong" sound has been a feature of both desktop and laptop Apple Macs for over 30 years, indicating that the computer has finished its initial diagnostic tests successfully and is starting up. While the disappearance of those two features is quite sad, it gives us an interesting insight into how Apple views its products.

Samsung, LG (and Possibly Sharp) Battle to Become iPhone 8 OLED Supplier GO Total number of displays ordered could exceed 100 million Oct 31, 2016 13:37 GMT  ·  By Andrei Vlad  ·  Share:  Samsung, LG and Sharp are among the largest display suppliers in the smartphone industry, but a large percent of their production is focusing on panels for iPhones. Apple is the most important customer for these display suppliers, which sparks a bit of a rivalry between them. In fact, it appears that Samsung and LG are now fully engaged in a war to obtain from Apple as many OLED orders as possible. Sharp, the underdog in this battle, has already suggested that Apple plans to switch to OLED panels for the next-generation iPhone. Now LG Display made a huge investment in flexible OLED panels throughout the year, increasing its facility and retooling half of it specifically for the production of this type of display. The total amount of money LG Display poured into its facilities to ramp up production of flexible OLED panels next year reached $1.75 billion US dollars. On the other hand, Samsung Display has reportedly invested 5.15 billion US dollars in facilities from the beginning of this year to Q3, the additional investment will raise Samsung's total investment in OLEDs of this yer to around 9.7 billion US dollars. So, basically, LG and Samsung have invested in their display divisions around 11.45 billion US dollars for flexible OLED panels, and that's just this year alone. That's how much these companies treasure Apple as a customer. iPhone 8 concept (camera) Since Apple usually sells around 200 million iPhones every year, even if just half of these iPhones use OLED panels, the Cupertino-based company will need to order 100 million OLED panels each year. Sources in the industry claim that Samsung Display might receive all orders for OLEDs for the iPhone 8, but we doubt LG Display and Sharp's panels division won't receive any contracts. On a side note, display industry predicts that OLED panels will overpass the half of total displays for the iPhone starting 2018, which translates into even more orders that LG, Samsung and Sharp might need to fulfill.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (2 Images) #iPhone 8#OLED panel#Samsung Display#LG Display#iPhone 8 display subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Photo Gallery (2 Images) 01 02 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news iPhone 8 Concept Imagines 4mm Thin Body, OLED Display - Video Next-Generation iPhone Could Pack OLED Display, Sharp CEO Claims Despite Rumors, Apple Might Not Launch a 5-Inch iPhone 8 Version in 2017 Apple Could Launch a 5.0-inch iPhone 8, Report Claims OnePlus 4 Rumors Suggest Mind-Blowing Specs: 8GB RAM, Snapdragon 835 CPU Pregnant Woman Suffers Second-Degree Burns After Falling Asleep on iPhone 7 Google Pixel Gets Hacked in Less than One Minute, Apple's Safari in 20 Seconds Microsoft Officially Announces Visual Studio for Mac Ubuntu Online Summit for Ubuntu 17.04 (Zesty Zapus) Starts Today, November 15 darktable 2.2 to Be a Major Release with RAW Overexposure Indication, New Tools Create Your Own Ubuntu 16.10 Live ISO with the New Linux For All (LFA) Distro Vivaldi 1.5 Web Browser Up to RC State, Fixes H.264 and MP3 Support for openSUSE 2 photos    iPhone 8 concept (front) new ios apps NeuroNation: Train your brain to improve your memory and focus with NeuroNation Flipagram: Create cool videos by mixing up your photos with music Timer+: Set up dozens of timers and control them all with ease Nutshell Camera: Create some pretty cool videos with Nutshell Camera IKEA Catalogue: Check out the IKEA Catalogue for more than just furniture Complete: Complete puts a social twist to your regular to-do list/ task manager WebMD Baby: WebMD Baby offers help in how to best tend to your baby Reader comments More Evidence Shows iPhone 8 Could Feature Revolutionary Wireless Charging more on: Apple i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

Register for an Exam Today> Apple Doubles Down on Running with Nike-Edition Smartwatch By Anick Jesdanun PUBLISHED: OCTOBER 31 2016 Apple isn't the first to add GPS functionality to a smartwatch, but it's the first to make something that feels like a running watch. And the company is doubling down on that with a Nike edition out Friday. As a frequent runner, I've found devices without GPS typically awful at measuring how fast and how far I'm running. And those with GPS typically do little more than measure how fast and how far I'm running. The basics are great for casual runners, but anyone who becomes a serious runner needs much more. I've logged more than 400 miles over the past six weeks with the GPS edition of Apple Watch, known as Series 2. I've also run 34 miles with the Nike Plus version over the past few days; it's essentially a Series 2 watch with a custom wristband and watch face. With both, Apple addressed many of the shortcomings in the original watch, GPS being just one of them. I'm not ready to ditch my Garmin running watch yet, but the Apple Watch comes close to meeting all my needs. Meanwhile, an updated Nike watch app out Friday will appeal to runners who already use Nike's phone app; a Nike-edition watch isn't necessary. The Importance of GPS The original watch does a fine job of latching onto your phone's GPS if you're running with the phone, but with built-in GPS, you can just leave the phone behind. Some GPS watches make you wait while they find a signal, but you can run immediately with Apple's. Accuracy is on par with other good GPS watches, which is to say, measurements are sometimes off, especially when tall buildings block GPS signals. The watch automatically calibrates to my running style, so it's better than non-GPS devices even when there's no GPS. Though GPS drains the battery more quickly, the watch still had about an hour of non-GPS use left after a marathon run of about four hours, 40 minutes. For normal use, Apple says you should be able to get up to 90 minutes a day of GPS workouts; I've often gone longer without the watch dying before bedtime. It helps that I've disabled the heart-rate sensor during workouts. While Series 2 is meant for stand-alone running, many people carry phones anyway. With it, I get slightly better accuracy and battery life. Improvements for All Series 2 watches start at $369, though it's $30 more for a larger screen -- the optimal size for larger wrists. Non-GPS models, now called Series 1, are $100 less. All models get software updates that address two gripes with the original: -- Apple's Workout app now records your route, something other GPS fitness devices and apps have long done. The Apple app didn't use to, even with access to the phone's GPS. -- You can double tap the screen to record splits, or manual snapshots of how long it takes to run a stretch. Before, that was limited to mile or kilometer intervals, which didn't help when you were running laps or loops that weren't precisely that length. Nike Extras Nike's app offers a lot to like, including big yellow numerals for easy reading during runs and voice updates every mile and halfway toward your goal. Nike keeps things simple for beginners by displaying just distance and time; turn on advanced mode for current pace and heart rate. My gripes: no manual splits, and average pace appears only when pausing or through the voice updates. The app tries to motivate even when you're not running. It will keep asking "Are we running today?" by reminding you the weather is nice or that a friend (with a watch or just the phone app) is just ahead of you for the month's total. A scheduling feature shows you upcoming times for running in half-hour increments, along with the weather forecast then. After you choose one, you get a notification when it's time to run. Though the app is available for all models, the Nike watch also has a colorful wristband sporting holes to help sweat dry. It offers custom watch faces with one-touch access to the app, just as the regular edition has one-touch access to Apple's Workout app. Most people will be fine with just the free app, but the Nike watch for Nike loyalists is available for the same price. Beyond Running Cyclists get similar speed and distance information, though the watch doesn't measure how fast you're pedaling, something hard-core cyclists might want. You can swim with Series 2, even with chlorinated or salt water, something most water-resistant gadgets don't allow. The watch measures distance indoors by counting laps, though you need a pool large enough for at least five strokes per lap. What's Still Missing Recording splits during runs is great, but I also want to know my average pace and time since the last split, rather than the beginning of the run. I find it useful when workouts aren't supposed to be even; I might want to go faster in the middle of the run before a gentle cooldown. And while Apple Watch syncs workout data with the phone's Activity app, many long-time runners already have their favorite online repository, whether that's Nike, Strava or Garmin. The ability to move data around is limited. While Nike offers an Apple Watch app, it'll take time for others to catch up. Strava's still requires running with a phone, while Garmin doesn't have one at all. For these reasons, I'm sticking with my Garmin Forerunner 220. And while it's a minor annoyance, both Apple's and Nike's app do a three-second countdown before workouts. I just want to run when I hit "start." Do You Need an Apple Watch? Because this review is focused on runners' needs, I haven't gotten into all the other features, such as maps, weather and shopping. Running watches and general-purpose fitness trackers such as Fitbit don't offer as much. The ability to reply to messages by voice came in handy when coordinating with friends waiting at the finish line, for instance. But if you don't need the "smarts," a decent GPS fitness device is more than $100 cheaper. © 2016 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge. All rights reserved.

 Developers are finding renewed interest in Apple TV BI Intelligence Oct. 31, 2016, 9:28 AM 1,366 facebook linkedin twitter email print BII See Also Everything you wanted to know about chatbots but were afraid to ask This is how Taco Bell, Starbucks, and other fast-food chains are using mobile to boost order values The Rise of M-Commerce: Mobile Shopping Stats & Trends This story was delivered to BI Intelligence Apps and Platforms Briefing subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. Apple TV developers are finally seeing the living room device as a viable platform for app development. There are now more than 8,000 Apple TV apps available, representing growth of around 700% from the 1,000 apps reported over the same period last year, according to comments made by Apple CEO Tim Cook last Thursday. And although that's still a drop in the ocean compared with the more than 2 million smartphone apps available, this remarkable growth is a boon for the new platform, which has been suffering from user engagement issues. Apple also unveiled a new Apple TV app, called TV, aimed at helping users better navigate Apple TV content.  Apple tvOS developers are struggling to keep users engaged, according to mobile analytics firm Adjust. The analysis of almost 300,000 app users, of which 2% are active Apple TV users, found the following: Just 9% of users return to Apple TV apps seven days after download. The retention rate for Apple TV apps gets worse after a month, plummeting to just 4% of users. For context, nearly 20% of iPad users and 18.5% of iPhone users return to an app within seven days. Aside from discovery issues, low engagement rates may be a result of the passive nature of the Apple TV experience. That is, the content viewed on TVs typically includes videos, pictures, and streaming TV, notes TechCrunch. Still, the Apple TV is a relatively new platform, giving the company time to introduce new ways to make it a much more engaging experience for users, in turn increasing its value for developers. The introduction of Apple's new TV app is one way the company is working to do this. But if Apple TV does truly take off, then where would it fit in the future of the television landscape? Over the last few years, there’s been much talk about the “death of TV.” However, television is not dying so much as it's evolving: extending beyond the traditional television screen and broadening to include programming from new sources accessed in new ways. It's strikingly evident that more consumers are shifting their media time away from live TV, while opting for services that allow them to watch what they want, when they want. Indeed, we are seeing a migration toward original digital video such as YouTube Originals, SVOD services such as Netflix, and live streaming on social platforms. However, not all is lost for legacy media companies. Amid this rapidly shifting TV landscape, traditional media companies are making moves across a number of different fronts — trying out new distribution channels, creating new types of programming aimed at a mobile-first audience, and partnering with innovate digital media companies. In addition, cable providers have begun offering alternatives for consumers who may no longer be willing to pay for a full TV package. Dylan Mortensen, senior research analyst for BI Intelligence, has compiled a detailed report on the future of TV that looks at how TV viewer, subscriber, and advertising trends are shifting, and where and what audiences are watching as they turn away from traditional TV.  Here are some key points from the report: Increased competition from digital services like Netflix and Hulu as well as new hardware to access content are shifting consumers' attention away from live TV programming. Across the board, the numbers for live TV are bad. US adults are watching traditional TV on average 18 minutes fewer per day versus two years ago, a drop of 6%. In keeping with this, cable subscriptions are down, and TV ad revenue is stagnant. People are consuming more media content than ever before, but how they're doing so is changing. Half of US TV households now subscribe to SVOD services, like Netflix, Amazon, and Hulu, and viewing of original digital video content is on the rise. Legacy TV companies are recognizing these shifts and beginning to pivot their business models to keep pace with the changes. They are launching branded apps and sites to move their programming beyond the TV glass, distributing on social platforms to reach massive, young audiences, and forming partnerships with digital media brands to create new content. The TV ad industry is also taking a cue from digital. Programmatic TV ad buying represented just 4% (or $2.5 billion) of US TV ad budgets in 2015 but is expected to grow to 17% ($10 billion) by 2019.

Thursday, October 27, 2016 [Tweets] [Favorites] New MacBook Pros and the State of the Mac Updates: October 28, 29, 30, 31, November 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. I was really disappointed with today’s Apple event. It seems like Apple has either lost its way, that it has lost touch with what (some of) its customers want, or that it simply doesn’t care about those customers. Developers are a captive audience, and creative professionals can switch to Windows, I guess. Apple no longer considers them core. There’s nothing particularly wrong with what Apple announced. I like Thunderbolt 3. The display looks good. I’m not crazy about Touch Bar, but it does seem potentially useful. The problem is that the MacBook Pro is not a true Pro notebook. My Retina MacBook Pro is almost 4.5 years old. I’ve been wanting to upgrade it for a while and was planning to do so today. After seeing what was announced, I’m no longer sure that I want a MacBook Pro as my main computer. Unfortunately, the current iMac and Mac Pro don’t seem like good choices, either. I wish that Apple were still licensing the operating system to clone manufacturers, who might make the sort of machine I want to buy. And not neglect whole sections of the product line. The new MacBook Pro has a premium price for a Mac that’s still limited to 16 GB of RAM, has CPU performance that is likely lackluster because Apple didn’t talk about it in the keynote, and apparently doesn’t have such a great GPU, either. Apple prioritized thinness and lightness, which I care about hardly at all. I would rather have better performance, a good keyboard, more storage, a larger display, more ports so I don’t have to carry dongles, an SD card slot, etc. Double the weight and half the battery life would be fine with me. I’m not saying Apple shouldn’t make thin and light notebooks, but why do they all have to be that way? Shara Tibken and Connie Guglielmo: Marketing chief Phil Schiller, software engineering lead Craig Federighi and top designer Jony Ive explained, in exclusive interviews earlier this week, why the Mac matters. Since they say it’s so important to Apple, we asked them why it took four years, four months and 16 days to deliver what they call a “milestone” and a “big step forward” for its top-of-the-line laptops. “The calendar isn’t what drives any of the decisions,” Schiller says[…] “We didn’t want to just create a speed bump on the MacBook Pro,” he says. “In our view this is a big, big step forward. It is a new system architecture, and it allows us to then create many things to come, things that we can’t envision yet.” […] Even Cook questioned why anyone would buy a personal computer instead of an iPad Pro, saying in an interview last year [links added], “Why would you buy a PC anymore? No really, why would you buy one?” Cook didn’t answer our question about that. It has seemed clear for a while that the CEO doesn’t really understand the Mac, or simply doesn’t like it that much, and that’s a problem for those of us who do. Jeff Johnson: Apple was famous for their ecosystem integration. But out of the box you can’t plug a new iPhone into a new MacBook Pro. Absurd. Dermont Daly: Even Apple Support aren’t getting it. Marco Arment: Despite most of us not buying it for years, it’s worth noting that the last upgradeable Mac laptop went away today. Colin Cornaby: With an SSD capacity range of 256 gigs to 2 TBs it would still be much more reasonable if Apple added upgrades after purchase. Peter Kirn (via Michael Yacavone): It was really hard for me to watch Apple’s “Hello Again” event today. Understanding history is important – to a point. But Apple’s obsessive naval gazing in the Mac event today speaks volumes. This is a company with no real vision for what its most creative users actually do with their most advanced machines. So, instead, they look into the past. […] The competition is faster, and/or costs less – so those graphs turned to older Apple products and even the poor PowerBook 100 rather than compare to the PC. We didn’t even get a thinner/lighter comparison, because even that ship has sailed. The Mac made its name because it embraced desktop publishing and graphics when the PC missed the boat. Now, it seems Apple is about to miss next-generation graphics, 3D, and virtual reality. Even if some of those are gimmicks, the fact that we live in a three-dimensional world and have two eyes suggest it’s still an important development. Previously: Apple Said to Plan First Pro Laptop Overhaul in Four Years. Update (2016-10-28): Felix Schwarz: Here’s how the 15" #MacBookPro 2016 component specs compare to the 2012 model. Brian Stucki: Reminder: The current Mac Pro page brags about the performance with Aperture, a program that Apple retired 2+ years ago. Mark Walton: Don’t expect to do much gaming on your shiny new MacBook Pro. Thomas Brand: “All MacBook Pros now use ‘onboard SSDs’ a la the MacBook” If your logic board dies your data dies with it. Backup your new MacBook people. Owen Williams (Hacker News): Apple spent the entire event comparing itself to its own past, rather than showing us the future, and even then painted a very clear picture: it has no idea who the Mac is for. Jason Snell: On stage Thursday, Schiller said that the MacBook Pro’s keyboard was a second-generation version of the MacBook keyboard and featured design changes to give it more movement feel. As someone who is not a fan of the very small amount of keyboard travel on the MacBook keyboard, I noted the phrasing. He didn’t say the keys moved more, just that they felt better. Well, it’s my sad duty to report that the MacBook Pro keyboard has the same key travel as the MacBook. Apple says the stainless steel dome switch beneath each key has been honed to give you a more responsive feel, but to me it feels just like the MacBook’s keyboard. Dan Frakes: Because Apple’s website lets you compare only two laptops at a time, here’s a spreadsheet of MacBook specs. McCloud: I wouldn’t call the new MBP GPU options competitive with mid-range. Joe Cieplinski: The days of the sub $1,000 Mac are done. I thought the Air would stick around for another generation because of this price tier, but then I thought about it more carefully. Low-cost PCs make almost no sense anymore. Adam Knight: After watching yesterday’s Apple Event and reading around a bit at the reactions, I’ve become concerned for the future of the Mac, at least in the hands of the current leadership at Apple. […] I can’t help but feel Apple has decided the core audience of their Unix-based powerhouse OS is the latte-sipping children in campus coffee shops and anything at all about their systems that appeals to anyone else is just something to be removed in the path to a sheet of paper with nothing but content. Frankly, it’s that total disconnect between what computer users want and what mobile users want that has me worried about the Mac. The source of my fear — after much contemplation — is that the same people that design the Mac are designing the iOS devices, and that’s a horrible situation for both platforms. See also: Accidental Tech Podcast Core Intuition Alexey Semeney (via Hacker News) Update (2016-10-29): Brent Simmons: Except — and this part shouldn’t be underestimated — many of these Mac developers are here because Macs are the computer for creative professionals and artists. That’s what attracted us to Macs in the first place. It’s more than a niche. It’s our identity as Mac developers: we write apps for people who make things. But what if the Surface Studio takes over as the computer for people who make things? And what if we could bring over some of our investment (such as learning Swift) with us? Jeff Benjamin: If you’re holding out for an Apple-branded 4K or 5K standalone display, you should probably stop waiting. Apple is reportedly out of the standalone display business for good, according to The Verge’s Nilay Patel. Vlad Savov: Apple’s new MacBook Pro family is universally more expensive than the one it’s replacing: the supposedly entry-level MBP, lacking a Touch Bar, starts at $1,499. To get a Touch Bar, the least you’d need to spend is $1,799, and if you want to go beyond 13 inches, the 15-inch MacBook Pro starts at $2,399. Upgrade the processor and graphics, opt for 2TB of storage, and you’ll reach the incredible heights of $4,299. Yoni Heisler: Apple’s new MacBook Pro has created quite a stir in the Mac community, with many developers and creative professionals expressing outrage and frustration that Apple has seemingly created a Pro machine that is decidedly underwhelming and watered down. Apple pissing off the pro community is an especially interesting dynamic because, as many seasoned Mac observers can attest, Apple managed to survive some of its darker days in the early to mid 90s precisely because the Mac was the computer of choice for a wide swath of creative professionals. David Owens II: To me, Thursday’s event signaled one thing for me, and maybe I’m completely wrong, but the Mac is officially over. […] Apple, the MacBook Pro is not a pro-level computer. It’s simply not. You want to see what a pro-level laptop looks like? Look at the Razer lineup. They are crushing it on terms of performance and style in hardware design. Chuck Toporek: As a long-time Mac user, today’s event left me with more questions than answers about the Mac’s future. And what’s more telling is just how out of touch Apple is with their own user-base, at least when it comes to desktops and laptops. Rui Carmo: As far as I’m concerned, Apple is completely out of touch with my segment (call it UNIX-centric pros, if you will), so I’m going to seriously rethink my options over the next couple of weeks. Rui Carmo: I actually use and rely upon that top row too much to feel comfortable with the idea of a touch bar. Ted Landau: Apple’s desktop Mac lineup is headed for the graveyard. Dead. Done. Over. Why do I believe this? Because of the unstated implications of what Apple announced (and didn’t announce) at its media event yesterday. Seth Lewin: Apple no longer makes anything I care to buy. Flat statement. Sad to admit after nearly 30 years of buying their products but true. Apple could care less what its customers think or say or want, it seems. Ruffin Bailey: Did Apple build a truck? Do they even care about trucks any more? I think the quick answer is no. He bought a Lenovo with 24 GB of RAM for $850. Alex Guyot: The new trackpad is 2 times larger than the trackpad on the previous MacBook Pro for the 15-inch machine. It’s slightly less than 2x larger for the 13-inch. Other than the increased size this is the same Force Touch trackpad that has been shipping on MacBook Pros since last year. […] Sadly, this change spells the end of MagSafe on Apple’s MacBook Pro line. No longer are MacBooks safe from people tripping over power cords while they are charging. Lloyd Chambers: The people at Apple no longer have a clue what is desirable in a computer. At this, Apple is now incompetent. Tim Cook thinks everyone should just use an iPad. Out of touch with the reality of what core traditional Mac users is an understatement: yes iPhone and iPad are popular. Which is precisely why computers should distinguish themselves as computers. Not iPad-like stripped down gimmicks. It’s called market differentiation. Instead Apple pursues convergence. Gabe Weatherhead: I think the next few years will be awkward and actual real-world use of MacBooks will look more like the lone airport electrical outlet than the sleek design in the Apple presentations. The price of a dock will seem too expensive and many people will opt for a death by a thousand dongles. But, I think this is a transitional period leading to a much better future. Craig Grannell: I can’t remember the last Apple event where I came away actually quite annoyed, but there it was. […] The inference was Apple’s new MacBook Pro broadly replaces the MacBook Air, and yet the former is considerably more expensive. The new MacBook Pro – impressive though it is – also happens to be spendy for even professional users. Juli Clover: An entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro with a Touch Bar costs $1,799, a full $500 more than previous-generation models, and 15-inch models start at $2,399. Schiller says Apple cares about price, but has to design for experience rather than cost. Nick Heer: I’m not complaining about the new MacBook Pros. They look incredibly powerful, ridiculously thin, and have amazing displays. But they are very spendy right now, and that’s an especially hard pill to swallow when the Mac seems to receive less attention than it used to. Juli Clover: While there is no new MacBook Air available for purchase, Apple is continuing to offer the 13-inch MacBook Air models that were last updated in 2015. […] At $999, the MacBook Air is $500 cheaper than the new entry-level MacBook Pro and $300 cheaper than the entry-level Retina MacBook. Juli Clover: According to the document, while all of the ports on the 15-inch MacBook Pro and the 13-inch MacBook Pro without a Touch Bar offer full Thunderbolt 3 performance, only two of the four ports on the 13-inch MacBook Pro with a Touch Bar support Thunderbolt 3 at full performance. Michael B. Johnson: Very disappointed with the state of Mac hardware. No good excuses left. For me it’s not about the laptops, it’s about the Mac lineup. Mac Pro doesn’t have Thunderbolt 3 or vaguely current GPUs. Infuriating. They are NOT complemented by performant desktop Macs, therefore they serve as pro desktops, which they are clearly NOT. Stephen Foskett: You’re about to enter a world of confusion thanks to those new “USB-C” ports. See, that simple-looking port hides a world of complexity, and the (thankful) backward-compatibility uses different kinds of cables for different tasks. Shoppers have to be very careful to buy exactly the right cable for their devices! […] The core issue with USB-C is confusion: Not every USB-C cable, port, device, and power supply will be compatible, and there are many different combinations to consider. […] If you’re not careful, you can neuter or even damage your devices by using the wrong cable. Seriously: Using the wrong cable can damage your machine! This should not be possible, but there it is. Riccardo Mori: As a technology observer and enthusiast, I like the new MacBook Pros a lot. […] At the same time, I’m getting tired of this obsession with lighter/thinner at each design iteration. Professionals are more interested in sheer performance, in machines that can be upgraded and expanded down the road. Why can’t Apple leave the light & thin to the consumer line of notebooks, and offer pro notebooks that follow a more ‘function over form’ approach? What once was a clear distinction between ‘consumer’ and ‘pro’ machine, has now become something more like ‘regular’ versus ‘deluxe’ machines. Nowadays, a professional computer shouldn’t be constrained by a maximum of 16 GB of RAM. I know a few people who are barely comfortable with 32. Considering the non-trivial investment when you purchase one at its maximum tech specs, these MacBook Pros are supposed to last a few years. Jeff Johnson: Those complaining about Apple’s current Mac lineup are not haters, they’re lovers. They’ve spent 10+ years and 5+ figures on Macs. These aren’t Luddites who simply hate change. These are people who already had blank checks written to Apple but had to tear up the checks. Lloyd Chambers: The table below summarizes various options for using existing displays, card readers, Thunderbolt 2 devices, USB devices, etcetera on the late 2016 MacBook Pro (the 13" and 15" models both have the same type of ports, 4 ports for the 15" model, 2 ports for the 13" model). overcast: 16GB RAM limits on a $3200 laptop is bewildering to me. If the strategy here is to kill off the Mac brand, while focusing only on the iPhone, then I think they are well on their way. Tom Bridge: I no longer believe the design team at Apple is innovating to make the best product experience, rather they’re deep in “pure math” territory, exploring the boundaries of innovation itself. I feel like this can go one of two ways. One of these is a future where Apple is a pillar of the desktop and laptop community, one of these is a future where the Mac is both expensive and underperforms. kornakiewicz: I’ve been waiting few months for yesterday’s MacBook upgrade and I’m dissatisfied, as most of you. I read many comments about alternatives and one of recurring favorite is Dell XPS Developer Edition. Could I ask you about your experience with this model? Brian Benchoff (via Hacker News): In the past, I have defended people who choose MacBooks as their laptop of choice. A MacBook is a business-class laptop, and of course carries a higher price tag. However, Apple’s latest hardware release was underwhelming and overpriced. If you’re looking for a new laptop, you would do well to consider other brands. To that end, here’s a buyer’s guide to ThinkPads, currently the second most popular laptop I’ve seen with the dev/hacker/code cracker crowd. Steven Levy (via Hacker News): This week had the rare circumstance of two aged-but-still-sprightly competitors unveiling products on successive days. On Wednesday, Microsoft— formerly the heavyweight champion of the personal computer world on the basis of its software—actually introduced its first desktop computer. The Surface Studio is the result of an epically long transfer of Microsoft’s surface technology from research project, to bar room gaming device, to tablet, to desktop. It features a ginormous 28-inch touch-screen and an ingenious dial for precision zooming and menu-selecting. It’s also got a sheen of design haughtiness once unheard of in the precincts of Windows-land. The cheapest version is $3,000. A day later, Apple ended the long wait for laptop users yearning for an upgrade by unveiling a new line of MacBook Pros. With the exception of a novel feature called the Touch Bar — a multi-touch strip above the keyboard that Disney-fies what function keys used to do — these new machines were pretty predictable iterations of how Apple does generations these days: thinner, faster, and more expensive. Matthew Johnson: In 2016 I do not want to charge, carry, and maintain two devices just because there are two important interaction models, each of which is better suited to some tasks and circumstances than the other. In many respects this is reminiscent of how it felt in 2005 and 2006 to carry a cell phone and an iPod everywhere you go. […] Apple’s failure to announce a solution to this problem right now is not terribly concerning on its own. But presenting the new MacBook Pro and Touch Bar as a truly revolutionary announcement, cast in a historical light, coming at the end of an extremely long dry spell falls flat. Chuq Von Rospach: There’s a huge amount of criticism of Apple coming out online after this event. And there’s a lot to criticize Apple about, unfortunately, because while they updated these laptops, they didn’t even mention the rest of the Mac product line, and the huge questions about where Apple sees this line going over the next few years weren’t even acknowledged, much less addressed. […] What is Apple’s long-term strategy for pro apps? To be honest, Final Cut seems like a prosumer app that is used by pros, not a pro app that’s used by prosumers. What’s the future of Logic? they’ve killed Aperture, is it next? Am I going to be pushed to Premiere and Audition in the next two years? […] Where are the updates to the desktop line? Where are the developer-class macs? And what about users who need high hardware with larger memory configurations? These new laptops all max out at 16Gb which is fine for, I’d wager, 95% of users, but for that other 5%? Is Apple really suggesting they head off to Microsoft instead? Update (2016-10-30): Milen Dzhumerov (Hacker News): From where I’m standing, Apple are redefining (shrinking) their target audience for the Mac platform. If you feel left out by the latest updates and the neglect on the desktop, it’s simple as Apple deciding not to serve your segment’s needs. I know that it can feel quite personal to Mac devotees, like me, but it’s simply business and strategy. […] This one-size approach has fundamental flaws because we haven’t reached the stage where the tradeoffs are acceptable to high-demanding professionals. Almost every choice we make in this life is all about tradeoffs: it’s the same in hardware engineering. For example, making laptops thinner and lighter means sacrificing performance that you wouldn’t if you did not have those constraints. […] The counterargument that I’ll make is that if you lose the professionals, you’ll lose a significant chunk of innovation and content that keeps consumers in the Apple ecosystem. Those professionals are content creators and if they use Macs at work, they’re more likely to use Macs at home and create for Apple platforms. Professionals are influencers and affect the computing choices of their immediate family & friends. Colin Cornaby: Apple appears to be offering the highest end Polaris 11 part available: the Radeon 460. This is a huge improvement over previous generations where Apple tended to only use the middle end of AMD’s mobile offerings. But while AMD has improved their performance compared to their previous generation, they’ve failed to take the performance crown from Nvidia. Nvidia’s low end professional notebook GPU, the GTX 1060m, is still almost twice as fast as the Radeon 460. The issue with the new Macbook Pro is it ignores everything professionals have been asking for, while adding things that they didn’t. Unnecessarily making the laptop thinner prevents them from using a mobile GPU like Nvidia’s 1080m, which offers nearly four times the performance of the Radeon 460. […] Apple also ignored almost the full list of what pros were looking for in a new Macbook Pro: features like upgradable storage, higher resolution displays, more RAM, external graphics expansion… Apple is pushing this laptop as a 4k editing professional notebook, but hasn’t even equipped it with a 4k display. […] The monitor not being Apple branded means it is no longer Apple supported. When you buy an Apple branded monitor with a Mac, it’s covered under the same warranty as your Mac. If your Mac had three year AppleCare, your monitor was covered for three years too. And your monitor was serviced at the same local stores your Mac was serviced at. Hellbound Wracker: I guess Apple thinks of the MBP15 as a mortifyingly-huge portable device, doesn’t realize its customers think of it as desktop that travels. Greg Koenig: The sad thing about all this, is just how unnecessary it feels. It wold not take much for Apple to delight hardcore Mac users. Ben Brooks: Apple didn’t launch a crappy product, they launched devices which still are the best option on the market. Which still have top notch industrial design. Which still have the best operating system. Which still have the best third party apps on any desktop platform. Which are still the best option for most people in the world. And frankly, if you can’t see that, then you need to go buy a non-Mac laptop and see for yourself how bad it truly is. Tim Bray (Hacker News): Apple thinks thin-and-light is more important than well-equipped-and-powerful. […] My best bet is to buy a future Mac that’s aimed at people like me. Which requires that Apple wants to build one; they don’t at the moment, but maybe they will again before this box I’m typing on runs out of gas. Rui Carmo: It’s not just about their removing the startup chime, or expansiblity. It’s about the honest reviews, the way marketing has taken over and the realization that the Mac, the foundation of what became Apple’s empire and still the only platform people can develop on for iOS, is effectively neglected, and that whatever Apple needs to do to try to regain their Pro user base, the new MacBooks are not it — or, at least, definitely not enough. Lloyd Chambers: The killer feature of the late 2016 Apple MacBook Pro may be its wide-gamut display, the best ever offered by Apple, and perhaps the best in any laptop—to be seen. […] The #1 disappointment with the late 2016 Apple MacBook Pro is its 16GB memory limit, which inherently places a performance limitation on professional usage. exploding_m1 (via Tony Arnold): So, a lot of people have been disappointed at the lack of a 32gb option. Apple’s statement is true, but lacks detail. The true reason behind the lack of 32gb or ddr4 is intel. Skylake does not support LPDDR4 (LP for low power) ram. Kabylake is set to include support, but only for the U category of chips. So no LPDDR4 support for mobile until 2018 I think. lorenzojc: Meh, the ThinkPad P50 and P70 pack a Xeon processor, 64 GB of ECC memory and a Quadro graphics card. So do the zbook from HP. pier25: The Razer Blade comes with a Skylake i7 6700HQ and DDR4. Update (2016-10-31): Maciej Ceglowski (as Benjamin Button): Everything about the new machine seems designed for typists. The trackpad has been made smaller, so you’re less likely to brush against it with your palm. The keys themselves are much more comfortable to type on, with improved key travel, a softer feel, and more satisfying tactile feedback. You no longer feel like you’re tapping on the glass surface of an iPad. And not having a TouchBar means no longer having to look down at your hands all the time. Despite the many improvements, Apple is actually dropping the price on its flagship 15" MacBook Pro by $400, another sign that they’re serious about winning over developers. David Owens II: Now, the MacBook Pro is not everything I want in a laptop. It is most certainly not everything that I want in a desktop computer. But, when the dust settles, it’s still a Mac. With all of the warts that macOS has, with all of the mind boggling decisions that Apple makes with some of their products at time, is there really any other platform I’d rather be using? See also: Hacker News. Steven Frank: The level of pushback from the MacBook Pro event is staggering. I sure hope someone at Apple who can make a difference is paying attention. Chuq Von Rospach (tweet, Hacker News): Under the assumption that there are updated desktops coming after the first of the year, I think it would have made sense to mention that, just so users waiting for them can stop feeling abandoned. It doesn’t require a lot of disclosure, but I think it was time for at least some. […] I’ve come to the belief that the trash can Mac pro, the “Can’t Innovate my Ass” machine, is a product mistake of the “20th Century Anniversary Macintosh” caliber. It was a technological marvel, it was a stunning design, and it was a terrible piece of hardware for it’s primary audiences because of limited upgradability and component flexibility — and then Apple compounded that by not having good upgrade plans in place to refresh it since the design it created wouldn’t let its users do it for themselves. […] The fact is, the Mac product line itself is becoming a niche product, because the days of the personal computer have started the shift back to where computers will be a hobby for the nerd and for the mainstream user, devices which use computers to enable tasks are starting to replace them: that includes tablets, but also gaming consoles and whatever it is that will ultimately take ownership of the living room. Baron Chandler: The minute the argument dismisses concerns by urging people to use their VT-100 if upset, it’s gone Godwin AFAIC. Brent Simmons: What I actually want, though, is a powerful desktop Mac that can compile my apps really, really fast. Ruffin Bailey: Here are some quick benchmarks for my $700 Lenovo Y700 vs. the $1500 “low-end” MacBook Pro I talked about Friday […] Remember, for $850, you’ve got 24 gigs of RAM and 128 Gigs of SSD (plus a terabyte of spinning platter storage) on that Lenovo. Benjamin Encz: Apple has always been a premium brand and its loyal customers have embraced it. But this premium price was paid for a whole product that worked well out of the box and was well integrated into Apple’s ecosystem. Today this increase in price stands in a stark contrast to the decrease in software quality in the last years and the product design issues I discussed. Roman Loyola (via Kirk McElhearn): If you’re planning to buy a new MacBook Pro, make sure you set aside a considerable amount of cash for the adapters you need. Apple doesn’t include any in the box, except for a power adapter. And it doesn’t include the cable from the power brick to the wall. Jeff Carlson: I don’t fall on the Apple-is-doomed spectrum (hell, we’ve been through enough of that), but this does seem like an unusual move for the company. Robert Cringely (via Hacker News): This very durability presents a problem for Apple that they’ve tried to deal with by eventually stopping software support for older machines. That’s why the Mac Minis of my kids now run Ubuntu. Old Macs get handed down or sold on Craigslist and that’s a problem for Apple, but not nearly as big a problem as the fact that pretty much everyone who wants a smart phone now has one. Yes, Apple has a problem — a problem most other companies would love to have: customers like the products too much so the market is becoming saturated. Peter Sphilio (via Hacker News): Why do some car and motorcycle companies have the courage to devote significant resources to racing? […] The reason Apple should spend money on creating and marketing true professional hardware is the very same reason for which car and motorcycle companies devote significant resources to racing; because it provides them with credibility. When motor companies race, they are affirming their ability to create the very best possible product, the one that no other group can challenge. Brian Fagioli (via Slashdot, Hacker News): While you might expect some of these disappointed Apple loyalists to turn to a Windows machine -- and I’m sure some will -- some are turning to an unexpected alternative -- Linux. You see, immediately after the Apple Keynote, famed Ubuntu laptop and desktop seller, System76, saw a huge jump in traffic from people looking to buy its machines. Michael Gartenberg: Overall, it’s a dramatic shift from where Apple and Microsoft used to be. Microsoft is now appealing directly to creative professionals with hardware, and software innovations. Apple is introducing solid, workhorse devices that lack the magic of previous updates. Even the “birth” videos reflected a difference in how these machines are going to be sold. Microsoft’s felt more Apple-y than Apple’s this time around. It wasn’t long ago I’d watch an Apple keynote and dream of all the new things I’d be able to do. This week, though, I’m dreaming about the Surface Studio. Ben Slaney (via Greg Koenig): The Federal Aviation Administration has capped the maximum allowable size of laptop batteries on flights to 100 watt-hours. That explains why Apple’s 2015 pro model contains precisely a 99.5 watt-hour battery. Although the recent MBP release only contains a 76 watt-hour battery, due to the fact that there is no low-power RAM available in greater than 16GB capacities for Intel’s latest mobile CPU it can be argued that Apple are still working within that 100 watt-hour ceiling, and that they are using the best components that they can given that ceiling. Seems like this is where USB-C battery packs could come in handy. Apple makes an external iPhone battery pack, and it isn’t pretty, but apparently it works very well. Colin Devroe: I don’t care about lighter or thinner. I care about performance, storage, reliability. Colin Devroe: A rift. A schism. We are witnessing it. I believe anyway. John Gruber: The second paragraph above shows the difference. In the first paragraph, Cook is questioning why anyone would buy a (Windows/Linux) PC. In the second, he’s saying many people don’t even need a notebook or desktop, period, implicitly including Mac notebooks and desktops. It’s not clear to me that Cook has always used “PC” to mean non-Mac. In any case, the second paragraph expresses pretty much the same sentiment and clearly includes Macs, and Cook declined to elaborate when interviewed a year later about the MacBook Pro. John Gruber (tweet): Rather astounding how much backlash last week’s event has generated. I can’t recall an Apple event that generated such a negative reaction from hard-core Mac users. I’m looking forward to his longer piece. John Gruber: The argument against this design is that it’s backwards — that for MacBooks targeting pro users, Apple should start with high performance specs and then build a machine that supports things like 32 GB of RAM. If they had done that, they’d have wound up with thicker, heavier designs. Many actual pro users would be delighted by that. Apple simply places a higher priority on thinness and lightness than performance-hungry pro users do. Ron Offringa: Typically when Apple makes big changes to their products they explain them. Lately Apple hasn’t been doing that. Why is 1 port better than 2? Why is USB-C better than MagSafe? Why is a keyboard that is tolerated at best now standard? Update (2016-11-01): Dave Mark: Apple did a superlative job with the MacBook Pro reveal. The Touch Bar itself is a thing of beauty, but Apple prepared well here, bringing a variety of apps to the stage to put the Touch Bar through its paces, to show how this Touch Bar makes possible a brand new way of interacting with your computer. This is so much more than what I expected, so much more than programmable soft keys. […] Lots to absorb, lots to read, but so far, sounds like Apple has a real winner here. Dave Mark: If this were simply a bunch of curmudgeonly complaints, we’d have skipped the post entirely. But there are a lot of fair complaints in this list, insights that are worth paying attention to. See also: MBP Prices Over Time. Alex Payne: In conversation over two years ago, we converged on an assumption: Apple and Microsoft will taper off their investments in pro hardware and software while they chase bigger, easier money in the consumer and enterprise spaces. History being known to repeat itself, we saw a moment on the horizon not unlike the one in which NeXT and Be emerged. We figured there were some instructive lessons from the histories of those upstarts. We wondered if the right team could move pro computing forward today, and by measures beyond small increments. […] Apple will only see an exodus of pro users if it turns out they’ve shipped a machine that truly can’t meet the needs – the actual working limits – of their customers. Armchair grumbles about misfeatures, memory limits, and the wrong ports aren’t the same as being totally unable to do your job because your tools have utterly failed you. I don’t think that’s where most pro users are today, but some are starting to recognize that today’s professional computing tools aren’t likely to carry us forward into new ways of working. Lucas Mearian (via Mike Rundle): Apple, a company that has led the laptop industry in its use of PCIe solid-state drives (SSDs), again upped the ante in performance with its latest refresh of the MacBook Pro, which may be the highest performing stock system on the market. Manton Reece (tweet): I might have doubts about the Mac product line, but overall I like the new MacBooks. The outrage seems overblown. I tend to agree. As I said at the top, these new MacBook Pros are not what I was looking for, and I have concerns about the Mac product line, but the level of outrage is way beyond what I expected when writing this post. Baldur Bjarnason: I suspect many of those annoyed about the event are in my position: the fact that the Touch Bar is interesting just makes it more annoying that Apple just announced a line of computers that I can’t really use. […] For a developer work machine, 16GB is the uncomfortable minimum requirement. It does not cover the needs of a developer’s average workday without us making some compromises in our workflow and productivity. John Gruber: But that’s not most MacBook Pro users. Most MacBook Pro users will do just fine with 16 GB of RAM (in fact, most will do just fine with the 13-inch models’ default configuration of 8 GB). For most MacBook Pro users, Apple is right to prioritize battery life over the maximum RAM configuration. […] This might make people who want such things even angrier (than if they were technical limitations), but they’re both deliberate design choices. Update (2016-11-02): John Martellaro: By discussing the MacBook Pro only, Apple seemed to be saying, “We never intended, nor do we need, to talk about anything else.” Unsatisfying. Evidently, we are to take Apple’s silence on other Mac matters as a statement of steadfast indifference. […] Finally, the feeling we all at TMO got during this presentation is that Apple just doesn’t see a future in powerful desktop Macs. If you are a technical or creative professional, a MacBook Pro with the Touch Bar is going to be your thing. If that doesn’t do the trick, there’s little recourse available in the rest of the product line. You’ll need to turn elsewhere. Sean Hollister: If Apple had introduced a new MacBook Air last week, the company wouldn’t be facing down a mob of angry creative professionals. It might not have Apple software developers questioning whether the company has lost its way. Because the new MacBook Pro basically is a MacBook Air -- the most impressive Air ever made. […] Apple chose to market a thinner Pro instead of a faster Air, even though they’re basically the same thing. And that’s not lost on Apple -- it was Apple marketing VP Phil Schiller who suggested the 13-inch MacBook Pro (the one without the Touch Bar) was designed for MacBook Air buyers. Sean Hollister: “We are the company that stands for the builders, the makers, the creators.” Sounds like a thing Apple might say, no? But those are the words of Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella -- the guy who just ate Apple’s lunch. […] Here’s the truth: Apple’s new MacBook Pro isn’t for pros. Not all of them, anyhow. Chuq Von Rospach (tweet): Apple did a great job of introducing two new trees while ignoring the forest dying of drought around us. The more I think about it, the more I think that sums up my discomfort with the announcements this week. […] In 1997, Steve introduced his new philosophy for what products should have using this grid. 20 years later, we’re now trying to make sense of the Mac product line and we seem confused, so I decided to sit down and try to sort it out a bit. So here we are, the New Grid. Dave Lawrence: I’m a photographer, so the lack of an SD card slot stinks. The personality is leaving. The upgrade path is non-existent. Maybe the only saving grace is that Macs still run macOS, still the best operating system out there. And it could be that I would be just fine owning one of the new MacBook Pros. It’s just that right now I’m in the market for a new iMac, and those options aren’t all that appealing either. If/when an iMac update comes, do I see things getting better or worse? Worse. That’s what makes me nervous. Colin Cornaby: But the problem is Apple themselves is marketing the Macbook Pro as a desktop replacement. Curtis Herbert: Apple just gave me the computer I’ve been waiting ~3+ years for. No, really. […] I’m breaking my 4-year upgrade cycle early because Apple just shipped my unicorn. The beauty of the Retina 27" 5k iMac when I’m at my desk, the convenience of a rMBP the rest of the time. Lloyd Chambers: As it stands, there is a hidden extra cost of $200 or more if you’re like me and want to attach a USB3 SSD, USB3 card reader, Thunderbolt device, external display, etc. That’s about a 5% to 7% hidden cost increase. OWC has USB-C to USB adapter cables for about $9.99 so at least there is a low cost option for that common use case. Which brings the point to it: why isn’t there at least one token USB-C to USB adapter in the Apple box? Ben Lovejoy (Hacker News): I haven’t ever seen any stats, but my guess would be that the vast majority of MacBook owners never connect anything other than power to their machine. For those that do, mostly it will be just one or two USB devices, like a USB key and external drive. Joe Cieplinski: All joking aside, I do worry, reading my Twitter timeline over the past few days, that some people actually believe Apple makes decisions based on what the executives personally want, rather than what data tells them is viable. Phil Schiller (Slashdot, MacRumors): We’re steadfast in our belief that there are fundamentally two different products to make for customers and they’re both important. There’s iPhone and iPad which are single pieces of glass, they’re direct-manipulation, multi-touch and tend towards full-screen applications. […] Then there’s the Mac experience, dominated by our notebooks and that’s about indirect manipulation and cursors and menus. […] These are pro machines. If it was just about headphones then it doesn’t need to be there, we believe that wireless is a great solution for headphones. But many users have setups with studio monitors, amps, and other pro audio gear that do not have wireless solutions and need the 3.5mm jack. […] There has certainly been a lot of passionate dialogue and debate about the new MacBook Pro! Many things have impressed people about it, and some have caused some controversy. I hope everyone gets a chance to try it for themselves and see how great the MacBook Pro is. It is a really big step forward and an example of how much we continue to invest in the Mac. We love the Mac and are as committed to it, in both desktops and notebooks, as we ever have been. And we are proud to tell you that so far our online store has had more orders for the new MacBook Pro than any other pro notebook before. So there certainly are a lot of people as excited as we are about it. Lloyd Chambers: When you sit all but idle for 4+ years in the pro laptop space, and then finally produce a gorgeous laptop, one would hope for strong sales. […] From my perspective, Phil Schiller’s perspective on card readers is that of someone who has a dim understanding of the pro photography market, namely that the vast majority of cameras sold today (even pro cameras) have SDXC card slots (my pro Canon, Nikon, Sony, Sigma, Leica cameras all do so I rarely use CF cards any more). Schiller’s lame rationalization might be accepted by the ignorant. Michael Gartenberg: Unusual for Apple to defend design decisions like this. Problem is most people who transfer pictures want that SD. Nick Heer: First, the SD card doesn’t have to stick out. Every camera that I’ve used has a sprung locking mechanism to keep the card snugly in its slot. Something like that might be really elegant on a MacBook Pro, and would help prevent removing the card without ejecting it. […] As far as wireless transfer is concerned, it’s just not fast or reliable enough, especially for cameras producing 40-plus megabyte RAW images. Marco Arment: The difference between light-load and heavy-load battery life is staggering. catskull: I have actually lost sleep since the announcement. I keep going over in my mind alternate hardware, but the fact is that macOS (OS X) is the single best operating system for developers today. I am generalizing "developers". For any embedded development, or HDL stuff, OS X will not be a nice experience. But for web or mobile development (which I anticipate is quite larger than development that could not be done in OS X), it’s just better. Things work. If the don’t, there is a massive support system in place and worst case scenario you can drive <1hr to an Apple store and let them take care of it. Sure, there are edge cases there as well, but compared to the ultrabook you bought from Costco or any distribution of linux, you have much more support available. I do love my macbook pro (glass trackpad, backlit keyboard, good display), but I absolutely must have macOS. At this point my only hope is that a new distribution of Linux evolves that can seriously compete and works flawlessly on off the shelf hardware (such as the Dell XPS), but we’re not there yet. Elementary OS looks promising. Perhaps developers would fork Darwin completely and make a macOS competitor. dognotdog: The negative reaction is not because the new MBP is terrible when viewed in a vacuum, it is because people who would like (or actually need) more powerful hardware than the one-size-fits-all approach that seems to be Apple’s current course are no longer catered to, or so it seems. Personally, I don’t really care about the touch bar one way or another, but what I do care about is that I would like to have one machine I can do all my work on, which involves a wider range of things one a daily basis than is typical (e.g. video/image editing, GPU powered number crunching, coding, and sitting in moving vehicles plugged into a bunch of stuff). In the past few years, the 15" MBP has been the machine to do it all, but in it’s newest incarnation(s) I am no longer sure it would still be the best tool. It seems like gimmicks are added, but useful extras are stripped away. Maybe it’s just in the uncanny valley of progress with USB-C, but for the moment the way they went about it all or nothing seems like a major inconvenience, with all the “legacy” hardware I need to attach. And there’s minor things like removing the power brick’s cord. Marco Arment (tweet, 2): Having four USB-C ports is awesome. Having only four USB-C ports is going to hurt the versatility requirement of pro gear, because there’s a very real chance that you won’t have the right dongle when you need it. This is going to happen a lot, because even though USB-C is the future, it’s definitely not the present. John Gruber: But this is not how Apple thinks about transitions like this. They design for the future, and in doing so, they bring the future here faster. In the alternate universe where the new MacBook Pros ship with one USB-A port, the transition to ubiquitous USB-C peripherals and cables will happen at least a little slower. Michael Rockwell: Where the company and I don’t see eye-to-eye, though, is with the keyboard. The new MacBook Pro features a second-generation version of the butterfly-style keys introduced in the MacBook. I’m extremely hesitant to switch to this type of keyboard. Granted, I haven’t spent too much time with it, but the limited key travel felt terrible to me. And that’s setting aside the decreased distance between keys which makes it more difficult to know where my fingers were without looking. […] But Apple has me overlooking the mediocre keyboard with the inclusion of a giant trackpad and the Touch Bar — the most noteworthy feature in these new machines. Ruffin Bailey: Tim Cook uses “PC” to mean “anyone’s PC”. I know Jobs didn’t. Cook always has. Used to sound incongruous when he did it, but now that Windows is sort of a lesser beast, it makes some sense to stop with the Mac/PC dichotomy. Michael Simon: But it’s hard not to see a shift in Apple’s thinking. While its price is certainly commensurate with its predecessors, the new MacBook Pro isn’t your standard professional notebook. Rather, the latest flagship portables from Cupertino are more in line with the iPad Pro than the MacBook Pros they replace, and it could signal major changes ahead for the rest of the lineup. iFixit: The Butterfly 2.0 keys are indeed updated! Check this sweet MacBook/MacBook Pro (with function keys) rollover! John Gruber (tweet): I know a lot of people — DF readers, developer friends — who are deeply worried that Apple is sunsetting the Mac. […] But I would hold up as proof of Apple’s commitment to the Mac two things: the annual update cycle of the OS and the MacBook lineup. (Personally, I would prefer if they slowed down on major updates to MacOS and updated hardware more frequently with minor speed bumps.) Riccardo Mori: Call me an old-school Mac curmudgeon all you like, but I think a single regular USB port in the new MBP wouldn’t have hurt. The fact that one needs an adapter to even plug a common USB pendrive is ridiculous. When using the MBP at home, you can tolerate various adapters, but on the go it’s just annoying. Update (2016-11-03): See also: MacRumors. Mike Wuerthele (via Keir Thomas): Additionally, the system profiler’s report on the 13-inch MacBook Pro has no listing for S/PDIF Optical Digital Audio Output, while the 2012 and 2015 Retina MacBook Pro models do. AppleInsider contacted Apple about the matter, and was told that the feature was removed due to a lack of customers using the functionality. Additionally, we were told that “plenty of USB-C zero-latency professional peripherals are available now, or coming very soon” featuring optical audio out connectivity. This is right after Schiller’s statement (above) that Apple left the headphone jack on the MacBook Pro because of its uses for pro audio. I was able to try the MacBook Escape today at the Apple Store Maine Mall. (The models with Touch Bar will not be in stock, even as demo units, for about a month.) I find the “second generation” keyboard noticeably better than the MacBook One’s. I don’t like feel or the arrow key layout, but I think it would probably be tolerable for me, given that I mostly use an external keyboard. On the other hand, older MacBook Pro keyboard is probably the best that Apple has ever shipped in a notebook, and the MacBook One’s is probably the worst. My primary use case for the SD card slot is for a Time Machine drive while traveling. Hotel network connections are too slow for Internet backup, and the SD cards are compact enough that I can leave them inserted while loading and unloading the MacBook Pro from my bag. Even if a dongle weren’t required, a USB drive just wouldn’t work as well here. It would not fit in my laptop sleeve, and I would have to unmount it before disconnecting it. Update (2016-11-04): Accidental Tech Podcast makes a lot of interesting points, particularly about what it means that Apple is getting out of the external display business. Glenn Fleishman: The summary for potential late 2016 MacBook Pro owners is that all current USB-C devices, cables, and adapters will work when plugged into a MacBook Pro’s Thunderbolt 3 ports. However, Thunderbolt 3-specific devices won’t work with computers and other devices like the 12-inch MacBook whose USB-C ports are less capable. Greg Barbosa (MacRumors): After a battery of tests with their current lineup of USB-C and Thunderbolt products, Plugable learned that Apple’s newest MacBook Pros may not be compatible with currently available Thunderbolt 3 devices. This issue seems to specifically stem from the use of Texas Instruments controller chips in the Thunderbolt 3 devices. If true, this means that has Apple potentially shut out early adopters of the new technology. Clark Goble: To me the neglected part discussed was the touch pads. Why are they so big? I don’t think Apple gave a good reason at the Event and no one else has really explained them well. If you look at them they’re the size of a large iPhone. I think there’s something to that. Clark Goble: Some people use a MacBook Pro primarily as a desktop machine that they want to be able to occasionally move around easily. These people aren’t as concerned with battery life or weight. They’d rather have more ports than battery life. A different (much larger) group of people primarily want a powerful machine that they can run extended times on battery power and easily carry with them. For most of the life of the MacBook Pro the laptop met both these needs with only a few compromises. At least relative to the choices available at the time. Partially due to Intel’s own product lines this just isn’t true anymore. Next year’s CannonLake chips from Intel will help this problem a lot. They’ll significantly increase the amount of memory available. However I suspect the days of the MacBook Pro being able to meet both needs are gone. While this “transportable” market is small I don’t think it is negligible. It would be nice were Apple to simply take the old MacBook Pro form factor, drop the DP, power port, and one USB-A port and replace them with USB-C/TB3 ports. Leave the rest of the ports the same, put in a powerful Nvidea mobile GPU, have bigger fans, put in the top Intel chip, ignore the weight and be satisfied with battery life more akin to what the 2009 MacBook Pro had. There is a group of Apple fans who would love this device. Manton Reece: It’s a convenient narrative to group together both the migration away from USB-A and the one away from 3.5mm headphones. There are important differences, though. Jason Snell (Hacker News): Regardless, the Mac Pro has not been updated in an unconscionably long time. The current Mac Pro, which you can still buy, is three years old. It hasn’t been updated once. The Mac Pro may not sell many units at all—and truth be told, even two years ago the 5K iMac was arguably a better Mac than the Mac Pro—but it’s also symbolic. It represents some part of Apple’s commitment to its professional user base, a small but enthusiastic group that includes developers and other highly technical folks. And users of the MacBook Pro had to look on and wonder if Apple’s commitment to them was wavering, too. […] The danger for Apple is how many people are on those margins, and how influential those people are. If the company has miscalculated, it may cede users that keep the Mac platform strong, and that could slow the Mac’s momentum when compared to the PC industry at large. […] A larger danger for Apple, I think, is affordability. The move to Retina has dramatically increased the price of all of Apple’s laptops. The 13-inch MacBook Air is still kicking around at $999, but the new 13-inch MacBook Pro, by all rights the proper successor to the 13-inch Air, costs $500 more. A product line that once began at $899 now begins (leaving the Air aside for a moment) at $1299. I’m not sure what solves this one other than time, but it’s an issue. Adam Gutterman: Despite Apple introducing new 2016 MacBook Pro’s last week, I just ordered at 2015 model. Yes, the one that was last updated a year and a half ago. I spent a considerable amount of time looking at the new lineup and thinking through how I intend to use the machine. Ultimately I concluded that in addition to costing several hundreds more, the new models simply offer me less utility than the 2015 models. […] A huge part of my workflow requires that I use a USB security token, and I use USB flash drives a fair amount. I’m not a huge klutz, but I was looking forward to the MagSafe connector. I connect to projectors and large LCDs on a fairly regular basis, so an HDMI port is very useful for me. The thought of having to use dongles all of the time doesn’t appeal to me. Update (2016-11-05): Jacob Kastrenakes (Hacker News, MacRumors): Apple is cutting prices for all of its USB-C adapters following a week of complaints about the MacBook Pro’s inconvenient port situation. […] It’s a sign that Apple recognizes these dongles are a hassle, and it seems to hope that reducing the prices on them will lessen the pain of this transition. Starting immediately, all of Apple’s USB-C adapters and some of its USB-C cables will have their prices cut by $6 to $20[…] John Gruber: I think Apple wants to counter the notion that moving to all USB-C is a money grab — that they did it to make money selling adapters. Colin Cornaby: Before the 2013 Mac Pro, Apple hadn’t upgraded the Mac Pro in three years (and Apple’s neglect of Final Cut Pro 7 didn’t help.) I with video pros at the time and the panic was already setting in. A two year gap, like the one from 2006 to 2008, was digestible. But at three years you start to wonder if the Mac Pro was going to be updated at all. And if you don’t think the Mac Pro is going to be updated, for the good of your business, you’re going to start looking at the Adobe Suite and Windows workstations, and start that transition as early as possible. […] When Apple released the 2013 Mac Pro it never calmed the pro community. The 2013 Mac Pro a risky proposition for businesses because it was slower than Windows hardware, which translates to dollars on the bottom line. A job that takes twice as long to render costs twice as much. And that just continued to feed the narrative that investing in the Apple platform was a risky proposition. And then three years later Apple still hasn’t shipped an upgrade, continuing the tailspin in pro’s confidence of Apple. Marco Arment (tweet, Hacker News): It’s looking increasingly likely that there will never be another Mac Pro. Here’s why that would be a shame. […] Pros wouldn’t be as angry about the limitations of the new MacBook Pro line if there was an alternative that solved their needs. The Mac Pro sweeps up countless edge cases with one product at the top of the line — the only downside is cost, but many pros would rather spend money than compromise on their needs. Just as the Mac’s power lets iOS be simpler, a healthy Mac Pro frees up the rest of the Mac lineup to make more aggressive progress. pavlov: Arment is way too positive on the Mac Pro’s thermal design. Recently I worked on an application where we had about a dozen Mac Pros doing heavy video encoding workloads. Four of these computers started having GPU overheating issues, and turns out that this is a common occurrence on the 2013 Mac Pro. Apple has been quietly replacing units over the years (searching for the specific console error message reveals that it’s common among Mac Pro owners). My theory is that the Mac Pro hasn’t seen an update because Apple knows that its current thermal design is a lemon, and they don’t really want to sell any more of these because the replacement rate is so high. Craig Hockenberry (tweet): Licensing just the operating system was a disaster for Apple. Professional customers don’t have the time to build and maintain their own Hackintoshes. Any partnership to build Mac hardware would need to be structured so that it benefits Apple, the partner, and customer alike. Just like IBM and their clients have benefitted from Lenovo. Keir Thomas: Did you see Louis Rossmann’s YT review? Some USB-C devices kill internet and make the mouse laggy on the new MBP 13in non-Touch Bar. Update (2016-11-06): Jeff Carlson: But like a lot of people, I didn’t order one right away. The 16 GB RAM limit was the first thing to make me pause; my current machine is maxed out at 8 GB and I often hit that ceiling when I’m editing photos and running many applications in the background. […] I still bought one. As I was deliberating, I wrote up the following list of reasons this MacBook Pro, at this time, is the new computer for me. Let me reinforce that this is my situation; I’m not trying to be universal or tell you what to buy. But I thought that posting my thought process might help other people who are also weighing many of the same questions. Aniket Sharma: As someone who had tuned into the event with the singular goal of getting to know more about Apple’s plans for the Mac Mini and iMac, I was left with a very sour taste in my mouth by the time the event ended. Phil, or Tim, should’ve made at least a passing mention to the MacBook Pro’s desktop brethren and told us to hang in there. Jason Snell (Hacker News): And what I like is more travel than these keyboards offer. That said, I want to allay the fears of people who think these keyboards don’t do the job: They do. I find the lack of response in the keys unpleasant, but I can still type at full speed and accuracy when I use it. (I do keep hitting the wrong arrow keys, though. I’m still not a fan of the full-sized left and right arrow keys sharing space with half-height up and down arrows.) In any event, if you like the MacBook keyboard, you’ll liked this one even more. If you disliked the MacBook keyboard, you may find this one to be an improvement—but it’s a progression of that keyboard, not a replacement. Chance Miller: That’s where Griffin’s BreakSafe comes in. It brings MagSafe-like tech to USB-C connections, but there are a few things you should note before running out and purchasing one… See also: Glenn Fleishman (in 2015). Update (2016-11-07): Fred McCann: I think a lot of the anger in the community has more to do with the lack of Mac hardware in general than these specific laptops, but there are some real problems. […] You can pin this on Intel as the kinds of Kaby Lake chips Apple wants aren’t yet available, but the release cycle of MacBook Pros is ultimately on Apple. I know people (myself included) who were waiting for a quad-core latest generation Intel chip in the 2015 MacBook Pro which never came. Apple is charging premium prices for products that will be not entirely outdated, but certainly behind the curve in a short amount of time. […] The old value proposition was you’d invest in as much hardware as you could afford and upgrade later. Apple’s current offerings are already expensive, and outfitting a machine that will go the expected distance is even more so. The combination of limited and expensive options for memory and storage dramatically alters the value proposition of the MacBook Pro over the lifetime of the computer. John Gruber: I’ve been thinking for a long time that of course Apple is “soon” going to reboot the Mac Pro. Now I’m starting to worry they’re not. They don’t have to, but they really should. Make it fast, make it quiet, and make it easy to keep updating with CPU and GPU speed bumps every year or so. John Paczkowski: 256GB base in a Pro laptop is silly. So is demanding an additional $200 to get it to 512 where it should be (at very least). Update (2016-11-08): John Gruber: This isn’t a new comment. This was posted 4 years ago, in response to the last major MacBook Pro redesign. Déjà vu. David Owens II: Is the point that Apple continues to push sub-pro hardware to us and we continue to buy it because there’s no better alternative? Vlad Savov: These are Apple’s premium laptops, its deluxe devices, but not in any meaningful way computers tailored for the pros. A MacBook Pro is now simply what you buy if you’re in the Apple ecosystem and have a higher budget and expectations than the MacBook can fulfill. […] The Mac community finds the specs underwhelming, even on the 15-inch model, which uses power-sipping AMD Radeon graphics instead of the world-conquering Nvidia Pascal chips. Dave Mark: My hope is that Apple has a new, upgradeable Mac Pro in the works. My worry is that they don’t. Stephen Hackett: Out of respect, I think Apple should give their pro users an olive branch here. If the Mac Pro is going to stick around, then the company should have an answer to Marco’s complaints. If there is something in the pipeline, the company should tip its hand a little. I can’t imagine sales of the Mac Pro are good anymore, so I don’t this would be a big hit on the bottom line. See also: Upgrade. Sam Mallery has a contrary perspective on MagSafe (tweet). Jonathan Zdziarski (via John Gruber): I fired up a bunch of apps and projects (more than I’d ever work on at one time) in every app I could possibly think of on my MacBook Pro. These included apps you’d find professional photographers, designers, software engineers, penetration testers, reverse engineers, and other types running – and I ran them all at once, and switched between them, making “professionally-type-stuff” happen as I go. […] The result? I ran out of things to do before I ever ran out of RAM. I only ever made it to 14.5GB before the system decided to start paging out, so I didn’t even have the change to burn up all that delicious RAM. I found this surprising because on a normal day I run fewer apps than that and yet frequently see lots of page outs. On Sunday I rebooted, did some light work (no Xcode, VMware, or Lightroom) and by early evening had 17 GB of swap. And when I do use those apps, it sounds like I work with smaller photo files than he does, and usually only one virtual machine at a time. Susie Ochs: I can type on both just fine, but I’m not a fan of this style—every time I had to switch back to my MacBook Air for a few minutes, its old keyboard felt better immediately. With the MacBook Pro’s new keyboard, I find myself typing extra hard, like my brain isn’t convinced the keys are even going to go down unless I really pound them. For what it’s worth, I don’t have this problem with Apple’s wireless Smart Keyboard. […] Putting it to the test in Geekbench 4.0.1, this stock, entry-level MacBook Pro racked up a score of 3765 in the single-core CPU test, and 7316 in the multicore test, both at 64-bit. But that single-core score is just 1 percent better than the entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro from early 2015 (2.7GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 with 8GB of RAM), and the multicore score is better by 4 percent. Becky Hansmeyer: Looks like I’m six for six! (except the key travel did change, but ehhh I’ll get used to it.) Also, one of my “dream big” requests was for a bigger trackpad with Pencil support, so I guess you could even say I got six and a half of my wishes. Rene Ritchie: When Apple made Mac Pro an appliance, like iPad and MacBook Air before it, Apple took on the responsibility for keeping it updated. If I can no longer upgrade the graphics, RAM, or drives, it’s their job to do it for me, consistently and reliably, or to over-communicate why the roadmap might be longer. […] I didn’t buy the rev A modern Mac Pro, but I fully intended to buy the rev B. It just never came. Not a year later, not two years later, and now not three years later. It might come next spring but no one outside Apple really knows for sure. And that creates an incredible amount of stress and anxiety in the community. Stress and anxiety they don’t deserve. Update (2016-11-09): Aaron L’Heureux: I want to talk to some of the FUD that has led to a number of complaints, but first there are certainly a few areas where Apple could have done better and helped curb some of the unrest. […] In order to prove that this future is the right future, Apple and third parties need to knock the functionality of the Touch Bar out of the park. I’m not worried about the decision for all USB-C. I think we will find in the coming years that the all USB-C lifestyle will reduce peripheral complexity and make life actually easier. But for now, we’re in that transition phase. Colm Mulhall: Macs were never cheap, but I think at this price point, Apple has raised the bar to a price point that just can’t be justified by many people, myself included. Update (2016-11-10): Jason Snell: It’s not quite a price hike, but it’s an elimination of the least expensive option. And combined with the price hikes internationally due to the stronger dollar, it’s got a lot of people crying foul. This makes me wonder: To what degree are Retina Macs more expensive because the Retina display (and the increased graphics power required to drive them) adds to the cost of making the device, and to what degree is it a feature differentiator that Apple feels it can use as a way to get people to spend more money? Update (2016-11-11): Benjamin Mayo: Windows manufacturers don’t seem to have a problem selling laptops with ‘Retina’ resolution displays far below the Air’s $999 retail price. They may not be as good as the new MacBook Pro or iMac displays but they are leaps and beyonds ahead of what the Air has. hot2 is unable to get the new MacBook Pro to work with Linux (via Hacker News). Update (2016-11-12): John Gordon: Retina is for the young. Update (2016-11-13): See also: Accidental Tech Podcast. Update (2016-11-14): John Gruber: Most common question about Touch Bar: does the blank spot to the left of Esc work as a touch target. Answer: half of it does. Jacob Kastrenakes: There really is a lot of good stuff here. But for every smart use of the Touch Bar, there’s another that’s too complicated or entirely meaningless. Often they’re even within the same app, all present on the Touch Bar at once. […] The difference between a menu opening left or right or up or down may seem slight, but the effect is very disorienting. There were times I felt lost in the Touch Bar, unable to return to the screen I wanted. […] Having those menu options exposed so clearly can be helpful at times — I’m bad at finding formulas in Keynote, for instance, and the Touch Bar makes them easy to access — but mostly it’s not. These apps don’t need more menus; they need better context for people just starting out in them, and a streamlined way for experienced users to get stuff done. […] “While editing in Final Cut, I used the Touch Bar exactly zero times,” Nielsen says. “When I tried to intentionally use the Touch Bar, I felt like a kid learning how to type again. I had to keep looking down at the bar instead of looking at the images I was actually trying to edit. That could get better with time, but it seems harder since there aren’t any actual keys for my fingers to find if I was just editing along not looking at my hands.” Brian X. Chen: The Touch Bar is a breeze to get the hang of, but I didn’t find it helpful in streamlining tasks. If you open the Photos app, for example, the Touch Bar displays thumbnails of photos in your library, and you can tap one to select a photo to edit. That’s neat, but why not just select the photo on your laptop screen? When using the Safari browser, you can use the Touch Bar to select a different browser tab — but using keyboard shortcuts (Command+1 to choose the first tab, for instance) is quicker. […] In speed tests run with the app Geekbench 4, the 15-inch MacBook Pro’s computer processor was only 10 percent to 17 percent faster than the 15-inch model released in 2012. Yet the graphics processor, which is crucial for heavy computing tasks, in the new MacBook Pro is about twice as fast as the one in the older model, and the storage drives are much faster, too. Jason Snell: Every ten clicks or so, the MacBook Pro’s trackpad would simply “miss” one of my clicks. This is something I haven’t experienced on my desktop Magic Trackpad, which clicks reliably. At first I thought I was interfering with the trackpad somehow, perhaps inadvertently touching my shirt to the bottom edge or laying my palm onto the surface. But it wasn’t any of those, so far as I could tell. Whatever the reason, it’s not fun to have your laptop miss clicks. It slows everything down. I hope this is a bug in the software that Apple can address in an update, because it’s a real bummer. The old hinge-style trackpad on my MacBook Air might not be fancy, but it never let me down. Rene Ritchie: The potential unlocked by all of it is enormous. But they’ve got graphics that, while they can run dual 5K displays at the high end, can’t run VR or the highest end games. They’ve got a 16 GB memory limit that, while mitigated by compression and SSD speed, won’t prove enough for the most demanding professionals. They’ve got Touch Bar and Touch ID but not a touch screen, and there’s no option for anything but Apple’s incredibly flat, incredibly divisive new keyboard. And they’re priced at a significant premium. What this means to you will depend entirely on your personal preferences and professional requirements. For some, the new MacBook Pro will be absolute, heart-crushing deal breakers. For others, like me, they’ll be absolutely terrific and once again deliver on the future, right now, today. Walt Mossberg: The biggest surprise in my tests was just how inconsistent the Touch Bar Pro’s battery life was. I have tested hundreds of laptops over the years and Macs have almost always excelled at meeting or beating their promised battery lives, both in my longtime battery test regime, and in typical daily use. But the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar wasn’t as reliably consistent as previous Macs. […] Alas, although I wrote this whole column on a MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, I couldn’t use this predictive text feature because I was writing in Google Docs running in a Safari tab. That’s right: while text entry in any number of web pages works with the Touch Bar, it fails with one of the world’s most widely used web apps. Jim Dalrymple: I know that having 16GB RAM is a concern for some people, but you could never put more than 16GB RAM in a MacBook Pro, so I don’t get the problem. Pros and other customers have been successfully using these computers for years. Just because it takes more RAM to use a Windows machine effectively, that doesn’t mean the same thing for a Mac. You have to look at the entire picture, hardware, software, system software, and memory optimizations. It’s simple: I’ve been hitting the limit for years, and I’m tired of not being able to do certain things at once, of having to keep rebooting my Mac when performance grinds to a halt. And if you look at what I do, I don’t even think I’m that much of a pro. There are adapters that will allow you to plug in everything you need. […] I know that’s another source of frustration for users, but it will only be a frustration until the devices we use come with USB-C by default. There is no adapter that can provide the internal secondary storage that the SD slot could. Troy Gaul: Was setting up my new MacBook Pro when I realized that its L key doesn’t work consistently. Pressing it doesn’t always produce a letter. See also: 9to5Mac, MacRumors. Battery Life Craig Federighi Hackintosh Jonathan Ive Keyboard Mac Mac Pro MacBook Pro MagSafe Phil Schiller RAM Retina Thunderbolt Tim Cook Top Posts Touch Bar USB-C 243 Comments 243 Comments David Magda October 27, 2016 10:42 PM I actually e-mailed Phil Schiller about the RAM, and he replied saying that to "put more than 16GB of fast RAM into a notebook design at this time would require a memory system that consumes much more power and wouldn’t be efficient enough for a notebook." I generally agree that more RAM would be appropriate for a "Pro" machine: at least 32, if not 64 GB. Lenovo's P-series can reach 64GB with the P50. MacBook Pros have had a maximum of 16 GB for a few years now, and it's getting silly IMHO: * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Pro Michael Tsai October 28, 2016 12:02 AM @David Yeah, I really don’t care about the power. My MacBook Pro is plugged in most of the time, and there are also external battery packs. (Sidenote: Since I use an external keyboard, the Touch Bar would be wasted.) I’ve been hitting limits (e.g. 10+ GB of swap and the dialog about running out of memory) with 16 GB for a few years now. If the next Mac lasts as long as this one, that would mean I’d still have 16 GB in 2020. James October 28, 2016 1:12 AM Thanks for summarizing my thoughts and concerns. I came to the table today ready to eat and I'm leaving hungry. Being on a 3-4 year cycle and willing to invest in my tools, I just can't spend "pro" money on a machine with 16GB of RAM with the expectation of it carrying me into 2020. - Typed on my 2013 MBP - Jon H October 28, 2016 1:24 AM "would require a memory system that consumes much more power and wouldn’t be efficient enough for a notebook..." The unstated part of this: "... that is thinner and lighter than anyone really wanted it to be". There wouldn't be a problem with more than 16GB if Apple would chill out on prioritizing thinness and lightness over everything else across the product line. Adam October 28, 2016 2:07 AM The only reduction that would even remotely interest me is to remove the screen and keyboard and create a mini-like device I could easily carry from place to place, plugging into a desktop keyboard and monitor. Because while the Apple trackpad is easily the best, the keyboard is far from it, and even the 15" screen is far too small when you get used to working at 2560x1440 or even higher. Today's announcement is nothing I am interested in - especially not a flat gimmicky area for apps to show me their special controls, that costs me a key that should always be available, ESC. 16GB RAM is ridiculous and the power consumption argument does not ring true. I'll be building an i7 desktop in the next month or so, probably still installing OS X - too bad Apple won't sell me a machine up to 2016 standards or they would get my money, but I have waited too long for this update to compromise as far as they demand. As for not being able to plug this year's iPhone into this year's MacBook Pro without buying an extra dongle, that's just insulting. Look out for purpose-built MacBook Pro bags with space for the sixteen dongles you'll need to carry at all times... Roy October 28, 2016 2:17 AM Aside from not mentioning desktop Macs (where I spend most of my time due to ergonomic needs), two major things bothered me about the updated MBPs: 1) Apple is keeping the 2015 base models around, but at the same price as they were before. At least when older iPhone models are kept around, the price drops year-over-year. 2) The carried-over $1299 13" MBP has a 2.7GHz Broadwell chip. To get a Skylake MBP with a similar CPU spec (2.9GHz), you now have to pay $1799... since the $1499 MBP is now only 2.0GHz. Put another way, the CPU for the $1499 MBP has gone down from 2.7GHz to 2.0 GHz year-over-year. Roy October 28, 2016 2:38 AM I just noticed that the Mac Pro link goes to a tweet by someone using a Hackintosh. I ran a Hackintosh from 2012-2015. It was by far the most enjoyable macOS experience I've had: more stable than any of the real Macs I've had. Even though it was a desktop tower, the system was quieter than my Mac mini. I ended up replacing it with a used 2010 Mac Pro once El Capitan was released because installing the OS required new utilities that weren't code-signed like the old utilities were. Since I intend to make software for others, I thought it was appropriate to make my build system as 'clean' as possible by getting a real Mac and not relying on unsigned utilities to install the OS. I'm not sure if the situation has changed with Sierra, but I thought it was something worth mentioning for developers who might consider a Hackintosh. And just for comparison, I have the sides of my Mac Pro wrapped in blankets and pillows to attenuate the noise... and it's still not as quiet as my Hackintosh was. Even still, it's the last Mac Apple made which makes sense for how I use a computer. Rui Carmo October 28, 2016 3:05 AM First thing I did after the keynote was download Elementary OS and install it on my old Toshiba C720 chromebook to get a feel for how far it's come in the past year. On this decrepit hardware, it flies. I'm now looking for a XHIDPI laptop what can run Linux and that isn't an eyesore (I already have a Lenovo X1 from work, but thoroughly dislike it), but on the short term (I.e., Christmas) will be deciding whether to build a Hackintosh or just buy a decent, quiet desktop PC that can drive dual 4K and run Elementary on it as well. It's going to be painful to wean myself off the fifteen years of miscellaneous software licenses I have for brilliant third-party software, but my focus these days is on cloud arch and systems development plus the occasional web/mobile app, and for that I only need vim (yeah, I'm one of those guys), a browser, and the occasional dip into an IDE (which I can always run inside a VM). Yeah, it's going to be rough, and frustrating, and I see myself having to put up with Android too eventually. But at least I won't have to put up with my six-year-old Mac mini anymore, be able to upgrade without waiting years, and have an acceptable cost/performance ratio. Full disclosure: I've been a Microsoft employee for a year now. I am not, however, interested in running Windows at home because my personal commitment to computing is to do it on UNIX (if only because I need to take in a different viewpoint and keep work separate from my own projects). Apple is making it hard to do so on decent hardware. Colin October 28, 2016 3:10 AM Apple once said, "customers want what we don't have". It was about the iPhone, you can now apply this to the Mac. dpx October 28, 2016 6:33 AM Touch Bar is ergonomic catastrophe. Tiny flat screen hidden behind the keys -- at the event all the people demonstrating Touch Bar had to stand, lean over keyboard and crouch in order to use it. Doing that while sitting and doing some serious work is usability nightmare. David Magda October 28, 2016 8:41 AM @Michael: E-mail Phil Schiller and the other suits at Apple; make a commotion. The squeaky wheel gets the grease. Ruffin October 28, 2016 2:01 PM @Roy "Put another way, the CPU for the $1499 MBP has gone down from 2.7GHz to 2.0 GHz year-over-year." That's really on the money. This is not a truck, to borrow from Jobs. Or, if this is a truck, Apple built the wrong one. The 2016 MacBook Pros are more Chevy SSR than Ford F-150. Adrian B October 28, 2016 2:02 PM I’ve been a Mac user for over 25 years and I’ve always felt that the over-negative knee jerk reaction after announcements are from people who don’t know what they’re talking about, the don’t understand Apple nor their customers. (Sometimes they didn’t even understand or accept basic physical laws of reality, like when some people argued that Apple just had to put a G5 in the PowerBook.) But this time, I’m disappointed too. It’s been a growing feeling ever since the started to weld RAM and SSD, ending a long-time tradition of upgrading Mac laptops to give them new life. It used to be the case that if you didn’t have the money to buy the maxed-out version of a new laptop you could at least buy the budget version and upgrade yourself when prices had fallen enough. It so frustrating that you either have to pay those ridiculous upgrade prices up front or buy the budget version and suffer from it, for the entire lifetime of the product. Some of use just can’t afford the upgrades, and after yesterdays announcement with the price hike, hardly afford a MacBook Pro at all. It’s a bit of a stretch, but the new MacBook Pro is almost like a fancier version of the MacBook, rather than a functional tool for the professional user. (And don’t even get me started on what happened to the by far best software Apple has ever made aside for the OS, that was in limbo for years and then discontinued… no, Photos is not a good replacement.) Stefan S October 28, 2016 9:43 PM It's funny how Apple loves its iOS line but forgets what builds the apps that run on it. Most iOS apps are built on Macs. They are effectively limiting iOS developer efficiency by not producing professional grade Macs. I can't believe 16GB is still the max on the new MBPs. Keep them a little thicker and allow up to 64GB along with a much faster i7 and a keyboard with proper key travel. Perhaps the rumor of a tech bump to the desktop Macs happening at the end of November is true but if it does happen, it will probably be just as disappointing. Chucky October 28, 2016 11:43 PM "Even Cook questioned why anyone would buy a personal computer instead of an iPad Pro, saying in an interview last year, “Why would you buy a PC anymore? No really, why would you buy one?” Cook didn’t answer our question about that." Look, the man understands supply chains. He's good at supply chains. You want him to understand everything? (Also, where's the gratitude for not ditching the screen and keyboard. Give thanks for the little details.) ----- More seriously, the part I find fascinating are the professional non-tech writers and reporters who just can't stop lambasting this whole thing. The exact same kind of folks who disparaged Microsoft 10 to 15 years ago are disparaging Apple today. I dunno if Apple cares, but, maybe they should? Thomas October 29, 2016 3:02 AM They killed the Pro-line. Pro is only a marketing differentiator for the bigger MacBooks. All slim tiny light no connectors and basic features (16 and 256). Upgrade prices are way to high. But the pro models should start with at least 512. Seems they are 2 years late spec wise like with the 32 iPhones.

I'm a developer who works in coffee shops a lot, and I appreciate the battery life, the weight, and especially the brighter screen. I think people really underestimate the value of a good screen for working. With a better screen, text can be smaller AND more readable. Also, I think the touch bar will be very convenient because I don't really use the function keys much. Have access to common functions within finger reach is handy. Another benefit is the faster SSD storage. This makes a difference in app responsiveness and helps to lessen the effect of less RAM. Even the loss of magsafe is compensated for by being able to plug in on either side. I am mystified that they didn't include a lightning port instead of the headphone jack. It's really odd that my new iPhone 7 headphones won't plug into my new MBP, especially after the talk of courage and all. Chuck Toporek October 29, 2016 1:11 PM The more I think about it, Apple should Open Source macOS. Too many developers have taken the path of building a Hackintosh, anyway, so let's admit this is the new reality if you want a real Mac desktop system. When Apple announced the iPad Pro, Tim Cook called it a ”desktop-class“ device more than a couple times. It’s clear now that is the future of the Mac in their eyes, but to the rest of us, an iPad Pro just isn't capable enough to do all of thing things that the majority of us Mac users need to do. Stephen B October 29, 2016 1:39 PM Actions need to agree with words. If you stand up and say how much the Mac is part of your soul but your actions so far declare that the Mac is just a iPad with an attached keyboard, your actions and words are inconsistent. Peter Flynn October 29, 2016 1:57 PM I was poised to consider a new Mac but instead it looks like I'll go for a Dell with Ubuntu and Enlightenment. I blogged a while back about a roomful of devs at a conference all using Macs where once they would have been PCs; now it seems we may be on the way back. Tytus Suski October 29, 2016 2:58 PM Cognitive load imposed by the new Apple laptops line-up is enormous. Having to navigate through high prices, dongle planning, keyboard setups differences, and outdated guts on basic models is very anti usual Apple's philosophy. Additionally, there's a suspicion that the only right moment to buy is now, since specs will not be updated for a long time. For people with multimedia servers based on Mac minis due for an upgrade, there are even more headaches. Why not just s***** it, and go Microsoft, then.

Thanks. Juan October 30, 2016 3:13 PM There's always hackintosh http://www.hackintosh.com Benjamin Kang October 30, 2016 7:13 PM It seems like Apple trying to mass-produce "innovation" by following a checklist with the mandatory thinner, lighter, and new experience checkboxes. This may work for consumer grade devices like iPhone's and iPads, but I don't think it is the right way for the MacBook Pro. What pro users want is a adequately portable powerhouse laptop that can transform into a full-fledged, high-compute workstation when plugged in to power. The existing MacBook Pros are already portable enough, so why not just: - Make quad core i7's available to even the 13" form factor - Make the latest Nvidia mobile GPUs available to even the 13" form factor. - Make 32Gb and 64Gb of RAM an option For the issue of battery life, they can use some aggressive undervolting and underclocking when not plugged into power. I am truly appalled that even the best 13" MacBook Pro processor option, which is a dual core i7, is just 37% faster than the dual core i7 in my 2012 11" MacBook Air. Even with such a meagre increase, the MacBook Pro will cost nearly 4k, while the MacBook Air was around 2k.

Tim O'Reilly spoke at the 2002 WWDC conference on the topic: * http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2002/05/14/oreilly_wwdc_keynote.html Seems that they're saying not good things about the Mac ecosystem.

He's such a genius, seriously. OK, if he really believes the bulls**t about nobody needed a PC any more, take away the laptops of all Apple employees in Cupertino and force them to only use iPad Pros.

Chucky October 31, 2016 5:04 PM "Steve Jobs needs to be resurrected, or at the very least summoned to a design workshop in the near future. Corporate necromancers should send their resumes to Mr. Cook." Be careful at what stage you resurrect Steve-o. Even before his death, in the last several years of his illness, his judgment seemed to become more and more unreliable. The top example of this is naming Tim Cook to be his successor. After all, who was Tim Cook? A supply chain genius who most definitely wasn't a product guy. As the famous Steve-o quote goes: "I have my own theory about why the decline happens at companies like IBM or Microsoft. The company does a great job, innovates and becomes a monopoly or close to it in some field, and then the quality of the product becomes less important. The product starts valuing the great salesmen, because they're the ones who can move the needle on revenues, not the product engineers and designers. So the salespeople end up running the company." We just need to change that quote to replace "salesmen" to "supply chain guys", and we can see the later stage ill Steve-o disregarding his own correct insights. So, resurrect the mid-90's to mid-00's Steve, and not the one who had lost the thread due to illness. Then, not only could he re-prioritize, but he could also name a product guy as his successor... Scott Roland October 31, 2016 5:38 PM I work in the EDA industry, designing computer chips. Most of the real work is done with tools that run in Linux. That means I spend a lot of time running a Linux VM or connecting to a remote Linux server, often full screen. I actually use the function keys, and use the fn key for when I want brightness or volume control. I can touch type the function keys and the Escape key, which should properly be directly in the upper left corner. So I would actively prefer real function keys over the Touch Bar. When running a VM, it is useful to have lots of memory, lots of hard drive space, and a beefy CPU. None of the MacBook Pros support 32GB of memory, purportedly because Apple felt that thinness and battery life was a higher priority. Only the low-end MacBook Pro comes with the real function keys. I use an external clicky keyboard when I can. I would prefer a thicker laptop with a keyboard with lots of key travel and responsiveness over the new thin design. When I'm not doing work on the machine, I like to process the photos from my DLSR camera with an SD card. I have headphones on most of the time; if I had to choose between a laptop with a headphone port or a SDXC slot I would choose the latter. I'm looking to replace a 4.5 pound 23" MacBook Pro from 2009 (heavier than normal because I replaced the DVD drive with an extra hard drive for more space). If I had to choose today it would be the 2015 form-factor Retina 13” for the SDXC slot, better keyboard, real function keys, and faster CPU. Sadly, that is the machine Apple appears to be trying to phase out.

JBS October 31, 2016 9:46 PM Thanks for this great roundup. I want to push back on an assumption made often in this context, and made in several of the blurbs above, that there are two types of computer users: serious professionals (who need tons of memory, expandability, etc.) and coffee shop weenies (who need nothing, but like pretty logos). Maybe this was true of the Mac user base 15 years ago, but it is not true of the broader PC user base, and no longer true of the Mac subset of that user base. In fact, there are many many "professionals" who use their computers as critical tools for important work, and who do place serious demands on those computers, but do not require leading edge processing power and will never install an aftermarket component. These are lawyers, doctors, sales people, managers, journalists, small business owners, and the rest of the white collar world who are neither engineers or creatives. These people require portability, reliability, access to enterprise applications, and other considerations. And I would wager they are the largest segment of the Mac user base. The new (as of last year) MacBook is a brilliant computer for these people (I am one, I own a MacBook, it is perfect) as the Air was in its time. Many in the tech crowd grossly misunderstands this market, as witnessed by the screaming about the lack of ports. These customers don't care about ports, believe me. All that said, I am in complete agreement with the criticisms of the new MacBook Pro, because it seem like an overpowered version of the MacBook for the same audience that the MacBook already serves. As a shareholder and long time fan of Apple, I am pretty disappointed, because I think there are important business reasons to continue to serve the engineering and design markets, and I think the refusal to address that market with an updated Mac Pro, updated pro apps, etc, is misguided. But the criticism that Apple is selling "toys" for "children" is at least as misguided. Kendall Gelner October 31, 2016 9:49 PM I see what people are saying but I think a lot of the dislike is misplaced. People are just quicker and quicker with negative hot takes on everything year after year... For one thing even the GPU link you posted is wrong. People are comparing an older GPU design against what Apple is actually shipping, the specs of which are unknown. The only thing I'm a bit unhappy about is the 16GB memory limitation, but even there did everyone suddenly forget that Mavericks introduced memory compression? I have a late 2013 MacBook Pro, and frankly I am looking forward to the update (I usually update every three years or so). I think everyone should calm down and do takes based on what is shipping, not what people THINK is shipping (just look at hoe much misinformation around the ESC key has spread). Maybe some of that is on Apple for not being crystal clear on how things would work, but a lot of it rests on the Hot Take culture of today... Will October 31, 2016 10:21 PM Sadly, I noticed Apple's missed vision when they released the last Mac Mini. I so wanted this to be mid range powerhouse something quad-core with an i7, but it didn't come close to that. Then what seemed so odd, so off track was when the ram was soldered to the motherboard. This was absurd to me. Never in the history of my Mac life did a desktop have this. It was the first nail in the coffin. At that point I knew something wasn't right and so far it appears that the poweruser is being squeezed out of the equation, and we were those who cared most about Apple. I'm left wondering "How much can you polish a diamond before it turns into dust?" Matt October 31, 2016 10:31 PM For a press conference that was supposed to be all about the Mac, why did Apple completely ignore the Mac's we need? Mac Pro, iMac, Mac Mini. We are waiting to buy all three. We do not need or want laptops. We need desktop power. Michael Tsai October 31, 2016 10:31 PM @Kendall Yes, everyone who has been running into memory limitations for the last few years has been doing so in spite of memory compression. Simeon October 31, 2016 10:48 PM I really like the new MacBook Pros and I've been using my 2012 rMBP professionally every day since I got it. Doing 2D and 3D graphics, development, and video editing. I don't need more CPU speed and I don't need more GPU power. I want a machine that's easier to carry and has far better battery life — and is at least as fast as my current one. (Also the wide-gamut display, it was the only thing tempting me towards the iMac 5K.) I drain my newly replaced MBP battery in ~1.5 hours of work, I hope this new one will give me at least 4 hours of work before I have to find power. Simeon October 31, 2016 10:59 PM I don't get the hate for these machines. I've used my 2012 MBP professionally every day since I got it. For Xcode, Photoshop, Final Cut Pro, Affinity Designer, and so on. It's more than fast enough to build the projects I need to build, and it does it in a form factor that I can carry around. I've built several products start-to-finish on this machine and they've been creative, fun, and have generated serious income. Speed has not been an issue. The new machine is attractive because it might let me work longer (I drain my newly-replace-battery 2012 MBP in 1.5 hours of taxing work), with a lighter thing to carry around, and a better (wide gamut) screen. Seems like a great upgrade. Jason Murray October 31, 2016 11:39 PM After 20 years of using a Mac my new computer of this year is a Hackintosh. It made me appreciate the incredible engineering effort that goes into a Mac. But I didn't want to spent 4000$ on 3 year old hardware for a MacPro. Craig Jacobs October 31, 2016 11:42 PM I'm very disappointed as well, but I absolutely hate windows. Looks like a few weekends building a couple of hackintoshes for me. David Puranen November 1, 2016 1:24 AM Back in 2011 I was able to get the best 13 inch MacBook Pro with an i7 for $1600 Canadian. Today getting a MacBook Pro with an i7 (that won't have to clock itself down quickly) with 16 gigs of RAM will cost me over $3000. That's kind of insane. I really hope that Apple can quickly begin moving their laptops over to their own ARM chips. I imagine they'll still price them insanely high, Tim Cook seems really focused on making people think their products are good because they're expensive, not just because they're good. (The state of their Pro, now prosumer software makes that clear.) I honestly am at a loss for why Apple is doing things the way they are. The MacBook should already be on the A10 Fusion Developers should already be tweaking their code for the new instruction set. I imagine Apple could shave off a thousand dollars from the cost of the current MacBooks and still maintain awesome margins by using their A series chips. I've already moved away from Adobe and towards Affinity's products for most of my graphic work. I'd readily buy a MacBook that was thin, light and had a good sized SSD that still allowed for things like torrenting. Intel's chips are at a stand still, and Apple seriously needs to get the ball moving on their own chips for their Macs. (They also need to either drop the pro name or start putting in options that pros actually care about.)

Hamranhansenhansen November 1, 2016 7:21 AM After 10 years of touch, the users have changed. If Apple were still starting at the user and designing outward, then the Mac hardware should have dramatically changed too. But instead the 2017 lineup is just the 2007 lineup with speed bumps and all the components glued down. The 2017 MacBook Pro just teleported in from an alternate universe with no iPads and iPhones. Making MacBook Pro thinner never helped me because it is a portable desktop. I have to plug in a giant graphics tablet just to begin to work. What I need is a MacPad that would enable me to drop the notebook entirely — 100% thinner! — and just carry the MacPad instead of the graphics tablet. Yes, iPad Pro is great, but it only runs half my tools, and not the half that I specifically get paid to use, with a pen, for 20 years now. The biggest trend in pro graphics is not iPad Pro — it is that your Wacom tablet now comes with a Windows PC in it so you just login to Creative Cloud and start working without a notebook or desktop hanging off the tablet like a dongle. For me, the Mac lineup should look more like this: - MacBook — world’s thinnest and lightest PC notebook (for writers, business people, others) - MacBook Pro — world’s most powerful and configurable PC notebook (for coders, scientists, others) - MacPad — world’s best PC tablet with Apple Pencil (for creative pros) - iMac — the world’s best PC display, works standalone via multitouch, or add optional keyboard, mouse, trackpad, Apple Pencil, or all of the above (for everyone) - Mac Pro — a desktop dock that plugs into any Mac via Thunderbolt to exponentially increase your available CPU and GPU at the cost of being stuck on AC power (for super high-performance users) I would literally go tomorrow and buy a MacPad and an iMac if the above were the lineup, but as it is, my hot-rodded Classic MacBook Pro with gigantic SSD cannot be beat by any Mac at Apple Store right now. 81 reasons (and counting) to hate the new MacBooks | Philip Elmer‑DeWitt November 1, 2016 7:27 AM […] Excerpted from Michael Tsai’s master list of grievances… […] Narg November 1, 2016 8:13 AM I was saying that Apple lost it's way with it's users when they released an iPhone sans audio jack.

Everything about them is perfect for a photographer on the go - wider gamut and brighter screen, lighter body, longer battery life. Come to think of it, what filed of "creative professionals" are these really not good for? The only group of people I see who could really use increased specs over what is offered are programmers - and indeed they seem to be the ones whining most vociferously. But even there, I am a full-time developer and I see this as a a decent update - I would have liked more RAM but 16GB has been fine for the last three years for the most part, and going forward I'm pretty sure I will appreciate the battery life more than I will miss extra RAM.

In moltissimi si stanno lamentando delle nuove macchine, per motivi diversi: Dj, fotografi, sviluppatori e creativi, che dovranno […] DJ November 1, 2016 12:46 PM This level of backlash is completely baffling to me. As a longtime IT professional (system admin and developer), I’ve been extremely happy with the performance and reliability of my Macs (Mac Pro (2013 cylinder), 15” MBP (mid-2012)). I’m due for replacements for both, so I’m a little disappointed that there isn’t a newer option for the Mac Pro yet. But the new MBP seems like it will be a great upgrade for me. The 16 GB memory limit on the current MBP hasn’t been an issue, even with large Xcode projects, large databases, or the admittedly-too-many web pages that I like to keep open in Safari. And how much faster is the Skylake i7 going to be over the Ivy Bridge i7 that I have now, even at the same 2.7 GHz clock speed? From what I’ve seen, the Touch Bar is going to be great. Custom interface elements for different apps? Yes, please. Escape and traditional F keys are going to be mapped there when it makes sense, so worrying that those have somehow been “taken away” is silly. You could argue that you really prefer the physical keys, but that’s more of a personal preference, ranked right up there with the clickety-clack of traditional, full-travel keyboard keys. I use escape in Terminal (sys admin -> vi), and some other F keys when I happen to run a Windows VM, but I’ll bet they’ll still be there in Terminal and Fusion when I need them. The big takeaway right now is that most people haven’t even seen or tried the new models yet, nor have they seen what app developers are going to do with the Touch Bar in their apps. I think I want to wait and see before calling for a “nuke and pave” on the whole Mac line. chiara boeri November 1, 2016 1:04 PM Terrible! I've been working with Mac for more than 25 years. This is not a PC. This is NOT for professionals. Impossible even to think buying one, regardless of the price, which anyway is to high for such a toy. BCG November 1, 2016 1:05 PM As a longtime Mac user (since a 1991 LC II) who is NOT a video editor, programmer, graphic artist, etc even I am super disappointed by the new MacBook "Pro". I'm typing this on the last Mac I bought, a mid-2009 15" MBP 2.53 Ghz. If I recall correctly, this configuration was the 2nd best speed offered at the time and I paid $1700 for it shortly after the 2010 models were released. Now even the lowest config of the 15" MBP is $2400 yet it comes with LESS, except for the Retina screen. No optical drive. No Ethernet. No SD Card reader. No regular USB. No FireWire. No video out. No matte screen option. I've used the Ethernet, SD reader, USB, and FireWire all in the past couple weeks and I'm not even a "Pro" user. I'll admit FireWire is old and I rarely use CD/DVD anymore, but Ethernet, USB, and SD are all still valid ports that many many people use frequently at home and at work. Thankfully this machine still runs great, especially after I replaced the hard drive with an SSD 4 years ago. I'd like to upgrade it, but not to a machine that is more expensive (aren't technological things supposed to get cheaper or at least stay the same price over time?) and would require that I either invest in a lot of dongles or dump all the other devices that I use like my backup FireWire drives. What would it cost for Apple to keep some of these ports? $15 per MBP? Maybe make it 1 mm thicker? Could you imagine the CPU - RAM - Battery powerhouse MBP they could build now in 2016 if they kept the dimensions of a 2009 MBP? I've never once thought "this machine is too big / heavy, I wish I didn't buy it". I bought it because it had everything I needed and the price was right. Now my only choice is to buy something that doesn't have what I need, plus a glossy screen that reflects everything, and a mushy keyboard, with a thinness factor that doesn't matter to me at all, for $2400 + $$$ dongles at the low end. That's getting close to 1990s Mac pricing. Yeah, no thanks. I'm keeping this 7 year old MBP until it dies, and Apple can keep wondering why their Mac sales are in a slump. They used to innovate Macs year after year. Now we're lucky just to get minor speed bumps every year on some of the Mac line. There was a time when every year or two I would think I would "need" a new Mac because the innovation and speed upgrades and everything else was so strong compared to previous models. Now Mac has become so stagnant it's sad (?) to realize that I'm trucking along just fine on a 7 year old machine with no real desire to upgrade.

The irony is that Steve Jobs was very aware of this problem, as you can from his famous quote I posted upthread. Daniel November 1, 2016 2:22 PM This post started out quite interesting but further down I found quotes from a couple of posts that I read already. And the quote would always be the part that expressed the most disdain for the MBP and Apples direction, even if the quoted article as a whole had a different tone. That makes me question why this should be the go to article for "the state of the Mac". Clearly you are not satisfied with the new MBP and that is understandable, but you often seem to cut and paste to make your point rather than to represent the different takes some authors offer. Obviously I will have to read more of your sources, though this post itself have probably shaped a not insignificant part of the later discussion. CR November 1, 2016 3:18 PM As an Apple ][ and ][+ user who has had many Macs since the 128k Mac, I too am disappointed by these "updates." Our 2011 17" MBP is working fine. It is now upgraded with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. Our 2012 Mac Mini has 16GB RAM, and (now) a 1TB SSD. Pre-announcement, we were seriously considering replacing the 17" and the 2012 Mac Mini (16GB RAM too) with new 2016 Skylake MBPs. We were going to get a large new thunderbolt 4K or 5K monitor (to replace the 2004 30 inch Cinema Display). Not any more. The new machines may be marginally faster, but don't offer more RAM. We keep the computers for 6-8 years since we take good care of them and they usually are quite reliable (shoot, we have a Powerbook 520c that still boots fine, as does the "Fat Mac"). A few features such as handoff or continuity might be nice to have, but aren't must-have features. The problems with the 2016 MacBook Pros, IMHO: 1. Soldered RAM. 2. RAM limited to 16GB (same as my 2011 MBP!) - the 2010 MBP could handle 16GB. So 6+ years later, the MacBook *PRO* is still limited to 16GB? 3. No 17" model....(ever again?) Who cares about thinness? Who cares about a lower battery life? Sure they are nice, but they have to remain functional and have to be improvements over a 6.5 year old model. Most of these pro models are plugged in a lot or can be replaced by a different model if battery life is key. So, what is the plan now? Probably pull the 512GB SSD on the 17" and replace it with a 4TB SSD (e.g. Samsung 850 EVO) sometime in the next 6 months. Consider updating the bluetooth card in the 17". Keep the Mac Mini as is. Then, see in 2017 or 2018 what is available from Apple. If Apple again becomes Pro user focused on the MacBook PRO, hopefully the issues will be addressed. Or the with a Mini update. Or a long-verde Mac Pro update. By all means go for thinness on the Airs or MBs. Keep the Pros Pro and the others whatever. Albee November 1, 2016 3:26 PM The thing I take from all this is that people think that Apple miss Steve jobs because he was a mastery visionary. Yes he was good at that, but I think the most important part of Jobs was that he was master salesman! And that's what's missing here. Someone on stage to explain to people why they need this product, why your fears are unfounded, and why you can trust in Apples judgement that what they make is what you want now, and for the future. Jobs managed to do that time and time again with several controversial products. Some of which were quietly discontinued later on, but when he wasn't on stage you believed in the dream. Even when sometimes, you knew it was bullshit (underpowered Power PC's based macs that couldn't compete with windows machines a third of the price etc.) Apple lack a charismatic salesman to drive these products home. It's the missing link. For example all the noise is about the dongles for the 4 USB c ports but on stage no one really made that a feature. No one really showed you WHY this was good. No real examples of the power of this setup. They just through it out there and hooked up some ugly monitors to it. No real showmen ship from Apple. That's why their having problems in the mac community. Hamranhansenhansen November 1, 2016 4:23 PM > Come to think of it, what filed of "creative professionals" are these really not good for? I work in graphics/animation and in music/audio. In graphics, the essential hardware feature of this decade is built-in pen support like Surface Pro and iPad Pro but not MacBook Pro. Built-in pen means you can work away from a desk, because external pen means two devices on a desk. External pen means you have to have AC power. External pen requires USB-A and DVI ports, which this MacBook Pro also doesn’t have. My backups are on a USB-A 3.0 4TB hard disk that cannot connect to this MacBook Pro. In music, you want FireWire because that is the most popular pro digital audio connector in music studios. Not on this MacBook Pro. Second choice is USB-A which is also missing. Third choice is Thunderbolt 2, which is also not there. You also want a USB-A for MIDI and that is not there. None of these can be replaced by wireless because wireless has latency that is too slow for the musical part of the human brain. In music, you also want a multitouch screen today because music is all about multiple actions happening simultaneously at precise moments. It is not about one action happening whenever the mouse happens to get over to it. This MacBook Pro is almost the only device in its class with no touch. No touch means even more wired MIDI devices like mixer controllers or DJ controllers, all coming in USB-A. That is a bunch of expensive and Kruger stuff on a desk instead of just touching the screen. Now, even if all the adapter dongles I would need actually exist, and even if I have unlimited budget and patience and don’t mind all these dongles, I HAVE ALREADY RUN OUT OF PORTS. I had to use three of the four just to workaround the lack of touch and pen. The fourth is switching between my backup disk and my iPad, which has huge storage and often I have to transfer huge files over a wire to get them there with any kind of efficiency. And notice that I got nothing out of Thunderbolt. I am just putting 4 dongles on there to turn them into DVI and USB-A. All that money, new Mac, dongles, cables, figuring out how to hook stuff up — I get NOTHING for that. My work is not faster or better or easier or cheaper. So for me, I don’t see an application of this MacBook Pro — or any current Mac — to my creative work. It is actually easier and cheaper to just wholesale switch to a PC that has built-in pen, touch, and 4–5 standard ports that just plugin to the gear I encounter in the many studios where I work.

[…] Kendall Gelner November 1, 2016 9:07 PM @Sumit REAL photographers scoff at a single SD slot anyway, most even semi-serious photographers buy multi-slot units that are faster than the built in SD reader... consumers are just downloading photos wirelessly anymore so they will not miss it. Not one photographer I know connects the camera to a computer via cable unless they are tethering - which will still work via a simple adaptor cable, and does not need an SD card. Even though I shoot mostly on SD (and there are still other card formats being used and in use from before SD), I mostly use an external card reader because it's faster to transfer files. @Hamranhansenhansen: You are missing the point of the USB-C - any ONE of the ports can be Firewire + Thunderbolt 2 + USB + HDMI + Audio + laptop charging and other things - all at the same time. That is why they have such a fast transfer rate, so they can do many things over the same port...search for USB-C breakout box. You can even attach external video cards for increased GPU power! The 15" has four full-speed ports so that means you can choose the mixture of direct cables vs. hubs that works for you. The Hubs BTW will not need separate power like good USB hubs all did, because the USB-C spec allows for lots of power to be transmitted (which is why you can charge the whole laptop over any of the ports also). What I see out of the complaints is mostly people either stuck in the past or really not understanding technically what Apple is shipping.

Smitty November 2, 2016 2:37 AM Was looking forward to upgrading my mid-2012 15" MPBr, but I guess I'll be getting a Dell XPS 15" this time around. Maybe I'll make it into a Hackintosh, because I much prefer OS X (I still call it this instead of bowing to the iOS-like moniker) over Windows 10. No 32GB option, expensive storage, no MagSafe and no SD slot are killers for me, along with USB-C for all zero devices I own that use it. I'm a photographer and apparently I don't use my machine like Apple or some others think -- I transfer using an SD slot **because when I'm remote the last thing I want to carry around are MORE adapters and readers and cables and dongles.**. I have enough lenses, cameras, batteries, and filters already to carry around. Incredibly disappointing. Unfortunate, too, because I really like the idea of the Touchbar and improved screen (though Dell's is higher resolution....so yeah). Anand Mani November 2, 2016 2:42 AM Apple used to be a company that built sublimely elegant tools. Now, they're a fashion company that makes overpriced, disposable items (if you can afford to upgrade every year). No-one at the senior level has true vision or sensitivity (sadly, even Jobs lost it at the end). They have an absurdly large war chest so their death will be slow and protracted but they will be destroyed by some company who has an understanding of the importance of beautiful tools that really work. They've dressed up a butterknife to look like a fine Japanese saw and expect their customers to cut wood and appreciate the effort.

This was the most boring lack lustre presentation I have ever seen. It was a pitiful performance by Apple and indicates they really don't care any more about their users. Apple are becoming increasingly arrogant towards their users (like Microsoft was in the late 90's early 2000's). And like other corporations that forget they are there because of customers, customers will leave them. No mention of the Mac pro, no mention of iMacs or mac mini. Limited or misleading information about the Macbook Pros (e.g. only half the USB c ports are full speed).

ANOREXIA. afmodb November 2, 2016 7:29 AM I have no idea what have we done to deerve this. What apple is doing, in my opinion, is preparing us for their market approach where everyone wll be carring a computer that will be "macbook pro branded" but that pro will just mean it's a hybrid between iPad, Macbook and Macbook Air. It will be "great"; pretty, lightweight, compact, easy to carry and to most of us not meeting our requirements. I am or I was macbook pro user - now I am looking for alternatives. pathos November 2, 2016 7:33 AM I think Apple is behaving like a rational business. The potential market for power users like developers, animators, video editors, etc. is very small. Why cater to the 1%? Instead, Apple is catering to the 99%: people surfing the net in coffee shops. For these folks, the new MBP is fine. It's overkill, actually. In truth, 99% of this 99% could probably do everything they're doing now on a $300 Chromebook. However, they like the Apple logo and are willing to pay for it. So Apple is giving them what they want!

But next day I felt cheated and I cancelled the order: it's easy to make slimer computers by removing capabilities but selling them even more expensive is too much... Handro November 2, 2016 7:43 AM Why would you buy a PC any more Mr. Cook? Your question is dis-ingenuous and offensive. Does Tim have a PC on his desk at work? Why wouldn't he just use an iPad Pro? Is Apple's design department designing and programming all of the new lines of Apples, iPads, Apple Watches, etc. on an iPad? I don't think so. Its this new fantasy post-PC world more of the population is involved in media, content, and code production than ever before. All of this is and will continue to be done on a desktop PC or a laptop connected to a very large monitor. The PC is not going anywhere. You still need a serious device with an actual file-system and a screen larger than 9" to get work done. That's not going away any time soon. If Tim Cook really thinks that's "the past" as he seems to be implying, just kill the Mac already, so that the tens of millions of people buying Macs every year know that they need to switch over to the Microsoft ecosystem ASAP. It would pain me to switch over to Windows, but I would and I'd know that with a dozen competing OEMS churning new models, I'd have to wait 5 years for an upgrade.

Nick Hart November 2, 2016 8:29 AM I agree with EVERYTHING posted above. Apple, you have lost your mind. Igor Stravinsky November 2, 2016 8:34 AM For the last two years I am finding so much more pleasure in using even a tiny Raspberry Pi as my main computer!

I work in the film industry, and I am very frustrated to start working on a pc.... first time after my 28+years mac user experience. can't believe. take care apple, you are pissing on the users that stick with you in that critic 95'. ASG November 2, 2016 8:58 AM I've seen the new 2016 MacBook Pro without touch bar in person. It's a very nice machine with a better keyboard feel than the 12" MacBook. The touch bar adds a lot of expense without clear purpose to me. The iPad is better at touch - is there no app for that (touch bar). I don't understand all the tech details if it will benchmark better or worse than PCs. My programs run with my current MacBook. People are saying it's not a Pro, but it's far too thick to replace the Air. The Air has a tapered design that is much more elegant. It feels like Apple was trying to merge the Air and Pro lines, but was too afraid or missed the big picture in the keynote. They missed the chance for a bold new unified design that would signify a new epoch. And this is Apple's problem lately- failing to articulate a vision of next generation computing. Mike Jarjoura November 2, 2016 8:59 AM So it seems I'll be keeping my Mac Pro (ala 2010) for much longer. Apple's business model of software and hardware seems to be chasing the consumer, telling us they are for the Pros, barely making it reach the Prosumer, all while watching a wonderful 26yrs of my Mac music studio going to 'thinner and lighter'. Yikes. Tim Cook should hire a real industry pro for audio/video and let's get back to building computers that are upgrade-able, expandable, and capable of leading the industry. Keep Phil Schiller for the consumer hardware, and find some real experts in the field to help guide them back to the front of what made Apple so great, audio/video industry leading tools. I'm sorry but my iPad can't touch what my Mac Pro does, and never will. I'm Mike Jarjoura, musician, and I approve this message. David Carver November 2, 2016 9:01 AM I have watched the internet religiously for two years waiting for the new MacBook Pro. The day finally came and... I didn't buy. It's a great machine but just not great enough. I need all the obvious stuff (especially >16Gb Memory) but they're just not there. For the first time in years I'm seriously considering whether to continue with Mac. Other vendors won't have the quality, but they have learned about style and most importantly they can provide what Apple won't. It's not just the MacBook Pro either so much of their other products, hard and soft, have lost their way. It's as if the people who design, test and approve their stuff live in a little microcosm that is oblivious to real world requirements. Allen November 2, 2016 9:05 AM Apple has always overcharged. But I've always been willing to pay the extra for a superior experience. Once you chop away enough at the experience, as has happened with these new MacBook Pros, then you're just being ripped off. Craig November 2, 2016 9:18 AM I watched the introduction of the new MBP and was, as many professionals, sorely disappointed. I planned to replace my slightly-over-3-year-old MBP this year and anticipated a new MBP, but I'm just not sure anymore. The TouchBar is 'cool' but *really* I don't see it as a revolutionary bit of kit. It's a gewgaw. Since, mostly I use my MBP in clamshell mode connected to what appears to be the last Apple monitor I'll ever own I don't see me developing a taste for a shiny bit that is tucked away 99% of the time. (Remember when Apple monitors were a bargaining chip to hire new talent?) Yes, the damn thing is lighter and thinner, but when you add the dongles and adapters needed to connect peripherals and get the machine back to fighting weight I'll have more weight *and bulk* in my case than before. WTF guys? Given that my laptop seldom leaves the office I considered buying a MacPro as my primary work device (and pull the MBP out when I travel) - but the MP design is over 3 years old and wholly ignored so I'm not sure they'll be around much longer. A sticking point for me a few years ago was Final Cut but after the debacle that is the current version I moved to Adobe's editing suite (as did most of my peers), so for the first time in two decades I'm considering buying a PC since most of the software I use daily (Adobe CC) is now *truly* cross-platform. I just feel sad that after so long LOVING my Macs and soft-selling them to friends and family I may have to carry a shoddy plastic POS and worry about BSOD and viruses. And, once I exit the Mac-verse, do I really need an iPhone anymore? The primary draw for an iPhone was syncing contacts and calendar. This is beginning to feel like the Sculley years. Mark Walters November 2, 2016 9:30 AM I'm actually just sad about how the MacBook "Pro" has taken a turn towards the consumer rather than prosumer. The best machine I ever bought is my current 2009 17" MBP, matte screen, nice keys, tons of useful ports, replaceable drives, etc. I use it every evening, all evening. If I have to render something big I just send it up to my windows machine (but I would rather not). Unfortunately I have patiently waited for a true replacement but nothing has happened. Don't get me wrong I'm not an old-fashioned guy, I have an iPad Pro, iPhone 6s plus and three new apple TVs. However, my Macbook Pro still works great with two new big SSDs. but soon I'll have to get a replacement 17" and it is looking less and less like it will be an Apple. Before reading this thread I had just told my wife that I would pay 5 grand if Apple could just cram everything new into this chassis. Imagine that, 17" screen, tons of ports, ~18-24 hr battery life? Anyway, Apple, not everyone is jet setting around all the time looking to shave another two ounces off their laptop again. Do me a favor, take a step back from your quarterly sales numbers and don't confuse momentum selling with current success. I think the momentum selling from such great machines from ~2008 to ~2012 is masking your current failure. Good luck Apple...really. The sad thing is that the happiest part for me has been to get this dissatisfaction off my chest. hmmm The £1,450 2016 MacBook Pro reviewed: An expensive MacBook Air on the inside November 2, 2016 9:34 AM […] little from the 2014 and 2013 models—have been birthed into this era of frustration.

They don't need to make gaming rigs but the latest rendition leaves Mac users so far behind the curve gaming isn't really an option unless you want to play retro gaming. Apple need to start listening to there customers, building computers for designers and artist fine do that but give the rest of us some options !!!! Andres Alarcón November 2, 2016 10:10 AM Apple is getting rotten! Their lack of really new ideas and love to their computers line is sad. Apple, please don't call it pro any more if you can't deliver something worth of that name. Joe November 2, 2016 10:12 AM I am for the first time since ... well forever in computer terms thinking of jumping ship. There seems to be no real NEW pazazz or innovation that keeps pace with the others. I am used to being able to brag and hold my head high as a mac user. After my co-workers rubbed my face in the new Windows Studio product and other laptops such as the Razor Blade I am very worried about my alliance and allegiance to MAC. I will wait for one more round of new products to decide. But from what I am reading... sighs. Miller November 2, 2016 10:13 AM I'm starting to feel like I did when I was a Windows power user. I didn't want to leave PC, but the choices the company made left me no choice. We (mac users) have sacrificed upgradability for years, but when you can't update basic things like ram & storage I question your design language & intelligence. I thought it was "form follows function?" One easy choice Apple could make......manufacture an upgradable mac Pro (desktop). This may be the last stand for a chunk of loudest supporters! Hunter James November 2, 2016 10:22 AM It's nice to know that I am not the only one thinking Apple has lost their way. Tim Cook is killing the Apple that I have invested 32 years of my life in. It is sad to see that Apple could careless about the users that helped them get to where they are today. I never thought I would say this but I might have to learn how to use a PC! thomas vincent November 2, 2016 10:30 AM Professional for the Cinema and TV for 20 years, Mac users for 8 years, and probable not for another time. Sorry Apple, i start feeling a lack off respect and care about our customers, with who you start with from the botton. I feel almost offended by hoe pretentious your words are, and the final specs on this highly priced notebook, you define as your top of line professional station. I say this with pleasure, but which choice are you offering us? we were already quite patient.... Cameron, Australia November 2, 2016 10:35 AM Apple has had wonderful success with enabling generally computer and tech shy people via iPads and iPhones. These consumers are into social media and connection, movies and news, sharing photos or listening to music. Its consumer tech. Well done. Great technology achievement. I see many happy people that previously would not go near a computer, and Apple has done well in getting these things right for this segment of the human population. Like so many MBP users, I buy an expensive, top of the range MBP because the above is not my interest. I want to push boundaries, do serious research and powerful data analysis, video editing, programming, experimental works - and connect with colleagues while I am doing it if need be. I put out the money, including the extended warranty, for sound reliability and maximum up time, ease of portability so I can work at home or on the go, computational power that enables me to push boundaries and be ahead of the crowd, run big projects, and multiple tasking, as well as quality of OS and work flow design so I can focus on what I want to do, not how to go about being able to do it. All this so I can just get on with serious productive endeavours. In short, I like creating the new world, not playing in the current one. Not everyone wants the lightest most compact streamlined multimedia device to slip in their handbag. Seriously! Applying that design ethos, so successful for ipads and iphones, to serious computing hardware like Macbook Pro's is a major error of thinking and dangerously monocular vision. At this point you seem to be trying the turn the MBP into the form fit of an ipad, with the cost of a car for doing so. Let this minimalist size design attempt go (and I mean completely), and came back with something serious tailored to the innovators and boundary pushers and surprise us. I don't mean a 5 kg brick, but I do mean replacable battery, choice and upgradable ram, graphics cards, SSD's, and multiple ports so can plug what ever I have and might want into it without fiddling around with multiple connectors and leads and dongles. Handbags are out, backpacks are in. Lets feel the gravity of the device! Serious gear, plenty of tolerance, adaptability, robustness, reliability, leading edge performance, with meaningful tech savvy extra's not eye candy strips. Macanix November 2, 2016 10:43 AM After reading all the responses and reactions to the underwhelming event, I am glad to see that I am not the "cranky, cynical, greybeard". Apple is truly disconnected from its core customers and on the downward slide. If I were a competitor, I would exploit this gap: make a product upgradeable, make a product last but not so much that it kills the bottom end, make a product the customers ask for not what you think they need. mrdex November 2, 2016 10:52 AM Been an Apple fan for many years. Still am. But yes, this new "update" is hardly that. The Touch Bar is certainly creative and potentially quite useful; however, the actual specs are not worth what they are charging. Newton Poetry — Where Apple and I Differ November 2, 2016 11:45 AM […] release of the new Touch Bar MacBook Pro has made a lot of news. There’s good reason: it’s a signal to us longer-term fans of Macintosh computers that […] Dan Jaffe November 2, 2016 11:48 AM The MacBook Air is dead model, the new MacBook is really its replacement. Then, the new MacBook Pro’s are the new MacBooks, with a newer more powerful and useful Pro model still to come (hopefully). What I see here is the lack of spark to be bold not always safe. The new Mac Pro system was a glimmer of hope, the lack of a followup systems in the line is disappointing! While the new 'Thin Series' iMac's have been a success in the marketplace they are not a substitute for a Pro system. Apple's failure of making a repairable system is also very worrisome! For a company that prides its self on being ecology minded the focusing of people to always buy anew to gain a small step of upgrade is not logical! Memory & storage needs to be a serviceable option not major surgery as seen in the newer 21.5" models! Yes, Intel's inability to offer Apple the needed CPU's is likely part of it for sure, but theres more here than the processor issue. It's the manic vision of thinner & lighter, just jettisoning stuff to get us there philosophy which is driving things here that needs to be held in check. Yes! We all want thinner & lighter systems but not at the cost of being useful a device. Basically, Apple is failing us real Pro’s! Which is were the 'Pro' implies in the name here. We need more storage and RAM than these models offer. We also need to have interchangeable RAM & Storage. So here is what I want, use the older non retina 15" MacBook Pro cases add in the retina display, add in the new touch bar and now this is were we go a very different direction! Two high performance memory modules using a ZIF connector system (8, 16, 32 or 64 GB memory options). Two SSD slots allowing either one or two SSD’s (1, 2, 4 & 8 TB modules). I would also offer RAID support so they are still faster. I would even offer a 17" model again and the 13" model would offer only one memory & SSD module support do it is size limitations. As for ports, I would go back to the MagSafe for power, USB-C is not the best option for AC power input sorry. What made the Mac laptop a seller was not having to worry you'll trip on the cord. I would also add back in two older USB 3.1 connections plus the three USB-C ports and an SD slot (three ports per side). The focus here is to remove the need for adapters as much as possible. With the bigger box you can offer a bigger battery as well! To add even more power, Yes, it will weigh more I can live with it, maybe in a few years technology will advance so it can be trimmed down. Lastly, I would allow an auxiliary battery option to plug in via the USB-C like a Morphie battery pack we use today with an iOS device. Apple seems to forget we are not always connected to the internet (or have a very slow connection) or have access to AC power sources in the real world, so local storage and lots of battery life is still critical to us. I've had a Mac since it first came out and throughout its many generations. Sadly, I’ll be sticking to my old MacBook Pro for a few more years and when I can’t use it anymore hopefully Apple comes though with a real Pro's model. Matthew Broms November 2, 2016 11:51 AM Another sad point is I seriously doubt Apple will truly hear the despair or get the message and do anything about it because all they'll look at is how well they're selling. Expect loads of press about it to offset us pundits as Phil and Tim and company convince themselves and others of what a great job they did. Of course they'll sell a lot... they haven't had a meaningful update in over 4 years - the pent up demand is overwhelming! Those figures are a false positive though. Like so many others here, I was SUPER excited at the prospect of getting a substantial laptop upgrade from Apple and I'm left DEEPLY disappointed. We bought the most killer MacBook Pros over 4 years ago and Apple has provided NO reason to upgrade ever since (a machine that lives up to it's name as "Pro" back then). They’re too focused on iPhone and we see it now with this shiny new dog. I agree it's impressive engineering, but they dumped MagSafe, have a barely improved CPU, lousy ports that require us to dongle ourselves to death for extra $$$, and shockingly still 16mb RAM. Absolutely ridiculous. They really have taken the "Pro" out of MacBook and forsaken this core group of deeply devoted and pioneering fans. Apple is making Windows compelling with their lack of hardware innovation and performance. If/when I go Windows, then I’ll be more free to consider Android too. At least I won’t be considered a sycophant always promoting Apple for the first time in my life. I find myself extremely reluctant to upgrade and reward Apple with sales when they ignore the needs of their most ardent customers and developers. They're just aiming for volume and money with these consumer oriented machines at this point so they're products are dumbed down to the masses. That's why they've neglected meaningful updates to the entire line of Macs for sooo long now. Very, very sad and I agree that Apple has lost it's way with Macs and this incredibly valuable group of users here. No way in the world Steve would have stood for this - his mission was more about insanely great products and less about volume and money. Miss him. HB November 2, 2016 12:02 PM Here is my view as a company director of a UK software studio, We own a bunch of Macs at our company and I was one waiting to upgrade my MBP while watching the event in disbelieve... Worse it was when you had just watched the MS event the day before. That was ALL that Apple didn't do, they really nailed and appreciated the fact that EVERYONE in a way or another buys machines that they see real PROs using, it is all about the "aspirational" thing Apple was so good about! The popularity of the Macs (and therefore all other products from Apple) was mostly due to the fact that key creators, artists, authors, videographers, scientists, programmers and innovators where always seen to be using a Mac, so everyone else aspiring to be one or that just want to look like one, would start by simply buying the same machines or BRAND! In my case (writing from the UK) no only the new machines are honestly "mediocre" if compared to the mid-range alternatives around, but it is also a lot more expensive! Making us to believe that Apple is really being run by an accountant looking only at the margins and quarterly results but with no vision or sense for the leading edge this products line had to maintain to justify its price-tag, the "Pro" category title and the carrying effect into the other products and lines below. Apple need to keep a central focus into the PRO consumer to sell everything else to the general public, I was one expecting some kinda gimmick like the keyboard screen they just released and tediously presented over and over again during all presentation, but also and most importantly, I was expecting as a minimum some REAL dedicated graphics options (for both machine sizes), counting on having more memory like everyone else this days, and it being a PRO machine, at least some of the ports every PRO people actually use on the daily basis and the SD card anyone on image & video editing NEED all the time. Pro people don't need thinner machines nor the battery life is the key issue here, and given the extensive delay in releasing anything at all, some sort of real design changes wouldn't hurt too... (have you seen the new MBP15 massive spaces between keyboard and screen? Ohh man that's ugly!). What did Apple offered instead? A set of expensive mediocre machines, with NO innovation other then a gimmick strip screen on the keyboard, no real processing power update and a 5 year old memory limit, then unbelievable low grade video option as standard, absolutely no useful ports (or adapters for their lack of), no magnetic power cable connection or anything else that gives these machines any right to be called a PRO in any way shape or form. Apple please, learn (re-learn) ONE thing..... We are loyal to a point! Even people that wouldn't own the PRO lineup, buy all the other stuff you do because it is from the same BRAND.... SIMPLE! If you banalise the PRO tag, you basically make all other products look even worse, HB" Rudy Gunawan November 2, 2016 12:19 PM The no sdcard port and the need to bring dongles everywhere pissed me off. Better fix it Apple or maybe it is a time for changing my faith to another brand Iain and Tom November 2, 2016 12:27 PM We are so disappointed at the state of the Mac... It's looking like a long drawn out painful death, first the removal of the Xserve and pro level rack mount devices then the stealthy removal of the Server orientated Mac Pro and Mac Mini. We are heavy FCP and DVD Studio Pro users as well as web designers, media specialists and education advisors and at the moment our ageing fleet of tower Mac Pro's and 'real' MacBook Pros have no replacements available. Short of an iMac 5k what way is there to turn apart from towards Widnows or Linux. The Apple of old could see the value in chasing the creative pro markets, the new one is all about iOS everywhere. Such a waste. Such a shame. How they can even dream of selling Mac Pros that are pushing 3 year old tech and then increasing the price substantially here in the UK, it's set up to fail.

I am a creative user (music production and performance), and am completely letdown by the new machines. Why? -Only configurable to 16GB RAM (Should be at least to 32GB in 2016) -Deletion of SD card slot (this form of media transfer, or storage expansion isn't going anywhere) -Quad Core CPU STILL not engineered into the 13" -Unnecessary deletion of ports during USB-C transition -No MagSafe!!! All of these things could have been accomplished by not making them so thin!! If it wasn't so thin, Apple could have engineered the machines to accommodate more RAM and bigger batteries to support it, at least one USB 3 port for our existing USB peripherals, and larger processor options (especially quads in the 13" chassis). Thin is not what I care about in a Pro machine. I care about functionality and utility. These new machines are only pro in their pricing structure. Ridiculous, insulting "update" to the "pro" line. It’s not only about battery life – Le Pavonier November 2, 2016 1:20 PM […] adverse reactions that followed last week’s new MacBook Pro announcement are […] Jon November 2, 2016 1:32 PM I would have to agree with much of the sentiment here. The new macbook pro seems to have the same problem the trash can mac had when it came out (and still does). Design over function. Not expandable and you have to use a plethora of adaptors to allow it to be useful for pro level work. Ends up looking like an Octopus mess on your desk. Give me the ability to neatly expand the machines ability over the look of it. Of course I know Apple could do both as they designed the G5 (and last gen Mac Pro) chassis that is a fabulous and even today a viable machine. Kudos to that! Now update it so I can give you my money and make money faster.

The removal of magsafe, will render all of the existing chargers we have useless. They should have done a power supple recycle trade in program. Additionally the new USB-C type chargers are only 60 watts, vs. the existing 85 watt power supply. Apple did not announce a new battery design, so I suspect it will take longer to charge the new macbook pros. Second, they changed the wifi from a 3 radio 802.11ac design to a two radio design. This effictively throttles the top range of network throughput of the wifi from 1.2Gb/ps to 825Mb/ps. I am buying a few for the office, so we will see how they perform once they arrive. Robert Levit November 2, 2016 2:28 PM Just went shopping for a new MacBook Pro. I have a great model circa 2013. I decided to stick with the one I have which is still working perfectly. Why: 1. As the article points out--I want a desktop oriented machine--power, accessibility, speed and memory are critical--not weight and thickness. 2. The cost: with memory the new machines are +$3K. Nothing wrong with "portable laptops", but there is a place for a "Pro" and the new models do not represent that kind of machine. stephen November 2, 2016 2:32 PM Nice to have this all summed up in one place. I was waiting to buy before the announcement but now am shopping around for other solutions. I am a pro user and need a pro machine. What exactly did i gain by losing compatibility with most common port on all other computers? I didn't need my MacBook pro thinner or lighter - I needed it make my life easier.

Why not ask our opinion and then make what we have suggested? Where is all that R&D money going? Stop the obsession with thinness all the time. Make batteries bigger, be obsessed with putting in the latest memory, the latest processors, the latest graphics cards instead and not hundreds of stupid emojis, and the gimmicky Touch Bar.

For me, all we are seeing out of Apple these days, this hardware release is just a symptom of a greater problem for professional and hardcore users alike. IT'S THE SOFTWARE STUPID!!! The current versions of OS's that Apple are releasing are barely just a shadow of the amazing operating environments developers and pro users came to know. For some reason Apple lost the basic underpinnings of what Apple was - It just worked! That was because there were standards for everything, including (and IMHO most importantly) the human interface. Does anyone remember "The Human Interface Guidelines"? We, as developers, had rules we had to follow to write to the hardware or how we protected the OS, but most importantly interacted with the user. None of that seems to be even considered anymore. I switched to back to a desktop with the last round of laptop offerings from Apple. I am now thinking that for my next box I will just run a VM, that way I can run any and all the different OS's I need or want. The thing that kept Apple alive all threw the lean years was the dedication of it's "Pro" users; what's going to happen now that even the old school "fanboys" like me are thinking why bother? Brian November 2, 2016 3:15 PM Thanks so much for this post. I've been on the Mac straight since 1987. I've alternately rolled with and been thrilled by the changes. But the hobbling of storage and power for the sake of thinness, and the dongles, dongles, dongles these machines will require, is frustrating and even strangely saddening. The company I've seen as one, two, three steps ahead of things for so long seems now to be choosing priorities at random and at the expense of what so many people really need in a machine. Yes, thinness and low weight are good, but only to a point. I need to be able to carry the thing around; I don't need it to float off my desk. Give me power, give me storage, give me ports.

Runing a VM macOS for Xcode. Keeping a mac around for real mac experience with Xcode if needed. This crap about lighter thinner and the touchbar is beyond my comprehension. No, I don't need any of this, I need to carry my work around and be efficient at it. These gimmicks (and price tags) are not worth the value. OSX is nice, but "not by that huge margin" anymore. I have invested in years and years of software licenses and hardware and peripherals that work with Mac OS. I've dealt with the less powerful GPUs (and CPUs) for years. I've always maxed RAM since it started being permanent, and 16gb is ok "today" for Xcode/Android development, but that number won't be OK very soon. I'm getting tired of the OS X ecosystem… the focus on more basic consumers is ok, but dragging "power" users into that seems like a step too far. Annabella Snifffer November 2, 2016 5:37 PM What a disappointment! I waited a long time to judge Tim Cook and his friends, remembering how difficult is to wear someone else shoes after Steve Jobs premature departure. I remember reading several articles comparing him to Walt Disney and what the company did to succeed after he was gone. I held my judgement because it needs time for a new CEO to get the company in the right direction. http://snifffer.com/out-to-lunch.html Drew November 2, 2016 5:42 PM Nail on the head! This is exactly how our entire office of graphics designers felt. - Last-gen Intel processors and a price hike? What is this? - Thinner laptop, less features? We didn't ask for it to become a Macbook, we want a fully featured professional laptop. - No SDHC card slot? - No Magsafe? - I have to buy dongles for everything now? I completely agree with you, Apple is losing track of what it means to make a product for "Professionals". - 16GB of ram is not enough for video editing purposes. - A Fire Pro card is a massive downgrade over previous Nvidia GPU's that use CUDA speed up encoding times drastically. - The touchbar is a gimmick. I don't want to lean forward to poke around on a tiny screen. - That offset "ESC" key that isn't tactile is less than desirable. - Butterfly keys are horrible to use. A version 2.0 won't save them. The 2012 Macbook pro was the peak and it's been downhill ever since. Allan November 2, 2016 6:38 PM Wouahhh, so much for me, I've tried to read all your delicious comments... God save the Apple! I own a MacBook Pro retina 15" mid-2012 for my developer work ; and I 'will' replace it by the new 'awesome', 'gorgeous' MacBook 'Pro' 15" Touch Bar 2.9GHz 1TB PCIe before Christmas ! And sorry about the USB-C even if I have to buy a 40$ SD card and USB extension it's a piece of cake. I did start with a Classic II and SCSI ; and then FireWire... and lost the 3" floppy disks, too bad... Time to grow up, I love 'Apple'. Sjoerd November 2, 2016 6:44 PM I have been using a Retina MBP for over 3 years and would have loved to replace it with one that comes with at least 32 GB RAM, is faster yet as silent as the current one (which is one of its best features!) and retained the beautiful screen and MagSafe charger (I have 2 of those). I would even have bought other adapters. Now I will hang on to my current machine for another year, hoping Apple will crank out a true new pro machine with ditto specs, that allows me to run Docker images, IntelliJ and a bunch of other tools and various build processes. Apple, do not make it thinner and lighter (it is light enough as it is): give your pro users serious pro power that keeps up with the competition! Jos November 2, 2016 7:55 PM Hi all I share your great disappointment. Apple has totally lost it They are taking away all the good stuff piece by piece! Not getting a new MacBook Pro 15" to replace my 4 year old one. Maybe I'll buy the 2015 at a discount if I'm quick. Or get a nice Razer that packs what I need Why? No more MagSafe is a joke. No more softly glowing Apple logo is bad PR Having to get (BUY!) a dongle for anything and everything you'd want to hook up to it is a joke. Can't even hookup your new iPhone to this Gollum of a laptop without a dongle Then the price: an insult, not a joke! Worst of all : this Macbook anorexia is getting totally out of hand.

People have been complaining about the lack of the Escape key, the fact that […] Stan November 2, 2016 9:20 PM I had a new 15" pro on order to replace my 2012 but after some thought I have cancelled it. I agree with all the disappointed people and feel that the updated machine has too much focus on battery power and weight. I used to buy a new 15" MBP every year until 2012 because it is my goto laptop. The weight or battery was never an issue. I have my iPad pro for movies, books and magazines. Most planes have plug ins now days and USB power as a minimum. The MBP was the desktop equivalent that I would carry around on my bike, motorcycle, and travel home to office or out of town with enough power to get the job done wherever I was. At home and office i have a 34" LG 3440x1440 widescreen monitor that the 2012 MBP drives just fine. If i wanted light weight and great battery power, I would buy an MB air. While we are not coding or AV professionals, I would guess that the medical profession is one of the biggest user groups for MBP's, and for years I have personally recommended it as the best blend of power and portability. I like some of the features of the new machine for sure. Better screen, the OLED strip, etc. But I use my SD card reader regularly and I actually wish my current model still had a DVD drive. I really do not care to drive two 5K monitors so how about a regular USB 3.0 port. The build in HDMI port is great when I have to give a talk while on the road as you can connect easily to most data projectors. Apple is 2 years ahead of the game in dropping features, but they are no longer 2 years ahead in adding features to compensate. It is frankly sad to watch. I love apple design but I feel they really have lost their way on what features matter to us. Almost every comment in this thread touched something in me, and I do not think I have been this disappointed since my first Mac (Plus - and definitely not disappointed with that initial model - it was a religious moment every time you played around with macpaint or word). I also have bought every annual iPhone model from the beginning but passed on the 7. I am sure the 8 will be amazing though. I also tried iCloud but find it cumbersome and unpredictable. The whole file/photo/music storage and sync thing is a mess. Thank god for dropbox. Lets face it, Apple has put out a lot of bad software over the years or cancelled things many of us liked on short notice We have systematicaly tolerated this because they compensated in other ways with brilliant hardware or amazing operating systems. But something in me is breaking this year and I find myself more attracted to Microsoft products recently. What the hell is going on? This to me is a real turning point in apple history and I really hope my current level of skepticism is unwarranted. Alex November 2, 2016 10:17 PM I waited for Skylake and Apple rewarded me with higher prices on a machine that has features I don't need while at the same time removing features I use all the time. On top of that, they didn't lower prices on their older models, and eliminated one model all together because it was conspicuously better than their new models. That's the real slap in the face: Those recalcitrant users who want superior design and function over thinness will have to overpay for outdated hardware if they don't like our new baby. Did the idea that a Magsafe port might detract from the perfect symmetry of the MBP give some designer at Apple the nervous diarrhea?

Seriously reconsidering my platform choices for the very first time. I am horrified that I am. But Apple does not have any pride in their Mac products anymore. I cannot shake the feeling the decision makers at Apple either does not care or does not know what their professional users want. Instead they are trying too hard to appear cool by hanging out with hip-hop artists and selling ridiculously expensive watches & headphones. Jeff November 3, 2016 12:59 AM I bought my first Mac 3 years ago, a MacBook Pro 13". I planned to replace it 3 years later, after the warranty ran out. So I was waiting for this for a while, and am very disappointed. Even if I can swallow the price, even if I can swallow the fact that not one of my devices will plug in to it, even if I can swallow the meager 256GB base storage, the one thing I can't allow is the substandard keyboard. My sent mail folder shows that I have sent over 33,000 emails so far this year alone for work. I want a best-in-class keyboard. The previous Mac Pro keyboard was reviewed as one of the best in the industry, but you can tell that reviewers are "settling" for this one. Where is the new Apple laptop with a best-in-class keyboard, the one that reviewers rave about? There isn't one anymore. Apple no longer makes a laptop for me, and so I'm afraid I must get off of this bus at the next stop. The problem with relying on one company that makes a very limited number of models is that something like this could happen. I can't stick around because now I'm afraid of what this trend means for the next models in a few years.

Gene November 3, 2016 4:12 AM I've owned nothing but Apple product for 8 years, but I am done with Apple. No touch screen sealed the deal. My next machine will be the Surface Studio. Remain arrogant, Apple, and you will be right back to where you were the day before you begged Steve Jobs to return. Jake November 3, 2016 6:16 AM So, I'm not the typical Mac user who's complaints I read here. I haven't been using Macs for 100 years and I'm not responsible for keeping Apple alive during the dark years (when I was in kindergarten). I graduated film school and lucked into doing freelance commercial work. When I graduated I could afford a 13" MacBook Air i7 and upgraded the SSD to 512GB when I could afford. I've been doing freelance commercials and short vids since graduating (for about 4 years) and it's been lucrative enough that I can afford to upgrade my primary machine. The MBA works fine, and since there are almost no moving parts I'm not worried about it, but I figure a faster machine may help me make more $$. So I was excited about the new MBP. But, natch, ya'll! I'd have to bog my already-loaded travel bag with dongles and doodads to keep my work process. I keep each client project on discrete SD cards and modified a Pelican case to accommodate the little card sticking out. A wallet of SD cards, cameras and my lappy and I'm pretty weighted down as it is. Opening my laptop on the train with the SD stuck in the side is pretty easy now. If I have to pull a dongle out of my bag, fish through the SD wallet before I get running that's inconvenient. And then there's the SD card dongle hanging off somewhere: how long before that falls out mid-edit or the connection wears out? So, I just ordered a refurb MBP from Apple: the most maxed out processor and SSD in the refurb store and it still comes in $150 less than the new weirdness and I don't have to buy another $200 worth of adapters. I figure it will get me through the next few years. I get pushing technology forward but perhaps Apple could allow a transition that mirrors the marketplace instead of pushing us off a cliff and letting it's users force the market forward; making us their f*cking guinea pigs and market drivers! The same thing happened when they abandoned FireWire for Thunderbolt and STILL there are no *affordable* TB options. That sh*ts still expensive! Hopefully USB-C does better or I might not stay with Apple next time around. Razer makes some pretty cool windows machines (I would have gone that route but the newest one isn't available yet) and I'm guessing this bullsh*t gives them some new customers and the incentive to ratchet things up. I wonder if you can Hackintosh a Razer? UK November 3, 2016 6:26 AM Apple's been going off at a questionable direction for years now, sadly it continues with the MBP updates. While it's clearly "good business" to repaint, rename, resell slightly bumped specs, it's sadly bad engineering and product design. Frankly I can't remember the last time I was "WOW!" after an Apple event announcing new products. On the hardware department we have: - A glorified trash can that went more or less obsolete within a couple of years (considering the available ports on the device) - A succession of ultra-mobile notebooks: Macbook -> Macbook Air -> Macbook - Thinner, lighter "pro" grade laptops that have little new than shinier better screens - A fat and expansive (compared to alternatives) watch that has a battery life of 1 day (yes, 1 day!!!!) Don't know about you but unlocking my computer with my watch has never been a "need", on the contrary if security is a serious concern it's a potential pitfall since anyone with that particular device can now unlock your computer and access your embarrassing selfies :) - Tablets becoming first smaller (because obviously smaller and lighter is better) than bigger (because obviously more power and better battery life, as well as more working surface), it's as if the product designers are bi-polar - iMacs have stagnated in size (I can't imagine why 21" is still an option, I think they should have gone to 24" and 30" like 3 years ago). What's the point of making a 27" desktop computer half a cm slimmer? Or have a tapered design, it's facing towards the wall for heaven's sake!! How's that called innovation? - iPhones have gotten on board with the standard hype of "bigger brighter screen", more MP cameras, thinner body.. Maybe I'm a weird mobile user but i'd much rather have a better antenna so that I don't lose reception that easily, more efficient components so that I don't have to charge my phone everyday. While we are at it, maybe some better real life solutions so that the phone doesn't slip off your hand easily? On the software side: - there's now system-wide integration with facebook and twitter, yay! *rolls eyes* - However, I still see the damn beachball on a daily basis (running on a 15" mid-2015 i7 MBP with 16 GB). Opening a 200MB Excel file is still slow, and task switching is slow. Plugging and unplugging external hdds can slow the system from time to time, - Network manager doesn't play well all networks all the time (yes, I am looking at you eduroam), - Time Machine is still not very quick or space efficient and gives you little control over what you are doing, - There's still no official package manager for command-line tools, default coreutils is ages old... - You still need the horrendous PoS software that is iTunes in order to interact with an iPhone.. No drag'n drop support with the phone is just insulting! (I am not considering jailbreaking as a viable option) As I said earlier, a lot of these decision might be "good business" (e.g. locking in people to iTunes environment) but they can be major pain in the back from a user's point of view. A lot of people mention the lack of MagSafe, I believe it serves as a good example of Apple's previous innovative spirit. They had identified a potential problem many faced, thus an unmet need and designed a aesthetically appealing solution which addressed problem. Now by removing various I/O ports (headphone jack, HDMI, thunderbolt, SD, USB...) they are actively creating problems that require new solutions, some of which are less than adequate compared to how it used to be. Don't believe me, let's give some examples: - I can take my MBP anywhere and just plug-in to a larger screen, TV or projector thru built-in HDMI port. Sadly no more... - When wifi is unstable, e.g. certificate issues, or when the hotel decides to charge you for wifi (because it's apparently 1998 in that city) or if you are concerned about the wifi traffic, worry not, you can just plug in the cable! oh wait.... - You quickly pass around a couple of files, or maybe get a document on a USB stick... wait, where do i plug this again? - Pretty much everyone on the face of the planet that have a smart phone has at least a pair of headphones. These deliver anywhere from crap to great sound quality. On the contrary bluetooth headphones are still occasionally spaz out, sound quality is not as good/reliable as wired connection (I don't care about $400 headphones, it's ridiculous to pay that much money for headphones! Go cut your beard and get a job, you hippie! :D ) Did I mention that wireless headphones need charging? So what happens when you are on 10h flight? or out on a hike? How about battery life retention, say you have headphone that give 8h of playing time. Will you still get 8h after a years of daily use? Can't replace the batteries on earbuds either.. All in all, Apple seems prioritize shareholders interests rather than users interests. Perfectly understandable for a company, but than Apple used to be more than just a tech company. Steve Blank's analysis is very interesting (https://steveblank.com/2016/10/24/why-tim-cook-is-steve-ballmer-and-why-he-still-has-his-job-at-apple/) and appears to hit the nail right on. Would be interesting to see if Apple execs take in any of the critique that has been amassing after series of less-than-satisfactory "innovations". I somehow doubt anyone's gonna mind it, as long as they rake in the money Jake November 3, 2016 6:26 AM Just read this from Phil $hiller: "so far our online store has had more orders for the new MacBook Pro than any other pro notebook before" Translation? "privileged teens LOVE this so f*ck you pro bastards! Sales are king." O novo MacBook Pro e o caso de pensar no futuro sem esquecer o presente November 3, 2016 7:05 AM […] Um compilado de várias reações de desenvolvedores e jornalistas sobre o novo MacBook Pro. Não me lembro de uma revolta tão grande entre os usuários mais emotivos da marca. […] Stan November 3, 2016 11:11 AM The new stuff like the touchbar and the better screen as well as 1-2 TB3 ports are great. But I think most of us in this thread would want regular usb, SD card reader, ethernet port, HDMI, high quality keyboard, magsafe (and even a DVD drive frankly) and also the option to switch out ram and the SSD as capacities increase. Apple might call me backward but I think myself realistic and practical. I really don't think most MBP users really care about battery life or weight. We also get that Intel has been slow with acceptable CPU releases but CPU speed is really no longer a bottleneck and the days of doubling every 18 months are done. Some of us do like to game when we are not working and acceptable frame rates on medium settings would be nice. GPU tech has advanced substantially and in a Pro model I expect better. Cutting ports and forcing dongle use is not progressive thinking and Apple is no longer the big dog that can force the world to shift to its view of how things should be. Don't get me wrong - I think they moved things forward for years but times are a changing. Battery life does matter in my iPads and phone. Also perhaps in the lighter Air models. But MBP has always been IMO the desktop equivalent that you carried around and generally used while plugged in. The only reason I would upgrade at this point to the MBP is if my current 2012 model fails. I think I will spend 1000$ from my cancelled 4300$ order and get a new 850 EVO pro 2T SSD for my current machine. PANOS November 3, 2016 11:43 AM The razor line??? it's 7 pounds heavy!!! Carlos Garcia November 3, 2016 12:20 PM Well, it looks like the Mac died with Steve Jobs. It seems like no other person in that company knows what the Mac should be, how it should work, perform, etc. BCG November 3, 2016 1:07 PM Now we hear that optical digital output is gone from the MBP's headphone jack. Unbelievable. That part cost them what, 50 cents? And took up 0.0000001% of the space inside the chassis? If you're going to leave the headphone jack for "Pro" users, why they hell not leave the optical transmitter inside it? I mean really, it's practically an invisible part. But now it's not there for those who need it... for what reason?!? I mean this is like the new mushy keyboard... what problem did it solve? Being able to make the MBP 1 mm thinner? Does anyone care about that invisible amount of thinness? Doubtful. But MANY people care that the keyboard sucks. Note that nobody anywhere is saying how the keyboard is easier and more comfortable to type on... just that it's thinner... again, for what reason?!? 1 mm of thickness and 1 oz of weight saved? It used to be that Apple products solved problems, not created them. Of course, they look at sales numbers and think everything is OK. But pro and creative users are the tastemakers in the industry now. If regular people stop seeing industry professionals using Macs, they're going to think twice too. It's like how Tim Cook brags that Apple Maps is the most used maps app on the iPhone, as if that also means it's the best. Of course it's the most used, because it's the one installed by default and most users don't know or don't care that you can download Google Maps separately which is still a FAR superior app. I still can't believe that we've come this far since the Apple Maps debacle and, even though I give it a shot again every 2-3 months, it STILL SUCKS. Steve Jobs' "Reality Distortion Field" was one thing, he shot for the moon with some Apple products and made some crazy bets. Tim Cook, though I greatly respect him in many ways, has an entirely different kind of RDF that is not leading us in the right direction. It's incredible not only how bad Apple Maps still is, but also how many obvious and repeatable bugs I find in Apple software these days (especially on iOS) that go many many updates without being fixed, despite me reporting them to Apple in a half dozen different ways (Bug Reporter, Feedback site, Feedback app, Genius Bar, Apple phone support, email directly to Craig Federighi... etc). I used to very rarely if ever find major bugs in Apple software (I'm a regular user, not a developer) and now I tend to find at least 6 major ones every year... and I report them, they're always marked as Duplicates, and if I'm lucky half of them will be fixed. It makes me wonder if Apple execs even use some of the features of their products. I'm not thinking about switching to Windows or Android, but at the same time, in some ways it's very frustrating to be an Apple / Mac user right now... especially when I see how much $$$ they are spending on making (or not making...) a car, yet they can't even find the time and resources to update the Mac Pro, or Mini, or iMac... then when they update the MBP, if you take away the TouchBar, the whole thing was a big "That's it?!?" and "Where the hell did all my ports go?" This isn't like the iMac where Macs were using ADB for mouse and keyboard (which no other PC maker used) to USB which was an emerging standard on both sides, and the iMac came with a USB keyboard and mouse, not something that needed a dongle to make it work. Now they are taking away our ports which are current (not outdated) INDUSTRY STANDARDS and replacing it with USB-C / TB3 which has yet to get any traction and who knows if it will become a standard (remember how FireWire was supposed to become an industry standard?) They should have waited a year or two until USB-C is standard and cheap, and come out NOW with some sort of dock to plug into the side of the MBP (perhaps into one of the ports for the data, with a "lock" into the other port to hold it securely) that matches the MBP perfectly and provides USB3, Ethernet, FireWire 800, HDMI, SDXC, etc to ease the transition. I could imagine Apple designing something really slick that was only the depth needed to plug in USB3 (the deepest of the ports provided), instead of something on a cable that dangles off to the side. Include one in every box and there would be near-zero complaints. BCG November 3, 2016 1:12 PM Sorry I realized my last paragraph might be confusing.

Na Apple se valí vlna kritiky za nový MacBook Pro November 3, 2016 3:00 PM […] Každý den se objevují nové a nové zprávy, týkající se týden starého představení nového notebooku MacBook Pro. Jako první se objevily ohlasy uživatelů, sledující samotnou keynote. Většina z nich byla z toho, co Apple představil, naprosto rozčarovaná, ale nemělo příliš smysl brát tyto výtky nějak vážněji, jelikož si nikdo z těchto lidí nové MacBooky nevyzkoušel (jakkoliv smysluplné jejich postřehy byly). Následovala reakce médií a jejich zástupců, kteří si nový MacBook Pro vyzkoušeli přímo po keynote. Jejich reakce byly veskrze pozitivní. Nyní ovšem sílí druhá vlna kritiky od uživatelů, tentokrát je vedena profesionály a koncentruje se kolem jednoho, velice dobře napsaného, blogu.  […] Barry N Noide November 3, 2016 3:13 PM Been with Apple since the ][, and I can’t even count the units I’ve bought over the years. I’ve seen my kids ditch their iMacs, OS X, and iPhones. I’m holding on to my 2nd-hand 5,1 (bought when the Trash Can appeared) for a couple of months, then I’m dropping the thousand$ saved over the years due to Apple’s product line misses on non-Apple hardware. I’m tired of waiting for a decent Pro machine. Goodbye Mac, iPhone, and maybe OS too. Ivo November 3, 2016 3:56 PM There is nothing to add, Apple disappointed me a lot and I think that Jobs is turning in his grave. I'll leave you while I and Apple could not get a penny.

Translated by Google AD November 3, 2016 4:56 PM Apple does not care and they do not listen, nor do they see the benefit in throwing their customers a bone.

November 3, 2016 8:03 PM With the controversy, I've been comparing the Geekbench 4 benchmarks for other (non-Apple) i7-6920HQ based systems with with the fastest Mid-201*5* MacBook Pro 15" and found that the DELL Precision 7510 is roughly the same speed or slightly slower in many regards. (One would expect the unreleased (but announced) i7-6920HQ based Apple 201*6* MacBook Pro 15" would benchmark about the same as the DELL in areas excluding discrete graphics or other I/O.) I also note that the DELL device has the same size battery as the 201*6* MacBook Pro 15" and, despite using the i7-6920HQ, can be ordered with 32GB of DDR4 memory, whereas there are posts everywhere in the Mac-centric blogs indicating that the CPU chip is entirely incompatible with DDR4 and therefore cannot exceed 16GB. 32GB (2x16GB) 2133MHz DDR4 SDRAM, Non-ECC [pasted from dell.com] The good news is that the price variance between the DELL and Apple models using that chip is only a couple of hundred bucks and while the DELL offers more in the way of port variety (thus reducing the need for annoying dongles), it does not offer as many Thunderbolt 3 ports nor does it have Mac OS X. [source http://i.dell.com/sites/doccontent/shared-content/data-sheets/en/Documents/Dell_Precision15_7000_Series_7510_Spec_Sheet.pdf ] So value-for-money seems okay. That said, there are many more options available on the DELL for just a few hundred dollars more --such as a Xeon processor and ECC memory and a full touch screen that works well with Windows 10 (not a single-line iPod Touch embedded in the keyboard masquerading as a row of function keys). Apple's Out Of Touch Bar | LUP 169 | Jupiter Broadcasting November 3, 2016 8:34 PM […] New MacBook Pros and the State of the Mac […] Jon H November 3, 2016 11:42 PM It occurred to me that the new MacBook Pro is built like an iPad Pro, if the iPad Pro had four lightning ports and a keyboard. Nobody complained that the iPad Pro didn't have a USB port, or a large and configurable amount of RAM, or an SD card slot, or an HDMI port. We're conditioned to expect iOS devices, "Pro" or not, to have very limited configuration options, and limited connectivity options. I think Apple wants to sell their Macs the same way. So the Mac and iPhone/iPad have merged after all, in a way. It just isn't in the software, it's in the hardware design. Note: I'm not saying this is a good thing.

How many library of congresses do you need to hold in RAM at one time? There's a real software problem if gargantuan spaces that would be the size of your hard drive just a few years ago aren't sufficient to do something. Maybe 100-tabbed Safari usage just isn't going to work with the horribly extreme memory consumption that webkit uses? Or maybe macOS's virtual memory management is in need of serious overhall? Now not using the best graphics cards is a more legitimate beef, but sadly this has been an Apple problem for a very long time and I don't see any change there. The port carousel IS annoying, but the industry as a whole is largely to blame. Let's hope USB-C can last for more than the couple of years that seems to be the standard life of a connection technology nowadays. No excuse for the lack of ethernet or HDMI though. But worst of all is the keyboard / touchpad. Talk about form over function. I mean hey Apple, you already are making the iPad for touching, see? The laptop is for when you need to type and you don't need a square foot of mouse pad to do the rest. Don't keep saying you want the devices to remain separate while trying to make them the same in ways that don't really work.

All data for high speed data science analysis it nowdays kept in InMemory databases. Apache, R, HANA, ... wherever you look they need huge amounts of RAM. Data science / analytics with the full data model will probably not be run on the Macbook pro but on a real workstation ob big servers. But for development and proof of concept you need capable enough machines. An nVidia CUDA capable graphics card would help also for machine learning. The former model had a nVidia 750m that was okay for development. So for me there is not any "pro" in the new Macbook pro. Much bling, bling but nothing of relevance. I had reported this 32GB plus for the scientific community to the Apple Macbook pro feedback site early this year, probably many other did the same. Apple did not respond at all. After nearly 15 years of OSX loyalty based on a good user experience i am testing already whether a Linux notebook like the XPS15 / Precision 5510 with 32GB is my/the future.

Recognizing a "backlash" today Apple reduces the price of dongles by 20%, wow, how generous, who cares? You'll still need to have 5+ dongles just to connect your hard drives, brand new iPhone 7, external display, and input devices. Dongles are a huge nuisance and certainly one thing, but the ill powered and inadequate hardware at an outrageous premium is the real problem. $4000 and you get old CPU, old GPU, and you're stuck with a tiny amount of RAM with a continuously bloated OS that eats 2GB of RAM for kernel_task alone? I hope Apple quickly course corrects quickly by middle of 2017 with 32GB (better yet, 64GB) max RAM limits, and 512GB standard SSD sizes, especially at the crazily new high prices. If that doesn't happen, we know this is it and this is the end. No professional can wait another 4+ years for a new redesign with more memory and functional hardware. Earlier today my maxed out 2015 MacBook Pro with 16GB RAM was busy paging out 28GB of swap files, grinding to a halt with an endless beachball, so don't let anyone tell you that "16GB of RAM is enough" because it hasn't been for years. Really, the writing was on the wall the moment Apple rebranded the generic, boring, and woefully inept "iPad Air" as an "iPad Pro" and upped the price to accommodate the new name, which is easily the least professional device ever to carry a "Pro" monicker. iPad Pro? Give me a break, maybe for a toddler. MacBook Pro? Pro for who exactly?? The Mac is now nothing but an iPad with a keyboard and a more capable OS that is being run into the ground as well, the platform is toast. It's time to find a Linux or Windows machine if you are a serious computer user. Christopher Irion November 4, 2016 5:34 PM Back in the predigital photography days of Kodak transparency film, I once complain to a Kodak sales rep that I had moved to Fujifilm because using the Kodak product meant adding several additional color correction filters just to make the image color accurate. His reply was "we don't really care that much about professionals, they are a very small part of our market. " Over the next few years I watched the banks of refrigerators that kept the film cool at my local supplier slowly change from Kodak Yellow to Fuji green. And every time I was on a shoot some non-professionals would see all those green film boxes in my case and ask why I wasn't using Kodak. Fuji continued to innovate and Kodak continued to lose market share to the point where probably some of you don't even recognize that name anymore. It was at one time in the top 10 of the Fortune Five Hunderd companies. If Apple thinks that we are too small of a market to worry about, creative taste makers and trendsetters that we are, I fear Apple is on its way to being another Kodak , or maybe just a slick consumer product company aping other better products. I've been using Apple products for more than 30 years. Sadly, my next MacBook Pro equivalent will most likely be a PC. Preorder Victim? November 4, 2016 6:05 PM Clarifying that while the i7-6920HQ processor will support DDR4, it doesn't support LPDDR4 ("Low Power" DDR4) memory. Rather than put desktop class memory into their laptops, Apple chose older LPDDR3 ("Low Power DDR3") that maxes out at 16GB. This "low power" memory draws less current (allowing for longer runtime while on batteries) and generates less heat (allowing for fewer "ugly" holes in their cases lol). So if the definition of "pro" users are lawyers, doctors, academics and creatives that USUALLY work where the power outlets aren't handy, then this decision by Apple is sound and these users are more likely to complain about the "dongles" (being able to use thumb drives, etc) But if the definition of "pro" users includes finance, engineering and creative people that typically work next to power outlets, then I suspect Apple would recommend they go with iMac 5K (which supports 64GB) or a MacPro (which supports Xeon processors and ECC) and pair it to a 12" MacBook for remote access (which should be FREE with the purchase of a MacPro at this point lol). That still leaves IT pros, software and "field" engineers (huge users of Apple's prior generation of laptops) "constrained" with 16GB or being forced to be tethered to a power-cord most of the day (which won't happen) or choosing a non-Apple solution.

That doesn't mean that others can do the same, even if they did work with him years ago. It's like a fake imitation of know it all that is starting to go wrong. If creatives shift from Mac, schools shift from Mac, kids shift from Mac, no one decides to spend a premium just to try something different. You can't even plug in other Apple things like your iPhone without a dongle. The whole future foundation starts to shake. I used to jokingly say that I might not be able to get a Mac that can build the apps and programs for Apple. It's kind of looking more and more that way already.

When Apple came out with the "new" (trash can) Mac Pro I complained on several Apple centric sites about the fact it wasn't upgradeable and required users to have cables running all over the place to connect their existing peripherals. Most of the responses to my complaints were to just "get over it and learn to deal with the 'future' as Apple sees it". I also commented that Apple was placing form over function when it came to the Mac Pro. Reading this thread reassures me that I wasn't living on an isolated island in my own little world. I currently own three Macs, two MacBook Pros and a Mac Pro (Early 2009 that I've upgraded with 2- 2.95GHz Xeons and 32GB RAM and a new Nvidia graphics card). The MacBooks are a 2007 model I still use to pay bills (and only to pay bills) and a 2012 model that I bought on eBay last year (the last MacBook Pro model that was user upgradeable, which was the sole reason I bought it). I've installed a 512GB Samsung SSD in the 2012 MacBook Pro and I've added a Samsung 512GB XP941 to the Mac Pro. Last year I bought a new HP Z820 that I've upgraded to 64GB RAM, a 512GB HP Z-Turbo card and an Nvidia Quadro M4000 graphics card. I also have two NEC 27" professional monitors (one for the Mac Pro and one for the HP). To be honest, I use the Mac Pro more than the HP, but for high power requirements the HP can't be beat and it's incredibly upgradeable (my HP currently has 6 internal hard drives installed with room for another Xeon processor and the ability to upgrade the RAM to 512GB if need be) and it's a heck of a lot easier to upgrade than any Mac Pro - no tools whatsoever needed. The bottom line is I would NEVER consider the trash can Mac Pro or any of the "new" Mac Pros. As many have said in this thread, I could care less about a "sleek/thin" design - it's all about function.

I knew trouble was brewing when they changed the name of the company from "Apple Computer" to just "Apple"; this was a clear shift to a consumer products company. We now get your yearly updated iPad and iPhones but the pro computer lines suffer. Now, Apple releases a MBP geared to the "pro-sumer", not actual professionals. Last year I really wanted an updated laptop and found a great deal on a decked out XPS 13. I put Ubuntu on it, use it every day and love the thing. I was surprised by how "pro" these machines are; Dell even gives instructions on how to take apart the laptop to work on it / change components yourself, and it doesn't void the warranty! I was looking forward to the MBP announcement because traditionally Apple has made excellent computers, so figured they'd always be in the running for my next machine. This generations is a non-starter for me because the touch panel likely will not work in linux, and the non-touch panel models are gimped to lower specs than my year old XPS 13. I'm surprised about how big the backlash is for these computers and am curious if Apple will change things up going forward. Francisco November 8, 2016 9:48 AM Without having seen them (natch!) I highly suspect any productivity improvement with the Touchbar. The Touchbar means the user will have to take their eyes off the screen, focus on a thin strip running the width of the keyboard, find the spot that conducts the function they want and THEN refocus their eyes and attention back to the screen so they can manipulate something they could MUCH MORE EASILY do with a mouse since you don't need to look away from your actual work to play with a touch panel. I have earned my living editing video for 14 years - exclusively using the Adobe Suite since the Final Cut X fiasco - so the hardware is less important to me now. And I have used Apple hardware since 2004 when, like Jeff, I replaced my IBM ThinkPad with the rock solid 12" PowerBook (this machine is still in my office) and a long-gone Cinema Display. The hardware was so far superior to the competition it convinced me to change operating systems. But the sh*t they just released is not designed for professionals. It's just glitzy and shiny and I'm confident a bevy of 14 years olds will love it. But I won't. (And, apparently, professional DJs won't either: the function keys are crucial to the software they use and they rely on touch to find them in dimly lit spaces so that touch bar crap is useless.) I just ordered a Lenovo ThinkPad P50; 1TB PCIe SSD, 64GB RAM, XEON E3 @ 3.7GHz to replace my much-loved, but bruised and battered 4 year old MBP. The hardware is less sexy, but also less expensive and it comes with the full complement of ports. After 12 years I decided to get off the Apple train and don't know enough about the Razer brand (though their hardware certainly looks sexy). Next month when my phone is is up for replacement I have a conundrum: why pay more for an iPhone? There are tons of sexy and solid non-Apple phones with headphone ports (that probably won't nag me 3X a day to update the software). And why upgrade my ATV3 to the next app-centric model? My son swears by his Roku and (since I don't watch much TV and am not 4K) it's only $50. The 2011 Mac Mini media server will probably soldier on for a few more years. And the 3 Airport Extreme towers will probably be fine until someone figures out how to make WiFi software that lets me create a bridged network as easily as Airport Utility. This downright boneheaded move by Tim and company is actually an opportunity for companies to capitalize on the migration. I wish I knew who would fill the gap so I could buy stock... As to Jeff's comment "am curious if Apple will change things...". I don't see a viable way for Apple to renege on this move and save face. How do they do that? The MacBook Pro Pro? The MacBook Pro Extreme? The MacBook ProS? I think it will require brighter minds to get out of this mess (if they even want to) than the ones that got them into it. I honestly believe Apple is happy to woo the consumer market rather than the community that *absolutely created the Apple brand* and have been their diehard supporters even in their darkest days. There's more money in the 14-25 year old market: we just need to accept this and move on. I have and you should, too. Aaron November 8, 2016 10:50 AM When we moved from our 2800 square foot home in Austin to our 1100 square foot apartment in NYC every single thing we owned had to be evaluated. Do we really need 3 boxes of holiday ornaments? No. Weed eater? Bwa-ha-ha! Emptying the attic I was struck with the number of beautiful Apple product boxes stored there. We're not hoarders but for some reason these boxes were kept: multiple boxes for iPods, iPhones, iPads, Mac Minis, iMacs, MacPros, MacBook Pros, MacBook Air (only 1), Airports, Apple TVs, and even software (remember when software came in a little square box). I sat down on the garage floor and calculated how much we had spent on Apple hardware (and software) since we moved to Austin in 2004. I had to use EveryMac.com but after about 20 minutes I was stunned: $37,632 (plus tax) in 12 years. I had no idea we were spending $3,000/year at Apple. Needless to say the boxes went in the garage sale (a guy gave me $100 for all of them). What surprised me even more were the number of Apple adapters and cables I had collected. It was a big plastic storage bin organized in gallon storage bags by type: FW-400, FW-800, Video, USB, etc. What was more sad were how many Apple Adapters *I absolutely had to move to Manhattan*. I have an army of Apple Adapters either in use or taking up valuable space on a shelf in my office. I just can't get on board the absolute adapter horror that is the new MBPr. I won't. I refuse to allow Apple to force yet one more not-ready-for-primetime technology down my throat. I have Thunderbolt adapters that are still like new. And now there's another effing version? Not here there won't be. $38,000 of Apple products is enough. I'm fucking done! I'm looking forward to seeing the Microsoft Surface products in person. Alex L November 8, 2016 10:51 AM Was looking forward to upgrade my 2010 MBP but 16GB in the new laptop is a deal breaker for me. Running 2 Windows VMs at the same time on my old MBP is a struggle. Instead I went with a maxed out Dell Precision 7510 with fastest Xeon processor and ECC memory. Sorry Apple, I have been a loyal customer for over 10 years but your new creation is a joke.

Luckily I was still able to get one with 1TB. Apple has always strived for simple and uncluttered, but now you need a bag of dongles to do anything useful. I like that my MBP is useful with no adapters required. Photographers make up a substantial chunk of the pro user community. No SD card? Really? Peter Breis November 9, 2016 10:18 PM I do find it interesting how many only notice it now that something finally impacts on them. Apple has been downgrading its efforts everywhere for years because it has found an extremely lucrative, because they are clueless, consumer market. They have eradicated virtually every one of their professional applications and the Mac Pro was an obvious under performing vanity piece right from the beginning and predictably has gone nowhere. They are just following through with the Macbook Pro on the same downward spiral. Apple has developed a huge middle age spread and its executives are in an incestuous conversation with themselves, living off the glory of their predecessors. Given how much money and how many staff Apple has now, it is astounding how little they actually produce, and how badly. I think they have the IBM disease. touchbarbestusecase November 10, 2016 4:36 AM The only use for touchbar will be to play PONG and it's derivatives Mark T November 10, 2016 6:00 AM Totally agree with Alex L. I was looking to upgrade my 2009 MacBook Pro, the third Apple Laptop I've owned and loved using since 2003. I work in IT and need the memory to run VMs and also want a product that is flexible in terms of hardware configuration, not just when I buy it, but in the near future. I don't care how much it weighs, how thin it is, or what the battery life is like, if it has the capacity to do the job. And why would I spend £4000.00 on something, when I then need to screw/glue something to it to be able to tether it to whatever desk I end up on ? Game over. Marc November 11, 2016 12:52 PM I know it won't seem relevant to the MBP thing, but the crappy new MBP pushed me to hunt for an alternative. I ended up at the 5th Avenue Microsoft Store. I thought the Surface Book with Performance base would be what I was looking for. Until I saw and played with the Studio. Holy crap! This is what Apple should have done to the iMac years ago. And the Surface Book is so much cooler than my current MBPr. I figured out where Apple's genius went. After doing about 10 minutes of Premiere Pro editing I was sold. So, I bought my first Windows machine since 1999. I just plunked down almost $5k for a Microsoft Studio. Maxed it out with 2TB storage, 32GB RAM. Comes with a 4GB video card and a quad-core i7. Of course, it won't be here until next year, but it's the first computer I've been excited about in a long damn time. If you haven't seen the Surface products go look. They're worth the switch.

  SOFTPEDIA® DESKTOP Mac Windows Games Drivers Mac Linux MOBILE Android APK Phones Tablets WEB Webscripts Web Browsers NEWS Softpedia > Mac > Blog FLASH SALE: Driver Booster 4      40% OFF! iPhone 8 Concept Imagines 4mm Thin Body, OLED Display Next iPhone imagined in a new third-party concept Oct 31, 2016 13:28 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  ​The next iPhone is supposed to be a hit given the fact that it marks the 10th anniversary of the device, so it's pretty obvious that everyone expects Apple to introduce some pretty big changes. And just like is the case with everything Apple, Cupertino’s keeping all details secret, so the only way to imagine what the next iPhone would look like is with concepts like this one. TechDesigns has posted a new video imagining an iPhone 8 that comes with a bezel-less display and a body that’s only 4mm thin. The iPhone also boasts features that are currently unavailable, such as an OLED display and wireless charging. In terms of camera, the concept creator only imagines the front-facing unit for selfies, which features 12-megapixel resolution, but the rear one would receive some upgrades as well given the fact that the sensor appears to be bigger. Additionally, the imagined iPhone 8 also features what the concept creator sees as a virtual home button, which is essentially a Home button integrated into the display, just like some recent rumors have hinted. For the moment, it’s just too early to tell how close to reality this concept actually gets, but judging from the rumors that we’ve seen recently, there’s a good chance that Apple could go for a dramatic overhaul of the iPhone that might include some of the changes you see here.

We understand the appeal of the latter body type’s high riding position, with its greater visibility, ease of access and feeling of safety. But with some equanimity we’d counter that passenger car alternatives often offer more, for less. More cargo space, legroom, equipment, greater fuel economy and handling, and — subjectively we’ll admit — slinkier designs. Wagons are not in vogue, but trends are also not always right by default. Three of the better and more popular wagons on the market can be found here, and yet none of their sales are even a patch on the numbers drummed up by the Mazda CX-5 and Hyundai Tucson. They are the new-generation Volkswagen Passat, the just-updated Mazda 6, and the familiar but still sharp Hyundai i40. We wanted to throw a Ford Mondeo in to the mix, but alas the stars did not align and we couldn’t source one in time. Here we test upper-spec models priced at or around the $45,000 (plus on-road costs mark), using the top-selling engines in their respective line-ups. The contenders are the Hyundai i40 Premium v the Mazda 6 GT v the Volkswagen Passat Comfortline. Price and equipment All three cars here come absolutely loaded with equipment for the prices, which respectively come in at $43,490 plus on-roads for the mid-range Passat Comfortline 132TSI, $43,990 for the second-from-top Mazda 6 GT 2.5 petrol and $44,850 for the i40 Premium. There’s a caveat, in that we tested the i40 Premium in diesel guise. One, because it was what we could get. But two, because unlike the other pair, it’s actually a bigger seller than its petrol sibling and therefore more consumer-relevant. It’s $42,250 if you opt for the petrol engine in this spec. Each has a rear-view camera, parking sensors, push-button start with keyless entry, electric leather seats, satellite navigation, Bluetooth/USB, multi-zone climate control, an electric parking brake, auto headlights, rain-sensing wipers and daytime running lights. In addition the Hyundai i40 Premium has a massive panoramic sunroof, an electric tailgate, lane assist, park assist and heated front seats. The Volkswagen Passat Comfortline has rear traffic alert, lane assist, electric tailgate, radar-guided cruise control, low-speed autonomous emergency braking (AEB), blind-spot monitoring, multi-collision braking system, Apple CarPlay/Android Auto integration and tri-zone climate control. The Mazda 6 GT has a sunroof, rear traffic alert, low-speed AEB, blind-spot monitoring, front and rear heated seats, head-up display and DAB+ digital radio. It’s hard to pick a winner. Do you value a sunroof over radar cruise? A head-up display over Apple CarPlay? A self-parking system over AEB? Rear heated seats over an electric tailgate? You be the judge. Our two cents: the Mazda or Volkswagen edge the Hyundai. Read our detailed specifications table below for a clearer rundown. Cabins The Hyundai i40 is the oldest design here, dating back to 2011 — a fact that’s clear from the cabin layout. However, despite the slightly dated design and the small lo-fi touchscreen, the Korean’s interior remains well built, and sports high quality plastic and leather materials. Like the others, you get ample cabin storage (big door pockets that will hold a one-litre bottle, decent glovebox, sunglasses holder and more), well-finished leather seats, plentiful seat and steering wheel adjustment and a crisp sound system with good bass levels. Adding some razzle-dazzle to proceedings is the huge glass roof that lends a tremendous ambience on a spring day — though the cloth cover feels a little flimsy. The Hyundai’s back seats offer good knee-room and shoulder, though it’s third here in toe-room and headroom, the latter of which is affected by the sunroof. Anyone under 180cm will be fine. The slick design also means small side windows, reducing ‘airiness’. Rear amenities include LED reading lights, air vents, a flip down middle armrest with storage and one-touch windows (that don’t go all the way down, unlike the Mazda and Volkswagen). The second-row seats can be folded flat by levers mounted near the headrests. The cargo area in all three of these cars is massive — more so than like-priced medium SUVs. With the rear seats in use, Hyundai claims 506 litres of capacity, expanding to 1672L with them folded. The cargo floor length is about 1.9 metres with the front seats in use, and there’s more than a metre between the wheel arches. This about matches the others, give or take a few centimetres. As with the others, the i40 comes with a pull-out cargo cover and a separate cloth cargo barrier that stows away. It also has the cleverest storage solutions here, with its fantastic rail-mounted adjustable fixed barrier with extendable straps. There are also metal kickplates and a full-size spare wheel under the floor. Compared to the others, the Mazda 6 GT’s cabin looks and feels like Hollywood. Or more accurately, like a German luxury car. Its touchscreen may be equal smallest here with the Hyundai (7.0-inches), but the way it’s mounted atop the dash, and controlled by the brilliant MZD Connect rotary dial when on the move, is pure BMW. Also great is the pop-up head-up display, which may look a little flimsy but is a great safety feature (and the only way the get a digital speedo on the Mazda). The leather and plastic materials used are of properly upmarket quality, and the contrasting colours are tasteful. The dials and switchgear are also of a very high standard, as is the newly designed steering wheel. The 11-speaker Bose sound system is the most impressive on paper, and the MZD system offers the best user experience, but in reality it’s only on a par in terms of sound quality. Everywhere else, though, the Mazda feels and looks quite primo. Rear seat occupants also enjoy a little more toe-room than in the Hyundai, and more headroom thanks to the smaller sunroof. The all-round one-touch windows also go all the way down, and you get rear seat heating — unlike the Hyundai and VW. Cargo space with the seats in use is the same as the Hyundai (506L), expanding to 1648L, making it narrowly the smallest. The Mazda also has a similar pull-up cargo barrier and pull-out vinyl cargo cover to the others, though its spare wheel is steel not alloy, and the tailgate is manually operated. To Mazda’s credit, both it and the Volkswagen have very helpful levers in the cargo area to flip the rear seats without having to walk around to the back passenger doors. The Volkswagen Passat’s cabin lacks the showmanship of the Mazda, but its design is elegance personified and the materials of consistently outstanding quality. The doors also close with the signature Volkswagen ‘thunk’ it’s so famous for. The Passat also offers the best screen here with superior smartphone integration, has the strongest sound system, and offers magnificently comfortable seats. They’re about the best you can buy on any car under $100k. The German also has the best rear seat space and the best outward visibility, while its seats also fold 40:20:40 (via levers in the cargo area). It’s also the only car here with temperature adjustment for its rear vents, and it has the best LED reading lights and the most accomodating door apertures. There’s no sunroof as standard, however. Volkswagen claims the most capacious cargo area here at 650L to 1780L, thanks to the boxy design. Its loading floor is the longest and it seats fold flattest and fastest, though the Passat is the narrowest here between the arches. It sports the same cargo blind/cover setup as the others. Meanwhile its electric tailgate opens really high, the back seat fold thanks to flippy levers, there’s a similar blind and cover setup to the Hyundai, a welcome full-sized spare wheel and a loading length nudging two-metres. The Hyundai’s cabin benefits from that massive sunroof, and it’s one that will age well and will fit things that a Tucson just won’t. The Mazda feels upmarket and European, with by far the most dynamic bent. But the Volkswagen is more spacious and comfortable, which makes it the winner. Drivetrains Elephant in the room time. Why on earth have we tested a Mazda 6 and Volkswagen Passat petrol against a Hyundai i40 diesel? Mostly because these are respectively the top-sellers in their ranges, and thus are the best reflection of buyer behaviour. They’re also the best value point. They’re also the cars that we could get at the same time and place. With that out of the way, let’s get down to details. The Hyundai i40 Premium as tested sports a 1.7-litre turbo-diesel engine with the least power here (104kW at 4000rpm) but the most torque (340Nm between 1750 and 2500rpm). The Hyundai engine is matched to a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission as standard. An anaemic 121kW/203Nm 2.0-litre petrol can be had, but the diesel is the better bet for an extra $2600. The Volkswagen Passat uses a 1.8-litre turbo-petrol unit with 132kW (between 5100 and 6200rpm) and 250Nm (between 1250 and 5000rpm), likewise matched to a seven-speed dual-clutch auto.  There’s no diesel available until you step up to a Highline, priced near $50k. The Mazda 6 takes a different route, with a 2.5-litre naturally aspirated four making 128kW (at 5700rpm) and 250Nm (at 3250rpm), matched to a more conventional six-speed automatic with torque converter. A punchy 129kW/420Nm 2.2 diesel can be had for a $2850 premium. All models tested in this specification level are front-wheel drive. You can get the Passat in all-wheel drive if you step up into the high-riding $50,790 diesel-only Alltrack crossover. As you’d expect, the Hyundai i40 is the most efficient car. It’s frugal diesel has a factory claim of 5.1 litres per 100km (combined-cycle), though on our mixed-cycle (urban and dynamic loops) test we were averaging in the mid-to-high 9s. It’s on highways where the relaxed oil-burner really shines, and if you do lots of long trips, it’s a good choice. The small capacity turbo in the Passat has a factory claim of 6.0L/100km, though unlike the Mazda it drinks pricier 95 RON premium fuel at a minimum. Our real-world return of 10.5L/100km under hard driving was acceptable given what the diesel Hyundai managed. The Mazda’s larger capacity but normally aspirated SkyActiv unit has a factory claim of 6.6L/100km (91RON and even E10 compatible, laudably), which offsets the real-world reading of around 11L/100km. Both the Mazda and VW have nicely damped and non-intrusive stop-start systems, incidentally. It’s the Mazda’s ultra high-compression engine we were least enamoured with on test, though. We rarely recommend diesels, but the 420Nm turbo-diesel is a superior choice here. First, the loud idle on cold start detracts from the ambience. The arrival of maximum torque later in the rev band also means you have to work it harder than the others, though its response is instantaneous. Much of this due to the fantastic six-speed auto, which is smooth and intuitive, and in sport mode aggressively downshifts. The Passat’s 1.8-litre turbo-petrol is a gem once you’re up and about, with a typically muscular mid-range that gives it an urgent rolling response, while at lower speeds it’s also exceptionally refined. The DSG auto has the odd moment of indecisiveness around town still, and the throttle response is less immediate than the Mazda. The Hyundai’s diesel is a bit of a slug compared to many others out there, but it’s extremely relaxed, and the broad swathe of torque from low engine speeds gives it an effortless feel and acceptable rolling response. It’s also exceptionally quiet and refined, either at idle or a cruise. The DCT automatic has some typical urban jitters and indecisiveness, but the Auto Hold function that stops creeping at idle and prevents rollback (the same system is also on the VW) really helps. We were surprised how much we enjoyed the diesel Hyundai, and its refinement and economy, and price-point equal to petrol rivals, makes a compelling case. Dynamics The benefits of a typical wagon over even the most well-sorted SUV has traditionally been the superior body control and dynamism in corners thanks to their lower centre of gravity. And even the very best of the brilliant modern crossover crop still fall a little short of the best wagons. The ‘least-good’ performer here (because it’s not bad) is the Hyundai. The independent suspension and damper set up were tuned in Australia, but this earlier iteration falls a little short of the latest Hyundai crop, such as the Sonata, Elantra and Tucson. The suspension isolates the seat and steering wheel from most sharp inputs and lower amplitude ruts, though the huge sunroof has the odd creak over the latter, given it reduces body rigidity in order to offer a better sky view. The car is quite firmly sprung after a European fashion, meaning it stays flat and tied down mid-corner, which is complemented by the well-weighted electro-mechanical steering. My notes mention the car isn’t plush as befits the brand, but it’s controlled and disciplined. Where the i40 is excellent is on a smooth highway such as Melbourne’s Citylink, where its quiet diesel engine is most relaxed and there’s good isolation from wind noise (that slippery shape with good coefficient of drag) and tyre roar. It’d be a lovely thing to drive up to Sydney. There’s a solid argument, depending on your perspective, that the Mazda is either the best or worst here. Its NVH suppression, such as tyre roar from its big 19-inch wheels/slim tyre package, engine drone under moderate throttle, is the worst here, which is a long-running Mazda peccadillo. On the other hand, as befits Mazda’s brand, it’s a great corner-carver, with feel-some steering that’s responsive from centre, good turn-in, disciplined body control under lateral loads and when settling after undulations and that well-sorted gearbox calibration mentioned earlier. Considering the low-profile tyres, it’s also good at rounding off sharp edges and hits. We’re impressed with how initial impacts into speed bumps, and the seat feel over cobbles, are both more than acceptable. It’s a quite well-compromised package, this. But it’s not as well-sorted as the Passat, which has the best NVH suppression on test; rounds off square edges, sharp hits and lower-amplitude surfaces better than the others; and offers the best balance between soft (lower force on the compression) damping yet well-sorted body control. It settles beautifully. The steering is lighter and less communicative than the Mazda’s, but the cushiness on display, which never delves into wallowing or pitching, gives it the best balance. The VW is typically well rounded, in that it’s fun to throw at corners, but also supremely comfortable and quiet. We’re always being criticised for giving Volkswagens such high marks in ride and handling, but it’s not our fault that those engineers in Wolfsburg are so accomplished. Remember that the Passat is VW’s top-seller, so it was hardly going to do a half-cocked job. Estimated ownership experience The Volkswagen Passat comes with a three-year/100,000km warranty with full roadside assistance. The company offers transparent capped servicing costs that, like with all brands, is scaled to inflation and other potential price drivers. In other words, prices can change, but have to be advertised. Service intervals are a long 12 months/15,000km, with the first six visits at current prices costing: $482, $482, $563, $656, $482 and $563. You also need to pay $56 every two years for a new pollen filter and $138 every two years for new brake fluid. The Mazda has the same warranty term as the Volkswagen, though roadside assist is $68.10 annually. Service intervals are an inferior 12 months or 10,000km. Like VW, the prices can change, but at present levels the costs over the first six visits are: $302, $330, $302, $330, $302 and $330. Like the Passat, you’ll need a new Mazda air filter every two years ($67) and new brake fluid every two years ($68). The dealer experiences of these two contenders should be interesting to monitor. Volkswagen has been rightly criticised for years for its middling dealer sales and service experience, finishing poorly in industry surveys. But its current boss has vowed to stop at nothing to fix it. Mazda usually wins or performs strongly in the same tests. Individual experiences are likely to be different. But it’s the Hyundai with the most comprehensive after sales policy. First, it has a five-year/unlimited kilometre warranty, and up to 10 years of roadside assist if you serice the car at a Hyundai dealer rather than somewhere such as Ultra Tune. Because our test car was a diesel, it’s pricier to service. This is common and offsets the fuel savings. Intervals are 12 months/15,000km and cost (at current rates): $339, $339, $339, $439, $339 and $520. Verdict This was a hard test to split. Despite showing its age a little in terms of cabin presentation, equipment and ride, the Hyundai i40 is a stylish and spacious wagon with a relaxed and quiet diesel engine at a reasonable price. Good ownership costs, too. The Mazda 6 GT has the most upmarket cabin presentation here, and looks a million dollars in your driveway.

No doubt we’ll cop criticism for the choice, but there’s no escaping the German’s practicality, quality and comfort in a class where these talents are most highly sought.

Ad Less than three years from its founding, smart-device maker Eve Tech has already inked a partnership with Microsoft, and more recently secured a six-figure investment from Intel. The team's ambitions are high. Referring to Eve Tech's playfully announced goal, to revive Finnish consumer tech prowess and surpass Nokia, the company's co-founder and CEO Konstantinos Karatsevidis has said to Finnish paper Iltalehti: “Nokia is a separate story. They weren’t able to change fast enough. We don’t have that problem.” All of this got started at a poker table in Helsinki. During Karatsevidis' last year of studies he met his future co-founder, Mike, at a poker night; an evening that would evolve into a long discussion about startups and tech. Karatsevidis tells Business Insider Nordic that the two agreed on one thing in particular: “Smart devices were either 'affordable' devices with tasteless design, poor performance and full of bloatware – or Apple devices, nice but terribly overpriced.” Soon afterwards, they founded Eve Tech around a vision to build the perfect product that would be well-functioning, beautiful and affordable. Karatsevidis, the youngest in a 24-man team, brings youthful vision and commercial acumen. At 12, he was already working as an interpreter at tech conferences, and later became a sourcing director in a major company in Ukraine. The co-founder, Mike, is, according to Karatsevidis, a '101% tech geek', and very conscious of his privacy. Eve Tech's core team members have long track records in the industry, having worked on devices including iPhone 6, Fitbit and OnePlus. But what makes Eve Tech stand out is their approach to building devices. “Our vision is to change the way technology is developed by putting end users in charge of development.” The idea was born after Eve Tech’s first product launch in late 2014, of the budget-priced Eve T1 Windows tablet. The T1 had a warm reception internationally and sold well, but the founders would also get a lot of feedback and suggestions for new features. Feedback for the T1 prompted Eve-Tech to involve customers and tech enthusiasts in the design process. Eve-Tech Karatsevidis says they noticed that the same was true in the smart device market as a whole: “Most of the players, like Apple, Samsung and Lenovo were established decades ago and their management is simply not used to the new online age. Because of this, the device-creating process [...] is compromised many times, the original intent is lost, and the end users’ demands are not understood.” That prompted Eve Tech to set up an online platform where the company could connect with with tech enthusiasts and users, and receive new feature suggestions – ranging from battery specs and device color, all the way to which external ports to include. Throughout this year, the community has contributed to a project codenamed Pyramid Flipper (referring to a corporate pyramid turned on its head), a laptop-tablet hybrid. Community members have had direct access to the product design team, and no internal decision has been made without the community's input. The community’s most active and skilled members, ‘Insiders’, are bound by an NDA, and, according to Karatsevidis, considered as an external board of directors. Beyond technical feature suggestions, the 1,300 people strong community has doubled as an early customer focus group. Karatsevidis gave an example to Finnish paper Iltalehti: The Eve Tech team were debating if they should use pen for their forthcoming product’s touchscreen, but decided it was not necessary. But after a poll among the community revealed that 89% of the members would not buy the device without a pen, Eve Tech “had no choice” but to include it. The Pyramid Flipper project was later redubbed into what is now the Eve V laptop, and it includes several features sourced from the community. Here is the (current) look of the 12,3 inch, detachable Windows 10 laptop-tablet hybrid. Eve Tech According to Eve Tech’s website, their lean and community-based philosophy results in: A cheaper product, by cutting out middlemen and only selling online Design that is adapted to customer needs Less pre-installed bloatware Next month Eve Tech will put 500 units of its new laptop on early release as it launches an Indiegogo fundraising campaign to mass produce the Eve V. The company has said the budget model will be around $900, and the one with a bigger screen (above) $1,800 dollars excluding tax. When asked about the biggest community-related lesson learnt, Karatsevidis said that honesty was key: "Being upfront about the company’s limited resources resulted in a self-aware and smart community that feels like a big family. For the next project we will improve our community platform in order to make collaboration and idea-tracking easier." Eve Tech's future ambitions extend beyond smart devices. Karatsevidis says his dream is to keep co-creating new products with his community: 'We are very hyped about alternative reality, AI, electric cars and boats.'

The move was spoiled by Sharp President and CEO Tai Jeng-wu, who told students at Tatung University in Taiwan that Apple is switching from LCD to OLED panels, according to Japan's Nikkei Asian Review. "The iPhone has been evolving and now it is switching from LTPS (low-temperature poly-silicon) to OLED panels," Tai told students at Tatung University, his alma mater, during a ceremony in which he was awarded an honorary doctorate degree. "We don't know whether Apple's OLED iPhones will be a hit, but if Apple doesn't walk down this path and transform itself, there will be no innovation. It is a crisis but it is also an opportunity," Tai said.Sharp said it is building a new OLED facility in Japan to manufacture the displays for a "key customer," but it has not ruled out U.S. manufacturing if required. "We are now building a new [OLED] facility in Japan. We can make [OLED panels] in the U.S. too," he said. "If our key customer demands us to manufacture in the U.S., is it possible for us not to do so?"Tai did not specify when new iPhones will switch to OLED displays, but the transition is widely expected to start next year. Nikkei previously said Apple is planning to release at least three new iPhones next year, including a high-end model with a 5.5-inch-or-larger OLED display that is curved on both sides like Samsung's Galaxy S7 edge. The report said the other two models would be traditional 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch iPhones with LCD displays as used currently. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities said the high-end iPhone will sport a curved 5.8-inch OLED display with glass casing like the iPhone 4. When applied to the height of an existing 5.5-inch iPhone, a 5.8-inch display would leave an extra 7.25mm of display on each side. This would extend the display across the front and sides of the iPhone, perhaps allowing for a wraparound display with side-based gestures as featured on the Galaxy S7 edge. In addition to Sharp, Korea's BusinessKorea today reported LG and Samsung are in a "do or die" fight to secure OLED display orders from Apple. Japan Display -- a joint venture between Sony, Toshiba, and Hitachi -- also confirmed it will begin OLED display production in 2018, although its bid to win orders from Apple may fall short. Taiwan's AU Optronics could also be in the mix. OLED displays can have sharper color contrast and brighter colors compared to LCD displays, while the technology allows for flexible, curved designs. OLED panels also typically have faster response times and better viewing angles compared to LCD technology, with the option for always-on mode.

Yep, Apple is a couple of years behind in screen burn-in, narrow viewing angles and ho-hum color reproduction. Will be big upgrade from aging lcd Many people think OLED is better than LCD on all fronts, and that Apple has been stubbornly holding onto LCD for no good reason. But the truth is that OLED tech has evolved greatly over the past few years, and I suspect Apple is only wanting to embrace it once it meets their high standards. Having a cool name ("OLED") is not good enough... the product must live up to the expectations. If OLED was ready for iPhones, we'd have it (cost permitting), as we do on the Watches now. In the meantime, Apple has the best LCD screen on a mobile phone on the market. That is nothing to take lightly.

Follow TechnoBuffalo If you’re like me, you’re probably starting to wonder why Apple isn’t including touchscreens on any of its macOS computers. The company opted to adopt a small “Touch Bar” — an OLED touchscreen above the keyboard — in its new MacBook Pro computers. It turns out, Apple’s head of design, Jony Ive, is totally against the idea of adding touchscreen to Macs, and he has been for a long time. “When we were exploring multitouch many, many years ago, we were trying to understand the appropriate application and opportunities for [it],” Ive told CNET in a recent interview. “We just didn’t feel that [the Mac] was the right place for that … It wasn’t particularly useful or an appropriate application of multitouch.” It’s not that Apple has something against multitouch, of course. Its iOS devices, including the iPad and iPhone, take advantage of the technology. Indeed, introductions of new products like the Apple Pencil continue to push what those devices are capable of, too. It’s just that Apple doesn’t want full touch displays on its computers. Don’t hold your breath for touchscreen Macs The bizarre thing about all of this is that Ive didn’t really provide CNET with a real reason why. We know through patents that Apple has considered using gestures for interaction with computers, so it’s possible that’s a route it takes in the future, but that’s just speculation on our part. When CNET asked why Apple doesn’t have any plans, Ive simply said: “For a bunch of practical reasons. It’s difficult to talk without going into a lot of details that puts me starting to talk about things that we are working on. I don’t really want to talk much more about it.” In other words, Apple has found what it thinks is a better solution than touchscreens. Is it the expansion of the Touch Bar to peripherals such as external keyboards? Gesture input? We don’t know, but Ive promises that the team is working on refined solutions. The takeaway? Don’t hold your breath for Macs of any kind, whether it’s a MacBook, a MacBook Air or an iMac, with touchscreen support. If you want that, you may want to check out the latest Windows 10 computers instead.

Jony Ive Responds to Microsoft, Says Apple Rejected Touch Laptop Many Years Ago GO We’re not interested in a touchscreen Mac, he says Oct 31, 2016 10:55 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  Apple’s new MacBook lineup lacks touch capabilities, and this is one of the most controversial things about the overhauled laptops, with many tech watchers claiming that Microsoft has become the innovator, while Cupertino turned into a follower. But as far as Apple’s Jony Ive is concerned, this is not at all the case, as the company actually wanted to build a touchscreen Mac “many, many years ago,” but he refused the project from the very beginning. Asked about a touchscreen Mac in an interview with CNET, Ive briefly explained that the company was already looking into this direction, but is planning something a little bit more than a traditional touchscreen on its devices. “For a bunch of practical reasons. It’s difficult to talk [laughs] without going into a lot of details that puts me starting to talk about things that we are working on. I don’t really want to talk much more about it,” he said. E-ink keyboard What Ive might be referring to is a hardware upgrade made in collaboration with Sonder Keyboard, a company that Apple is reportedly looking into for a possible acquisition. Sonder Keyboard is the maker of a keyboard that features dynamically-assigned keys and which use e-ink keys to become super power efficient, which makes it just the perfect option for a laptop. In this keyboard, each key is dynamic and contextual, which means that it can change its purpose depending on app or task. If Apple indeed completes the acquisition of Sonder Keyboard, their technology could be implemented into the next line of MacBooks. For the moment, however, Ive says that the Touch Bar is the best choice for the MacBook, explaining that Apple considered several designs before going for this one. “There’s a number of designs that we explored that conceptually make sense. But then when we lived on them for a while, sort of pragmatically and day to day, [they] are sometimes less compelling. This is something [we] lived on for quite a while before we did any of the prototypes. You really notice or become aware [of] something’s value when you switch back to a more traditional keyboard,” he said. With Microsoft heavily investing in touchscreens, everyone expected Apple to start looking into this tech as well for its laptops. Including Microsoft’s executives, that is. Microsoft’s VP of Surface Marketing Brian Hall believes that the Touch Bar is just the first step towards a touchscreen Mac, saying that he is 100 percent sure that Apple would launch such a device in the coming years. “I've had a day to think. officially am calling it. 100% Apple is making touchscreen mac, 95% detachable. They're too smart not to,” he said. “They would not have planned just the touchbar. Buy a Surface now & let's let the games really begin when they get (real) touch.” In the meantime, the new MacBook is here without a touchscreen, but this doesn’t necessarily mean that it doesn’t cost as much as if it had the tech. The top-of-the-range MacBook costs $4,299, more than a Surface Studio that comes with a 28-inch touch-capable display, 32 GB RAM, and 2 TB storage. #Apple#Microsoft#MacBook#Surface subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news 10 Things You Can Do with the Money You’d Pay for a New Apple MacBook Apple Unveils New MacBook Pro Models with Touch Bar and Touch ID Apple's "Hello Again" October 27 New MacBook Pro Launch Event - Live Blog After Headphone Jack, Apple’s Now Removing the Escape Key from the Keyboard OnePlus 4 Rumors Suggest Mind-Blowing Specs: 8GB RAM, Snapdragon 835 CPU Pregnant Woman Suffers Second-Degree Burns After Falling Asleep on iPhone 7 Google Pixel Gets Hacked in Less than One Minute, Apple's Safari in 20 Seconds Microsoft Officially Announces Visual Studio for Mac Ubuntu Online Summit for Ubuntu 17.04 (Zesty Zapus) Starts Today, November 15 darktable 2.2 to Be a Major Release with RAW Overexposure Indication, New Tools Create Your Own Ubuntu 16.10 Live ISO with the New Linux For All (LFA) Distro Vivaldi 1.5 Web Browser Up to RC State, Fixes H.264 and MP3 Support for openSUSE    The new MacBook does not have a touchscreen, but a Touch Bar at the top of the keyboard New Mac Apps IP Address Menu: A minimalist and unobtrusive Mac OS X application that resides in your status bar menu and allows you to see your current IP address in no time.
