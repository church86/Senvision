It was recently leaked that Apple had not three but four new iPads in the works, probably slated for next month’s big reveal. Three of those have more or less been leaked to death in the past, but the fourth one is a new mystery. According to a Greek retailer, that fourth one is actually a new iPad mini. And not just any iPad mini, but one that has a “Pro” appended to its name. Let’s recap first what’s old news. So far, the three new iPads we’re expecting include a 12.9-inch iPad Pro 2, a 10.5-inch iPad Pro, and a 9.7-inch “entry-level” iPad. Considering there hasn’t been a new iPad Air model since the iPad Air 2 launched in 2014, it was assumed that this could be an iPad Air 3. However, the said retailer actually lists it as an iPad Pro as well, albeit the “budget” model of the three. However, there might be an even smaller and perhaps cheaper model. That’s apparently the iPad mini Pro, which the retailer also lists. Actually, rumors of a Pro version of Apple’s smallest tablet appeared way back in October last year but has since then died down. Until now, that is. It will be interesting how Apple will position this iPad mini Pro, presuming it’s real, of course. It has been positioning the existing iPad Pros, even the smaller 9.7-inch one, practically as “not a computer” PC replacements. The 7.9-inch iPad mini’s size, however, doesn’t exactly make it conducive to such a use case. It’s definitely possible with the right accessories, but hardly ideal. Some find even the 9.7-inch iPad Pro’s Smart Keyboard too cramped already. Of course, this is presuming the iPad mini Pro is indeed real. Some speculations point to a 10-inch iPad Pro, which would be just as odd. We won’t have to wait long to find out for certain, as Apple is expected to hold a press event at its brand new campus on 4th April.

As can see into image above, you get some beautiful 3D imagery of Apple Park in Apple Maps, though not necessarily up to date. Nevertheless, we have some more details and images below… Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case The new Apple Park campus still isn’t always the first result when you type “Apple Park” into Maps, but it is now one of the options. This is likely due to the fact that the change is still propagating to everyone, so expect its placement to vary. Prior to this recent update, however, Apple Park would not show up at all in Apple Maps. The satellite imagery isn’t entirely up-to-date with the most recent drone footage we’ve seen, though. For instance, the solar panels on the roof of the main building are not completely installed in Apple’s imagery, though they are in recent drone footage. Additionally, not much landscaping has begun in Apple’s satellite imagery. Another thing worth noting is that the “Map” view of Apple Park is still relatively sparse, as you can see in the gallery below. Additionally, “Steve Jobs Theater” is also now listed as a location, albeit without very specific information. In addition to the imagery, Apple Park in Maps now has proper description information as well. There are user submitted images aggregated from Wikipedia, as well as a description from Wikipedia. No specific address is listed, but you can get directions by simply choosing the “Directions” option. Other information includes a link to Apple.com and a “Corporate Headquarters” description tag. The new Apple Park campus is set to open next month, which is when employees will gradually start moving in. As we noted earlier today, however, construction is still very much ongoing and there aren’t signs of it stopping by next month. While there had been rumors of an iPad event possibly occurring at the new Steve Jobs Theatre as soon as next month, the drone footage we saw earlier this morning all but dashed any hope of that. You can check out Apple Mark in Maps yourself on any iOS or macOS device, but a few screenshots can be seen in the gallery below. It’s pretty fun to navigate around the area and see what all is there, so definitely give it a try if you’re the least bit curious. As always, you can keep up to date with all the latest Apple Park news in our guide, with an additional feed devoted to construction progress. Thanks, @KingOmar!

Jeff Butts @clefmeister Mar 15th, 2017 5:57 PM EDT | Analysis When you want to send secure email, you have plenty of choices. I showed you recently how you can set up email encryption in Apple’s native Mail app, and that raises an interesting question. What’s better to secure email, Apple’s Mail app or a solution that uses OpenPGP, such as GPG Suite? Let’s take a look. There are several ways to secure email, so let’s look at how they differ. (Image Credit: Pete Linforth) An Abbreviated History of Secure Email Internet developers first standardized the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, or SMTP, in 1982, when there was little concern for security. That quickly changed, and we needed to find ways to make our email communications more secure. Basically, we needed to be able to digitally sign, encrypt, and then decrypt our emails. Groups came up with several standards to accomplish this. One of those is Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, or S/MIME, which is what Apple Mail uses. Another is PGP, which stands for Pretty Good Privacy. You probably know of this one in the form of OpenPGP. GPG Suite utilizes OpenPGP. How Secure Email Works Both methods use Public Key Cryptography to digitally sign, encrypt, and then decrypt your email. They rely on a pair of keys, one public and one private. When you send a digitally signed email to someone, you’re signing the email with your private key and sending that person the public portion of your keypair. Once you receive a digitally signed email, your mail software saves the sender’s public key so you can later send encrypted messages to that person. As your email software digitally signs and encrypts a message, it’s doing two things: It’s signing the email with your private key Then, the software encrypts the message using your recipient’s public key. Key Differences Between S/MIME and OpenPGP From a technical standpoint, S/MIME and OpenPGP function pretty differently. S/MIME utilizes a standard way of putting arbitrary data into your email, with a definition of what type of information is there. Your email software transmits nearly everything as ASCII. On the recipient’s end, software decodes the ASCII into text or binary files. On the other hand, OpenPGP wraps the text and any binary attachments in “ASCII Armor,” an encoding layer. The software never converts the binary data into ASCII. Your binary files stay right the way they started. Another key difference between S/MIME and OpenPGP is more apparent to you, the user. That difference is in how you get your public/private keypair. Using S/MIME, the user obtains the certificate and keypair from a centralized trusted authority. These are referred to as CAs, or Certificate Authorities. OpenPGP, on the other hand, doesn’t rely on a centralized trusted authority. You, as the user, sign your keypair and then others verify whether or not the key really belongs to you by signing it themselves. OpenPGP relies on something called a Web of Trust, in which everybody is a potential CA. The theory is that you can trust a public key because it’s been signed by many other people, confirming that it really belongs to the person you think it does. Which Method Leads to More Secure Email? This is where theory and practice clash. In theory, OpenPGP could be a much stronger method of security. This is true because CAs lose their trustworthiness occasionally. Recently, the tech industry investigated two CAs, WoSign and StartCom, because of trust problems. The industry determined that those CAs failed to maintain the high standards expected of them. As a result, Apple, Mozilla, and Google all stopped trusting StartCom and WoSign certificates. The theory behind the Web of Trust is that users will build up and maintain that trust over time. There’s no dependency on a centralized agency to keep things on the level. In practice, many folks don’t even utilize the Web of Trust behind OpenPGP. It can take too long to build up the trust level, so users of OpenPGP often resort to other mediums to develop the trust relationship. For example, people will exchange their public keys and then spell out the “key fingerprint” over the telephone. If your browser or email software suddenly stops recognizing your S/MIME-based certificate, that’s not necessarily a bad thing. Yes, it’s inconvenient, because you’ll have to obtain a new keypair from a CA. On the other hand, this ensures the security of your email is maintained. My Verdict: S/MIME is Simpler to Use and More Secure at the Same Time I’m putting on my flame-retardant clothing here, because I know that statement is going to draw some fire. However, my personal opinion is that the S/MIME security implemented natively within Apple Mail is both simpler to use and more secure, as long as your CA stays above-board. I’m not alone in that analysis, either. S/MIME dominates the secure electronic email industry because of enterprise acceptance and how it works. OpenPGP doesn’t mandate how to create trust. Furthermore, many folks bypass the protocol’s Web of Trust altogether. S/MIME, on the other hand, relies upon certificate servers and industry support. Don’t get me wrong. OpenPGP definitely has its merits. The GPG Suite is a fantastic set of tools for Apple Mail and other security problems. The drawback of OpenPGP is that maintaining true security of your email while still allowing trusted recipients to open them is a bit too time-consuming and labor-intensive. If you’re already deeply invested in OpenPGP, though, there’s little reason to change. The idea behind OpenPGP that you can’t fool everybody all the time is pretty solid, but the standard for is just too non-standardized for my use. References In developing this analysis, I relied upon a few sources for further information. If you want to read more, these are outstanding articles to check out. “Despite revoked CA’s, StartCom and WoSign continue to sell certificates”, Mattias Geniar, January 17, 2017. “How does PGP differ from S/MIME?”, StackExchange Information Security, October 6, 2011. “OpenPGP”. “S/MIME vs PGP,” Computer Security and PGP, March 30, 2016.

A concise and clear discussion that has baffled me for a long time. You have been instrumental in assisting me in making my decision. Goodbye, GPG Suite. Hello S/MIME. March 15, 2017 at 9:25 EDT PM Aafje Ouwehand March 16, 2017 Great that Apple Mail offers PGP encryption, I didn’t know that. But I’ll probably stick to my Startmail account because they make PGP encryption real easy with only one click. But good developments, I really hope that email encryption will be normal by 2020. -Fingers crossed- ! March 16, 2017 at 5:09 EDT AM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

(42 mm, stainless steel, sapphire, leather loop band.) Thinking back, I wonder how I ever got along without it. Here’s my somewhat random collection of thoughts; a list of things that are essential to my life now. My Apple Watch, Series 0. Perfect sapphire crystal after 22 months. My first observation is that Apple observers like to fantasize about the day when the Apple Watch will be completely independent of a paired iPhone. That is, of course, so that an Apple Watch can be bought by anyone. Not requiring a partner iPhone should increase the available market, and that’s good. For now, however, one of the nice things about the Apple Watch is how much it can and does intelligently leverage from it’s paired iPhone. Until the day comes when Apple figures out how to integrate the two into a Star Trek-like comm badge, this elegant partitioning of data works very nicely. So. Long ago, I developed a working relationship with my Apple Watch, but haven’t formally presented a list of things I like so much about it. These are things that come so very naturally in my life and make it better. Come to think about it, that’s what this watch is all about. I’ve seen some writers lament that they’ve used an Apple Watch for a few months, then put it in a drawer. That’s a complete mystery and one reason for cataloging its virtues for me. While some other smartwatches may do some or all of this, here’s what I love about my own Apple Watch. Not in any particular order. Apple Watch Virtues for Me #1. My daily steps. Anytime, anywhere, I can check the activity monitor in the dock and see how many steps I’ve walked each day. Being a writer, it’s important to track that because it’s all too easy to sit too much. I have a daily goal, and meeting that goal will keep me healthier. #2 My Next Event. My Apple Watch, at a glance, tells me what’s next. With so many things going on both at The Mac Observer and in my family life, it’s important to be able to see what’s next and when. Even when the iPhone isn’t near by. This is a godsend for me. #3 Apple Pay and Notifications. It is wonderfully cool and convenient to just reach out to a Point of Sale terminal and pay with Apple Pay. I don’t have to reach into my carry bag and fumble with an iPhone. Better yet, with my particular credit card, I get a confirmation receipt of the amount paid in just a few seconds on the watch. This is how I pay for my haircuts, and when my barber sees the receipt (from her Foursquare reader) on my watch she just raves. As for notifications, I have them managed so that I only see what’s important to me.  The little orange circle at the top of the display is my friend. #4 Hobbies. Two of my interests are weather and astronomy. While I don’t do as much observing as I used to, it’s still helpful to keep track of sunset time. This is especially helpful in the spring and fall when I’m furiously writing in the afternoon, and I need to take a walk before it gets dark. But I’ll admit, when it comes to getting a full picture of the weather and forecast, I reach for my iPhone. #5 Countdown Timer. I use this a lot more than I thought I would. Whether it’s a short nap with my cat in lap or keeping tabs on an oven that’s pre-heating, it seems like, in my busy day, I’m always setting a countdown timer. It sounds frenzied and obsessive. Actually, the Apple Watch countdown timer is so easy to use, it’s a joy. #6 Heartbeat. While I’m relaxing or napping with my cat, it’s often handy to keep tabs on how low my heartbeat can get. The record low for my heartbeat, when in my recliner is under 60. I keep trying to break that record. Breathe deep, John. (And yet, I turned off the breathe reminder right away. Endlessly annoying.) #7 Workouts. Every time I take a walk, I use the workout app in my dock. The outdoor walk has a magnificent display. With a glance, I can see how far I’ve walked, my heartbeat, Calories (kcal) burnt, my walking minutes and time of day. Then I save the workout, and it’s forwarded to my iPhone for further inspection. I can track my outdoor walk on the fly. #8 Phone calls and texts. Sometimes, when I’m about the house, away from my iPhone, I’ll get a text message or phone call. Being able to respond right away is just awesome. Maybe some people carry their iPhone in their back pocket when around the house, but I sure don’t. I’d plop into the couch to watch TV and (maybe) damage it. There are many more apps and things one can do with an Apple Watch. I’ve just touched the surface of what I do and focused on those things essential to my daily routine that I love. The point is, you too can tailor the Apple Watch to your own lifestyle. When you do, you won’t be able to live without it either. One Apple Watch Complaint Only one? Well, it’s my biggest. Why, after almost two years, is there only one Apple Watch face that displays digital hh:mm:ss? (The activity circle.) Not even the astronomy face can display digital hh:mm:ss. Surely, some developer has solved that problem! If not, I hope Apple fixes that soon.

I like to grill out, and it’s the best. Ditto Apple Pay. Many texts are best answered on the watch, too. And I especially like dismissing calls. Ahh! If you’re a techie and you don’t pay with an Apple Watch, what’s the point of being into tech? Oh, and the Apple Watch is fabulous for navigating freeways in a strange city when you don’t want to look at your phone. A lifesaver — maybe literally.

March 15, 2017 at 10:34 EDT PM Old UNIX Guy March 16, 2017 OK, I’ll provide the counter-point… 😉 First of all, macjeffff … so instead of looking at your phone while driving you look at your watch instead and think that’s a safe(r) thing to do??? Amazing. Scary! And yes, I’m a “techie” … if someone with 30+ years of experience and who currently helps administer a 700+ node Linux cluster with PB’s of storage counts as a “techie” … And I have no use for the Apple Watch. I haven’t worn a watch since the last century and nothing about the Apple Watch has made me want to start wearing one. Look at the list above of things that everyone says they love about their Apple Watch … it’s similar to every list I’ve ever seen … and 90% or more of those things can be done from your iPhone. Oh, but wait, you would have to pull your iPhone out of your pocket and your watch is already on your wrist! Oooooh, yeah, I’m so lazy that that’s worth $400+ to me … NOT. I’m sorry, that’s a bit harsh … but I am just trying to make a point. If you find the watch valuable, great. I don’t … sorry if that means I need to turn in my techie badge. March 16, 2017 at 9:18 EDT AM Lee Dronick March 16, 2017 First of all, macjeffff … so instead of looking at your phone while driving you look at your watch instead and think that’s a safe(r) thing to do??? Amazing. Scary! “Hey Siri, what time is it?” Also these days are their vehicles on the market that don’t have a built in clock? I remember having a cheap watch strapped onto the steering wheel. March 16, 2017 at 10:44 EDT AM wab95 March 16, 2017 John: I share your love of the Apple Watch. I know that there is one Mr Chaffin at TMO who likes but does not love his AW, but I believe that he wears his nonetheless. Your reasons are similar to mine, and if I may, let me simply state that the AW, as currently designed and tethered to the iPhone, simultaneously extends the reach and power of the iPhone, and provides a very personal assistant literally at one’s fingertips where one needs it. It both makes the iPhone that much more accessible and useful (e.g. I can track my flight connection status and changes literally while running through unfamiliar airports while carrying luggage; or get traffic or weather status updates where I need them), and obtain biometric feedback on my health and performance status. It’s now an essential part of my daily arsenal for work and play. I have not taken it off since it’s release, except to charge it overnight. @OldUnixGuy: I’d say your credentials qualify you to become techie-emeritus in perpetuity, and your assessment is as valid as anyone’s. That said, not only are there health and personal status indicators on the AW that are not on your iPhone (heart rate, workouts, stand/activity reminders) but more are under development and coming that your phone can never do. More importantly, much depends on your lifestyle. Not unlike your work habits, such as whether or not you work at the same location day in and day out, and therefore might prefer a desktop computer, vs being frequently on the move and therefore might prefer a laptop; if you are in an active profession (eg a lab or doing patient care where your hands are frequently occupied) being able to see and respond to messages, or even take phone calls when your hands are occupied is more than a convenience and in my case have made the difference between being able to take an important timely call vs continuing to play phone tag with loss of time and productivity. This is not unlike what one astute reviewer wrote when reviewing the first MacBook Air; if you’ve got to ask ‘why’, then this is not meant for you; you’re not the target audience. I would only add, that not unlike so many of Apple’s products, pictures and reviews do not do it justice. You’ve got to put one on and put it through it’s paces to appreciate it, be it an iPhone (which many reviewers ripped on release), an iPad (which was dismissed as an oversized iPod Touch) or the Touch Bar on the new MacBook Pro (which is getting great reviews by actual users). At the end of the day, not every device is meant for every user. First, know thyself, young lad. March 16, 2017 at 11:14 EDT AM Lee Dronick March 16, 2017 I would only add, that not unlike so many of Apple’s products, pictures and reviews do not do it justice. You’ve got to put one on and put it through it’s paces to appreciate it, My wife gave me an Apple Watch for Christmas of 2015, she didn’t want one. After 2 weeks of watching what I was doing with mine she wanted one so we headed off to the Apple Store. We both very much like them. March 16, 2017 at 12:23 EDT PM wab95 March 16, 2017 Thanks, Lee. I think, once you start using it, you quickly come to rely upon it in ways you simply could not have anticipated prior to experience. This further makes it hard to adequately explain, in mere words, to a sceptic who has not tried it, why any device provides a good, great or even outstanding user experience and tool. Now, if only I could convince my wife to put one on, we could do the heartbeat thing. Alas, my digital heartbeat remains unrequited.

Evan Niu, CFA (TMFNewCow) Mar 15, 2017 at 8:48PM And I'm not talking about unit sales. That happened years ago, specifically Q4 2013; Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) sold 26 million tablets that quarter, and unit sales have trended lower ever since. Rather, it seems like Apple may be running out of product ideas for the iPad. Not only has Apple started to elongate iPad product cycles, which now seem to be occurring every two years or so instead of every year, but the new features and updates that the iPad gets are increasingly incremental. This has been true of iPhones and smartphones more broadly for quite some time, but at least in the case of the iPhone the device continues to sell in record numbers. Consider the current round of rumors regarding the iPad(s) that Apple is expected to unveil as early as next week, according to MacRumors. iPad Pro and Apple Pencil. Image source: Apple. Rumor has it Three new iPad models are reportedly imminent: a 9.7-inch model, a 10- to 10.5-inch model, and a 12.9-inch model. The smaller and larger versions of the trio are differentiated enough in form factor, but it's hard to imagine consumers complaining that their 9.7-inch iPad would be so much more useful if only the diagonal measurement was 0.8 inches larger. As far as specs go, the newest models should receive an A10X chip, which should be a more powerful version of the A10 Fusion that powers the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. Beyond the expected cadence of spec bumps, there don't appear to be any major new features or functionalities in store. There's also almost no way that Apple is ready to transition iPads to OLED displays, which are expected to appear (finally) this year in the most expensive iPhone. That's especially true since displays are always the largest cost driver, OLED displays are quite expensive, and the iPad is much larger than the iPhone. Is Apple focusing on the wrong market segment? Judging by the steady decline in iPad average selling prices (ASPs) over the years following the introduction of the cheaper iPad Mini lineup, it should be clear that the smaller form factor is resonating more with consumers than the larger and more expensive models. Data source: SEC filings. Chart by author. Calendar quarters shown. Yet the iPad Mini still gets lower priority than the larger iPads. Instead, Apple is focusing on moving upmarket with the 12.9-inch iPad Pro that is intended to cater to the enterprise. In order for Apple's enterprise strategy to work, it needs to really make the iPad Pro competitive as a laptop replacement. This is a pitch that Apple has only recently begun making, historically positioning the iPad as a third category of device that consumers should buy, while rivals have been pursuing 2-in-1 form factors for much longer. Apple makes it clear that it does not target the sub-$200 tablet market. That's all fine and in line with Apple's premium brand positioning, but it could still tackle the $200-plus tablet market by simply allocating more developmental resources to the iPad Mini. On one hand, it makes financial sense that Apple continues to prioritize the iPhone as its largest revenue driver. On the other hand, the iPad arguably needs more attention so that iPad unit sales can perform better. Evan Niu, CFA owns shares of Apple. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple.

Harsh Chauhan (TechJunk13) Mar 15, 2017 at 9:29PM Image source: Apple. Bloomberg columnist Adam Minter believes that the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone has an unlikely challenger in emerging markets such as India: feature phones. Minter points out that these feature phones cost just over $19 on average and are capable of carrying transactions digitally via SMS, which makes them a great value over costlier smartphones with an average price of $256. The columnist also says that intermittent electricity supply in emerging markets could be a deterrent for smartphone growth, as feature phones have longer battery lives. Though his observations are true, the statistics speak otherwise, as Apple is growing its sales by leaps and bounds in emerging markets. The data speaks otherwise Feature phones are definitely not a problem for Apple in India, where iPhone sales jumped an estimated 39% in 2016 and led to 54% growth in its revenue for the region, according to data from research platform Tofler. Apple stepped up its game in India by doubling its advertising outlay, while also attracting top talent -- employee benefit expenses rose 25%. The impressive growth comes despite IDC's estimate that feature phone sales grew by around 10% in India last year, even as smartphone growth slowed down to just 8%. On the other hand, the Middle East and Africa (MEA) region is showing greater affinity for iPhones. Apple's shipments in this region shot up 133% in the third quarter of 2015, giving it 3.9% of the market, according to the last available data from Counterpoint Research. The latest data for 2016 is not available yet, but IDC estimates that iPhone sales will grow in the MEA countries this year -- thanks to the anniversary-edition iPhone -- despite the raging popularity of feature phones there. While IDC also estimates that shipments of feature phones shot up by almost 32% in Africa in the second quarter of 2016, this doesn't seem to be having a negative impact on Apple. What's driving Apple in emerging markets? Apple's iPhone sales are strong in emerging markets -- despite the availability of cheap phones and problems that are often related to developing economies -- thanks to improving spending power and infrastructure development. In India, for example, almost 79% of the population had access to electricity in 2012, up from less than 51% in 1990. African countries are also making great progress toward electrification, as the Republic of Congo's electricity access has grown to more than 41% from less than 25% over the same time period. Even Zimbabwe, one of the weakest economies in sub-Saharan Africa, has seen similar growth in electrification. The challenge of charging a smartphone will diminish in such markets in the long run as steps are taken to provide electricity to more residents, leading to 79% smartphone penetration in 2020 from just 52% in 2012. Improved spending power is another driver behind Apple's growth in emerging markets. For instance, consumer spending in India has shot up 23% in the past three years, and could grow another 18% in the next three years. As it turns out, India will be the second-largest smartphone market this year, with shipments topping 200 million units by 2020. This is great news for Apple, as the projected rise in consumer spending could help iPhone sales. What's more, Indian customers can buy iPhones with interest-free equal monthly installments that make them more more accessible for Indian consumers. On the other hand, Deloitte forecasts that Africa's annual GDP (gross domestic product) will grow by over a third in 2020 from 2015 levels. This could push iPhone sales there as young consumers in sub-Saharan Africa are quite image-conscious, spending over 50% of their income on personal care. The Foolish takeaway Feature phones are not going to hurt Apple in emerging markets: Because consumers will eventually enjoy greater spending power and a better quality of life, they will not stick with feature phones forever, leading to higher smartphone sales. Apple, on its part, is trying to increase access to its phones in these fast-growing areas by setting up manufacturing operations and lowering costs, which should boost iPhone sales in the long run.

HomeKit Apple’s Home app has received a significant amount of coverage since its release last June, yet -up until now- the firm has remained pretty light on showing exactly what the app is truly capable of. For those already lucky enough to have so-called “smart homes,” Apple’s official Home app is set to serve as a welcome addition – allowing for the complete wireless and remote control of spaces, lighting and appliances, without a second thought. But for the majority out there, the app (as of right now) is pretty useless. This is because connected homes are still far and few between … and largely, still in their infancy. Of course, Apple’s Home app can also be hooked up to a range of dedicated HomeKit-enabled accessories such as: Elgato’s Eve Room Wireless Indoor Sensor, Eve Thermo, or the Philips Hue Personal Wireless Lighting Kit, which together provide users who perhaps haven’t got access to the typical “smart home” with the ability to control certain aspects of their daily at-home experience. See Apple’s Home app in action in the new ad (above). Stickers Finally, there’s Stickers. Launching a dedicated weekly-updating section full of fun and inviting iMessage stickers, back in September, Apple is kicking its want for users to check out the many different sticker packs now available for use within iOS 10‘s Messages app to the next level, this week – by creating a brand new ad aimed squarely at Generation-Y.

As per a local blog, the 32GB “limited-edition” iPhone 6 in Space Gray will launch as soon as next week in Belarus—a 9.5 million people landlocked country in Eastern Europe bordered by Russia, among other neighboring countries. Sources say the phone will go on sale via i-Store, priced at the equivalent of $522 (999 Belarusian rubles). For context, i-Store is an Apple Premium Reseller located in Minsk, the country’s capital and the most populous city with 2+ million people. Other than a new storage SKU, the phone is identical to the original iPhone 6: it still comes outfitted with a 4.7-inch screen sporting a 1,334-by-750 pixel resolution, has a 1.2-megapixel camera out the front and an eight-megapixel shooter out the back, runs Apple’s 64-bit A8 processor with 1GB of RAM and so forth. The device has been dubbed “iPhone 6 (2017)”. Taiwan Mobile in March promoted the 32GB iPhone 6 model in gold casing only as the cheapest iPhone to be offered on its network, for the equivalent of $435 unlocked. Given iPhone 6 debuted with 16/64/128GB of storage, this is actually a new SKU from Apple and it comes with iOS 10 pre-installed versus iOS 8 running on the original phone. Although Apple isn’t talking much about the phone nor is it selling it at retail stores or on its website, it is issuing this 32GB iPhone 6 as a limited edition. As it would appear, offering this never-before-released iPhone 6 could work in some countries. iPhone 6 debuted in September 2014, representing a major overhaul of the iconic handset based on bigger screens and sleeker casings. With iPhone 6s’s release the following year in September, 128GB iPhone 6 units got phased out along with gold casings. The whole lineup was entirely discontinued when iPhone 7 launched in September 2016 and iPhone SE made its debut as Apple’s new entry-level option. Relaunching iPhone 6 should pay off, at least in Belarus and for some Asian carriers. Knowing the 32GB iPhone 6s starts at the equivalent of about $800 (1,629 Belarusian rubles), paying nearly $280 less for a 32GB iPhone 6 is a fair deal for budget shoppers and first-time iPhone users. Even the refurbished 16GB iPhone 6 model costs more at the equivalent of $626 (1,200 Belarusian rubles). The report says Belarus will be one of the first European countries to get the phone. Only time will tell whether or not Apple will offer the “new” iPhone 6 in the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, Germany and across its other major markets revenue-wise.

No difference in battery life between 6 and 6S at all Abhijeet Gupta 6s is slightly better. Because of the newer SOC Steve Jobs The iPhone 6 was a mistake. burge Wasn’t the iPhone 6 one of Apples best selling devices? That’s some mistake Abhijeet Gupta It’s been apple’s best seller till date. Steve Jobs The only factor that brought in success was the push into the market of larger sized phones. Both the iPhone 5S and iPhone 6S outperform the iPhone 6 on iOS 10 currently due to how unoptimized the hardware was to accommodate the larger displays, not to mention the amount of continuous hardware issues the 6 faces, including overheating home button, poor antenna signal, camera failure, and touch input issues (aka touch disease) resulting from how malleable the 6000 Series Aluminium was. The only thing going for the iPhone 6 was the HD Retina display, which comes in second to smallest upgrade footprint to the iPhone 7. burge Was it or was it not one of Apples best selling devices, A Yes or No answer will do. So in that respect it was not a mistake. And to add my iPhone 6 that my daughter now uses has none of the issues you mentioned. You only hear about people complaining about issues what about the majority yes majority of users who didn’t have and still don’t have issues with the iPhone 6. Steve Jobs Was the Galaxy Note 7 not one of Samsung’s best selling devices? Had it not been for the hazardous battery the device would have been adopted in masses since it beat all of Samsung’s previous preorder records. The difference is that the iPhone 6’s hardware issues weren’t life threatening, and took time to show. Of course 100% of people won’t have the same issue, but it’s ignorant to assume everything I listed is a non-issue because some that you have haven’t shown any issues yet. Emphasis on the yet. I do repairs on the side and the issues I listed are way more common with the iPhone 6 than any previous or succeeding iterations of the iPhone. It really irks me when people have to get defensive about their favorite brand. Success has nothing to do with long term investment for the user. burge You made a statement that it was a mistake you didn’t think about it being one of Apples best selling devices and now you can not except that fact. Mistake or not you can not argue with solid fact but your going to keep trying. And what has Samsung got to do with it your trying to say the iPhone 6 was a mistake. Some mistake for one of apples best selling devices. Steve Jobs The Note 7 was the best selling device to date until it was recalled. If Apple had the same battery issue it’d also be recalled.

One of those components is Apple’s A-series chipsets, although in recent times it seems that TSMC might have taken over. However in a report from ET News (via AppleInsider), word on the street has it that Samsung could be returning to the fold for 2018’s iPhone and the A12 chipset. Unless Apple changes something, this year’s A11 chipset is expected to continue to be supplied by TSMC, but the report claims that Samsung will be making “supplemental investments” to its 10-nanometer production lines next month, and build out 7-nanometer facilities in 2018 in which Samsung is hoping to get the jump on TSMC. Some have suggested that Apple might be hesitant to rely on Samsung again given how fiercely both companies are competing against each other, but if the predictions of an iPhone “super cycle” are true, then there is a good chance that Apple might need Samsung to lend a helping hand in order to meet the demand for their iPhones. It is estimated that this super cycle could result in a 20% increase in unit sales. Filed in Apple >Cellphones >Rumors. Read more about iPhone, Samsung and SoC.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Business Image Source: Shutterstock Apple found guilty of iPhone price-fixing scheme in Russia Yoni Heisler @edibleapple March 14th, 2017 at 7:14 PM Share Tweet This past August, Russia’s Federal Anti-Monopoly Service (FAS) said that Apple may have orchestrated a price-fixing scheme in the country via its network of Apple authorized resellers, an allegation Apple vehemently denied. “Resellers set their own prices for the Apple products they sell in Russia and around the world,” Apple said at the time. Don't Miss: Leaks reveal the 10 most exciting new features coming to Samsung’s Galaxy S8 Now, seven months later, Russia’s FAS has found Apple guilty of price-fixing the retail price of iPhones in the country. Per the Financial Times, Apple told upwards of 16 resellers that they couldn’t sell various iPhone 5 and iPhone 6 models below a certain price. To this point, the FAS’ investigation found that all Apple resellers just so happened to initiate the same pricing structure across multiple iPhone models at launch. A translated FAS statement on the matter reads in part: The investigation revealed that from the start of official sales in Russia Apple iPhone 5s models, iPhone 5c, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus the majority of resellers have installed on them the same prices that are recommended of “Apple Rus”, and supported them for about 3 months. The FAS further claims that resellers not willing to cooperate with Apple’s iPhone pricing matrix risked losing their partnership with the Cupertino-based company. Notably, the investigation found no evidence of price fixing with respect to the iPhone 7. Apple hasn’t yet issued a statement on the ruling but the company reportedly has three months to file a formal defense on the matter. If Apple’s appeal falls flat, the company may be subject to fines equal to 15% of iPhone sales in the country. As a final point, it’s worth noting that Apple cooperated with the FAS investigation and has reportedly enacted new guidelines to prevent the alleged price fixing behavior from happening again in the future.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: Handy Abovergleich The iPhone you want probably won’t launch in September Chris Smith @chris_writes March 14th, 2017 at 8:00 PM Share Tweet The iPhone 8 will be unlike any iPhone Apple made to date when it comes to design and features. It’ll have a large bezel-free display, no home button, a fingerprint sensor embedded in the screen, and wireless charging. But there are also other differences you won’t appreciate. The entry price for the iPhone 8 will be a lot higher than what a new iPhone usually costs, and the handset might not be available in stores in mid- to late September, as we all expect. Don't Miss: Google is trying really hard to make a smart jacket you won’t totally hate A new report from Digitimes indicates that TPK Holding will supply new thin film-based touch sensors for the AMOLED iPhone. There’s nothing exciting about this particular type of news, as new devices often need new specialized components to handle some task. In this case, the touch sensors are required to enable 3D Touch on the upcoming iPhone, and it’s unsurprising to hear that Apple has been developing new 3D Touch tech for the upcoming iPhone. However, the report says the component is 60% more expensive than the iPhone 7’s 3D Touch sensors. The price went up from $9 (iPhone 7) to $15 (iPhone 8). This is indirect proof that seems to further cement the idea that the iPhone 8 will be more expensive to manufacture. With Apple likely interested in maintaining its margins, the extra costs will likely be passed to the consumer. The component is more expensive because “3D Touch modules for use in the new iPhone equipped with AMOLED panels involves a more complicated manufacturing process and adoption of thin film-based touch sensors.” The report also notes that TPK will begin supplying the film-based touch sensors in the fourth quarter of 2017, a detail that seems to suggest Apple might not be able to launch the iPhone 8 in September. At least two other reports said that certain iPhone 8 components might force Apple to delay the production start for the iPhone 8, including the new ultrasound-based Touch ID fingerprint sensor that’s going to be built into the display and an advanced 3D camera system that might be used for augmented reality and facial recognition features. It’s likely these sophisticated components will also be rather expensive to make, which would further explain why Apple will increase the starting price for the handset.

Indeed, some designers, when putting together iOS 11 mockups, seem to focus on cobbling together fantastical features without ever stopping to contemplate whether or not their designs are practical or even doable. Imagining futuristic iOS 11 features can certainly be fun and entertaining, but sometimes we’ve got to take a step back and focus on iOS features Apple might actually implement. Don't Miss: Inside source confirms Galaxy S8 release date for at least one major market Stepping up to the plate in this regard, Matt Birchler of Birchtree recently put together an interesting list of iOS 11 lockscreen ideas that not only seem doable, but might actually be extremely useful. As a quick example, Birchler envisions a scenario where Apple might put weather information onto the top corner of the lock screen. Birchler reasons that many people turn on their phones to get a quick weather update so putting that information in plan view would be extremely efficient. Now I’m not sure people check their weather that often during the day, but the mockup below illustrates just one way in which Apple could take advantage of the mostly empty real estate on the iOS lock screen. Another intriguing idea Birchler raises is threading Messages notifications on the lock screen. I’m not sure Apple will go down this route, but Birchler’s idea could easily help clean up some notification clutter on the lock screen. Some other ideas Birchler puts forward include a smart notification system and the ability to add third-party apps to the lock screen itself, an intriguing idea to say the least. With Apple set to unveil iOS 11 in just about three months, we curiously still haven’t heard much about what type of features Apple’s next-gen mobile OS will bring to the table, save for a few rumblings about Dark Mode, enhanced Siri support, group FaceTime chat functionality and few other minor tweaks. The following iOS 11 concept video, this one from designer Jacek Zieba, encapsulates a few of these ideas.

Citing an undisclosed industry insider, local outlet The Investor reports Samsung’s display division is working on incorporating a pressure-sensitive sensor for 3D Touch into the panel. Apple previously included the feature in the iPhone 6S, but now it appears it could be coming to the new S8 too. Follow TNW at SXSW 2017! We're covering the weird and wonderful tech at SXSW, join us in the fun. PARTY TIME While Huawei has already showcased pressure-sensitive OLED screens with its Mate S and P9 handsets, Samsung could turn the tech up a notch. “The latest technology boasts higher sensitivity and a wider range of pressure-sensing levels compared to the previous one used in Huawei’s P9 in 2015,” the source further told The Investor. It seems the revamped Galaxy S8 might support the functionality only to a limited degree though. In light of scrapping the physical home button, Samsung is expected to partly use the 3D Touch functionality for “virtual” on-screen keys. Interestingly, the publication suggests the Korean phonemaker will likely integrate the pressure-sensitive display tech much more extensively in future releases – like the Galaxy Note 8, for instance. This is hardly the first time Samsung has been said to be toying around with pressure-sensitive panel solutions. The company was previously expected to introduce the feature to the Galaxy S7 and more recently to its S8 descendant. This latest report simply adds more credence to the speculation. The South Korean behemoth is slated to unveil its new flagship device later this month on March 29 – but you will have to wait till late April to actually get your hands on one. on The Investor Read next: Scary interactive map shows how water levels will rise due to global warming GeariPhoneSamsung Share on Facebook (121) Share on Twitter (218) Mix is a reporter from Amsterdam.

The partnership saw Apple purchase the land and use the paper from the forests for sustainable product packaging, with the company claiming that “forests stay forests” and harvested timber is done so in a sustainable way. Two years later, The Conservation Fund is offering some details on the effects of the partnership with Apple and says that the return it is showing, especially in the 3,600 acres located in North Carolina… Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case As outlined by Bizjournals, Apple harvested 13,000 metric tons of wood in 2016 while protecting the 36,000 acres in its entirety. The collective annual production of the two forests Apple purchased in North Carolina and Maine was “equivalent to about 30 percent of the virgin fiber” that Apple had used in product packaging in 2015. Furthermore, the partnership between Apple and The Conservation Fund has created more than “10 jobs per 1,000-acres” in the Brunswick Forest portion of the project. Additionally, The Conservation Fund has planted 185,000 trees across 300 acres of the forest “because it provides a home for a rare butterfly.” Additionally, the partnership as also protected natural resources: And it has also protected North Carolina natural resources.

Dan Wheat Capital Press Published on March 15, 2017 4:01PM Courtesy of Washington Apple Commission Conceptual overseas point-of-sale promotional banner of Washington apple logo surrounded by logos of individual shippers. WENATCHEE, Wash. — The Washington Apple Commission is looking at reallocating export promotional dollars and increasing Washington apple brand identity overseas by encouraging more shippers to use the Washington apple logo. It’s an effort to meet increased international competition brought on by more production in Europe, elsewhere in the U.S. and in other countries and Russia’s ban on Western produce. The ban, begun on Aug. 7, 2014, was in retaliation for Western sanctions on Russia for its aggression in Ukraine. “I was in Asia two weeks ago and saw Canadian apples in markets there for the first time in 15 years,” Todd Fryhover, commission president, said at a commission meeting in Wenatchee on March 14. “The French are upping their game. South Africa is there (in Asia) again. It’s really competitive out there,” Fryhover said. “We’ve had good years and now things are evolving within the industry and internationally so Red Delicious and Gala are struggling,” he said. By reducing promotional funding for Central America, Thailand, Malaysia/Singapore, Taiwan, the Middle East and Colombia/Peru to 2012 levels, the commission can save $700,000 to be reallocated elsewhere, Fryhover told commissioners. That would reduce the funding to $187,000 to $387,000 per country annually versus the current level of $260,000 to $550,000. The commission’s Foreign Trade Committee will consider the reallocations at its May 18 meeting in advance of the next commission budget meeting on May 25. The commission is budgeted to spend $7.6 million this year on export promotions with $5.1 million of that coming from the federal Market Access Program — known by the acronym MAP — and $2.5 million from grower assessments. More than $1 million each is budgeted on promotions in Mexico and India. China/Hong Kong, Vietnam and Indonesia follow as top targets with between $550,000 and $875,000 each. Fryhover said he’s concerned about the future of MAP funding and that the commission has funding that can be used to keep promotions at the $7.6 million level for the next couple of years. The Russian embargo has shifted European apple exports to Asia and the Middle East, increasing competition there for China, the U.S., Chile and New Zealand. The commission slashed its promotions in Russia from more than $300,000 before the embargo to $11,000, and Fryhover is recommending eliminating that. Washington exports to Russia peaked at 921,558, 40-pound boxes in 2007 and was 598,028 boxes in 2013. It has been zero since the embargo. The commission passed a motion supporting use of the Washington apple logo on all varieties shipped into all markets. About 70 percent of shippers already use the logo on price look-up stickers on apples being exported but it would be good to have everyone doing it to build the Washington brand, Fryhover said. Oneonta Starr Ranch Growers in Wenatchee and Yakima Fresh and Sage Fruit Co. in Yakima are moving toward using the logo, he said. Fryhover also displayed conceptual Point of Sale materials of the logo surrounded by the individual logos of 23 marketers. It’s a way of including everyone in promotions, he said. Commissioner Frank Davis, vice president of business development of Domex Superfresh Growers in Yakima, said the industry needs to build its international identity if it’s going to get to 60 million boxes in exports. In 2014, the Washington industry exported a record 50.6 million boxes, which represented 35.5 percent of the year’s record crop. Normally, exports are 30 million to 35 million boxes.

But all three had something more in common than their publisher: the iPhone.  More and more hospitals are using — and studying — the iPhone as an integral medical tool. Often through Apple's ResearchKit framework, which lets novice developers easily build apps for medical research, doctors and researchers are combining the study of technology with the study of disease.   SEE ALSO: In hospitals, Apple's app platform becoming a force In the the latest of these studies, published Monday in Nature Biotechnology, scientists at Mount Sinai Hospital's Icahn School of Medicine in New York tested the use of smartphones in medical research through a study of asthma patients. The study used a mobile app, downloaded by 50,000 iPhone users, to survey people with asthma. Not everyone who downloaded the Asthma Health App — designed for the study through ResearchKit — actually had asthma and was eligible to participate, but about 7,500 of the 50,000 did enroll. About 2,300 completed multiple surveys about their asthma symptoms over a six-month period.  "The tech part of this is perhaps more important," said principal investigator Yvonne Chan, director of digital health and personalized medicine at a Mount Sinai institute. "The more important takeaway is that clinical research has been done the same way for centuries. It really is changing, revolutionizing how clinical research is being conducted."  Researchers compared the results of the surveys to existing studies of asthma patients. The findings matched what they'd seen in other asthma studies, and even provided new information correlating asthma symptoms with external factors, like heat, pollen and a wildfire outbreak in Washington State.  "Research used to be a rigid, stodgy process," Chan said. "We are figuring out how to scale that and do it better in different ways."  With a mobile study, the researchers were able to reach a more diverse group of patients than in studies conducted the traditional way. For example, survey respondents were sicker than the group researchers can usually reach, Chan explained. They had higher rates of hospitalization and emergency department visits than Centers for Disease Control rates for asthma patients. But the study pointed out that this method of research is still in its early stages and presents some drawbacks. Because participants self-report their own data, some values are often missing. And the study was prone to dropoff in participants over time, like any study requiring people to open an app of their own volition.  Apple's push into health care, too, has brought up concerns for some customers about privacy, in terms of both Apple Watch health data and data relating to more official medical information.  Still, as the iPhone gains more legitimacy in medical circles, Apple's relevance in the health care space grows. The tech company has kicked off its major push into health, collecting data from insurance-sponsored Apple Watches and apps developed through CareKit, ResearchKit's twin for consumer-facing health apps.  SEE ALSO: Apple's push into healthcare now includes Apple Watch data Past studies involving the iPhone and ResearchKit have focused on the scientific outcomes, like the correlation between stress and seizures found through Apple Watch data. In Mount Sinai's study, the conclusions about asthma itself were almost incidental. Instead, the real findings were how feasible mobile app-based studies could be for researchers in the future.  "Looking forward, the potential of ubiquitous smartphone technology to address the needs of clinical research to better understand health and disease appears to be more promising than ever," researchers wrote in the study.  WATCH: Change up your living space with these building blocks Reblog Share Tweet Share What to Read Next Test your PC building skills with the new PC Building Simulator Digital Trends Don't Buy Furniture Until You See This Site WayfairSponsored Samsung is reportedly making a second, more powerful Galaxy S8… but you can’t have it BGR News New navigation app has an awesome feature I’ve always wanted in Google Maps BGR News

After all this would mark the first time that Apple has stuck to a similar-ish design for three-generations worth of iPhones, leading many to call them “boring”. However despite that, there is still a certain level of appeal to them, which is why we’re not surprised at Kantar’s latest report. According to a report from Kantar Worldpanel, they have found that based on smartphones sales around the world that Apple’s iPhone 7, despite being called boring, is doing quite well and is actually the top-selling smartphone in markets like the US, Europe, and urban China, or so they claim. Based on their numbers, Apple’s iOS market share actually grew in some of those markets. For example in the US, the market share of iOS is at 42% which actually represents a 2.9% increase from the previous year at the same time which was at 39.1%. In Europe iOS also saw an increase in market share from 20.3% to 22.7%. As for China, Kantar was careful to specify that they meant urban China in which the iPhone 7 is doing well. This is because in tier 2 and tier 3 cities which are more rural, Apple’s market share is being ceded to the likes of Android, and as an overall, Apple lost 8.4% of their market share in China. That being said, we have to wonder with this year’s iPhone predicted to launch another super cycle for Apple, how will those numbers look like? Filed in Apple >Cellphones.

Japanese blog Macotakara says that the 9.7-inch iPad Pro 2 would be the first Apple product released this year. But before you get your hopes up, it says that the new 9.7-inch iPad Pro will be a modest upgrade over the original, with no external design changes whatsoever. The report says that the 9.7-inch iPad Pro 2 will include an A10X chip which will include better CPU and graphics performance. Adding an “X” chip to the new iPad makes sense, however. As Apple has a history of updating their iPads with “X” versions of the iPhone chip. For example, the current generation iPads boast an A9X chip which corresponds to the A9 released with the iPhone 6s. Tags: A10X, iPad Pro About Peter Cao Peter has a passion for music and technology.

Now, RBC analyst Amit Daryanani has expressed his own bullish attitude towards AAPL, but his expectations are based almost entirely on Apple’s Services sector. Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case In a note to investors, obtained by Barron’s, Daryanani explained that Apple’s Services category could be a $50 billion business by the 2020 fiscal year. The analyst explained that one of the biggest benefits of Services is that it converts sales into profit at a higher rate than the rest of Apple’s sectors. Specifically, Daryanani wrote that he sees the strongest potential for upside if Apple continues to “increase its mix of higher margin, less cyclical services over time.” Daryanani is essentially saying that Apple should rely more on the higher margin Services than on hardware, which is released at a regular cycle, like the iPhone being released every fall. “We see potential for upside to Apple’s current valuation if the company were to continue to increase its mix of higher margin, less cyclical services revenue over time,” Daryanani wrote. He thinks investors could be willing to pay 17 times each dollar of earnings. Apple’s profit-to-earnings multiple currently is closer to 15. Based on his bullish attitude towards Services, Daryanani raised his target price for AAPL to $155 from $140. For comparison’s sake, AAPL closed at $140.46 today. Daryanani’s predictions for AAPL come on the heels of several other prominent analysts who have expressed optimism towards the company’s future, largely thanks to the upcoming iPhone 8. Kate Huberty of Morgan Stanley yesterday predicted that Apple would see unit sales rise 20 percent in fiscal 2018 because of the iPhone 8. Citi also raised its target AAPL price from $140 to $160 based on the iPhone 8 “super cycle.” Apple itself has put an intensified focus on Services throughout the past year due to slowing hardware sales. Speaking at a Goldman Sachs event last month, Apple CFO Luca Maestri stated that Services is currently the size of a Fortune 100 company and that Apple expects to double it over the course of the next four years. During Q1 2017, Apple reported Services revenue of $7.2 billion, up 18 percent year-over-year.

More Masthead About Lawfare Comments Policy Subscribe to Lawfare The Job Board Calendar Going Dark The FBI and I Agree By Susan Landau Wednesday, March 15, 2017, 4:54 PM Google+ Reddit LinkedIn DayZero: Cybersecurity Law and Policy Last year when I testified in the House Judiciary Committee on the Apple/FBI case, I argued that what the FBI was asking for would create a serious security risk for Apple. It seems the FBI agrees. In a case about releasing information regarding unlocking a phone, the FBI presented a brief arguing that the security risks means it should not be required to release information about the company that unlocked the phone. Let me back up a little and remind you of the facts. After the terrorist shootings in San Bernardino, the FBI took possession of a phone belonging to the San Bernardino Health Department and issued to Syed Rizwan Farook, one of the terrorists. The phone, an Apple iPhone running iOS 9.0, was locked. Apple's security protections meant that each time a user guessed an incorrect PIN, there was an increasing delay before another attempt could be made to unlock the phone. And after ten incorrect tries, the operating system would erase the phone's data. The FBI wanted Apple to issue an update, particularized to Farook's phone, that would undo these protections. Then law-enforcement agents could brute force PIN tries until they were unable to unlock the device.The FBI argued that Apple could do the update securely. But during last year's hearing, FBI Director James Comey and Manhattan DA Cy Vance revealed they had a number of phones they wanted unlocked (the number is now in the many hundreds). And therein lies the rub. Apple would not be doing a single update to Farook's iPhone. It would be employing these updates over and over again, particularized to each phone for which law enforcement had a search warrant. It would be very hard to protect the software, which, after all, could not be written, used once, and then destroyed. And the updates themselves, instead of being done a few times a year, would be used frequently, putting the process itself at risk. As I said during the hearing: [R]outinizing the signing process will make it too easy to subvert Apple's process and download malware onto customers' devices. My concern is not that the FBI will download rogue software updates onto unsuspecting customers; there is a rigorous wiretap warrant process to prevent government wiretaps from being abused. Rather, I am concerned that routinization will make it too easy for a sophisticated enemy, whether organized crime or a nation attempting an Advanced Persistent Threat attack, to mislead the Apple signing process. A process that is used rarely—such is now the case in signing updates—is a process that can be carefully scrutinized each time it occurs; the chance for malfeasance is low. But make things routine, and instead of several senior people being involved in the signing process, a web form is used, and a low-level employee is placed in charge of code signing. Scrutiny diminishes. No one pays a great deal of attention, and it becomes easy for rogue requests to be slipped into the queue. Or worse. The software would be a prime target of hackers and foreign governments, who would like nothing better than to acquire software enabling them to hack iPhones. What the FBI was asking for was, from a security vantage point, too dangerous for Apple to build. Apparently, the FBI sees the same threat—but to the vendor of the company that unlocked the phone for the bureau. In a brief arguing that the government should not have to release the company's name, the brief states: [R]evealing the vendor's identity immediately exposes the vendor to attacks and infiltration by hostile entities wishing to exploit the technology they provided to the FBI. While FBI networks are protected by sophisticated cyber-security measures and FBI facilities are protected by armed guards and/or sophisticated physical security measures, the vendor likely does not have the same resources to devote to its own security. With this in mind, the FBI would be taking a substantial risk to the continued viability of this technology by acknowledging the vendor ... It is reasonable to conclude that [the vendor] would not be able to thwart the same types of attacks and infiltration attempts the FBI is currently able to defend against; thus, revealing the vendor's identity may provide hostile enemies with a softer target for attack and infiltration ... Asking Apple to develop software to undo the iPhone's security carries a much greater risk than this, for it would not only be the particular update software under threat. The more serious risk would be to Apple's update authorization mechanism. And so, the FBI has just made a very strong argument as to why Apple should not be compelled to break its own security.

Model: Circle with Disney Price: $99 Compatibility: Can filter content from all iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch devices; Management app requires iOS 8.1 or later Share This Article: By Jesse Hollington @jhollington ● 1 day ago Jesse Hollington Internet-enabled iPhones, iPads, and iPod touch devices have made households more connected than ever, and a lot of families have moved away from the "one shared family computer" of days gone by into a situation where young kids may have their own iPods or shared iPads, and pre-teens and teens likely even have their own iPhones, all with the ability to independently access the Internet. While Apple does a pretty good job of offering parental restrictions, these have to be configured on each device specifically, and of course only apply to Apple's own devices; throw a few PCs or other non-Apple devices into the mix, and you're left trying to reconcile a confusing set of parental control options that will differ on every platform. This is where Circle Media's Circle with Disney ($99) comes into play — it's a simple box that connects to your Wi-Fi network to monitor and supervise your family's Internet activity, both in terms of where each member of your household can go, and how much time they're allowed to spend online. There’s really not much to Circle’s hardware, and that’s kind of the point; in the box you get the Circle unit itself — a relatively unobtrusive white cube that you can leave anywhere within a reasonable range of your Wi-Fi network — along with a power adapter and an Ethernet cable for those users who prefer to use a wired connection. Circle isn’t intended to replace your Wi-Fi router, but instead becomes another device on your network, essentially intercepting any traffic bound for the Internet so it can apply it’s own filtering rules (if you’re curious about the technical details, Circle uses a technique known as ARP Spoofing to accomplish its magic). As a result, Circle can monitor and intercept traffic from any device on your home network, regardless of whether it’s on a Wi-Fi or wired Ethernet connection, and regardless of which Wi-Fi band it uses; the only exception is that in some cases it won’t work with “guest” networks that can be set up on some routers, but we don’t really consider this to be a problem as it’s designed to monitor and manage your own family’s Internet access; in these cases you’ll just need to disable or lock down your guest network if you don’t want to make it too easy for your kids to bypass Circle’s filtering capabilities. It’s also worth mentioning that since the filtering works at the network communications level, no additional software needs to be installed on any of your devices. Setting up Circle is simply a matter of plugging it in and loading up the companion iOS app, which will guide you through the process of pairing it to your Wi-Fi network, applying any necessary firmware updates, and creating a a Circle account with your phone number for authentication purposes — the final stage involves texting a four-digit access code to you via SMS to connect to the Circle; you can later give other family members access to manage Circle’s settings by having them install the app and providing them with the access code that gets sent to your phone. The initial hardware set up was very straightforward, although we were a bit disappointed that Circle required us to manually flip over to the iOS Settings app a couple of times, rather than using the more modern in-app Wi-Fi setup APIs, however while worth mentioning, it really wasn’t that big of a problem. Once Circle has joined your Wi-FI network and you’ve set up your account, Circle will then take you through the process of setting up at least one initial family member. For each user, you’ll be prompted to add a name and photo to identity the family member (while the photo is optional, the Circle app is very graphical, so it’s a good idea to use one), assign one of five different pre-defined filter levels, set a bedtime, and then assign devices to that user. Four filter levels are provided to correspond to age groups — Pre-K, Kid, Teen, and Adult — with appropriate default content filters for each, while a fifth option —  None — allows you to exempt that user’s devices entirely from any filtering or monitoring. Once you’re done adding family members, the Circle app will prompt you to select any devices that you want to be completely unmanaged by Circle, such as smart home devices, and will even attempt to identify these devices and pre-select them for you. Lastly, a “Home” profile is set up so you can apply general filters for devices that are used by the whole family; all new devices that join your network in the future will automatically be associated with this “Home” profile by default until you assign them elsewhere. While each of the filter levels offers pre-defined controls appropriate for each age group, you can customize them individually for each family member to allow or block certain services and sites. A list of pre-defined “Platforms” such as Amazon, Disney, FaceTime, Hulu, Netflix, YouTube, etc., is included to allow you to easily turn those services on or off without having to know all of the various URLs that are used behind the scenes, followed by a list of predefined content categories that can be switched on and off, and a “Privacy and Safety” section allowing you to block ads and force Safe Search in Google and Restricted mode in YouTube. The younger filter levels also mandatorily block certain content categories — for example, the “Pre-K” level automatically blocks everything except for the “Kids” category, with Safe Search and ad-blocking enabled by default, while the “Kid” level automatically filters out social media sites. However, custom filters can be added at any level to either block or permit access to specific sites by URL. In addition to filtering content, Circle also supports several features to control screen time. Each user can have a “BedTime” specified, which will cut off all Internet access from their devices at the specified time each day and an “OffTime” setting that allows you to block access to the Internet during specific time frames, on specific days of the week. Daily time limits can also be set up for each family member, controlling not only how much time they can spend online overall each day, but how much time they can spend performing specific online activities; the same filter platforms and categories appear here, so you could for example limit a child to only being on YouTube for 30 minutes and Netflix for 60 minutes each day, while not restricting their time using FaceTime or educational web sites at all. A “Pause” button in each user profile also allows you to manually suspend and resume that member’s Internet access at any time. An “Insights” section shows a breakdown of how much time that family member has spent on each platform or in each category, summarized by day, week, or month, along with a breakdown of which web sites they’ve visited in each category. A detailed “History” view is also available to provide a list of which sites have been visited and which have been filtered. Note that for users with filters set to “None,” traffic can still be paused entirely, and bedtime and time-of-day restrictions can be applied, but platform/category time limits cannot be used and insights will not be available. Family members trying to access blocked content through a web browser will be taken to a custom “dashboard” page telling them that they’ve been blocked and providing them with a snapshot of their daily usage, bedtimes, time limits, and so forth, followed by a collection of “safe” links that they can visit — all from Disney, of course. However, that’s the best-case scenario when accessing a typical site in a web browser. If you try to hit a blocked site that normally uses an HTTPS connection, your browser will more or less complain that your session is being hijacked (since it technically is), and of course trying to access blocked Internet services with specific apps will generally result in “No Connection” errors or possibly even more inscrutable messages, depending on the app involved. Of course, this is mostly just a question of aesthetics, and there’s little Circle can do here as it’s controlling the traffic and not the app; regardless of the error messages that the user sees, the desired end result is being achieved here in making sure they can’t access those particular parts of the Internet. A “My Circle” iOS app is available that can optionally be installed on your family’s iPads, iPhones, and iPod touch devices to provide a dashboard along with some notifications for things like time limits, but it won’t really help with error messages. One important limitation to keep in mind here as well is that Circle filters per-device not per-user. The users in the Circle system are associated with specific hardware devices, and filters are applied to those devices regardless of who is using them. So if you have a family-shared iPad, or family-shared computer, you’ll either have to keep a fairly permissive set of filters configured for it or be content to toggle the filter settings depending on who is using it. Obviously this will be less of an issue if a shared device like an iPad is only used by family members in the same age group, although you’ll still run into issues if you’re planning to try and set time limits or monitor who went where. About the only big feature we felt was missing here was the ability to vary filters based on time of day, rather than just setting outright time limits for each type of content. Currently, Circle’s time limits are an “all or nothing” feature, but it would be nice if there were a way to provide more restrictive filters for certain times of the day to allow kids to access the Internet to do homework while still otherwise limiting their opportunities for distraction from non-work-related sites and apps. That said, Circle is primarily a software platform tied into a hardware device, and the company has shown an impressive willingness to add interesting new features, so we wouldn’t rule it out entirely. In fact, one such feature that Circle has recently announced is its expanded “Rewards” integrations. Circle offers a “Rewards” button whereby you can manually reward a family member by exempting them from time limits, OffTimes, or extend their bedtime, a recent update has laid the groundwork for a whole set of tie-ins with third-party apps to automatically unlock rewards and other possibilities. Kids can earn screen time by completing chores tracked using apps such as ChoreMonster, Mothershp, and Landra, and by meeting activity goals tracked with Misfit trackers, effectively turning screen time into a form of digital currency for kids. Other integrations include IFTTT support that will allow a wide variety of smart home apps and other things to be tied into Circle in both directions, turning lights on or off at a child’s bedtime, using a physical device as a “Pause” button, and even rewarding a child when something is checked off a to-do list. Circle is also adding Amazon Alexa integration so parents and kids can ask questions about usage time, time limits, and bedtimes, integration with Automatic to encourage safe driving by teens by filtering out specific distracting apps when the vehicle is running, and RAKKOON social network monitoring to alert parents and kids when questionable activity is happening on social networks, and auto-filter those apps when too much content is flagged. For our more technical readers, it’s also worth adding that while Circle does impact network performance a bit for those devices that are being filtered, it’s surprisingly not that bad. You’ll definitely notice a difference if you’re running an 802.11ac router with a 200mbps+ Internet connection simply due to the fact that Circle only supports 802.11n Wi-Fi, but for the most part it’s not something that most families should need to be concerned about. Circle also provides an Ethernet cable in the box if you’d prefer to hardwire the device, but we found no need to do so, even on our relatively congested Wi-Fi network. In our speed tests, throughput over 802.11ac from our MacBook Pro and iPhone 7 Plus was cut in half due to being forced down to 802.11n speeds, but we couldn’t find any measurable performance drop from any of our 802.11n devices. The good news, however, is that Circle only ARP spoofs devices where filtering is required. Those devices that have been completely exempted, and even those that are assigned to a user with filtering set to “None” will still send traffic directly to your router, unless that user’s traffic is manually paused or in a “BedTime” or “OffTime” window. We confirmed this by manually checking the ARP caches on several client devices in our testing — the original MAC address of our router appeared when filtering was set to “None” for that user, and updated to the MAC address of the Circle when any filters were applied to that user, or even simply when their Internet activity was manually paused. So in other words, if you’re concerned about Circle causing a performance hit there’s no need to worry at all — it’s essentially a passive device on your network for anything that’s not being specifically filtered, and chances are that most users won’t be applying filters to those devices where maximum throughput is desired. Circle does a great job delivering on what it promises to do, as long as you go into it understanding that no system is foolproof, and Circle shouldn’t ever be considered a substitute for responsible parenting. While Circle has been designed to handle most obvious attempts to bypass it — for example, an internal battery will keep it running for several hours even if a clever kid thinks they can just unplug it — there’s still nothing here that a determined tech-savvy teenager won’t figure out how to work around, and that’s coming from someone who was a very determined tech-savvy teenager in his own day. Further, if your kids have devices such as iPhones and iPads that provide cellular capabilities, or your neighbours have open Wi-Fi networks, all bets are pretty much off on being able to completely lock them down. Circle offers its companion “Circle Go” VPN-based service for those situations, but unlike the one-time purchase of the Circle hardware device, you’ll pay $10/month for Circle Go, although that one monthly fee covers up to ten devices. However, our take is that it’s best to see Circle in light of the old maxim that “locks are for honest people.” If you’re looking to “lock down” a rebellious or wayward teenager, this device is not going to solve your problems (although it still might be a useful tool in your arsenal). On the flip side, however, it may be exactly what you’re looking for if you just want to keep moderately curious young kids from stumbling into the darker corners of the Internet — something that can happen frighteningly easily these days if you simply give them unfettered access to a web browser and YouTube. Circle is a well-implemented solution that can definitely go a long way to helping you monitor and control your family’s Internet use, especially if you’re got younger kids with Wi-Fi-only devices, which, especially in light of the Disney branding, is who we really feel this device is targeted at anyway.   Comments Although I'm not familiar with Roblox, I'd suggest contacting their customer support, who can perhaps provide you with the specific names so that you can add them to custom filters. The fact that it's being filtered even when the filter is set to "Adult" is particularly odd, as it would suggest that the servers that Roblox is using have somehow been caught up in a very restrictive filter by Circle, as at the "Adult" level only explicit adult sites and dangerous sites should technically be blocked. Posted by Jesse Hollington on 2017-03-16 12:53:46 Been using Circle for a while now (>1 year), and it's generally great. Lately, I've had problems with the filters, however. It seems to block all Roblox servers, no matter what filter (Kid/Teen/Adult) I'm on. The only time Roblox games work is with Filter set to 'None'. This means we can no longer track or filter anything for my son, who loves Roblox. Anyone else have this problem? Setting a custom filter for Roblox.com doesn't help - it's the custom servers that run the games that are the problem.... Circle customer service was not helpful.

Those were some of the top requested features when we asked you prior to its launch, so now we want to know what features or hardware upgrades you’re most anticipating for the Apple Watch 3 expected later this year. The best 4K & 5K displays for Mac Earlier today, we commented on how Apple Watch Series 3 could solve a few key problems with the current user experience by adding cellular connectivity. That’s one upgrade that could certainly be a standout new feature for a future Apple Watch. It would enable the Watch to act independently of the iPhone and become a true standalone device after adding more independence with Series 2 and its standalone GPS chip. Beyond those possibilities, top requested features last time we asked you included new health sensors and sleep tracking, followed by a Smart Straps platform, which would connect to the device to allow for integrated batteries and or sensors as add-ons. Coming in last in our last poll was a FaceTime camera. While there isn’t a whole lot yet rumored for the next-generation Apple Watch, there are a few hints that some of the above could be in the cards. Earlier this year we noted that Apple was granted a patent for health sensors, cameras, batteries & more in bracelet links, which would allow for the above Smart Strap-type platform. There are also a few things that have been rumored before, including sleep tracking. And features that we could only imagine both customers and Apple wouldn’t be mad if possible to achieve in time for the next release, like a thinner and lighter design, or a better battery that might facilitate features like an always-on display or just longer time in between charging. We recently ran down these and more rumors, supply chain chatter, and other possibilities in our look at what’s next for Apple Watch: How sleep tracking, cellular, and an always-on display could be major improvements. So, with that in mind, what is YOUR top requested feature for the next-generation Apple Watch?

Recent reports have claimed that Apple will adopt OLED panels - matching major rivals, like Samsung - for its future iPhones, with the most recent news coming from The Investor, which said Samsung's display-making unit, Samsung Display, is currently developing a pressure-sensitive OLED touch display for the iPhone 8. That means the OLED screen should support 3D Touch/Force Touch. The first OLED iPhone is expected to debut in September, so Samsung Display, which is reportedly Apple's sole OLED supplier, has been ramping up efforts to integrate 3D Touch into the screen. Samsung’s new flagship smartphone, the Galaxy S8, is also expected to partly use 3D Touch. The company is said to be ditching a physical home button in favour of a virtual one on the display screen. Best upcoming smartphones: The phones to look forward to in 2017 New Apple iPhone SE might be on the way, hints leaked Target memo Apple is 'looking into' this video of an exploding iPhone 7 Plus On a separate note, Nikkei Asian Review has claimed Apple's premium iPhone 8 model will feature a curved OLED display. Remember, the company is rumoured to be working on three iPhone models, with the third one introducing a new design and screen size. This curve will reportedly be gentler than the curved screens used in Samsung's Galaxy S7 Edge, but it won't offer any major functions. So, you shouldn’t expect gimmicky features like the ability to receive texts on the side of the phone.

Hollyscoop Duration: 02:11 1 day ago SHARE SHARE TWEET SHARE EMAIL Taylor Swift world domination? Yes, yes indeed. The singer is launching her very own streaming service to rival Apple Music and Spotify. Cause like I said, Taylor is focused on world domination at this point! I kid! But really, the pop star IS making plans for this streaming service. According to TMZ, the site will be called Swifties and will be offering quote “Non downloadable multi media content in the nature of audio recordings.” In addition the site will offer a line of Taylor Swift music products including guitars, picks, straps, drumsticks, and even online music courses. Now this news comes on the heels of Taylor’s now infamous feud with Apple Music and Spotify. Remember that? Back in 2015, Spotify began offering her music to their costumers for free, without giving her any royalties - and they did this to all their artists. Taylor fired back by removing her entire catalog from the site. Apple music made a similar move. They offered music for free to their customers during a free 3 month trial period. Taylor again removed her music from the streaming site. She even penned an open letter to the tech company. I find it to be shocking, disappointing, and completely unlike this historically progressive and generous company she wrote. These are the echoed sentiments of every artist, writer and producer in my social circles who are afraid to speak up publicly because we admire and respect apple so much. Now Apple actually went on to listen to Taylor and fix their site, and Taylor went on to star in many apple music commercials. So what’s gonna happen when she launches her own streaming site? Well, we bet she won’t be promoting apple anymore. But also remember, that Jay Z tried something similar when he launched his streaming service Tidal. The initial debut was met with scathing reviews. Now the site boasts 3 million subscribers, but it’s a fraction of apple and spotify. They have 11 million and 30 million paid subscribers respectively So you tell me, are you excited about Taylor’s new streaming venture or are you like me, and just want another album?

Beth Mole - Mar 15, 2017 9:03 pm UTC Enlarge / Flat line alert on a heart monitor - 3d render on detailed pixellated screen. Getty | johan63 reader comments 21 Share this story There are three billion smartphones bouncing inside pockets and bags around the world. Their owners are often within arm's reach 24-7. With such ubiquity, constant usage, and connectivity, researchers have publicly drooled over the potential for mobile devices to become gushing conduits of health information. They could wirelessly and effortlessly provide data on patients’ symptoms, the success or failure of new treatments, and the progression of diseases—streamlining clinical trials, research, and personalized care. The potential is there. But reality is not, according to a study published this week in Nature Biotechnology. Tracking the effectiveness of an asthma health app created using Apple’s ResearchKit, researchers reported problems with participant selection bias, extremely low participant retention, missing data, and data security. “These issues require attention to realize the full potential of mobile platforms in research and patient care,” the authors, led by Joel Dudley and Eric Schadt of Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, concluded. Still, they remained optimistic. “Looking forward, the potential of ubiquitous smartphone technology to address the needs of clinical research to better understand health and disease appears to be more promising than ever,” they added. Both Dudley and Schadt hold stock in LifeMap Solutions, Inc., the company that helped develop the health app. One of the most striking findings of their look at the utility of the app for research was the low user retention. The app was designed to help monitor and control participants' asthma symptoms, as well as feed researchers data. The app harvested user-generated data using daily, weekly, and less-frequent “milestone” asthma symptom surveys. It also provided participants with medical information, plus gave reminders and notifications relevant to asthma management. In the US, 40,683 people downloaded the app (mostly after a big, splashy Apple unveiling). Of those, 7,593 people enrolled in the study. But from there, only 131 participants took at least a week’s worth of surveys and a six-month milestone survey. That’s 1.7 percent. Such dismal retention echoes what other health apps have experienced. But even if more of the participants provided more data, it’s unclear if it would be helpful to researchers. Compared with a study cohort of asthma patients that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention rounded up for research, the app users “tended to be younger, wealthier, more educated, and were more often male.” So the findings wouldn’t have been generalizable. This is somewhat expected, since the study was selecting among the subgroup of people who have smartphones. But the app users also had higher rates of asthma-related hospitalizations and emergency room visits compared with the CDC cohort, suggesting that the app users may have had more severe or less controlled asthma. Otherwise, the researchers reported stumbles in collecting data. Due to technical issues, they only collected age and/or gender data from 1,398 participants. Only 545 frequent app users consented to giving up geolocation data, making it difficult for researchers to compare symptom prevalence with environmental factors, such as pollen counts and air quality. Together, it’s difficult to draw any conclusions about how the app might have helped asthma sufferers or researchers. The authors did note that of the 173 users who filled out a “milestone” survey, the number of people who reported that their asthma was uncontrolled dropped from 42 to 24 percent. In the future, the researchers say health app designers should get better at making apps engaging and perhaps more reliant on passive data collection, like movement. It might also help if device-based research offered financial or other incentives, which is typical for traditional clinical trials. The researchers also speculated that the apps could be helpful as a tool within traditional clinical trials. For now, they say, these apps alone may be most suited for only a narrow type of research. A type that: presents minimal risk to participants, allowing the use of electronic consent; has a hypothesis that can be answered in three weeks or less; relies on data collection that is passive; has no assumption that results will be generalizable; and has a statistical analysis plan to deal with low retention and lots of missing data.

If Japanese analysts are to be asked, however, they believe Tim Cook’s company will be unveiling the 9.7-inch iPad Pro 2 as early as next week. Just this Wednesday, Japanese blog Mac Otakara published a report about Apple’s alleged plan for the 9.7-inch iPad Pro successor. The blog, citing local analysts’ predictions, stated that Apple could be launching the new tablet next week. This prediction seems suspicious, however, because the analysts did not provide the reason. Also, there hasn’t been any information confirming that Samsung’s biggest rival has scheduled a media event for the said week. Mac Otakara’s report was its response to MacRumors’ previous story about a research firm’s statement concerning the launch of the new Apple products. The well-known firm reportedly claimed that Cook’s company is announcing new products in the week that starts on March 20. However, the firm did not mention which products would these be. MacRumors has already published an updated story and this time it is saying that the 9.7-inch iPad Pro will likely be announced via a press release and not at a formal launch event. Backing up this new claim, the Apple-centric news site said there isn’t a need to hold a press event for something that’s just an iterative upgrade. After all, the new 9.7-inch iPad Pro 2 is very similar to the original one save for the inclusion of a faster Apple A10x chip and the addition of quad microphones. In addition to the 9.7-inch model, Apple is also believed to be introducing a new 12.9-inch iPad Pro and a new line of iPads with 10.5-inch displays. For the 10.5-inch model, it is being speculated to have the same form factor as the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. The only noticeable difference is the reduced size of the bezels to accommodate the larger screen, as per Apple Insider. There are also rumblings that Apple is preparing to launch a red iPhone 7, a 128GB iPhone SE and new models of the Apple Watch smartwatch. Whether these three will be introduced alongside the 9.7-inch iPad Pro 2 via a press release or not is still unknown. What’s certain is that Apple will unlikely wait for WWDC 2017 in June to announce them. Apple is said to announce its 9.7-inch iPad Pro next week.

Alongside its March 25th unveiling, Apple is also inviting customers to their Nanjing Jinmao and Schildergasse location openings. All three of the new store pages include invitations for their respective grand openings at 10 AM on March 25th. While not yet listed on the Brickell City Centre’s shop directory, the new Miami store’s page is on Apple’s website and is set to be the largest in the state. The shopping mall contains an open-air design built to facilitate natural climate control thanks to the nearby Biscayne Bay. Both the Nanjing Jinmao and Schildergasse stores already have a list of upcoming events and workshops, although registration for these looks temporarily disabled ahead of the grand opening. We can most likely expect that these new stores will be fashioned with the Jony Ive aesthetics.  At past Apple store launch events, Apple has celebrated the event by giving away shirts for some of the early customers.

The issue was a bit of a black eye for Apple, considering the company recently elected to exit the display market and instead partnered with LG on the new 27-inch UltraFine 5K and its smaller sibling, the 21.5-inch UltraFine 4K. We purchased one of the original UltraFine 5K units back in December, with our model carrying a manufacturing month of November 2016 based on its serial number. LG has now provided us with a unit manufactured last month after the design revisions were put in place, and we've had a few days to compare the performance of the two units in the presence of Wi-Fi routers. In day-to-day usage, we failed to see any issues with the original model, even with an AirPort Time Capsule located just three feet from the display, inside the two-meter radius LG recommended users should keep as a minimum once the company discovered the issue. We were, however, able to induce the issue in the unit by bringing another Time Capsule into very close proximity with the rear of the display, causing it to flicker and disconnect from the host computer. The display sometimes reconnected to the computer on its own once the interference was removed, but other times it required that the Thunderbolt 3 cable be briefly unplugged or even the entire UltraFine 5K be power cycled before it would reconnect. With the revised UltraFine 5K Display in hand, we've been able to subject both displays to side-by-side testing that confirms the issue has been successfully addressed. While the issue is easily reproducible on the original model as long as the Wi-Fi router is in close enough proximity, we were unable to recreate the issue on the revised model despite extensive efforts. With Apple once again shipping the UltraFine 5K Display, new orders are currently showing in-stock availability in Apple's U.S. online store, although Personal Pickup remains unavailable. Apple's discounted pricing on the display of $974 is scheduled to run through the end of this month, at which time the display will return to its normal $1299.95 price. Apple already extended its discounted pricing on USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 accessories once and it's possible the promotion could again be extended, but for those who want to make sure they receive the discounted pricing, they should be sure to order by March 31. Customers purchasing the UltraFine 5K Display, regardless of what vendor they use, should make sure they are receiving revised units to ensure they are protected from the Wi-Fi interference issue. The first three digits of the display's serial number (visible on the exterior of the box) correspond to the last digit of the year and the two-digit month of manufacture, so buyers should look for serial numbers starting with 702 or 703. Those who purchased earlier units may be eligible for repairs if their units are exhibiting the interference issue, and affected customers should contact LG or Apple for information on repair procedures. We've arranged for a repair of our affected unit through the live chat option. Once the repair request is initiated it can take a day or two to receive a shipping label and repair details, and LG tells us it can take up to 7-10 business days for the actual repair once the display has been received at the service facility.

The 32GB iPhone 6 (2017) Slowly Makes Its Way to European Countries GO It was initially launched in Taiwan early this month Mar 15, 2017 20:02 GMT  ·  By Andrei Vlad  ·  Share:  We told you less than two weeks ago that Apple quietly launched a new version of its iPhone 6, which we believed was only for the Asian markets. Dubbed iPhone 6 (2017), the phone comes with 32GB storage and it's available in Gold color at major carrier Taiwan Mobile. Well, it looks like this isn't an Asian affair at all, as Apple's iPhone recently appeared in Europe. A Belarusian blog reports the 32GB iPhone 6 (2017) will soon be available for purchase in the country, but in Space Gray rather than Gold. The cited source mentions the smartphone will only be available for purchase at the i-Store in Minsk for around $520 outright. It's quite intriguing that Apple has decided to sell the smartphone through one of its official stores since the Taiwanese model is only available via carriers. As the name suggests, the new iPhone 6 recently introduced by Apple is basically the same device launched almost three years ago. However, as some of you might already know, Apple released three iPhone 6 variants in 2014, based on the amount of storage: 16GB, 64GB and 128GB. iPhone 6 (2017) The new iPhone 6 (2017) comes to fill the gap and adds a 32GB model that some customers might be accustomed to. Still, it's rather odd for Apple to launch the same iPhone after three years, even if that's supposed to provide customers with new options. Although the Belarusian blog doesn't specify it, the 32GB iPhone 6 (2017) might be available in limited quantities, so once the stock is depleted, there won't be any others to buy. Apple's decision to limit the number of 32GB iPhone 6 (2017) units makes sense since the company is expected to announce new models in the coming months. So, if you're interested in a small iPhone with a decent amount of storage that's not too expensive, then by all means just go ahead and buy one if you live in Belarus.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (2 Images) #iPhone 6 (2017)#32GB iPhone 6#Apple iPhone#iPhone 6 32GB#iPhone 6 subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Photo Gallery (2 Images) 01 02 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Apple Faces Fine in Russia After Being Charged with Fixing iPhone Prices Apple Releases Beta 6 of iOS 10.3 & macOS Sierra 10.12.4 to Devs, Public Testers Apple Launches a Gold 32GB iPhone 6 Variant for Asian Markets Apple Investigating iPhone 7 Plus That Caught Fire After Store Diagnostics Tests Samsung Galaxy S8 Features Camera and Iris Scanner Improvements LibreOffice 5.3 Office Suite Gets First Point Release with 100 Improvements Study: 96% of Websites Get Attacked by Bad Bots Windows 10 Creators Update Hides a Secret Ad Switch, Privacy Group Warns YouTube Discontinues Annoying Annotations LXLE 16.04.2 GNU/Linux Distro to Bring All the Goodies from Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS Netflix Turns to Thumbs Up/Down Ratings, Ditches 5-Stars System Intel Launches Bug Bounty Program, Offers Rewards of Up to $30,000 2 photos    iPhone 6 new ios apps NeuroNation: Train your brain to improve your memory and focus with NeuroNation Flipagram: Create cool videos by mixing up your photos with music Timer+: Set up dozens of timers and control them all with ease Nutshell Camera: Create some pretty cool videos with Nutshell Camera IKEA Catalogue: Check out the IKEA Catalogue for more than just furniture Complete: Complete puts a social twist to your regular to-do list/ task manager WebMD Baby: WebMD Baby offers help in how to best tend to your baby Reader comments New iPhone 8 Concept Imagines Siri with Augmented Reality Features more on: Apple i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

Wednesday, March 15, 2017 [Tweets] [Favorites] The Curious State of Apple Product Pricing Neil Cybart: Given the preceding list, a strong case could have been made for Apple to price its new wireless headphones at $249, or even $299. The fact that Samsung priced its Gear IconX at $199 seemed to suggest a sub-$200 retail price for AirPods was unlikely. Instead, Apple sent shockwaves pulsing through the market by pricing AirPods at only $159. The action instantly removed all available oxygen from the wireless headphone space. The idea of Apple coming out with a new product that would underprice nearly every other competitor was unimaginable ten years ago. […] At $269, Apple Watch Series 1 is one of lowest-priced smartwatches worth buying in the marketplace. Attractive pricing was one key factor driving record Apple Watch sales this past holiday quarter. In fact, even the Apple Watch Series 2, at $349, is one of the lowest-priced smartwatches in its class[…] However, it seems like most Mac models are not as competitively priced right now, Apple is focusing on the high end of the tablet market, and it sounds like iPhone prices will be expanding up rather than down.

Exactamundo. My suspicion on the specific case of Apple headphones is that they're taking a minimal margin here in order to smooth over complaints in ditching the headphone jack in order to not disturb their cash cow iPhone. Courage. This would have the implication that Apple may well increase margins to their "normal" level on their headphones over time, once the headphone jack transition recedes into the past. eliterrell March 15, 2017 4:28 PM Apple did something similar when they debuted the iPad at $500. They undercut a market that was just starting to take off around the $1000 level.

Further, it’d allow sense to come of the comments Tim Cook has made in the past about augmented reality. Not that they didn’t make sense on their own, but here in a concept iPhone X (X representing the unknown) without a visible bezel, Siri can shine, and the possibilities can create a whole new value proposition for the end consumer. The creator of this device concept is Gabor Balogh, and they come via Apple Insider. Further, the name iPhone 8 Edition has been floated by several sources over the past few months, and this week is coming to a head from at least one “anonymous source with information on the subject” to several disparate blogs. That doesn’t mean it’s any more or less verifiable than it was when it first appeared earlier this year. The concept, on the other hand, is absolutely fictional. If this device were really to be made, it’d cost an absolute fortune. It’d also probably be cheaper to replace entirely than to fix, if it were ever dropped. If it were ever dropped, it’d shatter instantly. As we learned recently with the Xiaomi Mi Mix, this isn’t always true of all “borderless” smartphones – but we’ll see! But assuming this iPhone 8 Edition – as we’re going to continue to call it – were viable, it’d be pretty neat. It’d finally give the world the augmented reality window into the future we’ve been waiting for. Similar to what we see with Google’s Tango phone and future, this is a product that’s worthy of some excitement. The software wouldn’t need to be extremely different from what we see today with a cross between Siri and Tango. Asking the phone for directions inside a building would put a dotted line on the floor. Asking what a landmark is by sight – that’s already built in to Google Goggles and Google Assistant. It’s the final product – the way it looks and functions – that’ll be magic. As it is, we’re expecting an iPhone 8 Edition – or maybe iPhone 7s Edition – to feature a display that’s large, but not quite this all-encompassing. On-screen controls are possible, but some hardware behind that Touch ID sensor will still be necessary in some capacity.

Manufacturing Partner Voices Proposal By Corazon Victorino On 03/15/17 AT 3:51 PM Close Apple’s manufacturing partner Pegatron has already voiced its desire of building the next-generation iPhones — iPhone 8, 7s and 7s Plus — in the U.S. as part of President Trump’s Made in America proposal. However, the company is only willing to do it if the Cupertino giant is paying all the expenses.  On Tuesday, Pegatron CEO Liao Syh-jang revealed that the Taiwanese electronics manufacturing company is open to building this year’s iPhones in the U.S. "As long as there is demand, whether the clients are American or Chinese, Pegatron already has its production lines in place," Liao told Focus Taiwan News Channel. If Trump institutes his Made in America proposal, it will be fine for Pegatron as long the client is willing to absorb the costs." While Pegatron’s main factories are found in Taiwan, China, Mexico and the Czech Republic, it also has facilities in California and Indiana. Hence, it wouldn’t be a problem for Apple’s main contract manufacturer of iPhones and iPads if it were to move its Apple-related operations in the U.S. As of late, the company’s U.S. facilities only function with HP and Dell’s product orders.  Liao expressed his proposal at an investor’s conference after being asked about his thoughts on Trump’s comments on the need of American companies to build their products within the country. It can be noted that following Trump’s win, there have been numerous speculations on whether or not Apple would move its production in its homeland, as per MacRumors.  Initially, Pegatron did not consider accommodating production shifts due to the expenses that would be involved. As for Apple’s other manufacturing partner Foxconn, it did come up with a plan in light of Trump’s campaign of imposing a 35 percent tariff to products manufactured overseas. However, Foxconn chairman Terry Gou said last week that the company’s main concern here is if the U.S. government is willing to pass regulations and laws that would enable it to create iPhone plants in the country. Furthermore, Gou believes the U.S. lacks skilled workforce for its plants.  Apple CEO Tim Cook addressed Trump’s push for Apple U.S. jobs long before Trump took office. "To make iPhones, there will need to be a cluster of suppliers in the same place, which the U.S. does not have at the moment," Cook said, according Apple Insider. "Even if Trump imposes a 45 percent tariff, it is still possible that manufacturers will decide to continue production overseas as long as the costs together with the tariffs are lower than the amount they need to spend on building and running production lines in the U.S." Pegatron has said that it is willing to build the next-generation iPhones in the U.S. provided Apple is willing to cover the cost.

Apple hasn’t confirmed an iOS 10.3 release date for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch but we know that it’s getting closer. Apple’s pushed rapid fire iOS 10.3 beta updates, a sign the upgrade is making substantial progress behind the scenes. The release of iOS 10.3 beta 6 comes less than a week after the company released an iOS 10.3 beta 5 for developers and those in the free Beta Software Program. The company is also rumored to have new hardware up its sleeve and supply sources claim the company could make an announcement as soon as next week. As we’ve noted, the iOS 10.3 release could have a tie-in with Apple’s new products. We don’t have an official iOS 10.3 release date to share but we do have some tips that could help you on the road to its release. iOS 10.3 Release Time The iOS 10.3 update is shaping up to be an exciting release. Its packed with new features, performance enhancements, and tweaks. And while you might be tempted to check your phone every 15 minutes for the update, that’s now how Apple iOS releases work. It’s difficult to predict the exact iOS 10.3 release date but it’s very easy to predict the iOS 10.3 release time. Here are a few things to keep in mind as we close in on the iOS 10.3 release date: Apple never releases iOS updates on the weekend so there’s no need to check for iOS 10.3 on Saturday or Sunday. iOS updates almost always arrive between 9AM and 10AM Pacific. General rule of thumb is to check around 10AM Pacific. While some of you will want to download the iOS 10.3 update the second it arrives, many others will want to wait. Skip the iOS 10.3 Beta We’re now on iOS 10.3 beta 7 which means we’re probably really close to the official release. With a release imminent, most people should avoid the iOS 10.3 beta and wait for the official release. The potential headaches aren’t worth it at this point. Prepare Your iPhone, iPad or iPod With an iOS 10.3 release date likely days away, now is the perfect time to start preparing for the update’s release. Here are a few pre-installation tips to keep in your back pocket as we approach the arrival of iOS 10.3: Use this time to cleanup your device. Get rid of files (apps, music, etc), anything you no longer use. Cleaning up your device could improve your device’s performance. Start backing up your data. If you don’t know where to start, you’ll want to research iCloud backups, iTunes backups, and the differences between the two. This is especially important due to the arrival of AFPS. If you want to download iOS 10.3 right when it comes out, make sure your device has at least a 50% charge (or you’re near a charger) around 10AM Pacific. Get your login information handy. Make sure you have the device’s passcode, Apple ID, and your important logins ready on release day. The update might log you out of various apps and services. Dig into feedback from iOS 10.3 beta testers. You might learn about a potential problem or benefit to your version of iOS 10.3. A little prep work will help you avoid major problems during the iOS 10.3 installation process. It’ll also help you avoid headaches once you get the new update on board your phone or tablet. Learn About iOS 10.3 Make sure you know what you’re getting into before you download the iOS 10.3 update on your phone. This goes deeper than just perusing the change log Apple will include with the update. You’ll want to dig deeper, especially if you own an older device. iOS 10.3 isn’t officially out for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch but thanks to the iOS 10.3 beta for developers and the general public, we know what to expect. A new iCloud storage breakdown in iOS 10.3 shows you exactly how your using your space. We’ve put together a broad guide to the iOS 10.3 update. We’ve also put together some in-depth analysis of the iOS 10.3 update’s most exciting features. If you haven’t been following the iOS 10.3 beta, now would be a good time to dig in. We don’t expect the update to change much between now and the official release date and we don’t expect the beta to be too much different from the official version of iOS 10.3. Report iOS 10.3 Problems If you choose to install iOS 10.3 on release day there’s a chance you’ll run into an issue during or after the installation process finishes up. If you do run into an iOS 10.3 problem on your phone, there’s no need to panic. Sometimes it can take a couple of days for an update to settle in. If you notice weird battery life on release day, give it a day or two to even out. If problems persist after two days with iOS 10.3, or if the issues are serious, you’ll want to take action. There are tons of resources out there but our list of fixes for common iOS 10 problems is a great place to start. If you don’t consider yourself an expert, you’ll want to bookmark those fixes so you’re ready to tackle problems as soon as they popup. If you can’t fix your problem and/or you want to help the community, you’ll want to report iOS 10.3 problems as you see them. There are a few places to do that. You can relay your problem to Apple Support on Twitter and/or get in contact with Apple Support via the company’s website. We also recommend reporting your problem on Apple’s Discussion forums to alert Apple and other users to your issue. You Can Test iOS 10.3 Remember, if you don’t want to deal with the iOS 10.3 beta, you can take the official version of iOS 10.3 for a test drive provided you’re already on iOS 10.2.1. For a short time, Apple will allow you to drop back down to iOS 10.2.1. You won’t be able to downgrade to anything older than iOS 10.2.1 and it will only be open for a short period of time, probably a couple of weeks tops. Most of you will choose to remain on iOS 10.3 but others might benefit from dropping down to the older version of iOS 10. If you aren’t familiar with the iOS downgrade process, now is the time. Get Off Beta If you’re currently trying the iOS 10.3 beta and you don’t want to get thrown onto the next iOS 10 beta (iOS 10.3.1? iOS 10.4?), you’ll want to unenroll from the iOS 10.3 beta. Here’s how to do that. Go to Settings > General > Profiles and then tap the iOS Beta Software Profile that appears on your device. Enter your passcode, if there is on associated with the device, and tap Delete Profile. You will no longer receive beta software. Go into your Settings or iTunes and download iOS 10.3. If you’ve been running an iOS 10.3 and the watchOS beta on your Apple Watch, you’ll need to take a few more steps before, on, or after the iOS 10.3 release date. Here’s how to get the watchOS beta off your device, Open the Apple Watch app on your iPhone. Tap the My Watch tab. Go to General > Profiles. Tap the beta profile you want to remove. Enter a passcode if needed and then tap Delete Profile. If you want to use beta software again you’ll need to install the correct beta profile. iOS 10.3 Update: 7 Reasons to Get Excited & 3 Reasons Not To iOS 10.3 Release Date: March or Early April   1 / 10 The first thing to get excited about is that you probably won't have to wait too much longer for the official version of iOS 10.3 to arrive for your device.  If you're uninterested in trying out the iOS 10.3 beta, or if you're dealing with an maddening problem on iOS 10.2.1 or an older version of iOS, know that the iOS 10.3 release date should take place in the near future. We haven't been able to nail down an exact date but a March or April iOS 10.3 release is trending in the right direction. April is probably the worst case scenario at this point.  Nothing is confirmed but Apple is rumored to have a launch event planned for March. The company is reportedly planning to debut new iPad models including new versions of the iPad Pro.  Apple hasn't confirmed a date but supply chain sources claim the company is looking to announce new products sometime next week. Another report points to a launch in early April alongside the debut of the company's new campus.  So how does iOS 10.3 play into this? Well, a Bloomberg says "Apple may roll out the new iPad software features as part of an upgrade to the iOS 10 operating system in the first half of 2017."  It's also worth noting that last year's March event saw the debut of a new iPad Pro, the iPhone SE, and Apple's official version of iOS 9.3. The company released the iOS 9.3 update the same day as the event.  With the iOS 10.3 beta now on its seventh iteration (!), a lack of changes on recent beta releases (it's probably not going to add new features to the beta, it's a refinement process at this point), and a potential event looming, we're confident iOS 10.3 will be released sooner rather than later. And that's pretty exciting.    1 / 10 Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published. Comment Name* Email* Website

Anytime. Anywhere. Build Apps 5x Faster For Half the Cost Enterprise Cloud Computing On Force.com What the CIA WikiLeaks Dump Tells Us: Encryption Works By Anick Jesdanun and Michael Liedtke PUBLISHED: MARCH 15 2017 If the tech industry is drawing one lesson from the latest WikiLeaks disclosures, it's that data-scrambling encryption works, and the industry should use more of it. Documents purportedly outlining a massive CIA surveillance program suggest that CIA agents must go to great lengths to circumvent encryption they can't break. In many cases, physical presence is required to carry off these targeted attacks. "We are in a world where if the U.S. government wants to get your data, they can't hope to break the encryption," said Nicholas Weaver, who teaches networking and security at the University of California, Berkeley. "They have to resort to targeted attacks, and that is costly, risky and the kind of thing you do only on targets you care about. Seeing the CIA have to do stuff like this should reassure civil libertarians that the situation is better now than it was four years ago." More Encryption Four years ago is when former NSA contractor Edward Snowden revealed details of huge and secret U.S. eavesdropping programs. To help thwart spies and snoops, the tech industry began to protectively encrypt email and messaging apps, a process that turns their contents into indecipherable gibberish without the coded "keys" that can unscramble them. The NSA revelations shattered earlier assumptions that internet data was nearly impossible to intercept for meaningful surveillance, said Joseph Lorenzo Hall, chief technologist at the Washington-based civil-liberties group Center for Democracy & Technology. That was because any given internet message gets split into a multitude of tiny "packets," each of which traces its own unpredictable route across the network to its destination. The realization that spy agencies had figured out that problem spurred efforts to better shield data as it transits the internet. A few services such as Facebook's WhatsApp followed the earlier example of Apple's iMessage and took the extra step of encrypting data in ways even the companies couldn't unscramble, a method called end-to-end encryption. Challenges for Authorities In the past, spy agencies like the CIA could have hacked servers at WhatsApp or similar services to see what people were saying. End-to-end encryption, though, makes that prohibitively difficult. So the CIA has to resort to tapping individual phones and intercepting data before it is encrypted or after it's decoded. It's much like the old days when "they would have broken into a house to plant a microphone," said Steven Bellovin, a Columbia University professor who has long studied cybersecurity issues. Cindy Cohn, executive director for Electronic Frontier Foundation, a group focused on online privacy, likened the CIA's approach to "fishing with a line and pole rather than fishing with a driftnet." Encryption has grown so strong that even the FBI had to seek Apple's help last year in cracking the locked iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino attackers. Apple resisted what it considered an intrusive request, and the FBI ultimately broke into the phone by turning to an unidentified party for a hacking tool --" presumably one similar to those the CIA allegedly had at its disposal. On Wednesday, FBI Director James Comey acknowledged the challenges posed by encryption. He said there should be a balance between privacy and the FBI's ability to lawfully access information. He also said the FBI needs to recruit talented computer personnel who might otherwise go to work for Apple or Google. Government officials have long wanted to force tech companies to build "back doors" into encrypted devices, so that the companies can help law enforcement descramble messages with a warrant. But security experts warn that doing so would undermine security and privacy for everyone. As Apple CEO Tim Cook pointed out last year, a back door for good guys can also be a back door for bad guys. So far, efforts to pass such a mandate have stalled. Still a Patchwork At the moment, though, end-to-end encrypted services such as iMessage and WhatsApp are still the exception. While encryption is far more widely used than it was in 2013, many messaging companies encode user data in ways that let them read or scan it. Authorities can force these companies to divulge message contents with warrants or other legal orders. With end-to-end encryption, the companies wouldn't even have the keys to do so. Further expanding the use of end-to-end encryption presents some challenges. That's partly because encryption will make it more difficult to perform popular tasks such as searching years of emails for mentions of a specific keyword. Google announced in mid-2014 that it was working on end-to-end encryption for email, but the tools have yet to materialize beyond research environments. Instead, Google's Gmail encrypts messages in transit. But even that isn't possible unless it's adopted by the recipient's mail system as well. And encryption isn't a panacea, as the WikiLeaks disclosures suggest. According to the purported CIA documents, spies have found ways to exploit holes in phone and computer software to grab messages when they haven't been encrypted yet. Although Apple, Google and Microsoft say they have fixed many of the vulnerabilities alluded to in the CIA documents, it's not known how many holes remain open. "There are different levels where attacks take place, said Daniel Castro, vice president with the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. "We may have secured one level (with encryption), but there are other weaknesses out there we should be focused on as well." Cohn said people should still use encryption, even with these bypass techniques. "It's better than nothing," she said. "The answer to the fact that your front door might be cracked open isn't to open all your windows and walk around naked, too." © 2017 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

Cybercrime Network Raids in Europe Next Article > Arm Your Business Against Social Media 'Brandjacking' By Ann Marie van den Hurk PUBLISHED: MARCH 15 2017 The use of social media can give small businesses a big boost. But social channels can also be minefields of trouble. Potential headaches include fraudsters falsely assuming your or your business's identity -- what's called "brandjacking" -- with the intent of ruining your reputation or scramming consumers. Brandjacking, unfortunately, is pretty easy to pull off, requiring only a Twitter, Facebook or Instagram account and a desire to inflict damage on a targeted organization. And the issue is getting worse. The number of fake social media profiles created for fraudulent purposes increased 1,100 percent from 2014 to 2016, according to new research by social media security firm ZeroFOX. Meanwhile, research from ProofPoint, a cybersecurity company, suggests social media phishing attacks have become disturbingly common. More specifically, the firm has seen a rise in what are called "angler phishing” attacks, in which a fake customer support account is set up to lure consumers into giving out their personal information. Other scams include verification phishing, in which troublemakers impersonate actual social networks by offering users allegedly verified accounts and then asking those users to provide personal information as part of the bogus verification process. There's also ad phishing, in which the fraudsters set up fake corporate accounts on their made-up social networks, making them look more legitimate and proliferating their scam. These traps are well developed, and the con artists, to make things seem more realistic, will participate in online discussions and back-and-forth tweets before directing users to other, less-public channels like email and direct messaging. You should also look out for malicious URLs embedded in social media posts, which can direct users to malware or credential-harvesting sites. And while the big social networks all have established policies and protections in place to combat fraud, given their millions of users, the platforms can't be fully policed. All of this creates a tricky environment for brands. But there are at least two good ways to prevent your brand from being hijacked and used for ill gains: Officially register your business on every social media platform, including new ones, even if you aren't planning to be active on them. Use monitoring tools to not just keep track of customer service needs, but also dodgy activity. Awareness can help you battle these scammers and keep them from damaging your business and the trust of your customers. © 2017 Valley News under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

They may have met with some ridicule when Apple revealed them, but the ongoing stock shortages would suggest that the mass market doesn’t care: they want their AirPods, and they’re willing to pay $159 for them. Having lived with them as my primary headphones for some time now, I can’t say I disagree. I praised Apple’s connectivity process with the AirPods when I first set them up, and the way Bluetooth is handled continues to be one of the best features of the earphones. The initial pairing is as simple as opening the AirPods case while near your iPhone, tapping the button on the pane that pops up automatically on the screen, and then allowing that association to propagate through just about all of the devices signed into the same Apple ID. Since then, it’s been rock stable. That’s more than I can say for other Bluetooth headsets and headphones, which can all too often lose their pairing or refuse to connect until you power-cycle Bluetooth on one or both devices. AirPods automatically reconnect to whatever they were used with last – in my case, that means either my MacBook Pro or my iPhone 7 Plus – though switching between them is simple enough from the Control Center on iOS or the Bluetooth icon in the macOS menu bar. Better still would be having both paired simultaneously, as headsets from some other manufacturers support, and something I hope Apple embraces too. Battery life continues to fit well with my use. I generally wear AirPods while traveling and for calls or sometimes listening to music while at home. That doesn’t include marathon four-hour-plus sessions, admittedly, so I’ve not pushed up against the limits of the AirPods’ own batteries. Instead, they’re usually just at 100-percent whenever I take them out of their case, with the whole thing getting a top-up a couple of times a week when I remember to plug the charger in. Siri continues to be the least-used part of the AirPods experience for me. Partly it’s being self-conscious about talking to myself; at the same time, Siri’s integration with third-party apps like Spotify still falls well short of native services like Apple Music. If I need to change volume or skip tracks I generally do it on the connected device. I haven’t really felt the need to ask Apple’s assistant for help in other ways. One thing I’ve changed my mind on is fit. My primary concern when the AirPods were announced was that, like my experience with Apple’s wired EarPods, they simply wouldn’t stay in my ears. After an aborted attempt to balance the EarPods, even precariously, I’ve since left them unopened in each successive iPhone box. Maybe it’s the lack of cables pulling down on the AirPods. Maybe it’s their lighter weight, or the way that the odd little stem acts as a counterbalance as it trails down your jawline. Whatever the reason, my fears that little more than a turn of my head would send an earbud flying proved to be unfounded. Sometimes it doesn’t feel that way, and I find myself pressing or twisting an AirPod self-consciously to make sure it really is lodged securely in place. Invariably, though, when I do that I discover that it really was stable in the first place, and I was simply being paranoid. The only time one has actually popped out was when I caught it with my hoodie. Molded rubber tips would probably reduce that paranoia, but then the AirPods probably wouldn’t fit into their case. While I’m generally very happy, it’s not to say I don’t see room for improvement. The option to have Bluetooth stay enabled even when you switch on Airplane Mode would be useful: as it is, turning it on will disconnect your AirPods at the same time, forcing you to manually re-enable it. Sure, it’s only an extra tap, but it’s a jolt in your listening experience all the same and it reminds you of one advantage wired headphones have over their cable-free replacements. Color is another place Apple could easily shake things up. The glossy white finish is definitely eye-catching – and is a nod to the original EarPods, of course – but sometimes that attention can be unwanted (many people, it turns out, are very comfortable voicing their opinion about your Bluetooth headphones of choice, especially if those opinions are negative and they think “it looks like you left a Q-tip in your ear”). A set of black AirPods, preferably matte black to match the black iPhone 7, would be an obvious and welcome route for Apple to take. I wouldn’t argue with a clip on the case, either, since it’s quite easy to lose it to the depths of your bag. Something I’m not sure Apple needs to address is audio quality. True, the AirPods aren’t going to deliver the very greatest of sound: for a start they lack exterior noise isolation, and even if they did you couldn’t really compare sub-$200 headphones with some of the more audiophile-friendly options out here. All the same, I continue to be impressed by how much sound they put out, given their size: they get loud enough to drown out an airline safety demonstration, for instance, without becoming overly boomy or piercing in the high-end. Of course, much of the AirPods’ magic is in the Apple W1 chip that was specially developed to streamline the Bluetooth. Apple could easily transplant that into more high-end headphones or earbuds if it thought there was a market for them. The core features, like the impressively long wireless range – something I’ve noticed when walking away from my iPhone while on a call and suddenly realizing I’m a room away and there’s been no degradation of the audio – would be carried over. NOW READ: Apple AirPods Review Are the AirPods worth $159? If you’re an iPhone user, I’d still say the answer is yes. The world isn’t short on Bluetooth headsets, but none integrate so smoothly and seamlessly with iOS as Apple’s own product. When it comes to something you want to “just work” when you need it, that’s especially important. The last thing I need is to be troubleshooting wireless connections when I want to answer a call or listen to Spotify. Those with an Android device will still probably want to look elsewhere, but for now, three months on, I’m having no AirPods regrets.

Apple Could Launch an Iterative 9.7-Inch iPad Pro Successor with Minor Upgrades GO The new tablet is expected to pack an A10X chip inside Mar 15, 2017 19:14 GMT  ·  By Andrei Vlad  ·  Share:  Apple is expected to launch new iPads in the coming weeks, but while rumors swirl around the new lineup that the company could unveil, a launch even hasn't been confirmed yet. Based on the previous rumors, Apple could launch as many as four new iPads at an event that is likely to be held in April: a new 10.5-inch flagship iPad Pro, a successor to the current 9.7-inch iPad Pro model, a refreshed 12.9-inch model, as well as an affordable 7.9-inch iPad mini. We now have more info on one of the iPads that are rumored to be unveiled in April, specifically the 9.7-inch iPad Pro 2. According to Japanese blog Macotakara, Apple will launch an iterative version of the current 9.7-inch iPad Pro model. An iterative version means that there won't be much changes when it comes to hardware or design, which in turn will reduce production costs. The fact that the new 9.7-inch iPad Pro 2 won't cost too much to produce might also lead to a lower retail price, but we wouldn't bet on that since we're talking about Apple here. The new iPad tablet could be announced as early as next week An affordable 9.7-inch iPad Pro is quite possible and has been rumored for quite some time, as Apple analyst KGI predicted the Cupertino company might launch such a product this year. Macotakara claims the only major improvement of the 9.7-inch iPad Pro 2 over the predecessor will be the addition of an A10X chip to offer better COU and graphics performance. The design will remain the same, which means current accessories that have been specially developed for the 9.7-inch iPad Pro (Smart Keyboard, Apple Pencil) could work on the upcoming iterative iPad model as well. One other interesting aspect mentioned by the Japanese blog is the fact that Apple could launch this rather affordable 9.7-inch iPad Pro sometime next week, not at a dedicated event in April. Well, we're going to find out if it's true or not in just one week. #9.7-inch iPad Pro#iPad Pro 2#new iPad#Apple iPad#iPad Pro subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Apple Said to Unveil 10.5-Inch iPad Pro at Early April Event New iPads Could Be Unveiled on April 4 at Apple Park Apple Launches a Gold 32GB iPhone 6 Variant for Asian Markets Apple Might Announce New iPhone SE with 128GB This Month Samsung Galaxy S8 Features Camera and Iris Scanner Improvements LibreOffice 5.3 Office Suite Gets First Point Release with 100 Improvements Study: 96% of Websites Get Attacked by Bad Bots Windows 10 Creators Update Hides a Secret Ad Switch, Privacy Group Warns YouTube Discontinues Annoying Annotations LXLE 16.04.2 GNU/Linux Distro to Bring All the Goodies from Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS Netflix Turns to Thumbs Up/Down Ratings, Ditches 5-Stars System Intel Launches Bug Bounty Program, Offers Rewards of Up to $30,000    9.7-inch iPad Pro New ios.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: PhoneBuff Guess which iPhone feature Samsung seemingly plans to steal next Chris Smith @chris_writes March 15th, 2017 at 1:10 PM Share Tweet Often accused to copy the iPhone with its high-end Galaxy phones, Samsung is in a unique position when it comes to anticipating its biggest rival’s next moves. Samsung is also a supplier of critical iPhone components, which means it knows ahead of time what Apple is working on. A new report from Korea indicates that Samsung is already working on a major component for the iPhone 8, and it’s one that might be seen in the upcoming Galaxy S8 and Galaxy Note 8 as well. Don't Miss: The Galaxy S8 and Note 8 might not even be the best phones Samsung unveils this year According to South Korea’s The Investor, Samsung Display has been developing a pressure-sensitive OLED touch display for the iPhone 8. In other words, Samsung Display is making a new kind of 3D Touch screen for the next-generation iPhone, based on OLED technology, that will incorporate the 3D Touch functionality introduced on Apple’s earlier LCD displays. Samsung Display reportedly demoed the screen behind closed doors at Mobile World Congress a few weeks ago, as it prepares to ramp up efforts to incorporate the 3D Touch sensor into its own screens. “The latest technology boasts higher sensitivity and a wider range of pressure-sensing levels compared to the previous one used in Huawei’s P9 in 2015,” a source told the site. However, it’s unclear whether the new component is ready for mass consumption. The report notes the Galaxy S8 will incorporate 3D Touch functionality only for the virtual home button on the phone. The handset is expected to lack a physical home button, just like the iPhone 8. For Apple, the 3D Touch functionality it launched with the iPhone 6s can be seen as a precursor to the button-less iPhone 8 it’ll unveil later this year. 3D Touch provides pressure sensitivity and tactile feedback similar to pressing a button and can be used to replace most of the features that are traditionally associated with the iconic home button found on iOS devices. That way, Apple can afford to remove a physical button without losing any of its features, some of which are critical for iOS operations. Apple will need 3D Touch to be available anywhere on the screen in the iPhone 8, as is the case with its predecessors. Samsung, meanwhile, will apparently add 3D Touch support to the entire screen on the Galaxy Note 8, a phone expected to arrive late this summer or in the early fall. In addition to developing the hardware, Samsung will also have to come up with software ideas for implementing 3D Touch-like functionality on its Android phones.

We’re liking some of the smart ideas presented in his batch of thoughtfully done renderings that envision a much more useful Lock screen on iOS 11. Going beyond simple things like checking the date and time, launching the camera, accessing your favorite widgets and seeing notifications that have arrived since your last unlock, Birchler is proposing a Lock screen with Apple Watch-like complications, user-selectable app shortcuts, alert bundles, smart notifications that could be augmented further with optional location information and so forth. “All changes are based on things I think Apple can actually accomplish this year,” wrote Birchler. “This is not one of those mockups that suggest Apple should just throw everything out and start over.” Notifications get a huge upgrade Notifications for incoming texts have always appeared on iPhone’s Lock screen. As Apple brought us Notification Center in subsequent iOS releases, alerts from other apps could appear on the Lock screen as well. With iOS 10, Apple has implemented rich notifications that can be interacted with easily on devices that support 3D Touch. Birchler’s idea for Lock screen notifications on iOS 11 would bundle each app’s notifications together rather than render them on the Lock screen in chronological order. That could be a great feature, especially knowing iOS 10 has inexplicably removed the option from Settings for optionally grouping notifications by apps. “This solves the issue with Android’s implementation of this feature where bundled notification can’t be unbundled and managed one at a time,” he said. A gear icon shown upon swiping an alert would let you configure alerts for that particular app. Moreover, a location marker could appear next to alerts for folks you’ve added through Find My Friends, letting you see see where they are messaging you from. To protect your security, embedded location information would only appear after you have authenticated yourself on the Lock screen by resting a finger on Touch ID. Other improvements could include persistent notifications that stay on the Lock screen until they’re cleared and smart notifications triggered by your location, time and activity. In the example above, Fantastical presents an alert on the Lock screen because it knows the user has an appointment at 11am. “Theoretically this could also have access to Apple Maps’ transit information and would calculate travel times based on my current location and change its display when it knew I needed to leave,” according to Birchler. And lastly, more powerful notification markers on apps like Snapchat and Tweetbot would go beyond telling you how many alerts you have. In the case of Tweetbot, for example, the app could break down your alerts better than before. Pressing a notification bundle for other apps might reveal such things as your latest tweets, the remaining time in the current episode, the time of your next event and more. Apple Watch-like complications on iPhone and iPad Birchler posits that Apple should bring complications from watchOS over to iOS 11’s Lock screen. On watchOS, as I’m sure you know, complications are tiny visual elements from your favorite apps that can be added on a watch face that supports them in order to communicate important information as soon as you raise your wrist. iOS complications could bring similar functionality to your Lock screen, like weather previews along with the current temperature and conditions. Not even Android has implemented complications on smartphones so bringing those glanceable pieces of information to the iOS Lock screen would definitely make sense. Your favorite apps on Lock screen Your Lock screen offers access to Handoff and Siri-suggested apps (via the widgets screen, revealed via swiping). Birchler envisions a scenario in which icons for user-selectable apps like Spotify, Snapchat and Tweetbot would appear on the Lock screen. “This would be made even better with iPhone 8 able to authenticate with your face and would not require you to use Touch ID before letting you launch the app,” he said. And if Apple embeds a next-generation Touch ID into the screen, you would authenticate just by tapping on these app icons. Do you like his concept? If so, you’re wholeheartedly recommended to check out a set of renderings imagining iPhone 8’s rumored function area. Another batch of mockups envisions iOS 11’s rumored Dark Mode on iPhone 8‘s allegedly bezel-less design. And be sure to check out an augmented reality Siri concept, seen below. Apple will shows us what we’re getting in iOS 11, macOS 10.13, watchOS 3 and tvOS 11 at its annual developers conference, which kicks off with a keynote on June 5.

Sarah Tew/CNET Phones by Gordon Gottsegen March 14, 2017 4:13 PM PDT @ggottsegen The rumored iPhone 8 may not feature that curved edge-to-edge OLED display that we've heard so much about after all (reported on here, here and here), according to some industry analysts. IHS Markit analyst Wayne Lam says that Apple will stick to its flat-screen design, but still with an OLED screen versus the LCD technology found in today's iPhones, according to the firm's research on suppliers. Lam anticipates the screen to feature a more gentle 2.5D curve (like the one found in the iPhone 7 and iPhone 6S) instead of a Samsung Edge-style display. Bringing 3D touch to the iPhone 8 could make an expensive phone even more expensive. Andrew Hoyle/CNET This speculation falls in line with reports from TrendForce and claims from KGI securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. Kuo previously stated that Apple will stick to the gentle 2.5D curve because a full-on curved display would be harder to make on a large scale and make the iPhone less drop-proof. Apple is rumored to be loading the 10th anniversary iPhone with a ton of premium features like OLED screens, a high screen-to-body ratio, and AR capabilities. All these add-ons may result in an iPhone that costs well over $1,000. While OLED displays may be a driving force in the price increase -- Apple reportedly spent billions of dollars securing them from Samsung -- other iPhone parts could keep the price high regardless if the iPhone's screens are curved or not. For instance, making an OLED screen work with the iPhone's 3D touch pressure-sensitive technology could also hike up the price, Digitimes reports. While 3D touch sensors cost Apple $9 (about £7.40/AU$11.89) in current iPhones, the new OLED 3D touch sensors could cost $15 (about £12.33/AU$19.82) according to the report. While this may seem like a few bucks, it represents a 60 percent price increase for a single component. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The company’s contract manufacturers are located in China and the supply chain is heavily reliant on suppliers based across Asia. However, Pegatron, one of Apple’s manufacturing partners, has said that it’s possible to start production in the United States if Apple “absorbs the costs.” That’s just a more modest way of saying that Apple will have to pick up the bill. Pegatron CEO Liao Syh-jang was recently asked at an investor conference about the company’s plans regarding the expansion of manufacturing to the United States. He told the gathering that Pegatron is open to start manufacturing in the United States but also pointed out that the client would be the one that has to absorb all of the related costs. So if that client were to be Apple, it would have to pay for all of the costs associated with manufacturing the iPhone in its home country. That would obviously have an impact on the company’s margins and one of the ways to counter that is by raising prices so you can see why this is easier said than done. Apple hasn’t said anything about moving iPhone production to the United States and even though the calls to do so continue to gather steam, such a monumental move will certainly require a lot of thought on part of Apple and its suppliers before it becomes reality.

I’ve continued thinking about this possibility, however, and now a cellular option is at the top of my wish list for the Apple Watch Series 3. A cellular option could solve specific problems that the faster, GPS-equipped Apple Watch Series 2 hasn’t resolved. Sony A6500 At a high level, a cellular option for Apple Watch offers two things: greater independence from iPhone and less redundancy for features. Cellular connectivity is the main reason you need an iPhone to make Apple Watch stay connected away from Wi-Fi. Some tasks that are convenient on Apple Watch can be done on the iPhone that’s required to use it too; greater independence means less redundancy and more purpose. More specifically, cellular connectivity could greatly improve the audio playback experience on Apple Watch. Right now it takes a long time to sync music to Apple Watch for offline playback (not to mention the arbitrary restrictions that are in place). You can’t just buy a new Apple Watch, quickly sync a playlist, and go for a run with that music and no iPhone in under half an hour. Expect the process to take hours. You also can’t sync music from iPhone to Apple Watch without a (good) Wi-Fi connection. Play an album in the car from Apple Watch and want to pick up from Apple Watch during a run without iPhone? Not happening unless you already synced that album. Apple could develop a much faster transfer process (and should), but offering a cellular option could enable streaming any Apple Music from over the Internet to Apple Watch paired with AirPods or other Bluetooth audio. That solves syncing duration, the playlist restriction, and choosing what to sync by approaching the problem from a different direction. You can’t sync podcasts to Apple Watch yet either. I believe that’s because podcast feeds update so frequently, syncing playback position is a challenge, and syncing large audio files really does take a long time. A cellular option that supported podcast episode streaming addresses all of these challenges. Same situation with audiobooks, only the audio length can be dramatically longer. Syncing playback position and streaming over cellular to Apple Watch could work especially if you’re only streaming during workouts or brief trips away from your iPhone. Apple Watch Series 2 added an embedded GPS that enables offline location tracking for outdoor workouts like running, cycling, and swimming. I wasn’t sure I would use this feature since going on an outdoor workout with just Apple Watch means missing important phone calls and messages from iPhone. My default outdoor run no longer involves the iPhone, however, since running with just the Apple Watch is less of a hassle. I haven’t missed any emergency alerts yet, but the thought still concerns me when I’m offline. This limitation is surely a deal breaker for other people. I wouldn’t want every phone call and text message to interrupt me during an outdoor workout, but Apple’s Do Not Disturb rules of only letting favorited contacts and repeated contact attempts pass through would work fine. People already think you can make phone calls and send and receive messages from Apple Watch from anywhere without iPhone. Blame Dick Tracy. If it were actually possible, safety would increase and I wouldn’t find myself explaining the iPhone requirement limitation when people ask about Apple Watch. If Apple does introduce a cellular option with Apple Watch Series 3 this year, how would they charge for the hardware and how would you pay for the data? My guess is we would see models with cellular and models without cellular just like we see with iPads today. Not everyone will want the cellular option and including the extra hardware will be more expensive. Apple already segments the Apple Watch lineup by price with Series 1 and Series 2 with the primary difference being the GPS. A 42mm Apple Watch Series 2 currently starts at $399; Apple could maintain that price point with an aluminum Apple Watch Series 3 but offer a cellular option at $529. That’s still cheaper than the base stainless steel version at $599 which could include cellular for $729. Payment could also work like iPads today. For example, I can pay my carrier $10/month as an access fee to connect a cellular iPad to my account and use my 15GB data pool. There are also a lot of “unlimited” data plans popping up now which could be a factor. In terms of data consumption, my personal usage could work with my existing data pool. I would usually have my iPhone with me, but during the 30 to 60 minute outdoor workouts with Apple Watch, the data would be useful. Relying on iPhone for the majority of the day and Apple Watch with a small but important fraction of the day would also help with battery life. If you used Apple Watch on its own all day long for cellular data consumption, you would certainly use more data from your pool and knock out your battery much faster. But relying on the cellular connection for an hour a day could probably work within today’s battery life constraints before factoring in more efficient processors coming in the future. Apple Watch gaining cellular has been rumored before but obviously hasn’t shipped yet. Now that I’ve seen the benefits of a faster, GPS-equipped Apple Watch Series 2 over the last several months, cellular coming to Apple Watch Series 3 is on the very top of my wish list.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Business Guy Kawasaki on the most important thing he learned working with Steve Jobs Yoni Heisler @edibleapple March 12th, 2017 at 9:00 AM Share Tweet Even though Guy Kawasaki has held many hats throughout his illustrious career, his name has been synonymous with Apple for as long as most people can remember. Kawasaki’s first stint at Apple dates back to 1983 where he served as the company’s Mac evangelist, essentially touting the benefits of the Mac platform to developers and the public at large. Don't Miss: Leak: Can the iPhone 8 compete with a Galaxy S8 that looks like this? Earlier this year, Kawasaki penned an interesting post on Quora where he detailed what he learned from his time working with Steve Jobs. What makes Kawasaki’s perspective so fascinating is that his experience working with Jobs occurred during the mid-1980s, long before Jobs managed to tone down his legendary temper. Based on his time at Apple, Kawasaki relays that being 100% honest at all times was the most valuable thing he learned from working with Jobs. Indeed, we’ve seen a number anecdotes from former and current Apple employees over the past few years articulating the same, namely that Jobs didn’t necessarily demand that everyone agree with him at all times, but rather that he respected complete honesty, no matter how brutal. On the flipside, Jobs himself was never one to shy away from hurting anyone’s feelings in the interest of delivering cold hard truths. Laying out the benefits of steadfast honesty, Kawasaki writes: Telling the truth is a test of your character and intelligence. You need strength to tell the truth, and intelligence to recognize what is true. People yearn for the truth—that is, telling people that their product is good just to be positive doesn’t help them improve it. There’s only one truth,so it’s easier to be consistent if you’re honest. If you are dishonest, you have to keep track of what you have said. All in all, some wise guidelines for life, both in and out of the workplace.

However, the iPhone 8 (or iPhone X) screen is rumored to be better visually but have less functionality, according to report by Nikkei. The OLED screen with curved edges for the iPhone 8 will be solely provided by Samsung. The curve will be “gentler” than screens in Galaxy S7s “due to the challenges of making curved glass covers to match screens,” Nikkei reported. Read: iPhone Rumors: Apple's iPhone 8 and Future iPhones Will Feature OLED Panel iPhone By 2019 “While the curved screen will allow a viewable area of about 5.2 inches and make the iPhone even sleeker, it will not offer significant new functions, the person said,” the report added. OLED screens are better than current LCD screens, since they have a sharper color contrast. Other companies have implemented OLED screens on their devices, which means Apple is late to the party.  However, the company is not expected to offer any groundbreaking functions with the curved screens. Other rumors suggest the company will stick with a flat display, but that won’t take full advantage of OLED displays, a source told Nikkei. The design of the device has not been finalized, which means Apple could change its course, the source added.

China's Biel Crystal and Lens Technology will supply glass backs for the device and Foxconn Technology Group will provide the front glass covers, according to Wednesday’s report. Apple iPhone 8 Rumors, Price Last month, KGI securities analyst Ming Chi-Kuo suggested the 10th anniversary iPhone could feature a 3D-sensing front camera that may support depth sensing for games and facial recognition. The iPhone 8 is also rumored to come without a physical home button. Since the iPhone 8 is expected to come with an OLED screen, the device is rumored to be priced at more than $1,000. The iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus are expected to come with LCD panels.

DevOps' barriers Company culture and challenges of testing automation are the two top barriers to DevOps success, according to the latest research from sandbox vendor Quali.  The survey, entitled Top 10 Barriers to DevOps, finds that 14 percent of respondents cited company culture as the key issue, while 13 percent said challenges of testing automation.  Following this was 12 percent citing legacy systems, 11 percent saying application complexity and 11 percent noting budget constraints were their main barrier to DevOps success. Also of note, 54 percent of respondents said they had no access to self-service infrastructure, meaning they take a ticket-based approach to infrastructure delivery.  The survey, which was carried out online and at tech industry events, including Cisco Live, VMWorld, DevOps Summit, AWS re:Invent, Delivery of Things and Jenkins World, over the course of 2016 and garnered responses from 2045 respondents across the U.S., also considered tools used for DevOps, timings, number of applications run in hybrid cloud environments and applications. Apple's Russian prices Apple has been found guilty of price fixing in Russia. In a statement, originally in Russian, the Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) said that since the iPhone 5s, iPhone 5c, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus and iPhone 6s Plus had gone on sale in Russia, they had been subject to coordinated prices by certain resellers, under the instruction of an Apple subsidiary in Russia. According to the Financial Times (FT), Apple instructed 16 retailers to maintain prices of the models at a certain rate, with those retailers being contacted if models were then sold at "inappropriate" prices, the FT said. The publication also reported that the FAS "suspected" that Apple was able to terminate sales agreements if the set pricing structure was not adhered to. The FAS said in its statement that during the course of the proceedings, Apple's Russia subsidiary "actively cooperated" with the antimonopoly agency. A fine has not been announced and Apple has three months to challenge the decision in court once the full decision is published later this month, the FT said. Microsoft's board appointment LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman has joined Microsoft's board of directors, where he is set to work on various technologies including Artificial intelligence (AI), the exec announced yesterday via LinkedIn. Hoffman said that from his position on the board he will continue to focus on helping LinkedIn "fulfill its mission increasing the economic productivity of individual professionals and the companies they work for". He added that he will be focusing on Microsoft's presence in Silicon Valley. "I'll also contribute more broadly as Microsoft deepens its presence in Silicon Valley and continues to weave social, AI and other technologies into its products," Hoffman said. Microsoft bought LinkedIn in June 2016 for $26.3 billion. Fortinet's additions Fortinet has announced the addition of AlgoSec, Attivo Networks, Cisco, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Nuage Networks from Nokia, Silver Peak, VeloCloud and Versa Networks to its Fabric-Ready program. The program is designed to enable multiple vendors' security solutions to share actionable threat intelligence and mitigation information in real-time, Fortinet said. The latest additions are designed to extend Fortinet's security fabric capabilities across cloud, virtualized and software-defined environments, according to Fortinet's announcement, which added that the program also allows for interoperability and will provide the partner vendors joint go-to-market initiatives.

Russia’s Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) claims that Apple worked with 16 major resellers to set the price at which they were allowed to sell the iPhone 5s, iPhone 5c, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. Apple allegedly monitored the retail prices of its phones at the resellers and would even e-mail them if they found “inappropriate” pricing. The Federal Antimonopoly Service suggested that Apple may have been able to terminate contracts with resellers at any time, thus potentially strong-arming them into pricing compliance. Andrey Tsarikovsky, Deputy Head of FAS Russia, said that during the course of the investigation, Apple’s Russian subsidiary actively cooperated with the FAS, adding that Apple has adopted the necessary measures to eliminate violations of the law and is pursuing a policy to prevent similar violations in the future. The Financial Times notes that Apple will have around three months to challenge the matter once the full decision is published later this month. The Cupertino-based company could face a fine of as much as 15 percent of sales from the region. An Apple spokesperson told the publication that they worked closely with the FAS during their investigation and are glad to put the matter behind them.

Rishabh Jain International Business TimesMarch 14, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share The new model of the iPad Pro could launch in early April at the inauguration event for Apple Park, according to a report.More Apple has moved the production of the 10.5-inch iPad Pro 2 to March from its earlier plans of starting in May-June, according to a report emerging Tuesday. The report, citing Apple’s Taiwan-based supply chain sources further stated that Apple could launch the said iPad model at an event marking the inauguration of its Apple Park, including the new spaceship campus. The DigiTimes report published Tuesday states that both the 10.5-inch model and the 12.9-inch model could have a mid-tier and high-end pricing respectively. Read: Apple Releases Info On 10.5-inch iPad Pro Apart from the 10.5-inch model, Apple is expected to launch a 9.7-inch model and a 12.9-inch model of the iPad Pro 2. The report adds that while the production for the 9.7-inch model of the tablet is expected to reach 3-4 million units per month in the first quarter of financial year 2017 and grow during the next quarter, no production schedule was available for the 12.9-inch model. The reported numbers indicate how Apple is still standing strong in a tablet industry, which is declining every year. There is a possibility that Apple might launch the 10.5-inch iPad Pro 2 first, and then go in for a May-June production schedule, indicative of an even later launch. The production of the 10.5-inch iPad Pro 2 is expected to start at 1 million units in March and ramp up to 1.2 million units per month after that.  The production numbers are similar to the production numbers for the iPad Pro when it debuted in August 2015. The expected launch dates of the Apple iPad Pro have gone for a toss, since different reports are indicating different launch dates for the devices — a MacRumors report on Monday stated that the tablets could launch between March 20-24, while an earlier report said that the tablets could be launched on April 4, going by the availability date for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro on Apple website.  Read: Apple Pencil 2 Emerges In Company’s Patent Application The iPad Pro 2 is expected to have features like a Touch Bar, Apple Pencil 2, A10X chipset, a 12-megapixel rear camera and iOS 10.3 and therefore, could be Apple’s flagship tablet for 2017.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « New Study Covers Current and Future Trends in Smartphones, Digital Assistants, Wearables and More | Main | Apple Watch Invention Aims to Extend Activities and Monitoring Data for Cyclists » March 15, 2017 Apple iDevice Partner Pegatron Humorously States that they'll consider a U.S. iDevice Plant if Apple Absorbs the Costs   Back in November Patently Apple posted a report titled "Apple Reportedly Preparing a Responsible U.S. iPhone Plant Back-Up Business Plan." In that report we noted that "Apple asked both Foxconn and Pegatron, the two iPhone assemblers, in June 2016 to look into making iPhones in the U.S." Reportedly "Foxconn complied, while Pegatron declined to formulate such a plan due to cost concerns." Since that time a lot has changed.   Foxconn appears to have lost interest in the project and Apple's CEO decided to open a plant instead in India where they could access slave-like wages and work with a government that would close a blind eye to their use of materials from slave camps.   So as the dream of an iPhone plant in the U.S. fades into the sunset, Pegatron appears to want a little good PR and is now open to the idea of an American iPhone plant. The catch in this make believe offer is the punchline. They're open to starting a U.S. iPhone plant if Apple would absorb the costs of such a plant. Ha! I needed a good laugh today, and this news just hit my funny bone dead on.   Pegatron currently has iDevice plants in Taiwan, China, Mexico and the Czech Republic. If for any reason Apple products are actually made in Mexico for the American market, then it's here where it could force Apple to support a U.S. Plant. That's the only thing that may put a plan into real action.   But on the surface, the report from the Focus Taiwan today is rather humorous considering Pegatron's initial revulsion to the idea of a U.S. Plant.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

By Alex Eule March 15, 2017 11:49 a.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Apple has a $50 billion business growing within it. That’s how much annual revenue offerings like iCloud, AppleCare and the App Store could generate by 2020. Photo: Agence France-Presse/Getty Images An analyst bumped his price target by 10% on Wednesday, and he barely even mentioned the iPhone. More from Barron’s Next Apple: Maybe It’s Time to Focus Less on the iPhone Apple: Sales of iPhone, iPad and Mac All Shrink But Better Signs Ahead Here Comes The iPhone ‘Supercycle’ Apple has been talking up its services business recently, but RBC Capital Markets says the opportunity from things like the App Store, iTunes, Apple Care, and iCloud are still under appreciated by investors. Services could be a $50 billion business by Apple’s 2020 fiscal year, RBC analyst Amit Daryanani wrote in a note to clients Tuesday night. Apple’s total revenue last year was $215 billion, but the real benefit of services is that Apple converts those sales into profit at a rate higher than the company’s average. That means as Apple’s service revenue grows, the company’s profit margin heads higher. Meanwhile, services provide a stable stream of revenue, unlike the more cyclical nature of iPhones and iPads, which see sales bumps timed to once-yearly upgrades. The consistent sales flow is one reason investors tend to pay more for software and services companies than they do for hardware-dominated businesses like Apple. “We see potential for upside to Apple’s current valuation if the company were to continue to increase its mix of higher margin, less cyclical services revenue over time,” Daryanani wrote. He thinks investors could be willing to pay 17 times each dollar of earnings. Apple’s price-to-earnings multiple currently is closer to 15. Daryanani upped his price target on Apple stock to $155 from $140. Shares recently traded at $139. Big Picture: Apple has a growing services business -- think Apple Care, iCloud, and the App Store -- that could prove enticing to investors.

LIKE   TWEET   SHARE   PIN   SHARE   POST MAIL MORE Posted March 15, 2017 at 4:56pm by iClarified · 3587 views · Translate Apple could update the 9.7-inch iPad Pro without a special event, according to Japanese analysts via Macotakara. There have been rumors of an Apple iPad event in March and April but sources believe that Apple plans on announcing the iPad Pro 2 (9.7-inch) next week. Given that invites haven't been sent out yet, perhaps Apple will update the device without debuting it at a press event. However, as there is not information about Chinese supplier and media event is not scheduled, part of Japanese analysts predicts that what will be announced next week might be the iPad Pro 2 (9.7-inch). The new 9.7-inch iPad Pro 2 is said to have basically the same specifications as current 9.7-inch iPad Pro except it will get an A10X chip. Apple is allegedly planning to unveil a new 7.9-inch iPad Pro mini, 10.5-inch iPad Pro with slim bezels, and an updated 12.9-inch iPad Pro in the near future.

The growing services business, which Apple intends to double in four years, could reduce the laser focus of investors on the phone replacement cycle each year, wrote Amit Daryanani in a note on Tuesday. "It's the ecosystem, not just hardware," he wrote. Daryanani estimates that the largest components of Apple's services business are currently: The App store (3.9 percent of total revenue) iTunes/Apple Music (2.5 percent) AppleCare (1.9 percent) Licensing and other services like iCloud (2.7 percent) Shares of Apple were up 20 percent year to date as of Tuesday's close after first-quarter earnings reflected higher-than-expected iPhone sales. The stock's movement still largely depends on iPhone sales. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, which tends to favor businesses with steady revenue streams, more than doubled its stake in the company in January.

Latest: Multiple sources predict that the iPhone 8 will miss its expected September launch, due to delays related to its new 3D camera, and could be called 'iPhone Edition' by David Price | 15 Mar 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments Contents When will the iPhone 8 be released? What will the iPhone 8 look like? What new features will we see on the iPhone 8? What tech specs will the iPhone 8 get? How much will the iPhone 8 cost in the UK? Leaked images and videos of the iPhone 8 When will the new iPhone 8 be released in the UK, and how different will it be from the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus? (Or will the next generation of Apple smartphones be called the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus?) And what tech specs and new features should we expect from Apple's new iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus? The iPhone 8 rumour mill is heating up especially as 2017 is the 10th anniversary of the launch of the iPhone and as a result there are high hopes for the next model. Apple unveiled the new iPhone 7 alongside its bigger sibling the iPhone 7 Plus during a special event in September 2016, so we're now looking ahead to the next generation. In this article, we round up all the rumours about the iPhone 8: the iPhone 8's UK release date (and on sale date), iPhone 8 UK price, iPhone 8 specs and new features. There's a lot to cover, so let's get started. (We also look at the rumours surrounding the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus here.) For advice on the current iPhone range, read our iPhone buying guide and best cheap iPhone deals UK. Or, if you'd like to look even further into the future (covering tech developments that come perilously close to the realms of science-fiction), read iPhone 9 and beyond: From graphene to motion charging. Header/thumbnail image is a concept illustration by Handy Abo Vergleich. Recent updates Rumours point to new branding for late-2017 iPhone: iPhone Edition, or iPhone X Multiple sources suggest the iPhone 8 launch may face months of delays - perhaps even arriving after Christmas Lovely concept illustrations: mockups by AlHasan Husni show bezel-free curved screen, while Gabor Balogh focuses on augmented reality and the new function area The iPhone 8 will feature a curved OLED screen like the Samsung Galaxy Edge, apparently (but another researcher has contradicted this) Rumours that Lightning port will be replaced by USB-C (while others predict fast-charging via the existing Lightning port) Ming Chi Kuo predicts that the iPhone 8's screen will have a function area for virtual buttons, like the MacBook Pro's Touch Bar... ...as well as a monstrous screen pixel density of 521 pixels per inch, and a major increase in battery capacity The iPhone 8's lowest storage option will be 64GB (with 256GB as the alternative) Wireless charging rumours spread as Apple joins Wireless Power Consortium... ...but analysts predict wireless charging will require a separate accessory Possibility that there will be no physical buttons at all iPhone 8 expected to break thousand-dollar barrier for first time New predictions that Touch ID will be built into the iPhone 8's display and will be joined by a new security feature: facial recognition. When will the iPhone 8 be released? The iPhone 8 is likely to be released in September 2017, but there are whispers of a delay. Before we think about new features you should expect in the iPhones of the future, let's talk about the likely release date schedule. Apple's latest batch of smartphones, the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus, were released in the autumn of 2016. (Read more: iPhone 7 review and iPhone 7 Plus review.) Apple always releases new iPhones in September, and we assume this year will be the same. Delays Logic and history both point to September, then, but multiple sources are suggesting that Apple may miss its usual date with smartphone destiny. Digitimes has predicted that "production for the new OLED iPhone is unlikely to start until September due to the redesigned fingerprint ID solution", and KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has stated that there will not be time to implement the expected new 3D camera system unless Apple pushes back the launch date of the new iPhones: "Unless production of the OLED iPhone (expected to begin in September) gets pushed back, there is virtually no time to make changes to the 3D camera system." (Both via Business Insider.) It's also believed that the expected 3D camera scanner is presenting production difficulties. ST Microelectronics, the company tipped to make this component for Apple, are - according to SlashGear's sources - struggling to hit volume targets and have requested additional time. "That would mesh with earlier rumours that Apple won't even start mass producing the iPhone 8 until September," says the site, "the very month the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus are scheduled to launch. Depending on the yield rate for the revolutionary iPhone, we probably don't expect to see it in the market until a month or two later." It's unclear at this point if the reported "small fire" at ST Microelectronics' manufacturing plant is going to be a factor in all this. It will be a major surprise if new iPhones are not unveiled in September, but we'll keep our ears open for further whispers suggesting a delay. Future release schedules After autumn 2017 it gets harder to predict. Based on the past few years of Apple launches, the generation after that logically ought to be an S update: the iPhone 7s and the iPhone 7s Plus, launched together in autumn 2017 (with the potential of an iPhone SE 2 in spring of 2017, or moved back to launch with them in the autumn). The iPhone 8 - as well as the iPhone 8 Plus - would then finally be unveiled in September 2018. Sept 2016: iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus Mar 2017: iPhone SE 2 Sept 2017: iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus Mar 2018: iPhone SE 3 Sept 2018: iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus But it may not be that simple. And there are widespread rumours that Apple is going to miss out the iPhone 7s generation - or fold it in with the iPhone 8 launch, in autumn 2017. The end of the iPhone 'S' convention It's possible that Apple won't continue the S generation strategy for much longer. Many of us have pointed out that this 'tick-tock' system is a risky policy, tacitly acknowledging that iPhone generations alternate between major and minor updates - to be especially harsh, you could say worthwhile and superfluous updates. When the average user hears that the new iPhone hasn't even been considered worthy of a full version number upgrade, they'll be put off from spending money on the new offering. Not to mention that an S update is more confusing for buyers: iPhone 6 followed by iPhone 7 would have been clear and easy to understand; but it's less obvious which out of the iPhone 6, 6s, 6 Plus and 6s Plus is the more advanced model. On this principle, therefore, we could see the iPhone 7 in autumn 2016 and the iPhone 8 the year after. At this point, nobody knows - but as soon as we hear more, we'll update this article. And in October 2016 a little extra weight was added to the 'iPhone 8 in 2017' theory. According to Business Insider, an Apple employee in Israel who solders components spoke to them about the next iPhone and referred to it as the iPhone 8 "unprompted in our conversation". The source added that the iPhone 8 would be "different" from the iPhone 6s and iPhone 7, and have a better camera - neither of which are particularly out-there predictions. Some pundits predicted that the iPhone 7 would sell comparatively poorly because of its perceived lack of major new features and design changes. But, they said, everything would change in 2017, when the iPhone 8 blows everyone away with a wide and radical range of enhancements. Pundits are increasingly predicting a big iPhone launch in 2017. Making predictions about the upcoming performance of Apple stock, analysts at Credit Suisse have forecast that the iPhone 8, to be released on the iPhone's 10-year anniversary in 2017 (skipping the 'S' generation in recognition of its major updates) will feature "significant innovations" such as a full-glass OLED screen, new and upgraded haptic feedback features, wireless charging and numerous major specs improvements including the camera and processor. Kulbinder Garcha, one of the company's analysts, was sufficiently confident about the iPhone 8's performance to predict sales of 250 million units in fiscal 2018 (despite launching in the calendar year 2017, the iPhone 8's sales will be reported in 2018), compared to 215 million in 2017. Garcha may be confident, but we're not so sure. Going three years between substantive updates to what remains by far its most profitable line in order to make a big launch match a big anniversary feels like a strange and risky strategy for Apple (we don't subscribe to Nikkei's theory that the company will follow a three-year cycle from now on), and with the Android sector pushing boundaries in a lot of ways this would inevitably result in accusations of stagnation - even more so than now. Read next: Best place to buy an iPhone in the UK But what happens after the blockbusting launch of the iPhone 8 (or Tenth Anniversary iPhone)? It might not get pretty, if some researchers are to be believed. One analyst, Andrew Uerkwitz, has predicted that the 2017 iPhone refresh will be the company's "last growth hurrah", before spiralling into a "decade-long malaise" as the market turns increasingly to lower-cost and second-hand phones. "The risks to the company have never been greater," Uerkwitz said to MarketWatch. Monness Crespi Hardt analyst James Cakmak echoed Uerkwitz's sentiments. "Apple won't have it easy again for a while, if ever," he said. 'iPhone 8 production ahead of schedule' According to BlueFin Research Partners, the production of the iPhone 8 is ramping up earlier than expected. "The most intriguing data points that we have uncovered suggests that AAPL is ramping the next generation iPhones earlier than historical norms," write analysts John Donovan and Steve Mullane, "although we have no indication that there has been any change in release plans for the iPhone 8/X. "Our present reads suggest a 300 percent increase in iPhone 8/X builds in the June quarter, now sitting at 9M... In the past, builds of upcoming releases began in earnest early in the September quarter, so this is a departure from AAPL's normal build cadence." As the analysts point out, this may not indicate an earlier release date for the iPhone 8. 'iPhone X' Here's a leftfield prediction: Apple may not call its late-2017 smartphone the iPhone 7s or the iPhone 8, but the iPhone X. Timothy Arcuri, an analyst at Cowen and Company, has sent out a research note to clients predicting among other things that the late-2017 iPhone update will be branded as iPhone X - X in this case evidently signifying the Roman numeral for 10, since the iPhone is celebrating its 10th birthday in 2017. With iPhone version numbers getting alarmingly high, it would make sense for Apple to switch to a different branding convention at some point - distracting customers, one might say, from quite how many of these things Apple has cranked out without fundamentally changing what it's offering. But to rebrand its biggest seller would still be a bold, bold move. We'll count this as unlikely until we hear evidence to back it up, even though it's not the worst idea in the world. 'iPhone Edition' And here's one more: Mac Otakara is now predicting that the late-2017 iPhone will be called 'iPhone Edition'. This would echo the branding of the most expensive model of Apple Watch, and thus impart a certain premium feel, but we had the impression Apple was pulling away from the Apple Watch Edition. We'd guess that it hasn't sold too many of those £13,000 gold watches. Macworld poll: What do you think Apple will call its next iPhone? Can Donald Trump persuade Apple to build iPhones in the US? Donald Trump spent much of his recent presidential campaign complaining about Apple and its offshore manufacturing operations, and promising he would make the company build its iPhones in the US. (The only major Apple product currently made on American shores is the Mac Pro.) Now, as President-Elect Trump, he's trying to make his promises a reality. Speaking to the New York Times, Trump claimed to have spoken on the phone with Tim Cook - implying, indeed, that Cook initiated the call - and reached what sounds like a degree of understanding you might not expect from two men with such different temperaments and political leanings. "I got a call from Tim Cook at Apple, and I said, 'Tim, you know one of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States, where instead of going to China, and going to Vietnam, and going to the places that you go to, you're making your product right here.' He said, 'I understand that.'" Read next: Where are Apple products made? Apple has its reasons for building its smartphones in Asia, of course: labour costs are lower and there is, according to Cook, a shortage of relevant skills in the US. Moving manufacturing to America would lose Apple a lot of money. But Trump thinks he can sweeten the deal with tax cuts and changes to regulations. "I said: 'I think we'll create the incentives for you, and I think you're going to do it. We're going for a very large tax cut for corporations, which you'll be happy about.' But we're going for big tax cuts, we have to get rid of regulations, regulations are making it impossible. Whether you're liberal or conservative, I mean I could sit down and show you regulations that anybody would agree are ridiculous. It's gotten to be a free-for-all. And companies can't, they can't even start up, they can't expand, they're choking." What Trump did not claim - and past behaviour suggests he'd be singing it from the rooftops - is that Cook actually agreed to any of this, even in principle. He may understand where Trump is coming from, and Trump may have given him the hard sell, but it would be a huge step if Apple actually does move any kind of significant proportion of its device manufacture to the US. Since then, Trump has stated in an interview with Axios that Tim Cook has his "eyes open" to the idea of building iPhones in the US, and that he "really believes [Cook] loves this country and I think he'd like to do something major here", whatever that means. These statements read less like an update on the progress of negotiations and more like a public blackmail campaign, but it might just work. Trump has been underestimated before. Foxconn's US expansion There was another twist in this tale when it emerged on 7 December that iPhone manufacturer Foxconn is indeed pondering an expansion of its (currently relatively small-scale) US operations, in a move that is apparently expected to involve $7bn of investment and create 50,000 jobs. Strangely, nobody involved made much of a deal about this. But eagle-eyed journalists spotted that paperwork being shown off to publicise SoftBank's US investment deal (which Donald Trump has made a huge song and dance about) also featured Foxconn's logo, and appeared to suggest that the second figure in each pair of numbers referred to that company. (Picture credit: CNBC) Foxconn has since confirmed that it is in talks about expanding its US operations, although it has declined to comment on the figures given. "While the scope of the potential investment has not been determined, we will announce the details of any plans following the completion of direct discussions between our leadership and the relevant US officials," the firm said in a statement, according to Reuters. Other Apple products made in the US Apple does build some products in the US, if rarely, and only in the cases of far lower-volume products than the iPhone. It has made a lot out of its US Mac Pro assembly, for instance, but this is a niche product made in comparatively low numbers. In January 2017 - a couple of weeks ahead of Trump's inauguration - Apple applied to expand the use of a manufacturing facility it owns in Mesa, Arizona. Rather than iPhones or even recognisable consumer products, it was widely reported that Apple would be building data server cabinets for its own internal use, but the firm has since denied this, claiming it will only be using the facility as a hub for receiving, configuring and distributing servers rather than manufacturing any new product. Now, what new features and tech developments can we expect in the next few generations of Apple smartphone? What will the iPhone 8 look like? iPhones are that lethal combination of expensive and fragile that results in so much consumer heartache. The result is that each iPhone owner has to make their own deal with the devil: either wrapping it in a robust case, thereby masking the handsome design that they paid all that money for in the first place, or risk pavement damage every time they take the thing out of a pocket. But design changes may mean this is not the case in the future. Here are the design changes we expect in the iPhone 8. Read next: How to repair a cracked iPhone screen OLED, curved display Wall Street Journal sources claim that the iPhone 8 will have a flexible curved display like the one featured on Samsung's Galaxy S6 Edge. The report is behind a paywall but can be read here. This model of the iPhone will apparently cost $1000 and will be a premium option, alongside the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus. The OLED screens will be supplied by Samsung initially, according to the WSJ report. Apparently these screens will also be brighter and show colours better. A Business Korea report claims that Apple intends to move the line up to OLED displays as it would offer better colour saturation, accuracy, and brightness. Apparently this new phone won't arrive until 2018, though. This isn't the first report in the Wall Street Journal to claim that a curved screen iPhone could be in the works. Last November a similar report was published here, claiming that Apple's Asia suppliers had been asked to increase output of thinner organic light-emitting displays for the company. Later in February 2017, however, Research firm TrendForce contradicted this prediction. "Apple will not implement the curved display design for the high-end iPhone," said the firm, "because there are issues with the 3D glass in terms of production yield and drop test results." USB-C The WSJ report cited above also claims that the new iPhone 8 will drop the Lightning port in favour of USB Type-C. This would be a huge call, so soon after Apple removed the headphone port on the principle that the Lightning port was a better alternative. And there are other reasons to be sceptical: Apple is rarely swayed by demands for universal rather than proprietary ports, and everybody yelled last time the company switched out the 30-pin connector in favour of Lightning - a lot of accessory makers (and accessory owners) would be sorely inconvenienced. We are not entirely convinced, to say the least. And neither is Ming Chi Kuo, who thinks the iPhone 8 will fast-charge through the Lightning port rather than bringing in USB-C. He predicts that Apple will tweak the underlying power management technology, adding "Type-C Power Delivery", rather than replacing the Lightning port altogether. The Verge believes this means that the cable will have Lightning on one end and USB-C on the other, although this isn't specified in the research note. 10th-anniversary redesign will be 'a big f**king deal' The year 2017 (June the 29th, to be precise) marks the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, and some suggest that Apple will want to come up with a real blockbuster of a redesign to celebrate. Noted tech blogger Robert Scoble has posted an exhaustive list of predictions for next year's iPhone, and he expects big things. "It's the 10th anniversary of the iPhone," he writes. "It's the first product introduction in Apple's new amazing headquarters. It's a big f**king deal and will change this industry deeply." (Those are Scoble's asterisks.) Design-wise, he expects that the iPhone 8 "will be, I am told, a clear piece of glass (er, Gorilla Glass sandwich with other polycarbonates for being pretty shatter resistant if dropped) with a next-generation OLED screen (I have several sources confirming this). You pop it into a headset which has eye sensors on it, which enables the next iPhone to have a higher apparent frame rate and polygon count than a PC with a Nvidia 1080 card in it." He also says to expect "battery and antennas to be hidden around the edges of the screen, which explains how Apple will fit in some of the pieces even while most of the chips that make up a phone are in a pack/strip at the bottom of the phone". But the range of features Scoble is expecting is overwhelming. You really need to read the post for yourself. Scoble isn't the only one predicting a big redesign for 2017. French site nowhereelse.fr has shared a leaked image (below), which appears to showcase the exact dimensions of the iPhone 7. These dimensions are identical to the ones found on the iPhone 6s, measuring 67.12mm wide and 138.3mm tall. Through this image, it would appear that there also won't be any change to the camera (there have been rumours about a dual camera system as you'll discover later in this article). The image has the OnLeaks stamp on it, and OnLeaks has been reliable with Apple leaks in the past. Glass front and back, with stainless steel option 9to5Mac has got hold of a report from the ever-quotable and usually reliable Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities - a report that predicts, based on the popularity of the scratch-prone Jet Black iPhone 7, that the iPhone 8 will have a (more scratch-resistant) glass front and back. "If Apple does follow through with what KGI suggests, an all glass design could extend the glossy finish to all colours of the iPhone lineup depending on how Apple handles the design," 9to5mac says. DigiTimes (a Chinese-language website), predicts that the chassis of the iPhone 8 will be made of stainless steel and supplied by Jabil rather than the more usual manufacturing partner Foxconn, citing anonymous sources in the Asian /supply chain. The site later clarified that it expects the iPhone 8 to be made of glass and steel, but that the iPhone 7s may still have a body made of aluminium alloy. This would be something of a surprise, given Apple's clear recent preference for aluminium; the iPhone 4s had steel bands around a glass body, but it's been all aluminium ever since. And we're given to understand that the engineering method will be different this time: whereas the iPhone 4s was milled, the iPhone 7 metalwork will be forged, a technique that offers greater strength. New colour options There have been various rumours about new colour finishes, focusing on two possibilities: dark blue, and red. According to a report from Macotakara, the iPhone 7 will come in Silver, Gold, Rose Gold and a new Deep Blue. This seems entirely possible. Samsung offers blue flagship phones that seem to be among the more popular options, so Apple might decide to follow Samsung's lead. Following the reports from Mac Otakara, designer Martin Hajek published some gorgeous concept images of a Deep Blue iPhone. See more over on Martin's website. (Shortly after the Deep Blue rumours emerged, a second colour rumour came to light on the same blog. Macotakara now said that Space Black would be introduced instead of Deep Blue to replace the current Space Grey option. And while the names were different - black and Jet Black, in fact - Apple did indeed replace Space Grey with black colour options. Does this leave Deep Blue for the next generation?) More recently, Macotakara has been reporting a new colour rumour, predicting that the 2017 iPhones will be available in red. Apple Watch-style Digital Crown Some of the more out-there concept illustrators have considered the idea of Apple giving the iPhone 7 a rotating control, like the Digital Crown on the Apple Watch. But the rest of us thought it was a crazy idea. But it might just be so crazy that it actually happens, if a new Apple patent is anything to go by. The patent, spotted like so many of these things by Patently Apple, is illustrated with images of an iPad but is described in sufficiently broad terms that it could easily apply to an iPhone too. The patent suggests that the rotating control could to adjust volume, resize text and various other functions, and all of this makes a certain sense; but does anyone honestly think it's something Apple would really do with its elegant clean iPhone? Our strong suspicion is that this is one of those patents Apple and other tech companies periodically take out in order to mislead rivals and cover moonshot concepts that are extremely unlikely to lead anywhere. No more bezels above and below screen Apple has been awarded a patent that covers the embedding of light sensors within the layers of a display, leading to speculation that the firm intends to remove the bezels from its next iPhone. Indeed, the patent - US Patent 9,466,653 - specifically describes the tiresome current necessity for bezels in the background section: "In a typical device, a light sensor is laterally displaced from an active display region of the display along a front face of the device. Additional space is therefore provided in common devices at the top, bottom, or side of the active display area to accommodate the light sensor." Instead, the patent proposes to integrate the sensor within the display: "The light sensor is a display-integrated light sensor that is integrated into the layers of the display. The light sensor may [be] interposed between the cover layer and another layer of the display such as the touch-sensitive layer, the light-generating layers, or another display layer." This is Fig. 11 of the patent's illustrations, showing "a display-integrated light sensor attached to a thin-film transistor layer of a bottom emission organic light-emitting diode display". In January 2017 yet another patent was added to the pile of evidence that Apple plans to give the iPhone 8 an edge-to-edge screen. Patent 9,543,364, granted on 10 January, covers "Electronic devices having displays with openings" and various means by which Apple would be able to hide cameras, sensors and controls behind the screen and still allow the user to access them. This in turn would allow Apple to expand the screen outwards to cover the full face of the device, since it wouldn't need to leave space around the edge for those various apertures and controls. Of course, another hardware element that's currently built into the bezel at the bottom of the iPhone is the Home button. Which leads to our next section... No more physical home button (and Touch ID built into the display) Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster (a well-known industry pundit, but one who has come in for a fair amount of ribbing after regularly predicting that Apple would launch a television), suggested the iPhone 7 wouldn't have a Home button, thanks to the new 3D Touch technology introduced with the iPhone 6s. He felt that the new tech provides Apple with a way to eliminate the home button, instead using the additional space to make the screen bigger or the device smaller. The issue with Munster's theory is that the Touch ID would need to move, as it is currently situated beneath the home button on Apple's iPhones and iPads. However, as we discuss below, Apple has been investigating ways to build the Touch ID sensor into the screen itself. Munster's speculation about the iPhone 7 didn't prove to be true, but may yet happen on the iPhone 8, and there's now more evidence to back up his claims. You can read about Apple's new Touch ID-related patents below, but reliable analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has supported Munster's prediction with claims that Apple's new Touch ID technology developments will mean it is indeed possible to put the sensor into the display itself. Kuo also claims Apple is going to add a facial recognition element into the mix. In the continuing march of miniaturisation, one of the elements of the iPhone design that's proved resistant to shrinkage is the bezel below the screen - it can't get much smaller than it already is because it needs to house the Home button. Which is why a recurring theory is that Apple will extend the screen down past the Home button, or even incorporate the Touch ID sensor that lives in the recent iPhones' Home button into the touchscreen. Technology that would facilitate such a development was recently announced by a biometric R&D company called Sonavation. The tech would enable Apple (which is known to use Gorilla Glass in its iPhones, even if the supplier is apparently not permitted to say this publicly) to run the screen vertically edge-to-edge, with no cut-out for the Home button. The Home button could occupy the same position but appear only when needed, much like the software keyboard; and the technology for Touch ID would be bonded to the underside of the screen at the appropriate point. Last year Apple filed a patent that appeared to back up the theory that it's looking into ideas like this. Patent application number 20150036065, for "a fingerprint sensor... incorporated in a display stack in an electronic device", was filed by a number of Apple's engineers in April 2014 and published recently. Here are some of the accompanying illustrations (although you should bear in mind that patent images are almost universally ugly, and shouldn't bear much resemblance to what the finished design would look like): The illustration in Fig. 1 above appears to show an iPhone that still has a Home button, and therefore doesn't increase the amount of screen area - what would be the point of that, you might wonder. But remember that this is to illustrate the concept, not to show what it would look like in practice. Apple has been granted a patent - a different one - that also appears to refer to a Touch ID fingerprint sensor that can work through a screen. Patent 9,460,332 describes a "Capacitive fingerprint sensor including an electrostatic lens": more intriguingly for our purposes, it states that "one or more other device components, such as a display stack and/or a touchscreen may be interposed between the contact surface of dielectric structure 202 and array 206 of capacitive sensing elements". Here's one more patent for you, this one published on 14 February 2017 (but filed back in 2013), that points to the Touch ID sensor being built into the screen. US patent 9,570,002, which is titled 'Interactive display panel with IR diodes', addresses methods for incorporating a light sensor into a screen, and the ways this could be used. It focuses on the idea of dual-purpose interactive pixels, "each interactive pixel comprising an infrared emitting light emitting diode (IR emitting LED) and a sensing infrared diode (sensing IR diode)". The display would thus be capable of both emitting and sensing light. The patent specifically discusses one instance where "the target object 1201 contains a fingerprint surface. When the fingerprint is placed upon the transparent substrate, the sensing IR diodes 1203 within the display panel 119 sense patterned IR light reflected off grooves of the fingerprint surface. This patterned IR light is relayed to the output processor 123 as a bitmap 1211 where it is processed to determine the fingerprint surface's unique pattern." Finally, DigiTimes' sources report that Apple is planning to use its own Touch ID fingerprint-sensing technology in the iPhone 8 rather than the alternatives it was understood to be considering. "Apple has selected neither Synaptics' Natural ID touch fingerprint sensor nor Qualcomm's Sense ID fingerprint technology for its new OLED iPhones," says the site, "and decided to use its own Authentec algorithm combined with Privaris glass identification technology to redesign a new fingerprint ID solution, according to industry sources." (Via MacRumors.) No physical buttons at all A February 2017 report by Fast Company, which famously predicted that the late-2017 iPhone could cost more than $1,000 mark for the first time, also raised the possibility that the device might not have any physical buttons. It cited "a source with knowledge of Apple's plans" for this prediction. "Apple has been working to remove the physical Home button from the iPhone," says the site. "It would become a button to touch, not press. There's even a chance that the physical buttons on the sides of the iPhone may go away, our source says, replaced by touch-sensitive inlays in the metal." 'Touch Bar' style function area In February 2017 Ming Chi Kuo predicted in an investor's note that the iPhone 8 would have a function area, somewhat like the Touch Bar on the 2016 MacBook Pro. That might seem a bit odd, given that the Touch Bar adds an element of software customisability and touchscreen function to an otherwise static and hardware keyboard area, whereas the iPhone's screen is already touchscreen and software-based. But the function area will take the place of the (currently non-touchscreen) lower bezel and Home button, and be somehow ringfenced for specific functions and 'virtual button' which will vary according to the app being used. Let's have Kuo explain his reasoning: "We expect the OLED iPhone will adopt a 5.8-inch physical OLED panel. But the actual display area will be around 5.15 inches, and the rest will be an area for functions (e.g. allocation of virtual buttons)." Touch ID sensors on the side of the device Korea Herald cites "a source familiar with the matter" when reporting that Apple is exploring "new sensing technologies" that could substantially change the way Touch ID works. "The upcoming iPhone may use new sensing technology," explains the site's source, "which enables the phone to respond when users touch any side of the device. But Apple may not adopt this technology." The source doesn't specify whether the new sensors are connected to Touch ID, but it seems likely: all the talk of removing bezels and physical Home buttons and expanding the screen is going to necessitate finding a new location for the fingerprint scanner. If the iPhone becomes able to sense and analyse fingerprints on any edge, that would even remove the need for a specific Touch ID 'action' - you'd just need to pick the phone up. Changes to Home button Some rumours suggest Apple is working on keeping the Home button and adding more features to it. There are two patents that have sparked these rumours, so they're both something Apple has at least considered. The first is a dynamic home button that is sensitive to gestures: you'd be able to swipe across it, or lean a thumb in one direction to scroll the screen of a game, for example, that way.  The second is pretty far out there. Essentially the concept is this: the Home button on the iPhone would be able to 'pop up' on a little spring and turn into a sort of mini-joystick for playing games. There are plenty of iOS games that would benefit from a hardware controller (this explains the enduring popularity of Bluetooth gaming controller accessories) and this sounds like a lot of fun. But gamers remain only one section of the iPhone's audience, and it seems like a risky idea to potentially compromise the resilience of everyone's iPhone Home button (which has famously been very prone to breakage in the past) for a feature that would benefit only some users. Best iPhone (and iPad) games A larger, longer earpiece While this may not be the most exciting rumour to hit the internet, the latest rumours suggest that the next iPhone is to feature a longer earpiece cutout. The rumour, first covered by Mac Otakara, states that in addition to a longer earpiece cutout, Apple is moving the ambient light sensor from the left-hand side to the right-hand side. The source is apparently manufacturers of LCD protective films on Alibaba.com that are apparently no longer receiving orders related to the upcoming iPhone.  While the rumour is unconfirmed and should be taken with a pinch of salt, but if true, it could mean that the iPhone 8 may not be compatible with iPhone 7 cases and screen protectors, even if the design is broadly the same. Curved wraparound screen According to KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who has often correctly predicted upcoming Apple products - the analyst think a forthcoming iPhone could feature a curved 5.8in AMOLED screen. If this rumour is to be true, there would be an understandable shift from Apple to get rid of the headphone jack and produce a smartphone which is immediately distinguishable over its competitors.  We're into the realm of patents here, which we would generally warn readers means we're talking about developments that could easily end up appearing in a shipped product several years down the line or not appearing at all - Apple, like most tech companies, routinely applies for far more patents than it's ever going to use. But this one has actually been granted (it was applied for a few years back) so it could be reasonably close to reality. Patent 9,146,590 refers to an "electronic device with wrap around display". And essentially it describes a curved screen that allows for more screen elements to be displayed without making the device significantly bigger. (Remember that the illustrations rarely represent what the designer has in mind. In theory the display could wrap entirely around the device, or at least extend over one edge like the Note Edge.) While the patent talks about a "flexible display assembly", it's important to note that this isn't a patent for a bendable screen: the flexible portion of the display is attached to the interior surface of the curved transparent housing, which "provides a rigid support structure that prevents deformation". Samsung Display could be set to make flexible OLED displays for the iPhone 8. The rumour stems from claims that Samsung is reaching out to display tech companies in South Korea that they're hoping will lend a hand with building the displays, as the order from Apple will be huge. Samsung may even be intending to invest billions in a new factory in which it'll manufacture the displays. At present, iPhones use LCD displays, but the Apple Watch uses a flexible OLED so it's certainly possible that Apple intends to bring the tech to the iPhone. We're not talking flexible in the same way as the patent above, though. It'll simply mean that the screen could curve around the design of the iPhone 8 more accurately, hinting further at an edge-to-edge display. It'll also likely be used to improve 3D Touch. In January 2017, the Wall Street Journal reported that the screen maker Japan Display, which already works with Apple, is ready to start building flexible displays. (This is understood to mean 'curved' rather than 'actively bendable by the user'.) While the firm didn't name Apple, it did say it is building the screens for hardware partners, and the clues point to the iPhone maker. Plastic screen The Korea Herald report we linked to earlier also discusses the screen, and the site's "source familiar with the matter" predicts that the iPhone 8 will have a display that is curved and OLED - both rumours that we've heard before - and made of plastic, which is a new one to us. "The OLED versions of the new iPhone will all have curved screens as Apple ordered only plastic OLED - not glass - from Samsung Display," reports the source. "Samsung is capable of supplying a little less than 100 million units of curved OLED displays to Apple." Sapphire glass screen iPhone screens are already far tougher than your average piece of glass (they're made of a proprietary material called Gorilla Glass), but they do sometimes crack or even shatter when dropped. Sapphire screens would be more resistant still, and Apple is already using sapphire in the display of the Apple Watch: it's possible that the company is now ready to import this material into its smartphone line-up. Rumoured plans to rely on an Apple-backed sapphire plant in Arizona (which had the capacity to manufacture 200 million 5-inch iPhone displays per year) fell through. But more recent reports suggest that long-term Apple supplier Foxconn is gearing up to build its own sapphire plant in Taiwan at a cost of $2.6bn. In August 2016, it was reported by Patently Apple that Apple filed patents for a curved glass iPhone with virtual buttons on the sides. If accurate, this could be somewhat like the rumoured OLED bar on the expected new MacBook Pro, but time will tell. The patent images also show a curved glass screen similar to that which we have now seen made popular by Samsung's Galaxy S6 edge and S7 edge. This has helped to fuel the rumours that Apple is planning a major redesign for the iPhone 8 to coincide with the tenth anniversary of the iPhone. Either way, it'll have to be significantly different to Samsung's efforts to avoid Apple being accused of plagiarism. Then again, most smartphones of the past decade have aped the original iPhone, so we're sure that wouldn't prove problematic for Apple - particularly since these patents show its legal right to product the devices in this way. Read more: What is Sapphire glass, and why is it a good idea for the iPhone? Project Phire Corning, the company that makes Gorilla Glass, responded to the looming threat of sapphire glass in early 2015 with the announcement of an ultra-hardened composite material codenamed Project Phire. James Clappin, president of Corning Glass Technologies, told investors: "We told you last year that sapphire was great for scratch performance but didn't fare well when dropped. So we created a product that offers the same superior damage resistance and drop performance of Gorilla Glass 4 with scratch resistance that approaches sapphire." Apple never discusses the materials it uses for iPhone screens, but it's great news for consumers that suppliers are jousting to provide the best and most durable screen glass. Read more about Project Phire here. Graphene Sapphire glass is already being used on the non-Sport models of the Apple Watch, and Project Phire appears to be in a reasonably advanced state of development, but we're getting closer to the realms of science-fiction. Graphite, the material used in standard pencils, is made up of stacks of sheets of carbon, each one only a single atom thick. This is why it's so good for writing: the layers naturally slide off on to the paper. But graphene is a different matter. Graphene is what you get if you're clever enough to isolate one of the layers in graphite, leaving you with a substance that's effectively two-dimensional. It's the thinnest substance known to man, about a million times thinner than a human hair, and for that matter quite possibly the strongest (it's 100 times stronger than steel) and a phenomenally good electrical conductor - 1,000 times better than copper. Oh, and it's virtually transparent, too. All of which makes graphene an exciting prospect for tech manufacturers. Most obviously, it would make for a tremendously durable coating material for the screen (and would lend itself to bendable displays, too) or indeed any part of the device; but it could really appear in almost any of the sections of this article. Graphene would be a superior replacement for silicon in processor chips, or could be used to make more efficient batteries and solar cells. It's marvellous stuff. We're also pleased to report that graphene is British - sort of. It was discovered by the Soviet-born physicist Andre Geim at the University of Manchester, where it continues to be studied. (Entertainingly, Geim is the only scientist so far to be awarded both a Nobel and an Ig Nobel prize.) If you'd like to read more about graphene, I strongly recommend the New Yorker's article on the subject. Viscoelastic material Let's move on from the screen and talk about new durable materials for the rest of the iPhone. How about a bit of drop-resistance? Based on patent activity, Apple is devising a viscoelastic material that would absorb impacts. The material would cover Apple devices and make them survive drops far better. The patent could make sense in all of Apple's mobile devices and laptops, but the iPhone is the obvious area to begin. Flexible iPhone In January 2015 Apple was awarded a patent that suggests that the company is investigating the idea of a flexible iPhone (and we're not talking about the Bendgate kind). The patent suggests that, by making the iPhone flexible, Apple could unlock a new range of controls: the user could open an app by bending the device in a particular way, for example, or use the flexibility to control a game. It's an intriguing if seemingly far-fetched concept. Additionally, a flexible iPhone flexible ought to be more resistant to impacts and therefore more durable. But we'll discuss a key element in the idea of a flexible iPhone - a screen that can bend without breaking - in the screen tech section. What new features will we see on the iPhone 8? That covers design. But what new features should we expect in the iPhone 8? Fast charging According to Forbes citing infamous Apple leaker Sonny Dickson, the iPhone 8 could be the first entry in the iPhone series to feature fast charging technology. More specifically, Forbes claims that there will be a new "Tristar 3, Hydra" chip that manages the charging port. "In normal people words... [it] will include fast charging," Dickson claims.  However, it's worth noting that if fast charging tech is included in the upcoming iPhone, it may not be compatible with existing fast charging standards as the tech isn't being produced by Qualcomm, which provides "Quick Charge" for Android devices. But the feature has long been requested by users, and is one readily available on most if not all of Apple's Android-based competitors. In February 2017, analyst Ming Chi Kuo predicted that the iPhone 8 will feature fast-charging technology - delivering this, incidentally, via a tweaked version of the existing Lightning port rather than by bringing in USB-C as was previously expected. He predicts that Apple will add "Type-C Power Delivery" to the Lightning port's spec. Tap to wake According to Forbes, one of the three (yes, three) variants of iPhone 8 will feature 'tap to wake' technology that has been available for budget Android users for quite some time. While the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus (sporting the same design as the 6/7) will miss out on the technology, the all-new iPhone 8 should get the 'tap to wake' treatment. This strikes us as a little odd as it's a feature available on budget Android smartphones, so why wouldn't it be on Apple's flagship? Also, Forbes source claims that it's "currently on the roadmap" for the iPhone 8 only, so there's still a chance this may change before release later this year. Smart connector Could the iPhone 8 get a smart connector, like those used on the 9.7in and 12.9in iPad Pro collection? Of course, as with any rumour/leak it's best to take it with a pinch of salt but according to a report from Mac Otakara, a forthcoming iPhone will feature a smart connector. More recently, Logitech (or Logi?) has launched the Logi Base, the first accessory to utilise the iPad Pro smart connector for charging capabilities. As first reported by AppleInsider, the Base uses magnets to easily line up the iPad Pro with the charger, providing users with something close to wireless charging. It also means that you can pick up the iPad and walk away without needing to unplug it. While it's specific to the iPad Pro, it gives you an idea about what a smart connector on an iPhone could be used for.  Wireless charging Wireless charging didn't arrive with the iPhone 7 as some had predicted (it has also been predicted for previous iPhone models stretching back some years), even though Apple has been offering the feature for a while now in the form of the Apple Watch's inductive charging. As iMore's Rene Ritchie points out, inductive charging hasn't been practical for the iPhone in previous years because the technology available at the time didn't work through an aluminium backplate, but the Apple Watch can offer wireless charging because it has a ceramic back. In July 2015 Qualcomm announced a wireless charging breakthrough that does work through metal. This was obviously too late for the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus which appeared only two months later, and didn't make it into the iPhone 7 either. But the technology may appear in the iPhone 8 generation. And the iPhone 8 may have a glass back in any case. So the iPhone's main obstacles to wireless charging are disappearing fast. Indeed, Foxconn - one of the large manufacturing firms that assembles iPhones for Apple - is reported to be testing wireless charging modules that will be included in some or all of the 2017 iPhones (it would make a neat point of differentiation for the iPhone 8 Plus) if the tests prove satisfactory. The questions at this point relate to yield rate and profitability: Foxconn is exploring the practicality of producing large batches of the component to a satisfactory standard. Further strong evidence was added to the chances of Apple bringing wireless charging to the next iPhone in February 2017, when it emerged that Apple has joined the Wireless Power Consortium industry group, as spotted by 9to5Mac. Speaking to Business Insider, an Apple representative said: "Apple is an active member of many standards development organisations, as both a leader and contributor. Apple is joining the Wireless Power Consortium to be able to participate and contribute ideas to the open, collaborative development of future wireless charging standards. We look forward to working together with the WPC and its members." The Wireless Power Consortium itself added a further statement. "The companies with the largest market share in mobile phones are now members of the WPC and discussing the standardisation of wireless charging," the group said. "As we have seen in the past year, Qi has become the de facto standard for wireless power, and this year we expect to see even more momentum by the entire ecosystem." Research & analysis firm KGI Securities, and their famous analyst Ming Chi Kuo in particular, released a report in February 2017 making a firm prediction that all three iPhone models to be released in autumn 2017 will feature wireless charging, although Kuo warned that the feature would increase production costs. The charging element will generate more heat inside the body of the device than traditional charging techniques, which means Apple will have to incorporate a new protective graphite layer so that the 3D Touch component isn't damaged. Wireless charging sounds amazing, but we should stress that at the moment inductive charging has a very short range; so you wouldn't be able to just sit at your desk and have your iPhone (in your pocket) charge from the plug several feet away. Rather, you'd place the device on a wired mat. Convenient, but not quite as space-age as it might have sounded when we talked about 'wireless charging'. If you can't wait until the iPhone 8 to start charging your iPhone wirelessly, read How to wirelessly charge your iPhone. Long-range wireless charging We say that inductive charging is disappointingly short-range, but Bloomberg reckons Apple is working on longer-range wireless charging, potentially charging at a distance of about 1 metre using near-field magnetic resonance. And while this seems more of a long shot, some cryptic comments from the CEO of a charging company suggest Apple may be planning something even more ambitious. Steve Rizzone, CEO of Energous, spoke to The Verge before CES 2017 and dropped some clanking great hints about the exclusive and secret "key strategic partnership" that the company signed a couple of years back and which has delayed the launch of its wireless charging tech... which has a range of 15 feet. "That 'key' partner is suspected to be Apple," observes The Verge, "and Energous - though declining to state its partner's name - is certainly happy to fuel the speculation. Rizzone says the partnership is with 'one of the largest consumer electronic companies in the world. I cannot tell you who it is, but I can virtual guarantee that you have products from this company on your person, sitting on your desk, or at home.'" Separate wireless charging accessory In November 2016, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicted in one of his Apple Insight research notes that Apple will bring wireless charging capabilities to the autumn 2017 iPhone handsets, thanks to the all-glass design, but warned that the firm may bundle the wireless charger with more expensive models only. The firm envisions a wireless pad for charging the phones, somewhat like the inductive charger that comes with the Apple Watch. Business Insider offers slightly more detail of Ming-Chi Kuo's predictions, clarifying that Pegatron is expected to be "the exclusive supplier of the wireless charger". In February 2017 a report by Macotakara also predicted that wireless charging will require a separate accessory. "Information from Taiwan which we have confidence in... [is] saying that the model which uses glass on the back will be able to support wireless charging," the site reports. "Although it can support wireless charging, the same equipment for wireless charging as the Galaxy, which can support wireless charging, is not included in the package, and LUXSHARE-ICT is a separately manufactured accessory." Perhaps the iPhone 8 Plus will offer wireless charging out of the box, while iPhone 8 buyers will need to purchase the charging pad separately (in this scenario, obviously the phones would need to be chargeable via conventional means too); or it might be the lower storage capacity units that miss out on the bundled wireless charger. That's another accessory to put on your shopping list, then. Improved 3D Touch 3D Touch was introduced to the iPhone 6S in 2015, but we're hoping it'll get a lot better for the iPhone 8. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo suggests that Apple is working on just that. According to Kuo, Apple is improving 3D Touch with new technology that should make it more sensitive and potentially capable of more complicated gestures. Face-detection and iris-recognition In December 2014, USPTO awarded Apple a patent relating to a "personal computing device control using face detection and recognition". Current iPhones and iPads can be unlocked using just your fingerprint, thanks to the Touch ID sensor. But with this patent, future iPhones and other devices could be unlocked using facial recognition: effectively, your face becomes your password. More recently, DigiTimes has predicted - citing that old favourite, "industry sources" - that Apple is likely to launch iPhones equipped with iris-recognition technology in 2018, which should line up with the iPhone 8's launch. This rumour was reiterated at the end of August 2016 when DigiTimes reported that Taiwan-based Xintec is expected to provide iris scanners to Apple for the iPhone launching in 2017, and that this would help boost the company's revenues significantly next year. DigiTimes returned to the subject in February 2017 with further claims about iris scanning based on industry sources. Also in February, JPMorgan analyst Rod Hall backed up this theory with his own prediction that the iPhone 8 will have a 3D laser scanner for face recognition, replacing Touch ID. (Working on the current widespread belief that there will be three new iPhones in autumn 2017, Hall says the iPhone 8 will definitely get the scanner, while the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus may or may not.) Hall expects the scanner to add between $10 and $15 to the production costs per unit. Once this technology becomes widespread - and you should expect other firms to launch phones with the feature before Apple, with DigiTimes predicting that Samsung for one will get there in the second half of 2016 - you'll be able to unlock your iPhone by scanning your eye. Is that really more convenient than scanning a fingerprint, though? It's more excitingly futuristic, admittedly. Augmented reality and VR In the Facebook post by Robert Scoble we mentioned earlier, one of the more surprising and detailed predictions concerns augmented reality and VR. "Really amazing VR/AR/mixed reality is coming to a phone, and coming by the end of 2017," Scoble writes. "Apple's entrance into this new world is like when IBM came into the personal computing world. It is that important." He discusses the impact that a mixed-reality iPhone could have on the market, and predicts: "You'll look through the glass in mixed reality modes (think of a new kind of Pokemon game) either in the headset, or in your hand. Apple's purchase of Metaio is going to prove very key. I won't be shocked to learn that Peter Meier, CTO there, is in charge of the next iPhone strategy and has been for years." Scoble isn't the only pundit predicting that Apple - and the iPhone in particular - are about to plunge into the world of augmented reality. Business Insider claims that the company is already working on ways to integrate AR elements into the iPhone's Camera app. "By adding AR technology into the iPhone's camera software, Apple wants consumers to be able to point the phone at a real-world object and have it be recognised, according to Kris Kolo, director of the VR/AR Association and a board member of Flyby Media, an AR startup that was acquired by Apple earlier this year," writes the site. Business Insider further predicts that the iPhone's camera app will be able to recognise "and manipulate" faces in augmented reality. And we've spotted a recent Apple patent application that appears to back up all this speculation. Patent 9,488,488, for 'Augmented reality maps', describes the use of a mobile device to view live video of whatever is in front of the user, and to then superimpose images related to nearby places of interest on top of the video. "A user points a handheld communication device to capture and display a real-time video stream. The handheld communication device detects geographic position, camera direction, and tilt of the image capture device. The user sends a search request to a server for nearby points of interest. ... The handheld communication device visually augments the captured video stream with data related to each point of interest. The user then selects a point of interest to visit. The handheld communication device visually augments the captured video stream with a directional map to a selected point of interest in response to the user input." Numerous Wall Street analyst firms have dissected the state of augmented reality technology and the likely nature and impact of a mooted 3D camera/scanner appearing in the late-2017 iPhone. Stephen Milunovich of UBS strikes an optimistic note, predicting that "investors could be surprised at how AR could reinvigorate the iPhone/iPad and possibly result in new products" and citing Apple's hardware expertise and large coherent user base as reasons why it can make AR work. Morgan Stanley's researchers are less convinced, raising doubts over widespread consumer appeal (noting the rapid drop-off in interest seen even by Pokemon Go) and questioning whether smartphones will have sufficient processing power. And KGI's Ming Chi Kuo thinks developing successful AR applications will enable Apple to redefine currently popular products such as the iPhone, boost comparatively low-takeup products such as the Apple Watch and move into new areas such as car tech. For more detail on analysts' take on the mooted iPhone 3D scanner, we recommend Business Insider's comprehensive review of the material. Read more: Apple VR and augmented reality rumours What tech specs will the iPhone 8 get? It's hard to predict precise specs this far in advance, but it's possible to draw some broad conclusions about where Apple is headed. Let's start with... Screen resolution A report by the Wall Street Journal prophesies that Apple has big things up its sleeve for the next iPhone's screen, after turning out smartphones with lower resolutions than their rivals for some years. (If you compare the iPhone 7 and Samsung Galaxy S7, for example, you'll see that Apple managed only a 760 x 1334 resolution on its 4.7-inch screen, in comparison to the 1440 x 2560 5.1-inch screen that Samsung had to offer. Comparison possibly isn't the right word to use when the difference is as pronounced as that.) The iPhone 8 will sit in Samsung's shadows no longer, according to the WSJ, which says Apple has asked suppliers to "submit prototype screens with better resolution than ones from Samsung". If this is true - and if the suppliers are able to match Apple's stipulation without pushing up price, weight or dimension, or reducing battery life or fire safety, to a degree that Apple finds unacceptable - then this would imply more than a tripling of the pixel count from one iPhone generation to the next. In February 2017 Ming Chi Kuo predicted that the (5.15in) iPhone 8 will have a resolution of 2,436 x 1,125 and a pixel density of 521ppi, far higher than the iPhone 7's 326ppi. And the 5.8in version of the iPhone 8 - the iPhone 8 Plus, presumably - will have a resolution of 2,800 x 1,242 and a pixel density of 528ppi. Screen size What's more, word is that screens are getting bigger in 2017. In November 2016, Barclays Research - via MacRumors - released a report predicting that the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus would have 5-inch and 5.8-inch screens respectively, compared to the 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. The analysts based the prediction on the testimony of sources within Apple's Asian supply chain. It's still early days, though: the analysts warned that the design "didn't sound 100% locked down", so Apple may yet change its mind. In January 2017 this theory was backed up by a source in Asia. DigiTimes predicts that Apple will launch a 5.8-inch iPhone in the second half of 2017, citing anonymous sources in the Taiwanese supply chain. "Apple will launch 4.7-, 5.5- and 5.8-inch new iPhone models in the second half of 2017," the site writes, "with TFT-LCD panels to be used in the former two models and AMOLED for the 5.8-inch one." There remains some confusion, however, about whether that 5.8-inch measurement will take into account the extra space provided by the screen's predicted curved edges. Indeed, it's possible that this 5.8-inch phone's chassis will be the same size as that of current Plus models, gaining 0.3 inches of diagonal screen size through the curved edges and the lack of bottom bezel and Home button. Further weight has been added to the theory that one of the new iPhone models to be unveiled this autumn will have a bigger screen than ever before: a whopping 5.8 inches, if a report from Nikkei is to be believed. "The upcoming iPhone, to be launched this [autumn], will come in three configurations - two with liquid crystal displays and one with a 5.8-inch organic light-emitting diode display," the site predicts. If you're wondering how Apple will fit in that extra screen real estate - will the phones be bulkier than the current handsets? - then fear not. It's understood that the larger screens will fit in bodies with the same dimensions as the current generation of phones, thanks to a bezel-free design. This has been on the cards for a while. On 5 March 2015, indeed, Apple filed a patent that would allow for a bezel-free device. Similarly, according to a Wall Street Journal source, the iPhone 8 may feature an edgeless display - but what is that, exactly? According to the publication, Apple is to redesign the iPhone for the 10th anniversary and that the changes "could include an edge-to-edge organic light-emitting diode, or OLED, screen" without a physical Home button. John Gruber also commented on the upcoming redesign, claiming that Apple is to remove the bezels surrounding the display, providing users with an iPhone that looks almost like a sheet of glass. If Apple kills off the bezel, it will need to find a new place to put the Home button. On which topic, it's believed that Apple is investigating including the fingerprint scanner into the display of a smartphone or tablet. In fact, Apple filed a patent describing a Touch ID display back in January 2013.  This technology means that you could place your finger on the display to scan it, instead of the Home Button. We're not sure if this technology was an original variation to the Home Button scanner found on the iPhone 5s, or if it'll be combined with the Haptics & Tactile technology to remove the Home Button on a future iPhone and replace it with a virtual onscreen button. The Barclays Research report we mentioned earlier also predicts that the iPhone 8 will have a curved screen. This broadly fits in with earlier predictions. Some while back Nikkei predicted that autumn 2017 will see a massive triple iPhone launch, and that the flagship model of this trio will feature a curved OLED screen that curves down over the sides. This is something we've already seen on rival devices, such as Samsung's S7 Edge and Note 7; it enables more screen space to be squeezed on to a device without making it any bigger, and you can also have notifications designed to be seen or activated on the edge of the screen. "There will be a 4.7-inch model, another that will be 5.5-inches and a premium handset that will be either 5.5-inches or larger equipped with a screen bent on the two sides," said Nikkei's source, who was said to be "familiar with Apple's plans". A company named Applied Materials, which already works with Apple, has dropped strong hints about ramping display demand from the company heading towards 2017, and this has been taken as evidence for the iPhone 8 incorporating an OLED screen. "Applied Materials reported an almost fourfold leap in orders for equipment to make displays, an early sign producers are retooling their manufacturing to meet Apple's demand for a new kind of organic light-emitting diode, or OLED, screen," reports Bloomberg. This appeared to be confirmed on 29 October 2016 by Tai Jeng-wu, the president of Sharp, which makes smartphone displays for Apple. Tai, who was speaking to students at his old university, said: "The iPhone has been evolving and now it is switching from LTPS [low-temperature poly-silicon] to OLED panels. We don't know whether Apple's OLED iPhones will be a hit, but if Apple doesn't walk down this path and transform itself, there will be no innovation. It is a crisis but it is also an opportunity." The OLED iPhone rumour has been knocking around for a while; in December 2015 it was predicted that OLED would come to the iPhone line in 2018 as a result of a partnership between Apple and Japan Display. Talking of Japan Display... that company uses a new technology that it calls "full active LCD", and some pundits believe that only one of the new iPhones next year will get OLED, while the other(s) have screens based on full-active LCD. The technology, which Japan Display describes as using "a new high-density wiring layout and new processing and module assembly technologies" is capable of making the bottom bezel of an iPhone "as narrow as the other three sides". Japan Display aims to start mass production by the end of March, 2017, according to Fool.com - in time for the iPhone 8 launch, then. Processor As everyone knows, the iPhones contain proprietary processor chips that you won't find in other smartphones: there's an A9 in the iPhone 6s, and we should get an A10 chip in the iPhone 7, for example. But while these are made to Apple's own design and specifications, several other companies are involved: they contain technology licensed from ARM, and are manufactured, at present, by Samsung and TSMC. But that could change by the time 2018 comes around. Intel has declared its intention of expanding its smartphone business, and is hot favourite to displace TSMC from the iPhone contract, according to the Nikkei Asian Review - an aim that may be more feasible thanks to the company's recently announced partnership with ARM. TSMC's ties with ARM have given it a competitive edge when it comes to securing the contract in the past. "Intel is definitely the most formidable challenger for TSMC," said an anonymous chip-industry executive. "There is no rivalry between Apple and Intel so it's really likely that Apple could shift some orders there. The move is also in line with Washington's policy to encourage US companies to make more products at home." RAM The iPhone 7 comes with 2GB RAM, while the iPhone 7 Plus offers 3GB. In February 2017 research firm TrendForce published a report predicting that the iPhone 8 (we assume they mean all models) will have 3GB RAM, which should provide a speed boost for the smaller-screen models. Storage The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus both comes in three storage configurations: 32GB, 198GB and 256GB. (The older iPhone 6s and 6s Plus are available with 32GB and 128GB only, whereas the iPhone SE offers 16GB or 64GB.) The TrendForce report linked above suggests that Apple may phase out the 32GB model for the iPhone 8 generation. The late-2017 iPhones will come in 64GB and 256GB configurations, the firm says. Camera The iPhone is one of the most widely used cameras in the world. What's in store for this vital element of the iPhone of the future? Lucky iPhone owners of the future may get their hands on a feature currently offered only by premium video cameras. In March 2015 Apple was granted a patent for a "digital camera with light splitter". Its project is to create a light splitter system (which for now exists only in high-end video camera) small enough to fit in an iPhone. In essence, a light splitter system consists of a cube that splits received light into three colours: red, green and blue. The cube provides three image sensors, each of which receives one colour component. In recent iPhones, the camera system is such that its pixels capture the three component colours which end up occupying only a single image sensor; this means that they can fill only one third of the image sensor and colours are not as accurate as they could be. The light splitter system would be a big coup for Apple. Its iPhone would be able to capture high-quality pictures with more precise colours, especially at night. Apple seems to be keen to improve the camera capabilities of its iOS devices, and one patent published by USPTO in May 2014 suggests we could soon see iPhones that are able to capture "Super-resolution" photos thanks to optical image stabilisation, which is already a feature of the iPhone 6 Plus. The patent describes a system that takes a series of photographs at slightly different angles and stitches them together to create a 'super resolution' photograph. Apple doesn't suggest a device would capture every photo this way. Instead, the user would have the option to turn super-resolution mode on, much like HDR and Panorama modes. Several rumours suggest that Apple plans to introduce a feature like this with an iPhone in the near future, with reports pointing to a 'DSLR-quality' capability that would represent the biggest camera jump in iPhone upgrade history. Finally, and related to the face-recognition tech we discussed earlier, Ming Chi Kuo thinks the anticipated front-facing 3D camera on the iPhone 8 will enable developers to come up with innovative new games and allow users to take 3D selfies. Battery Ming Chi Kuo has predicted that the iPhone 8 will squeeze a battery with a capacity to match the iPhone 7 Plus - 2,700mAH - into a chassis comparable to the iPhone 7. So we could see a significant battery life increase in the next generation of iPhones. Another rumour holds that Apple will take the battery developments it deployed in the 12-inch MacBook - whereby contoured, layered battery units are stacked inside the chassis in order to take up every possible inch of space - and use these to squeeze more battery volume inside the iPhone. (According to Wired's write-up, Apple actually claims to adjust its battery contours on a machine-by-machine basis, by photographing the inside of the chassis and modifying the battery stack to fit all the tiny imperfections - which, if it's true, is amazing.) Smartphone battery life is one of those things that everyone says is important, and once again Apple will hear many requests for improved battery life in the iPhone 8 - but you do wonder how much of a compromise the average Apple fan would be willing to make in return. What if, in order to achieve a superb battery life, the iPhone 8 was twice the weight, or cost significantly more? What if the screen was less powerful or the processor scaled back? Mirroring these thoughts somewhat, Jony Ive discussed battery life briefly in an interview with the Financial Times' 'How to spend it' supplement. And he gave fairly heavy hints that Apple doesn't think battery life is a high enough priority to make compromises in other areas worth it. "Talking of performance, when the issue of the frequent need to recharge the iPhone is raised, [Ive] answers that it's because it's so light and thin that we use it so much and therefore deplete the battery. With a bigger battery it would be heavier, more cumbersome, less 'compelling'." Apple is clearly aware that battery life is a concern for a lot of its customers, but battery life remains a question of compromises, such that increasing it always necessitates either making a device thicker, heavier or more expensive, or choosing not to make it thinner, lighter or cheaper when you could have done. I still believe that most people would rather have a thin, relatively cheap iPhone than a fat, more expensive iPhone with an extra two hours of battery life. And since the launch of the battery pack case, anyone who would be willing to make that compromise now has an officially sanctioned alternative: spend the extra money, make your phone fatter and uglier, and get the battery pack. LiFi A boring but important rumour about the iPhone 8's specs relates to LiFi, a new wireless standard that boasts 100x faster download speeds than conventional WiFi connections. LiFi uses visible light communication (VLC) instead of radio waves like conventional WiFi routers. Intrigued? Find out more about LiFi in our complete guide over at PC Advisor. How much will the iPhone 8 cost in the UK? Here are the prices of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus; it's likely that the iPhone 8 will be priced at a similar point. iPhone 7 (32GB): £599 iPhone 7 (128GB): £699 iPhone 7 (256GB): £799 iPhone 7 Plus (32GB): £719 iPhone 7 Plus (128GB): £819 iPhone 7 Plus (256GB): £919 However, there's an alternative theory - that the iPhone 8 (or iPhone X) will break the thousand-dollar barrier in the US for the first time (this is according to Fast Company, citing a source "with knowledge of Apple's plans"), which is likely to translate to a UK price of £940 or so. For comparison, in the US the 128GB cellular-equipped edition of the 12.9-inch iPad Pro costs $1,029; in the UK this model costs £939. The iPhone 7 Plus with 256GB of storage costs £919, or $969 in the US. Leaked images and videos of the iPhone 8 This is where we'll post leaked photos and video of the iPhone 8 and its components that we are able to dig up, as well as concept illustrations created by designers who are not affiliated with Apple. Mockup illustrations with function area, curved edge screen These image were created by AlHasan Husni. You can see how much more screen space would be opened up if Apple removed the side bezels and reduced the size of the top and bottom bezels; the screen, in fact, extends over the curved edges of the side of the device. Husni has also included the rumoured 'function area' along the bottom of the screen, taking the place of the current Home button: Function area used with augmented reality Talking of function areas, take a look at these stunning mockups by Gabor Balogh, which focus on that particular anticipated new design feature, and how it will interact with the also-rumoured new augmented reality features. 'This is 8' concept Here's a lovely iPhone 8 concept - together with some fairly detailed specs - by Handy Abo Vergleich. Concept images & video of edge-to-edge screen With rumours of an edge-to-edge display proving popular, designer Thadeu Brandao got to work on a new concept for the iPhone 8.  Coined as "the next big step" in iPhone design, Brandao's renders look stunning, with the iPhone 8 sporting a nearly bezel-less display and an embedded Home button alongside a completely redesigned iOS 11. Of course, Brandao has no affiliation with Apple and the next iPhone might not look like this but hey, it's nice to imagine, right? Brandao's lovely concepts have been made into a video - an 'iPhone 8 commercial' - and posted on the YouTube channel ConceptsiPhone: Concept images of new colour options Designer Martin Hajek has published some gorgeous concept images of a Deep Blue colour option for the next iPhone. See more over on Martin's website. Leaked photo of iPhone with Smart Connector According to a report and alleged leak from Mac Otakara, a forthcoming iPhone will feature a smart connector. Mac Otakara claims "the possibility is great" that earlier leaked images are "the real thing", and even went on to claim that the next iPhone could be as thin as 6.1mm, although there was no source provided for this information. Bezel-free iPhone An image render and concept by Marek Weidlich shows us what the iPhone might look like if it were to have no bezels. The conceptual idea looks great and would show that Apple is still innovating in the smartphone space. Macworld poll - What do you want from your future iPhone? It's your turn.

Build Apps 5x Faster For Half the Cost Enterprise Cloud Computing On Force.com What the CIA WikiLeaks Dump Tells Us: Encryption Works By Anick Jesdanun and Michael Liedtke PUBLISHED: MARCH 15 2017 If the tech industry is drawing one lesson from the latest WikiLeaks disclosures, it's that data-scrambling encryption works, and the industry should use more of it. Documents purportedly outlining a massive CIA surveillance program suggest that CIA agents must go to great lengths to circumvent encryption they can't break. In many cases, physical presence is required to carry off these targeted attacks. "We are in a world where if the U.S. government wants to get your data, they can't hope to break the encryption," said Nicholas Weaver, who teaches networking and security at the University of California, Berkeley. "They have to resort to targeted attacks, and that is costly, risky and the kind of thing you do only on targets you care about. Seeing the CIA have to do stuff like this should reassure civil libertarians that the situation is better now than it was four years ago." More Encryption Four years ago is when former NSA contractor Edward Snowden revealed details of huge and secret U.S. eavesdropping programs. To help thwart spies and snoops, the tech industry began to protectively encrypt email and messaging apps, a process that turns their contents into indecipherable gibberish without the coded "keys" that can unscramble them. The NSA revelations shattered earlier assumptions that internet data was nearly impossible to intercept for meaningful surveillance, said Joseph Lorenzo Hall, chief technologist at the Washington-based civil-liberties group Center for Democracy & Technology. That was because any given internet message gets split into a multitude of tiny "packets," each of which traces its own unpredictable route across the network to its destination. The realization that spy agencies had figured out that problem spurred efforts to better shield data as it transits the internet. A few services such as Facebook's WhatsApp followed the earlier example of Apple's iMessage and took the extra step of encrypting data in ways even the companies couldn't unscramble, a method called end-to-end encryption. Challenges for Authorities In the past, spy agencies like the CIA could have hacked servers at WhatsApp or similar services to see what people were saying. End-to-end encryption, though, makes that prohibitively difficult. So the CIA has to resort to tapping individual phones and intercepting data before it is encrypted or after it's decoded. It's much like the old days when "they would have broken into a house to plant a microphone," said Steven Bellovin, a Columbia University professor who has long studied cybersecurity issues. Cindy Cohn, executive director for Electronic Frontier Foundation, a group focused on online privacy, likened the CIA's approach to "fishing with a line and pole rather than fishing with a driftnet." Encryption has grown so strong that even the FBI had to seek Apple's help last year in cracking the locked iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino attackers. Apple resisted what it considered an intrusive request, and the FBI ultimately broke into the phone by turning to an unidentified party for a hacking tool --" presumably one similar to those the CIA allegedly had at its disposal. On Wednesday, FBI Director James Comey acknowledged the challenges posed by encryption. He said there should be a balance between privacy and the FBI's ability to lawfully access information. He also said the FBI needs to recruit talented computer personnel who might otherwise go to work for Apple or Google. Government officials have long wanted to force tech companies to build "back doors" into encrypted devices, so that the companies can help law enforcement descramble messages with a warrant. But security experts warn that doing so would undermine security and privacy for everyone. As Apple CEO Tim Cook pointed out last year, a back door for good guys can also be a back door for bad guys. So far, efforts to pass such a mandate have stalled. Still a Patchwork At the moment, though, end-to-end encrypted services such as iMessage and WhatsApp are still the exception. While encryption is far more widely used than it was in 2013, many messaging companies encode user data in ways that let them read or scan it. Authorities can force these companies to divulge message contents with warrants or other legal orders. With end-to-end encryption, the companies wouldn't even have the keys to do so. Further expanding the use of end-to-end encryption presents some challenges. That's partly because encryption will make it more difficult to perform popular tasks such as searching years of emails for mentions of a specific keyword. Google announced in mid-2014 that it was working on end-to-end encryption for email, but the tools have yet to materialize beyond research environments. Instead, Google's Gmail encrypts messages in transit. But even that isn't possible unless it's adopted by the recipient's mail system as well. And encryption isn't a panacea, as the WikiLeaks disclosures suggest. According to the purported CIA documents, spies have found ways to exploit holes in phone and computer software to grab messages when they haven't been encrypted yet. Although Apple, Google and Microsoft say they have fixed many of the vulnerabilities alluded to in the CIA documents, it's not known how many holes remain open. "There are different levels where attacks take place, said Daniel Castro, vice president with the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. "We may have secured one level (with encryption), but there are other weaknesses out there we should be focused on as well." Cohn said people should still use encryption, even with these bypass techniques. "It's better than nothing," she said. "The answer to the fact that your front door might be cracked open isn't to open all your windows and walk around naked, too." © 2017 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

Cybercrime Network Raids in Europe Next Article > Arm Your Business Against Social Media 'Brandjacking' By Ann Marie van den Hurk PUBLISHED: MARCH 15 2017 The use of social media can give small businesses a big boost. But social channels can also be minefields of trouble. Potential headaches include fraudsters falsely assuming your or your business's identity -- what's called "brandjacking" -- with the intent of ruining your reputation or scramming consumers. Brandjacking, unfortunately, is pretty easy to pull off, requiring only a Twitter, Facebook or Instagram account and a desire to inflict damage on a targeted organization. And the issue is getting worse. The number of fake social media profiles created for fraudulent purposes increased 1,100 percent from 2014 to 2016, according to new research by social media security firm ZeroFOX. Meanwhile, research from ProofPoint, a cybersecurity company, suggests social media phishing attacks have become disturbingly common. More specifically, the firm has seen a rise in what are called "angler phishing” attacks, in which a fake customer support account is set up to lure consumers into giving out their personal information. Other scams include verification phishing, in which troublemakers impersonate actual social networks by offering users allegedly verified accounts and then asking those users to provide personal information as part of the bogus verification process. There's also ad phishing, in which the fraudsters set up fake corporate accounts on their made-up social networks, making them look more legitimate and proliferating their scam. These traps are well developed, and the con artists, to make things seem more realistic, will participate in online discussions and back-and-forth tweets before directing users to other, less-public channels like email and direct messaging. You should also look out for malicious URLs embedded in social media posts, which can direct users to malware or credential-harvesting sites. And while the big social networks all have established policies and protections in place to combat fraud, given their millions of users, the platforms can't be fully policed. All of this creates a tricky environment for brands. But there are at least two good ways to prevent your brand from being hijacked and used for ill gains: Officially register your business on every social media platform, including new ones, even if you aren't planning to be active on them. Use monitoring tools to not just keep track of customer service needs, but also dodgy activity. Awareness can help you battle these scammers and keep them from damaging your business and the trust of your customers. © 2017 Valley News under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

provided by Research and Markets Mar 15, 2017, 12:15 ET Share this article DUBLIN, Mar. 15, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Research and Markets has announced the addition of the "Fan-Out Wafer Level Packaging Patent Landscape" report to their offering. With Apple and its A10 processor employing TSMC's InFO-PoP technology, the fan-out market has exploded. Apple's involvement will undoubtedly generate increased interest in the fanout platform, and market revenue is forecast to reach around US$2.5B in 2021, with 80% growth between 2015 - 2017. Moreover, following the high-volume adoption of InFO and the further development of fan-out wafer level packaging technologies, a wave of new players may enter the market. The supply chain is also expected to evolve, with a considerable amount of investment in Fan-Out packaging capabilities. In such a fast-growing Fan-Out market, it is essential to deeply understand the global patent landscape in order to anticipate changes, harvest business opportunities, mitigate risks, and make strategic decisions in order to strengthen one's market position and maximize return on one's IP portfolio. The report thoroughly investigates the Fan-Out packaging patent landscape (chip-first, chip-last, face-down, face-up, single-die, multi-chip module, package-on-package, system-inpackage, etc.), and this report contains detailed patent analyses including countries of filing, patents' legal status, and patented technologies, as well as patent owners, their IP position, and IP strategies. More than 3,100 patents relating to over 1,200 inventions on Fan-Out packaging have been published worldwide through September 2016, coming from 100+ patent applicants. A first wave of patent applications occurred from 1999-2006, induced by Infineon. Patent applications have increased since then, with Freescale (NXP), STATS ChipPAC (JCET), SPIL, Amkor, and TSMC entering the Fan-Out IP arena. Today the number of enforceable patents is increasing worldwide, with several companies already standing out by virtue of their strong IP position. All of major players involved has filed patents on Fan-Out packaging, except for Nanium, which does not file any patents at all but instead has adopted a different IP strategy that we discuss in this report. Another special case is the presence of patent licensing companies like Polaris Innovations (WiLAN), which in 2015 acquired key patents from Infineon/Qimonda. The visibility of such companies in the patent landscape is a tangible sign of the market explodes. In the next few years Polaris Innovations could assert its patents to make money, and in this report we present its most critical patents. We have also noted Samsung's conspicuous IP presence in the FOWLP patent landscape, despite the company's unclear market position. R&D labs are also present (i.e. Fraunhofer, A - STAR, CEA), but to a lesser extent. Most new entrants in the FOWLP patent landscape are Chinese players (HuaTian Technology, NCAP, SMIC), and more recently we have observed Apple's appearance. Apple, which this year chose TSMC's InFO-PoP technology for its A10 APE, has recently filed some patents on Fan-Out wafer level packaging (chip-last, chip-first, PoP, and SiP), reflecting a genuine interest in the FOWLP platform. Key Features Of The Report: - IP trends, including time evolutions and countries of patent filings - Patents' current legal status - Ranking of main patent applicants - IP collaboration, joint development, and licensing agreements - Key players' IP position, and relative strength of their patent portfolios - Patent segmentation by technology solution (chip-first, chip-last, facedown, face-up), process steps (die placement, molding, planarization, RDL), architecture (multi-chip, PoP, SiP, face-to-face package), and technical challenge (warpage, die shift) - Matrix showing patent applicants and their patented technologies - Technical solutions found in patents for warpage and die-shift issues.  - FOWLP IP profiles for 18 key companies, including countries of filing, patents' legal status, patented technologies, prior art strength index, IP blocking potential, partnerships, and IP strategy - Excel database with all patents (3,100+) analyzed in this report, including technology segmentation.

Maureen Ohlhausen, the commission's sole Republican and its acting chair under Trump, said the FTC was primarily a law enforcement agency and called for wait-and-see approach to enforcement during a discussion at a conference of cybersecurity professionals on Monday at the Nasdaq. She also defended the use of big data to offer consumers different prices for the same good and said she wanted manufacturers of internet-connected household devices to decide best practices among themselves. Ohlhausen defended the airline and hotel industry practice of altering prices for some services based on consumer data in conversation with the Guardian, saying that such practices spurred competition. "Information can be used to target some consumers with a higher price, but the same information can be used to target some consumers with a better deal," Ohlhausen said. She recommended a voluntary set of standards suggested by an industry trade association called the broadband internet technology advisory group (Bitag). Many technologists have called for industry standardization in Internet of Things (IoT) devices in the wake of the hack on internet backbone provider Dyn late in 2016, which was widely attributed to a single Chinese manufacturer of low-security webcams. Asked whether there should be mandatory regulations rather than suggestions from industry groups, Ohlhausen said, "We haven't taken a position." "We're saying not 'Let's speculate about harm five years out,' but 'Is there something happening that harms consumers right now or is likely to cause harm to consumers,'" Ohlhausen told the audience at the conference. If there is potential harm to consumers in a new technology, the FTC should not act until that harm manifests, she said: "We don't know if that risk will materialize. It may well materialize, but a solution may materialize at the same time." While it is true that the FTC has not passed regulations of its own since the contact lens rule in 2004, it has often proposed that Congress pass legislation that would affect domestic trade. In 1975, Congress gave the FTC the authority to adopt industry-wide trade regulation rules; other commissioners have referred to themselves as regulators. "We do have a few regulations and we're looking to see if any need to be streamlined,” she said with respect to the Trump administration's one-in,-two-out rule. © 2017 Guardian Web under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

ETF News Best ETFs Top Rated ETFs Best ETF Categories ETF Screener Tools ETF Screener Find Whats In Your ETF Find What ETFs Hold Your Stock Find ETFs By Leverage Find ETFs By Asset Class Free Newsletter Search Report: iPhone 8 To Feature Curved Samsung OLED Screens March 15, 2017 11:00am Nasdaq:AAPL ShareTweet From Tyler Durden: Days after Apple stock briefly jumped following reports it may announce new products as soon as next week – most likely involving an update to the company’s iPad line – the new product fever returned when moments ago Japan’s Nikkei reported that the most expensive iPhone 8 handsets will feature curved screens based on organic light-emitting diode (OLED) technology, to be solely provided by Samsung Electronics. The curve will reportedly be “gentler” than screens in Samsung’s Galaxy S7 Edge handsets, the Nikkei source reports. This is partly due to the challenges of making curved glass covers to match screens, according to the source. While the curved screen will allow a viewable area of about 5.2 inches and make the iPhone even sleeker, it will not offer significant new functions, the person said. Hardly new, curved OLED screens on smartphones were pioneered by Samsung, and Chinese companies including Vivo and Huawei have also released high-end handsets with the feature. Smartphone makers have pounced on the new display as they seek to differentiate their designs from a plethora of Android phones available in the saturated global market. Compared with current mainstream liquid crystal display technology adopted by most smartphones, OLED panels offer sharper color contrast. Perhaps in an indication that it is running out of groundbreaking ideas, Apple is a latecomer to the scene, and like the others, are not thought to be able to offer any game-changing functions with the curved screens. Some reports suggest that Apple will only give the premium handset a flat display, but the source said that would not be using OLED optimally. Recently analysts have denied curve speculation: “We anticipate Apple will adopt a flat implementation of OLED design on their special iPhone model, which is analogous to the current 2.5D glass design,” IHS Markit analyst Wayne Lam told MacRumors last week. “Much like the recently announced LG G6, we anticipate a touchscreen with a new longer aspect ratio design to take advantage of higher coverage area of the iPhone in its entirety,” he added. “This new design language is expected to become the trend for 2017, as we all anticipate Samsung’s reveal later this month.” KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has also dismissed the curved-screen rumors. He said he expected Apple’s next flagship iPhone to have a screen similar to those of previous iPhone models, with very slightly curved edges. The Chinese research company TrendForce said the same. As a reminder, Samsung also offers both curve and flat versions of its premium phones. Still, according to Nikkei, the design has not been finalized and could still change. China’s Biel Crystal and Lens Technology will supply the glass backs for the new handsets and, together with key iPhone assembler Hon Hai Precision Industry, will provide the front glass covers, the person said. Together with the OLED iPhone, Apple is expected to release two other lower-priced handsets with flat screens that measure 4.7 inches and 5.5 inches, as part of its 10th anniversary range later this year. The coming Samsung Galaxy S8 device is also expected to have a longer OLED display with slim bezels and no physical home button after leaked photos revealed what the device might look like, Business Insider reported. Speaking with MacRumors, Raymond Soneira of DisplayMate said he did not have any inside information on the iPhone 8, but he did say that OLED displays made out of a glass substrate were cheaper and “available in much higher production volumes” than curved OLED displays that rely on a flexible plastic substrate. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) was trading at $139.30 per share on Wednesday morning, up $0.31 (+0.22%). Year-to-date, AAPL has gained 20.27%, versus a 6.34% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period. This article is brought to you courtesy of ZeroHedge.

Apple has four existing stores in the Miami area, but this will be the first to be located in the city's thriving downtown core. Apple Brickell City Centre will be one of three Apple retail stores to open on that day alongside new locations at Schildergasse in Cologne, Germany and Jinmao Place in Nanjing, China, which also open at 10:00 a.m. local time respectively. All three are brand new stores, not renovated or relocated ones. Brickell City Centre is a new shopping and mixed-use development in Miami's financial district. Apple's plans to open a retail store there were revealed in February 2016, and construction began shortly afterwards. The location is expected to be one of Apple's largest retail stores in Florida. Apple continues to renovate and expand a number of its stores across the United States with a new design introduced in 2015, including its relocated St. Johns Town Center store that opened March 11 in Jacksonville, Florida. Apple's Woodland Mall store in Grand Rapids, Michigan is next on the docket. The newer look often includes wider open spaces with some combination of large glass doors, touch-sensitive sequoia wood tables and shelves, seating areas for community events, large 6K resolution video screens for product marketing, indoor trees, and light boxes extending the length of the ceiling. Elsewhere in the United States, Apple's expanded Pentagon City store in the Washington D.C. area reopened on March 4, while its Danbury, Connecticut store location closed for renovations in early February.

EDIT: Heh, I Just realized I answered my own question earlier. Of course Apple wants to open more stores here if it means getting more of that hard tourist currency. But still, so many smaller cities could use an Apple Store. Of course miami needs another store. Lincoln road is always bursting at the seems with tourists and locals alike. It's a tiny store. And a 10 minute drive is somewhat optimistic once you factor in humungous traffic over Biscayne bridge and downtown as well as parking.

There have been rumors about Apple pushing forward production of the edge-to-edge 10.5-inch iPad but an absence of online leaks. An update to the 12.9-inch iPad Pro is also expected but the timeline is unclear. Today, Macotakara is posing the idea that a new 9.7-inch iPad Pro 2, with the first version released almost a year ago, could be the first new Apple product of the year. It is reportedly a minor, iterative, update over the current iPad Pro with no external design changes. The best, strongest, Lightning cables ... buy braided cables here Apple analyst KGI has also spoken of a new lower-cost 9.7 inch iPad. An analytics firm has found references to four new iPad identifiers, suggesting the products are about a month away from formal release. According to the Japanese blog, the 9.7-inch iPad Pro 2 will include an A10X chip to boast better CPU and graphics performance, however. This would certainly follow the trend of Apple releasing iPads with an ‘X’ version of the iPhone chip; as the iPhone 7 includes an A10 Fusion chip, it follows that the new iPads would include an A10X. Last generation, Apple released the iPhone 6s with an A9 SoC followed by the iPad Pro with an A9X. As an iterative update, it also makes sense that this could be going downmarket. Keeping the same general design allows Apple to cost-save and exploit economies of scale. Not changing the design also means the Smart Keyboard and Apple Pencil accessories should continue to work as is, without needing to be redesigned or updated. As a smaller-scale hardware announcement, it would also be perfectly suited to announce via an Apple press release, potentially sometime next week, rather than requiring the ceremony of a full Apple event — which many are expecting but is yet to be announced.

With Apple and its A10 processor employing TSMC's InFO-PoP technology, the fan-out market has exploded. Apple's involvement will undoubtedly generate increased interest in the fanout platform, and market revenue is forecast to reach around US$2.5B in 2021, with 80% growth between 2015 - 2017. Moreover, following the high-volume adoption of InFO and the further development of fan-out wafer level packaging technologies, a wave of new players may enter the market. The supply chain is also expected to evolve, with a considerable amount of investment in Fan-Out packaging capabilities. In such a fast-growing Fan-Out market, it is essential to deeply understand the global patent landscape in order to anticipate changes, harvest business opportunities, mitigate risks, and make strategic decisions in order to strengthen one's market position and maximize return on one's IP portfolio. The report thoroughly investigates the Fan-Out packaging patent landscape (chip-first, chip-last, face-down, face-up, single-die, multi-chip module, package-on-package, system-inpackage, etc.), and this report contains detailed patent analyses including countries of filing, patents' legal status, and patented technologies, as well as patent owners, their IP position, and IP strategies. More than 3,100 patents relating to over 1,200 inventions on Fan-Out packaging have been published worldwide through September 2016, coming from 100+ patent applicants. A first wave of patent applications occurred from 1999-2006, induced by Infineon. Patent applications have increased since then, with Freescale (NXP), STATS ChipPAC (JCET), SPIL, Amkor, and TSMC entering the Fan-Out IP arena. Today the number of enforceable patents is increasing worldwide, with several companies already standing out by virtue of their strong IP position. All of major players involved has filed patents on Fan-Out packaging, except for Nanium, which does not file any patents at all but instead has adopted a different IP strategy that we discuss in this report. Another special case is the presence of patent licensing companies like Polaris Innovations (WiLAN), which in 2015 acquired key patents from Infineon/Qimonda. The visibility of such companies in the patent landscape is a tangible sign of the market explodes. In the next few years Polaris Innovations could assert its patents to make money, and in this report we present its most critical patents. We have also noted Samsung's conspicuous IP presence in the FOWLP patent landscape, despite the company's unclear market position. R&D labs are also present (i.e. Fraunhofer, A - STAR, CEA), but to a lesser extent. Most new entrants in the FOWLP patent landscape are Chinese players (HuaTian Technology, NCAP, SMIC), and more recently we have observed Apple's appearance. Apple, which this year chose TSMC's InFO-PoP technology for its A10 APE, has recently filed some patents on Fan-Out wafer level packaging (chip-last, chip-first, PoP, and SiP), reflecting a genuine interest in the FOWLP platform. Key Features Of The Report: - IP trends, including time evolutions and countries of patent filings - Patents' current legal status - Ranking of main patent applicants - IP collaboration, joint development, and licensing agreements - Key players' IP position, and relative strength of their patent portfolios - Patent segmentation by technology solution (chip-first, chip-last, facedown, face-up), process steps (die placement, molding, planarization, RDL), architecture (multi-chip, PoP, SiP, face-to-face package), and technical challenge (warpage, die shift) - Matrix showing patent applicants and their patented technologies - Technical solutions found in patents for warpage and die-shift issues.  - FOWLP IP profiles for 18 key companies, including countries of filing, patents' legal status, patented technologies, prior art strength index, IP blocking potential, partnerships, and IP strategy - Excel database with all patents (3,100+) analyzed in this report, including technology segmentation.

International Business Times Toyin Owoseje 1 day ago SHARE SHARE TWEET SHARE EMAIL Check why this pic went viral! Angelina Jolie bans Jon Voight from seeing grandchildren © ROBYN BECK/AFP/Getty Images Taylor Swift After severing ties with Spotify in 2014 and taking on Apple Music over its refusal to pay artists royalties, Taylor Swift has decided that she is tired of the Bad Blood. According to TMZ, the 27-year-old pop star is launching her own streaming service. The celebrity news site reports that the songstress is shaking things up and has filed documents to create a website that will feature "non-downloadable multi-media content in the nature of audio recordings". And that is not all. The songstress is also flexing her entrepreneurial muscles by releasing a line of music products offering fans the chance to get their hands on her guitars and drumsticks. Fans may recall that Swift scored a huge win over Apple Music in 2015 after her threat to withhold her album 1989 lead to the tech giant deciding to reverse its payment policy and agree to compensate artists during the free trial. The company tweeted at the time: tweeting: "#AppleMusic will pay artist for streaming, even during customer's free trial period. We hear you @taylorswift13 and indie artists. Love, Apple" Interestingly, she recently teamed up with Apple Music. The promo showed falling off a treadmill while working out to Drake's Jumpman. Although there were murmurings of a dramatic return to Spotify in November 2016, Spotify's head of music George Ergatoudis told Newsweek: Nothing's guaranteed, admitted that nothing's guaranteed. "It's not a lock-in, but I've got every reason to be very optimistic Taylor Swift will be coming back to Spotify. I'm not saying it's done, but the indications are good, put it like that," he told Newsweek. For now her entire catalogue is still absent from the platform. It would appear that Swift may have taken a leaf out of Jay Z's book. The rapper and music mogul unveiled celebrity-backed subscription-based streaming service Tidal in 2014 after purchasing it for $56m. Sprint recently invested $200m. Although her new project will likely keep her busy for the rest of the year, Ed Sheeran recently revealed she isn't neglecting her music. He told the BBC: "Taylor [Swift] isn't going to be releasing until probably the end of this year—Christmas is the smartest time to release because that's when everyone buys records."

Or Amazon without Jeff Bezos? Oh yes, personality matters, especially in leadership roles. And that’s what clinical psychologist Ron Warren, who developed the LMAP 360 personality assessment tool, sets out to show in this book, drawing from research of over 20,000 leaders. The book begins with the story of two Steves - Jobs and Wozniak, co-founders of Apple. While one is hailed as a visionary leader, the other is thought of as a figurehead founder. “Their personality differences ultimately undermined their partnership …”, writes Warren. It’s an engaging book that proves Drucker’s truism “culture eats strategy for breakfast”. Team work and decision-making are, after all, dependent on personality traits. According to MIT, there are 638 personality traits, but it is 10-15 traits that are associated with effectiveness at work, and Warren sets out to define and detail these, categorising them into teamwork traits, deference traits, dominance traits and task-mastery traits. All through the book, Jobs is a case study – a brash, young leader who dominates team process and business operations – used by Warren to illustrate his points. There are other people stories, of course, such as that of Richard Champion de Crespigny, the heroic Qantas pilot, to depict leadership. Through compelling stories and data Warren shows the links between personality and leadership. But can you use it for organisational effectiveness? Well, the book thoughtfully closes with self-reflection exercises for the reader.

The research firm did not say which products it expects, or the manner in which they will be announced. Following our report, some Japanese analysts have predicted that a second-generation 9.7-inch iPad Pro will be announced next week, according to Japanese blog Mac Otakara. The analysts are reportedly basing this prediction on supply chain information and the lack of a scheduled Apple event next week. Given that Apple usually invites the media to a launch event at least 10 days beforehand, and if the information we were provided about Apple announcing new products as early as next week is accurate, it is possible the so-called "iPad Pro 2" could be announced via press release rather than at a launch event. A press release could be an appropriate manner for Apple to announce a new 9.7-inch iPad Pro, given that rumors suggest it will be an iterative upgrade. One of the only rumored additions to the 9.7-inch iPad Pro is quad microphones, while Mac Otakara suggests it could have a faster Apple A10X chip. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo expects Apple to launch a low-cost 9.7-inch iPad Pro this year, likely with its current Apple A9X chip. He did not mention an entirely new 9.7-inch model. If the 9.7-inch iPad Pro is essentially only getting a price cut, then a press release as early as next week would be fitting. Apple similarly issued a press release when it dropped the price of the fourth-generation iPad to $399 in March 2014. Apple's current low-cost 9.7-inch model, the iPad Air 2, starts at $399, while the 9.7-inch iPad Pro starts at $599. Beyond the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, Apple is rumored to launch an all-new 10.5-inch iPad Pro with slimmer bezels and an updated 12.9-inch iPad Pro in the near future. A few reports claim a new 7.9-inch iPad Pro could also be released, but some analysts disagree and do not expect the iPad mini 4 to be updated. The 10.5-inch iPad Pro is expected to have slimmer bezels, and there is a slim chance it will have no Home button, allowing it to have the same overall footprint as the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. This design could foreshadow the rumored 5.8-inch iPhone. The tablet is also rumored to have a higher-resolution display and quad microphones. The updated 12.9-inch iPad Pro is said to feature a 12-megapixel rear camera and True Tone display like the current 9.7-inch model, using advanced four-channel ambient light sensors to automatically adapt the color and intensity of the display to match the light in the surrounding environment. While it is becoming clear that new iPads are on the horizon, Apple's exact launch plans remain convoluted. If Apple still plans to host an event later this month as one increasingly unlikely rumor said, it would most likely fall between Monday, March 27 and Friday, March 31, given the 10-plus-day buffer for inviting the media. At this event, the rumor said Apple will unveil its new iPad Pro lineup, a larger iPhone SE model with 128GB storage, and new Apple Watch bands. The report also claimed Apple will add a red color option for iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, which could be part of its charitable (PRODUCT)RED campaign. Of course, the event could be later. Taiwanese website DigiTimes claims Apple is planning to unveil the 10.5-inch iPad Pro at an early April event to "mark the inauguration of Apple's new headquarters in California," but it is unlikely that the supply chain sources cited would know this specific information. It is also unclear if Steve Jobs Theater would be ready for an April event, as Apple indicated it opens "later this year" while employees start moving to the new campus next month. The latest drone footage by Duncan Sinfield shows that the theater is still under construction and surrounded by mounds of dirt. Steve Jobs Theater is shown around the 1:45 mark Apple could hold an event elsewhere, or even wait until WWDC 2017 in June. Or, just like a low-cost 9.7-inch iPad Pro, a red iPhone 7, 128GB iPhone SE, and new Apple Watch bands could certainly be announced by press release or an update to Apple's website in the meantime.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple & Samsung will own 83.33% of the OLED Display Market in 2017 while Samsung Races to 7nm Chips to Win Apple Back | Main | Apple iDevice Partner Pegatron Humorously States that they'll consider a U.S. iDevice Plant if Apple Absorbs the Costs » March 15, 2017 New Study Covers Current and Future Trends in Smartphones, Digital Assistants, Wearables and More   Our first report of the day was titled "Kantar: Apple's iOS Achieved Continued Growth Across most Major Regions while Nokia's Comeback Could Impact Europe." In Kantar's second report published today titled "An Incredible Decade for the Smartphone: What's Next," they begin by noting that 2016 will go down as the year when the smartphone market stopped growing. As the smartphone industry matures, fewer consumers are moving between brands and ecosystems – and market growth has increasingly relied on replacing existing devices, rather than bringing in large numbers of new buyers.   Kantar notes that success in the new smartphone economy will require fundamental changes in tactics used by vendors to market devices and services to potential customers.   Services have been a huge focus at Apple and in fact Apple's CEO Tim Cook noted during their latest financial conference back in January that it was Apple's "best quarter ever for services with almost 7.2 billion dollars in revenue. App store customers broke all-time records during the holiday quarter including $3 billion dollars in purchases in December alone, making it the App Stores single best month ever. Our innovative and vibrant developer community has created over 2.2 million apps for doing almost anything that you could imagine. Apple's developer community has now earned over $60 billion dollars including over $20 billion in 2016 alone.   Revenue from our music business grew for the third quarter in a row and our Apple Care and iCloud storage services have all-time record results.   Services are becoming a larger part of our business and we expect the revenues to be the size of a Fortune 100 company this year. Our service offerings are now driving over 150 million paid customer subscriptions. This includes our own services and third party content that we offer on our stores. We feel great about this momentum and our goal is double the size of our services business in the next four years."   So yes, services, as Kantar points out, is going to play a huge roll in helping to retain iOS loyalty and market share, and Apple saw that trend happening well ahead of market analysts.    Apple's Amazing Customer Loyalty Record   Kantar's report went on to point to Apple's amazing customer base. They noted that among iPhone owners in the US in 2016, loyalty to the Apple iPhone was 92%. For those consumers who also owned an iPad, iPhone loyalty increased to 96%.   On the Android side, the best showing came from Samsung where loyalty to their smartphone alone was 67%, increasing to 74% if the consumer owned both a Samsung phone and tablet. That probably explains why Samsung released their largest tablet upgrade ever late last month at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.   Smartphone Trends   The first trend that Kantar sees is that consumers are opting to purchase premium models. This has become a hot area for competition and innovation, in terms of quality of material and design. For 2017, Apple's Anniversary iPhone is likely to be the runnaway winner in terms of bringing new style and features.   A second trend is the shift to Larger screen devices. They're in popularity with 46% of Chinese smartphone sales now dominated by devices with a 5.5" or larger display. In the U.S. market over a quarter of smartphones sold had a screen size of 5.5" or larger.   The leading driver of purchase across US, China, and Europe is the size of the screen, followed by the quality of the camera.   The one trend that could potentially hurt Apple is consumers wanting better pricing for premium phones. In the U.S. (43%) and Great Britian (36%) buyers cited that pricing was becoming their leading criterion for making a purchase.   Getting customers to upgrade more regularly is important and currently manufacturers feel that the carriers have not worked hard enough to convince customers to take advantage of the carrier's own upgrade offers.   In response, both Apple and Samsung now offer branded upgrade plans directly to consumers. These programs enable manufacturers to earn higher gross margins through direct-to-consumer sales, but as sales from these channels remain a small part of the overall smartphone business, sales momentum still rests firmly with the carriers rather than the manufacturers.   The Disappointment in Wearables   Wearables were expected to be the next big mobile technology, promising to expand the smartphone ecosystem to the wrist. However, judging from disappointing sales results, vendors were far more excited by the potential than were consumers. Sluggish sales of smartwatches have resulted in Lenovo's Moto and Microsoft both announcing in late 2016 that they would stop production of their wearables. Jawbone ceased production in May 2016, and early-riser Pebble was acquired by Fitbit, which recently announced it is laying off 6% of its workforce.   As disappointing as the wearables have been, Apple's Q4 performance in the pure smartwatch category was a 'magnificent success' according to IDC's March report.   Virtual/Augmented/Mixed Reality Not Moving the Needle   Virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), the growing importance of artificial intelligence (AI), and virtual assistants may help stimulate future growth. But without more compelling applications for these technologies, they may end up being more hype than substance. What the market needs is a satisfying combination of technology, content, and services that make consumers lives easier, rather than adding complexity with no significant benefits.   Projects to date include Google's Daydream virtual reality and Project Tango, Facebook's Oculus Rift and Microsoft's HoloLens.   While Apple's CEO has talked up Augmented Reality, it remains a much longer term project for Apple. True there's a constant string of patents and rumors of a future headset but nothing that points to such a device being close to coming to market. A killer app is needed to spark real interest in this area of the consumer market and Apple may be the one to once again lead the way.   How low is the interest in such gadgets at present? Well, in Scandinavia virtual headsets hit 3% of the market while in Sweden it's at a whopping rate of 4%. It's barely better than smartwatches which are at 5%. So at present, smartphones and tablets are still the kings of consumer gadgetry.   Innovations on the Horizon   The Promise of a Full-Fledged Virtual Assistant Personal assistants like Siri, Google Now, and Cortana have been available in smartphones for a few years, but usage beyond settling bar room arguments has been limited.   The introduction of the Amazon Echo and Google Home over the past couple of years has reinvigorated this space, with the promise of a truly intelligent machine that makes it easier to do everything from playing music to buying home supplies.   In the US and EU5, fewer than 25% of smartphone owners used a virtual assistant in the past month. In China, however, usage hovers around 63%, offering a glimpse of what the future can hold if the assistant concept is done well. With the integration of Amazon Alexa no longer limited to the Echo, along with a partnership with Huawei, and the indication that Google Assistant, currently limited to the Home and Pixel line of products, will replace Google Now across Android devices, this space can be expected to become an important battleground for vendors in 2017.   As for Apple, there have been rumors and a spattering of patents about Apple's Siri being a part of an in-home automation system that could be a part of Apple TV.   During Apple's last financial conference call in January, Apple's CEO talked up Siri and the smart home. Cook noted that "I'm personally using HomeKit accessories and the Home App to integrate iOS into my home routine. Now when I say good morning to Siri my house lights come on and my coffee starts brewing. When I go io the living room to relax in the evening I use Siri to adjust the lighting and turn on the fireplace. And when I leave the house, a simple tap on my iPhone turns the lights off, adjusts the thermostat down and locks the door. When I return to my house in the evening as I near my home, the house prepares itself for my arrival automatically by using a simple geofence. This level of home automation was unimaginable just a few years ago and its here today with iOS and HomeKit." If Cook is talking it up it's because more advances with Siri on this front are probably in the works.   Kantar's special report ends by noting that "For companies in the mobile space, the days of business as usual are gone. If mobile manufacturers want to preserve the global brands they have worked so hard to build, they must trail blaze new, innovative offerings, and nurture fertile, new partnerships. If they fail to do this, they can be sure that a rival will. The opportunity is there for the taking."   Apple has led the way with the iPhone and iPad, is the leader in the smartwatch arena with little to no competition to speak of, is constantly advancing Siri even though it needs a major boost in the arm in the not-too-distant future and Augmented Reality is something that Apple is working hard on.   Apple has a lot of work going on in the 3D space for an in-air gesturing interface that may play well in the headset space down the road.   Without a doubt Apple still has the most solid round of consumer gadgets and we're constantly told that Apple has a deep pipeline of products in the works. No one to date but Apple has had success and profits from their smart devices even if they're not first at everything.   While Google, Amazon and Microsoft have introduced interesting new products ahead of Apple, nothing has been a market killer despite the hype in the press. It's true that the market is getting a little bored waiting for a new exciting trend to emerge but it may take a year or two more before we see the next iPhone or iPad type of gadget emerge.   For now, the best thing to look forward to is Apple's anniversary iPhone and that's unfortunately six or more months away. If we're lucky Apple may surprise us with exciting new iPads shortly and maybe something new to shake things up – like an all-new Apple Music-TV service.   Until that rolls out, do you see any new emerging trend that has a chance for a knockout product in 2017?

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Galaxy S8 vs. iPhone 7 Plus: Hands-on video with S8 mockup shows how they compare Zach Epstein @zacharye March 15th, 2017 at 10:56 AM Share Tweet Apple’s iPhone 7 Plus features a screen that measures 5.5 inches diagonally. While nothing is set in stone at this point, multiple reports from reliable sources suggest that the Galaxy S8 — the smaller of the two flagship phones set to be unveiled by Samsung two weeks from today — sports a display that measures 5.8 inches diagonally. On paper, it seems like these two smartphones should be relatively similar in size, no? Well, as we can see in a new hands-on comparison video, Samsung’s bold new Galaxy S8 design is even more impressive than we thought when you line it up next to Apple’s flagship phablet. Don't Miss: Leaks reveal the 10 most exciting new features coming to Samsung’s Galaxy S8 With the Galaxy S8, Samsung has managed to stuff a 5.8-inch Super AMOLED display into a smartphone that is barely bigger than Apple’s 4.7-inch iPhone 7. It’s one thing to read those words, but it’s another thing entirely to see the smaller of Samsung’s two new Galaxy S8 phones lined up next to its stiffest competition. Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ flagship phones feature a bold new design that does away with the oblong home button beneath the displays and narrows the bezels above and below the screens substantially. As a result, the company is able to fit a very large screen into a phone with an overall footprint that isn’t much bigger than the screen itself. How does that play out in the real world? The video below comes courtesy of YouTuber KK Sneak Leaks, and it shows what is believed to be a perfectly sized mockup of the Galaxy S8 created using accurate schematics leaked by the factories building Samsung’s new flagship phone. In the video, the narrator shows the phone next to Apple’s iPhone 7 Plus, which features a display that measures 5.5 inches compared to the 5.8-inch screen on the Galaxy S8. At around the 4:14 mark, you can see how the two phones compare in overall size. Again, the Galaxy S8 shown in the video is not a genuine handset. Instead, it is a mockup that is believed to have been built exactly to scale. With that in mind, it’s pretty incredible to see just how much smaller Samsung’s Galaxy S8 is, with it’s 5.8-inch display, than the iPhone 7 Plus and its smaller 5.5-inch screen. And of course, if you want to see a real Galaxy S8 in action for comparison, you can always check out the exclusive Galaxy S8 photos we published earlier this month. Meanwhile, the larger Galaxy S8+ Plus is expected to cram a massive 6.2-inch display into a phone that is roughly the same size as the iPhone 7 Plus. You can see size comparisons of those two phones in this post.

What’s more, Kuo believes that Apple’s highly anticipated iPhone 8 will achieve far more momentum in the marketplace once released later this year. Now this isn’t to say that the S8 will be a boring release, but rather that the leap from the S7 to the S8 will pale in comparison to the leap we’ll see from Apple’s iPhone this year. Kuo writes that Galaxy S8 shipments for the year will likely fall in the 40-45 million unit range, decidedly lower than the 52 million Galaxy S7 units that shipped last year. Of course, there are some qualifications to keep in mind, namely that the S7 launched 6 weeks earlier than the rumored April 21 launch date of the S8. Additionally, Samsung’s Note 7 disaster likely steered many consumers towards the S7, a benefit that the S8 hopefully won’t enjoy this year. READ  Three Mobile Apps That Might Help Your Productivity Nonetheless, it’s hard to disagree with Kuo’s assessment of the 2017 smartphone landscape. Samsung’s Galaxy S8 will undoubtedly sport some nice new features, but it’s not as if it will represent an unprecedented step up in quality and performance. Apple’s rumored iPhone 8, in stark contrast, will arguably represent the biggest leap forward in iPhone technology we’ve seen in years, if not ever. Even though many of the features Apple will introduce on the iPhone 8 won’t be new to the smartphone marketplace, they’ll be new to existing iPhone users which is all that really matters. Said to feature an advanced and edgeless OLED display, Apple’s iPhone 8 will finally usher in a brand new design to a form factor that has more or less remained stagnant since 2014. Further, it’s widely believed that the iPhone 8 will deliver improvements in battery life, system performance, Siri functionality and even a brand new wireless charging capability. Again, none of the above features embody new or groundbreaking advances in smartphone design, but the step up from the iPhone 7 to the iPhone 8 — which may very well be called the iPhone Edition — will be as stark a break from the past as we’ve seen Apple make yet. READ  AK-47 Designer, Mikhail Kalashnikov, Gone at 94 So while Android proponents might rightfully point out that features like an edgeless display, wireless charging and stellar battery life are already familiar to Android users, that will do nothing to stifle what will likely be the largest iPhone refresh cycle we’ve ever seen. Additionally, it’s worth highlighting that the Galaxy S8 may not even reach feature parity with last year’s iPhone insofar as the S8 will not feature the dual camera scheme that enables the iPhone 7 Plus’ popular Portrait Mode. Taken all together, Kuo opines: that “we are conservative on demand for Galaxy S8, and believe its contribution to the supply chain will be limited. Instead we recommend focusing on the sales outlook and supply chain momentum of Apple’s (US) OLED iPhone model.” Credit: BGR Technology Share Tweet Share Join the discussion Cancel reply Name * Email * Related Posts See All Robot Cars With No Human Driver Could Hit California Roads Next Year Source code theft threatens nation’s software industry Google updates: Gmail to always show photos included in emails Global online video market to be worth $37b in 2017 – Report Job Vacancy: Solution Architect Packet Core- Nigeria Instagram To Also Follow Facebook In Showing Posts Out Of Order “Great”- The Codename For Samsung Galaxy Note 8 Job Opportunities: Franchise Business Opportunity in IT (IMS) Training by Asia’s Leading IT Training Institute Categories Menu News Photonews Oduduwa Entertainment Osun Politics Op-Ed Sports Economy Agriculture Technology Others Main Menu Home About Read paper Term of Use Contact Us Subscribe & Follow Join Copyright © 2006 - 2017 Osun Defender, All rights reserved.

According to a new report today, however, the so-called premium iPhone 8 model may only be visually more advanced rather than functionally. Sony A6500 Nikkei Asian Review has new reporting on how Apple plans to implement the rumored curved OLED display on the new iPhone models. The summary is that the curve won’t be as dramatic as on Samsung’s Galaxy S7 Edge smartphones and will be purely for visual effect rather than offering new features: The curve will be gentler than screens in Samsung’s Galaxy S7 Edge handsets. This is partly due to the challenges of making curved glass covers to match screens, according to the source. While the curved screen will allow a viewable area of about 5.2 inches and make the iPhone even sleeker, it will not offer significant new functions, the person said. That means we shouldn’t expect gimmicky features like app pinning or text banners on the sides of the new panel based on this report. The curved panel would only be for the aesthetic effect and physical feel. Nikkei adds that Samsung will be the sole provider of these curved displays for the new iPhone models. As for recent reports suggesting the OLED displays on new iPhones could be flat and not curved, Nikkei’s source believes this less dramatic curve will indeed be present and different from current iPhone displays: Some reports suggest in recent days that Apple will only give the premium handset a flat display, but the source said that would not be using OLED optimally. Nonetheless, the design has not been finalized and could still change. Aside from the new display type and style, Apple is expected to introduce wireless charging functionality, stronger water resistance, a new function area on the 5.8-inch display with 5.2-inches of usable space, possible 3D sensing front-facing camera features, and more.

Now, the CEO of Pegatron, one of Apple’s manufacturing partners, has addressed the topic of U.S. manufacturing in a new interview… Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case As noted by Focus Taiwan, Pegatron CEO Liao Syh-jang was asked about the company’s plans for United States production at a recent investor conference. Specifically, Liao was asked about the effects that potential reform set forth by President Trump could have on Pegatron. Liao explained that Pegatron is willing to manufacture in the United States, but with one condition: the client would have to absorb the added costs. In the case of manufacturing the iPhone in America, this means that Apple, somewhat unsurprisingly, would be stuck with footing the bill: “As long as there is demand, whether the clients are American or Chinese, Pegatron already has its production lines in place,” Liao said. “If Trump institutes his Made in America proposal, it will be fine for Pegatron as long the client is willing to absorb the costs.” It was reported last November that Apple had asked Foxconn and Pegatron to investigate the possibility of United States manufacturing.  It was believed at the time that Pegatron had refused Apple’s request because of the cost concerns, but it now appears that the company has become slightly more open to the idea as long as it’s not the one bearing the burden of the cost. Furthermore, it was reported earlier this year that Apple and Foxconn were “mulling” a $7 billion investment in U.S. manufacturing with a “highly automated” display facility. Nothing has been announced regarding this rumored initiative, though. Tim Cook has commented on the idea of Apple manufacturing in the past, explaining that China put a bigger focus on manufacturing than the United States and thus the U.S. simply doesn’t have the labor necessary: China put an enormous focus on manufacturing. The U.S., over time, began to stop having as many vocational kind of skills. I mean, you can take every tool and die maker in the United States and probably put them in a room that we’re currently sitting in. In China, you would have to have multiple football fields. Cook also, however, attended a meeting of tech power figures at Trump Tower last year where it was believed that U.S. manufacturing was a central point of conversation.

Their renewable energy projects will produce over 12 MW of solar power — more than the energy they need for Apple manufacturing — and support Japan’s nationwide efforts to limit its carbon emissions. “These innovative new clean energy investments demonstrate our commitment to doing business responsibly and economically,” said Kyoichi Yamanaka, Managing Director of Ibiden’s Environment Group. “Our products help Apple devices run smarter, and now we’re powering our operations with smarter energy too. We’re pleased to partner with Apple and lead the way in helping Japan meet its clean energy goals.” Apple and its suppliers will be generating over 2.5 billion kilowatt hours per year of clean energy for the manufacturing of Apple products by the end of 2018 — equal to taking over 400,000 cars off the road for a year. Apple has taken significant steps to protect the environment by transitioning from fossil fuels to clean energy. Today, the company is powering 100 percent of its operations in 23 countries, and more than 93 percent of its worldwide operations, with renewable energy.

It’s an unusual announcement for a number of reasons — firstly, people don’t normally know or care who’s working on Apple’s security team — but Zdziarski is a little different. Don't Miss: Leaks reveal the 10 most exciting new features coming to Samsung’s Galaxy S8 Zdziarski is a prominent security consultant who’s also been a thorn in Apple’s side for years. Most notably, he’s called out Apple for shipping a version of iOS without an encrypted kernel, pulled apart Facebook’s iOS code to reveal “malware-like” code, and been a vital source of information during Apple’s short war with the FBI. In his blog post, Zdziarski briefly summarized his reasons for the move: I’m pleased to announce that I’ve accepted a position with Apple’s Security Engineering and Architecture team, and am very excited to be working with a group of like minded individuals so passionate about protecting the security and privacy of others. This decision marks the conclusion of what I feel has been a matter of conscience for me over time. Privacy is sacred; our digital lives can reveal so much about us – our interests, our deepest thoughts, and even who we love. I am thrilled to be working with such an exceptional group of people who share a passion to protect that. Zdziarski has long been an advocate for customer privacy and strong encryption. Apple’s hiring move is likely just a coincidence, a case of a company picking up a talented employee where possible. But in the current climate, going and finding a security engineer who is also well known for his ethical stance on hacking certainly sounds like a message.

International Business Times UK UK World Business Politics Fintech Technology Science Sport Entertainment Opinion Video Pictures Log out Newsletter Signup Entertainment Music Shake it up: Taylor Swift to take on Apple and Spotify with her own streaming service? Songstress filed docs for website that will feature 'non-downloadable multi-media content'. By Toyin Owoseje Updated March 15, 2017 15:36 GMT Taylor Swift reportedly requested to brand a website to feature non-downloadable content. ROBYN BECK/AFP/Getty Images After severing ties with Spotify in 2014 and taking on Apple Music over its refusal to pay artists royalties, Taylor Swift has decided that she is tired of the Bad Blood. According to TMZ, the 27-year-old pop star is launching her own streaming service. The celebrity news site reports that the songstress is shaking things up and has filed documents to create a website that will feature "non-downloadable multi-media content in the nature of audio recordings". And that is not all. The songstress is also flexing her entrepreneurial muscles by releasing a line of music products offering fans the chance to get their hands on her guitars and drumsticks. Fans may recall that Swift scored a huge win over Apple Music in 2015 after her threat to withhold her album 1989 lead to the tech giant deciding to reverse its payment policy and agree to compensate artists during the free trial. The company tweeted at the time: tweeting: "#AppleMusic will pay artist for streaming, even during customer's free trial period. We hear you @taylorswift13 and indie artists. Love, Apple" Interestingly, she recently teamed up with Apple Music. The promo showed falling off a treadmill while working out to Drake's Jumpman. Although there were murmurings of a dramatic return to Spotify in November 2016, Spotify's head of music George Ergatoudis told Newsweek: Nothing's guaranteed, admitted that nothing's guaranteed. "It's not a lock-in, but I've got every reason to be very optimistic Taylor Swift will be coming back to Spotify. I'm not saying it's done, but the indications are good, put it like that," he told Newsweek. For now her entire catalogue is still absent from the platform. It would appear that Swift may have taken a leaf out of Jay Z's book. The rapper and music mogul unveiled celebrity-backed subscription-based streaming service Tidal in 2014 after purchasing it for $56m. Sprint recently invested $200m. Although her new project will likely keep her busy for the rest of the year, Ed Sheeran recently revealed she isn't neglecting her music. He told the BBC: "Taylor [Swift] isn't going to be releasing until probably the end of this year—Christmas is the smartest time to release because that's when everyone buys records." IBTimes UK has reached out to Swift's representatives and is awaiting reply. More from IBTimes UK Beyonce more deserving of Grammys crown than Alison Krauss?

The issue involves Apple’s iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c, as well as all of the company’s iPhone 6 models. The case stems from when Apple first put those specific iPhones on sale in Russia. The FAS said that after Apple set its price for the iPhones, if it found certain retailers selling iPhones at lower prices the company would then pressure those retailers to change their prices. Apple is said to have threatened the 16 retailers with cancelling sales agreements if they didn’t get their iPhone prices in line with the company. The FAS said Apple cooperated with the investigation. Apple told the Financial Times, “We worked closely with FAS during their investigation and are glad to put this matter behind us.  We work hard to make the best products and services in the world for our customers and are deeply committed to making sure our resellers are able to compete fairly in the markets where we do business.” Apple has three months to file a challenge to the FAS ruling. The company potentially faces a fine of 15 percent of its sales in Russia.

One former Apple employee said the machine appeared after the release of the iPhone 5s and was “not very Apple-like at all.” The ex-Apple Genius said the machine had a much more utilitarian feel than Apple’s consumer devices, resembling something more like “a big clunky machine that honestly looked like someone built it in their backyard.” The device requires different iPhones to be placed in specific molds before being placed inside and has at least one liquid inside the machine that forces employees to wear gloves to prevent damage to their hands. The device features various shapes, flock paper and a gray card for calibrating the phone’s camera, but the true proprietary ability of the device is being able to pair a new Touch ID module with an old device. The iPhone is paired with an iMac and updated with one of Apple’s own in-house servers to facilitate the repair, securely linking the Touch ID sensor with the Secure Enclave, making Apple the only repair shop able to simply replace an iPhone’s screen outright without having to remove the existing Touch ID button. While independent repair shops are lobbying to gain access to Apple’s repair manuals and parts, Apple has pushed back on “right to repair” legislation, telling one official that passing such a law would make her state a “mecca for bad actors.” Comments « Russian government finds Apple guilty of price fixing Apple releases sixth betas of tvOS 10.2 and watchOS 3.2 to developers » Related Stories Apple releases seventh beta of iOS 10.3 Apple now selling 32GB iPhone 6 model in Belarus Report: Apple hasn’t yet signed onto brief opposing second executive order on immigration More than 180,000 apps could be rendered useless if iOS 11 dumps 32-bit support Russian government finds Apple guilty of price fixing Apple releases sixth betas of tvOS 10.2 and watchOS 3.2 to developers Subscribe to iLounge Weekly Recent News Apple releases seventh beta of iOS 10.3 Apple now selling 32GB iPhone 6 model in Belarus Report: Apple hasn’t yet signed onto brief opposing second executive order on immigration More than 180,000 apps could be rendered useless if iOS 11 dumps 32-bit support Russian government finds Apple guilty of price fixing Leaked image reveals Apple’s ‘iPhone Calibration Machine’ Apple releases sixth betas of tvOS 10.2 and watchOS 3.2 to developers Well-known forensic scientist and iOS security advocate hired by Apple Apple files amicus brief in support of Google’s fight against FBI’s overseas warrant Mazda announces it will add CarPlay to vehicles, but doesn’t set timeline Recent Reviews Circle with Disney Parental Control and Internet Filtering System Pioneer Rayz Plus Lightning Connector Earphones BEEM United BeMe D200 Lightning Connector Earphones Jam Audio JAM Xterior Max Rugged Wireless Bluetooth Speaker HiFiMAN Edition S Headphones Divoom Timebox Mini Bluetooth Speaker iClever BoostSound BTS-09 Bluetooth Speaker Soundcast VG1 Bluetooth Speaker PureGear PureSwitch HomeKit-enabled Wireless Smart Plug 1More Triple Driver In-Ear Headphones Recent Articles Top Five: The Best Products for Building a Smart Home with HomeKit Instant Expert: Secrets & Features of watchOS 3 Instant Expert: Secrets & Features of tvOS 10 Instant Expert: Secrets & Features of iOS 10 Inside the betas: iOS 10 Photos gets Advanced Computer Vision Inside the betas: iOS 10 Music app delivers ‘clarity and simplicity’ Inside the betas: iOS 10 Maps gets a major redesign Inside the betas: iOS 10 shakes up the user experience Inside the betas: watchOS 3 promises a real speed boost Inside the betas: A sneak peek at what’s new in tvOS 10 Win Subscribe Buy ADVERTISE | CONTACT US Search Sign up for the iLounge Weekly Newsletter iLounge is an independent resource for all things iPod, iPhone, iPad, and beyond. iPod, iPhone, iPad, iTunes, Apple TV, Mac, and the Apple logo are trademarks of Apple Inc. iLounge is © 2001 - 2017 iLounge, Inc.

The company now has 3 months to file an appeal if it so desires. If the ruling stands, Apple could be fined as much as 15 percent of its sales in Russia.

We can only now be a matter of weeks away from the event, and there appears to be just too much mess – and too many potential hazards – for Apple to risk having 1,000 people wandering through the site. Anker braided Lightning cables The footage starts by giving us a little peek into the twin tunnels leading into the site. Construction work here is still very much in evidence, with barriers, scaffolding, containers and more inside them. Vehicles and equipment still surround the main spaceship building, on both the exterior and interior, and orange mesh fencing protects the construction team as work continues on the roof. The shades designed to protect the interior from the sun – part of the passive cooling designed to minimize the energy needed to control temperatures – appear mostly complete on the interior as well as exterior of the ring. Landscaping work inside the ring is making progress, with more trees in evidence, but there’s still a great deal of bare dirt. As for the underground theater, there’s no way to know from the footage how much progress has been made on the interior, but certainly the exterior still looks very much more like a construction site than a completed building. The surrounding land is still mostly dirt, with earth-moving equipment still in evidence. Building materials surround the raised platform, and only the roof looks finished. The small peek we get of the interior seems to show unfinished flooring with plenty of materials still stacked up ready to be fitted. Apple said that the first staff would be moving in next month, but that work would continue through the summer, and it would take six months to move in all 12,000 employees.

Edd Gent Live Science Contributor LiveScience.comMarch 15, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share Apple Rumors: What's So Great About a Curved iPhone Screen?More Apple is slated to release a new iPhone this year, and one premium model will reportedly feature a curved screen, news reports said. These curved displays seem to be all the rage, with companies designing the screens for everything from smartphones to televisions. But what, if anything, do you gain from the curve? Plenty of others phone makers have released curved screens, but Samsung was the first with the release of the concave Samsung Galaxy Round in 2013. Since then firms have experimented with various different kinds of curves, but when Samsung introduced the convex dual-curved sides to its flagship Galaxy S6 in 2015 it set the zeitgeist and most phone makers have since toed the line. Rumors about Apple's curved iPhone were reported by The Wall Street Journal. Citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter, the Journal reported that Apple would be releasing a high-end version of its 10th-anniversary iPhone, alongside the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus; this version will have a curved screen and be priced at around $1,000. [10 Technologies That Will Transform Your Life] And Apple is hardly the only company investing in this display technology. Samsung was the first to release a smartphone with a curved display, the concave Samsung Galaxy Round, in 2013. Since then, other companies have experimented with different kinds of curves, but in 2015, when Samsung introduced the convex, dual-curved sides to its flagship Galaxy S6, the company seemed to ignite a new trend. Tellingly, The Korea Herald also reported that Samsung could end up supplying Apple with the curved screens. This is because Apple currently uses liquid crystal display (LCD) technology in its iPhones, and creating curved screens is practical only with organic LED (OLED) displays. These displays, which are also used in TVs, rely on a thin film of organic compound — that is, a compound that contains carbon — which emits light in response to an electric current. LCDs, on the other hand, require backlighting to shine light through the liquid crystals. Early work Samsung pioneered OLED technology in the early 2000s, and has built up a market-leading position in the development of the small OLED displays used in smartphones, said Karl Leo, director of the Integrated Center for Applied Physics and Photonic Materials at the Technical University Dresden in Germany. "Samsung took a high risk to develop the production processes," Leo told Live Science. "Initially, for a couple of years, Samsung had the market to itself, and since obviously Apple and Samsung are competitors, Apple clearly had a problem with the need to establish independent manufacturing facilities that have enough capacity for the very large number of displays it needs." While mass-producing OLEDs is complicated, the benefits are considerable, and several other companies are now producing the screen on a large scale, Leo said. OLED displays can have higher contrasts — blacker blacks and brighter whites — than LCD displays, he said. And unlike with LCDs, looking at an OLED screen from narrow angles does not distort the color or contrast, he added. Most importantly, OLEDs emit light themselves and so don't need backlighting, and this allows for much thinner displays, Leo said. In addition, the films of organic compounds are soft, making it possible to create a curved screen, he said. But why would you want a curved screen? The curved edges of the Samsung Galaxy S6, which introduced the de facto standard for curved smartphone screens, featured various new functions. These included shortcuts and information that can be seen at a quick glance on the long, curved edges of the device. But Samsung said the main goal was to tackle "FoMo," or fear of missing out, reported The Daily Telegraph. The phone allows users to assign a color for up to five contacts, and the screen lights up in that color if they call. When the screen is face down, users can still see the curved edges, so it's possible to tell if a friend is calling even if users are in a situation where it would be rude to check their phone. Design vs. function However, design choices are the main reason behind the new trend for curved screens, not functionality, said Leo, who owns a Galaxy S7 Edge himself. "It's a desire [of] manufactures to distinguish themselves, but in my opinion this has its limits," he said. [11 Odd and Intriguing Smart Home Technologies] Read More I must frankly say a curved screen is a minor step," He said that the ultimate promise of OLED technology is flexible screens that can be bent and twisted without damaging them and even screens so supple they can be rolled up like a towel. There are considerable challenges to overcome before reaching that promise though, he said. Creating highly flexible displays will require a flexible substrate (the layer on which the OLEDs are applied) rather than the glass substrate that is typically used today, he said. OLEDs also need to be protected from humidity and oxygen; otherwise, the pixels get damaged and stop working, Leo said. With a glass substrate, this is not too difficult, but if phone manufacturers switch to a flexible plastic substrate, it is much more challenging to keep oxygen and humidity levels low enough, he added. It's not just the OLEDs that need to be flexible, though. The transistor backplane — the layer of  components responsible for electronically switching each pixel on and off — will need to be flexible as well, Leo said. He said that flexible organic transistors could solve this problem, but these materials are still a ways away from being commercially available, which means truly flexible displays aren't likely to appear anytime soon, according to Leo. But unlike curved phone screens, when flexible displays do arrive, they will be cause for real excitement Leo said. For example, he says one could imagine a phone display that could be rolled up tight enough that it could fit inside a pen. When you want to use the phone display you simply unfurl it from the pen and then it rolls back up once you're done. "Wouldn't that be lovely?" he said. Or at home, imagine if your television is actually rolled up like a window shade, and if you want to use it, you pull it down, watch TV, and then simply zip it up again. "So, for flexible displays, there are many beautiful applications," Leo said. "You can put them anywhere. You can put them in garments, so flexibility would be really a breakthrough for many applications." Original article on Live Science.

Apple Hires Privacy Advocate and Security Researcher Jonathan Zdziarski GO Apple just improved its security team with a new hire Mar 15, 2017 14:23 GMT  ·  By Gabriela Vatu  ·  Share:  Apple has just improved its security team by adding a new member - forensic consult and security researcher Jonathan Zdziarski, a man who has been quite involved with the iOS community over the years.  Zdziarski shared the news on his personal blog. "I'm pleased to announce that I've accepted a position with Apple's Security Engineering and Architecture team, and am very excited to be working with a group of like-minded individuals so passionate about protecting the security and privacy of others," he writes. The security expert adds that it feels like the decision is just the conclusion of what has been a matter of conscience for him. "Privacy is sacred; our digital lives can reveal so much about us - our interests, our deepest thoughts, and even who we love," he explains. Community work Zdziarski has been one of the most notable voices back when Apple was fighting with the FBI over the San Bernardino shooter's iPhone. At the time, the FBI was demanding Apple to crack the device, but the company refused, saying there was nothing they could do, even if they wanted to. In the end, the FBI found a way around the encryption and no longer needed Apple's help. Currently, the intelligence agency is fighting against several organizations asking it to divulge its cracking method. In response, the FBI said that it can't do that because it's still a useful tool to have, and they're still using it. Over the years, he also found backdoors into iOS and discovered security flaws in many popular apps, so it's probably good news that he's now joining Apple's security team to work on doing some good for the iOS community. While his tone may change a bit now that he's officially employed by the tech giant, he's clearly going to be a good addition to the company. #Apple#Jonathan Zdziarski#Security Engineering and Architecture#iOS security subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news FBI: We're Still Using the San Bernardino iPhone Cracking Method & Won't Share Microsoft on WikiLeaks CIA Files: Windows 10 Systems Are Safe WikiLeaks Will Work with Tech Companies to Fix Security Flaws Exploited by CIA Linux Foundation on Vault 7: Frequent Security Updates Protect Linux Users Samsung Galaxy S8 Features Camera and Iris Scanner Improvements LibreOffice 5.3 Office Suite Gets First Point Release with 100 Improvements Study: 96% of Websites Get Attacked by Bad Bots Windows 10 Creators Update Hides a Secret Ad Switch, Privacy Group Warns YouTube Discontinues Annoying Annotations LXLE 16.04.2 GNU/Linux Distro to Bring All the Goodies from Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS Netflix Turns to Thumbs Up/Down Ratings, Ditches 5-Stars System Intel Launches Bug Bounty Program, Offers Rewards of Up to $30,000    Apple adds new blood to security team Related Apps Passware Encryption Analyzer: Seamlessly find all password-protected files on your computer and find out how to overcome their encryption with this application Passware Password Recovery Kit Forensic: A complete password recovery and e-discovery solution that can help you decrypt and obtain passwords from almost any file and website Your Freedom: A all-in-one VPN tunneling, firewall and proxy bypassing, anonymization and anti-censorship solution that enables you to browse the Internet in a secure way Bitcoin Password: This easy to use application can help you recover your Bitcoin wallet password by using customizable dictionary, brute force or mixed attacks GridinSoft Anti-Malware: Scan your computer for malware and dangerous files, adware and other malicious components with the help of this intuitive application Passware Password Recovery Kit Basic: A fast and efficient password recovery software that can reveal email, Internet and network passwords and decrypt documents altogether Adlice PEViewer: Analyze the structure of running processes and executable files on your computer to detect potentially dangerous activity on your system Reader comments The Fappening 2.0 Is Starting: Emma Watson, Amanda Seyfried Photos Dumped Online more on: The Fappening i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

Stay Connected With Hypebot.com « Why I Chose Patreon [BRIAN HAZARD] | Main | The Fight For A Straight Count: Does Streaming Accounting Costing More Than Royalites » Indie Artists Can't Afford To Skip Streaming: A Look At The Numbers In this illuminating look at a year in streaming, CD Baby CEO Tracy Maddux examines how indie artists are beginning to see appreciable payouts from online streaming services, although other revenue sources still remain important and valuable. ___________________________ Guest post by Tracy Maddux, CEO of CD Baby It was a watershed year for the half-million or so artists and labels CD Baby distributes worldwide in 2016. It was the year its artists' lifetime gross earnings crossed the half-a billion-dollar mark (yep, $500,000,000). But the most important trend was that revenue from streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music overtook downloads as the number one source of artists' sales. We're pleased to see that independent artists are now making more money from their music thanks to the growth in streaming. Of all digital revenue, streaming represented only 32 percent of gross earnings in 2015. In 2016, that ratcheted up to almost half. And including ad-supported YouTube monetization, streaming and YouTube combined represented 52 percent of artists' revenue. But other sources of revenue are still important as well -- both to the artist and the consumers whose preference favors other formats. We saw vinyl sales grow again last year, but more slowly in 2016. We saw CD sales decline by about 12 percent; the third consecutive year of contraction. And downloads, while also declining by 12 percent in 2016, still makeup more than a third of artist revenues. Our common-sense guidance to self-distributed artists and small labels is to monetize their music everywhere they can, which brings us to an important point. What's really behind a shift in earnings is not 'big tech' that doesn't care about the artists; it's the fans who are choosing to consume music via streaming. It's a shift in consumer behavior. There are tens of millions more people consuming music via streaming every year. But there are also still consumers for physical and download formats. Shifts in format preferences take time. They never happen all at once but are inevitable once started. That's why we think artists should get their music everywhere the fans are willing to consume it. We understand that some artists are concerned about the viability of streaming services. But we shouldn't ignore the fact that in 2016 there are now profitable streaming services. Rhapsody attained profitability last year. Streaming at Apple, Amazon and Google are likely profitable as the large firms already have the scale and scope to sustain a service. As long as artists are growing their earnings with these services, they should consider focusing on how their fans are choosing to experience music. If any of the large digital service providers fail in the next several years, there will be another in its place to pick up their clients. Consumer behavior is the only thing that matters. READ MORE Universal Music 2016 Earnings: Streaming Drove Revenue Growth for Recordings, Publishing CD Baby's digital catalog grew to over seven million tracks last year. We figure it's among the largest catalogs in the world and represents 15-20 percent of the content available on Spotify and Apple Music. It's also growing pretty fast -- we added about 750,000 tracks in 2016. And many of those tracks make real money. CD Baby Members had combined gross earnings of over $83 million from all sources last year (about $44 million of it from streaming and YouTube). What we liked the most about these earnings is that they grew in absolute terms. That means we paid out more money in total, and each member made more money in 2016, thanks, again, to streaming. Trying to use pretzel logic that these artists are starving and they should earn more (they should) misses an important fact that many of the artists derive income from other sources, like sales on other platforms, touring and merch. Recently I received a letter from a label that uses CD Baby for distribution services and the gist of it was, "My songs aren't earning what they used to -- how can I reverse the trend?" When we took a look at the data, we noticed that the label hadn't released anything in awhile, it hadn't opted into some streaming services and it wasn't actively using the new tools of promotion now available to artists to engage and discover new fans. It's no secret -- some songs earn more than other similar songs because they are being promoted. Art isn't entitled to an equal share of income from any source just because the art is good. To succeed in any format requires artists to actively harness the tools of promotion, especially those tools available on these new platforms that are reaching the incremental millions using subscription services. These tools, from analytics to playlists, are powerful and more available to independent artists than ever before, leveling the playing field for independent artists. There are a vast number of platforms and tools accessible to artists who want to drive their sales themselves. We greatly admire the work that Bandcamp does for indies -- according to a recent letter to the industry, CD sales on its site were up by 14 percent and downloads by 20 percent in 2016. This bucks the trend in the rest of the industry and shows a growing share of a declining market.  On the promotional side, the free tools the DSPs offer, such as Apple Connect, Pandora AMP and Spotify, are a great way to claim a profile, connect with fans and command the data. We offer trending data from Apple Music, iTunes and Spotify on CDBaby as well. Tools like Show.co can help artists manage a promotional campaign and HearNow is a simple, low cost tool to promote releases. These are just a few tools a click away from artists willing to invest the time. Average earnings per CD Baby artist grew solidly in 2016 because of streaming. While in prior years we had seen growth in downloads and streaming offset some of the declines in physical, 2016 was the year that growth in streaming revenue offset all of the declines in other formats. All of the industry is growing again because of this shift in consumer behavior. Is it 1999 again yet -- the peak of recorded music? Nope. But our advice to independent artists: don't ignore a huge opportunity to connect with fans who are streaming. There will be millions more in 2017.

MOST POPULAR: Australia has one of the world’s highest iPhone market shares Bendigo and Adelaide Bank, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, National Australia Bank and Westpac Bank began their campaign to encourage Apple to open access to the NFC technology within its handsets in July 2016. The banks said the introduction of third-party mobile wallets in Australia on a non-exclusive basis would “increase competition, customer choice and confidence, innovation and investment in mobile wallet and mobile payment services across the industry”. Their latest submission to the ACCC comes as Mastercard reveals that more than four in five Australians (82%) are now using contactless payments every week — 26% are aware that they have NFC mobile payments on their phone and, of those that are not aware, 36% would consider using it. Collective negotiation “The applicants developed their own NFC mobile wallets on the Android platform before any of the current multi-issuer mobile wallets were announced,” the banks write. “They now participate in or are in negotiations with multi-issuer wallets and look forward to collectively negotiating on the issue of NFC access with Apple and offering Apple Pay to their customers. “They also expect that other providers of mobile wallets and other NFC functions would emerge to meet particular demands. These might be merchants, telecommunications providers such as Optus Pay in Australia or SingTel and Orange internationally, and financial technology startups such as Myki Plus, an NFC app to interact with Melbourne’s public transit cards — but only on the Android platform. “Some of these international examples have relied on the Android platform and on non-NFC point of sale technologies such as PIN or barcodes. These countries have less NFC infrastructure in place than Australia and Android has a much greater presence. “These alternatives are unrealistic in Australia, which has the world’s highest adoption of contactless NFC card payments and one of the world’s highest iPhone market shares, particularly among customers likely to use mobile payments.” “In Australia, potential mobile wallet providers other than Apple are locked out of the established payment infrastructure in respect of the clear majority of relevant customers,” the banks add. “NFC access on the iPhone would greatly enhance these opportunities and provide substantial public benefits.” ‘Contactless embraced’ Australians are most frequently using contactless cards at supermarkets (54%), general retail stores (22%) and petrol stations (11%), the Mastercard research finds. 33% have been “annoyed” when a store didn’t offer support for the technology, and one in 10 have avoided a store that they knew didn’t offer it. “Overall, Australians see tap and go as a convenient and time-saving way to pay,” says Garry Duursma from Mastercard. “Australians have largely embraced contactless payments as a part of their everyday lives, indicating that consumers are starting to gain a real understanding and appreciation for the benefits of contactless. “The survey findings indicate an increasing demand on retailers to take advantage of more innovative payment methods, with the majority of Australians believing that businesses that offer contactless technology are making it easier for their customers.” Apple Pay launched in Australia in November 2015 with support from American Express. The company met with resistance from the banks before ANZ became the first of the country’s big four to add support for the service in April 2016.

Apple.Com/Mac A lot of Apple fans are waiting for the company’s fresh batch of new products. And even though the next iPhone is getting the most hype, a large portion of the Cupertino, California-based tech titan’s fans are looking forward to the MacBook 2017 models. Apple has been tight-lipped about its upcoming laptop line-up, but the new set of MacBooks is reportedly going to be worth the wait. The Apple laptop that has experienced the most recent refresh is the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, which was launched during the company’s October event last year. No updated MacBook and MacBook Air were presented at the conference, and Apple eventually dropped the 11-inch Air after the affair. The Mac-maker may be leaning towards replacing the Air series with the upcoming 12-inch MacBook model. Just like the expected 2017 revamp of the iMac, the upcoming MacBooks have been unsurprisingly linked to Intel’s latest Kaby Lake chipset, which has DisplayPort 1.2, Thunderbolt 3 and USB 3.1 support. According to a Bloomberg report from last month, Apple is designing a new chip for the next batch of MacBooks that would “take on more of the functionality currently handled by Intel processors.” The new chip, which is internally known by its T310 codename, is reportedly going to deal with the “Power Nap” feature while also enhancing the Mac laptops’ battery life. Previous reports indicate that the MacBook 2017 models, which could launch in early third quarter, may come in two RAM variants: the standard 8 GB model and a 16 GB option. The 8 GB model should do well as the more affordable option, while the 16 GB unit will be a godsend to those who have been longing for an Apple laptop with a memory upgrade. The upcoming MacBook Pro 2017 model is, of course, keeping the Touch Bar. The 13-inch basic Pro laptop may reportedly sell for around US$2,199 (AU$2,898), while the 15-inch variant with Touch Bar could carry a price tag of US$4,249 (AU$5,599). If the projected price of the upcoming iPhone is any indication, the new MacBook Pro units may be priced even higher. No less than a 3,200 x 1,800 QHD+ display is expected on the MacBook Pro 2017 as Apple is set on improving its Retina Display, which has been left behind by other devices. A premium model has also been mentioned in earlier reports, which could pack up to 32 GB of RAM.

We’ve seen no shortage of rumours suggesting that at least one version of this year’s iPhone 8 will feature an OLED display – a first for the iPhone. But moving to this new display will require a new kind of touch sensor that industry news site Digitimes claims will cost Apple more money. According to the report, suppliers will be providing new 3D Touch modules for the OLED iPhone that will cost Apple $15 USD per unit. That’s a reported increase on the $9 module that’s currently used in iPhone handsets with traditional LCD displays. “As AMOLED panels should be matched with Out-Cell (add-on) touch solution, 3D Touch modules for use in the new iPhone equipped with AMOLED plane involves a more complicated manufacturing process and adoption of thin film-based touch sensors,” the report explains. There’s a chance that this component price rise could be passed onto consumers, although that should come as no real surprise. It’s very likely that the OLED iPhone 8 – expected to be the top-end variant – will be one of the most expensive phones on the market, by virtue of its advanced display technology. Unlike conventional LCD displays, OLED screens feature pixels that produce their own light, negating the need for a backlight – and thus saving power. And because individual pixels can be turned off, you’ll get more true blacks on-screen, improving the display’s dynamic range and widening the colour gamut. Samsung has already been using OLED displays in Galaxy smartphones for years, but that’s no surprise: Samsung’s screen-making division currently dominates the market for phone-sized OLED panels. Apple, by contrast, has never used OLED displays on an iPhone, but will reportedly introduce the feature on the 2017 iPhone. Apple is expected to make significant design changes to the iPhone this year, including offering consumers an all-screen front design similar to what we’ve seen from the LG G6, as well as from early Samsung Galaxy S8 leaks. The design revamp is likely prompted by the fact that 2017 marks the 10th anniversary of the iPhone. Unfortunately, Apple hasn’t confirmed any details about the iPhone 8, so take all pre-launch leaks with a pinch of salt. In any case, we’d expect the iPhone 8 to be no cheaper than the £599 iPhone 7, which was marked by a price rise thanks to the waning value of Sterling.

It’s a crowded space, but Pandora says it has years of user listener data on its side. By Emily Bary March 14, 2017 8:42 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Pandora is launching its first on-demand music streaming service on Wednesday, putting the Internet radio pioneer in direct competition with Spotify and Apple Music Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto Pandora is at the nexus of all things South by Southwest: music, technology, and advertising. So it makes sense that Pandora announced the release date of its long-awaited on-demand streaming service, Pandora Premium, with SXSW under way in Austin, Tex. With music blasting in the background, Barron’s Next caught up with Chris Phillips, the company’s chief product officer, about Pandora Premium, which launches on Wednesday. The service puts Pandora in direct competition with Spotify and Apple Music. They all cost the same $9.99 a month. Here are highlights from our conversation with Phillips: Barron’s Next: How will Pandora Premium manage to stand out given the streaming competition from Spotify and Apple Music? Chris Phillips: When listeners open the app, there’s music ready to play right away. You get a playlist called “My Thumbs Up,” which is every “thumbs up” you’ve ever done on Pandora. We’re taking the work out of playlists. If you hit five thumbs up in a particular station, it automatically builds a playlist of those. You can hit a button to add similar songs – based on your listening and related songs. The app has an exciting design and changes color based on a dominant color in the album cover. More from Barron’s Next Why Music Streaming Might Be a Lousy Business What Warren Buffett Learned About the iPhone at Dairy Queen When to Buy Airline Tickets to Get The Cheapest Fare Are you worried the on-demand streaming space is too crowded? Phillips: We’re already in the game. We’re going after people who haven’t yet subscribed [to an on-demand service], who don’t want to jump back and forth between DJ radio and on demand, and they’ve just been waiting for us. By not having on demand, we’ve been hurting ourselves. Not having those features has been reason for people to fire up another app. We think people are frustrated with services out there, like Spotify and Apple Music, which are a lot of work. How is “Add Similar Songs” different than Spotify Discover [which suggests new music based on what you’ve listened to]? Phillips: We have humans who actually analyze songs, pick up on melodies, beats, vocals, and instruments. We match songs, not necessarily the artists by genre. Then we have algorithms that look at you. A lot of the other services are doing genre-based recommendations – saying we’ve classified you as a pop person who likes a little bit of country. We could all like Ed Sheeran here – one person likes the more soulful songs, one likes the pop, one likes more of a blend. We look at the individual song tastes of each listener. What are investors missing about Pandora? [Pandora shares are down 11% since the start of the year.] Phillips: We have a super sticky, loyal, engaged user base. We have a lot of behavioral data on our users. Personalization science is the future. On the ad-supported side, we use ad tech to smartly know when to serve an ad, knowing people’s behavior. Apple and Spotify are fighting over the same user base. We think we can inform other people who use radio listening. We can up-sell Premium.

Ogg March 15, 2017 9:05 am EDT Print Email Tweet Stocks were indicated to open marginally higher on Wednesday, a morning that will probably be met with a rate hike by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) later on in the day. Even with the bull market now eight years old, investors have managed to buy stocks on every pullback. Those same investors are also looking for new trading and investing ideas. 24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports each day of the week. The goal is to find new investing ideas and trading ideas for our readers. Some analyst reports cover stocks to buy, while other reports cover stocks to sell or to avoid. Some color has been added on many of the following calls, and the consensus analyst price targets referenced are from Thomson Reuters. These are the top analyst upgrades, downgrades and initiations seen on Wednesday, March 15, 2017: Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) was reiterated as Outperform at RBC Capital Markets, but the firm raised its price target to $155 from $140 (versus a $138.99 prior close). Apple’s 52-week trading range is $89.47 to $140.28 and the consensus analyst price target was last seen at $142.69. Finisar Corp. (NASDAQ: FNSR) closed down 4% at $25.69 on Tuesday but was indicated up 1.3% at $26.03 on Wednesday. It was raised to Buy from Hold at Jefferies, and the firm noted that it believes that the recent soft results and guidance and weakness in Finisar shares stem from technical product issues that likely will be resolved shortly and concerns around China where it is confident longer-term demand trends will be strong. Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) was downgraded to Neutral from Outperform and the price target was slashed to $35 from $45 (versus a $35.18 close) at Credit Suisse. The firm likes the Mobileye rationale but feels the price of Intel is just too high. Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX) was raised to Hold from Underperform at Jefferies, but the firm is caving on a lower target by raising its target to $135 from $95 (versus a $143.19 close). This call is after Jefferies conducted a survey targeting consumers in Germany and India and found that the Netflix growth opportunity appears larger than the firm had expected. Occidental Petroleum Corp. (NYSE: OXY) was raised to Buy from Neutral at Merrill Lynch. This is just a day after Credit Suisse gave a similar upgrade to Outperform. The 52-week range is $61.01 to $78.48. Snap Inc. (NYSE: SNAP) was started as Underweight and assigned an $18 price target at Cantor Fitzgerald. The shares closed down 2.4% at $20.58 on Tuesday and were indicated down 2% more at $20.17 on Wednesday. Snap’s post-IPO range has been $20.15 to $29.44, and it priced at $17 per share.

(Photo : Aban Tech/YouTube) The upcoming iPad was expected by Apple fans to be released during September 2016, as its previous model the iPad Mini 4, was released in the same month of 2015. This debut was a month earlier than the scheduled one. As the expected iPad Mini 5 was not unveiled in the recently held Apple's event last September, fans of Apple products are expecting the iPad Mini 5 to be launched this month, however, according to a source, Apple event is slated to take place on 4th of April. The Cupertino Company always organizes its spring event in March for the past few years and the report claims that the new iPad is said to launch on the next spring event for the company. Apple iPad Mini 5: Possible Design And Specifications Apple is rumored to be using Series 7000 aluminum for all new iPad lineups. The new iPad mini 5 said to be protected with an aluminum body. To be more specific, the 7000-series aluminum chassis allow the iPad to be thinner and more durable, the same materials used for the iPhone 6S and 7, which are stable and lighter compared to the lower grade aluminum used in other products. The iPad mini 5 is more likely going to look similar to the iPad mini 4, with the same size of a 7.9in retina display. Also, it's been rumored to be 5mm thick and the iPad mini 5 will come with a smaller-capacity battery in order to fit into 5mm frame. The upcoming iPad is expected to be powered by the A9 and M9 motion coprocessors and will come with iOS 10 pre-installed, and this will surely add a raft of new features and some tweaks to the interface design. New Thrilling Features Furthermore, rumors circulating the internet said that Apple will introduce a Rose Gold color option, as it has done elsewhere in its previous products line-up. New thrilling features such as 3D Touch, water-resistant, Apple Pencil, iTouch ID fingerprint scanner, Smart Connector which connects to a keyboard, Fast charging and more are expected. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo issued a report a couple of months ago suggesting that Apple would announce three new iPads in March 2017: a 12.9-inch successor to the iPad Pro, a new 10-10.5-inch "high-end model," and a 9.7-inch "low-priced variant."              TAG Apple, Apple iPad Mini 5, Apple ipad Related Articles Google Pixel 2 vs OnePlus 5: Which Flagship Should You Get?

(AAPL) Show Off in Its April Event? A report says AAPL could be throwing an April event at Apple's new 'spaceship' campus By Brad Moon, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Mar 15, 2017, 9:06 am EDT Get AAPL alerts: Submit Source: Shutterstock     View All   Popular Posts: Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Pairs With Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) in AI Power Move What Will Apple Inc.

(AAPL) Show Off in Its April Event? Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Pairs With Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) in AI Power Move View All Posts There are three announcements we’ve been waiting for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) to make in the near future: A March special event to launch an upgraded 12.9-inch iPad Pro and 9.7-inch iPad Air replacement. A third iPad –an all new 10.5-inch iPad Pro with design cues from the iPhone 8– seems ready to go in May or June. The move-in date for its new Apple Park “spaceship” campus. A new report suggests the company is juggling the timelines and plans to hold an April Apple Event combining all three. New iPads Are Overdue Apple’s iPad lineup may not be doing the same business it once was, but it’s still due for a refresh. The iPad Pro line aimed at prosumers is priced at a premium, helping to boost revenue for the division, but it competes against some tough adversaries, including Microsoft Corporation’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Surface Pro. Apple is expected to release a next generation version of 2015’s 12.9-inch iPad Pro to stay current. An all-new iPad Pro that is also expected in the late spring. This one is a 10.5-inch form factor, but it seems likely to borrow from the design of the upcoming iPhone 8, with an edge-to-edge display and virtual Home button. Doing so gives AAPL a physically smaller iPad Pro, with a display larger than the current 9.7-inch iPad Pro, making it more useful for professionals. The company is expected to also ship a replacement for the iPad Air 2, its full-sized consumer tablet that was released in 2014. The new iPad Air and 12.9-inch iPad Pro were expected to be unveiled in March, but with the month half-over, an April Apple event seems more likely. Such a move also jives with rumors back in January that AAPL might be experiencing some manufacturing challenges that could result in a later release. New iPads Identified in the Wild On Monday, 9to5 Mac broke the news that an analytics firm has detected the identifiers for new iPad models in app downloads in the Cupertino area. The model numbers show up as iPad 7,1; iPad 7,2; iPad 7,3 and iPad 7,4 — current iPad models show up in logs as iPad 6,x. 9to5 Mac notes that four new identifiers don’t necessarily mean four new models, as an iPad equipped with LTE has different numbers than the same version in a Wi-Fi-only option. The new models first showed up last September, but the frequency accelerated rapidly in January and February, indicating the new iPads are getting close to being launch-ready. Apple Park Ready for Its Grand Opening Apple Park is AAPL’s massive new headquarters, nicknamed the “spaceship campus” because of its round, futuristic design.

What is happening Apple first began telling developers to submit apps in 64-bit in 2014, shortly after it began putting 64-bit capable chips inside the iPhone 5s and iPads in 2013. The company hasn’t held off on this warning, and while it has delayed the cut-off point, it hasn’t stopped telling developers to submit 64-bit apps. In theory, this means any app released or updated since early 2015 will already be a 64-bit app. Get the message As a user, about the only way you have been able to tell if you are running a 32-bit app will have been a warning message that pops up: “This app has not been updated to 64-bit. Using it may affect overall system performance.” However, Apple will soon cease all support for 32-bit apps. As of iOS 10.3 you will find a new error message: “This app will not work with future versions of iOS. The developer of this app needs to update it to improve its compatibility.” In other words, this is the last chance dance for 32-bit code pending introduction of iOS 11 later this year. Sensor Tower claims around 187,000 apps may be affected, in addition to the 47,000 apps that were removed from the store last Fall. This also means we’ll have fewer zombie apps in the stores. A shop, not a museum In broad terms this is fine, but there are some legacy apps that mean something to users – but it is developers, not Apple, who should hold the blame. The App Store is a shop, not a museum, and developers who can’t update their software should voluntarily remove their apps from sale. In some cases, developers of loved legacy apps that may not have updated them in a very long time have recently shipped 64-bit updates, even though there is no real demand except from existing fans. Smule’s decision to update the much-loved Ocarina app is a good case in point. Why 64-bit matters Sixty four-bit apps are maybe 30 percent faster and capable of delivering richer experiences than their 32-bit ancestors.   The advantage of terminating 32-bit support is that your 64-bit iPhones and iPads will not be slowed down by the need to run 32-bit frameworks to support legacy apps you may not even have. App launch and multitasking should be faster as a result. This ability to run fast code on fast processors is an absolute advantage – just look how the iPhone 6s crushed Samsung’s explosive Galaxy phone in speed tests last year as a hint of what’s to come. Apple’s move to deploy a fully-64-bit OS and app ecosystem means it has now put a powerful, 64-bit computer inside every iPhone user’s pocket. (One that will be running a completely different file system after iOS 10.3). Why is Apple doing this? Apple knows what it has doing. It has warned developers to climb aboard the 64-bit train for years. The move has been a deliberately planned and well executed strategy. The result of this strategy is that almost every iPhone in use across the world at this moment is already a 64-bit device. Even the 64-bit iPhone SE has contributed to this. It means that in a very short time, Apple has managed to put desktop performance inside the pocket of every iPhone users and into the hands of any Mac or iPad user. Apple’s own actions show it has been consciously working toward this goal, with an aim to make this ecosystem ready for the introduction of iOS 11 and the tenth anniversary of the iPhone. A new file system and an all 64-bit ecosystem strikes me as hugely significant. With the company flagging up exciting news in Virtual Reality, Machine Intelligence, and strong rumors of a tenth anniversary device, things are shaping up for a very exciting WWDC 2017.

(image: Apple) According to a report by the BBC, US tech giants, Apple, have today been found guilty of price-fixing by Russia’s Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS). The company has reportedly been arranging for retailers to co-ordinate their prices of the Iphone 5 and Iphone 6 models. According to the Financial Times, it was Apple’s Russian subsidiary who illegally ordered the price-fixing, where non-compliance by the retailers would have led to the termination of their contracts. When the investigation was announced in August, Apple denied the charge and claimed that the prices for products in all markets across the world were set by the retailers themselves. But after a seven month investigation ended the FAS in a statement said that the price-fixing had now ended, while Apple is yet to comment. The deputy head of the FAS, Andrey Tsarikovsky, said that once the full decision is published at the end of the month, Apple will have three months to challenge the decision in court. Tsarikovsky added that Apple actively co-operated with the FAS during the investigation and that they ensured that all the “necessary measures to eliminate violations of the law” had been taken.

A fishing fundraiser for the nonprofit lake will be held April 8. COUNTY Metra surveying public about fare option ideas Metra is asking customers, former customers and prospective customers what they think about a variety of potential fare and ticket options, including off-peak and reverse-commute pricing, one-day and seven-day passes, loyalty programs and other ideas. The survey, available online, is part of a study that Metra commissioned to evaluate the agency’s distance-based fare structure and fare products and recommend changes that best serve the region’s needs. The scope of work for Metra’s consultant, Four Nines Technologies, includes determining opportunities and costs of potential fare structure changes and developing a model that can help Metra evaluate those potential changes. The survey is available at metra.com through March 31.  The survey asks respondents for information about commuting habits before asking for opinions about a variety of potential changes. Those include: Their likelihood of buying a one-day pass that would allow them to make round trips, transfer between lines and make unlimited trips inbound and outbound during one day on all lines in their zone pair, similar to a Monthly Pass. Their likelihood of buying a seven-day or weekly pass priced at eight one-way tickets and valid Monday through Sunday, instead of a 10-Ride Ticket. Their likelihood of using a Weekend Pass with extended hours to include Friday evening trains. Their likelihood of switching travel times if Metra offered a lower            fare on weekdays for trains that arrive downtown after 9:30 a.m. and leave downtown before 3 p.m. or after 7 p.m. Whether lower fares for reverse-commutes, travel between non-downtown stations and travel during off-peak hours would encourage them to ride Metra. (It also asks respondents to suggest the level of discount that would motivate their change in travel patterns.) Their likelihood of using Metra more if it offered some kind of loyalty program. The survey also asks about the ease of understanding Metra’s Ventra App and zone-based fares, and allows respondents to provide additional comments about current fares and how they might be improved to meet their needs. The survey results will be used to guide Metra’s decision-making regarding changes to fares and fare policies. Any proposed changes would be subject to further public comment before being implemented. The study is expected to be completed this summer.

ITProPortal Search RSS News Features Analysis Guides Reviews Categories Business Hardware Security Software Mobile Enterprise Cloud Networks Public Sector Startups Web Google's rivals lend a hand in its fight against the FBI By Anthony Spadafora News  Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Cisco have joined forces to support Google in its case over foreign emails. Shares Following a ruling by a Pennsylvania court that Google would have to turn over emails stored overseas, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Cisco have come together to file an amicus brief in support of the company.  Filing an amicus brief is a way in which companies or people not directly involved in a case can show their interest in it to a court.  In this situation, it is in the best interest of the companies that filed the brief that US law enforcement remains unable to access customer data that is currently stored outside of the US.  Although it is currently unclear as to what data Google may have to turn over to law enforcement, last month the company announced that it would fight the order.  In their amicus brief, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Cisco argued that the court's decision is an invasion of consumer privacy, saying:    “When a warrant seeks email content from a foreign data centre, that invasion of privacy occurs outside the United States – in the place where the customers' private communications are stored, and where they are accessed, and copied for the benefit of law enforcement, without the customer's consent.”  The court's decision could also encourage other countries to follow suit by demanding that they have access to the emails of US citizens.  The companies highlighted this point in their brief, saying: “Our sister nations clearly view US warrants directing service providers to access, copy, and transmit to the United States data stored on servers located within their territory as an extraterritorial act on the part of the US government.”  Google does plan to appeal the decision and we will certainly hear more once it does.  Image Credit: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock ABOUT THE AUTHOR Anthony Spadafora Anthony currently resides in South Korea where he teaches and experiences Korean technological advances first hand.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Business Image Source: Shutterstock Apple quietly hires renowned iPhone security expert Chris Mills @chrisfmills March 14th, 2017 at 9:34 PM Share Tweet In a blog post today, famous iPhone security expert Jonathan Zdziarski announced that he’s going to work for Apple. It’s an unusual announcement for a number of reasons — firstly, people don’t normally know or care who’s working on Apple’s security team — but Zdziarski is a little different. Don't Miss: Leaks reveal the 10 most exciting new features coming to Samsung’s Galaxy S8 Zdziarski is a prominent security consultant who’s also been a thorn in Apple’s side for years. Most notably, he’s called out Apple for shipping a version of iOS without an encrypted kernel, pulled apart Facebook’s iOS code to reveal “malware-like” code, and been a vital source of information during Apple’s short war with the FBI. In his blog post, Zdziarski briefly summarized his reasons for the move: I’m pleased to announce that I’ve accepted a position with Apple’s Security Engineering and Architecture team, and am very excited to be working with a group of like minded individuals so passionate about protecting the security and privacy of others. This decision marks the conclusion of what I feel has been a matter of conscience for me over time. Privacy is sacred; our digital lives can reveal so much about us – our interests, our deepest thoughts, and even who we love. I am thrilled to be working with such an exceptional group of people who share a passion to protect that. Zdziarski has long been an advocate for customer privacy and strong encryption. Apple’s hiring move is likely just a coincidence, a case of a company picking up a talented employee where possible. But in the current climate, going and finding a security engineer who is also well known for his ethical stance on hacking certainly sounds like a message.

TSMC won all of Apple’s business for the A-series chips used in the iPhone 6 and iPhone 7, and is reported to be the exclusive supplier for the 10nm A11 chip destined for the iPhone 8. But it seems Samsung hasn’t yet given up hope of winning future business from Apple. Korea’s ET News reports that the company is accelerating plans for 7nm chips in the hopes that these might be used for next year’s iPhones … Anker braided Lightning cables It is going to make supplemental investments into its 10-nano production lines in next month and construct new 7-nano semiconductor facilities in 2018. Its strategy is to secure ultra-fine processing technologies faster than its competitors. Samsung Electronics is expecting that it can recover Apple’s foundry supplies that were taken by Taiwan’s TSMC by operating 7-nano production lines early. The company is, however, likely to face an uphill battle on three fronts. First, the last time Apple bought A-series chips from Samsung was for the iPhone 6s, when it split orders between TSMC and Samsung. That didn’t seem to work too well, when iPhones with the Samsung chip were shown to run hotter and offer poorer battery life than the same models fitted with TSMC chips. Second, Samsung’s manufacturing reputation hasn’t exactly been enhanced by the Galaxy Note 7 disaster, where a series of fires and explosions in both original and replacement models saw the company first recall and later entirely abandon the product. Third, while Samsung is working on 10nm and 7nm processes, TSMC is already planning a new plant to create 5mn and 3nm chips. It’s believed that it is TSMC’s technical lead that has repeatedly led to it being selected as Apple’s sole supplier. TSMC last year reported record profits and share price thanks to its sole supplier status for the A10 chip. Further bad news for Samsung could come in the form of a partnership between Foxconn and TSMC to bid for shares of Toshiba’s flash storage business – a product line in which Samsung remains an Apple supplier.

The country's Federal Antimonopoly Service announced the decision in a press release today. The investigation revealed that from the start of official sales in Russia of the Apple iPhone 5s, iPhone 5c, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, most resellers installed the same prices on them, recommended by Apple Rus, and supported them For about 3 months. At the same time, Apple Rus monitored retail prices for Apple iPhone smartphones installed by resellers in online stores and retail outlets, and, in case of setting "unsuitable" prices, the Russian subsidiary Apple sent emails to resellers with a request to change them. Also, compliance with recommended retail prices by resellers could be due to the provisions of contracts between Apple Rus and resellers, which could be terminated by Apple Rus at any time without explanation. Notably, Apple Russia actively cooperated with FAS during the case and took the necessary measures to eliminate violations of the law and pursued a policy of preventing such violations in the future. The Financial Times says Apple has three months to appeal. If it fails to reverse the ruling it could be fined up to 15% of sales.

Slim and stylish laptops will ensure that work isn’t boring anymore Subscribe to our newsletter. Vishal Mathur At 13.1mm thick, and with a 12-inch Retina Display, Apple MacBook has a very compact footprint. Laptops have changed considerably, in the face of competition from the slimmer, lighter and more flexible convertible computing devices. From the look that resembled a thick black brick, and weighed what felt like a tonne, laptops have undergone a complete makeover. The recent crop of premium laptops focus on an ultra-slim form factor, without sacrificing on the looks, specifications or performance. We pick out the best options that you should consider, if budget is no bar. Apple MacBook Rs1,12,900 onwards At 13.1mm thick, and with a 12-inch Retina Display, the MacBook has a very compact footprint. It is available in silver, gold, space grey and rose gold colour options, giving you the option of colour-coordinating IT with your iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch. The Force Touch touchpad can detect differing pressures of the finger touch, and can execute certain functions in some apps. This was one of the first laptops to adopt the USB Type-C standard, and the removal of the USB ports, as we knew them, helped in the thickness reduction. You can get as much as 12 hours of battery life from the MacBook. If you go for the higher spec but marginally thicker MacBook Pro Touch Bar variants, you’ll also get the secondary touch display which sits above the keyboard and shows options and menus relevant to the app on the screen at that time. Dressed in Gold, LG Gram is just 13.4mm thick and weighs 980kg. LG Gram Rs94,900 Dressed in Gold, the Gram is just 13.4mm thick and weighs 980kg. The Carbon Magnesium Alloy chassis should hold it in good stead against the most established rivals. It runs the Intel Core i5-6200U processor, with 8GB RAM and a 256GB solid state drive. It runs Windows 10. The 14-inch display should do well, with the IPS technology that helps reproduce rich and accurate colours—the visual highlight is the 0.26mm measuring slim bezel around the display. It also has the Instant Booting feature, which switches on the laptop and boots into Windows, the moment you open the lid—this is something even the latest generation Apple MacBook Pro machines have. The Reading Mode reduces the blue light impact on the eyes, and makes reading more comfortable. HP Spectre 13 is incredibly thin, measuring just 10.4mm thick. HP Spectre 13 Rs1,10,290 onwards There is no denying the sheer sexiness of the Spectre 13’s design. It is incredibly thin, measuring just 10.4mm thick. The piston-hinge design element stands out, and so does the dash of black and gold colour. Within this aluminium and carbon-fiber chassis are the latest generation Intel Core i5 and Intel Core i7 processor options, 8GB RAM, Windows 10 and 13.3-inch display. The Spectre 13’s battery lasts around 6 hours for most usage scenarios, which while not at the same levels as the Apple MacBooks, is still among the better figures in the Windows genre. Asus Swift 7 is the slimmest of them all—measuring just 10mm in thickness—and has rather understated looks and colour options. Asus Swift 7 Rs99,990 This is the slimmest of them all—measuring just 10mm in thickness—and has rather understated looks and colour options. The other specs include an Intel Core i5-7Y54 processor, with 8 GB of RAM, 13-inch display and a 256 GB solid state drive (SSD) storage. If you aren’t extra careful with the brightness levels of the display, the battery life does suffer a bit—it lasts around 3.5 hours when stressed a bit, but that is the compromise for an ultra-thin form factor. Dressed in black, Razer Blade Stealth is just 13mm thick, yet doesn’t fall short in terms of power. Razer Blade Stealth $899.99 onwards (shipping extra) Razer is better known for gaming accessories, but the Blade Stealth is an ultrabook that cannot be ignored. Dressed in black, it is just 13mm thick, yet doesn’t fall short in terms of power—available with the options of 7th Gen Intel Core i5-7200U and the Core i7-7500U processor options, with 8GB or 16GB RAM options and a 12.5-inch display. You will get Windows 10 preloaded and up to 1TB SSD storage options. The ideal laptop to get, if you are travelling.

A good score is a must if you are trying to take out a loan or qualify for an apartment. Potential employers, business partners, corporations and the government use the scores, to make decisions and draw conclusions about you. Now, by lumping together populations of entire towns and cities, anyone can make broad judgments about the financial habits of strangers. A new analysis by WalletHub, the first website to offer free credit scores and full credit reports updated on a daily basis, compares the average credit scores of residents in more than 2,000 U.S. cities, telling the public which city has residents with the best financial habits. Wallethub used October 2016 data from TransUnion, a credit reporting agency, to make the comparisons. Several communities on Chicago’s North Shore made it into the top 100 across the country, including other Chicago area communities. According to Wallethub, the highest credit scores in Illinois are as follows: Wilmette, average credit score: 744.93, 99th percentile, 14th in nation Lake Forest, average credit score: 738.91, 99th percentile, 30th in nation Northbrook, average credit score: 739.38, 99th percentile, 34th in nation Deerfield, average credit score: 736.15, 98th percentile, 55th in nation Huntley, average credit score: 735.32, 98th percentile, 58th in nation Libertyville, average credit score 734.89, 98th percentile, 61st in nation Glenview, average credit score: 733.74, 97th percentile, 71st in nation Highland Park, average credit score 731.84, 96th percentile, 93rd in nation Park Ridge, average credit score 729.37, 96th percentile, 108th in nation Buffalo Grove, average credit score 727.89, 95th percentile, 125th in nation   Tagged with: chronicle media Chronicleillinois.com chroniclemedia.com Illinois Lake County Chronicle Suburban Chronicle suburbanchronicle.com Surburban Ad 1 – 300×250 – Google ROS Ad 2 – 300×250 – Medianet ROS Contact Us Advertise with Us Find a Copy Legal Notices Privacy Policy Copyright © Chronicle Media, LLC.

The ruling followed a seven-month investigation, which eventually concluded Apple’s Russian subsidiary had ordered resellers to abide by a certain price-structure for its smartphones. According to a statement from the FAS, Apple instructed numerous sellers to set prices at a certain level, and subsequently contacted those that didn’t comply to request they reconsider. The price-fixing allegedly goes back several years and spans the majority of recent smartphone models. The watchdog stated: “The investigation revealed that since the start of official sales in Russia of the Apple iPhone 5s, iPhone 5c, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, most resellers installed the same prices on them as recommended by Apple Rus and supported them for about three months.” Apple has a short time to appeal the ruling, but could face a fine of up to 15 percent of its Russian sales The statement further suggested Apple ensured compliance by threatening to terminate contracts with resellers that deviated from the set price-structure. As reported by Reuters, Apple’s press office immediately refuted the claims after they surfaced in August: “Resellers set their own prices for the Apple products they sell in Russia and around the world.” Apple has yet to officially comment on the ruling, but the FAS Deputy Head stated the company had “actively co-operated” with authorities throughout the investigation. He said: “The company has adopted the necessary measures to eliminate violations of the law and is pursuing a policy to prevent similar violations in the future.” The company now has a short time to build a defence and appeal the ruling, but could face a fine of up to 15 percent of its Russian sales. A recent FAS ruling against Google proves ominous for Apple. Last year, the competition watchdog fined Google $6.8m for illegally suppressing rival apps on its devices. According to the FAS, this sum was somewhere between one and 15 per cent of Google’s Russian earnings from mobile sales in 2014.

The Federal Anti-Monopoly Service (Fas) said that Apple's local subsidiary told 16 retailers to maintain the recommended prices of phones in the iPhone 5 and iPhone 6 families. Non-compliance with the pricing guidelines may have led to the termination of contracts, it found. Apple has not yet responded to a request for comment. At the time of the investigation, Apple denied that it controlled its products' pricing, telling Reuters that resellers "set their own prices for the Apple products they sell in Russia and around the world". The regulator said Apple had now ended its price-fixing practices but has not said whether the company faces a fine. The FAS claimed that Apple Rus monitored the retail prices for the iPhone 5c, 5s, 6, 6 Plus, 6s and 6s Plus. "In the case of the establishment of 'inappropriate' prices, the Russian subsidiary of Apple sent emails to resellers asking them to change," the watchdog said. The deputy head of the FAS, Andrey Tsarikovsky, added that "Apple actively co-operated" with the investigation and that the company had "adopted the necessary measures to eliminate violations of the law". That included training employees in the "anti-monopoly legislation norms" in Russia. In May, the FAS found that Google used its dominant position to force its own apps and services on users and fined it £5m ($6m). And, in November, the regulator opened an investigation into whether Microsoft abused its position in the security market with Windows 10, following a complaint from Moscow-based anti-virus firm Kaspersky.

While the current version, iOS 10.3, is now in beta, the upcoming iOS 11 is now under development. The new iOS is almost near its completion. In fact, it has been discovered that Apple is already testing the new iOS within its Cupertino headquarters. While this may sound good, quite sadly, iOS 11 could potentially bring an end to about 200,000 apps on the Apple App Store. According to a report by Mashable, nearly 200,000 apps will become obsolete once the iOS 11 is released. This is because these applications are not compatible with the upcoming 64-bit operating system. For years, Apple has urged its developers to start using the 64-bit designs on their apps. However, it seems like not all of them listened. In the latest beta version of the iOS, users are being warned if their apps are showing signs of incompatibility. The current beta version, iOS 10.3, is now being tested by participants of Apple’s beta testing program. Some of them have reported that some of the applications get notifications of incompatibility with future iOS versions. Apple App Store (via apple.com) Perhaps the problem lies with the implementation. When Apple introduced the 64-bit iOS back in 2013, it did not require developers to use 64-bit designs. That came through a few years later when Apple started nagging app developers to adopt the new structure. However, adoption has been slow on the part of developers. This in turn forces Apple to implement a system-wide update on the iOS 11. As mentioned, around 200,000 apps will be affected by the update. Whether or not these apps will get an update prior to the release of iOS 10, nobody really knows. However, some big developers have already started migrating to the new iOS design standards. At the moment, Apple is yet to comment on the official release of iOS 11. Right now, the company has been seen testing the new iOS version on new iPad Pro models. It is possible that it may get announced sometime in June this year for a possible release in September. For more updates on Apple iOS 11, be sure to check out TheBitbag.

The on-going battle over access to an individual’s personal data has been raging on for some time with various tech giants exchanging blows with the US government and its intelligence agencies. Most recently, Google has been ordered by US Magistrate Judge Thomas Rueter to share information with intelligence agencies, irrelevant to the fact it is stored in a non-US data centre, which has riled the tech industry’s army of lawyers. This latest development sees Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and Cisco file an amicus brief, a document filed by people or companies who have an interest in the case, but aren’t directly involved, to support Google’s resistance. Google has taken over as the target of the US DoJ, after Microsoft took flak last year, but support of some of the worlds’ most powerful organizations will be welcomed, as the battle to ensure data privacy rages on. The basic argument taken from the amicus brief is focused on The Stored Communications Act (SCA), the piece of legislation on which the US government’s argument is built upon. The filing claims the SCA does not authorize warrants for seizure of private emails stored in a foreign country. “The Government agrees that the SCA gives no such indication, and so does not extend extraterritorially,” the brief states. “Simply put, nothing in the SCA purports to regulate or protect in any way private communications stored overseas. The question here, then, is whether forcing a provider to execute a warrant in another country constitutes an extraterritorial application of the SCA.” This in itself is one of the main problems with the legislation underpinning data protection and privacy in the US; the SCA was initially written in 1986, with current rulings driven by case law and court interpretation. Yes, there have been amendments, most recently The USA Patriot Act, but the foundation of the law was written years prior to the mass penetration of the internet and cloud computing. Numerous critics have attacked the legislation on the ground it was adequately written to accommodate the development and acceleration of technology, and well as the fundamental importance of the digital economy. The document actually claims to have a huge amount of support as the industry hits back at greedy government fingers. Aside from the five tech heavy weights, support is also counted from 28 technology and media companies, 23 trade associations and advocacy groups, 35 of the nation’s leading computer scientists, and the Republic of Ireland. While it isn’t 100% clear what data Google would have to hand over following the ruling, the advertising giant has vowed to fight the order. The support of often feuding competitors just shows how important countering intelligence agencies influence is to Silicon Valley, as well as other nations around the world. “Our sister nations clearly view US warrants directing service providers to access, copy, and transmit to the United States data stored on servers located within their territory as an extraterritorial act on the part of the US government,” the brief states. “Indeed, they view this as an affront to their sovereignty in much the same way that physically conducting law enforcement activity on foreign soil would violate their sovereignty and territorial integrity.” The end of this highly controversial argument is unlikely to come at any point in the near future, though the ripples of consequence could be wide-ranging and violent. Should the DoJ be victorious in its cause, US intelligence agencies would be in a solid position to force US cloud companies to hand over data in a variety of circumstances. These companies would include AWS, Google, Microsoft and IBM. Together, all four now account for 63% of worldwide public IaaS and PaaS revenues. That’s a huge amount of information, on an astronomical number of people around the world. Governments should not be allowed to freely access this amount of information on foreign citizens, with what appears to be little justification or accountability. While there are likely to be data privacy advocates in these organizations, let’s not forget these are profit-driven machines. Yes, fighting the battle for the man on the street is a worthy cause, but the commercial consequences of losing this clash could be disastrous for Silicon Valley on the whole. Should the DoJ complete its quest, how many international companies would use a US cloud provider knowing the access US intelligence agencies have? The consequence could be a shift in cloud power away from Silicon Valley in an effort to ensure data sovereignty and boundaries. The stakes are certainly high in this game.

The ruling was first reported by the FT, but has also been published by the Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS). The Apple Rus subsidiary, says FAS, coerced the following resellers (according to Google Translate) to maintain the prices of a number of iPhone models at a specified level: MTS, M. Video, Beeline, Eldorado, Euroset , OZON, re: Store, Messenger, Megafon, Yulmart, Media Markt, Citylink, Holodilnik.ru, DNS, ION (know-how), Technosila. Apple is, of course, free to charge whatever it wants when selling directly and to charge whatever wholesale prices it wants. The issue lies with trying to coordinate pricing beyond its own operations – i.e. via resellers – and the FAS riling infers that Apple used the tacit threat of removing supply of iPhones to enforce its will. It also said that Apple cooperated with the investigation and has vowed to be good from now on. This ruling sets an interesting precedent. Price fixing among competitors is called a cartel and has been frowned upon at least since Adam Smith wrote “People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices,” in 1776. Suppliers can certainly recommend pricing but third parties should ultimately be free to charge what they want to their customers. We don’t know whether Apple operates in a similar manner in other markets but a look at Carphone Warehouse reveals it is offering a £20 discount on a SIM-free iPhone 7 (see screen grab below). We also don’t know whether this discount was pre-approved by Apple, but either way it implies some sale-price flexibility. Apple is notorious for wielding an iron grip over its supply chain all the way to the end-user. Current CEO Tim Cook is a supply chain guru, while Steve Jobs was fanatical about brand continuity and control in general. Apple makes far more margin than any other smartphone maker and if its customers are happy to pay that premium then good luck to them. But it shouldn’t be allowed to manipulate the third party market for its products so this ruling is correct.

We take a look at the all-new Apple TV Rating:  4 Typical Price:  £129.00 Pros:  Excellent SIri integration. She never misunderstands what I say. The app-based approach to television is a winner, even if it’s just a bit ahead of its time right now. A refreshing interface that is at once both new and familiar. Cons:  App Store discoverability is a mess. Search in general across tvOS can use a lot of improvement. Lack of dictation support is frustrating. Launch week apps and games leave something to be desired. Very few outstanding apps and games available right now. Verdict:  The new Apple TV is the best digital media player I’ve ever tried. That being said, it’s hindered by a lack of quality apps and games, and some frustrating search capabilities. However, all these problems are easily resolvable–and quickly. As the weeks go on more quality apps and games will be released as developers become more familiar with the new platform. Once that happens, the Apple TV is going to rule the market. facebook twitter google+ UPDATE: Apple’s tvOS 10.2 Beta Now Rolling Out Apple’s latest build for Apple TV is now rolling out. The new software is still in beta, but here’s what you can expect to find inside the tvOS 10.2 update: Accelerated Scrolling support for UIKit and TVMLKit apps Device Enrollment Program support Expanded Mobile Device Management support Support for the VideoToolbox framework Here’s what Apple said about the update back in December: “Watching TV has quickly become all about apps. And now, with the new TV app, you have one place to access shows and movies from multiple video apps — in one unified experience. The TV app lets you see all the movies and shows you’re watching. Find upcoming episodes. Get recommendations for new things to watch. See your entire iTunes video collection. You can even start watching a movie or show directly from the TV app. All without switching between individual apps.” ------------------------------------------------------------- When Apple unveiled the brand new Apple TV back in September I was incredibly excited. With its brand new OS, called tvOS, the Apple TV looked to be set to rightfully take its place alongside Apple’s staple iOS devices like the iPhone and iPad. Since it launched Apple’s developers have created over 5000 applications for the Apple TV store. That is a hugely impressive number when you consider the new Apple TV isn’t all that old, coming out just a few months ago.  During Apple’s 2016 Town Hall meeting Apple confirmed a bunch of new features, such as Siri for the App Store, so you can search with your voice for what you want, as well as things like Folders which can now be placed on the home screen.  Apple has plenty of competition in 2016’s market as well in the form of Google’s Chromecast 2, Amazon’s range of Fire TV devices and Roku’s myriad of options. The space is pretty well supplied but each solution tends to try and do something specific; Google’s does its Casting thing, while Apple TV is ALL about AirPlay and only really works with other Apple products like iPhones, iPads and Macs.   This means you NEED an Apple TV if you want to connect all of your iPhones, iPads and iMacs inside your home. It isn’t essential, obviously, but it is A LOT cheaper than buying an expensive, web-connected HDTV and it brings plenty of utility with it as well as tons of dedicated applications now that Apple has opened up the Apple TV platform to developers. Like most Apple products, the emphasis on Apple TV is simplicity: you connect it to your HDTV and your home WiFi network and you’re away. AirPlay works with the click of a button on iPhone, iPad and Mac and allows you to stream music, film and pictures around your home, between devices. As we move through 2016, Apple will almost certainly expand Apple TV’s features-set with software updates that’ll make it even more useful. HomeKit is one area where it could really come along in leaps and bounds. Now that I’ve been using the new Apple TV for almost a week, I’ve decided it's time to finally give it a super-fan’s honest review. What’s good? What’s bad? Here are my thoughts… 2015 Apple TV review: Specs and Design Okay, before I get to deconstructing the new Apple TV, first a rundown of its specs: Output: HDMI 1.4 Processor: Apple dual-core A8 chip RAM: 2 GB Storage: 32GB or 64GB Max. Output Video Resolution: 1080p Dimensions: 98(L) x 98(W) x 33(H) mm Weight: 425 g Connectivity: 10/100BASE‑T Ethernet, 802.11a/b/g/n/ac Wi‑Fi, Bluetooth 4.0 Other ports: IR receiver, USB-C (service only) Power: Built-in universal 6 W power supply I’m not going to spend a whole lot of time talking about its design. I mean, it’s a black box that sits below your television that you’re probably never going to pick up again. If you’re interested to see how its design compares to the old Apple TV design, check out my Verses article here. I will touch on a few things about the specs, however. First, it’s got a dual-core A8 chip inside–that’s the same chip found in the iPhone 6. It’s also got 2GB of RAM–the same amount found in the iPhone 6s. Combined, this internal power is more than enough to run any apps or games available for the new Apple TV. I’ll talk more about the quality of the games available for the Apple TV later, but know that even graphic-intensive games like Asphalt 8 run blazingly fast on the Apple TV. It’s also worth noting that there are two models of the Apple TV to choose from–32GB and 64GB. I opted for the 64GB version because I like getting enough storage. If you plan on downloading a lot of apps, specifically, games, then I recommend going for the 64GB model. If you’re mainly just going to be streaming video content, then the 32GB model is more than enough. Apple TV Review: Siri Remote So in all the marketing literature the new Siri Remote gets the lion’s share of attention. It’s a completely revamped remote from the previous one and, as you can guess from the name, features Siri integration. How it works is the remote has a dedicated Siri button. Press it and hold it and then speak your query and then release the button so Siri knows you’re ready for her to answer your question or carry out your command. The best features of the Siri Apple TV integration, for me, is for launching apps and videos. No matter where you are in tvOS, you can say things like “Launch Alto's Adventure” and Siri will open the game immediately. For this alone, Siri on the Apple TV is the best launcher out of any OS I’ve ever tried. You can also say things like “Play Episode 2 of Season 1 of Flash” and that episode of the Flash TV series will begin playing (if you’ve bought it). And if you don't know what you want to watch, you can even ask Siri things like “What should I watch tonight?” and she’ll display a list of the top rated movies available. Siri also has some nice tricks just beyond launching apps and videos. You can ask Siri about the weather and she’ll display a weather forecast. You can ask Siri the price of any stock and she’ll show you its chart. Sames goes for sport scores. Siri is also useful for search, which I’ll talk more about later one. I’ll just finish up here by saying that Apple has made Siri very useful, accurate, and quick on the new Apple TV. But besides Siri, the new Siri Remote is also a physical remote. It’s got both buttons and a touchpad. The touchpad is obviously new here too and it works exceedingly well. There’s about a five minute learning curve, but after that it becomes second nature using it and you don’t even need to look at the touchpad as you navigate around the interface of your Apple TV. A final thing about the remote–and this is awesome–is that it allows you to control your TV’s volume too. There are dedicated volume buttons on the remote and pressing them controls your TV’s volume, meaning you no longer need to use two remotes when using the Apple TV. It’s such a small feature but it really compliments the user experience. And somehow the remote just pairs with your television without you needing to make your TV learn that Siri Remote can control its volume. Apple TV Review: tvOS and Search The new Apple TV uses a brand new OS. It’s a cross between the old Apple TV OS and iOS. By that I mean, it looks very similar to the old Apple TV OS, except with a new skin on top. But underneath it's now more like iOS: it allows you to download and install new apps and games, has its own App Store, and has, as stated, Siri integration. But there’s not much of a learning curve, because it uses the familiar grid layout of the old Apple TV OS. Watching video is pretty much the same as it was on the old Apple TV, with some cool Siri upgrades however. For example, if you are watching a movie and you missed something an actor just said, you can ask Siri “What did he say?” and the movie will rewind to the start of the dialogue so you can hear it again–and even closed caption boxes will momentarily appear. This is in no doubt cool, but also kind of feels like a gimmick better suited for advertisements about the Apple TV. I don’t see many people using this feature regularly. ------------------------------------------------------------- UPDATE: Apple Confirms TV App – But No Netflix or Amazon Prime Video Apple announced its new TV App last night for Apple TV. The new application is designed to make consuming content from 1600 video content providers easier but there are two HUGE problems with this new initiative – Netflix and Amazon Prime Video are not included. Netflix will still be available as an app for Apple TV, as always, but Amazon is still missing from Apple’s device and it shows no sign of turning up any time soon. Amazon and Apple do not get along. Like, at all. Amazon even went as far as removing Apple TV and Chromecast from its retail site, which goes to show just how little the company thinks of its rivals. “Apple showed off lots of live streaming through the app,” notes WIRED, “including plentiful news and sports, most of those services require a cable log-in to authenticate. The TV app should help declutter, but not cord-cutters. Between that and the absence of two of the biggest streaming players, it’s maybe best to view it as an added convenience, but not a true TV replacement.” Looks like Apple’s plans for the TV space aren’t panning out quiet as well as the company had hoped. Still, at least you have the Netflix app to play with… Also: the new TV App will likely develop over the coming months and years, adding in new, unique content. Still, one can’t help but think that Apple came too late to the game which is now vastly different to what it was just a few years ago. Netflix and Amazon are moving towards original content, while Apple seems fixated on the old model of simply providing already-available content. This one’s going to take some time to develop properly, me thinks… ------------------------------------------------------------- Now where I have real issues with tvOS is in the search department–a major feature Apple has touted. Yes, you can search via Siri, which is really cool. You can say things like “Show me Brad Pitt movies” and Siri will return a list of results on screen. Then you can whittle down that list by saying “Only the good ones” and Siri will eliminate any Brad Pitt movies with low ratings. That is exceptionally cool. It’s even cooler when you consider that tvOS has universal search. That’s right: those searches just won’t show you results from the iTunes Store, but from any install apps on your Apple TV. That means you’ll see Brad Pitt movies from iTunes, but also the ones that are available on Netflix and other apps like HBO GO. So what’s the problem? The way the search results are displayed. They appear at a bar at the bottom of the screen and just by glancing at them you can’t see what app they are from–you need to click on them to see which app you can view them in. By default I think the iTunes Store results always appear first–and since iTunes pretty much has EVERY movie on the planet, that means you’re kind of always getting pushed into the iTunes Store to pay for movies that could be already free to view in other apps, like Netflix. tvOS has another problem related to search. Yes, you can search for things by typing in their name in a Search app, but the interface is poorly thought out. The keyboard appears in one long row from A to Z instead of being broken down into a more manageable three rows stacked on top of each other (or a QWERTY layout). This means to spell titles you have to do a lot of swiping with the trackpad. It’s also baffling that though you can use the Siri Remote to perform voice searches–and Siri understand me EXCELLENTLY every time–you can’t use the Siri Remote to dictate text. Yes, tvOS supports no dictation capabilities, even though iOS has supported it for a long time. I hope this will change in a future software update. The final thing I want to say about tvOS is just to give it a shout out to its screensavers. The new aerial motion video screensavers are beautiful. Apple TV review: App Store Yep, the new Apple TV has an App Store. It’s a great feature, but the actual App Store app is one of the weakest areas of the new Apple TV. It feels rushed and poorly thought out. Discovery is a nightmare. Matter of fact, when the Apple TV first shipped, the App Store lacked Top Charts of any kind. It STILL lacks categories. Thankfully, in the last day Apple has activated Top Charts, but with the lack of Categories it makes finding worthwhile apps hard–particularly because text search is as frustrating in the App Store as it is in the rest of tvOS. And bafflingly, Siri can’t be used to search the App Store either. That being said, when I first logged into the App Store I navigated to the Purchased tab and was pleasantly surprised to find I already had bought over 30 Apple TV apps. These are iOS apps that had been upgraded with universal support to take advantage of the Apple TV, so it was like I was getting new version of these old iOS apps for nothing. I mentioned that the App Store now at least shows Top Charts, but even navigating these lists are annoying. That’s because they display the apps in a linear order in a row from left to right across your TV screen. You need to do a TON of swiping to see all 200 apps in each chart. Instead, Apple should make the Top Chats appear in a grid layout so you can see dozens of apps at a time. The App Store is the weakest part of the new tvOS experience. It can be helped immensely by improved search and categories. It would also be helpful it the App Stores on iOS and Mac and PC let you know which apps were universal and would also work on the Apple TV. Apple TV Review: Apps The Apple TV is a new platform for developers, so it goes without saying that the amount and quality of apps will increase over time as developers get more familiar with the platform. Right now there aren’t a lot of great apps on the Apple TV, but this can change very, very quickly. The best apps (this doesn’t include games) tend to be video content apps: Netflix, HBO Go, YouTube, Sky News, Aljazeera. These are more traditional “channel” apps. Then there are content apps that do a great job melding video and other content together, like the Fidelity Investment app which shows live streaming video next to interactive charts and other news sources. There’s a lot of weather apps that are pretty useful and then there are apps from places like AirBnb, which are nice, but arguably not that useful. However, a majority of the apps are of the “download, open once, delete” quality. Yes, this will change, as time goes on. Remember, developers are still adjusting to the new platform. Apple TV Review: Games Games are another big feature of the Apple TV. Like apps, there’s a few great ones, but most are just iOS ports that translate only OK to the big screen, and many just outright suck. The best of the best are games like Alto's Adventure, which translate perfectly from iOS to the television screen. But then there are many games that were brought over from iOS just because they could be. And one thing which is really hindering good gaming on the Apple TV is that Apple requires that all games must work with the Siri Remote. Even though the Apple TV supports gamepads, a game cannot dictate that a gamepad is a must. This greatly limits the type and quality of games that developers can make for the Apple TV. One hopes that Apple reverses this decision soon. Apple TV review: Cost & Verdict The new Apple TV is the best Apple TV Apple has ever made. It’s also the best digital media player on the market. That being said, it’s a brand new device that is negatively affected by some launch-day hiccups. The lack of Categories in the App Store makes app and game discovery difficult. Video search can also be greatly improved so it's easier to see what apps the movies and television shows are located in. It would also be nice if you could limit search results to show only content that was watchable for free (instead of all the content available to buy on iTunes). The Apple TV is also limited by the lack of quality apps and games at the moment. However, this will change quickly (probably by Christmas). As the weeks go on, more and more quality apps and games will be released–these include apps like BBC iPlayer, which will be available on the Apple TV for the first time ever in the near future. All that being said, I think the new Apple TV is a must have device if you are firmly entrenched in the iOS ecosystem. It is a killer leisure device with a great remote control and a lot of potential in front of it. All the drawbacks it has right now are currently software based, so they can all be addressed by free software updates in the future. But there’s little reason to wait for those updates if you are really into watching on demand content–especially if you were a fan of the old Apple TV, which just looks positively outdated now. Apple is onto something with the new Apple TV and I can’t wait to see how it evolves over the coming weeks and months. The 32GB Apple TV costs £129 and the 64GB Apple TV costs £169. Both models are available now.

Video Mingis on Tech: A Madcap Mobile World Congress recap Some iPhone enthusiasts have a secret -- they would really also like to have an Android phone.  That is what a new Kickstarter is banking on. A new campaign on the crowdfunding site is promising an iPhone accessory that brings Android to your Apple device, in a manner of speaking. Will it be enough to calm the Apple/Android rivalry? In IT Blogwatch, we accessorize.  So what is going on? Chris Smith gives us some background: Ever wished you could run Android on your iPhone? Well, it’s finally possible, and it doesn’t require any jailbreaks or other complicated hacks...The bad news is that it’s still not the solution you might be looking for, it costs a pretty penny...and you have to wait at least until August to get it. That doesn't really clear things up. Luckily, Scott Stein has some more information: The Esti Eye is the latest accessory oddity to hit Kickstarter...Really, it's an Android phone. It just happens to snap onto the back of an iPhone. ... The Esti Eye has a second screen, which you look at when you're not looking at your iPhone screen...It's either a fantasy or a monstrosity. So it's an iPhone case that sports Android? Is there a real need for that? Michelle Jones is in the know: We were skeptical that there would be...demand for such a case, but apparently, there is. The Kickstarter project...began with a...goal of $95,000, and it’s already raised nearly $133,000, with 31 days yet to go. ... Other than the cash you’ll have to shell out for the case, the price of bringing Android to the iPhone...is having a bulkier phone...Early bird who buy the case through the Kickstarter project can pick it up for $95, although cases that support 4G cost a little more. I guess there is a need, then. So what does it do? Shawn Knight has the details: It features a 5-in., always-on FHD AMOLED display, two SIM card slots, a microSD card that supports up to 256GB of storage, a...2,800mAh battery, Qi wireless charging, NFC, infrared and a 3.5mm headphone jack. ... The case connects to the iPhone via the Lightning port which is said to offer transfer speeds up to 130MB per second...it runs Android 7.1 Nougat on its own chipset although details on said chipset weren’t provided. What else should we know? And will it work with all iPhones? Kyle Wiggers fills in the blanks: An infrared blaster lets you control home appliances like TVs, set-top boxes, and stereo systems with a compatible app...the Eye...has...an estimated later retail price of $190...It comes in black and white, and fits the iPhone 6, 6 Plus, 6S, 6S Plus, 7, and 7 Plus. Wait, isn't a new iPhone coming out this year? Will it fit that? We go to the Kickstarter FAQ to to get answers: The next iPhone will be supported a month after its launch...An option to wait until...[the] next iPhone is out will be given to backers. So is it worth getting this case? Juli Clover makes a suggestion: While the Eye case looks intriguing, it also looks too good to be true...Esti is a first time Kickstarter company and a project this ambitious...will almost certainly run into problems with mass production. ... The Kickstarter campaign says the first units will deliver in August of 2017, a timeline that's likely going to be difficult to meet...if you're interested in this product, it may be better to hold off until it is available outside of Kickstarter. Despite the Kickstarter enthusiasm, some people are still skeptical. Bobbo sums it up nicely: Because people always wanted a Android phone as an iPhone case!

NEWS REVIEWS FEATURES WIN NEWSLETTER PHOTO AWARDS NEWS REVIEWS FEATURES WIN NEWSLETTER PHOTO AWARDS Search for: Google Pixel 2: Everything we know so far UPDATE 15:03: Codenames spotted – Can second time be the charm for Google’s flashy flagship? 15 March 2017 by Stuff Staff The Pixel was Google’s first internally-designed handset, and it got a lot of things right: the camera is amazing, it had the first crack at Android Nougat, and came with an Apple-like polish. Unfortunately, it also had an uninspired design, a very hefty price, and some component trade-offs compared to its top-end Android rivals. It was a strong first effort, though. Apple’s devices usually get significant improvements and refinements on the second go-round, and we’re expect much the same with Google’s iPhone-esque take on Android. Leaks and rumours are starting to trickle in ahead of an expected release later this year, and the upgrades sound promising. Here’s what we’ve heard so far. WHAT WE KNOW >>> Work is well underway Google doesn’t like to talk about upcoming hardware ahead of launch, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t clues to spot if you do some digging around online. The Android Open Source Project collaboration page is usually a good start, and has thrown up two codenames: “walleye” and “muskie”. Those are both fish, which match with Google’s choice of pre-release names for the Pixel and Pixel XL – Marlin and Sailfish. >>> It should be waterproof The iPhone 7 and Samsung’s Galaxy S7 both embraced waterproofing, which is quickly becoming the standard for pricier flagships, but the Google Pixel opted not to implement it in the first model. Luckily, sources say that water and dust resistance are likely to be included with the Pixel 2. >>> The camera may improve The Pixel and Pixel XL already have one of the absolute best smartphone cameras on the market today, but unsurprisingly, Google plans to keep pushing the tech for the next round. A report claims that we won’t see a big megapixel bump (from 12.3MP), but that the Pixel 2 should have even better low-light performance and other feature enhancements. >>> It might cost more money This one’s a surprise, given the already-high price of the Pixel and some missing perks compared to other Android flagships, but 9to5Google says that Google expects the Pixel 2 to cost “at least” US$50 more than the original phone at launch (US$649 in the States). We had better see some significant feature additions to justify that jump. >>> Snapdragon-powered Google went with the top-of-the-line Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 for the first Pixel, and it sounds like that trend may continue for the next one. A processor in the Snapdragon 830 line is expected, perhaps the powerful Snapdragon 835, although a report claims that Google has also tested out Intel chips, as well as custom chipsets. >>> No headphone jack? Surprise! Apple might not be the only big name looking to end the life of the humble headphone jack. Google could be planning a similar move, according to the latest leaked insider info. >>> Launching with Android O With the Pixel replacing the old Nexus line, the devices have become the vanguard for the latest and greatest versions of Android. And just as the Pixel was the first phone with the full release version of Android Nougat, we’ll probably see the Pixel 2 launch with Android O (8.0) out of the box. >>> There might be a cheaper one Remember the part above about the Pixel 2 being more expensive than the original? While that has been reported, so too has the existence of a cheaper, cut-rate Pixel. We’d expect something smaller and mid-range to compete with the likes of the OnePlus 3T, but unfortunately there aren’t any hard details at this point. Still, that’s a promising tidbit. >>> No word on the XL None of the reports so far mention a Pixel 2 XL to follow in the footsteps of the original plus-sized model, but we would be surprised to see Google drop it. The first Pixel XL has been consistently hard to find, and given the popularity of Apple’s iPhone 7 Plus as well, there’s definitely demand for bigger, feature-boosted options. >>> We’ll probably see it this autumn Google unveiled the first Pixel in early October 2016 and released it a couple weeks later, and there’s little reason to believe that the company will jump the gun with a sequel. Debuting it around the same time will give Google another chance to try and play off of the next iPhone announcement… and hopefully not look too much like a copy of it again. Senior VP of hardware Rick Osterloh confirmed as much at Mobile World Congress, saying that Google would be sticking to the mobile industry’s annual cycle for new releases. ALL THE LATEST NEWS >>> 15 March 2017 The Android Open Source Project collaboration page threw up two codenames, which are likely the Pixel 2 and Pixel XL 2. Muskie and Walleye are both fish, which lines up with the old codenames for the Pixel and Pixel XL. That means Google is well and truly underway in developing their respective replacements. >>> 07 March 2017 A report from 9to5Google suggested that Google may be looking to follow in Apple’s footsteps and ditch the headphone jack with the Pixel 2. This would be a huge step, as few other Android phones (from big-name brands here in the UK, at least) have taken the leap. HTC has done it, though, and seeing how it was responsible for building the original Pixel, there could be a grain of truth here. >>> 02 March 2017 News filtered out of Barcelona’s Mobile World Congress show this week, with Google’s Senior VP of hardware Rick Osterloh confirming the Pixel 2 was real, and that it would be arriving at some point this year. “There is an annual rhythm in the industry. So, you can count on us to follow it. You can count on a successor this year, even if you don’t hear a date from me now.” AndroidPit also managed to get him to say that the Pixel’s successor would “stay premium”. >>> 26 January 2017 9to5Google has a big report out today, citing a previously reliable source who has purported leaked details on the Pixel 2. The source claims that waterproofing is on the table as a feature, that the camera will see low-light improvements (and maybe more), that a cheaper version is also in the works, and that the main model will probably see a price bump.

Countless iOS users enjoy Google’s services on their iPhones, and in fact, the acclaimed Gboard keyboard actually began its life as an iOS exclusive before making its way to the Play Store several months later. But while Apple hasn’t been nearly as generous with its offerings, it does offer Apple Music and Beats Pill as a concession to former Beats Music subscribers. However, there’s a load of untapped potential in the Play Store. After all, Apple doesn’t just sell iPhones, and many Android users have other Cupertino-made products that they use on a regular basis. So here are some Apple apps I’d love to see show up in the Play Store: AirPort utility Greenbot The Airport Utility app on iOS lets you control your routers wright from your iPhone. Apple’s routers may be getting a bit long in the tooth, but they’re still kicking around, and require very little set-up and barely any maintenance. However, they aren’t foolproof, and for those times when they need to be reset, Apple offers a handy AirPort Utility app for iOS that lets you manage your networks and base stations. It’s not the most powerful tool, but it will solve most problems, and it would be helpful to be able to update firmware, tweak settings, and renew DHCP leases from our Android phones. Remote Greenbot With the Remote app, you don’t have to struggle with picking up your Apple TV remote from the wrong end. Apple TV is a fantastic digital media receiver with one major shortcoming: Its bundled remote is pretty awful. Whether we’re holding it wrong, struggling to enter lengthy passwords, or just forgetting to charge it, more often than not we’re turning to the Remote app to find something to watch. But if you have an Android phone, you’re out of luck. And it doesn’t make much sense. You don’t really need to be fully invested in the Apple ecosystem to buy an Apple TV, so why not throw Android users a bone here? It would make for a better experience and might even boost sales. TV Greenbot The TV app keeps all of your iTunes purchases under one roof. Speaking of Apple TV, there’s another app that many Android users would rush to download: TV. While its primary home is on Apple’s set-top box, on the iPhone it’s a one-stop entertainment shop, with access to all of the movies and videos you’ve purchased through iTunes. As it stands, there’s no easy way to watch your DRM-locked iTunes moves and TV shows on an Android device without going through a tedious conversion process. A TV app would save us the trouble.  iCloud Drive Greenbot There’s no reason why iCloud Drive needs to stay locked to the Apple ecosystem. Over the past few version of iOS, iCloud Drive has transformed from a behind-the-scenes file manager into a full-fledged storage locker, letting us transfer files between our iPhones, iPads, and Macs with ease. But when we need to go outside the Apple ecosystem, our iCloud Drives are useless. Every other service works across platforms—Google Drive, Dropbox, Microsoft OneDrive—but Apple still stubbornly makes us jump through hoops to get our iCloud files onto an Android phone. An iCloud Drive app in the Play Store would make it much more useful—and might even give us a reason to pay for extra storage. Facetime Greenbot FaceTime was supposed to be an open standard, but it’s still locked to Apple devices. When Steve Jobs demoed FaceTime at the iPhone 4 event, he promised Apple was “going to the standards bodies, starting tomorrow, and we’re going to make FaceTime an open industry standard.” As we all know, that never happened, and FaceTime remains an exclusive Apple feature. But while Android users are still trying to convince their Apple friends to download Duo, a better solution would be for Apple to make good on its promise and open up FaceTime. Or just release its own version in the Play Store. Messages Greenbot Messages would be as great on Android as it is on iOS. Now, I understand all of the reasons why Apple wouldn’t want to release Messages for the Play Store, but here’s one why it should: spite. Google has struggled mightily to create a uniform messaging system on Android, and with one fell swoop, Apple could undermine their entire effort with any app that not only syncs across all Android phones but also works across all Apple devices, too. If Apple wants to keep some of the cooler features like apps and stickers exclusive to the iOS version that’s fine, but even the staunchest iPhone haters would appreciate a combination SMS and over-the-top messaging app on Android that just works.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Kantar: Apple's iOS Achieved Continued Growth Across most Major Regions while Nokia's Comeback Could Impact Europe | Main | New Study Covers Current and Future Trends in Smartphones, Digital Assistants, Wearables and More » March 15, 2017 Apple & Samsung will own 83.33% of the OLED Display Market in 2017 while Samsung Races to 7nm Chips to Win Apple Back   Two interesting reports surfaced this morning in Asia that are worth noting. In the first report we lean that Samsung Display will produce an estimated 300 million AMOLED smartphone panels in 2017. After priority supply for Samsung Electronics and Apple, Samsung Display can supply only about 50 million AMOLED panels for China-based smartphone vendors this year for Huawei, Oppo and Vivo combined. Consequently, global supply of AMOLED panels will be short of demand for all of 2017. Apple and Samsung will account for 83.33% of the AMOLED panel market this year.   In a second report we learn that Samsung Electronics is going to invest US$6.98 billion (8 trillion KRW) to extend high-tech system semiconductor production lines. It is going to make supplemental investments into its 10-nano production lines in next month and construct new 7-nano semiconductor facilities in 2018.   Its strategy is to secure ultra-fine processing technologies faster than its competitors. Samsung Electronics is expecting that it can recover Apple's foundry supplies that were taken by Taiwan's TSMC by operating 7-nano production lines early and this will also benefit equipment manufacturers.   A Samsung representative stated added that "It is true that investments into 10-nano semiconductors have reduced compared to its initial plan as TSMC took supplies of Apple's latest AP." Because of that loss, the rep further noted that Samsung Electronics is making swift actions as it has high expectations on markets for 7-nano chips that will be commercialized in 2018 and that the amount of investment can increase in the future if Samsung Electronics can land a contract with Apple to produce 7-nano chips.   But Samsung may be dreaming a little here as TSMC's road map for 7, 5 and 3nm chips is already underway. Back in December TSMC TSMC's CEO Mark Liu stated at their second quarter performance presentation back September stated that he believed that their 7nm chips will be superior to those from Samsung in PPA index that indicates Power, Performance, and Area.   Liu further noted that they're going to start on tape-out on 7-nano chips in first quarter of next year and start mass-production in early 2018. Whether that could mean the iPhone 9 could be the first to introduce this processor is unknown at this time.   In the end, Samsung would need a miracle chip with new capabilities or one at half price to entice Apple to swithch. But realistically, it's a very long shot that Samsung will be able to win back Apple anytime in the foreseeable future.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

It is an implementation of a resizable array with a range of useful methods for manipulating the array. In this article, we present some of the usage patterns of the ArrayList. The ArrayList is a concrete implementation of the List interface. As such, it is fine to refer to List instead of ArrayList when the implementation detail does not matter. The examples below use List instead of ArrayList when this difference is not relevant. Array vs. ArrayList A regular array in Java is a container which holds a fixed number of elements of a specific type. The following (stringArray) is a declaration of an array of String objects and is initialized to an array enough to store 20 strings. String[] stringArray = new String[20]; An ArrayList for storing Strings is defined as shown below. The number 20 is an indication to the ArrayList class to reserve enough space for 20 strings. ArrayList<String> stringList = new ArrayList<String>(20); Some of the differences between the two: Addition: The stringArray can store up to 20 strings. If you need to store more later on, you will have to re-initialize the array and copy the contents from the old array. With the ArrayList, you can add more than 20 strings without worrying about the capacity. Removal: With the ArrayList, it is easy to remove entries, either at a particular index or a range or a particular object. Not so easy with the array. You will need loops and other boiler-plate code to manage the removal in your code. Creating an ArrayList As already shown above you can create an ArrayList using the constructor. To create an empty ArrayList with a capacity for 10 Objects: ArrayList<Object> objArray = new ArrayList<>(); To create an ArrayList from another Collection such as a Set or a List, you can use: Set<String> stringSet = ..;
List<String> list = new ArrayList<String>(stringSet); What if you need to create a List from a bunch of objects already lying around in your code? You can use Arrays.asList() as follows: List<String> list = Arrays.asList("Apple", "Banana", "Orange"); The following selects lines from a text file using Java 8 streams. List<String> lines = Files
    .lines(Paths.get(textFile))
    .filter(x -> x.length() > 50)
    .collect(Collectors.toList()); Convert Array to ArrayList As presented above, it is simple to convert to a List if you have a plain array of objects. List<String> a = Arrays.asList(args); The above is suitable if you have an array of objects. What if you have an array of a primitive type, say an int? Here is how you can handle that case. int[] array = { 2, 4, 5 };
List<Integer> list = Arrays
    .stream(array)
    .boxed()
    .collect(Collectors.toList()); Convert ArrayList to Array The List interface provides a method toArray() which creates and returns a new array containing all the elements in the ArrayList. List<String> strList = ...;
String[] strArray = strList.toArray(); Add to ArrayList Use the method add() to add items to a List. This invocation adds elements at the end of the list. List<String> strList = new ArrayList<>();
strList.add("Apple");
strList.add("Banana");
strList.add("Orange");
strList.stream().forEach(System.out::println);

// prints
Apple
Banana
Orange To add all elements of a collection, use addAll(). List<String> modList = new ArrayList<>();
modList.addAll(strList);
modList.add("Melon"); UnsupportedOperationException The following code results in an UnsupportedOperationException. The reason is that Arrays.asList() returns a fixed sized list backed by the input array. So you cannot add elements to the List returned by Arrays.asList(). A simple solution is to create a new ArrayList from the original list as follows: List<String> strList = Arrays.asList("Apple", "Banana", "Orange");
List<String> modList = new ArrayList<>(strList);
modList.add("Melon"); Or you could use Java 8 streams: List<String> modList = strList
    .stream()
    .collect(Collectors.toList());
modList.add("Melon");
modList.stream().forEach(System.out::println);

// prints:
Apple
Banana
Orange
Melon Remove from ArrayList Removal of items from a List is also easy. Remove an element at a particular index. List<String> modList = new ArrayList<>();
modList.addAll(strList);
modList.add("Melon");
modList.remove(2);

// contains:
Apple
Banana
Melon Remove a particular object as shown below. Note: The equals() method is used for checking whether to remove the object. It works as shown for String. For another class, equals() might be defined in terms of memory addresses, in which case the same object instance must be passed in to remove it. List<String> modList = new ArrayList<>();
modList.addAll(strList);
modList.add("Melon");
modList.remove("Orange");

// contains
Apple
Banana
Melon What if you want to remove an object with some specific characteristic. Use the removeIf() method with the predicate. The methods removes all elements that match the predicate. List<String> modList = new ArrayList<>();
modList.addAll(strList);
modList.add("Melon");
modList.removeIf(x -> x.endsWith("e"));

// contains
Banana
Melon Remove all objects from one List that are found in another List using removeAll(). List<String> modList = new ArrayList<>();
modList.addAll(strList);
modList.add("Melon");
modList.removeAll(Arrays.asList("Banana", "Kiwi"));

// contains
Apple
Orange
Melon Summary This article explained Java arrays and ArrayList from the perspective of a beginner. We showed creation and initialization of ArrayList. The ArrayList provides a bunch of methods to add and remove elements from the list. In some cases, the List created may not be modifiable in which case an exception is thrown when you try to modify it.

(Photo: YouTube)  Share  Comments Get money updates directly to your inbox + Subscribe Thank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Almost half a million people had their phone stolen between April 2015 and March 2016, according to the latest crime figures, with the rates of theft twice as high for those aged between 18 and 24. Analysis of Metropolitan Police data covering 2015 by insurer Protect Your Bubble revealed that 59% of all phones stolen were iPhones. Interestingly, when a phone was targeted by thieves - so not not those taken while in handbags, cars or during burglaries - even though Apple was the most sought-after brand, certain models from other manufacturers were targeted more. The top models targeted by thieves HTC M8 Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge Apple iPhone 6 Plus Apple iPhone 6 Apple iPhone 6s Samsung Galaxy S6 Samsung Galaxy S5 Samsung Galaxy Note Apple iPhone 5C HTC One A number of high profile phones, like the iPhone 7, have been released since this data was collected which will likely be high up a thief’s wishlist too. Protecting your phone I know you really want that Pidgey, but you're advertising your phone to thieves! (Photo: Reuters) If a thief does manage to get their hands on your phone, then it can spell trouble, beyond merely the inconvenience of going silent in your WhatsApp groups. You may have all sorts of personal details on there, which could potentially open you up to identity theft - and that's not counting the number of shopping apps and sites that have your card details saved. So it’s a good idea to take some preventative measures to ensure that your phone is less likely to end up in someone else’s pocket. At the risk of pointing out the obvious, an excellent way of protecting your phone is simply keeping it out of sight. Don’t leave them unattended on tables in pubs and restaurants, or get them out unless necessary when you’re out and about. Read More What burglars want to take from you the most - and how to keep them at bay Keeping your phone zipped up in a bag or in pockets which don’t offer easy access to a pick-pocket is also a smart move. Avoiding drawing attention to your phone generally can pay dividends - if you go for a handset in a loud colour, or add a brightly coloured case to your handset, it is much more likely to catch the eye of an opportunistic thief. Rob Basinger, from Protect Your Bubble, said: “Many theft victims tell us thieves mounted pavements on push bikes or motorcycles to grab their handsets, so mobile users should always be aware of their surroundings.” poll loading Have you ever had your mobile phone stolen? 0+ VOTES SO FAR YES NO It’s worth installing a phone tracker app too. There are absolutely loads of them available now, which let you track where your phone is using its in-built GPS. This is useful if you think that you have just dropped your phone somewhere or left it in the pub - it’s not a great idea to use it and then confront someone if you think they have pinched your phone. Adding a screen lock is a must - you don’t want crooks to be able to access your phone’s contents with a simple swipe of their finger. At the bare minimum you should go for a four-digit PIN, but going for a password that requires both letters and digits is even safer. Don’t make the mistake of setting one of these ropey passwords. More than half of the phones stolen currently are iPhones And it’s a good idea to make a note of your phone’s IMEI number. If your phone is nicked, you can call the manufacturer with the number, and they can then remotely block access to the handset. The IMEI number is found inside the battery compartment on Android phones and on the back of iPhones. You can also dial *#06# and the IMEI number will appear on your screen. If you are paranoid about losing all of your photos and contact details should you lose your phone, then it’s definitely a good idea to back up all of that info on the cloud. Apple offers its iCloud facility, while Android users can choose from a range of storage apps as well as Google Cloud. Read More Phone Deals Mobile Phone Deals Smartphone Deals iPhone Deals iPhone 6s deals Do I need mobile phone insurance? Some mobile phone insurers have turned down claims as there wasn't sufficient 'force' in the theft Your home insurance should cover your mobile phone if it’s stolen in a burglary. But there are a host of gadget insurers around now, pushing you to take out cover in case your phone or tablet is stolen while you’re out and about. The trouble is, as a product it has a pretty poor reputation - with some people struggling to get payouts on their policy. In 2013 an investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority found many issues, particularly around inadequate claims handling and vague descriptions of what was actually covered. Read More Your family jewels are NOT covered by insurance – how to make sure they're protected Between April 2016 and December 2016 1,352 complaints about mobile phone insurer were taken to the independent Financial Ombudsman Service, with 35% of those complaints upheld. The Ombudsman previously highlighted an incredible case where a person’s claim was rejected as the phone hadn’t been taken by force - the light-fingered thief had stolen her bag without her realising, but that wasn’t good enough the insurer. If you are going to get insurance, it’s clearly crucial that you read the small print so that you understand exactly what is covered. And it pays to do some research on the insurer and what their claims handling is like too.

Club MacStoriesWeekly Extras MENU ABOUT CONTACT NEWSLETTER ADVERTISE SECTIONS APP REVIEWS IPAD DIARIES STORIES APPLE HISTORY IOS AUTOMATION GAMES iPad Diaries: Optimizing Apple Notes TouchRetouch Review: Object Removal Made Easy GAget: Google Analytics Widgets and Alerts for macOS LiquidText 3.0: A Uniquely Digital PDF Experience By Ryan Christoffel LiquidText is one of the few apps that feels uniquely built for the iPad. There is currently no desktop version available, nor iPhone version, and though that may be a negative in some ways, the positive side is that every new feature and enhancement is focused exclusively on iPad use. As a PDF reader, LiquidText has always provided tools that make its reading experience something you couldn't get with a physical document. This is perhaps why it was recognized by Apple as the most innovative iPad app of 2015. But today, with version 3.0, LiquidText not only offers a reading experience that's uniquely digital – it does the same with note-taking and annotation. And the Apple Pencil is a big reason for that. Up until now, developers have added Apple Pencil support to their apps in fairly standard ways – sketching, annotating, note taking. These are all great implementations, and they fit with what the Pencil was designed for: it's primarily a tool for creative professionals. There's nothing wrong with the way the Pencil has been used up until now, but there's nothing uniquely digital about it either; it has been largely restricted to resembling traditional pen and paper use. Drawing or writing with the Pencil is one of the best computing imitations of a traditional pen and paper. But the iPad Pro and Apple Pencil can do more than that, as LiquidText 3.0 shows. Before getting into the particularly fun stuff, I'll mention that LiquidText does cover the basic areas of Apple Pencil support by providing pen and highlighter tools. Annotating PDFs is simple; choose your tool, and get to work. The app provides a variety of colors and size options for your drawing tool, including the nice option to save specific colors as favorites. These are important, welcome additions to the app, but they're not anything new or unique. Most quality PDF apps on iPad have had annotation features like these for a while. What makes LiquidText unique is how it uses the Pencil not just as a tool for annotations, but also as a tool for gestures. One gesture allows you to link objects together simply by drawing a line from one object to another. You can link things like page numbers, highlights, excerpts, comments, and Ink Boxes (more on those later). Drawing a line connects two such objects, and drawing additional lines creates more connections – there's no limit or rules regarding how many connections you make this way. Drawing lines to create links between multiple objects. This line gesture enables a number of possible use cases, including the option to create a mind map with a few simple strokes. Links can be made between objects of a single document, or even when working with two documents side-by-side. And once a link is created, each end of that link will contain a button that quickly takes you to its opposite end. It's a very clever, intuitive system. A second gesture involves drawing shapes around content. Use the Apple Pencil to draw a circle around any area of a document, and on the left edge of the circle a small multidirectional arrow will appear. Tapping and dragging this arrow will allow you to drag away the contents you circled as an excerpt. This newly created excerpt can be dragged to your workspace, or you can make it hover above the rest of the document as a quick reference point. Step one: Circling part of a document presents a multidirectional arrow. The excerpt you drag away is a perfect match for its source; it's as if you physically cut out a portion of a piece of paper and pasted it elsewhere. But when you drag the excerpt away, you don't actually remove the content from its source document; instead, a grey filter overlays the original circled space, but the original content remains readable. Step two: Dragging the circled content into your workspace. When you circle and drag away content like this, a link is created between the content's source and the place you drag it to. So while you can move it anywhere you'd like – into a separate document even – tapping the left-facing arrow button next to the excerpt will take you straight back to the link's opposite end. I've mentioned circling because it's the main way I've used this feature, but the gesture also works with any enclosed shape. This means drawing a box, triangle, or any other full shape will accomplish the same task. Drawing and highlighting within Ink Boxes. In addition to its gesture-based features, LiquidText 3 also adds the option to create Ink Boxes. Essentially, an Ink Box is a comment bubble that's built for ink rather than typing. When you add an Ink Box to a document, a small white box appears, and you can draw or write inside that box without any ink leaving the box's dimensions. You can resize an Ink Box to any size you'd like, change its background color, and move it around anywhere within the document or your workspace. These features add to the previous Apple Pencil support that LiquidText has had since the Pencil's launch, now categorized under a 'Text Select' option in the ink toolbar that lines the bottom of the screen. Text Select makes it easy to select or highlight a portion of text from a document. All of the ink features I've mentioned work best with an Apple Pencil, but LiquidText also includes the option to use your finger or any other type of stylus to perform the same gestures and actions. A button at the far right end of the ink toolbar marked 'FingerDraw' will activate this option. Detailed overviews of all ink features in the help menu. The number of different things that can be done with an Apple Pencil and ink can be difficult to keep track of at first, so LiquidText includes a number of brief tutorial videos in its help section.1 These are all well done, and each is short enough that you can reference it several times if need be. LiquidText is a pro app built exclusively for the iPad. It takes advantage of its platform and the tools that platform provides. It's one thing to create an app that closely resembles the experience of writing with pen and paper; it's another entirely to improve on pen and paper in a uniquely digital way, and that's what this app has done. LiquidText is a free download on the App Store, but a $9.99 Pro upgrade is necessary to gain the new ink features. That upgrade will also unlock the app's MultiDoc features. Users who previously purchased the MultiDoc In-App Purchase can unlock 3.0's new features for a discounted price of $4.99.

X Apple found guilty of fixing iPhone prices by Russian watchdog Company could face fines of as much as 15% of Russian sales but can challenge decision Wed, Mar 15, 2017, 11:18 Apple will have three months to challenge the decision in court. The company has denied the charge.         Apple has been found guilty of price-fixing in Russia, after the country’s anti-monopoly agency said the US company had arranged for retailers to co-ordinate the prices of its iPhone models. Russia’s Federal Antimonopoly Service said yesterday that Apple’s Russian subsidiary had illegally ordered retailers to fix prices of its iPhone 5 and iPhone 6 products, a charge that could see the California-based company fined. Apple had instructed 16 Russian retailers to hold the prices of its iPhone models and contacted them in the event that any products were being sold at “inappropriate” prices, the FAS said in a statement after a seven-month investigation, adding that it suspected Apple was able to terminate sale agreements with retailers if pricing guidelines were not met. Apple could not be reached for comment. When the investigation was announced in August, Apple denied the charge and said that resellers set their own prices for products in Russia and other markets. “In the course of the proceedings the Russian subsidiary of Apple actively co-operated with the FAS,” said the agency’s deputy head, Andrey Tsarikovsky. “The company has adopted the necessary measures to eliminate violations of the law and is pursuing a policy to prevent similar violations in the future.” The ruling comes seven months after Russia’s anti-monopoly agency found Google guilty of violating competition regulations by forcing smartphone manufacturers to give Google products prominence on their devices. The US technology company was fined 438m roubles ($7.4 million). Russia’s FAS, which in 2011 also fined two mobile operators for price-fixing iPhone 4 models, opened its case against Apple after a consumer complaint. Apple will have three months to challenge the decision in court after the full decision is published later this month, Mr Tsarikovsky added. Any fine under the anti-monopoly regulations could be as much as 15 per cent of Apple’s Russian unit’s sales, but would be decided in a few months, Mr Tsarikovsky told Russia’s Interfax news agency. ADVERTISEMENT In June 2015, a New York appeals court ruled that Apple was guilty of conspiring with five publishers to fix the prices of ebooks, resulting in some ebook prices rising to $12.99 or $14.99 from the market leader Amazon’s $9.99 price, according to the US Justice Department. Apple ended up agreeing to pay a $450m settlement to US consumers as compensation in 2016, after the US Supreme Court declined to hear the company’s challenge. The Russian iPhone investigation also involved Apple and a number of its international subsidiaries, but the agency said that it had dropped its investigation against them due to lack of evidence. - Copyright the Financial Times Limited 2017       Topics: Mr Tsarikovsky Justice Department New York Appeals Court The Us Supreme Court Amazon Apple Google Read More Spending on big data and business analytics to hit $150bn this year Dell tops list of Ireland’s best companies to work for Facebook faces fines of up to €50m for hate speech in Germany Analysts trim Snapchat 2017 ad revenue forecast by $30m DCU researchers work on €4.6m cloud project Facebook bars developers from using data for surveillance Irish delegates work to allay Brexit fears at SXSW festival Toshiba considers strategic options for US nuclear unit Yahoo chief in line for $23m golden parachute Mike Hanrahan’s Jet.com works well with Walmart Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Financial Services VHI customers face price hikes from May 1st Technology Review: Samsung’s Galaxy A5 punches above its weight Rugby Joe Schmidt not hiding as Big Brother looms large on horizon Innovation Combilift signs €1m contract during French trade visit Sponsored Who are the ‘Leaders of Tomorrow’?

Today it's a two OS world owned by iOS and Android. In earnest, it's Apple versus Android OEMs. Unfortunately smartphone statistics don't breakout direct comparisons as needed.   With that said, the latest smartphone OS sales data from Kantar shows that iOS achieved continued growth across most regions tracked, except for Japan, Spain, and Urban China.   Android continued to post market share increases in all regions but the US, as no other ecosystem is challenging the two giants – iOS and Android.   Apple's iPhone is still a top seller in large markets such as the U.S. Great Britain, Germany, France and Urban China. Kantar noted that Android lost 1.8% in the U.S. while Apple gained 2.9% year-on-year. In the EU5 market Android accounted for 74.3% of smartphone sales in the three months ending in January 2017. Apple's iOS held a 22.7% share. In Urban China Android gained 9.3% bringing the total to 83.2%.   Beyond stats, Kantar noted a few trends but focused on one: the return of the Nokia brand via HMD in Europe. Kantar expects to see the Nokia brand make a big comeback in Europe and is likely to challenge Huawei over the next few years with an ex-loyal fan base returning to the brand due to quality builds, Android OS and best of class pricing at US$245 (233 Euro) and lower.   Patently Apple posted a report on the return of the Nokia brand in early January covering their true comback at CES 2017. The Nokia brand and pricing could be the one to watch for in the coming years.   Overview of OS Stats Worldwide   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Here's why waiting a few days will be totally worth it. By Luke Johnson / Published 15th March 2017 GETTY/APPLE I-UPDATES: Apple is tipped to launch new iPads and iPhones next week Thinking of buying a new iPad? Stop. Hold up. This week is possibly the worst time to buy a new Apple tablet. Not because of any temporary price hikes or faults, but because new models are on the way. With Apple widely-tipped to launch new iPad and iPhone models in the coming weeks, latest reports have suggested the new devices will drop sooner rather than later. According to reputed tech blog MacRumours, Apple could even debut its eagerly awaited new devices as early as next week. Apple iPhone 8 - Leaked photographs, concept images and renders Friday, 6th January 2017 iPhone 8 is shaping up to be one of the most impressive Apple smartphones to date, with glass panels on the front and rear of the device, a curved borderless OLED display and no Home Button 1 / 10 VENIAMIN GESKIN • TWITTER • CONCEPT IMAGES Apple iPhone 8 will debut a brand-new all-glass look, with a curved OLED display and no physical Home Button Citing "reputable supply chain analysts," the report has claimed insider sources have revealed Apple will launch a selection of new devices in the coming days. According to the analyst, Apple is likely to debut its latest product refresh between Monday, March 20, and Friday, March 24. For those of you who've not checked your calendars recently, that's next week. Originally tipped for a March launch, further reports have, in recent weeks, suggested Apple had pushed the new iPad and iPhone release back until April. Such a move would have helped the Cupertino company avoid sharing a launch window with the Samsung Galaxy S8, arguably the most eagerly awaited device currently waiting in the wings. Samsung has confirmed the Galaxy S8 will be unveiled at a dedicated event on March 29. GETTY/APPLE Although the report failed to detail exactly which new devices would be handed a formal unveiling, past leaks have suggested new iPads and iPhones are on the cards. With the iPad Pro 2 expected to up Apple's tablet game, on the smartphone front, an all new iPhone SE and new iPhone 7 colours have been tipped to make an appearance. The eagerly awaited iPhone 8 is not expected to launch until September. According to past reports, Apple could give its tablet line up a comprehensive update, with a new 10.5-inch model tipped to land alongside refreshed 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch devices. It's believed the new 10.5-inch device will be a super high-end offering, with the sizeable screen squeezed in to a body no bigger than the existing 9.7-inch iPad Pro. This will be made possible by narrowing down the device's screen framing bezels. Although Apple has yet to comment on the claims, evidence has been mounting that new iPad models are on the way. In recent weeks, iPad Pro stocks have started to dwindle. With many models moving to shipping windows of '2-3 weeks', it's been suggested the limited availability points to new models being prepped for launch. The revamped iPhone SE is set to bring only minor updates while white and red iPhone 7 colours have been tipped to join the also extensive black, jet black, silver, gold and rose gold handset options.

Or Samsung’s Galaxy S8. Or, as rumor has it, the special anniversary edition iPhone that we’re all expecting to blow us away. Designing his idea of what that Apple phone will look like is digital artist Gabor Balogh (who previously showed us an attractive vision for what smartwatches should look like): Gabor’s concept ties the borderless screen in with a new augmented reality (AR) system that would essentially turn the iPhone into a window unto the world around us, with handy information superimposed on top. That’s been the AR premise since as far back as apps like Layar in 2009, but it’s never properly panned out. Having said that, Apple CEO Tim Cook has gone on the record with his belief that AR will be bigger and more compelling than VR, which, taken together with Apple’s acquisitions in this field, suggests Apple is taking the technology seriously. I’m a real fan of the synergy that’s on display in these concept images. Augmented reality has always been quite a clunky thing, with app designers struggling to figure out how to both display the useful information and keep the visuals uncluttered (i.e. the augmentations would often get in the way of the reality), but when you have a boundless screen, there’s plenty of room to set interface components out of the way. This being a concept, it does take some liberties with the physical constraints of our somber real world. The display, for starters, has no bottom bezel whatsoever, which looks futuristic, but would be a nightmare to handle and is probably impractical in engineering terms anyway. Then there’s the issue of battery life, which would quickly drain away if you spend all your time with the camera on and filling a significantly larger display than previous iPhone generations. And the idea of obtaining people’s heart rate, body temperature, and breaths per minute with a quick scan of your camera is simply fanciful. Cool, of course, but fanciful. If anything, looking at this implementation and thinking about the things standing in its way makes me think that Apple’s first foray into AR would probably come on the iPad rather than the iPhone. Working with a bigger battery and screen would ease many of the constraints that currently get in the way of a phone doing good AR (and I just don’t see Gabor’s concept as particularly realistic, even if he does endear himself to me by featuring one of my photo essays in the image below). But still, the awesome thing about exploring concept images and ideas of this kind is that they provide ample food for thoughts about the future of smartphones as a whole.

ADVERTISEMENT In a ruling published on Tuesday, the Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) said Apple was guilty of fixing prices of the iPhone 5s models, 5c, iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, and iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, when they went on sale. The FAS says Apple Russia told 16 major resellers in the country to stick to certain prices for the phone models and "supported them for about three months".

The FAS said it believes that if those selling the phones did not comply with the requests, it would be possible for Apple to withdraw their ability to sell the iPhones. "The Company has adopted the necessary measures to eliminate violations of the law and pursuing a policy to prevent similar violations in the future: the company developed a detailed antitrust compliance, organised training of employees of the Russian antimonopoly legislation norms," Andrey Tsarikovsky, the deputy head of the FAS, is quoted as saying in a translated statement.

Any fine could be as much as 15 per cent of Apple Russia's unit sales – the fine will be set in coming months, Tsarikovsky, said. The investigation was opened in Russia in August 2016. At the time, Apple denied it had told resellers to sell devices at certain prices. A spokesperson said: "Resellers set their own prices for the Apple products they sell in Russia and around the world". Following the conclusion of the investigation, which the FAS says Apple co-operated with, the Silicon Valley firm says it is "glad to put this matter behind us". A spokesperson told the Financial Times that it is "deeply committed to making sure our resellers are able to compete fairly in the markets where we do business". The firm has three months to appeal the decision.

In March 2016 the firm was told to pay $450 million (£367m) as part of a settlement after the US Supreme Court said it had worked with five publishers to set the price of ebooks. The Supreme Court's decision came at the end of a lengthy court battle that started in 2013. Ultimately, it was decided that the price fixing scheme saw some ebook prices to rise to $12.99 or $14.99 from the $9.99 that was being charged by Amazon. Subscribe to WIRED ADVERTISEMENT The Department of Justice said Apple had worked with Lagardere SCA’s Hachette Book Group Inc, News Corp’s HarperCollins Publishers LLC, Penguin Group Inc, CBS Corp’s Simon & Schuster Inc and Verlagsgruppe Georg von Holtzbrinck GmbH’s Macmillan, to set the prices. Apple had been accused of working with the publishers in 2010 as it was launching the first version of the iPad. It's also not the first time Russian officials have taken-on the business practices of major tech companies within the country. In August 2016 the FAS fined Google 438 million rubles (£6m) after it said Google violated laws by forcing mobile-device makers to install Google Play on its Android operating system. Elsewhere, European Union officials have investigated similar issues: Google's Android division has been charged with breaking EU competition law and Apple has been ordered to repay £11 billion in unpaid taxes.

International Business Times UK UK World Business Politics Fintech Technology Science Sport Entertainment Opinion Video Pictures Log out Newsletter Signup Technology Companies Apple found guilty of illegally fixing prices of iPhone 5 and 6 in Russia iPhone-maker has three months time to appeal against the decision. By Agamoni Ghosh March 15, 2017 10:12 GMT The ruling only apples to Apple's Russian subsidiaryReuters Russia's Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) has held Apple guilty of illegally fixing retail prices of iPhone 5 and 6 models in the country. The probe concluded that Apple's Russian subsidiary, Apple Rus was accused of infringing laws by ordering 16 retailers to hold the price of these iPhone models and contact them if the devices were sold at "inappropriate" prices. Apple would eventually terminate the sale agreement with these retailers if the pricing guidelines were not met. The ruling however, only applies to Apple's Russian subsidiary, as the FAS dropped a similar investigation against Apple Inc and other international subsidiaries "due to lack of evidence". The iPhone-maker is expected to face a fine of up to 15% of its Russian sales revenue, but the company has three months time to appeal against the decision, after it will released later this month. A spokesperson from the company commenting on the matter told Financial Times, "We worked closely with FAS during their investigation and are glad to put this matter behind us. We work hard to make the best products and services in the world for our customers and are deeply committed to making sure our resellers are able to compete fairly in the markets where we do business." The investigation concluded that the pricing was being fixed for the last few years – since the launch of the iPhone 5, iPhone 6, 6S and its Plus models. Last year's iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are said to be out of this price fixing ring as the regulator did not find any signs of price fixing. The 16 major resellers mentioned in the probe are MTS, M Video, Beeline, Eldorado, Euroset , OZON, re: Store, Messenger, Megafon, Yulmart, Media Markt, Citylink, Holodilnik.ru, DNS, ION and Technosila Last year Russian authorities found American tech giant Google guilty of forcing smartphone-makers to feature its own services more prominently on Android phones. Further, regulators forced both Apple and Google to remove LinkedIn from their Russian app stores earlier this year. More from IBTimes UK When is Apple WWDC 2017 and what can we expect from iOS 11?

Similar to CBS network's "60 Minutes" in the United States, the China Central Television (CCTV) show known as "315" in reference to global consumer rights day on March 15, has previously named and shamed firms from Apple Inc to Volkswagen AG. The two-hour gala - a mix of undercover reports and song-and-dance - can hit a firm's reputation if singled out for bad corporate behaviour. Apple was forced into a rare apology in 2013 after criticism on the show of its after-sales service. "The days that a big company would be completely caught with its pants down are largely past," said James Feldkamp, Shanghai-based CEO of independent China consumer watchdog Mingjian. "Pretty much all the big corporations have their PR machines ready to jump into action because they've seen what happens when companies are not prepared." The day itself often sees a flurry of goodwill gestures by firms - from free apple pies to give-away iPads - to help soften any blow from being named and shamed. It has also ballooned beyond the CCTV show with smaller events around the country. South Korean businesses, especially, may fear being singled out this year amid pressure from Beijing on companies in apparent retaliation for the deployment in South Korea of the THAAD anti-missile system. China sees the system's powerful radar as a threat to its security. "The period around 315 is certainly when everyone's bow strings get a bit more tense," said Wei Wei, Shanghai-based marketing manager at communications firm MSLGroup China. She said the firm would monitor the show for clients, create reports to lay out the impact if a sector was targeted, or prepare an emergency response if a client was snagged. "If our client is really named on 315 then we have to take immediate action, you can't wait," she said. "The golden period for crisis response is the first three days, and you have to come up with a very clear response." The programme has lost some of its bite in recent years, with some viewers jumping to defend targeted companies and younger audiences simply switching channels. Chatter online about the event has dipped sharply since 2014, according to a Reuters analysis of posts on China's Sina Weibo. Last year's show criticised local food delivery apps, fake online sales and dodgy false teeth, but didn't take aim at any major international firms. Chinese shoppers Reuters spoke to said they weren't likely to stay up to watch the show, but would check the next day who was targeted. Some sectors were more sensitive than others. "What I pay attention to is food safety. After all, what you eat has a direct affect on your health," said Maple Zhu, a 27-year-old media professional in Shanghai. "But the impact on consumers is usually short-lived, after a little while most people just forget."

Similar to CBS network's "60 Minutes" in the United States, the China Central Television (CCTV) show known as "315" in reference to global consumer rights day on March 15, has previously named and shamed firms from Apple Inc to Volkswagen AG. The two-hour gala - a mix of undercover reports and song-and-dance - can hit a firm's reputation if singled out for bad corporate behaviour. Apple was forced into a rare apology in 2013 after criticism on the show of its after-sales service. "The days that a big company would be completely caught with its pants down are largely past," said James Feldkamp, Shanghai-based CEO of independent China consumer watchdog Mingjian. "Pretty much all the big corporations have their PR machines ready to jump into action because they've seen what happens when companies are not prepared." The day itself often sees a flurry of goodwill gestures by firms - from free apple pies to give-away iPads - to help soften any blow from being named and shamed. It has also ballooned beyond the CCTV show with smaller events around the country. South Korean businesses, especially, may fear being singled out this year amid pressure from Beijing on companies in apparent retaliation for the deployment in South Korea of the THAAD anti-missile system. China sees the system's powerful radar as a threat to its security. "The period around 315 is certainly when everyone's bow strings get a bit more tense," said Wei Wei, Shanghai-based marketing manager at communications firm MSLGroup China. She said the firm would monitor the show for clients, create reports to lay out the impact if a sector was targeted, or prepare an emergency response if a client was snagged. "If our client is really named on 315 then we have to take immediate action, you can't wait," she said. "The golden period for crisis response is the first three days, and you have to come up with a very clear response." The programme has lost some of its bite in recent years, with some viewers jumping to defend targeted companies and younger audiences simply switching channels. Chatter online about the event has dipped sharply since 2014, according to a Reuters analysis of posts on China's Sina Weibo. Last year's show criticised local food delivery apps, fake online sales and dodgy false teeth, but didn't take aim at any major international firms. Chinese shoppers Reuters spoke to said they weren't likely to stay up to watch the show, but would check the next day who was targeted. Some sectors were more sensitive than others. "What I pay attention to is food safety. After all, what you eat has a direct affect on your health," said Maple Zhu, a 27-year-old media professional in Shanghai. "But the impact on consumers is usually short-lived, after a little while most people just forget."

The relaxation of trade rules and lack of laws policing technology-based enterprises across the globe have allowed huge firms from America, like Google, Apple and Uber to prosper worldwide; and do so amid questionable and unethical business practice sometimes. Revelations of lowly remunerated workers slaving away to make luxurious Apple products in Chinese and Taiwanese sweatshops have done nothing to curb the popularity and sales of the aforementioned high-end goods in South Africa. The ubiquitous one-way flow of technology-based goods and services from America and Europe to developing nations like South Africa has unfortunately become the hallmark of world trade. Yet President Donald Trump won a four-year mandate partly on the back of promises he made to renegotiate the terms of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), a trade pact he described as “the worst trade deal ever” before the November presidential poll last year. Highly unpopular shutdowns of businesses in America and company relocations to Mexico have led to a remarkable rise in xenophobia in certain sections of American society and calls for greater protectionist policies from right leaning organisations. South African companies have not been exempted from losing business to foreign-based corporations. Blue-collar workers are losing jobs to European Union (EU) and US-based companies in an ever-changing industrial landscape. Metered taxi operators on Friday held a public protest against Uber in and around the vicinity of OR Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg, in what can only be described as a priceless and ingenious move to bring increased attention to their four-year Uber dilemma and get help and support. You cannot picture the late Oliver Tambo with all of his revolutionary enthusiasm abandoning the long-established trustworthiness of a metered cab for the consumerist cosiness of a low-cost Uber ride. The protracted struggle for economic opportunities unfolding between the haves and have-nots is somewhat of a timely reminder that small businesses in South Africa are not operating on fairground most of the time. Uber is funded by big businesses like Google and Toyota and has received billions of dollars in backing from the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia. So Uber is certainly not the sort of corporate giant a one-man outfit from Katlehong in Johannesburg can compete with for long without going bust in a big way.  If things remain as they are, the financial muscle of Uber may possibly overwhelm metered taxi drivers, who have family and children to fend for, very soon. But small businesses are big business if data from the leading economy in the world is analysed. According to Entrepreneur Magazine, there are roughly 25 – 27 million small businesses in America, which account for 60 – 80% of all jobs in that economy. Small businesses in South Africa can do much to provide economic opportunities for lowly skilled workers and unemployed graduates if they get technical, financial and regulatory support from the requisite institutions. While the prospect of operating an Uber taxi sounds lucrative and easy to run, Uber taxis are incredibly cheap for customers, so they do not offer excellent returns for partner-drivers. Travas Kalanick, CEO of Uber, had to issue a public apology after he was captured on video swearing at Fawzi Kamel, a company driver, in New York in December. Kamel had complained about the fare structure Uber employs and lamented how it was bleeding his small business dry. The hands-off arrangement Uber utilises works well for its operations, but seemingly impoverishes drivers who bear all of the maintenance costs for their vehicles. Additionally, save for a driver rating system, Uber offers no safety nets for its valued commuters. It claims to be a tech company that only brings customers and drivers together. So in the unfortunate event of an accident: Uber holds no liability whatsoever for injuries sustained by the very people who use the ride-sharing app and board private cars under the impression Uber is in control of everything. In addition – Uber drivers, who are not technically employed by the Internet-based transport company, do not receive medical aid assistance or enjoy security of employment. Uber also has a befuddling and controversial tax structure that has been widely condemned by EU leaders for the company pays very little in corporate tax wherever it operates. So should there have been rules in place before Uber was allowed to open its doors to travellers in South Africa? Absolutely. The regulations governing the metered taxi industry took a fair amount of time to catch up with the online-based Uber. Should Uber be obliged to work in partnership with local metered taxi operators? Definitely. Is it outlandish to suggest that metered taxi drivers deserve the same protection bigger firms are getting from the predacious habits of foreign businesses? Hardly. Some manner of protectionism is required no doubt for the drivers whose businesses face total collapse in the next year or so. The metered taxi drivers are not fully equipped to compete against Uber and may suffer long periods of redundancy and bankruptcy if measures are not enacted to protect their businesses this year. Like the food manufacturers who are complaining about the European Union dumping cheap chicken on the local market – metered taxi drivers are bemoaning the cheap transport Uber has unleashed on South African roads. It is a no brainer: the metered taxi industry needs our help. -MyNews24 Get Published!

The press release he wrote for our first app was picked up on by several reviewers, bringing publicity to our app. So we prepaid for him to write our future press releases. Our apps are micro apps and very specialized, so we were not sure what to expect and recognized there might not be much interest. We were pleasantly surprised with the result from the press release.

The move by Taylor, who is one of the most outspoken critics of Spotify, delivered an early blow to Apple's bid to dominate the booming sector two years ago.

Mark Wahlberg signs deal worth 'more than $10 million' with... Share this article Share She said that the tech giant, which launched Apple Music in June 2015, will not pay for songs streamed during a free three-month trial period for new subscribers. 'I find it to be shocking, disappointing and completely unlike this historically progressive and generous company,' she wrote in a posting on Tumblr. Out and a pout: The Shake It Off hitmaker, who hit out at streaming services for offering her music for free in 2015, is said to have made moves to brand a website 'featuring non-downloadable multi-media content in the nature of audio recordings' Taylor - whose '1989' was the top-selling US album in 2014 and remained high on the charts - insisted that she was speaking for all artists and not just herself. 'This is about the new artist or band that has just released their first single and will not be paid for its success. This is about the young songwriter who just got his or her first cut and thought that the royalties from that would get them out of debt. 'This is about the producer who works tirelessly to innovate and create, just like the innovators and creators at Apple are pioneering in their field…but will not get paid for a quarter of a year’s worth of plays on his or her songs. 'These are not the complaints of a spoiled, petulant child. These are the echoed sentiments of every artist, writer and producer in my social circles who are afraid to speak up publicly because we admire and respect Apple so much.' Hitting back: TMZ report that the website will be dubbed 'Swifties' and will launch a line of music products complete with guitars, picks, straps and drumsticks atop organising educational trips, online courses and retreats 'Three months is a long time to go unpaid, and it is unfair to ask anyone to work for nothing. I say this with love, reverence, and admiration for everything else Apple has done,' she continued. 'I hope that soon I can join them in the progression towards a streaming model that seems fair to those who create this music. I think this could be the platform that gets it right. 'But I say to Apple with all due respect, it’s not too late to change this policy and change the minds of those in the music industry who will be deeply and gravely affected by this. We don’t ask you for free iPhones. Please don’t ask us to provide you with our music for no compensation.'  MailOnline has contacted a representative for Taylor for comment.   Hitting back: Taylor - whose '1989' was the top-selling US album last year and remained high on the charts - insisted that she was speaking for all artists and not just herself Share or comment on this article e-mail 169 shares Most watched News videos Homeless man brought to tears following incredible transformation Dancing Prince seen talking to mystery woman at Verbier party Little girl is overcome with emotion as her dad meets her from school Train ploughs snow as it pulls into New York station Good samaritan saves police deputy by shooting his attacker Will's got the love!

KRON4 tech reporter Gabe Slate's peek inside one of the smart houses demonstrates the extent of the HomeKit integration, which costs $2500 per house and includes a number of HomeKit-enabled smart devices. Using just their iPad or iPhone, the homeowner is able to control the Kwikset lock on the front door, adjust room temperature via the Ecobee thermostat, adjust the Philips Hue lighting around the house, and lower and raise Lutron shades in the various rooms. Meanwhile in the living room, the homeowner is able to control the fans in the rooms upstairs using the Siri Remote on an Apple TV, and activate a movie watching mode that dims the lights and brings down the blinds. KB Home has offered home automation as an option in its houses for about 10 years, but before Apple's entry into the smart home space with HomeKit, homeowners typically had to use a different app for each smart product in the houses. "In some respects, what KB Home is doing makes sense," said IDC researcher Jonathan Gaw, speaking to The Mercury News. "It's much easier to have some smart home products like light switches installed by a home builder when a house is constructed. Also, rolling the costs for those products into the home mortgage allows home buyers to more easily afford them upfront — and helps builders sell a higher priced home." The convenience of smart home integration could be a big draw for a new generation of tech-savvy homeowners. Some of KB Home's houses have USB chargers built into the power outlets, for example. However, Gaw warns of the risk of obsolescence hitting a still nascent industry. "It"s not clear yet exactly what products consumers will really want or use or even what smart home product companies will be around in five or ten years," he said. "Customers may find in six months or a couple years that they don't use the products they have or that they're defunct or no longer supported." Last week, German pre-fabricated home company WeberHaus announced plans to support HomeKit in its SmartHomes starting in 2017, making it the first homebuilder in Europe to officially support Apple's home automation system.

For 2,500 dollars I'd be more willing to get up off my butt and change the thermostat, or turn on the lights. Rating: 2 Votes Jax44 1 day ago at 07:16 am Not much comprehension here. The $2500 includes: The entry door lock. The Hue lights around the house. The Lutron shades. The Ecobee thermostat. Upstairs fans integration. Movie scene integration. All installed and working with HomeKit. Rating: 2 Votes imola.zhp 1 day ago at 01:50 pm Can you list some of these potential significant updates that would require someone to replace the device? Older HomeKit light switches and thermostats will continue work regardless of how great new replacement model is. And if the updates are significant enough, it's not like you have to replace every single devices at once. And with HomeKit, a device will continue to work even if the company goes out of business. And I frankly don't think these HomeKit devices are all that expensive. If you are trying to update every single things in the house with HomeKit, the cost could add up. But you can replace them in piece meal as it makes sense to you. Some people believe that once a new version of something comes out, the old one must be tossed in the trash and the new one must be installed, immediately. I don't agree with this logic. A lot of my devices are previous generation and are working great, when they do get upgraded, replaced, changed, the outgoing device is put back in its original packaging and sold on eBay to the next owner/user. Rating: 1 Votes thisisnotmyname 2 days ago at 06:24 am $2500 per house? You can achieve this for about $40 with a raspberry pi with Home Assistant and Homebridge installed and some Etekcity rf sockets. In the bay areas that's likely only 0.1% (0.25% on lower end new builds) on the price of the home, it doesn't matter. Further, your $40 worth of pi and sockets doesn't control locks, thermostat, and shades. Hue also has color settings that your receptacles won't replicate. Rating: 1 Votes avanpelt 1 day ago at 07:52 am My concern with KB is basically the same reason I' never setup HomeKit for anyone but myself. I'd immediately become the tech-support person for them. Imagine how terrible that one person's life is who has to be the "home kit tech support" for KB Homes customers. Case in point, last night I kept asking Siri to turnt he TV lights down to 50% (Hue Blume lights behind TV mount). Turns out I called that room "television" not "TV" so you have to issue the specific exact command or Siri will not be able to help. Damn, very nice setup. I concur with your thoughts, though. HomeKit integration is not ready for most "normal" people yet if Siri can't understand that "television" and "TV" are the same thing. Right now, I think Siri's idiocy is one of the fatal flaws with HomeKit. Apple touts Siri integration as one of the main selling points of HomeKit; but when you're talking to something that sometimes lacks basic logic, it's incredibly frustrating. Here's hoping that Siri gets some long overdue updates this year. Rating: 1 Votes nutmac 1 day ago at 12:26 pm Building this in to a home is insane, with rapidly changing technology. Who is going to spend £2500 every time there is a significant update? With a raspberry pi based kit you can at least update it without bankrupting yourself. It even works with Alexa, as well as HomeKit/Siri. Can you list some of these potential significant updates that would require someone to replace the device? Older HomeKit light switches and thermostats will continue work regardless of how great new replacement model is. And if the updates are significant enough, it's not like you have to replace every single devices at once. And with HomeKit, a device will continue to work even if the company goes out of business. And I frankly don't think these HomeKit devices are all that expensive. If you are trying to update every single things in the house with HomeKit, the cost could add up. But you can replace them in piece meal as it makes sense to you. Rating: 1 Votes adamjackson 1 day ago at 06:52 am $2500 is about what I spent to home-kit my home-remodel we just did. We spent a bit more than that 21 Hue Lights Ecobee 3 2 Schlage Connect Deadbolts 2 Hunter Fans Two Lutron switches Two bluetooth controlled outdoor security lights 3 Nest Protects We spent another 3K on a home server / media center setup. unifi Switch, router, 4 access points, Synology server with 32 terabytes of storage, Cat 6 Wiring in every room, whole home audio w/ Sonos, an Alexa or Dot in every room. Wall mounted iPad mini 4 w/ a wall mount in every room so you can carry it around with you to make a Home command and then dock it on the wall or kitchen (nice for reviewing recipes) ----- After about 2 weeks of living with the system, it's really nice BUT I'll say most times, flicking the switch is way easier than asking Siri to do it. I'm still getting used to the setup. ---- My concern with KB is basically the same reason I' never setup HomeKit for anyone but myself. I'd immediately become the tech-support person for them. Imagine how terrible that one person's life is who has to be the "home kit tech support" for KB Homes customers. Case in point, last night I kept asking Siri to turnt he TV lights down to 50% (Hue Blume lights behind TV mount). Turns out I called that room "television" not "TV" so you have to issue the specific exact command or Siri will not be able to help.

British backpacker murdered in India was raped before she died, police confirm But could Samsung be about to shake things up – with a radical folding design which unfolds into a tablet? Multiple rumours suggest that the device – which folds in two, like a notebook – could be unveiled at the IFA technology show in Berlin in autumn this year, just before Apple unveils iPhone 8. The phone has already been shown off to people behind closed doors at Mobile World Congress, according to Boy Genius Report. No credit Both Samsung and LG are planning to launch devices which ‘unfold’ into larger screens – allowing users to keep a tablet-style device in a pocket, according to the Korea Herald. Apple also quietly patented a foldable iPhone concept, filing on August 28, last year – detailing a device which uses ‘carbon nanotubes’ to allow the screen to fold while still working. Lee Seung Woo, an analyst at IBK Securities Company said last year, ‘‘This product could be a game-changer if Samsung successfully comes up with a user interface suitable for bendable screens,’ ‘Their biggest obstacle was related to making transparent plastics and making them durable, which seems resolved by now.’ Samsung has previously teased the idea with various videos showing how a ‘bendable’ smartphone might work. Nearly two years ago, Samsung wowed an audience in Las Vegas with a working mobile phone screen which could be rolled and unrolled like a sheet of paper. The screen kept working as it was rolled and unrolled – and was built to be “virtually unbreakable”, Samsung claimed.

New iPhone 8 Concept Imagines Siri with Augmented Reality Features GO Apple will unveil the next iPhone later this year Mar 15, 2017 09:07 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Apple is working hard on the upcoming iPhone 8 or iPhone X, the device that will mark the ten-year anniversary since the first iPhone was announced. According to reports, Apple has decided to bring several major changes to the new phone. iPhone 8 will be the first iPhone to feature an OLED display, as well as wireless charging and no physical home button, a move which its main competitor Samsung has also employed. iPhone 8 was imagined in a number of concepts, the latest one having been created by designer Gabor Balogh. iPhone X concept What’s different about this concept is the inclusion of augmented reality features to Apple’s AI virtual assistant, Siri. The new features would allow Siri and widgets to connect with the outside world. Augmented reality features baked into Siri The designer believes that Apple won’t adopt the Touch bar of the MacBook Pro on its new iPhone, as it would clash with the virtual home button. In addition, the home button would retain its position at the bottom of the screen, in a function area. iPhone 8 would have augmented reality features baked into Siri, which would allow the virtual assistant to recognize the user’s environment and objects when holding the phone up and pointing the main camera. Renders show Siri recognizing and offering info about landmarks or directions to a specific destination, based on the user’s current location. Concept of Siri offering directions using AR Contextual widgets are imagined as tools that would appear next to the home/Siri button and offer options like the camera or shortcuts to various apps, including Facebook. The designer also imagined a feature that would allow users to point the phone at family members or friends and get information about their health, like heart rate, number of breaths per minute, and body temperature. Concept of Siri integrated with AR features The designer’s concept is based on recent iPhone 8 rumors and Apple acquisitions, but there’s no guarantee that the phone will look exactly like this or that AR technology would be integrated in such a way, although we sure hope so.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (7 Images) #Apple#iPhone 8#iPhone X#Augmented reality#OLED display subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it iPhone X concept (7 Images) 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Eye iPhone Case Runs Stock Android and Brings Back Headphone Jack New iPhone Edition Concept Video Reveals Dark Mode on OLED Display Anniversary iPhone Said to Feature Flat Display, Despite “Curved” Screen Rumors Apple iPhone Edition Concept Reveals Edge-to-Edge Display Samsung Galaxy S8 Features Camera and Iris Scanner Improvements LibreOffice 5.3 Office Suite Gets First Point Release with 100 Improvements Study: 96% of Websites Get Attacked by Bad Bots Windows 10 Creators Update Hides a Secret Ad Switch, Privacy Group Warns YouTube Discontinues Annoying Annotations LXLE 16.04.2 GNU/Linux Distro to Bring All the Goodies from Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS Netflix Turns to Thumbs Up/Down Ratings, Ditches 5-Stars System Intel Launches Bug Bounty Program, Offers Rewards of Up to $30,000 7 photos    iPhone X concept with Siri features new ios apps NeuroNation: Train your brain to improve your memory and focus with NeuroNation Flipagram: Create cool videos by mixing up your photos with music Timer+: Set up dozens of timers and control them all with ease Nutshell Camera: Create some pretty cool videos with Nutshell Camera IKEA Catalogue: Check out the IKEA Catalogue for more than just furniture Complete: Complete puts a social twist to your regular to-do list/ task manager WebMD Baby: WebMD Baby offers help in how to best tend to your baby Reader comments Apple Faces Fine in Russia After Being Charged with Fixing iPhone Prices more on: Apple i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

Share Tweet Share Tags : Samsung-Samsung+ iOS-iOS+ Apple-Apple+ Android-Android+ Galaxy S8 could sport a pressure-sensitive virtual home button areaEver since Apple announced its 3D Touch technology for pressure-sensitive screens on the iPhone 6s, it has been incorporating and enhancing it further throughout its whole lineup, but what about its rumored iPhone 8 that will eventually be the first Cupertino design to utilize an OLED display? Well, Samsung, Apple's eventual supplier of OLED panels, may have found a solution. Korean media is exclusively reporting today that Samsung has developed advanced pressure-sensitive technology for its OLED displays, and it has been showcased to a limited number of partners during the MWC expo two weeks ago. The source claims that we will see a limited application of this technology as soon as the Galaxy S8 that is expected to be announced as Samsung's Unpacked event on March 29th.  We say limited, as pressure sensitivity would apparently only be active in the navigation strip on the bottom of the screen, and the new virtual home button in particular, allowing you to open up various menus by harder or gentler presses. According to the industry insiders who commented on the matter, a full implementation of a pressure-sensitive display by Samsung would eventually come later this year, with the Note 8.  Samsung has already patented force touch panelsThe Huawei P9 Plus has an OLED panel with what Huawei calls Force Touch, but it is essentially the same pressure-sensitive tech Apple utilizes, too, as you can see in the video below. Thus, there are precedents of OLED phones with pressure-sensitive displays, and Samsung even patented the technology recently, so we can't wait to see how it's been implemented in the S8, Note 8, and, eventually, in the OLED iPhone 8.  Given that Android Nougat already brings app shortcuts when you hold a home screen icon, it has to be some more creative implementation than simply pop-up menus, in order to warrant an extra layer of screen technology getting built around it. source: The Investor You can now (sort of) use Android Wear 2.0's complications on a Wear 1.0 15 Mar Prev news The Huawei P10 Lite makes another appearance in Europe; new listing shows 15 Mar Next news Close newer posts Google and Indian carrier Jio said to be working on an affordable 4G phone 15 Mar HTC is teasing "an unexpected surprise" to be revealed on March 20 15 Mar Gionee A1 hands-on: An exotic monster from Asia with an excellent selfie 15 Mar The Huawei P10 Lite makes another appearance in Europe; new listing shows 15 Mar Now reading: Galaxy S8 may have a pressure-sensitive home key, Note 8 a whole display Galaxy S8 may have a pressure-sensitive home key, Note 8 a whole display 15 Mar You can now (sort of) use Android Wear 2.0's complications on a Wear 1.0 15 Mar Russian anti-monopoly agency finds Apple guilty of price-fixing with the 15 Mar HTC's Sense Companion virtual assistant app now available for free from 15 Mar Meizu Pro 7 rumored to feature Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor, dual 15 Mar Samsung's next Tizen flavored handset receives FCC certification 15 Mar older posts Related phones PhoneArena rating: Not rated User rating: Not rated Apple iPhone 8 Specifications News[28] Rivals Size it Videos PhoneArena rating: Not rated User rating: Not rated Samsung Galaxy S8 Specifications News[135] Rivals Size it Videos Related News   Report: Samsung to use a mix of fingerprint, iris, and facial scans for mobile payments with the Galaxy S8   IHS: Galaxy S8 with 6GB RAM is in the wings, but only for China   Samsung Galaxy S8 pre-orders reportedly starting on April 7   Samsung Galaxy S8 Canadian release date allegedly confirmed   The OLED iPhone 8 curves may be smaller than Samsung’s, 5.2" viewable area tipped   Genius: best foldable USB chargers with built-in power banks for your iPhone or Android 46 Comments Follow Following Options Close Always view all comments Show comments: default show moderated comments Display mode: Threaded Chronological Newest first Save 1 2 Next » posted on yesterday, 03:41 2 Reply 1.

At this rate the last best Samsung device will be the S7 edge. posted on yesterday, 03:51 13 Reply 4. trojan_horse (Posts: 3077; Member since: 06 May 2016) "No its useless" That's you insight about it, so it doesn't necessarily make it useless indeed. To each his own. "At this rate the last best Samsung device will be the S7 edge." Again your opinion, which is fine. But I vehemently disagree with that, as the S8 will definitely be better than the S7 edge, as per the leaks which have been flooding lately. posted on yesterday, 04:08 0 Reply 8. ShadowSnypa786 (Posts: 81; Member since: 06 Jan 2017) Performance wise you wont be able to tell the difference in power unless you do a benchamark test. The only thing new and different is the bezeless display which makes the device more fragile plus the worst place for a fingerprint sensor and no more home button. Looks like im sticking with S7 edge till they go back to the older ways. posted on yesterday, 07:09 0 in response to #8 in response to #8 Hide Reply 27. mikehunta727 (Posts: 631; Member since: 12 Sep 2014) Um... You'll defitnetly be able to tell a performance improvement in the S8 with new UFS 2.1 and 835 vs 820 and UFS 2.0..... It will actually be quite noticeable, all while also being more power efficient posted on yesterday, 09:03 0 in response to #27 in response to #27 Hide Reply 32. ShadowSnypa786 (Posts: 81; Member since: 06 Jan 2017) UFS 2.1 will definetly read and write data faster since Samsung introduced 2.0 with the S6 edge they know what they doing. But cpu performance wise the 835 isn't a huge upgrade from last years cpu. Hopefully it will be more effiicent but in the recent benchmarks it wasn't that great. posted on yesterday, 10:33 0 in response to #32 in response to #32 Hide Reply 34. mikehunta727 (Posts: 631; Member since: 12 Sep 2014) If the 835 CPU and GPU can sustain it's performance for considerably longer then the 820/821 in long term performance runs then it will already be quite a bit better then the 820/821. 835 raw CPU perf may not be much higher but I am sure it will thermal throttle much less on both CPU/GPU side posted on yesterday, 13:17 0 in response to #32 in response to #32 Hide Reply 35. AStar (Posts: 6; Member since: 25 Feb 2017) Major improvement will be in UFS 2.1 with dual lane, which will what we would most likely see on the S8. Apps will be loading lot faster, even faster than OnePlus. posted on yesterday, 15:47 0 in response to #8 in response to #8 Hide Reply 38. TechieXP1969 (Posts: 12060; Member since: 25 Sep 2013) Well I guess you wont be back...so BYE!!! The home button isnt coming back, so there wont even be a FPS on the front in thsi style again...EVER. The move is goign to phones basically being a full display on the from with any input being touch, voice or pen. Unlocking is going to face-recognition and you can use other methods liek password, pass-code or 9-dot. posted on 19 hours ago 0 Reply 45. SuperAndroid17 (Posts: 8; Member since: 03 Feb 2013) I agree with you a 100%, having the fingerprint scanner on the front is the best placement. I will be definitely holding on to my s7 edge, the only thing i wish the s7 edge had was a bigger screen. 5.7 ,stereo speakers and the s7 edge would have been perfect. posted on yesterday, 03:50 0 Reply 2.

TechieXP1969 (Posts: 12060; Member since: 25 Sep 2013) Don't wanna rub it in, but I'm not missin' my Note 7. Still using mine and loving it. TBH, I couldnt even imagine being with it, between wating for the next model. After using the S7 edge for one day, after returning one of my T-Mobile Note 7's, I honestly felt I was gonna die. Reaching for my pen is still a habit because I use the pen now more than I even did on my Note 3,4 and 5 combined (mostly because i have more drawing apps) When I hold it...its like the best thing ever! Next XMAS I will likely gift it or sell it, it depends on what the Note 8 is like. Because i like the Note 7 so much, I may not even want the 8. I don't like the S. I use too. But after gettign the Note, I don't like the S. The S8 looks nice, but I'm not feeling the design right now. Am sure the Note 8 will use a similar design but more squared vs rounded like the S. But I don't like on-screen buttons and that for me could be a deal breaker and I will or could just keep my Note 7. posted on yesterday, 03:50 0 Reply 3. haruken (Posts: 30; Member since: 06 Nov 2013) Focus on the embedded fingerprint screen instead of this gimmick. posted on yesterday, 04:34 1 Reply 12.

TechieXP1969 (Posts: 12060; Member since: 25 Sep 2013) We all know Synaptics is actually the company that pioneered "Force Touch" and Apple simply patented their own which sucked. After they released it, they went ans asked Synaptics for help. posted on yesterday, 04:12 0 Reply 9. NewroticSlob (Posts: 123; Member since: 09 May 2013) They don't say in this article that Apple was the first to utilize it. Since Apple uses LCD screens, the differences between LCD and OLED screens would require a solution for the differences. What the differences are? NOT A CLUE! :) Not a screen techie. But no need to get upset due to something they didn't say. Personally, I'm not sure I'd be a fan of pressure sensitive screens. As the author stated, with Android's built-in ability to do what iOS doesn't allow (widgets, etc) seems a bit of a waste of time and may cause more issues than it cures. Just my opinion. And I can't wait for the Note 8! Love my Note 5 but wish I had more storage. posted on yesterday, 04:49 0 Reply 16. mazallah (Posts: 17; Member since: 29 Jul 2016) Uhm in the article it says that Huawei is basically using the same pressure sensor as Apple. Which in my perspective translates to something partial and made to look like Apple founded the tech. posted on yesterday, 06:31 0 Reply 23. NewroticSlob (Posts: 123; Member since: 09 May 2013) True... but it's for LCD screens. Unless Huawei uses LCD screens Apple would be the first, I think. Either way, not enough to get upset about. :) posted on yesterday, 04:16 2 Reply 11. Plasticsh1t (Posts: 1394; Member since: 01 Sep 2014) Monkey see monkey do.

ADVERTISE SUBSCRIBE CONTACT ABOUT GEAR Arrival of iOS 11 could ‘brick’ close to 200,000 apps by John Kennedy 1 day ago17 Shares Broken iPhone. Image: Martchan/Shutterstock Apple’s next mobile OS could brick apps that aren’t optimised for 64-bit computing. An estimated 187,000 apps could be rendered useless with the advent of Apple’s next mobile operating system, iOS 11. This because they won’t be compatible with 64-bit processors. For some time, Apple has been encouraging app developers to update their apps to be compatible with the 64-bit processors that arrived with iPhone 5S. Now they won’t have a choice. Apple is getting aggressive and its message is blunt: update to 64-bit or be removed. Preventing app rot In its latest iOS 10 beta, Apple has changed the language from “this app may slow down your iPhone” to “this app will not work with future versions of iOS” in relation to older 32-bit apps. According to app analytics company Sensor Tower, 187,000 apps will be incompatible with the next operating system from Apple. This amounts to between 8pc and 10pc of all apps in the App Store. iOS 11 is likely to debut as a beta around the time of the Worldwide Developers Conference before going on general release in late summer or early autumn. Apple has always paid close attention to the quality of apps in the App Store and it removed more than 43,000 apps last year, according to Mashable. Apple introduced 64-bit chipsets in September 2013 but it wasn’t until 2015 that the company began requiring developers to support the new architecture. How will the upcoming ‘app-pocalypse’ affect users? It’s hard to say, really, because many of the apps, if they are revenue-earners, would be kept up to date by developers. But if you have beloved apps such as games or productivity tools that you have kept using for years, and they are still in 32-bit format, be afraid. Broken iPhone.

German government considers law penalising social media sites for hate speech German justice minister Heiko Maas has proposed a new anti-hate-speech law that could see social media giants such as Facebook and Twitter hit by penalties of up to €50m (£44m) if they fail to remove illegal racist and xenophobic content (The Guardian). Maas said that he's proposing the law due to the failure of voluntary measures adopted by social media companies in Germany, which he said have "proved insufficient, and (illegal posts) are not being deleted quickly enough". The draft law, which will have to be approved by the German cabinet and parliament, states that social networks must provide a clear and easy method of reporting hate speech, that reports should be reviewed quickly, and that illegal content should be deleted within 24 hours. Meanwhile, in the UK, Facebook has said that it's tweaked its community standards review system in response to the discovery of child sexual abuse content on its platform, which was not removed when BBC investigative journalists reported it.

Apple found guilty of iPhone price fixing Russia's Federal Antimonopoly Service - the country's antitrust watchdog - has announced that Apple has been found guilty of fixing the price of iPhones in Russia for years (The Verge). The FAS says that if local retailers attempted to lower the price at which they sold iPhones, Apple would first request that they change the price back, and, if they didn't do go, terminate their contract. Apple reportedly has three months to appeal against the ruling and stands to be fined up to 15 per cent of the value of its Russian sales. However, the regulator said that Apple has cooperated with the investigation and ended its price fixing practices, putting in place protocols and training to prevent it from happening again. 3. Netflix hires Hollywood insider to grow its production efforts Netflix has hired Hollywood producer Scott Stuber to help it gain traction with the traditional motion picture industry (Engadget). Although the streaming media firm received its first Academy Award this year, for short Syrian war documentary The White Helmets, it hasn't won the same favour with the Hollywood establishment as rival Amazon, largely due to its emphasis on streaming, rather than theatrical releases. Stuber, known for films including Battleship and Ted has been brought in to help bridge that gap, and to aid filmmakers in developing movies with the streaming platform in mind. The company has also acquired the rights to Orson Welles' unfinished film The Other Side of the Wind, which it plans to complete with the aid of original cast and crew including lead actor Peter Bogdanovich and production manager Frank Marshall. 4. DeepMind's new AI system can learn based on its past experiences A team of Google DeepMind and Imperial College London researchers has created an algorithm that allows neural networks to learn, retain the information, and use it again (WIRED). "Previously, we had a system that could learn to play any game, but it could only learn to play one game," James Kirkpatrick, a research scientist at DeepMind and the lead author of its new research paper, tells WIRED. "Here we are demonstrating a system that can learn to play several games one after the other". The paper, Overcoming catastrophic forgetting in neural networks, explains how DeepMind's AI can learn in sequences using supervised learning and reinforcement learning tests. "Our approach remembers old tasks by selectively slowing down learning on the weights important for those tasks," the paper says. Kirkpatrick explains that the algorithm selects what it learned to successfully play one game and keeps the most useful parts. "We only allow them to change very slowly," he says. "That way there is room to learn the new task but the changes we've applied do not override what we've learned before".

Chile's next solar plant will be able to operate 24 hours a day Chile is set to become the home of a revolutionary solar thermal power plant, capable of generating electricity even during the hours of darkness (Ars Technica). The Tamarugal Solar Energy Project is to consist of three 150 megawatt solar thermal towers, heated by an array of mirrors placed around them to focus sunlight on each tower. That heat energy is transferred to molten salt - a combination of sodium nitrate and potassium nitrate kept at 566 degrees Celsius - which will circulate around the plant's heat exchangers during the day and be stored in tanks at night. Because the molten salt holds heat so effectively, in dark or cloudy conditions it can be pumped back to the thermal towers, where it will generate electricity by super-heading water to move a traditional steam turbine. The plant, designed by US firm SolarReserve, will be able to able to provide 450 MW of power continuously, and as much as 2,600 GWh annually.

Study: content filters do little to protect teenagers online A new study published in The Journal of Pediatrics has cast doubt on the effectiveness of parental controls and content filters as a means of protecting teenagers online (The Register). Researchers from the Oxford Internet Institute at Oxford University analysed Ofcom data on 515 adolescents between the ages of 12 and 15, and found that the use of content filters in the home - in use in a third of the households involved - "did not appear to mitigate the risk of young people having unpleasant online experiences and that technical ability to bypass these filters had no observed effect on the likelihood of such experiences". The researchers instead suggest that the best way to protect young people from having adverse experiences online would be to provide education and support to help them use the internet responsibly.

Einstein's theory of relativity is being tested using a gyroscope deep underground A laser-based gyroscope has been buried deep in Earth’s core to measure the rotation of our planet (WIRED). The ambitious experiment, described in a new paper in the journal Review of Scientific Instruments, should be precise enough to reveal the effects of Einstein's general theory of relativity. A group from the Italian National Institute for Nuclear Physics' (INFN) Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS) has created a prototype of the underground experiment. The setup will measure the precession Earth undergoes due to a relativistic effect called the Lense-Thirring effect. When a massive object like the Earth rotates, it effectively drags space and time around itself. "This effect is detectable as a small difference between the Earth's rotation rate value measured by a ground-based observatory, and the value measured in an inertial reference frame," said Jacopo Belfi, lead author of the paper. 8. Watch Nintendo's three part Breath of Wild documentary Nintendo has released a half hour long documentary in three parts, going into intimate detail about the origins and development of Nintendo Switch hit The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (Eurogamer). The documentaries include interviews, art and footage of the game's prototypes, and provide glimpses of unused concepts such as a 2.5D version of the game and the return of the pint-sizes Picori race from The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap. 9. System Shock 3 has a publisher System Shock 3, Otherside Entertainment's planned sequel to Looking Glass Technologies' seminal action RPGs of the '90s, has signed a publishing detail with Sweden's Starbreeeze Studios (RockPaperShotgun). The move means that the game, developed by Warren Spector, the legendary industry figure behind the original System Shock and Deus Ex games, will be coming to "PC and other platforms" thanks to a $12 million investment from Starbreeze. Otherside CEO Paul Neurath, himself a veteran designer and director behind titles including Ultima Underworld and Thief: The Dark Project said: “We are thrilled to be partnering with Starbreeze for System Shock 3. They truly get games and gamers, and have been able to translate that understanding into a robust publishing business, and build thriving gaming communities around their franchises”. 10. You can now play unreleased beast fighting game Primal Rage II Primal Rage II - sequel to post-apocalyptic one-on-one beast fighting arcade and console hit Primal Rage - never saw an official release, but is now available to play thanks to a tweaked version of the MAME emulator created by Urthrage fansite owner Gruntzilla94 (Kotaku). The emulator can be downloaded for Windows as a set of three 7-Zip files, although you'll need to find and download the game ROMs separately for legal reasons. Primal Rage II, although incomplete and never officially released, was discovered in an arcade in 2014, but this is the first time it's been successfully emulated on home computers.

The thoughts and opinions expressed are those of the writer and not Gamasutra or its parent company.   MonoGame (for those of you not yet aware) is a Game Building Framework / API born from the ashes that was the Microsoft XNA Framework that provides a very easy to use API to build games. (or 3D Apps) What makes MonoGame far better than its XNA heritage, is that MonoGame is built from the ground up to be multi-platform, supporting many of today’s modern platforms, including: Android iOS / MacOS Windows 8 / Windows 10 Linux Even Consoles And many more (still growing) MonoGame has even extended the Content pipeline that XNA introduces (an asset management system) to also make assets like Art, Textures, Models and so on, work for every platform from a single configuration / building platform.  Check out the MonoGame Framework on their awesome site with an even more awesome URL: http://MonoGame.Rocks (Sooo cool) They truly believe in the “Build it once, Ship everywhere” moto. Welcome to 2017 As of March 2017, Microsoft has now released their next generation development management suite called Visual Studio 2017 (actually I’m running out of different things to call Visual Studio with all the hats it wears).  Visual Studio enables developers to Build / Manage / Deploy and maintain almost any software solution, especially on the Cloud. With this new big release, the Monogame also kept pace and released the latest version of the framework, MonoGame 3.6, which includes full support for Visual Studio 2017. You can check out the full details on the 3.6 release on http://MonoGame.Rocks MonoGame 3.6 March 1, 2017 by Tom Spilman in News, Releases We are happy to say that MonoGame 3.6 is now available for download. Thanks as always to all the hard work from the MG developer community that made this release possible! MonoGame 3.6 for VisualStudio MonoGame 3.6 for MacOS MonoGame 3.6 Pipeline GUI Tool for MacOS standalone installer MonoGame 3.6 for Linux MonoGame 3.6 Source Code On GitHub MonoGame 3.6 Assemblies on NuGet You can read about the major fixes and features in our new change log. Like its predecessor Visual 2015, Visual Studio 2017 has full free support (thanks to Microsoft’s acquisition of Xamarin) for deploying to all of these platforms now. So it makes this open source FREE framework even better to pick up and start building with. Why not Unity, Unreal or Other Game thing X? When you are picking the Game Development framework or engine to start with (or jump to), it’s important to choose what you want to build your game / project in using something that suits your development style. Unity and Unreal have a great editor / GUI experience with some coding required, so it’s a good fit if you like drag and drop. Scratch / Game maker and others offer a much more stripped down and basic experience meant to wet your appetite. Although I have seen some serious projects built with these XNA / FNA / MonoGame on the other hand, are a full coded experience. So if you prefer to control all the bits of your game and not rely on things being done for you, it’s a better fit. There are those who then also like to go even lower but we shall not mention such things so as not to scare the birds, lest they fly away. My advice (as ever) has always been to choose what is the right fit for YOU and go with it.  If you end up getting lost, then try something else until you find the right home for YOU. Game Development is a very personal thing and the tool you choose should be your choice!   Getting Started with MonoGame using Visual Studio Now I get many questions or queries are posted on the MonoGame GitHub site and its accompanying Community forums about how to get started with MonoGame, how to build for platform X or where the nearest coffee shop is where I can start coding. Sadly, the last I usually struggle with as I down my 5th latte for the day and it’s only 10am . All of this prompted me to pick up the recording devices and record two video sessions, which you can check out below: Each video has links to the source slides in the comments and walks through: What platforms are supported out of the box with each version What you need to get running with Android What you need to get running with iOS / MacOS What you need to get running with Windows 8 / Windows 10 Each also including hints/tips and gotcha's for each platform (that relate to MonoGame, not how to setup an Apple ID) The long version When I record such videos (as above), I also like to follow up with the slightly longer text version (just because some prefer not to watch videos).  It’s a bit more work and sometimes when it’s written down it’s easier to refer to.  So I’ll run through here a summation of the videos. Getting Started with Visual Studio 2015 (Slides for reference, can be found here on SlideShare) 1. Clean Visual Studio 2015 Install When you install Visual Studio 2015 using the default options, you have a fully working .NET development environment, with MonoGame installed you get access to the following platforms: Windows Desktop DX (classic) Cross-Platform OpenGL (Linux / Windows / Etc) Content Pipeline Extensions With these projects, you have enough to get you “up and running” and start building your first game using MonoGame.  Each template includes all the necessary setup and boiler plate, including your first Game class “Game.cs”, which includes the all important game loop in which your game runs. Following any of the many tutorials or samples using these templates will set you on a nice easy to follow course for your first few projects.  You can even ship titles on these platforms via Steam or your distribution option of choice.  Either way there is a lot of help to get started. If you are intending to build a true “multi-platform” project, then I also recommend checking out one of my other videos for how to setup your project in the best way: http://bit.ly/monogamemulti-platform If you are just starting out or want to “test” a new project, then you don’t need the above. Just start your new project, roll up your sleeves, brew a fresh pot of your favourite cup and start coding. 2. Building for Android When you want to start tackling Android as your target platform, then you will need a few extra bits installed with your Visual Studio 2015 setup, namely:     The Xamarin Core module (C#/.NET Xamarin)     Android SDK for target builds     Android NDK (native dev kit) for target builds     Optionally, you can also install the Microsoft Visual Studio Android emulator This will give you all the components you need for getting up and running with Android using the MonoGame Android template.  However, Android is a very fragmented platform and in all likelihood, you may need several projects or deployments in order to meet your distribution goals, such is the world of Android today. My best advice is to survey the markets you want to deploy your game in to, gather the different API types and versions you will need to support those (as well as the capabilities of each device) and plan from there.  Having too few supported device types likely will mean too few installs to be profitable. Too many will mean you have a huge headache to maintain your game. If you follow the earlier advice for setting up a multi-platform project, this overall overhead will be greatly reduced, but it will always be a battle to keep up to date. P.S. if you can, avoid the Google device emulator and you will keep some sanity in reserve for when you desperately need it. That thing is just a nightmare sadly.  Use the Microsoft Android emulator instead, provided your machine can support running it (min 8GB memory required), else use physical devices for test. Another service to also think about using is either the Xamarin Test Cloud or the recently announced Azure Mobile test (http://mobile.azure.com). These platforms will test your android project on as many devices as you with and give you a full range of stats for how well it runs and what issues the devices may have. The new Azure solution is currently in preview so it’s free to use for now, so check it out while it’s free. 3. Building for iOS / MacOS The setup for iOS is a little easier, as you only need the Xamarin Core module (C#/.NET Xamarin) installed with Visual Studio 2015. If you have already setup for Android, then you have everything you need ON YOUR WINDOWS MACHINE! However, to build for any Apple development platform you are going to need a MAC (in fact if you want to build for MacOS with MonoGame, you can ONLY do it from a Mac. No Widows dev for you. You’ll need either Xamarin or the new Visual Studio for Mac there, ON YOUR MAC).  This is required in order to build your code for deployment to a device or the Apple Store, part of the locked in culture of Apple development. You can pick up a Mac Mini quite cheaply (I paid £50 for mine) provided it can support the following criteria:     It supports the latest version of the iOS SDK.     The latest version of Xcode.     Has Mac OS X Yosemite(10.10) & above installed.   You will also need an Apple Dev Center account registered and assigned to your device.  If your prospective device does not support the above, don’t buy it as you will just be wasting your money to use it for development If you want to use Xamarin’s extended capabilities with the Mac Build host or the Mac development environment, you’ll likely need to fork out for either a Xamarin License or use your MSDN subscription, either will do. For more details on setting up your Mac so that Visual Studio can build against it, see this post: https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/ios/getting_started/installation/mac/ 4. Building for Windows 8.1 / Windows Mobile 8.1 To build for Windows 8.1, you still need a few extra bits. Mainly the development SDKs for Windows 8.1 and if you wish, the Phone emulators: You will also need a Windows Store account to publish your game to the Windows Store as well, however, this is now a onetime low fee and then you have it for LIFE.  Not a bad investment since it also gives you access to publish UWP games as well (see below). 5. Building for Windows 10 UWP To build for Windows 10, like with Windows 8, you simply need the SDK’s for the versions of the Windows 10 UWP framework you intend to use, for MonoGame the minimum SDK’s you need are: 10240 & 10586. As newer SDK versions come out, grab them. Thankfully everything you need is installed by simply selecting the “Universal Windows App Development Tools” node in the Visual Studio Installer: You will also need to configure your Windows 10 machine in “Developer Mode” in order to side deploy and debug new UWP games on your machine.  When you first try to create a new UWP project or open an existing gone, Visual Studio with prompt you and take you to the settings page, which can be found here: Settings -> Update & Security -> For Developers Getting Started with Visual Studio 2017 (Slides for reference, can be found here on SlideShare) The new Visual Studio 2017 installer is a lot more lightweight than what we had in 2015. It’s a lot more streamlined and very similar to the Web Platform Installer for web solutions (if you have used that). By default, NOTHING is selected and all you will install is the Core Visual Studio framework and editor.  All you can do with this is inspect existing projects and create new blank solutions, functional but you can’t do much.  TO get going you will need to explore some of the additional components / modules. 1. Clean Visual Studio 2017 Install If you install just the Core Visual Studio 2017 and MonoGame, you won’t be able to do anything, the templates will not even show up.  To get started you will need a minimum of the .NET desktop development module: With this you have pretty much the same as in the default install of 2015, namely the ability to create projects in: Windows Desktop DX (classic)     Cross-Platform OpenGL (Linux / Windows / Etc)     Content Pipeline Extensions As before, if you are just “playing” or testing, then fire up a new project and play.  If you are starting a new “proper” project, then I recommend you setup the project right from the beginning, as highlighted in my Multi-Platform solution setup video: http://bit.ly/monogamemulti-platform   2. Building for Android To build for Android you need to check the “Mobile Development with .NET” module: In this module you will need to check the additional properties pane on the right-hand side of the installer to ensure you have the additional components selected that you require for MonoGame development, as shown here: Just check you have the current Android NDK and SDK’s selected and you will be fine.  There is one thing to take note of though, that the Microsoft Android Emulator is NOT available from this module (as well as other optional Android NDK/SDK libraries).  If you want these additional features, then you will also have to check out the “Mobile Development Kit with C++” as shown here: 3. Building for iOS As with 2015, if you have installed an Android development setup, then you already have the necessary bits for iOS development in Visual Studio 2017, namely the “Mobile Development with .NET” module You’ll still have to get a MAC as a build host to build your projects (and a Mac to develop on for Mac development).  Check the section for 2015 for more details, it’s exactly the same. 4. Building for Windows 10 UWP Windows 10 development with Visual Studio 2017 has its own module as shown here: However, as with Android, you will need to inspect the Properties panel on the right-hand side of the installer to ensure you have all the necessary components needed for MonoGame, specifically the SDK’s.   By default, only the Anniversary SDK (14393) is installed, for MonoGame you will also need 10240 & 10586, so be sure to select them.  This will ensure you have the widest coverage of Windows 10 devices out there. You can leave them out if you wish but you will have to Edit your project definition or be very careful with your Minimum and Target Platform selections when you create your project, else you’ll get lots of “errors”!! *NOTE, a late reported issue was fixed in MonoGame for standalone installs of Visual Studio 2017! It was discovered that if Visual Studio 2017 was installed on top of / alongside Visual Studio 2015, it behaved differently and “just worked”.  However, when Visual Studio 2017 was install on its own or on a clean machine, the templates would simply not work. A fix has already been delivered but it was after the MonoGame 3.6 release.  To use Visual Studio 2017 on its own, use the current “Development” release of MonoGame until a point release is submitted.  There is currently very little difference between 3.6 and the development release, so it’s completely fine. Now you are up and running With Visual Studio setup correctly and with the latest version 3.6 release of MonoGame installed, you should have everything you need to start building your game in MonoGame. Feel free to check out the other videos on my channel or the full list of “Recommended” MonoGame tutorials listed on the site to get going. (although to be honest, almost any XNA 4.0 tutorial will do) I’ll be doing some more beginner sessions soon, so stay tuned.   Related Jobs Disruptor Beam — FRAMINGHAM, Massachusetts, United States [03.16.17] Mobile Software Engineer Qualcomm — SAN DIEGO, California, United States [03.15.17] Graphics Software Engineer Pixar Animation Studios — Emeryville, California, United States [03.15.17] Animation Tools Software Engineer Crate Entertainment — Boston Area (or work remotely), Massachusetts, United States [03.15.17] Senior Programmer [View All Jobs] 293471 blog /blogs/SimonJackson/20170310/293471/Getting_Started_with_MonoGame_using_Visual_Studio.php 950036 33861463 Loading Comments TECHNOLOGY GROUP Black Hat Content Marketing Institute Content Marketing World Dark Reading Enterprise Connect Fusion GDC Gamasutra HDI ICMI InformationWeek Interop ITX Network Computing No Jitter VRDC COMMUNITIES SERVED Content Marketing Enterprise IT Enterprise Communications Game Development Information Security IT Services & Support WORKING WITH US Advertising Contacts Event Calendar Tech Marketing Solutions Contact Us Licensing Terms of Service Privacy Statement Copyright © 2017 UBM, All rights reserved

Apple Faces Fine in Russia After Being Charged with Fixing iPhone Prices GO Russia’s anti-monopoly agency found Apple guilty Mar 15, 2017 08:11 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Last August, Russia’s Federal Antimonopoly Services launched an investigation into Apple over alleged price-fixing of iPhones sold in the country. Apple denied any involvement in the matter and stated that retailers set their own prices for products. After a lengthy investigation, Russian officials reached the conclusion that Apple had indeed fixed prices of iPhones in the country, according to The Financial Times. The company was found guilty of fixing prices of the iPhone 5 and iPhone 6 models. Apple had instructed 16 retailers in Russia to set prices for the two iPhone models at a certain level. If a retailer didn’t comply and set the price at an “unsuitable” level, Apple would order them to change the price or risk having the sales agreement terminated. Prices for multiple iPhone models were fixed The report mentions that Apple had imposed a certain price for iPhone 5c, iPhone 5s, iPhone 6, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus for three months after their official launch in Russia. Apple has yet to comment on the matter, but Russian officials stated that the Cupertino company cooperated during the whole investigation. Apple now has three months to file a challenge to the ruling, and in the worst case scenario, the company could be fined with 15% of its sales in Russia. However, a resolution in the matter will possibly be reached in a few months. This is essentially likely, as any product that reaches retailers has a manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP), also referred to as recommended retail price (RRP). MSRP is the price at which the manufacturer recommends that the retailers sell the product. It was introduced in order to standardize prices among locations, so that a certain product would cost roughly the same at all retailers around the world. Of course, a number of costs must be taken into account when setting the price of a product. #Apple#iPhone#Antimonopoly charges#iPhone 6s Plus#Price fixing subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Apple Is Top Smartphone Maker in the US, Samsung Falls Second Apple Claims It Has Already Patched Exploits Unveiled in Latest CIA Leaks Apple and Samsung Reputations Declined Dramatically in the Past Year Apple Ends Contract with Server Company After Finding Security Issues Samsung Galaxy S8 Features Camera and Iris Scanner Improvements LibreOffice 5.3 Office Suite Gets First Point Release with 100 Improvements Study: 96% of Websites Get Attacked by Bad Bots Windows 10 Creators Update Hides a Secret Ad Switch, Privacy Group Warns YouTube Discontinues Annoying Annotations LXLE 16.04.2 GNU/Linux Distro to Bring All the Goodies from Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS Netflix Turns to Thumbs Up/Down Ratings, Ditches 5-Stars System Intel Launches Bug Bounty Program, Offers Rewards of Up to $30,000    iPhone 6s Plus and iPhone 6 Plus new ios apps NeuroNation: Train your brain to improve your memory and focus with NeuroNation Flipagram: Create cool videos by mixing up your photos with music Timer+: Set up dozens of timers and control them all with ease Nutshell Camera: Create some pretty cool videos with Nutshell Camera IKEA Catalogue: Check out the IKEA Catalogue for more than just furniture Complete: Complete puts a social twist to your regular to-do list/ task manager WebMD Baby: WebMD Baby offers help in how to best tend to your baby Reader comments Eye iPhone Case Runs Stock Android and Brings Back Headphone Jack more on: Eye case i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

Russia’s Federal Antimonopoly Service on Tuesday, March 14 said Apple’s Russian subsidiary hadillegally ordered retailers to fix prices of its iPhone 5 and iPhone 6 products, a charge that could lead to the California-based company being fined. Apple had instructed 16 Russian retailers to hold the prices of its iPhone models and contacted them in the event that any products were being sold at “inappropriate” prices, the FAS saidin a statement after a seven-month investigation, adding that it suspected Apple was able to terminate sale agreements with retailers if pricing guidelines were not met. When the investigation was announced in August, Apple denied the charge and said that resellers set their own prices for products in Russia and other markets. On Tuesday, a spokesperson said: “We worked closely with FAS during their investigation and are glad to put this matter behind us. We work hard to make the best products and services in the world for our customers and are deeply committed to making sure our resellers are able to compete fairly in the markets where we do business.” “In the course of the proceedings the Russian subsidiary of Apple actively co-operated with the FAS,” said the agency’s deputy head, Andrey Tsarikovsky. “The company has adopted the necessary measures to eliminate violations of the law and is pursuing a policy to prevent similar violations in the future.” The ruling comes seven months after Russia’s anti-monopoly agency found Googleguilty of violating competition regulations by forcing smartphone manufacturers to give Google products prominence on their devices. The US technology company was fined 438m roubles ($7.4m). Russia’s FAS, which in 2011 also fined two mobile operators for price-fixing iPhone 4 models, opened its case against Apple after a consumer complaint. Apple will have three months to challenge the decision in court after the full decision is published later this month, Tsarikovsky added. Any fine under the anti-monopoly regulations could be as much as 15 per cent of Apple’s Russian unit’s sales, but would be decided in a few months, Tsarikovsky told Russia’s Interfax news agency. In June 2015, a New York appeals court ruled that Apple was guilty of conspiring with five publishers to fix the prices of ebooks, resulting in some ebook prices rising to $12.99 or $14.99 from the market leader Amazon’s $9.99 price, according to the US Justice Department. Apple ended up agreeing to pay a $450m settlement to US consumers as compensation in 2016, after the US Supreme Court declined to hear Apple's challenge. The Russian iPhone probe also involved Apple Inc and a number of its international subsidiaries, but the agency said it had dropped its investigation against them due to lack of evidence.

The Cupertino behemoth has sent delegates to lobby against a proposed bill in Nebraska that will grant consumers and third-party repair chains access to service manuals, diagnostic equipment and replacement parts, BuzzFeed News reports. “We're hunting for awesome startups” Run an early-stage company? We're inviting 250 to exhibit at TNW Conference and pitch on stage! CHECK IT OUT Apple representative Steve Kester advised State Sen. Lydia Brasch against the proposed “right to repair” bill, warning the proposal could turn Nebraska into a “Mecca for bad actors” if passed. According to Kester, the act poses a large threat to consumers as it could grant hackers hardware-level access to company products. The Big A has consistently voiced its preference that its products should only be handled by certified technicians. Samsung and John Deere have similarly argued the proposed legislation could expose industry secrets and compromise security and safety concerns. Tech industry groups, including CompTIA, the Consumer Technology Association and the Information Technology Industry council have also taken a stance against the bill. Curiously, the groups represent some the leading names in technology like Microsoft, Google, Nintendo and Sony. Among other things, the opposers argue the bill would “compromise intellectual property” and complicate safety regulations. They further claim consumers already have “substantial choice when it comes to visiting the repair facility that best suits their needs” as it is. While Apple products are notoriously difficult to repair, the bill could make it easier to fix other consumer electronics that require less effort and skill to patch up. But on the other hand, putting the “right to repair” in the hands of unqualified DIY repair aficionados opens the door for an uncontrolled stream of potentially dangerous “quick fixes.” Still, as Repair Association executive director Gay Gordon-Byrne says, “[w]e should be able to repair the things we buy.” Read next: Twitter might hide your profile from others and not tell you about it AppleGeariPhone Share on Facebook (327) Share on Twitter (262) Mix is a reporter from Amsterdam.

Now it seems that a new report contradicts the earlier release claim. Instead, the upcoming iPad Pro 2 launch could happen at the same time Apple inaugurates its brand new Apple Campus. According to Digitimes, major Taiwanese suppliers have been claiming that Apple has moved the production for the 10.5-inch iPad Pro 2 this month. This is in direct contradiction to earlier claims that the production is scheduled somewhere between May and June. Now it seems that Apple has decided to move the production earlier and that the official release could be sooner. According to the same report, Apple will be unveiling the forthcoming iPad Pro in April. This will coincide with the inauguration of Apple’s newest California headquarters. The Taiwanese supply chain said that production targets for the said iPad Pro will reach somewhere around one million just for March alone. This production figure will be upgraded to 1.2 million by the start of the second quarter of 2017. iPad Pro (via apple.com) On other notes, Apple is expecting to move between three to four million 9.7-inch iPad Pro units a month during the second quarter of the year. Unfortunately, the report did not specify any numbers about the 12.9-inch iPad Pro. However, the source said that production for the bigger iPad Pro 2 will start somewhere between May and June this year. Right now, there are rumors that Apple is testing a handful of iPad Pro 2 units in its Cupertino headquarters. A collection of iPad Pro serial numbers were rounded up by mobile market researcher Fisku. According to the report released by Tech Crunch, the iPad Pro models for this year will have the serial numbers 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, and 7.4. While it may look like Apple is testing out four different iPad Pros, these serial numbers could pertain to WiFi and LTE versions of both the 10.5- and 12.9-inch models. Apple is yet to make an official announcement about the supposed April event. Whether or not the iPad Pro 2 will be released on the said month, only Apple can tell.

Editorial Director at Mobile Nations, analyst at iMore, video and podcast host, you can follow him @reneritchie on Snapchat, Instagram, and Twitter. Security and forensics expert Jonathan Zdziarski is joining Apple's Security Engineering and Architecture team. And that's a huge win for personal privacy. Previously, Jonathan Zdziarski wrote code that eventually led to much of the modern digital forensic and data extraction tools. More recently, he made Little Flocker to protect people from digital intrusion and wrote about defending data at border crossings and guarding against phishing attacks. Now he's moving on... to Apple! From zdziarski.com: I'm pleased to announce that I've accepted a position with Apple's Security Engineering and Architecture team, and am very excited to be working with a group of like minded individuals so passionate about protecting the security and privacy of others. This decision marks the conclusion of what I feel has been a matter of conscience for me over time. Privacy is sacred; our digital lives can reveal so much about us – our interests, our deepest thoughts, and even who we love. I am thrilled to be working with such an exceptional group of people who share a passion to protect that. Apple's Security Engineering and Architecture team, which I think is still part of CoreOS under SVP Craig Federighi's software engineering org, is beyond terrific. Led by Ivan Krstić, it's been responsible for everything from hardening iOS, to Gate Keeper and System Integrity Protection on the Mac, to the Bug Bounty program announced late last year. Because Apple's business isn't dependent on selling ads against customer data, and because from CEO Tim Cook on down, Apple deeply believes in customer privacy, the company is able to make security and privacy a front-facing feature. Not just in the code but in the policy and the willingness to stand up for it. We live in a time where governments around the world, conservative and liberal alike, are abandoning and even assaulting personal privacy in the name of security. In the current climate, not storing our data is the best way to prevent multiple collection vectors. Creating tools like differential privacy are the best ways to preserve our anonymity while still providing convenient services. Locking down devices with encryption even the manufacturer can't get into is the best way to keep hackers and foreign powers out of those devices. That's what makes Apple the perfect place for Jonathan to continue his journey. (And his photography!) Congrats to Jonathan and to Apple and the security team! I look very much forward to being even better protected by your code in the future!

I sure hope it's the former, and would love to have someone to trust... but Apple has been doing enough anti-UX and customer things, as of late, that I do have to wonder. -3 2 days ago Reply cuttheredwire Look him up for yourself and decide: https://www.zdziarski.com/blog/?p=5645 0 2 days ago Reply SteveW928 Oh, I agree. He's been a strong advocate. I'm just saying that *if* one were trying to pull something like that, he's the type of person you'd want to have on your team, and not out in the wild, possibly opposing you. He'd also know what people like him would be looking for, etc. Again, Apple seems genuine re: privacy, and I think Jonathan seems like an honest person. It was just something I was pointing out. :) (My point, though, is that lately Apple has been far from 'pure as the driven snow' in terms of where their priorities are.) -1 2 days ago Reply SteveW928 I've followed him since the FBI-Apple stuff. Interestingly, his Twitter account seems to have disappeared. 0 2 days ago Reply Fred Stein I'm thrilled to hear this news. Looking to future of wearables and IoT, the number of on-line devices doubles every 6 years (I made this up). We either have security at the device level, or not.

Problem Solving | 13 Mar 2017 | Print  | Comment (10) How to Identify High-Performance GPU Apps on the MacBook Pro by Jeff Carlson Shortly after the 2016 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar began shipping, battery life became a hot topic. Although Apple boasts up to 10 hours of performance per charge, I wasn’t seeing anything near that on my machine. I’d get maybe 4 hours. For a while, Consumer Reports refused to recommend the MacBook Pro because of battery life, although their testing methodology was questionable (see “Why We Should Care about the Consumer Reports MacBook Pro Rating,” 12 January 2017). The upside of the tempest was that Apple was able to fix some graphics and battery life issues in the macOS Sierra 10.12.2 and 10.12.3 updates. One of those problems centered around the way macOS switched between the built-in Intel graphics processor and the discrete AMD Radeon Pro graphics card available in the 15-inch models. (Although I’m writing specifically about the 2016 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, the following discussion applies equally to any MacBook Pro with a discrete graphics card.) When you launch a graphically demanding app, such as Adobe Photoshop, macOS switches to the Radeon processor, which consumes more power. When you quit the power-hungry app, the machine is supposed to turn off the discrete card and switch back to the integrated graphics processor, which offers less graphical power but doesn’t chew as much battery life. Before 10.12.3, macOS wouldn’t accurately sense that the changeover had happened and would continue to drive the display using the discrete GPU. Since applying that update, my battery life has dramatically improved. Even still, though, there are times when it seems as if my battery level is slipping away faster than I would expect given the work I’m doing. If you’re experiencing something similar, here’s how you can determine which apps are using which graphics processor and potentially track down the culprit. You have a couple of options: First, click the Battery menu bar item, which will tell you which applications are “Using Significant Energy.” That’s a fuzzy indicator, however. You can be running an application that’s using significant energy and still be using the integrated graphics processor. So, a quick trip into Activity Monitor is more helpful. Launch Activity Monitor (located in the Utilities folder in the Applications folder; you can get there quickly in the Finder by choosing Go > Utilities) and click the Energy tab. At the bottom of the window, see which graphics card is currently in use: Integrated (the Intel GPU) or “High Perf” (the high-performance Radeon GPU). If it’s the latter, you may be burning energy faster than you want. To determine which application is causing the discrete GPU to run, click the Requires High Perf GPU column to sort the list of running processes based on that attribute. You may have to click the heading twice to sort it correctly; the caret to the right of the column title should be facing down to indicate that you’re sorting in descending order. At the top of the list, the apps that say Yes are your culprits. Quit those apps. Even if you’re not actively using them, their presence can keep the discrete GPU active. The Graphics Card indicator at the bottom of the screen should switch back to Integrated. You’ll notice that Activity Monitor also includes a Time Remaining estimate. When Apple released 10.12.2, it took the unusual step of removing this information from the Battery menu bar item (see “macOS 10.12.2 Sierra Focuses on New MacBook Pros,” 13 December 2016). Happily, you can still get that information in Activity Monitor. The estimate is still just an estimate, though, and shouldn’t be taken as gospel because macOS adjusts its energy management features frequently. Nevertheless, the Time Remaining estimate can be a helpful guideline if you’re getting close to the wire. Of course, if you have to use even a single app that requires the discrete GPU, your battery life will suffer, and there’s nothing you can do about it. Similarly, even if no apps are using the discrete GPU or reporting as using significant energy, the battery may drain faster than you expect due to other factors. Especially on the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, I’ve found that turning off keyboard illumination (expand the Control Strip on the Touch Bar to reveal the keyboard brightness buttons) and reducing screen brightness can make a big difference.   Fujitsu ScanSnap Scanners — Save your business time and money with our easy-to-use small ScanSnap Scanner line.

Is your MacBook Pro with Touch Bar getting less battery life per charge than you think it should? The culprit could be applications that are forcing it to use the high-performance graphics processor. Here’s how to tell which GPU is in use and which applications to close to switch to the integrated processor. Receive comments via RSS Add a comment Richard  2017-03-13 15:31 This is brilliant and incredibly useful. I'm using a 2014 MacBook Pro but I've always wanted to see which of my application uses the discreet GPU. It looks like my only application that uses it is Lightroom. Safari has memory issues but they're not related to the GPU. Reply Greg  2017-03-13 21:16 Why would pgAdmin need the graphics card? It's the only app that was using it. pgAdmin can view Postgres databases. That doesn't seem too demanding. Is there any downside when the MBP is not running off the battery? Reply Curtis Wilcox   2017-03-15 13:08 I just downloaded the latest version (4.13) and also found it requires the "high perf. GPU." My guess it's because its GUI is made using the Qt framework and there's something about the framework that makes the Mac think it should use the discrete video card; every application made with Qt likely will do the same. I would report it to Postgres in case there's some setting they can use in the Mac build process to make the application *not* trigger use of the discrete video card. When you're not running off battery, the consequences of using the discrete video card are much less significant; you're using more electricity than necessary and may be adding wear to the cooling fans. Reply Tony Voss   2017-03-14 01:55 I use a 15" MacBook Pro as the navigational system on a yacht and power consumption is critical, especially when there is little sun or wind for power generation. For years I have used gfxCardStatus (http://gfx.io). This useful app places an extra item in the menu bar which indicates by displaying the letter i or n whether the integrated or Nvidia discrete processor is active. Pull down on the icon and it shows a list of apps requiring the external card processor. You can also switch between using Integrated only, discrete or dynamic switching. You cannot switch to 'Integrated only' if an app is already using the discrete processor. Some apps and an external display force discrete mode anyway. I have gfxCardStatus set to display a notification whenever the mode is switched. This is a useful warning when you happen to launch an app that turns on the discrete processor and comforting confirmation when you quite a culprit. I have successfully got app developers to remove unnecessary use of the discrete card and to fix an app that left it on when quitting. But if the app is no longer being maintained you may be out of luck - Bento for example. Thoroughly recommended. Reply Jeff Carlson   2017-03-14 12:17 I wanted to mention gfxCardStatus, but it's no longer actively maintained, and doesn't work reliably under Sierra (and maybe a version or two back). I used it for years, and wrote about it for TidBITS in 2011: Reply DelfM  2017-03-14 08:35 It's probably rare that you would be concerned about power consumption when you connect an external monitor, but my 2012 MacBook Pro Retina switches to the high performance graphics card when I connect an external monitor, even if none of my open applications need it. Reply Jeff Carlson   2017-03-14 12:14 Yes, I think all MacBook Pros with discrete cards switch to the GPU to power an external monitor. Reply Curtis Wilcox   2017-03-15 13:18 I don't understand why it automatically uses the discrete card when an external monitor is attached, Macs without such cards are able to use the same monitors. It also happens regardless of whether the external monitor is extending the desktop or mirroring the built-in display. At work, we always advise faculty to use the AC adapter when presenting from a laptop but it would be nice if they didn't have to. I don't have the ability to check at the moment but I wonder if screen mirroring over AirPlay or using 3rd party mirroring software triggers use of the discrete card. It would be a little ironic if they don't, given that mirroring by software almost certainly is more intensive than mirroring on a physically connected display. Reply David Redfearn   2017-03-14 13:57 I started looking at this data when I got my new MBP 15. One oddity I have noticed is that Apple Photos does not seem to use the AMD GPU. I have two Photos extensions (RAWPower and DxO) that do trigger the GPU when they are used, but when I am finished with them, the GPU is turned off. David Reply Jeff Carlson   2017-03-14 16:15 I would bet Apple tuned Photos especially so it doesn't need the GPU.

Featuring live performances and interviews with the likes of Spoon, Vince Staples, The Chainsmokers and the AirPods ad-featuring Marian Hill – alongside risers: Austin Millz, Brittany Sky and Southside – the week-long music event will mark only the second time that Apple has taken over South x Southwest, as 2014‘s then-named “iTunes Festival” takeover of the event featured performances by big names such as Coldplay, Imagine Dragons … and more. It would be a mistake to think you can just turn up to one of the company’s live shows and be greeted in with open arms, however. As with everything Apple nowadays, the event is being kept strictly exclusive – with only those wearing badges and holding wristbands able to enter the venue. A post shared by James Walker (@jamesiswalker) on Mar 13, 2017 at 12:31pm PDT While the super-secret gigs are taking place in a members-only area that has been fenced-off from the the public – though, both the Apple Music and Beats 1 social accounts have been non-stop posting from inside for venue … for those unlucky enough to have been left out in the cold. It it not yet clear if these live performances will eventually become available as audio (or video) replays that can be re-streamed by Apple Music members, but, right now at least, Beats 1 does appear to interspersing parts of its live coverage from the event in-between its regular programming. / Image Credit: @AppleMusic, @Ultra5280.

By Asha McLean | March 15, 2017 -- 04:28 GMT (21:28 PDT) | Topic: Banking The group of four banks collectively bargaining for access to the iPhone's near-field communication (NFC) technology have baulked at settling for payment alternatives such as Android Pay, calling them "unrealistic" in the Australian market. Latest Australian news ​Canberra coughs up AU$730m for Defence Technologies Fund Australia's dream to teach the world to cyber Australian CIOs increasing big data budgets in 2017: Telsyte ASD hands out government-protected cloud certification to two local players ATO and Immigration beaten by pilloried Human Services in cyber audit The Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA), Westpac Banking Corporation, the National Australia Bank (NAB), and Bendigo and Adelaide Bank have been seeking regulatory approval since mid-last year to collectively negotiate with third-party mobile providers such as Apple on conditions relating to competition, best practice standards, and efficiency. In its most recent submission [PDF] to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), the banking cartel explained that its members developed their own NFC mobile wallets on the Android platform prior to current multi-issuer mobile wallets being announced, and expressed interest in doing the same on Apple's platform. The banks also expect other providers of mobile wallets and other NFC functions to soon emerge, which they said might include merchants, telecommunications providers such as Optus Pay in Australia or Singtel and Orange internationally, and fintech startups such as Myki Plus -- an NFC app sprouting from Melbourne's public transit cards -- but only on the Android platform. "Some of these international examples have relied on the Android platform and on non-NFC point-of-sale technologies such as PIN or barcodes," the bank's submission says, adding that other countries have less NFC infrastructure in place than Australia, and that Android has a much greater presence outside of Australia, as well. "These alternatives are unrealistic in Australia, which has the world's highest adoption of contactless NFC card payments and one of the world's highest iPhone market shares, particularly among customers likely to use mobile payments," the banks said. "In Australia, potential mobile wallet providers other than Apple are locked out of the established payment infrastructure in respect of the clear majority of relevant customers." Throughout the process, the banks have claimed that they want access to the NFC controller in iPhones and reduced their argument last month to solely focus on such, as Apple currently does not allow any other entity direct access to its technology. The group has been arguing that access would enable them to offer their own integrated digital wallets to iPhone customers in competition with Apple's digital wallet without using Apple Pay -- which is what Apple wants to avoid. "To make this point abundantly clear, the applicants are willing to limit collective negotiation to NFC access alone -- ie, the ability to collectively negotiate for the removal of the pass-through restriction will be taken off the table," the cartel said earlier this year. The banks' comments come after Apple argued in its submission to the ACCC previously that the collective application is not about access to the iPhone's NFC technology; rather, it is an attempt to avoid paying the fees associated with using Apple Pay. Apple noted that it "will not, and cannot, agree to the terms sought by the banks". The latest submissions from both the banking cartel and Apple are in response to a draft determination handed down by the ACCC in November that moved to deny the banks collective bargaining rights against the iPhone maker. "This is currently a finely balanced decision. The ACCC is not currently satisfied that the likely benefits from the proposed conduct outweigh the likely detriments," ACCC chairman Rod Sims said at the time. "While the ACCC accepts that the opportunity for the banks to collectively negotiate and boycott would place them in a better bargaining position with Apple, the benefits are currently uncertain and may be limited." In their latest submission, the banks held firm that NFC access would create opportunities to invest in NFC capabilities that do not exist without access. Particularly in a relatively small market like Australia, the banks said that larger addressable market provided by NFC access on the iPhone platform increases the incentives to invest, and would reduce the cost and risk of failure and enhance the likely chances of success. "Apple already provides access to many third-party apps that send and receive information through iPhone hardware features such as the camera, microphone, speaker, and Bluetooth interfaces. These apps can access the iPhone's hardware without having to launch an Apple app," the banks said. "As a result, there has been a proliferation of innovative apps that use the iPhone camera for purposes Apple could not have imagined. There is no reason why the NFC function should be treated differently, and the Android platform shows that multiple applications can use the NFC function as seamlessly as they can use any other hardware feature."

International Business Times UK UK World Business Politics Fintech Technology Science Sport Entertainment Opinion Video Pictures Log out Newsletter Signup Technology CyberSecurity WikiLeaks claims to have contacted Google, Apple, Microsoft and others about CIA cyberweapons Julian Assange had previously vowed to provide tech firm with 'exclusive access' to CIA malware. By India Ashok March 15, 2017 04:49 GMT Close Top five revelations from Wikileaks' 'Vault 7' Vincent Balestriere WikiLeaks has claimed it has reached out to tech firms, including Google, Apple, Microsoft, Mozilla and MicroTik regarding alleged CIA cyberweapons and malware. The whistle-blowing platform tweeted it has made contact to help firms "protect users against CIA malware". Founder Julian Assange had previously vowed to provide tech firms with "exclusive access" to WikiLeaks' trove of alleged CIA hacking tools, in efforts to help firms issue out security patches to protect customers. However, as of last weekend, WikiLeaks was yet to deliver on its promise. Reports claimed that Google and Microsoft were yet to be contacted by the transparency platform. A Microsoft spokesperson had also claimed that the firm preferred that those with knowledge of security issues contact them via a secure email address. However, a Microsoft spokesperson has confirmed that WikiLeaks has reached out to the firm. "WikiLeaks has made initial contact with us via secure@microsoft.com," the Microsoft spokesperson told The Register. Google, Samsung, Apple and Microsoft, all whose products are allegedly affected by the CIA hacking tools have previously claimed that they were looking into the issue. Google and Apple claimed to have already issued out patches as part of their latest security updates, to protect customers from potential harm from security flaws disclosed by WikiLeaks. There has been no official comment or confirmation from Silicon Valley giants about WikiLeaks having contacted them regarding CIA cyberweapons. The legitimacy of the leaked details on CIA's hacking tools and techniques is yet to be verified by the spy agency or by other security specialists. Meanwhile, investigators looking into how WikiLeaks got its hands on the alleged classified data, suspect that CIA contractors, disgruntled over recent job losses, may have handed over sensitive material to the whistle-blowing platform. Authorities have reportedly questioned several CIA contractors and have honed in on a small group of developers working with the spy agency's engineering department, which is responsible for developing cyber tools for operations. It remains unclear, however, as to how effective WikiLeaks' offer to help tech firms develop security patches and protect users against potential threats, may be in reality. The Shadow Brokers' NSA cyberweapons dump saw firms like Cisco scramble to issue patches before vulnerabilities cold be exploited by malicious hackers. Given that WikiLeaks has indicated that its Vault 7 dump is only a miniscule part of a much larger dump, the possibilities of security flaws being exploited by hackers may be higher than expected.

The country's Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) said Apple's local subsidiary told 16 retailers in Russia to fix the prices of iPhone 5 and 6 models, according to a report by the Financial Times (subscription required).  The ruling means Apple could face a fine of up to 15 percent of its Russian sales, the report said. The company will have three months to appeal after the full decision is published later this month. Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The ruling comes as regulators in Europe have been increasingly scrutinizing American tech companies. Last year, the Russian competition watchdog found Google guilty of forcing smartphone makers to feature the company's own services more prominently on Android phones. Regulators in Europe have also been cracking down on Google and Facebook when it comes to hate speech and fake news. Regarding the price-fixing case, if a retailer sold an iPhone at an "inappropriate" price, Apple sent emails to those retailers asking them to change it, according to the statement by FAS, written in Russian but translated via Google Translate.

Daniel Sparks (TMFDanielSparks) Mar 14, 2017 at 11:13PM Even tech stocks can sometimes be solid dividend stocks for income investors. And two of the best dividend stocks in the tech sector are undoubtedly Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). But which of these two dividend-paying tech juggernauts is the better bet for investors looking for income? Comparing these two dividend stocks is particularly timely, given that Apple stock has soared about 21% in the past three months while Microsoft has lagged with a 2.4% gain during the same period. After Apple's recent rise in its stock price, is Microsoft looking more attractive? MSFT data by YCharts Microsoft Company Dividend Yield Payout Ratio 3-Year Compound Average Dividend Growth Rate EPS Growth in Most Recent Quarter Microsoft 2.4% 69.5% 11.7%  6.6% Data source: Reuters. Table by author. Microsoft is a well-rounded dividend stock. With a dividend yield of 2.4%, the software giant easily beats Apple's 1.6% dividend yield. Going further, the yield is meaningfully higher than the 2% average dividend yield of stocks in the S&P 500. However, to achieve this dividend yield, Microsoft needs to pay out a higher portion of its earnings than Apple does. In the trailing 12 months, Microsoft has paid out 69.5% of its earnings in dividends. Notably, however, Microsoft's dividend payments as a percentage of its free cash flow are just 42%. Paying out only 42% of its annual free cash flow in dividends, Microsoft's dividend is easily sustainable. Another area where Microsoft shines as a dividend stock is in the company's underlying earnings growth. Microsoft has recently witnessed a strong return to earnings growth, with EPS up 6.6% in the company's most recent quarter. This earnings growth should help Microsoft maintain its 11.7% average annual dividend increase of the past three years. Apple Company Dividend Yield Payout Ratio 3-Year Compound Average Dividend Growth Rate EPS Growth in Most Recent Quarter Apple 1.6% 27% 9% 2.3% Data source: Reuters. Table by author. Apple's weaknesses as a dividend stock compared with Microsoft are immediately apparent. Its 1.6% dividend yield is well below Microsoft's and even below the average 2% dividend yield of stocks in the S&P 500. Further, Apple's earnings growth recently is paltry. In the company's most recent quarter, EPS rose just 2.3% year over year. But Apple stands out when it comes to its payout ratio. With a payout ratio of just 27%, Apple has substantial room for further dividend increases in the future. And Apple's dividend payments as a percentage of its free cash flow are even lower, at just 23%. Image source: Getty Images. So while Apple's three-year average annualized dividend growth of 9% is lower than Microsoft's 11.7% average annualized growth during the same period, Apple's dividend looks as if it will probably grow faster in the coming years. Overall, it seems that Apple's rising stock price recently has suppressed the company's dividend yield to a low enough level to make Microsoft look like the better dividend stock today -- a different conclusion from in my November 2015 comparison, when Apple's dividend yield was higher and its payout ratio was even lower. However, while Microsoft may be the better dividend stock today, Apple still looks like an attractive bet for income investors thanks to the growth potential evident from the company's very low payout ratio.  Teresa Kersten is an employee of LinkedIn and is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Digital Trends Home > Mobile > These are the best iOS 11 concept designs so far These are the best iOS 11 concept designs so far By Christian de Looper — March 11, 2017 3:00 AM Subscribe Share Sam Beckett Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends The next iPhone is well on its way, and we’ve heard a ton of rumors about what the new phone (or phones) might look like. With any new smartphone, however, there’s sure to be a new operating system to go along with it. For the next iPhone, that means iOS 11. Although we’ll probably start hearing details regarding the mobile OS soon, creative minds are already at work creating concepts of what they want the operating system to look like. These aren’t based on any facts, but rather things the creators want to see in iOS 11. That said, here are some of our favorite iOS 11 concept designs so far. iOS 11 Concept From Jacek Zieba This is perhaps one of the newest concepts, and the best thing about it is that we can totally see it coming to fruition. The ideas in the video show some small and very reasonable tweaks to iOS 11 that would make things a lot easier in a number of different situations. For example, the video shows a beautiful and classic-looking Dark Mode, a feature that has long been requested by iOS users. The video also shows a slew of great features, including the ability to set up multiple accounts on a single iPad, a button for locking the screen orientation, and a split-screen mode for the iPhone. The latter would allow users to engage in a variety of activities simultaneously, meaning you could essentially watch a video while surfing the web. All these changes are well-designed and look very Apple-esque, so perhaps Apple will take note and implement some of them in future iOS builds. CirqleUI While this concept is a little less believable than the previous one, it still draws inspiration from Apple’s software. Only, that inspiration comes from the Apple Watch’s WatchOS, rather than iOS. As you can see in the video, the home screen seems to use a clock with circular icons surrounding it, which is very similar to the main screen on the Apple Watch. Even the quick settings menu is a little more circular — it boasts a rounded border rather than the straight interface normally found on the iPhone. The concept even incorporates the Watch’s Digital Touch feature, which allows users to send little sketches and taps to other users. ComConceptsiPhone iPhone 8 Concept This concept isn’t limited to software, as it also shows a concept for the iPhone 8’s hardware. In the video above, the iPhone does away with the long-used Home button in favor of a larger display. The fingerprint sensor is built directly into the display and shows up in the bottom-left of the screen. The operating system is even given classy notifications, as well as a new control center, which looks sleeker than iOS’ current one. Aside from the aforementioned hardware changes, this iOS concept shows some basic refinements that we could see Apple actually making in the future. There’s certainly no guarantee, but the changes look very Apple-esque and modern. AGVideos iOS 11 Concept This concept also deviates from the current iPhone hardware, but it’s interesting because of how it incorporates the Touch Bar on the new MacBook Pro. Like the previous concept, you can see that the device has a full-screen display that does away with the Home button. Instead, it features a dedicated software button along with an iPhone-optimized Touch Bar. That Touch Bar is mainly used for switching between apps quickly and efficiently. The concept also shows a split-screen mode for the iPhone, a feature that has so far been limited to the iPad. Last but not least, it shows an “AirDrop 2.0,” which apparently allows users to share files by simply pushing on them with 3D Touch. iOS 11 Concept — iPhone Lover The fifth and final concept in our roundup also shows some basic UI tweaks that Apple could very easily implement in iOS 11. For example, the control center has been given 3D Touch controls, so if you hard press on the Wi-Fi button, you’ll have the ability to turn Wi-Fi on or quick select certain Wi-Fi networks. The concept also shows a handsome Dark Mode, which gives everything a subtle tint.
