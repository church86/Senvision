While Apple's recently announced Clips app is mainly focussed on easing up the process of video creation and sharing on social media, the search giant's upcoming app will reportedly make use of image recognition, allow users to apply filters, and even allow users to add tags to the pictures in groups. Google has confirmed to TechCrunch about the existence of the app but has termed it as one of the several experiments that the company is currently running. The California-based company is trying not to just create "yet another messaging app" but rather provide a collaborative experience to users while editing photos after sharing it with small group of friends, as per the report by TechCrunch. Even though many details about the app, including release timeline or its name, are currently not available, Google will reportedly be making use of its expertise in computer vision in the app to tag the objects in photos and organise them in order to find them with ease later on. The app is also said to allow users to apply filter to the images, a feature made popular by Snapchat but has been adopted by every social media platform now. One of the people familiar with the matter told TechCrunch that the new app from Google will be a competitor to Path, a social media app that allows users to share and edit photos and videos with friends. The initial plans to announce the app were said to be for Google I/O in May but after the announcement of Clips by Apple these seem to have been changed, TechCrunch notes.

_ Macworld Australia MAC iPad iPhone iSnap App Guide Gadget Guide mResell HOME NEWS FEATURES REVIEWS HELP/TIPS BLOGS Mac In Business Communications Productivity Security Workflow FORUM MAGAZINE Digital Subscription Current Issue Back Issues Apple’s acquisition of Workflow could bring automation to iOS Dan Moren 27 March, 2017 View more articles fromthe author AAA Comments News After this week’s news that Apple had acquired the iOS power user app Workflow, you’d be excused for being a bit confused about the future of automation on Apple’s platform. After all, it was just last November that Sal Soghoian, Apple’s product manager of automation technologies, left the company when his position was eliminated. And yet, Apple snapped up Workflow, an app that many had compared to Apple’s own Automator, which was introduced way back in 2005’s Mac OS X Tiger. So what gives? Is there still some life in automation and scripting features on Apple’s platforms, or is this merely a case of Apple acquiring useful talent? Follow the script Scripting’s been part of the Mac since the earliest days. AppleScript, which grew out of HyperCard’s HyperTalk scripting language, was built into System 7 back in 1993. It was a way to automate complex tasks across multiple applications, and it had a lot of power thanks not only to its deep integration into the OS, but also to third-party developers who made their apps addressable by the scripting language. But for all its power, AppleScript has always been a bit esoteric. While it was intended to be accessible and used a sort of natural English syntax, it was often still too complex for the average user. On the other end, those used to more traditional programming languages found its idiosyncrasies equally baffling. When AppleScript found its way into OS X – if anecdotal accounts are to be believed, almost entirely thanks to the willpower of Soghoian – it laid the groundwork for Automator, a graphical and more user-friendly attempt to handle the kind of tasks AppleScript had. But Automator never quite managed to live up to its potential. In many cases, one had to fall back on AppleScript or UNIX shell scripts to accomplish some functions, and its graphical interface still wasn’t enough make it friendly to most mainstream users. But as computers became more mature and powerful, there wasn’t always the same need for automation and scripting as there had been back in the early days when many users needed to also be part programmer to get things done. Many tasks that had once been automated could now be handled by applications created by Apple or third parties. Though both AppleScript and Automation stuck around in subsequent releases of OS X, neither got any real attention from Apple. Workflow on iOS A few years after Automation’s introduction, the iPhone showed up with no automation capabilities whatsoever. Though many parts of OS X made the jump to the platform, AppleScript and Automator were left behind. Almost 10 years later, that situation hasn’t changed. It was just in 2014 that apps even got the ability to communicate with one another. Enter Workflow, an app that is, on the surface, very similar to Automator, providing a graphical interface with which to automate complex tasks across apps and services. But the kicker is that it pulled all this functionality off without Apple’s help. While some have embraced Workflow’s power, it’s suffered from the same challenges that Automator has encountered on the Mac. Most users either don’t have or haven’t identified a need for automation, and for the fraction that have, only another fraction go through the trouble of finding and learning to use a tool like Workflow. Will the future be automated? All of these factors make Apple’s acquisition of Workflow even more puzzling. The easy answer, of course, is that Apple was impressed with the resourcefulness of the development team and wanted to hire them. In the long term, that will probably mean shutting down Workflow. I’m not convinced, though, in part because Workflow provides useful features that aren’t available anywhere else. (And Apple’s first move was to make the app free, which could be a sign they plan to keep it around.) That could be a compelling enough argument for Apple to make use of the app’s capabilities itself. Why reinvent the wheel if the company is interested in bringing automation to iOS? And, frankly, it should be. Even with the addition of app extensions in iOS 8, inter-app communication has remained a weak point. Why not bring Workflow to the Mac? Well maybe because at its more mature age, it isn’t crying out for automation in the same way. AppleScript and Automator are still there, after all, and while they might not get more useful as time goes by, neither has their functionality been snatched away. But let’s face it: iOS and the iPhone are the most prominent part of Apple’s identity these days, and what happens there sets the tone for the company. It’s a no-brainer that the company wants its products to get more powerful and useful, and Workflow’s capabilities might be one way to do that.

_ Macworld Australia MAC iPad iPhone iSnap App Guide Gadget Guide mResell HOME NEWS FEATURES REVIEWS HELP/TIPS BLOGS Mac In Business Communications Productivity Security Workflow FORUM MAGAZINE Digital Subscription Current Issue Back Issues A look at new features in iTunes 12.6 Kirk McElhearn 27 March, 2017 View more articles fromthe author AAA Comments Help Apple recently released iTunes 12.6, and it addresses some issues that readers have been writing me about for some time. In this week’s column, I answer a couple of those questions and explain some of the changes in iTunes 12.6. Apple has – finally – brought back the ability to open playlists in their own windows. And the MiniPlayer, that small floating window that lets you control iTunes, has been updated. Read on to find out what’s new in iTunes 12.6. Playlist windows Q: I remember that, some time ago, I could open playlists in iTunes in their own windows. Will Apple ever bring that feature back? I get this question often, and just this week, when Apple updated iTunes to version 12.6, I was surprised to discover that this ability had been restored. Back in 2015, on my website, I wrote a series of articles about how I would fix iTunes, and part 3 was about multiple windows. I asked for both playlist windows and for the ability – long available in iTunes – to open the iTunes Store in its own window. You can open a playlist in iTunes 12.6 in a window in two ways. The first is to right-click on a playlist and choose Open Playlist in New Window. The second is to press the Command key and double-click on a playlist. This is useful when you are working on a playlist and want to add songs from your library. You can have two windows open, and drag songs from your library to the playlist more easily. Or you can have multiple playlist windows open, to add songs to various playlists, or move them among existing playlists. There are some limitations to this, however. These playlist windows don’t show in iTunes’ Window menu, so there’s no easy way to switch to and from these windows when they’re hidden behind the main iTunes window. But you can cycle through the windows by pressing Command-~, so if you only have a few open, you can switch among them easily. While Apple followed part of my suggestion about multiple windows, they did not, however, restore the ability to open the iTunes Store in its own window. For now, you can only view the Store in the main iTunes window. The new MiniPlayer Q: I’m used to using the MiniPlayer to control my listening with iTunes. But I updated to the latest version of iTunes, and it’s very different. I no longer see an artwork thumbnail, and it’s much larger than before. What’s up with that? iTunes 12.6 features a totally revamped MiniPlayer. You activate this by choosing Window > MiniPlayer. Here’s what it looks like: By default, the previous MiniPlayer displayed without artwork visible, but with a small thumbnail at the left of the window. Now, the first time you invoke the MiniPlayer, you see artwork. You can change this by hovering your cursor over the MiniPlayer window, which displays controls in the place of the track name, artist name, and album above, then clicking the … button and choosing Hide MiniPlayer Large Artwork. You can also drag the window up from the bottom until the artwork disappears. Click the Up Next button at the right of the control section of the window to display your Up Next queue, and have access to your listening history, and to lyrics, if they are available. This isn’t new, but the display is much cleaner. (Note: the Clear button that used to be at the top of the list is now at the bottom.) Try resizing the window in different directions. If you resize it enough vertically, then move your cursor away, the controls disappear, and just artwork displays. Keep dragging up and the artwork disappears, and you get that simple controller. And you can drag to the right or left to expand the window (and then contract it going in the other direction).

Carolina Milanesi, an analyst at Creative Strategies Inc, likened it to hotel rooms offering iPhone docking stations.  Marriott is testing the Amazon-based Echo (right) and Apple's Siri (left) in some of its rooms Marriott International Inc is testing the Amazon-based Echo and Apple's Siri in its Aloft hotel in Boston to determine which is best for hotel guests to control the lights, temperature drapes and TV, Bloomberg reports.  Marriott's Toni Stoeckl wants Aloft to act as a 'tech incubator' for new ideas that can be implemented in the company's other chains.  In December, the hotel giant's Wynn Las Vegas property was the first to install the Alexa-powered Echo device, with plans to equip all 4,748 rooms with the product by this summer.  The JW Marriott San Antonio Hill Country Resort and Spa in Texas has installed Alexa-powered devices in 10 of its rooms, with plans to equip 100 more rooms by the end of March.

'The race is still on.'  Marriott's looking at how Alexa performs as a concierge for ordering room service and requesting housekeeping.   It's unknown whether a hotel guest will be allowed to access the voice-controlled device using their own account or if more standard commands will be in place.  'It will be interesting to see how much education they have to go through to get guests to use them,' said Milanesi.

WikiLeaks tweeted claims the hacking tools will not work on newer Apple products are false. Earlier, WikiLeaks called Apple’s statement “duplicitous.” Read: CIA Hacking Tools For Macs, iPhones Revealed WikiLeaks has been slowly releasing the CIA hacking tools, created to spy on people through smart televisions, smartphones and other household technological devices. The leaked documents explain how the spy agency allegedly used malware and physical hacking. The CIA has not commented on the authenticity of the documents but has said it does not target individuals in the United States. Read: Edward Snowden Calls CIA Documents 'Authentic' Apple said last week the iPhone and Mac vulnerabilities outlined in the #Vault7 dump were fixed years ago and applied only to the iPhone 3G, which was introduced in 2008, and iPhone3GS. Apple also said the Mac vulnerabilities were fixed in devices manufactured after 2013. “We have not negotiated with WikiLeaks for any information,” Apple said in a statement. “We have given them instructions to submit any information they wish through our normal process under our standard terms. Thus far, we have not received any information from them that isn’t in the public domain.” WikiLeaks said it was “likely” the CIA got hold of Apple products during shipping to infect them. Newer Apple phones, however, have digital security certificates that cannot be overwritten so if a phone had been infected, a flag would be raised during setup if the certificates didn’t match, Newsfactor noted. WikiLeaks reportedly has yet to share with Google, Microsoft, Apple and other tech companies details of the hacking tools the CIA used against them. The Collective Evolution reported that though WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange announced WikiLeaks would partner with the tech companies to patch the zero-day exploits, no relevant data has been turned over. “It is CIA’s job to be innovative, cutting-edge, and the first line of defense in protecting this country from enemies abroad,” the CIA said in a statement earlier this month. “America deserves nothing less.” Related Articles Silicon Valley Questions WikiLeaks Founder’s Russia Ties CIA's Hacking Team Working To Exploit iOS And Android Devices, Says WikiLeaks Reblog Share Tweet Share What to Read Next NASA just captured a photo of Jupiter that you won’t believe is real BGR News Did an astroid strike a Martian ocean and create a cataclysmic tsunami?

The next generation of MacBooks could come in the form of aluminum shells that are hardware “hosts” for iPhones and iPads, according to a newly public patent application that provides a rare glimpse into Apple’s carefully guarded vision for laptops. Apple envisions two notebook designs, one that would use an iPad as its screen, and another that would feature a compartment to house an iPhone in the spot usually reserved for a trackpad. These crossbreed devices are each called a “cooperative electronic assembly” in the patent application filed last year and made public Thursday. For anyone familiar with a device called the Motorola Atrix Laptop, which had a dock for a smartphone in its rear, this is yet another example of what’s-old-is-new-again. You’re probably thinking that this is classic Apple: Take a half-baked idea from a competitor, make it pretty, perfect the technology and tell the masses that such a divine creation could only have come from the hallowed halls of Steve Jobs. But this gets even less innovative: Samsung also applied for a patent for a laptop that doubled as a phablet dock in 2015. However, both the failed Motorola laptop and the Samsung hybrid-that-never-was had a shared disadvantage: They were ugly. I’d bet that if Apple ever prototypes this device, that’s one thing you won’t be able to criticize it for. Just because Apple applied for a patent doesn’t mean that device will become reality. More often than not, tech hardware patents are akin to covering your bases. Even making a prototype of the laptop is a far cry from bringing it to market. And Apple is infamous for abandoned projects, big and small. But there’s something about this proposed hardware that rings true. Not only is Apple searching for a way to justify its bad decision to ignore touchscreen laptops, it’s also searching for ways to more tightly integrate its ecosystem. This interdependent device is about as integrated as it gets since the application specifically calls for neither component to work very well without the other. “It is contemplated that the electronic accessory device is inoperable without the electronic host device,” the patent application reads. The hybrid computer is also in line with the trajectory of the so-called Internet of Things, the idea that everything that can be connected will be connected. It’s possible that what we think of today as a powerful electronic aspect of our lives — cars, laptops, even houses — will be seen more like containers for software and hardware components in the future, just as Apple’s proposed laptop would be. The smartphone/laptop hybrid could be a significant play for enterprise-level users who give presentations for a living. Demos, clicker-style PowerPoints and remote meetings need a better hardware solution. The patent application also makes clear that the iPhone-powered laptop could treat the smartphone as a sensor, which could make way for interesting medical uses as consumers seek more data on their health. So, while this might not be the most mind-blowing innovation, Apple’s laptop hybrid may be right on time.

While Apple has flatly denied the claims recently, saying such scheme is impossible, it’s still a good idea to check your Apple ID and iCloud account today and make sure it’s protected. Here’s how you can secure yours from any iCloud hacker: Change Your Password The first step you can take is to change your Apple ID password. Even if you think you haven’t been hacked, it’s better to be safe than sorry. Business Insider urges every Apple user not to use the same password across different services to lower the chances of being hacked. Also, avoid making short and predictable passwords. Make them random and unique instead. Enable Two-Factor Authentication Enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) can also secure your account from Apple iCloud hacking. Turning on such features give you an extra layer of security. It means that whenever you log into your account from a new device, you will have to provide two types of information: your password and a special code which is sent to one of your other Apple devices. The second one is a sex-digit code that can either be texted to you or be automatically displayed in a pop-up window. Apple iCloud Hacking: Enabling Two-Factor Authentication is annoying, but it’s the best way to ensure that your account remains your own. After you sign in, you won’t get a code again unless you sign out, erase the device or change your password. The 2FA feature requires a device that uses iOS 9 or OS X El Capitan. To set it up, follow the steps below: On your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch with iOS 9 or later: Go to Settings > iCloud > Apple ID. Tap Password & Security. Enable ‘Turn on Two-Factor Authentication’. On your Mac with OS X El Capitan or later: Go to Apple (?) menu > System Preferences > iCloud > Account Details. Tap Security. Enable ‘Turn on Two-Factor Authentication’. Remove All Personal Data According to Tom’s Guide, you can also remove all your personal data and photos from iCloud and store them somewhere else. Google Photos, for example, is available for iOS and also automatically backs up and labels your photos as you take them. But the site cautions that even alternative file storage services like Google’s are being targeted by other hackers too. So it’s still more advisable to just make your iCloud account secure than to migrate all your data to other services that aren’t as secure.

Tech News | 20 Mar 2017 | Print  | Comment (15) 30 Conferences for Mac and iOS Professionals in 2017 by Adam C. Engst and Josh Centers Despite the loss of Macworld/iWorld, which many in the industry continue to mourn, there’s no shortage of Apple-focused conferences for professionals to gather with peers. We have once again collected details — or at least dates — for all the Apple-related conferences we can find; if we’ve missed any, let us know in the comments. We’ve sorted them by date so you can scroll through and see which might fit into your schedule. If you want to meet part of the TidBITS gang, Adam Engst will be at the ACEs Conference in May, and he and Tonya are likely to go to MacTech Conference in November. Josh Centers is planning to attend the iBooks Author Conference in October. If regular TidBITS contributors are asked to speak at any others, we’ll be sure to mention that in a future article.

WWDC: June 5–9, 2017 -- Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference will take place at the McEnery Convention Center in San Jose, CA June 5th through 9th (see “WWDC 2017 Moves Back to San Jose on June 5th through 9th,” 16 February 2017). Registration opened 27 March 2017 at 10:00 AM PDT. As in previous years, tickets will be distributed by lottery to registered developers who wish to attend. Tickets cost $1599, but Apple offers scholarships for students that include lodging. A number of other events will be taking place alongside WWDC. Jim Dalrymple’s Beard Bash will offer free music and beer on 5 June 2017 at the City National Civic. John Gruber will be hosting a live recording of his podcast, The Talk Show, on 6 June 2017 at the California Theater. James Dempsey and the Breakpoints will be performing the night of 7 June 2017 at the City National Civic, with proceeds to benefit App Camp for Girls. If you can’t score a WWDC ticket, there are three adjoining conferences: AltConf, CocoaConf Next Door, and Layers.287.9925 AltConf: June 5-8 2017 -- AltConf is a free, community-driven event that takes place alongside WWDC, offering additional talks and events for those who weren’t lucky enough to get into WWDC or who want a break from the Apple Reality Distortion Field. While tickets are free, you can buy a “hero ticket” for $300 that guarantees entry. CocoaConf Next Door: June 5-8 2017 -- Taking place alongside WWDC — literally next door — CocoaConf Next Door is a four-day developer conference covering all things Swift, iOS and macOS. Early bird registration is $999 until 28 April 2017, when the full schedule is expected to be announced. Confirmed speakers are Jean MacDonald of App Camp for Girls, author Daniel Steinberg, author Rob Napier, and Khan Academy developer Laura Savino. Layers: June 5-7 2017 -- A conference for designers, Layers is described as “like a party, but for learning.” This three-day conference will take place at the Montgomery Theater, across from WWDC. Details have yet to be announced, but tickets cost $850 each. MacDeployment: June 8–9 2017 -- A two-day conference starting on June 8th at the University of Calgary in Canada, MacDeployment is dedicated to the best practices in Mac deployment and maintenance. Registration will open in April. X World: June 29–30, 2017 -- For those who manage Mac and iOS installations in a support, lab manager, network technician, or systems administrator role, the Australian Apple University Consortium puts on the X World conference.

Registration includes workshops, breakout sessions, networking events, and breakfast, lunch, and dinner throughout the event. Rooms at recommended hotels can be found for around $100 per night Macstock Conference & Expo: July 15–16, 2017 -- Returning for its third year, Macstock 2017 will be held July 15th and 16th at the Luecht Conference Center in Crystal Lake, IL. The $199 premium ticket admission to all speaker and roundtable sessions, lunch, dinner, breakfast, a T-shirt, the new Macstock Swap Trading Zone, admission to Barry’s Midwest Mac Mingle After Party, and a complimentary pint glass. If you don’t want to go to the after-party or need a pint glass, you can get a $169 standard ticket, and if you have only one day to attend, an $89 single-day ticket gives you a choice Saturday or Sunday. Speakers will include Chuck Joiner of MacVoices, developer Brett Terpstra, and Allison Sheridan of Nosillacast, among a variety of other well-known members of the Apple media and user group world. Refreshingly, Macstock is aimed at Apple enthusiasts of all experience levels, making it one of the few conferences that’s open to the everyday Apple user who just wants to learn more and hobnob with like-minded people. Sessions are identified as being appropriate for beginners or intermediate users. FileMaker Developer Conference: July 24–27, 2017 -- This one’s pretty specific, but since the FileMaker Developer Conference is open to the public and FileMaker is an Apple subsidiary, we’re including it. It takes place from July 24th through 27th at the JW Marriott Phoenix Desert Ridge in Phoenix. Early bird registration is $999 until 28 April 2017 after which it goes up by $100.

Reply Henry Larsen  2017-03-20 23:41 Sorry, but in this article you guys repeatedly set off a loud annoyance buzzer for me and, I expect, more than a few others. What's the problem? Well, here are a few examples: Mdevcon: ... Amsterdam, Netherlands IOSCon: ... London, England Don't all educated people (such as those who might be interested in attending a tech conference) know where Amsterdam is?!? (And it's 'the Netherlands' by the way.) If you mean Amsterdam, New York, then, OK, specify that. Otherwise the city name suffices. Likewise London. CocoaConf: ... Chicago, IL Is there even another Chicago, anywhere? App Builders Switzerland: ... Zürich, Switzerland Gosh, do you really think your readers are so stupid that they might think the App Builders _Switzerland_ conference is possibly in Zürich, Alabama? &c., &c., &c. Now, I understand that most of your readers are American and many observers have noted that Americans may be more geographically challenged than others -- but that's no reason to pander to them. Reply Adam Engst   2017-03-21 09:06 From a publishing standpoint, we juggle completeness versus brevity all the time. For this article, we chose to be complete in terms of providing U.S. states or countries with the city name in most cases. I honestly wasn't paying that much attention to the place names this time around in favor of focusing on the dates and other details. Now that you point it out, it does look a little awkward, so I'll go through and trim out the obvious ones. I somehow doubt that most people know where Crystal Lake and State College are, so I'll leave those. Reply Richard Smith  2017-03-21 18:08 On that note, a consistency issue, you have the list mostly sorted by date, so I'm wondering why MacAdmins: July 11–14, 2017, is listed above X World: June 29–30, 2017.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Security Despite Apple denial, hackers prove stolen iCloud data is real Chris Smith @chris_writes March 24th, 2017 at 10:33 AM Share Tweet Apple confirmed on Thursday that its servers were not hacked, after reports earlier this week claimed that hackers are holding hundreds of millions of accounts for ransom. Even though Apple said it did not suffer a data breach, and that it’s monitoring the situation, the publicity-hungry Turkish Crime Family (TCF) hackers still have an April 7th deadline in mind. At that point, they say they will remotely wipe hundreds of millions of iPhones that are tied to the Apple ID databases they have obtained. While it all sounds pretty questionable, a new report indicates that the hackers may indeed be sitting on a huge cache of genuine Apple ID accounts, complete with passwords. Don't Miss: Netflix has 25 new originals set for release in April – here’s the full list The hackers gave ZDNet a sample of 54 sets of credentials, and the tech blog discovered that the accounts were indeed valid. ZDNet contacted the users, who appear to all be UK-based, and verified the passwords. Of the 54 accounts, only 10 were still in use. The people were using different cellular networks, and they owned different devices, including iPhone, iPad, and Macs. These details seem to indicate that the data doesn’t originate from one specific carrier, and that no single Apple product line has somehow been compromised. Most of the account owners in this case say that they have had the same passwords on iCloud for four or five years, and they also use the same email address and password combinations on other sites. Three people said the iCloud email and password were unique to iCloud, which is a puzzling detail for this investigation since Apple denies that its servers were breached. ZDNet believes that the data may come from breaches that occurred between 2011 and 2015. The overall implications of these findings are clear: the threats are not empty. All users should go ahead and change their iCloud password right now, and it never hurts to enable 2-factor authentication as well. Also, users should make sure they don’t use the same user name and password combination anywhere else, no matter how convenient it might be.

British press reports suggest Masood used the messaging service owned by Facebook just minutes before starting a rampage Wednesday that left three pedestrians and one police officer dead and dozens more wounded, including some with catastrophic injuries. ADVERTISEMENT Home Secretary Amber Rudd used appearances on BBC and Sky News to urge WhatsApp and other encrypted services to make their platforms accessible to intelligence services and police trying to carrying out lawful eavesdropping. "We need to make sure that organizations like WhatsApp — and there are plenty of others like that — don't provide a secret place for terrorists to communicate with each other," she said. Rudd did not provide any details about Masood's use of WhatsApp, saying only "this terrorist sent a WhatsApp message and it can't be accessed." But her call for a "back door" system to allow authorities to retrieve information is likely to meet resistance from the tech industry, which has faced previous law enforcement demands for access to data after major attacks. In the United States, Apple fought the FBI's request for the passcodes needed to unlock an iPhone that had been used by one of the perpetrators in the 2015 extremist attack in San Bernardino, California. The FBI initially claimed it could obtain the data only with Apple's help, but ultimately found another way to hack into the locked phone. Masood drove a rented SUV into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge before smashing it into Parliament's gates and rushing onto the grounds, where he stabbed a policeman to death before he was shot dead. A detailed police reconstruction has found the entire attack lasted 82 seconds. Police are trying to pinpoint his motive and identify any possible accomplices, making the WhatsApp message a potential clue to his state of mind and his social media contacts. Rudd said attacks like Masood's would be easier to prevent if authorities could penetrate encrypted services after obtaining warrants similar to the ones used to listen in on telephone calls or — in snail mail days — to steam open letters and read their contents. Without a change in the system, she said terrorists would be able to communicate with each other without fear of being overheard even in cases where a legal warrant has been obtained. Rudd also urged technology companies to do a better job at preventing the publication of material that promotes extremism. She plans to meet with firms Thursday about setting up an industry board that would take steps to make the web less useful to extremists. British police investigating the attack say they still believe Masood, a 52-year-old Briton, acted alone and say they have no indications that further attacks are planned. Metropolitan Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu said it may never be possible to fully determine Masood's motives. "That understanding may have died with him," Basu said Saturday night as police appealed for people who knew Masood or saw him to contact investigators. "Even if he acted alone in the preparation, we need to establish with absolute clarity why he did these unspeakable acts, to bring reassurance to Londoners." The Islamic State group, which is losing territory in Iraq and Syria but still has radical followers in other parts of the world, has claimed Masood was a "soldier" carrying out its wishes to attack Western countries. Masood had convictions for violent crimes in the U.K. and spent time in prison. He also worked in Saudi Arabia teaching English for two years and traveled there again in 2015 on a visa designed for religious pilgrimages. One 58-year-old man remains in custody in the case after being arrested in Birmingham, where Masood had been living. He has not been charged or named. Nine others arrested after the assault have been freed without charges and one has been freed on bail. The family of slain police officer Keith Palmer, meanwhile, released a statement thanking those who tried to save his life. "There was nothing more you could have done. You did your best and we are just grateful he was not alone," the statement said. <a href='http://ads.independent.com.mt/www/delivery/ck.php?n=a4a2316f&amp;cb=123' target='_blank'><img data-src='http://ads.independent.com.mt/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=35&amp;cb=123&amp;n=a4a2316f' border='0' alt='' /></a> <a href='http://ads.independent.com.mt/www/delivery/ck.php?n=a04fc846&amp;cb=289' target='_blank'><img data-src='http://ads.independent.com.mt/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=140&amp;cb=289&amp;n=a04fc846' border='0' alt='' /></a> don't miss <a href='http://ads.independent.com.mt/www/delivery/ck.php?n=a77228e5&amp;cb=24' target='_blank'><img data-src='http://ads.independent.com.mt/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=34&amp;cb=24&amp;n=a77228e5' border='0' alt='' /></a> World News Icelandic hospital delivers record… Complaints as UK's Daily Mail focuses… UK attacker's wife 'saddened and… World news in one minute: Find out what… Man kills three burglars who entered… American Airlines buys stake in China… Updated: Poland questions legality of… Updated: British, Scottish leaders to… open Terms of Use Advertising Rates Contact Us Designed and developed by Deloitte Digital Independent Online. ©2017.

The Cupertino-based company has long been trying to woo one of the world’s largest smartphone markets with mixed results. While iPhones are indeed popular in China, Apple has been experiencing rather strong opposition not just from rivals but also from government agencies and patent holding entities. At least Apple has gotten a slight reprieve now that the Beijing Intellectual Property Court has overturned a previous ruling that found Apple guilty of copying a design patent for the iPhone 6. Last year, the Beijing Intellectual Property Office sided with plaintiff Shenzen Baili who sued Apple back in 2014 for patent infringement. It claimed that the iPhone 6’s new design infringes on the design of its own 100C smartphone with its rounded corners and curved edges. Apple would have been forced to immediately halt sales of the iPhone 6 and later models in China, had it not been granted a stay on the injunction pending an appeal. Fortunately for Apple, the law has sided with it in this case. The Beijing IP court determined that the iPhone had enough features to distinguish it from the 100C and that consumers won’t be so easily fooled by superficial similarities. It also said that there was no legal basis for the claim in the first place. The ruling could deal a fatal blow to Shenzen Baili and parent company Digione, which are barely existing as skeleton companies anyway. There has been some doubt about the credibility of the company suing Apple and it might have just used up its last legal recourse and hope for financial salvation. While a significant victory for Apple, it is far from being safe in China. It has still been found guilty in other cases, including a patent infringement on Siri and even the iPhone trademark. There’s also the never-ending censorship issues. With rising competition from Chinese OEMs, Apple definitely still has a lot of work, especially legal ones, to do.

A statement issued by the Beijing Intellectual Property Court on Friday said that Apple did not violate design patents of its rival firm Shenzhen Baili. Last May, Shenzhen Baili sued the Chinese subsidiary of Apple and the local sales firm Zoomflight, associated with the multinational Cupertino, claiming that the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus phones had similarities with its smartphone model 100c, leading to a decision from the Beijing Intellectual Property Office to ban sales of the models. Apple and Zoomflight appealed the decision in court, which on Friday ruled in their favor, citing insufficient evidence to justify the sales ban. However, the court rejected Apples demand that Shenzhen Baili lose the patent rights to its 100c model. Apple is one of the leaders in the competitive Chinese telecommunications market, although for years it has faced several intellectual property problems in the courts both as plaintiff and defendant. Currently, the company has also lost some market share in China, with local brands such as Oppo, Huawei and Vivo exceeding sales in China last year.   Enter your email address to subscribe to free headlines (and great cartoons so every email has a happy ending!) from the Latin American Herald Tribune:   RSS Feed [ Home ] [ About Us ] [ Who's Who ] [ Contacts ] [ Help ] Copyright Latin American Herald Tribune - 2005-2015 © All rights reserved

Tech News | 20 Mar 2017 | Print  | Comment (15) 30 Conferences for Mac and iOS Professionals in 2017 by Adam C. Engst and Josh Centers Despite the loss of Macworld/iWorld, which many in the industry continue to mourn, there’s no shortage of Apple-focused conferences for professionals to gather with peers. We have once again collected details — or at least dates — for all the Apple-related conferences we can find; if we’ve missed any, let us know in the comments. We’ve sorted them by date so you can scroll through and see which might fit into your schedule. If you want to meet part of the TidBITS gang, Adam Engst will be at the ACEs Conference in May, and he and Tonya are likely to go to MacTech Conference in November. Josh Centers is planning to attend the iBooks Author Conference in October. If regular TidBITS contributors are asked to speak at any others, we’ll be sure to mention that in a future article. MacTech Pro: March–September 2017 -- A regional event series from the folks behind MacTech Conference, MacTech Pro is designed for professional Apple techs and consultants. Events are single-track, hotel-based seminars, and the all-day schedule includes lunch. Topics will include creating a storage strategy, deployment methods, scripting Python, IoT and home automation, security, troubleshooting, and more. Early bird pricing is $299, with pre-registration pricing at $399, and regular pricing at $499. Educational and non-profit pricing is $199. The March 15th event in Seattle, WA has already passed, but the remaining MacTech Pro events will take place in eight cities throughout the United States: April 5 in Boston, MA May 3 in Atlanta, GA May 24 in Washington, D.C.

Úll: April 10–11, 2017 -- The two-day Úll conference takes place in Killarney, Ireland at The Europe hotel and resort. Úll is designed for “people who build and love great products… presented through an Apple-shaped lens.” Frankly, it sounds like big fun. The speakers this year include refreshingly new faces; we encourage you to read their bios. Headline speakers include Christina Warren of Gizmodo, Horace Dediu of Asymco, and Jason Snell of Six Colors. Tickets cost €799 (US$855) without accommodations or €1149 (US$1230) with two nights at The Europe hotel. CocoaConf: April 21–22, 2017 -- Focusing on training for iOS and Mac developers, CocoaConf will be providing three tracks and over 30 breakout and general sessions for its April session in Chicago. (CocoaConf also has a conference in Yosemite National Park on March 20th through 23rd, but tickets are sold out.) Speakers for the Chicago event include developers Chris Adamson, Jeff Biggus, Janie Clayton, James Dempsey, Laura Savino, and T.J. Usiyan. Registration for CocoaConf costs $650, or $850 if you want to attend a pre-conference workshop held the day before. The workshop is also available on its own for $350. App Builders Switzerland: April 24–25, 2017 -- Another conference for mobile app developers, App Builders Switzerland will take place in Zürich on April 24th and 25th.

Expect “all day presentations, demos, and workshops from the best damn iOS developers in Colorado.” UIKonf: May 14–17, 2017 -- Billed as “Berlin’s independent conference for serious iOS developers,” UIKonf is still lining up speakers but currently promises developer Cate Huston of Automatic, typographer and developer Frank Rausch, and author Rob Napier. Registration costs €529 (US$565) and includes free social events on the first day of the conference, but the organizers are encouraging charity donations for the social events. ACEs Conference: May 31–June 1, 2017 -- Organized by Apple consultant Justin Esgar, the Phoenix-based ACEs Conference is in its third year and promises to be “the place for inspiration, ideas, business networking, and instantly-applicable knowledge.” Focusing on ways that Apple consultants can grow their IT businesses, topics will include brand coaching, business workshops, and even meditation for dealing with high-stress situations the job entails. It’s scheduled for May 31st and June 1st at the Sheraton Grand Phoenix. This year’s keynote will be delivered by business author and entrepreneur Mike Michalowicz.

MacDevOps:YVR: June 5–6, 2017 -- MacDevOps:YVR will take place June 5th and 6th in Vancouver, Canada on the campus of Simon Fraser University. It focuses on open source projects built by members of the Mac enterprise community, such as Munki, created by Greg Neagle of Disney Animation and now the most popular app for distributing Mac software in the large organizations. If you code as part of managing Apple devices, check out this conference. Topics covered at MacDevOps:YVR include open source projects like Munki, Santa, osquery, Zentral, and more; code sharing with GitHub, GitLab, and other source control systems; security; the future of Apple IT; and the role of MDM for Macs in the future. Speakers include security researcher Sarah Lewis, Mike Lynn of Dropbox, and Joel Rennich of Trusource Labs Enterprise Services. For more details, listen to a podcast with Mat X, the conference organizer. Early bird registration costs CAD$265 (US$200) until 31 March 2017, after which it increases to CAD$465 (US$345). WWDC: June 5–9, 2017 -- Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference will take place at the McEnery Convention Center in San Jose, CA June 5th through 9th (see “WWDC 2017 Moves Back to San Jose on June 5th through 9th,” 16 February 2017). Registration opened 27 March 2017 at 10:00 AM PDT. As in previous years, tickets will be distributed by lottery to registered developers who wish to attend. Tickets cost $1599, but Apple offers scholarships for students that include lodging. A number of other events will be taking place alongside WWDC. Jim Dalrymple’s Beard Bash will offer free music and beer on 5 June 2017 at the City National Civic. John Gruber will be hosting a live recording of his podcast, The Talk Show, on 6 June 2017 at the California Theater. James Dempsey and the Breakpoints will be performing the night of 7 June 2017 at the City National Civic, with proceeds to benefit App Camp for Girls. If you can’t score a WWDC ticket, there are three adjoining conferences: AltConf, CocoaConf Next Door, and Layers.287.9925 AltConf: June 5-8 2017 -- AltConf is a free, community-driven event that takes place alongside WWDC, offering additional talks and events for those who weren’t lucky enough to get into WWDC or who want a break from the Apple Reality Distortion Field. While tickets are free, you can buy a “hero ticket” for $300 that guarantees entry. CocoaConf Next Door: June 5-8 2017 -- Taking place alongside WWDC — literally next door — CocoaConf Next Door is a four-day developer conference covering all things Swift, iOS and macOS. Early bird registration is $999 until 28 April 2017, when the full schedule is expected to be announced. Confirmed speakers are Jean MacDonald of App Camp for Girls, author Daniel Steinberg, author Rob Napier, and Khan Academy developer Laura Savino. Layers: June 5-7 2017 -- A conference for designers, Layers is described as “like a party, but for learning.” This three-day conference will take place at the Montgomery Theater, across from WWDC. Details have yet to be announced, but tickets cost $850 each. MacDeployment: June 8–9 2017 -- A two-day conference starting on June 8th at the University of Calgary in Canada, MacDeployment is dedicated to the best practices in Mac deployment and maintenance. Registration will open in April. X World: June 29–30, 2017 -- For those who manage Mac and iOS installations in a support, lab manager, network technician, or systems administrator role, the Australian Apple University Consortium puts on the X World conference. Session and registration information are not yet available, but the conference will take place at the University of Technology Sydney. MacAdmins: July 11–14, 2017 -- Hosted at the Penn Stater Conference Center Hotel in State College, PA, the MacAdmins conference offers over 50 technical sessions on Mac and iOS deployment plus networking opportunities for over 400 Apple-focused admins. Details about sessions and speakers for 2017 are not yet set, but registration opens 28 March 2017 and will cost $599 for early-bird registration, going up to $799 on 17 May 2017. Registration includes workshops, breakout sessions, networking events, and breakfast, lunch, and dinner throughout the event. Rooms at recommended hotels can be found for around $100 per night Macstock Conference & Expo: July 15–16, 2017 -- Returning for its third year, Macstock 2017 will be held July 15th and 16th at the Luecht Conference Center in Crystal Lake, IL. The $199 premium ticket admission to all speaker and roundtable sessions, lunch, dinner, breakfast, a T-shirt, the new Macstock Swap Trading Zone, admission to Barry’s Midwest Mac Mingle After Party, and a complimentary pint glass. If you don’t want to go to the after-party or need a pint glass, you can get a $169 standard ticket, and if you have only one day to attend, an $89 single-day ticket gives you a choice Saturday or Sunday. Speakers will include Chuck Joiner of MacVoices, developer Brett Terpstra, and Allison Sheridan of Nosillacast, among a variety of other well-known members of the Apple media and user group world. Refreshingly, Macstock is aimed at Apple enthusiasts of all experience levels, making it one of the few conferences that’s open to the everyday Apple user who just wants to learn more and hobnob with like-minded people. Sessions are identified as being appropriate for beginners or intermediate users. FileMaker Developer Conference: July 24–27, 2017 -- This one’s pretty specific, but since the FileMaker Developer Conference is open to the public and FileMaker is an Apple subsidiary, we’re including it. It takes place from July 24th through 27th at the JW Marriott Phoenix Desert Ridge in Phoenix. Early bird registration is $999 until 28 April 2017 after which it goes up by $100. Apple Market Forum: August 2017 -- Organized by Macworld/iWorld veteran Paul Kent and the Mac Observer co-founder Dave Hamilton, Apple Market Forum will offer “2 days of analysis, vision and insights into the dynamics, tools and technology that are defining the Apple Marketplace.” Details are sparse, but the AMF will have room for only 350 attendees so you’ll want sign up on the priority registration list to stay in the loop. iOSDevCampDC: August 4, 2017 -- iOSDevCampDC is a one-day “unconference” for iOS developers that will take place in McLean, VA. Stay tuned for additional details. 360|iDev: August 13–16, 2017 -- Claiming to be “the Leading indie iOS/Mac (and watchOS, and tvOS) developer conference,” 360|iDev is scheduled for August 13th through 16th at the Grand Hyatt Denver in Denver. Registration is $799 for indie developers and $1049 for enterprise developers. The fee includes hands-on pre-conference training, lunch every day, and receptions on the first two days. Speaker and session details aren’t yet available. Indie DevStock: September 2017 -- A conference for developers at the Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center in Nashville, Indie DevStock is organized by women and will probably take place in September. No details are yet available. Sign up for their mailing list to be notified when tickets go on sale. try! Swift: September and November 2017 -- While the Tokyo instantiation of this conference is already over, try! Swift is returning to New York City in September and expanding to Bangalore in November. Details have yet to be announced, but try! Swift is described as “an immersive community gathering about Swift Language Best Practices, Application Development in Swift, Server-Side Swift, Open Source Swift, and the Swift Community.” You can sign up to receive more information. iOSDevUK: September 4–7, 2017 -- Focused on iOS development topics, the seventh installment of iOSDevUK will take place from September 4th through 7th. No other details are forthcoming, although the organizers say that tickets will go on sale before Easter. iBooks Author Conference: October 12–13, 2017 -- A gathering of the iBooks Author user community at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, the iBooks Author Conference focuses on educators, entrepreneurs, trainers, and authors. The main conference will be on October 12th and 13th. Early bird admission is $560 through 1 April 2017 with the price jumping by $70 after that. The keynote speaker will be Scott Bolton, a NASA astrophysicist and author of “Destination: Jupiter.” Other speakers will include the Apple Distinguished Educator Jason LaMar, Denise Clifton of Tandemvines Publishing, and author Luke Asa Guidici. Release Notes: October 16–18, 2017 -- While many conferences aimed at Mac and iOS developers have some sessions that cover business issues, the Release Notes conference aims squarely at that topic, building in plenty of time for essential networking. Scheduled for October 16th through 18th in Chicago. Details about speakers, sessions, and registration prices aren’t yet available, but you can sign up to be alerted when they’re decided upon. Last year’s speakers included Christina Warren of Gizmodo, David Sparks of MacSparky, Stephen Hackett of Relay FM, Jaimee Newberry of MartianCraft, and Rich Siegel of Bare Bones Software. MacTrack Legal: October 19–21, 2017 -- If you’re a Mac-using lawyer, check out the MacTrack Legal conference, held at Disney World in Orlando, FL. Speakers will include Katie Floyd, an attorney who co-hosts the Mac Power Users podcast with David Sparks of MacSparky, Randy Juip, and Tom Lambotte. Sessions will cover document workflow, communicating via video, GTD productivity, automated marketing systems, best practices in case management, and intermediate to advanced PDF work. The conference hotel is within walking distance of Disney’s Epcot, and the conference will overlap with the Epcot International Food & Wine Festival for anyone who wants to venture out of the conference or bring a spouse looking for something else to do. Early bird tickets cost $725 through 1 May 2017, with general admission after that priced at $825 and last-minute registration at $925. You can save $50 by using the coupon code TIDBITS. Jamf Nation User Conference: October 24–26, 2017 -- Much of being an Apple IT administrator these days involves device management. Jamf, one of the leading suppliers of device management systems with Jamf Pro (previously known as Casper) and Jamf Now (previously called Bushel), puts on the Jamf Nation User Conference (JNUC) with the purpose of “empowering people, transforming business processes and making IT life easier.” Held in downtown Minneapolis, the JNUC provides product demo and preview sessions, in-depth tech sessions, sessions dedicated to Apple services, and certification courses. Registration fees range from $499 to $1099, depending on when you sign up and if you’re in the education market. MacTech Conference: November 15–17, 2017 -- While the MacTech Pro events fit into a single day and travel around the country, the Los Angeles-based MacTech Conference offers attendees three days of sessions, seminars, and vendor interaction, plus pre-conference workshops and a pair of superlative evening activities. We’ve attended a number of times (see “MacTech Conference 2012 Opens Mental Doors,” 22 October 2012, “MacTech Conference 2013 Abounds with Networking and Fun,” 11 November 2013, and “Three Highlights from MacTech Conference 2015,” 9 November 2015) and recommend it to Apple IT professionals. It’s too early for there to be a list of speakers or sessions, but now is a good time to pencil MacTech Conference onto your calendar for November 15th through 17th, with pre-conference workshops on the 14th. Early bird tickets currently cost $949; the price will rise to $1599 eventually.

Reply Henry Larsen  2017-03-20 23:41 Sorry, but in this article you guys repeatedly set off a loud annoyance buzzer for me and, I expect, more than a few others. What's the problem? Well, here are a few examples: Mdevcon: ... Amsterdam, Netherlands IOSCon: ... London, England Don't all educated people (such as those who might be interested in attending a tech conference) know where Amsterdam is?!? (And it's 'the Netherlands' by the way.) If you mean Amsterdam, New York, then, OK, specify that. Otherwise the city name suffices. Likewise London. CocoaConf: ... Chicago, IL Is there even another Chicago, anywhere? App Builders Switzerland: ... Zürich, Switzerland Gosh, do you really think your readers are so stupid that they might think the App Builders _Switzerland_ conference is possibly in Zürich, Alabama? &c., &c., &c. Now, I understand that most of your readers are American and many observers have noted that Americans may be more geographically challenged than others -- but that's no reason to pander to them. Reply Adam Engst   2017-03-21 09:06 From a publishing standpoint, we juggle completeness versus brevity all the time. For this article, we chose to be complete in terms of providing U.S. states or countries with the city name in most cases. I honestly wasn't paying that much attention to the place names this time around in favor of focusing on the dates and other details. Now that you point it out, it does look a little awkward, so I'll go through and trim out the obvious ones. I somehow doubt that most people know where Crystal Lake and State College are, so I'll leave those. Reply Richard Smith  2017-03-21 18:08 On that note, a consistency issue, you have the list mostly sorted by date, so I'm wondering why MacAdmins: July 11–14, 2017, is listed above X World: June 29–30, 2017. Reply Adam Engst   2017-03-21 19:21 Good eye — fixed! Reply Anonymous   2017-03-24 02:24 This comment reminds me of ... never mind. Reply David   2017-03-26 19:22 Did you really just write ~150 words to complain about *that*? Reply Tom Harrington  2017-03-21 21:36 Thanks! There's also the upcoming iOSDevCamp Colorado, next month! It's an informal developer conference in Colorado Springs. http://iosdevcampcolorado.com/post/158134864828/iosdevcamp-colorado-springs-2017 Reply Darren Wallace  2017-03-22 13:20 Not sure how well this would fit in but we've just finished the second ever MacADUK conference (http://www.macad.uk) this year (2017). Although not to the letter of the article title, it is more than 12 months away :) Reply Adam Engst   2017-03-22 13:26 We'll put it on the list to include next year! And next year we'll try to get this article done in January. Reply Jim Schmidt  2017-03-24 09:47 MacAdmins has communicated this year's pricing via email; looks like someone missed updating their web site's public pages.

On May 17 the cost will increase to $799, so register early to save $200!" http://macadmins.psu.edu/conference/registration/ Reply Adam Engst   2017-03-24 09:53 Thanks, I've updated the article.

Chris Smith BGR NewsMarch 26, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share Apple will release three new iPhones this year, including the iPhone 7s, the iPhone 7s Plus, and the iPhone 8. The last one will be the iPhone everybody wants, thanks to a fresh new design and a bunch of features never seen before in an iPhone. There are various leaks that seem to be in agreement on what the iPhone 8 will have to offer, but not all of them agree on the product’s commercial name. iPhone 8 is the most popular moniker people use, but we’ve also seen a bunch of additional names including iPhone X, iPhone Pro, and iPhone Edition. Ultimately, it doesn’t really matter what the most anticipated smartphone of the year is called. But a new report suggests Apple may have already told us the iPhone 8’s real name. Don't Miss: Netflix has 25 new originals set for release in April – here’s the full list A recent Forbes piece suggests that the iPhone 8’s name may be already be known, assuming you can interpret Apple’s recent actions. Currently, Apple is in the process of rebranding several product lines. There’s MacBook Pro and MacBook for laptops, with the MacBook Air line having been discontinued. The iPad Air was killed too, so you can currently shop for iPad or iPad Pro — though an iPad mini continues to exist in the Apple store. Using the same logic, Forbes argues that Apple might begin killing off iPhone numbers this year. The iPhone 8 may simply be known as iPhone alongside the iPhone 7s series. Or Apple could use the “iPhone Pro” moniker to define the iPhone 8, and then simply refer to every other iPhone it’ll sell as iPhone. We would have iPhone SE, iPhone, iPhone Plus, and iPhone Pro. Ignoring the iPhone SE and iPad mini, Apple would have iPhone, iPad, and MacBook selling right alongside iPhone Pro, iPad Pro, and MacBook Pro. While this makes sense in some ways and the iPhone’s name might be better off without the numbering scheme, there are several gaping holes in this logic. For example, Apple would still have to find a way to differentiate older iPhone models. Every year, Apple continues to sell the previous year’s iPhone models right alongside the brand new ones. Also, “Plus” doesn’t really fit into this proposed naming scheme. Right now, Apple sells two different sized iPad Pro models that it calls “9.7‑inch iPad Pro” and “12.9‑inch iPad Pro.” With that in mind, why would Apple differentiate between the 4.7-inch iPhone and the 5.5-inch iPhone by adding a “Plus” to the name? Wouldn’t it just be “4.7-inch iPhone” and “5.5-inch iPhone” if Apple goes this route?

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Retail Image Source: YouTube Apple’s new RED iPhone 7 and its cheapest iPad ever go on sale at 11AM today Chris Smith @chris_writes March 24th, 2017 at 9:39 AM Share Tweet It’s not just a regular Friday for Apple fans, as the company’s recently announced red iPhone 7 and the brand new iPad are going on sale today. Apple’s website is currently down in preparation for the sales, which are scheduled to start at 11:01 AM EDT today. Don't Miss: Netflix has 25 new originals set for release in April – here’s the full list Apple earlier this week announced a brand new iPhone 7 color, a new iPad, minor iPhone SE and iPad mini updates, and a slew of accessories. You can check out every single new product Apple announced right here. The red iPhone 7, part of Apple’s PRODUCT (RED) campaign, looks amazing — check out a hands-on unboxing video at this link. Other than the red color though, nothing changes inside the phone. The red iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus each come with only two storage options, including 128GB and 256GB, just like the Jet Black versions. Prices start at $749 for the 128GB iPhone 7. The brand new 9.7-inch iPad replaces Apple’s iPad Air 2, and it looks like Apple is killing the Air brand across product ranges. The device features a better A9 processor and a better screen, and it comes in 32GB and 128GB versions. The new iPad is available in silver, gold, and space gray, and ships in the expected Wi-Fi-only and Wi-Fi + Cellular options. Prices start at $329 for the 32GB iPad, which is the lowest entry price ever for a brand new 9.7-inch iPad. Even a new iPad mini is more expensive, starting at $399, but the mini only comes with 128GB of storage. The refreshed iPad mini, as well as Apple’s new iPhone and Apple Watch accessories, are also available to purchase from Apple’s online store.

Renowned for its heavily hyped launches, the company’s latest version of its most iconic product has already generated an avalanche of rumour and conjecture. Apple has, as always, remained tight-lipped on what the product will unveil, a stance that has generated even more speculation than usual. Most observers agree the new iPhone will probably be launched in September, in keeping with its standard annual autumn introduction of major new products. Suggestions that it will break with tradition and add a letter designation rather than the chronological 8 persist, with many observers plumping for the iPhone X — a nod to both the tenth anniversary as well as being the Roman numeral for 10. However, the Japanese news site Mac Otakara believes the new model will be called the iPhone Edition — a designation the company used previously for a luxury 18-karat gold version of the Apple Watch which cost $10,000. Some industry observers suggest that facial recognition technology will replace fingerprint or password to open the device, supported by a laser infrared sensor. Recharging will dispense with the socket cord in favour of wireless technology, and the phone will reportedly have two cameras: a 12-megapixel wide-angle and a telephoto lens. While the anniversary will doubtless generate much speculation in the weeks to come, the opening of the company’s new Apple Park headquarters in California will likely trump it in the short-term. The new 175-acre site, dubbed the ‘Spaceship Campus’ due to its circular shape, will see employees moving in within the next few weeks. Built to house 12,000, the process will take over six months, with the ongoing construction of buildings and parklands scheduled to continue through the summer. Envisioned by Steve Jobs as a centre for creativity and collaboration, the estimated $5bn campus has transformed miles of asphalt sprawl into a haven of green space in the heart of the Santa Clara Valley. Its ring-shaped, 2.8m-square-foot main building is clad entirely in the world’s largest panels of curved glass. To honour his memory and enduring influence on Apple, the 1,000-seat theatre at Apple Park will be named the Steve Jobs Theatre. “Steve’s vision for Apple stretched far beyond his time with us — he intended Apple Park to be the home of innovation for generations to come,” said chief executive Tim Cook. Planted with 9,000 drought-resistant trees, and powered by 100% renewable energy through 17 megawatts of rooftop solar, Apple Park will run one of the largest on-site solar energy installations in the world. It is also the site of the world’s largest naturally ventilated building, projected to require no heating or air conditioning for nine months of the year. In a race to become the world’s first trillion-dollar company, Apple looks set to compete for this future financial milestone with Google and Amazon. With a price-to-earnings ratio below 18, Apple’s pursuit of the $1trn threshold has attracted the attention of legendary long-term investor Warren Buffett. In recent regulatory filings, Mr Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway revealed it had quadrupled its ownership in Apple to 57m shares, worth $6.6bn at the end of 2016, a gain of over $1bn resulting from a 17% increase in the share price. “As we look toward the second decade of the iPhone, the expectation isn’t one of another ‘big bang’ but a process of continuous improvement,” said Horace Dediu of market intelligence firm Asymco. He suggests total revenues from iOS products — including iPhones, iPod devices, iPads and Apple TV systems — will hit $980bn this year. “The Apple Watch, the AirPods, Pencil, and possible new wearables point toward a future where the iPhone is a hub to a mesh of personal devices,” said Mr Dediu.

Google's Play Store lacks a wide selection of apps that support a tablet's larger display, with most apps only expanding the phone interface, in turn looking horrible on the smaller screen. In addition to the lack of quality apps, Android tablets have lacked key accessories such as a keyboard. For the most part, Android tablets have been relegated to a device used to catch up on Netflix or to entertain kids with games. Samsung's $599 Galaxy Tab S3 is the Korean's company latest attempt to change that narrative. Well, as much as it can. After all, the company can't force third-party developers to build apps for a tablet. But Samsung has built a stylus and keyboard for the Tab S3, both of which go a long way in making it useful. After using the Tab S3 for just over a week, it's clear Samsung set the standard for Android tablets. This Tab S3 is the best Android-based tablet I've used, for work and play. In short: Business users who can't or simply refuse to use Apple products will find the Tab S3 a capable alternative to the iPad Pro. Specifications of the Galaxy Tab S3: Top ZDNET Reviews Dell Latitude 11 5000 7.9 Apple iPhone 7 Plus 9.3 Amazon Echo 9.0 Google Pixel XL Phone 8.0 Dimensions: 237.3 x 169.0 x 6.0mm Display: 9.7-inch Super AMOLED (2048x1536) w/HDR playback support Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 Storage: 32 GB with microSD support up to 256GB Memory: 4GB Camera: 13-megapixel and 5-megapixel front-facing Video: 4K UDH at 30fps Ports: USB Type-C Fingerprint: Yes Connectivity: Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 4.2, LTE optional, GPS Battery: 6,000mAh w/Fast Charging Operating System: Android 7.0 Nougat Samsung Services: Samsung S-Pen, Samsung Air Command, Samsung Flow, Samsung Smart Switch A familiar design Jason Cipriani/ZDNet The first time I picked up the Tab S3 the fit and finish of an iPad came to mind, and that observation still holds (save for the Tab S3's glass back). Just below the 9.7-inch display is a home button that doubles as a fingerprint reader. The button is flanked by a multitasking button on the left and a back button on the right. On the right side of the tablet is where you find the microSD slot, volume up and down buttons, and the power button. On the left side of the frame is where you find the Pogo connector for interfacing with accessories such as a keyboard. A USB-C port and 3.5mm headphone jack are along the bottom of the frame. All about that S Pen Jason Cipriani/ZDNet Every Tab S3 comes with a super-sized S Pen stylus for jotting notes or sketching ideas on the tablet's display. Unlike the Apple Pencil, the S Pen lacks a battery or any sort of Bluetooth pairing process. Much like the S Pen's functionality on the Galaxy Note smartphone line, you hold the S Pen above the display and the tablet automatically recognizes it is present. With the press of a button on the side of the S Pen you can activate Air Commands. A series of round dots are shown, giving you the option to do things such as take a screenshot or create a note. For example, using an Air Command you can take a screenshot then annotate it with the S Pen before sharing it as a means of providing feedback to a colleague. Unlike the Note lineup, the S Pen on the Tab S3 is the size of a normal pen. Latest review Battle of the Android flagships: HTC 10, LG G5, and Samsung Galaxy S7 All three of these phones are outstanding and are priced lower than a comparable iPhone 6s or 6s Plus. Read More As someone who owns an iPad Pro with an Apple Pencil, I was skeptical about how often I would use the S Pen. I hardly ever use the Apple Pencil, save for an occasional stick figure doodle in the Notes app out of sheer boredom. However, the Tab S3's screen-off memo feature made the S Pen a valuable tool. The feature works just as its name implies, you can jot down some notes without having to wake and unlock the tablet. Your note is then saved to Samsung's Notes app. I used this feature repeatedly to quickly write down an idea or create a list without much effort. Keyboard Jason Cipriani/ZDNet A physical keyboard for the Tab S3 is an optional accessory that will set you back $129. And really, it's something you need to buy in order to crank out emails or edit Word docs on the tablet. Samsung's virtual keyboard is good, but there's a lot to be said about a physical keyboard attached to a device that translates into productivity. That said, the Samsung Keyboard Case is cramped, and its small keys are something I'm still trying to adjust to. Just like Apple's Keyboard Cover, Samsung has done away with any sort of Bluetooth connection and battery. Instead, the keyboard is powered by a Pogo connector that pulls double-duty as a means for the keyboard to communicate with the tablet. Despite struggling to adjust to its size, I have used the Tab S3 quite frequently to reply to emails and type several documents. While it's not likely to be a huge selling point for the keyboard case, but Samsung includes an optional loop with each keyboard to hold the S Pen when not in use. Personally, I prefer the shallow keys and roomier feel of Apple's Smart Keyboard to that of Samsung's Keyboard Case. Performance and battery life Jason Cipriani/ZDNet Adding an S Pen and keyboard to the Tab S3 puts it firmly in the class of a productivity device, instead of something designed solely for watching movies. Speaking of watching movies, the Tab S3's display is stunning. It is HDR-ready for whenever streaming apps such as Amazon or Netflix begin offering the service. The overall performance of the Tab S3 with its year old Snapdragon 820 processor was with few hiccups during my time testing. The most prominent and noticeable slowdown of the device occurred nearly every time I used the keyboard shortcut of Alt-Tab to quickly switch between apps. Either the initial view of open apps would take a few seconds to show up, or quickly cycling through apps would cause the tablet to freeze then suddenly catch up to my commands. The same lag isn't present when using the tablet's multitasking button. Using Android Nougat's split screen feature to run two apps at the same time ran without issue. In fact, Android's overall multitasking implementation on a tablet with split screen apps and the mechanism for selecting a second app is something Apple should take into consideration for iOS 11. Samsung estimates 12 hours of use on a single charge, and I found that to be true. Standby time was also impressive, with the tablet's battery only dipping slightly after a couple of days sitting in my bag. Conclusion Jason Cipriani/ZDNet Samsung's Galaxy Tab S3 is a worthy contender to the iPad Pro for Android fans. It is reliable, offers similar battery life, and the addition of the S Pen and additional features can't be overlooked. It's unfortunate Android tablets are still plagued with a lack of high-quality apps. Although, Microsoft's Office suite of apps (that come preinstalled on the Tab S3), Slack, and Outlook fulfill many of the expectations and requirements of an enterprise user. Some have argued the Tab S3 is overpriced at $599, considering the keyboard isn't included. At the starting price of $599, you have to consider the inclusion of the S Pen -- something Apple charges $99 for for the same size iPad Pro that starts at the same $599 -- and the ability to expand storage through a microSD card items that justify the price. Is it expensive for an Android tablet? You bet. But this isn't just another Android tablet.

In fact under a bilateral tax agreement Apple did pay 34 million NZ dollars of tax on sales for the last decade of 4.2 billion dollars, but to the Australian office which handles New Zealand business. What continues to annoy local politicians is the amont of money Apple declares as profit in its Irish head office, and not just from New Zealand but operations around the world. Irish corporation tax is among the lowest in the world but the EU has just called foul on the practise, and has hit Apple with a staggering 13 billion euro back tax bill. Australia is about to pass a Diverted Profits bill modelled on the British law designed to crack down on tax avoidance. Apple’s revenues are currently running at nearly 80 billion a quarter, easily matching a host of small and medium-sized nations.

Last May, a Beijing patent regulator ordered Apple’s Chinese subsidiary and a local retailer Zoomflight to stop selling the iPhones after Shenzhen Baili Marketing Services lodged a complaint, claiming that the patent for the design of its mobile phone 100c was being infringed by the iPhone sales. Apple and Zoomflight took the Beijing Intellectual Property Office’s ban to court. The Beijing Intellectual Property Court on Friday revoked the ban, saying Apple and Zoomflight did not violate Shenzhen Baili’s design patent for 100c phones. The court ruled that the regulator did not follow due procedures in ordering the ban while there was no sufficient proof to claim the designs constituted a violation of intellectual property rights. Representatives of Beijing Intellectual Property Office and Shenzhen Baili said they would take time to decide whether to appeal the ruling, according to Xinhua. In a related ruling, the same court denied a request by Apple to demand stripping Shenzhen Baili of its design patent for 100c phones. Apple first filed the request to the Patent Reexamination Board of State Intellectual Property Office. The board rejected the request, but Apple lodged a lawsuit against the rejection. The Beijing Intellectual Property Court on Friday ruled to maintain the board’s decision.

By Steve Ranger | March 26, 2017 -- 22:00 GMT (15:00 PDT) | Topic: Hardware How will the Galaxy S8 differ from previous models like this, the S7 Edge? Image: Samsung Samsung's latest flagship smartphone, the Galaxy S8, makes its debut this week. Here's what you need to know about the week's biggest technology launch. 1. How important is the Galaxy S8 to Samsung? It's incredibly important. Samsung is the biggest smartphone maker in the world, selling over 300 million smartphone last year and accounting for one in every five sold. But following the Galaxy Note 7 battery fire debacle it was narrowly overtaken by Apple in the fourth quarter of 2016. Chances are that Samsung will bounce back into the top spot this quarter anyway, but it still needs the Galaxy S8 to be a success, because rival Huawei is coming up quickly. Gartner Research VP Annette Zimmerman told ZDNet that Samsung needs to act fast: "They definitely need a new flagship product to maintain their position. We definitely see one of the strongest contenders here is Huawei." Huawei has been delivering smartphones on a par with those from Samsung and Apple and adding high-profile partnerships like Porsche and Leica with the aim of becoming a global brand. If this continues we could see a three-way tie at the top of the smartphone market between Apple, Samsung and Huawei. 2. Is the Galaxy S8 the beginning of the end for black slab smartphones? Samsung Galaxy S to Galaxy S8: How the Android... SEE FULL GALLERY 1 - 5 of 12 NEXT PREV Maybe: Samsung has certainly stolen a march over Apple recently when it comes to design. The Galaxy S6 and S7 both came with curved-screen versions, and if the rumours are true the S8 might come with one as standard. That's not to say the wraparound screen adds a huge amount of new functionality, but it looks good and shows a confidence in industrial design that's nice to see when most smartphones are boring blocks. Expect to see rivals (maybe even Apple) adding curved screens to more devices, even if we never quite get back to the insane variety of devices we saw back in the feature-phone era. 3. Hello Bixby: But does anyone really want a digital assistant on their smartphone? Probably not: Siri and Cortana and Google Now are already crammed into our smartphones, but are barely used because we're more comfortable talking on our phones than talking to our phones. And yet the Galaxy S8 adds another digital sidekick called Bixby. samsung's galaxy S8 The launch: Six big questions - and answers Galaxy S8 will face many unknowns Why I'm not buying the Galaxy S8 this year [CNET] Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus tech specs Pictures: How Samsung's Android flagship has changed its look Why Samsung's approach to unlocked Galaxy smartphones is all wrong Samsung commits to monthly updates for unlocked Galaxy phones in US Bixby assistant will be expanded to all Samsung devices Where digital assistants do seem to be popular is in the home, where Amazon's Echo with its Alexa assistant is making a lot of the running. That could give Samsung an opportunity, because it has already said that it plans to make Bixby available across more devices. If Bixby can tie together the smart home and the smartphone via appliances like washing machines, fridges and microwaves, that could give Samsung a big advantage. 4. Does the flagship phone matter anymore? Yes: It's true the gap between the Samsung and Apple's top-of-the-range handsets and mid-range devices continues to narrow: mid-range phones have most of the capabilities that the high-end phones had a couple of years ago, and the functionality that's exclusive to the flagship phones (like mobile payments) isn't something that most people want to use anyway. And increasingly the mid-range is the new battleground. According to Gartner, the average selling price for mid-range phones is actually going up, not down as you would expect. People are starting to spend a little more money on those devices because they offer good technology at a good price. But high-end phones are still a growing segment, with healthy margins -- something that's lacking in much of the rest of the market. Also, as the smartphone market reaches saturation vendors will put more effort into persuading people to trade up to premium devices. 5. Is there any innovation left in smartphones? Maybe: Apart from the curved screen, there are suggestions than the Galaxy S8 will pack an iris scanner as well as the fingerprint scanner, which moves to the back. Unlocking your phone with a glance is cute, but is it really the innovation that smartphones are crying out for? Virtual reality in phones is still at an early stage, but apart from that it's hard to see what the next big jump forward will be. "Upgrading regularly is something that is in danger because we don't have the huge technology leaps any more. The replacement cycles are lengthening," noted Gartner's Zimmerman. Foldable, swappable, invisible: 12 visions... SEE FULL GALLERY 1 - 5 of 12 NEXT PREV 6. What does all this mean for the iPhone 8? Even more pressure to get it right. Once the Galaxy S8 is out, attention will inevitably switch the next version of the iPhone -- presumably the iPhone 8, presumably arriving sometime in the autumn. A successful launch piles more pressure onto Apple, and there was already plenty of that, considering the iPhone 8 marks the tenth anniversary of the original iPhone. Samsung has already managed to tweak its basic Galaxy design with the introduction of the curved screen: can the iPhone really continue to look the same?

DAVID GOODMAN/The New York Times | March 26, 2017 SHARE SHARE TWEET SHARE PIN EMAIL Steven Johnson, who became homeless after serving a 25-year prison sentence and currently lives at a Holiday Inn Express. Photographer: Jessica Earnshaw/The New York Times NEW YORK — Earlier this month, Mayor Bill de Blasio embarked on one of the more challenging and unenviable tasks of his tenure: selling the virtues of a plan to open dozens of new homeless shelters across the city. But in doing so, the mayor has chosen to embrace a level of self-scrutiny unusual for a politician running for re-election. “We had crisis after crisis, and then it dawned on us that we were doing the whole thing wrong,” de Blasio said at a recent town hall meeting in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. “Just like our predecessors had done the whole thing wrong. Because there was no reference to community, there was no reference to family.” Politically, opening shelters has been a difficult exercise for any mayor, including de Blasio, a Democrat who promised to address inequality and homelessness, only to see it explode to record numbers. His administration, after halting shelter openings for a time two years ago, is now planning to open 90 shelters over five years — instigating a rolling series of neighborhood battles not long before voters head to the polls. The calculation is that inaction would be even more damaging. De Blasio staked his political identity on aiding New York City’s less fortunate, and has been attacked by critics as an ineffectual manager. His critics had already seized on the issue, which has grown more visible on city streets. Yet the scale of the plan — a seeming deterrent — may work to the administration’s advantage. “If you put out an overall plan to show that everyone is sacrificing, do you just create a big target, and marshal lots and lots of communities against this idea?” said Norman Steisel, the first deputy mayor under Mayor David Dinkins. “Or does it help people understand the enormity of the problem and that it’s shared?” Days before he was sworn into office, de Blasio vowed to curb the growth of homelessness, calling a then-record number of about 53,000 people in the city’s main shelter system “unacceptable to the future of New York City.” But that number has since surged to about 60,000 people, and that does not include thousands of others living on the street, or young people and domestic violence victims housed in more specialized shelters. Under the mayor’s predecessor, Michael R. Bloomberg, the number of sheltered people increased by about 20,000 people during his 12 years in office — an increase generally attributed to the collapse of a rental assistance program late in his tenure. De Blasio said his administration is still grappling with fallout from the breakdown of that program. About 23 percent of all homeless families in the country are in New York City, which has the most homeless people of any city in the country, eclipsing Los Angeles and Los Angeles County by about 30,000 people, according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development. In pushing the plan, which also includes expanding 30 existing shelters, de Blasio recognizes the battles that lie ahead. One of the mayor’s first lessons in opening shelters came in June 2014, six months into his mayoralty, when the Department of Homeless Services rushed to convert the Pan American Hotel in Elmhurst, Queens, into a shelter. “We got the call: ‘Open it tonight,'” said Doug Apple, chief operating officer of Samaritan Village, a longtime nonprofit provider of homeless services that had bought the hotel six months earlier. The rapid pace surprised Samaritan Village and local residents. Apple recalled being in the hotel lobby and looking out at a sea of 1,000 protesters concerned about the lack of notice and the potential effects of the shelter on crime and property values. Apple said that since then, monthly community advisory board meetings and better engagement with local leaders have helped to ease tensions, and “the fears have not come to fruition.” “I won’t speak for the mayor,” he said, “but I do think it was a learning experience for us.” The mayor has said the current effort could reduce the number of people in the city’s main shelter system by 2,500 over the next five years. The administration’s belief is that people will be better positioned to return to permanent housing if they are in purpose-built shelters near family and community anchors, like churches and schools, instead of being sent to hotels or stopgap apartments far from where they had been living. The mayor’s plan calls for adding 18 new shelters this year to a system of more than 275 throughout the city. To make such an undertaking work, City Hall officials will need to go neighborhood by neighborhood to address local opposition, hoping to avert large, damaging protests. In an effort to be more transparent, the city is giving communities 30 days’ notice before a shelter opens, an increase from one week. Emma Wolfe, a top aide to the mayor, said the strategy was intended to make those discussions easier. “It makes it a much more logical conversation,” she said. “Even if you’re going to have some sites where there’s a massive flare-up.” Some level of opposition will always materialize. The city was forced to delay the opening of a men’s shelter in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, after a judge in state Supreme Court in Brooklyn issued a temporary restraining order on Friday in response to a lawsuit filed by several residents and civic organizations. According to the lawsuit, the city is “foisting yet another” shelter on Crown Heights, a largely West Indian and African-American community, in order to avoid “the vocal criticism of the affluent and largely white citizenry” in other neighborhoods. The matter is to be heard before Justice Katherine A. Levine on Tuesday. Though gentrifying, Crown Heights remains one of the city’s poorer neighborhoods, and de Blasio’s math — intended to match new shelter capacity with the communities where the homeless are most prevalent — will give wealthier, whiter communities fewer shelters than poorer ones. The de Blasio administration remained optimistic that it could soon open the shelter, despite the court action. “We are confident that the court on Tuesday will recognize our vital need for these additional beds and intend to move clients in as soon as possible so that they can stabilize their lives,” Isaac McGinn, a spokesman for the city, said in a statement on Friday. About 12 community board districts around the city currently have no homeless shelters. Among them is Community Board 11 in the Bronx, which encompasses neighborhoods like Pelham Parkway, Allerton and Morris Park. Of the districts with no shelters, it is the one that produces the most homeless: 807 homeless individuals listed their last address there in a recent census. Joseph A. Thompson, 78, a member of the community board who is also executive director of the White Plains Road Business Improvement District, said that if the city seeks to place a shelter there, “there’s going to be a wholesale revolt. He can count on losing all the votes in this area, I can tell you that.” But de Blasio has come to the conclusion that he has no choice. “Over years, over decades, shelters were thrown together, people were sent wherever there was a bed,” de Blasio said at the town hall event in Bedford-Stuyvesant. “It was always on the run and in an atmosphere of crisis.” Davana Miller, 26, has lived with her 3-year-old son for nine months at the Pan American Hotel, now known as Boulevard Family Residence. Originally from Brooklyn, Miller said that in her previous community, she at least had friends and familiar stores to patronize. “You don’t feel homeless because you’re in your home community,” she said. “It makes you feel like a person.” Steven Johnson, 49, has lived in the Holiday Inn in Maspeth for around nine months, becoming homeless after he served a 25-year sentence in prison. With help from the city, he now has an $11-an-hour job as a maintenance worker. Nonetheless, he expressed skepticism that the city could make its homeless strategy work. “The idea has merit,” Johnson said, before adding a note of doubt that the mayor could execute “something of that magnitude.” Over the past three years, the de Blasio administration’s tactics to tackle homelessness have been something of a work in progress. For example, de Blasio put a halt to opening shelters for several months until his administration could get a handle on how best to do so, following concerns over the Pan American Hotel and other sites. De Blasio also ordered his administration to focus on ending street homelessness, an effort that brought even more people into the shelter system. With a lack of shelter openings, the administration looked to commercial hotels, often in far-flung areas of the city, like Staten Island, increasing concerns that children would have to get on buses in the wee hours to get to school, or would not go to school at all. The city concluded that it could not sustain the patchwork operation of apartments and hotels, because it was in neither its own fiscal interests nor the humane interests of the homeless. At the town hall meeting in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Anna Corrado, 25, a married mother with two children living in a so-called cluster apartment — typically one of multiple units within private apartment buildings used as stopgap homeless housing — tearfully explained that she was placed by the city in Brooklyn where she said she knew no one, that her family’s unit had a rodent infestation, and that she was unable to find alternative housing with a voucher. In an interview, Corrado said her family, which has also struggled with a recent arrest of her husband, who was the only one of them working, could not find a two-bedroom apartment where the rent did not exceed her $1,515 subsidy voucher. Corrado told de Blasio that night that some homeless families placed in apartments in the same building had been staying there for years. “I don’t want to get stuck like them,” she said. She held her 2-month-old son to her chest. Her 5-year-old daughter was at her side. De Blasio promised to help. "Thank you,” he said. “Let’s give Anna a round of applause for speaking up.” View Comments Hide Comments Related Content Insults fly between Democrats in state Senate, underscoring rift What David Rockefeller wanted built got built Albany's latest scandal: 2 more accused of corruption Army veteran charged with murder as hate crime in fatal stabbing SHARE SHARE TWEET SHARE PIN EMAIL Premium Content Pianist Uchida awes capacity crowd at Union 10:11 AM 'Ethan was really struggling with his dad’s death' 7:04 PM State testing kicks off amid unclear path forward on opt-outs 6:31 PM Foss: Yates Mansion worth saving 6:11 PM Stay up-to-date with the Daily Gazette's PM Edition The latest news delivered directly to your inbox every day at 2 p.m. Email Address Most read in News 'Ethan was really struggling with his dad’s death' Hamburg Street construction to start Police: Teen's Rotterdam abduction account fabricated Jumpin' Jack's prepping for opening day, spring rush Man admits to raping runaway The locally owned voice of the capital region Facebook Twitter Instagram Google Plus Pintrest RSS The Daily Gazette Co. 2345 Maxon Rd Ext.

As soon as we heard about the new beverage, we dropped everything and headed out the door to our nearest Starbucks. Over the years, our Japanese-language reporters had often talked about a legendary Shaken Lemon Green Tea that Starbucks brought out ten years ago, so the news of an apple version had everyone’s taste buds salivating in the office. While ordering the drink, we asked the store clerk whether this was in fact a revival of the Shaken Lemon Green Tea from the Starbucks 2006 summer menu, but they seemed to have no idea about what we were talking about, saying they had no recollection of such a drink. Luckily, we had one of our trusty Japanese-language reporters on hand to help us get to the bottom of this tantalising drink mystery. We sat down to taste the good-looking green drink, which is simply made with apple juice and a spoonful of powdered green tea. Each drink is individually shaken by hand before serving, to allow the ingredients to combine evenly, creating a smooth, icy beverage ideal for quenching the thirst on a hot day. Despite there still being a chill in the air at this time of the year, we were happy to discover that the drink was surprisingly delicious! Each sip filled our mouths with the sweet flavour of fresh apple, before rounding off with the refreshing aftertaste of good-quality green tea. According to our Japanese-language reporter, the drink was on par with the legendary Shaken Lemon Green Tea from ten years ago. While that one had a tart, tangy flavour ideal for summer, the apple version was well-suited to the transitional months between a cold winter and warm spring, thanks to its sweeter, mellower flavour. Unlike the previous version, however, which was available around the country, this beverage has a much more exclusive run, as it’s only available at Starbucks outlets in Tokyo, Kanagawa, Chiba, and Saitama Prefectures. The drink is available in a tall size for 432 yen, including tax, and will be available for a limited, though unspecified time, so be sure to pop by a participating outlet to try one before they disappear into the ranks of longed-for legendary Starbucks beverages.

It’s about time I call for my own prescriptions, doctor, dentist, and hair appointments. So, when I noticed my Visa was involved in credit card fraud, I knew I had to call my bank on my own, too. I occasionally shop online, book flights and hotel or Airbnb rooms with my Visa, pay for my Rutherford library late fees through the electronic service, and I have monthly subscriptions to Netflix, CraveTV, and Apple Music. But when I noticed an unauthorized $125 charge on my Visa from iTunes, I knew that wasn’t my monthly fee for Apple Music. The $14.99 charge for family sharing occurs on the second of every month, but the three unauthorized charges — one for $25 and two for $50 — were made on the 19th of March. It was time to adult. I called the 1-800 number listed on my Visa statement, talked to a robot who could understand “complete sentences,” and remained on the line for around 15 or 20 minutes while being serenaded with elevator music before speaking to a human. The human told me to contact the provider where the purchase was made, saying this red flag from Apple has become frequent. He gave me the number for iTunes billing and I was on my way. I dialed the next 1-800 number and spoke to yet another robot. This one wasn’t quite as helpful. Maybe it was still learning how to understand complete sentences, or it couldn’t quite decipher my swearing and shouting for “BILLING” and “CUSTOMER SERVICE.” It directed me to technical support instead where I waited with more hold music before talking to a human. Apple’s hold music situation is much better than Visa’s. I was given a choice of music: press one for “modern hits,” press two for classical, press three for jazz, and press four if you want to wait in silence. I was tempted to press four because I like the sound of silence, but I chose one and was greeted by the Weeknd. A cheery Scottish fellow interrupted “Can’t Feel My Face” and walked me through getting to my account information, because I’m Aunty Grandma after all. Apparently, you can check your purchase history online. Who knew. The weird thing was no $50 or $25 purchases showed up in my history, just the $14.99 once a month. I guess this wasn’t weird because I knew I didn’t make those purchases. From there, he knew I needed to be switched to billing (which I tried to tell the robot), but he stayed on the line and made sure I was all set up. The next lady got straight to the point. She said there was another account affiliated with my own iTunes account. I knew it wasn’t me because my whole family is on one account, hence the family sharing, which is convenient but also not great when I get my dad’s Skrillex recommendations and my mom’s Shawn Mendes playlists. She explained this other account made three gift certificate purchases, totalling $125. The worst part was she couldn’t refund me because they were gift certificate purchases. She told me to contact Visa again, tell them it’s fraud, cancel the card, and get a new one. I was back on the elevator music train, waiting to explain the situation to yet another robot and human. They checked my card number, looked through the notes from the previous conversation, and knew the whole situation. They said unfortunately this is a common trend with Apple lately, where gift certificates have been purchased with someone’s card (but not account), and Apple can’t refund them. It even happened to the guy I talked to at Visa. He cancelled my card immediately and said they would refund the $125 in a few business days. I’d also be issued a new card with a new number. It was a minor inconvenience, and kind of scary, but I know it could have been a lot worse. Although this debacle took up my whole Saturday morning, and now I have to wait for the new card to come in so I can update my subscription services (at least Netflix and CraveTV, I haven’t decided what to do with Apple Music yet), I’m proud that my level of adulting has increased to phone conversations about my banking information, and I’m glad I caught the fraud early so there hopefully won’t be any other mysterious charges to my Visa. I’ll be checking to make sure I’m only getting charged the usual $2.50 from the Daily Grind, and $7.51 from Beez in HUB, but if there’s a $50 charge from the Daily Grind, I’ll know something is up and now I’ll know what to do.

WikiLeaks tweeted claims the hacking tools will not work on newer Apple products are false. Earlier, WikiLeaks called Apple’s statement “duplicitous.” Read: CIA Hacking Tools For Macs, iPhones Revealed WikiLeaks has been slowly releasing the CIA hacking tools, created to spy on people through smart televisions, smartphones and other household technological devices. The leaked documents explain how the spy agency allegedly used malware and physical hacking. The CIA has not commented on the authenticity of the documents but has said it does not target individuals in the United States. Read: Edward Snowden Calls CIA Documents 'Authentic' Apple said last week the iPhone and Mac vulnerabilities outlined in the #Vault7 dump were fixed years ago and applied only to the iPhone 3G, which was introduced in 2008, and iPhone3GS. Apple also said the Mac vulnerabilities were fixed in devices manufactured after 2013. “We have not negotiated with WikiLeaks for any information,” Apple said in a statement. “We have given them instructions to submit any information they wish through our normal process under our standard terms. Thus far, we have not received any information from them that isn’t in the public domain.” WikiLeaks said it was “likely” the CIA got hold of Apple products during shipping to infect them. Newer Apple phones, however, have digital security certificates that cannot be overwritten so if a phone had been infected, a flag would be raised during setup if the certificates didn’t match, Newsfactor noted. WikiLeaks reportedly has yet to share with Google, Microsoft, Apple and other tech companies details of the hacking tools the CIA used against them. The Collective Evolution reported that though WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange announced WikiLeaks would partner with the tech companies to patch the zero-day exploits, no relevant data has been turned over. “It is CIA’s job to be innovative, cutting-edge, and the first line of defense in protecting this country from enemies abroad,” the CIA said in a statement earlier this month. “America deserves nothing less.” Related Stories Silicon Valley Questions WikiLeaks Founder’s Russia Ties CIA's Hacking Team Working To Exploit iOS And Android Devices, Says WikiLeaks Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

Before its launch, Apple’s most ardent supporters were looking forward to a robust device that could actually carry the esteemed MacBook Pro moniker. While the unveiled device turned out to be a physically stunning machine with a lot of neat tricks, it was nonetheless limited in a number of ways. Critics of the 2016 MacBook Pro took issue with the machine’s limitations, including its severe lack of ports and unavoidable reliance on external dongles and ports. Its incapability for RAM upgrades was also heavily criticized, with some even stating that the Apple had all but removed what made the laptop a “Pro” level device in the first place. If recent rumors prove right, however, it appears that Apple might have an ace up its sleeve this year. According to a podcast from CultofMac, there is a pretty good chance that Apple might finally unveil a worthy MacBook Pro this 2017. Here are three notable things that users could expect to see in the upcoming powerhouse laptop. #Мнение: обновление линейки MacBook Pro – https://t.co/43MlnSdoDa#обновление #линейки #MacBookPro #Apple #TouchBar #USBC #ноутбуки #новинки pic.twitter.com/6bgdrbhkcM — R-Ht.ru Гаджеты (@r_ht_gadgets) March 16, 2017 Kaby Lake/Ryzen 7 Chips One of the most significant drawbacks of the 2016 MacBook Pro was found in its processors. While the device’s Intel Core i5 and Core i7 Skylake processors were capable enough, they were nonetheless underpowered compared to the chipmaker’s current flagship chips, the Kaby Lake processors. Back in January, notable Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicted that the MacBook Pro 2017 lineup would finally be equipped with Intel’s latest processors, which would effectively increase the productivity capabilities of the Cupertino-based tech giant’s professional-grade laptop, according to a MacWorld report. Other rumors suggest that the MacBook Pro 2017 would run on AMD’s Ryzen 7 chips instead. AMD’s current flagship processors have been making waves in the tech world lately, with critics noting that the performance of AMD Ryzen 7 chips is comparable to Intel Kaby Lake processors. Regardless of whether Apple opts for Intel’s Kaby Lake or AMD’s Ryzen 7 chips, however, one thing remains sure – the MacBook Pro 2017 would boast truly formidable specs. 32GB RAM One huge limitation of Skylake chips in the MacBook Pro 2016 was the fact that they could only support up to 16GB of laptop-grade RAM. Apple stated that while a 2016 MacBook Pro with 32GB of memory would have been possible, the tech giant would have been forced to utilize a desktop-grade and battery-draining RAM unit. With this in mind, Apple has opted to cap the 2016 MacBook Pro with a 16GB RAM unit instead. While 16GB of memory is adequate for most tasks, heavy users lamented that the 2016 MacBook Pro’s RAM was simply far too limited for intensive computing. Fortunately, rumors state that the upcoming flagship laptop would feature 32GB of laptop-grade memory, allowing users of the machine to perform intensive tasks seamlessly. Got a new toy today #MacBookPro pic.twitter.com/pQcH6sf3Jn — Scott Dougherty (@BmxDougherty) March 26, 2017 Better Radeon Graphics Apple’s most powerful iteration of the 2016 MacBook Pro was designed with dual-graphics, equipped with an Intel HD Graphics chip and an AMD Radeon Pro 455 unit. Unsurprisingly, this particular configuration was only available in Apple’s high-end 15-inch MacBook Pro, which is the most expensive variant of the device. Fortunately, rumors are high that the 2017 MacBook Pro would utilize a more powerful GPU, such as the Radeon RX 500 unit. If these rumors prove true, the upcoming flagship laptop would be able to perform graphics-intensive tasks without a hitch, further establishing the machine as a professional-grade laptop. The release date for the MacBook Pro 2017 has not been revealed as of date, though speculations are high that the device would be released sometime in October this year. Pricing for the devices remain unknown, but rumors are high that the powerhouse laptop would be priced at a premium.

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady Apple’s upcoming 9.7-inch iPad will arrive “next week” in Apple Store, other retail locations Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Thursday, March 23rd, 2017, 05:22 Category: Hardware, iPad, News, retail Albeit you’ll be able to snag the newly-announced 9.7-inch iPad on Friday, Apple has stated that customers who want to buy it in Apple Store and other retail locations will need to wait until “next week,” according to Apple. Apple has provided a bit more information on the new iPad shopping situation. Orders placed on Friday, the first day of availability, will arrive the following week at some point, with no specific day given. Other retailers, such as Target and Best Buy, have stated that they are expecting stock of the new 9.7-inch tablet around the beginning of April with orders starting on Friday, the same as the Apple online store.

Well, on the back side, that is. What you can argue against is Apple’s choice to go with the white plate on the display side of the device as opposed to black. This is, of course, a purely subjective criticism, but it’s one that many users have been vocal about online. Fortunately, YouTuber Danny Winget is already to fulfill our imaginations of what a black and red iPhone 7 would look like and how much better it would be. He managed to already get his hands on a (PRODUCT)RED iPhone 7 Plus, and created a video of pairing it with the black display and internal components of a Jet Black iPhone 7 Plus. Admitting that this project was “a little bit daunting,” Winget had to do much more than just swap the front plate with white bezels for a black one, as separating the display from the logic board would permanently disable the iPhone’s Touch ID fingerprint sensor. He had to go as far as completely disassembling the two phones, essentially resulting in a black iPhone 7 Plus that has had its aluminum chassis replaced. Hands on with (PRODUCT)RED iPhone 7 Plus It should go without saying that this modification is an “at your own risk” project, it requires not only purchasing two iPhones, but ruining one in the teardown process, destroying the waterproof seal on the red model, and simply hoping that nothing serious goes wrong when trying to put it all back together. The end result, however, is almost worth it. Just look at how stunning the iPhone 7 looks in red and black after Winget finishes. We can only hope Apple goes with this color combination next time.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 26 March 2017 by Military News Why Apple Is Letting Oppo and Vivo Win in China Local smartphone brands Oppo and Vivo have taken the Chinese smartphone market by storm in the past few years. During 2016, both brands — subsidiaries of BBK Electronics — surpassed Apple ‚s(NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhone in terms of unit sales in China. Last week, Oppo and Vivo founder Duan Yongping talked about how Oppo and Vivo took the China sales crown from Apple. „Apple couldn’t beat us in China because even they have flaws,” he said in an exclusive interview with Bloomberg . „They’re maybe too stubborn sometimes. They made a lot of great things, like their operating system, but we surpass them in other areas.” However, it’s too early to know whether the Oppo and Vivo brands will have staying power. Moreover, if they have surpassed Apple in terms of unit sales in China, it’s only because Apple is letting them win that battle. Oppo and Vivo are rising rapidly Just five years ago, Oppo and Vivo together held a measly 3% of the Chinese smartphone market. As recently as 2014, Xiaomi (and to a lesser extent Lenovo and Huawei) was the top domestic smartphone brands in China. Oppo and Vivo were just also-rans. However, both brands’ sales have surged since 2015, thanks to their investments in building a massive retail presence, particularly in smaller cities. The smartphone market in China’s tier 1 cities is already quite mature, but in smaller markets, there are still lots of first-time buyers — and thus, more growth opportunities. Oppo’s flagship R9 phone has become a huge hit in China. Image source: Oppo. Oppo and Vivo really hit their stride in 2016. Combined shipments for the two brands in China more than doubled to nearly 150 million units. For the full year, Oppo led the market with a 16.8% shipment share, while Vivo was in third place with 14.8% market share. Meanwhile, Apple’s shipments in China fell by 23% last year to 44.9 million units. That left it in fourth place with a 9.6% share of the market. Apple is earning all of the profit Many pundits have lamented Apple’s loss of market share in China to rivals like Oppo and Vivo in the past two years. Duan Yongping attributes his brands’ success largely to their willingness to provide high-end features at a reasonable price. Apple hasn’t ignored this strategy because it is stubborn. It has done so in order to maximize its earnings. (And to some extent, to protect the long-term value of the Apple brand.) Indeed, while Apple posted its first-ever annual decline in iPhone sales last year, it still cleaned up in terms of profitability. For 2016, Apple captured an incredible 79% of global smartphone industry profits with just 14.5% market share. Apple still rakes in the vast majority of smartphone industry profit. Image source: Apple. Apple probably earns at least $300 of profit on each high-end smartphone it sells in China. In order to appeal to more cost-conscious consumers, it would have to either offer a cheaper, lower-quality iPhone model or create a lower-priced iPhone with all (or nearly all) the same bells and whistles as its flagship devices. In the first case, Apple would risk tarnishing its brand — and it still might not gain that many incremental sales. The second strategy would probably drive a big increase in unit sales, but it would cannibalize sales of Apple’s pricier phones due to a lack of differentiation between them. If Apple were earning $50 in profit per phone sold in China due to price cuts, it would need to sell six times as many iPhones as it does now just to make the same amount of profit. Oppo and Vivo have offered a great mix of price and quality in order to gain market share. However, BBK is a private company, so nobody knows whether it is making much money with this strategy. Can China’s home-grown brands maintain their success? It’s also not clear that Oppo and Vivo will be able to maintain their recent sales gains. Not too long ago, Xiaomi seemed to be on the road to dominance in China — yet it has run out of steam in the past year or two. In fact, Apple analyst Katy Huberty recently noted that survey evidence points to low brand loyalty among Oppo and Vivo customers. As of last spring, just 24% of Oppo smartphone owners planned to buy another Oppo device when it comes time to upgrade. For Vivo smartphone owners, the figure was 19%. Many of those Oppo and Vivo customers are planning to defect to Apple. In that same survey, 24% of Oppo owners and 38% of Vivo owners said they wanted to get an iPhone as their next smartphone. The iPhone functions as a status symbol in China, so it’s not that surprising that many consumers aspire to trade up to the iPhone when they can afford one. A market-share shift back toward Apple is likely to begin this fall, when Apple starts selling its 10th-anniversary iPhone. Chinese consumers are particularly keen on buying phones that look distinct from older models, and this year’s new iPhone will fit the bill, as it is expected to introduce the first major design change since 2014. There will always be room for Chinese smartphone vendors like Oppo and Vivo. In a country where an iPhone costs as much as a month of salary for many workers, it’s understandable that plenty of consumers will settle for lower-cost options. But talk of Oppo and Vivo outmaneuvering Apple in China misses the point. 10 stocks we like better than Apple When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

You can fix a frozen iPhone in 10 seconds without a computer or any other accessories so that you can get back with your day. You can also use this to fix a frozen iPad. Sometimes a frozen iPhone will not let you do any type of activity, and often you are stuck on-screen in an app or on a home screen. This can also help if your iPhone is stuck off and won’t turn on, but mainly you will use this when the iPhone is stuck on with an app or something on-screen. This is a hard-reboot, but some people will call it a hard-reset. Don’t worry about the reset part of this name. You are not resetting the iPhone like you would with a factory reset that wipes all the data clean. Fix your frozen iPhone in seconds. This may not solve all of your problems. If the iPhone freezes regularly you may need to remove an app or perform an actual factory reset on your iPhone and start from scratch. It’s normal for an iPhone to freeze once or twice in a year after you install a bad app or run into a problem. If things continue to freeze or go bad, there may be a hardware problem that requires a trip to an Apple Store. Fix a Frozen iPhone in 10 Seconds You can fix a frozen iPhone in about ten seconds by pressing and holding the power and home button at the same time until the iPhone restarts. If you have the iPhone 7, you need to press the volume down and the power button at the same time. Once the iPhone screen changes from the frozen state to showing an Apple logo or just a blank screen you can let go. This is a hard reboot. By pressing and holding the home button and power button you force the iPhone to restart. This is similar to holding the power button on a Macbook or laptop or just unplugging a device from power. You’ll see this screen when you fix a frozen iPhone. You don’t need to hold the power buttons after the phone restarts. You should not lose any data doing this, but if you were typing a message, document or working on something inside of an app you may lose that small bit of work depending on when it saved. You don’t need to be plugged in to power or connected to a computer to use this method of fixing a frozen iPhone. If the battery is low, it may help to plug-in to power, but otherwise you are good to do this anytime the iPhone is frozen. This works on any iPhone, iPad or iPod touch on any version of Apple’s software including iOS 5, iOS 6, iOS 7, iOS 8, iOS 9 and the upcoming iOS 10. Read: iOS 10 Tips and Tricks For users who consistently have this problem, it may be good to uninstall a problem app or make sure it is up to date. If you never restart your iPhone or iPad and you have this happen once or twice a year you can often avoid it by restarting you iPhone once every other week. If this is a continual problem you should consider backing up the iPhone to iCloud or your computer and then performing a factory reset. This takes longer to complete, but it can resolve problems. If you choose to to restore from an iPhone backup and the problem continues you may need to hard reset the iPhone and then set it up as a new device.

After using the Apple Watch Sport, which is now just the aluminum Apple Watch, and comparing that to the more expensive Stainless Steel Apple Watch, these are the reasons that the aluminum Apple Watch Sport is a better choice for most users. Apple announced the Apple Watch Series 2 in late 2016, which is waterproof up to 50 meters, includes a faster processor and built-in GPS. There is an Apple Watch 2 Sport, but it is chosen as options when picking the Apple Watch you want. If you need to use the Apple Watch to swim or run a Tough Mudder wait for the Series 2. Here’s more on which Apple Watch series 2 to buy. Most consumers are comparing the Apple Watch and Apple Watch Sport and asking which, “Apple Watch should I buy?” while they try to figure out which one to spend money on. You can read our Apple Watch review to find out how this device holds up over time. The functionality between the Apple Watch and Apple Watch Sport is identical, but the look and feel is different. The Apple Watch Series 1 Sport starts at $269 for the 38mm versions and $299 for the Apple Watch Series 1 Sport in 42mm. Apple doesn’t offer a Series 1 in Stainless Steel. The Apple Watch Series 2 Sport is $369 in 38mm and $399 in 42mm while the regular version is $549 and $599 in 38mm and 42mm respectively. We’ve seen deals that offer $50 off the Apple Watch Sport and up to $200 off the Apple Watch, so if you look for a discount you can find a lot of savings. Why we think the Apple Watch Sport is better than the Apple Watch. After extended time using the Apple Watch Sport and looking at some of the Apple Watch problems that come with the Stainless Steel model, here are five reasons the Apple Watch Sport is better than the Apple Watch. It is possible to find Apple Watch deals that drop the price of both models $50 to $100 which helps with affordability. We are already seeing a wide variety of Apple Watch accessories and there are a multitude of new Apple Watch bands from third-parties that plan to add new styles and cheaper options to change the look of your watch without upgrading. There are also a number of stands and docks that work with both models featured in this comparison for a more elegant charging solution. Apple Watch Sport is Lighter   1 / 5 If you aren't used to wearing a watch and you want to work out, the aluminum Apple Watch Sport is a clear win. The aluminum case is lighter which means you won't notice it on your wrist as much as the Apple Watch with a Stainless Steel case. The Apple Watch Sport weighs 28.2 grams in 38mm and 34.2 grams in 42mm. the Apple Watch is 41.9 grams in 38mm and 52.4 grams in 42mm thanks to the heavier Stainless Steel. A nickel weighs 5 grams, so if you want to feel the difference you can hold three or four nickels in your hand. It's not a major difference, but it will matter to some users. You can also try on the Apple Watch models at an Apple Store to see the difference for yourself.   1 / 5 30 Responses 07/02/2015 Patrick Jensen Reply This is the dumbest list I’ve written. Stainless steel does scratch, yes, but those scratches can be buffed out extremely easily, in a matter of minutes. Aluminum scratches however, cannot be buffed out and dig deeper in to the material. The sapphire crystal display on the apple watch is of much higher quality, a hardness only second to diamond. The apple watch glass or “ion X” scratches EXTREMELY easily. The apple watch sport is also too light, it feels like a gimmicky, cheap toy. The apple watch on the other hand, feels solid, it has some heft to it. It feels like a real time peace and not like a little toy. The apple watch stainless steel will without a doubt hold up better over time. Also, while all the bands can be interchangeable the sport model looks stupid sporting a stainless steel band or a leather buckle. The stainless steel matches well with all the bands, no matter which one. While I do appreciate the sport model as well, I feel as though this article was written by someone who is jealous they couldn’t afford the stainless steel model, so they resulted to bashing it and saying why the cheaper model is “so much better”. 08/21/2015 Stop Complaining Reply Did your mommy let you on the computer again? ;-) 09/14/2015 You deserve a facepalm Reply Hey! Didn’t your mommy ground you from trolling in the internet? 03/06/2016 D Camp Reply No, but it does appear that not only were his reasons “not” to purchase rather…lame, he left his spell check off. And THAT alone precludes me from listening to his reasoning. 02/07/2016 Wap Reply Calm down. People are allowed to have their own opinions you know? 08/24/2016 crafthouseimages Reply Good man. 02/24/2016 Just the Facts Reply You are absolutely right. Steal is harder than aluminum: http://metalsupermarkets.com/blog/10-differences-aluminum-stainless-steel/ Its crazy to say or imply that aluminum is better because its scratches less. This idea is born form pure ignorance. The author should simply amend this section stating a correction and swallow the pride instead of making some weird anonymous insults, in the comments. 07/31/2015 Kingsley Arthur Rowe Reply i pick my watch for most of the reasons you listed in your article great minds think alike. :) 08/14/2015 mj Reply It really doesn’t matter if it will “hold up over time.” This is first-gen tech that will soon be obsolete and replaced by better tech. It most likely isn’t going to be a collectable, and it’s not fine craftsmanship that will last for decades like an expensive handmade watch that you would pass down to family. I’m going for the Sport model, and I’m gonna have fun with it :) 02/27/2016 Luke Reply I love your thinking, I’m doing the same thing! Have fun with your Apple Watch Sport! 09/21/2015 Willenepjones Reply 0=8my friend’s half-sister makes $61 /hr on the laptop .

I just bought my first one and did go with the 42mm Sport along with the Armorsuit screen protector for two main reasons. #1 – Cost… $250 cheaper than the comparable Apple Watch model. If I don’t like this then I’m not out as much $$. #2 new model on the horizon. Didn’t want to spend $600 on something I may want to replace later this year or early next (presuming I still like the Apple Watch brand). You could add a 3rd reason though and that is while the Apple Watch may “look” better and the sapphire glass is harder (but not as much) those reasons (along with a “prettier box”) left me not to be able to justify the Apple Watch over the Apple Watch Sport model.

It seems like the one who wrote it, was choosing the sport because it cost less. I don’t really care about the cost. Im searching for reviews about the difference of them, because I want something that will last. Something that is durable, and that will withstand the weather, if it gets wet, everyday use. Im tired of my watches that I have to take to the store to change the battery every time they stop working. Tired of having to buy a different watch every time they tell me we can’t figure out how to take the battery out you have to take it to a jeweler. This article just said that the sport watch is a lot lighter then the stainless steel one, and that the prices differ by a lot. Also would like to find an article on how to change the apple watch band to a different one. 06/07/2016 James Reply If you need help with that Chris maybe you don’t need one. There really isn’t a difference in the watch other that steel,glass,and price. Also if you’re complaining about a battery then this watch isn’t for you. Only last for 18hrs before you need to charge it. 06/15/2016 ace Reply Stainless steel runs around the same tensile yield strength (really the best measure of strength for these metals) as standard aluminums. This will govern damage from impacts etc. Comparing the two on that level is kind of worthless. The elastic modulus (how rigid it is) of steel is about 2.9 times higher than the aluminium; given the similar strengths, this means that steel is 2.9 times “scratchier” than Al. This will mean that stainless steel will scratch Al and Al will not scratch stainless steel, and applies generally to how frequently a thing will scratch. It’s called the hardness of a material, and you can verify the info i have given by checking the brinell hardness of the materials: 6000 series Al runs around 95, while 304 stainless runs 265. Neither material is actually going to be fixed by polishing, but Al oxidizes when exposed to air, so part of that scratched material is actually powdered into a non-metal rather than pushed out of the way. At the end of the day, the scratch resistance is similar, and both kick the crap out of precious metals, let alone your skin, so i don’t really see this as a make or break criteria. -Structural Engineer. PS Please stop saying “steal” is “hard”. 07/27/2016 Rachita Reply Both has its ups and downs – http://techdracula.com/apple-watch-aluminum-vs-stainless-steel/ 08/23/2016 Chris Stanley Reply The writer can only be responsible for what he says, not what we understand. Stop crying. I read this opinion piece because I’m trying to make a decision. I can read many of these opinion pieces and put it all together and make my own decision based on my own desires and the opinions of others. If you don’t care about a 200 dollar difference then why are you even reading this? Just go out and buy one. 08/24/2016 cestasol11 Reply i like this watch 08/24/2016 crafthouseimages Reply I’d like to know if you can change the display, or are you stuck with the one chosen on purchase. I’d also like to know exactly what the features are; like, can you use it as a phone, now that would be cool. Does it receive text messages and other inherit features of our new phone devices? 08/24/2016 Brian Reply The face size and casing are part of what you buy. Sure you can get a band for an Apple Watch and put it on a sport but the watch case itself remains. Also if you wanted the larger screen then you would buy a new watch (because even if you find a larger face on the Internet it would cost about the same… the tech is in the face). You can make/receive calls (as long as your phone is in range w/ Bluetooth) but from what others have said the quality is same or worse than putting the phone on speaker. I do use it to answer but usually say “hold on… transferring the call to the phone”. Text come thru, simple emoji and preset simple replies but you can also use voice to text (which works except in loud areas). Again, your phone has to be in Bluetooth range. As I mentioned in a post back in April I bought the sport to “try it out”. I love it and would buy the Apple Watch but at this point waiting for (hopefully) the next hardware revision before plunking down the extra dough for the nicer one isn’t worth it. I’m hoping for integrated music playback (it can store music but you can only listen through Bluetooth). Better Bluetooth. Camera (because sometimes I want a quick shot without pulling out my phone with little regard to quality). WiFi would be really nice as BT lags sometimes. That’s on my “wish list” if Apple does continue hardware dev on the Watch. 09/07/2016 Malcolm McKay Reply All food for thought Brian. Sheesh, sorry for the late response to your reply. I think I may wait until the new one ships (I heard late Aug) Can’t wait to have a great Apple watch, lol. Sports are tempting but surely they must have a lesser build to be so much cheaper.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Mobile Opinion: Apple just made its best iPhone even better Opinion: Apple just made its best iPhone even better By Joel Hruska on March 23, 2017 at 10:00 am Comment Last year, Apple launched the iPhone SE. It’s the company’s last remaining 4-inch device, and it uses the same chassis as the iPhone 5s, but packs iPhone 6s hardware into the form factor. The diminutive smartphone was reviewed extremely well, but for one aspect of its design: Its low-end model was limited to 16GB. Now, Apple has removed that restriction and bumped the basic storage to 32GB, while keeping the same $399 price tag. In doing so, it’s transformed the iPhone SE into the best iPhone on the market, in my personal opinion, even if the guts of the chip are now 18 months old. Here’s why: First, the iPhone SE is still the easiest iPhone to grip and use with one hand. The iPhone 6, 6s, and 7 may only technically be slightly larger, but that small difference is increased when you add a protective case. It may not be a huge difference (in fact, it can’t be when you consider we’re talking about millimeters) but every millimeter counts. I am aware, of course, that there are plenty of people who love giant phablet phones, and some won’t be happy until the skit below becomes reality: Nonetheless, as a person who likes the ability to answer a call, type a text, or flip through menus while securely gripping my phone, the original iPhone 5’s chassis is superior to anything Apple has built since. Second, there’s battery life. Despite being built on older technology, the iPhone SE’s battery life beats the iPhone 7, as shown in the chart below, from Ars Technica’s review of Apple’s latest hardware. Data by Ars Technica The only Apple device that manages to beat the iPhone SE is the iPhone 7 Plus, which wins by a whopping 3 percent. In gaming tests, the iPhone SE is tied with the 7 Plus and 6 Plus as the longest-lasting smartphone, at ~374 – 377 minutes. Third, there’s price. True, the iPhone SE isn’t as fast as either the iPhone 7 or 7 Plus, but it’s also a heck of a lot cheaper — and you may never notice the processor difference since it’s pushing fewer pixels than the two larger phones. A 32GB iPhone SE is $399, an iPhone 7 starts at $649, and the 7 Plus is $769. That’s the base price for 32GB of storage for all three phones. You may not be getting quite as much overall performance, but even the iPhone 7 is 1.62x more expensive than the SE. Fourth, you get to keep your headphone jack. I won’t belabor this point; you either care about having a headphone jack or you don’t. Fifth, while mobile benchmarks are great for showing big numbers on devices, they aren’t so great at actually capturing the experience of using the device. My personal phone today is the iPhone 5c (16GB). It’s built on iPhone 5 hardware, which means I’m “rocking” a smartphone effectively built in 2012. I’m not going to tell you that I don’t notice the speed difference between an iPhone 7 and my poor 5c. Of course I do. It’d be stupid to claim otherwise. But the relative experience of using the 5c has degraded much more slowly than the discount iPhone 3G I bought in 2009 and was painfully waiting on by 2011. My 5c is effectively a year older than my 3G was when I replaced it, but it’s far more useful to me at this point in its life cycle than the 3G was. Smartphones, like PCs, don’t age as quickly as they used to. (I might love the SE, but I also find the video below to be hilarious). If you love huge screens and cutting-edge tech, this opinion piece won’t change your mind. If you’re an Android user, well, I don’t expect us to see eye-to-eye, either. But one of the reasons I’ve stuck with Apple is because it continues to make a small phone that suits my preferences at a time when most of the Android market has been chasing larger devices. The only reason I didn’t upgrade to an SE already is because the 16GB capacity stuck in my craw, and bumping up to 32GB removes that problem. If the screen size doesn’t trip you up, it’s arguably the best iPhone you can buy today.

Update: A T-Mobile spokesperson confirmed to 9to5Mac that AppleCare+ is indeed now included in some Jump and Premium Device Protection plans as detailed in our original story below. T-Mobile appears to now be including complimentary AppleCare services similar to what’s offered with AppleCare+ as part of its Jump upgrade program and Premium Device Protection (PDP) plans. The new support hasn’t been announced yet, but an update to the company’s webpage was spotted showing that the two premium Jump plans are now listed as including AppleCare services for those who have a new eligible device (via njtechreviews). The AppleCare services are now offered to customers at no additional cost on the two $12/month plans including T-mobile’s own Premium Device Protection service and its premium Jump offering that includes PDP: The best 4K & 5K displays for Mac AppleCare Services are now included in our Premium Device Protection offerings at NO additional charge to customers. If you add JUMP! or PDP and have a new eligible iPhone or iPad, you will be able to access AppleCare Services. While the webpage for Jump only lists “Apple Care Services” opposed to specifically mentioning Apple’s premium AppleCare+ service, it does seem to offer the same benefits as the premium offering with service fees from $29 for screen damage and $0 for battery service: T-Mobile customers who purchase a new iPhone or iPad will enjoy the following benefits of AppleCare Services: 24/7 priority access to AppleCare’s award-winning technical support via chat or phone Low service fees such as $29 for iPhone screen damage $0 for battery service Apple-certified repair or replacement at Apple Stores and Apple Authorized Service Providers Hardware service with genuine Apple parts Software support for iOS, iCloud, and Apple-branded iOS apps Hardware repairs and service backed by Apple Included AppleCare+ services were notably seen as a big differentiator for Apple’s own iPhone Upgrade Program versus Jump and similar programs from other carriers, so the move could make T-Mobile’s program much more attractive for customers trying to decide between them. Apple normally sells AppleCare+ as an add-on to the complimentary one year of hardware repair coverage and 90 days of AppleCare support it provides with every Apple device. It costs $129.00 to add for a current generation iPhone 7 and 7 Plus or previous generation iPhone 6s and 6s Plus.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 26 March 2017 by Military News The 5 Best Dividend Stocks for Beginning Investors Are you new to investing in stocks that pay dividends? If so, you need to know that not all dividend-paying stocks are created equal. That’s why it is important to be highly selective about which income stocks you choose to buy. In order to point you in the right direction, we asked a team of Fools to highlight a dividend stock that they feel is a great stock for a beginner. Read on to see why they picked AT&T (NYSE: T) , Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) , Anheuser-Busch InBev (NYSE: BUD) , Mastercard (NYSE: MA) , and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) . Image source: Getty Images. Don’t drop the call from this stock Dan Caplinger (AT&T): Beginning investors do best when they can invest in companies with simple business models, and it’s hard to get simpler than what AT&T does. The company that brought America the telephone is now most popular for its wireless telecommunications network, but the principle of how AT&T makes money is still the same: build up a high-quality communications infrastructure and charge customers a monthly subscription fee for using it. That business model has served AT&T for decades, and it currently is what drives the telecom giant’s 4.6% dividend yield. Moreover, AT&T has an impressive streak of dividend performance, having raised its annual payout each and every year going back 33 consecutive years. Some investors worry that AT&T’s dividend dominance could come to an end. Competition in U.S. wireless telecom is fierce, and some of the company’s rivals are offering services similar to what AT&T has at lower prices. Yet the telecom giant has been down this road before, and one of the things that led to the pioneering of wireless technology was the fact that consumers were no longer satisfied with landline-based local and long-distance calling restrictions. It’s uncertain what the next big innovation in telecom will be, but AT&T has a fighting chance at being the company behind it, and investors can count on the company remaining a viable competitor for years to come. Apple’s not just phoning it in Rich Duprey (Apple): Few companies are so iconically ingrained in the landscape of technological achievements as is Apple, which seems to come to define a niche within its industry as soon as it turns its mind toward it. From its original Macintosh computers to the iPhone, Apple’s innovations have been flipping the industry on its head for years. And all along the way, analysts have doubted its ability to grow. Back in 2006, they questioned where Apple could go since its iPod had saturated the market, only to be shocked and awed by the introduction of the iPhone one year later. They’re saying a lot of the same things today, that with iPhone sales on the decline, there might not be another technological rabbit to pull out of the hat. Yet, although the iPhone does account for almost two-thirds of its total revenues, Apple has far more irons in the fire than it did a decade ago. It is no one-trick pony (or even just two or three tricks). The tech icon is advancing its Apple Pay mobile-payment and digital-wallet service, which, by the way, can be used with your iPhone, iPad, Mac, and even the Apple Watch (yet another of the company’s advancements — in wearables). In particular, the services segment has grown to become Apple’s second largest revenue generator behind the iPhone, accounting for more than $24 billion in total sales last year. Services include not only Apple Pay but also iTunes and its app store, as well as iBooks and Apple Music. While they likely won’t ever reach a percentage of revenue proportional to that of Apple’s tech gadgets, services are likely to hold an increasingly important role in driving the company forward. Because Apple’s cash balance has continued to grow, the company made the decision to start paying a dividend in 2012. The current quarterly payout is $0.57 per share, giving the company a yield of 1.68%. That’s not especially robust, but no laggard either, and investors have every right to be confident it will continue for many years to come. So a dividend stock as integral to the tech industry as is Apple is arguably a basic building block for a well-rounded, growing portfolio. Cheers to a high yield Brian Feroldi  ( Anheuser-Busch InBev ): One smart way for new investors to get started with dividend-paying stocks is to buy shares of a company that sells products they know well. If you’re a beer drinker, the odds are quite good that you are already familiar with several of Anheuser-Busch InBev’s brands. Thanks to the recent acquisition of SABMiller, AB InBev now owns a portfolio of more than 500 beers. This includes 18 brands that generate more than $1 billion in annual sales, such as Stella Artois, Modelo Especial, Corona, Beck’s, and Bud Light. One reason that I think AB InBev is a smart buy right now is that the company is on the verge of driving profit growth through simple cost-cutting. As of the fourth quarter, management believes that it can cut about $2.8 billion in costs out of its business through merger-related synergies. The company has already delivered more than $800 million in cost savings thus far and expects the remainder to be realized over the next few years. Why we wait for those cost savings to be realized, investors can enjoy the company’s generous dividend. At current prices, the company’s yield is just over 3%, which is about 50% higher than the S&P 500 in general. Better yet, the company’s shares have fallen about 20% from their 52-week high over macroeconomic concerns in Brazil . I think the concerns are overblown and they are offering potential shareholders a chance to buy an industry leader at a discount. While AB InBev’s size will likely prevent it from putting up big growth numbers, this company looks poised to dominate the global beer market for decades to come. That makes it a great choice for new dividend investors. It may be No. 2, but it’s a long-term dividend-growth winner Jason Hall  (Mastercard): Mastercard and rival Visa are by far the two dominant companies in electronic-payments processing. Between the two of them, they handle a huge percentage of global credit and debit card transactions, processing payments for millions of merchants in hundreds of countries around the world. And while Visa is easily the much bigger of the two, there is more than enough room for both companies — and others — to ride the trend of electronic-payments growth that’s happening around the world. And make no mistake, there’s a lot of growth set to happen in coming decades. This is because electronic payments, as commonplace as they may be in many developed countries, still make up only a small fraction of global transactions. Two major trends are set to change that. First, mobile technology is changing the way people all over the world interact with one another, and how they pay for things. Both Visa and Mastercard are central to mobile payments, with their processing networks connecting merchants and financial institutions. Second, the global middle class could be 2 billion people bigger than it is today. That’s a lot more consumers who will grow up using digital currency. Combined, these two trends position Mastercard to be a wonderful long-term dividend growth stock. Its current 0.7% yield may not look like much today, but with a couple of decades of market expansion and cash flow growth, those payouts are likely to be much, much bigger. A dividend stock you can learn from Jordan Wathen  ( JPMorgan) : A good stock for beginning investors is one that you can learn from, and that you’ll benefit from following over time. For exposure to the financial world, there are few better than JPMorgan . Jamie Dimon has served as CEO of JPMorgan ever since it purchased Bank One in 2004, and he’s used his position to explain to the world what makes a great bank in his annual letter to shareholders. Never one to spare the details, he pens annual letters that frequently top 40 or even 50 pages, and explain in detail how he thinks about JPMorgan’s role in the financial world. They also cover topics like projections and predictions about the future of the economy and banking. With its hands in everything from consumer banking and credit card processing to corporate lending and investment banking, JPMorgan is a good way for investors to get introduced to every facet of the financial world. It’s worth owning a small stake just to get your hands on each year’s annual letter. Consider it an educational investment that pays a quarterly dividend, too. 10 stocks we like better than Apple When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The ban was the result of a complaint from Shenzhen Baili Marketing Services which claimed that these handsets infringed on the company’s design patents. The Beijing Intellectual Property Office ordered Apple’s Chinese subsidiary and local retailer Zoomflight to cease iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus sales in the country. The regulators were subsequently sued by Apple and Zoomflight and after a long battle, the Beijing Intellectual Property Court finally removed the ban this week after the court’s ruling that there had been no patent infringement. It was also accepted that due procedures were not followed by the regulator when it ordered the ban. The Beijing Intellectual Property Office and Shenzhen Baili will now take their time to decide whether or not an appeal is warranted after this latest development. Apple had also requested the Patent Reexamination Board of State Intellectual Property Office to vacate the design patent awarded to Shenzhen Baili Marketing Services and the request was turned down both by the regulator and the court. Apple may file an appeal against that ruling. Nevertheless, Apple can now start selling the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in China once again, even though those models are a couple of years old now.

You can settle down with a good book, too! Since the popularity of tablets, and subsequently large-screen smartphones, digital book reading has gone mobile. But, reading on a computer is still a popular past time, and for some, it's the best way to digest the classics, bestsellers, and undiscovered gems. If you have a folder full of eBooks and want to know which reader is perfect for your needs, you'll find what you're looking for right now. I'd like to take a moment to clarify that this list is for apps that you can download onto your Mac. There are some great e-readers that are web-based, but I've decided not to include them on this list. If you have a favorite web browser e-reader, please feel free to add it to the comments section so others can find out about it. iBooks Every Mac comes with iBooks installed. It is perfectly designed to work, not only on your computer but also across all of your mobile devices. So, you can read a chapter or two on your Mac, and pick up on your iPad or iPhone without missing a beat. There is a quick-access button that lets you browse the iBooks Store, where you can download content to iCloud and access on all your supported Apple devices. You can also drag-and-drop PDFs to iTunes from your Mac, so if you've got a great book that isn't in ePub form, you can still read it in iBooks. As for the features, iBooks on the Mac has most of the same tools and themes as iBooks on iPhone and iPad, like color options, text size and style customizations, highlighting tools, dictionary lookup, notes, sharing, illustration rendering, voice over, and more. If you are knee-deep in the Apple ecosystem, iBooks is the best e-reader on your Mac. You'll love the ability to sync your eBooks and audiobooks across all of your devices. Read our iBooks ultimate guide Kindle The Kindle reader on Mac is ideal for people that purchase, rent or borrow books from Amazon, which supplies the largest digital book collection. When you sign in to your Amazon account, you can access all Amazon books in your library. You can't browse the Amazon books store from the Kindle app, but when you buy a book on Amazon, it will be added to your collection, which you can access from all your devices, whether they are Apple, Android, or Windows. Amazon supports borrowing books, renting textbooks, sampling books, and more. It is especially beneficial to Prime subscribers. Prime reading offers hundreds of free ebooks, magazines, and more. Kindle Unlimited, which is a subscription-based service, lets you read about a million titles (including magazines and newspapers) for a monthly price. Kindle on the Mac has plenty of customization features, too. You can change the theme to white, sepia, or black, and adjust the font size and style to tailor your reading experience. You can also add highlights and notes. One of my favorite features is the ability to browse through popular highlights from others that have also read the book. If you have a collection of ebooks you've purchased from Amazon, or if you are a Prime subscriber, use Kindle for the Mac to read and sync your books across all of your devices. Free - Download now OverDrive Read OverDrive is the number one app for borrowing digital content from your local public library. All you need is an active library card and a PIN. Just like borrowing physical books, you can browse your library's entire collection of digital content and check out multiple titles at the same time. When you borrow an ebook or another item, you can download it on your Mac and access it as much as you want during your loan period. When your ebook is due, you don't have to worry about returning it to the library on time, it will automatically be removed from your Mac when your time is up. The OverDrive Read app on Mac is actually a web browser supported software program, but it's on this list because it is the officially supported app for borrowing books from public libraries. Although you have to access the OverDrive Read on Mac from a web browser, you can download content for offline reading, listening, or watching. You'll need to bookmark the page so you can access it without an internet connection, but if you remember to download the content while you're online, you can continue reading while offline. OverDrive Read includes tools for changing the color, adjusting the size and style of font, adding notes, highlighting, and voice over for some titles. It also supports fixed-layout digital books (like comics and magazines) so your favorite illustrated content doesn't look weird on your Mac. If you want to read digital books, but prefer borrowing from your local library, OverDrive Read is your go-to app for accessing your loans on Mac. Free - Download now Adobe Digital Editions Adobe Digital Editions (ADE) is an ePub reader that makes it super easy to read digital books on your Mac without having to drag them into an app or upload them to a cloud server. Once ADE is on your Mac, you can select it as the reader for any ePub file, so you can get started reading right away. I use ADE for ebooks that I get from HumbleBundle. I occasionally use it for ebooks I download from my public library, too. It supports all ePub formats and PDF files. You can add a bookmark and highlight text. You can also add notes to pages and passages. Searching a book for a specific word or phrase is as easy as using the Find feature on your Mac. If you download and store a lot of ePub files, and don't want to upload them to iCloud for reading in iBooks, ADE is the next best thing. Free - Download now BookReader BookReader is the e-reader for all files. It supports EPUB, MOBI, PRC, AZW, FB2, Microsoft DOC, RTF, RTFd, xHTML, Webarchive and TXT. No matter what type of ebook you have on file, you can read it on BookReader. It only supports DRM-free files, though, so make sure your digital books don't have digital rights protections before you try to use it. You can store all of your books in one bookshelf for easy access. It also has a few features that make book reading on the Mac a pleasant experience, like realistic page flipping, hypertext support, Text to Speech, and a fully customizable color option. You can make the font, background, and book border any color available on the spectrum. If you tend to download a lot of different types of eBook files, you'll be happy with the level of support BookReader has. You can download a free, seven-day trial version to decide whether you want to invest further. $9.99 - Download now Your favorites? Do you use a specific e-reader as your go-to app on Mac?

That and Amazon's support reps are friendly but generally don't end up accomplishing much. 1 5 days ago Reply DenverRalphy I'd think that Amazon/Kindle aren't ever going to be very quick on the uptake when updating the Kindle App for Mac/iOS. Especially after Apple made a move to attack Amazon/Kindle/And-The-Entire-ebook-Industry. Apple dug their own hole there when they made an aggressive move in an attempt to control the ebook industry. Now they have to sit in that hole. Amazon/Kindle owns the ebook industry now, and they earned it. iBooks is by far not further ahead. It's flashier, it looks cooler, but that's about it. Functionally, Kindle stomps iBooks. 0 4 days ago Reply Ron Skinner Books play a particularly important role in my world and most of my reading today is done on iOS devices. For books lacking important images I prefer reading on the Mini 4. For those having many illustrations, such as maps, I use an Air 2. And for large format volumes such as PDF formatted magazines I rely on the iPad Pro 12.9. Although I have a Kindle Voyage, and buy lots of books from Amazon, I almost always read them using the Kindle app on my Mini 4. My favorite ereader apps in order of preference are: Marvin 3 iBooks Kindle When forced to read on a Mac I usually use a MacBook 12. 0 5 days ago Reply Patches_McMatt Another +1 for the B&N Nook app. Interesting that it wasn't mentioned. Overdrive is great for checking out ebooks from your local library. 0 5 days ago Reply trix5842 What has me flummoxed is that the last two versions of Kindle for MAC have a Text-To-Speech function which I need. Because I can no longer read for periods longer than five minutes, why is this function disabled?

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile What if Apple already told us what it’s going to call the iPhone 8? Chris Smith @chris_writes March 26th, 2017 at 12:24 PM Share Tweet Apple will release three new iPhones this year, including the iPhone 7s, the iPhone 7s Plus, and the iPhone 8. The last one will be the iPhone everybody wants, thanks to a fresh new design and a bunch of features never seen before in an iPhone. There are various leaks that seem to be in agreement on what the iPhone 8 will have to offer, but not all of them agree on the product’s commercial name. iPhone 8 is the most popular moniker people use, but we’ve also seen a bunch of additional names including iPhone X, iPhone Pro, and iPhone Edition. Ultimately, it doesn’t really matter what the most anticipated smartphone of the year is called. But a new report suggests Apple may have already told us the iPhone 8’s real name. Don't Miss: Netflix has 25 new originals set for release in April – here’s the full list A recent Forbes piece suggests that the iPhone 8’s name may be already be known, assuming you can interpret Apple’s recent actions. Currently, Apple is in the process of rebranding several product lines. There’s MacBook Pro and MacBook for laptops, with the MacBook Air line having been discontinued. The iPad Air was killed too, so you can currently shop for iPad or iPad Pro — though an iPad mini continues to exist in the Apple store. Using the same logic, Forbes argues that Apple might begin killing off iPhone numbers this year. The iPhone 8 may simply be known as iPhone alongside the iPhone 7s series. Or Apple could use the “iPhone Pro” moniker to define the iPhone 8, and then simply refer to every other iPhone it’ll sell as iPhone. We would have iPhone SE, iPhone, iPhone Plus, and iPhone Pro. Ignoring the iPhone SE and iPad mini, Apple would have iPhone, iPad, and MacBook selling right alongside iPhone Pro, iPad Pro, and MacBook Pro. While this makes sense in some ways and the iPhone’s name might be better off without the numbering scheme, there are several gaping holes in this logic. For example, Apple would still have to find a way to differentiate older iPhone models. Every year, Apple continues to sell the previous year’s iPhone models right alongside the brand new ones. Also, “Plus” doesn’t really fit into this proposed naming scheme. Right now, Apple sells two different sized iPad Pro models that it calls “9.7‑inch iPad Pro” and “12.9‑inch iPad Pro.” With that in mind, why would Apple differentiate between the 4.7-inch iPhone and the 5.5-inch iPhone by adding a “Plus” to the name? Wouldn’t it just be “4.7-inch iPhone” and “5.5-inch iPhone” if Apple goes this route?

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Mon, Mar 27, 2017 - Page 14　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Beijing court overturns sales ban on iPhone 6 FAILED:The company that accused Apple of stealing its design has gone under since filing the suit in 2014, when it was a promising start-up backed by Baidu AFP, BEIJING A man browses in an Apple Inc store in Beijing on March 14. Photo: Bloomberg A Beijing court has overturned a ruling that Apple Inc’s iPhone 6 violated a Chinese manufacturer’s patent which saw the US tech giant ordered to cease selling the smartphone in China. The Beijing Intellectual Property Office in May last year had ruled that Apple violated design patents of Chinese maker Shenzhen Baili (深圳佰利) with its iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, and would be barred from selling those models. Sales were not suspended while Apple appealed against the administrative order. The Intellectual Property Court in Beijing on Friday ruled in favor of the California-based firm. The court “quashes the decision of the bureau” and “recognizes that Apple ... has not infringed the design patent filed by the company Shenzhen Baili,” the verdict reported by the state judicial daily Renmin Fayuan Ribao said. The office, an administrative body of the Beijing municipality, had ruled that the two Apple smartphones infringed a Baili design patent. It had accused the US firm of having “copied” the exterior design of Baili’s 100C smartphone, which is characterized by a curved edge and rounded corners. However, the Beijing court ruled that the iPhone 6 had features that “completely change the effect of the entire product ... and both phones are easily distinguishable in the eyes of consumers,” finding Baili’s claim was without legal basis. When it took on Apple in December 2014, Baili was a promising electronics firm, backed by Chinese Internet giant Baidu Inc (百度), and eager to tap into the telecom boom. The company has collapsed since then, hit by public criticism of offering products of poor quality and by China’s competitive smartphone market, which has seen many start-ups go under. Apple has had other intellectual property problems in China. A maker of “iphone” branded leather goods in May last year won a lawsuit filed by Apple as the court ruled Xintong Tiandi (新通天地科技) had registered the word as a trademark in 2007, while Apple smartphones did not officially go on sale in China until 2009.

Music Photos Videos Rap-Up TV Contact Advertise Artists Desktop Site Facebook Twitter Instagram YouTube RSS Google+ Music Photos Videos Rap-Up TV Facebook Twitter Instagram YouTube RSS Google+ Prev Next 3.26.2017 News Drake’s ‘More Life’ Tops ‘Views’ in Streaming Drake’s More Life has already reached greater heights than Views. A week after its release, the 6 God’s latest project has reportedly been streamed 300 million times worldwide — 50 million more than its predecessor did in its first week last year — on Apple Music alone, according to The Verge. Republic Records also claims that More Life could be at around 600 million streams worldwide, counting all platforms. That’s because, unlike Views, More Life was not exclusively on Apple Music. Still, much of the project’s Apple Music success can be attributed to Beats 1’s OVOSOUND Radio, where the effort was premiered. “What we saw on Drake’s radio show were TV numbers,” said Apple’s Jimmy Iovine. Apple has not released specific listener numbers for Beats 1, but the company says that the figures are staggering. “It’s the biggest radio station in the world,” added Apple Music’s head of content Larry Jackson. “There’s no way you’re going to find another station that has as many concurrent listeners and audience-wise as Beats 1, period.” More Life is expected to top the Billboard 200 in its first week with 500-550,000 equivalent album units (200-250,000 traditional album sales). This could be the largest opening week since last year’s Views. While Apple Music has benefitted from Drizzy’s latest, so has Spotify.

Brian Feroldi, Dan Caplinger, Rich Duprey, Jason Hall, and Jordan Wathen (TMFTypeoh) Mar 26, 2017 at 10:45AM Are you new to investing in stocks that pay dividends? If so, you need to know that not all dividend-paying stocks are created equal. That's why it is important to be highly selective about which income stocks you choose to buy. In order to point you in the right direction, we asked a team of Fools to highlight a dividend stock that they feel is a great stock for a beginner. Read on to see why they picked AT&T (NYSE:T), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Anheuser-Busch InBev (NYSE:BUD), Mastercard (NYSE:MA), and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). Image source: Getty Images. Don't drop the call from this stock Dan Caplinger (AT&T): Beginning investors do best when they can invest in companies with simple business models, and it's hard to get simpler than what AT&T does. The company that brought America the telephone is now most popular for its wireless telecommunications network, but the principle of how AT&T makes money is still the same: build up a high-quality communications infrastructure and charge customers a monthly subscription fee for using it. That business model has served AT&T for decades, and it currently is what drives the telecom giant's 4.6% dividend yield. Moreover, AT&T has an impressive streak of dividend performance, having raised its annual payout each and every year going back 33 consecutive years. Some investors worry that AT&T's dividend dominance could come to an end. Competition in U.S. wireless telecom is fierce, and some of the company's rivals are offering services similar to what AT&T has at lower prices. Yet the telecom giant has been down this road before, and one of the things that led to the pioneering of wireless technology was the fact that consumers were no longer satisfied with landline-based local and long-distance calling restrictions. It's uncertain what the next big innovation in telecom will be, but AT&T has a fighting chance at being the company behind it, and investors can count on the company remaining a viable competitor for years to come. Apple's not just phoning it in Rich Duprey (Apple): Few companies are so iconically ingrained in the landscape of technological achievements as is Apple, which seems to come to define a niche within its industry as soon as it turns its mind toward it. From its original Macintosh computers to the iPhone, Apple's innovations have been flipping the industry on its head for years. And all along the way, analysts have doubted its ability to grow. Back in 2006, they questioned where Apple could go since its iPod had saturated the market, only to be shocked and awed by the introduction of the iPhone one year later. They're saying a lot of the same things today, that with iPhone sales on the decline, there might not be another technological rabbit to pull out of the hat. Yet, although the iPhone does account for almost two-thirds of its total revenues, Apple has far more irons in the fire than it did a decade ago. It is no one-trick pony (or even just two or three tricks). The tech icon is advancing its Apple Pay mobile-payment and digital-wallet service, which, by the way, can be used with your iPhone, iPad, Mac, and even the Apple Watch (yet another of the company's advancements -- in wearables). In particular, the services segment has grown to become Apple's second largest revenue generator behind the iPhone, accounting for more than $24 billion in total sales last year. Services include not only Apple Pay but also iTunes and its app store, as well as iBooks and Apple Music. While they likely won't ever reach a percentage of revenue proportional to that of Apple's tech gadgets, services are likely to hold an increasingly important role in driving the company forward. Because Apple's cash balance has continued to grow, the company made the decision to start paying a dividend in 2012. The current quarterly payout is $0.57 per share, giving the company a yield of 1.68%. That's not especially robust, but no laggard either, and investors have every right to be confident it will continue for many years to come. So a dividend stock as integral to the tech industry as is Apple is arguably a basic building block for a well-rounded, growing portfolio. Cheers to a high yield Brian Feroldi (Anheuser-Busch InBev): One smart way for new investors to get started with dividend-paying stocks is to buy shares of a company that sells products they know well. If you're a beer drinker, the odds are quite good that you are already familiar with several of Anheuser-Busch InBev's brands. Thanks to the recent acquisition of SABMiller, AB InBev now owns a portfolio of more than 500 beers. This includes 18 brands that generate more than $1 billion in annual sales, such as Stella Artois, Modelo Especial, Corona, Beck's, and Bud Light.  One reason that I think AB InBev is a smart buy right now is that the company is on the verge of driving profit growth through simple cost-cutting. As of the fourth quarter, management believes that it can cut about $2.8 billion in costs out of its business through merger-related synergies. The company has already delivered more than $800 million in cost savings thus far and expects the remainder to be realized over the next few years.  Why we wait for those cost savings to be realized, investors can enjoy the company's generous dividend. At current prices, the company's yield is just over 3%, which is about 50% higher than the S&P 500 in general. Better yet, the company's shares have fallen about 20% from their 52-week high over macroeconomic concerns in Brazil. I think the concerns are overblown and they are offering potential shareholders a chance to buy an industry leader at a discount. While AB InBev's size will likely prevent it from putting up big growth numbers, this company looks poised to dominate the global beer market for decades to come. That makes it a great choice for new dividend investors. It may be No. 2, but it's a long-term dividend-growth winner  Jason Hall (Mastercard): Mastercard and rival Visa are by far the two dominant companies in electronic-payments processing. Between the two of them, they handle a huge percentage of global credit and debit card transactions, processing payments for millions of merchants in hundreds of countries around the world.  And while Visa is easily the much bigger of the two, there is more than enough room for both companies -- and others -- to ride the trend of electronic-payments growth that's happening around the world. And make no mistake, there's a lot of growth set to happen in coming decades. This is because electronic payments, as commonplace as they may be in many developed countries, still make up only a small fraction of global transactions. Two major trends are set to change that. First, mobile technology is changing the way people all over the world interact with one another, and how they pay for things. Both Visa and Mastercard are central to mobile payments, with their processing networks connecting merchants and financial institutions. Second, the global middle class could be 2 billion people bigger than it is today. That's a lot more consumers who will grow up using digital currency.  Combined, these two trends position Mastercard to be a wonderful long-term dividend growth stock. Its current 0.7% yield may not look like much today, but with a couple of decades of market expansion and cash flow growth, those payouts are likely to be much, much bigger.  A dividend stock you can learn from Jordan Wathen (JPMorgan): A good stock for beginning investors is one that you can learn from, and that you'll benefit from following over time. For exposure to the financial world, there are few better than JPMorgan. Jamie Dimon has served as CEO of JPMorgan ever since it purchased Bank One in 2004, and he's used his position to explain to the world what makes a great bank in his annual letter to shareholders. Never one to spare the details, he pens annual letters that frequently top 40 or even 50 pages, and explain in detail how he thinks about JPMorgan's role in the financial world. They also cover topics like projections and predictions about the future of the economy and banking. With its hands in everything from consumer banking and credit card processing to corporate lending and investment banking, JPMorgan is a good way for investors to get introduced to every facet of the financial world. It's worth owning a small stake just to get your hands on each year's annual letter. Consider it an educational investment that pays a quarterly dividend, too.  Brian Feroldi owns shares of Apple, Mastercard, and Visa. Dan Caplinger owns shares of Apple.

Designed for life. Made in Sydney. Available March 7. CREDIT: Tzukuri March 24th 2017 5 days ago /video/video.news.com.au/Technology/ Allen Liao attracted some big names to invest in his newly minted company. Matthew Dunnnews.com.au@mattydunn11 IF you told people you were dropping out of university to develop a start-up from your parent’s basement, chances are they would have doubts about your life choices. But imagine if your innovative product got backeing from several former Apple executives, including Jon Rubinstein — the computer scientist and electrical engineer who played an instrumental role in the development of the iMac and iPod This is the real-life story of Allen Liao. After studying Electrical Engineering and Economics at the University of Sydney for two years, the 23-year-old dropped out and went to work in the basement of his family’s home in Sydney’s eastern suburbs. Inspiration for his idea came from a life lesson that involved misplacing his friend’s expensive glasses. To ensure such an incident would never occur again, the Taiwanese-Australian created a solution — unlosable glasses. It took two years and a team of eight people to design and create the tiny electronics, new manufacturing processes and sophisticated software needed for the product to become reality. The entrepreneur felt he had a winning idea and this was confirmed when his company Tzukuri — a contraction of the Japanese word for handmade — attracted backers from tech royalty. In addition to Jon Rubinstein, former Apple heavyweights Ron Johnson and Bertrand Serlet also invested in the company. Johnson was hired by Steve Jobs in 1997 to build Apple retail from the ground up, while Serlet was primarily responsible for the release of the first Mac OS X. Other well renowned investors included Aesop founder Dennis Paphitis, Wordpress founder Matt Mullenweg and comedian Stephen Fry. The product is available as spectacles or sunglasses in two contrasting frame designsSource:Supplied The impressive list of investors came because Liao wasn’t afraid to reach out. “Many of our supporters and investors have come through a simple cold email asking for their advice,” he told news.com.au “If you show a clear willingness to learn and improve, and know how to ask a relevant directed question based on their experience, there’s a high chance you’ll get a response. “It’s an honour and privilege to be able to work with people who have changed the world, it wasn’t a difficult choice to make.” While the process to develop the product might have been extremely complicated, Liao explains the concept is very simple to understand. “Embedded inside the glasses are a tiny device called a Bluetooth beacon — a little computer which is sending out Bluetooth signals to connect with the Tzukuri App,” he told news.com.au “When you leave your glasses behind, you’ll receive a notification and the app will save the last GPS location you had them. “When you’re searching for your glasses around the house, we’ve developed statistical algorithms that can accurately determine the distance you’re away from them to the nearest 0.1m.” Having the technology was one thing, but Liao knew he also had to create stylish frame designs to make his spectacles and sunglasses commercially viable. All the electronic components are custom-made by a company in California to NASA-level safety standards.Source:Supplied Safety was also a huge concern, which is why Liao decided to have all the electronic components custom-made to NASA-level safety standards by a company in California. “Traditional consumer electronics use Lithium ion batteries, which can be unstable in high temperature environments,” he said. “Inside our glasses are batteries of a very special chemistry called Silver Zinc Oxide, which delivers 30 days of battery life on a single charge. “It also has a very high tolerance for heat — helpful when you leave your glasses in the car.” With the product ready for market, Liao had a soft launch online and got $50,000 worth of orders in three days cementing the appeal for his product. He also created a pop-up in the heart of Sydney to further test the demand. “Having a physical space to allow people to experience the tactility of the product and try them on has been very important — letting people feel how the frames fit, see the high optical clarity of the lenses, the lightness and comfort,” he said. “These experiences aren’t possible online and really lead customers to love our glasses. “The ability to demonstrate the app in person and set up the product in store for any of our customers has also served us well.” With things looking up for the company, the 23-year-old said he has his eyes on the future. “We’re only using 10 per cent of the available space inside of a frame using our manufacturing process, so the opportunity to continue to innovate is very exciting,” he said. “Although we don’t comment publicly on future product plans, I’d advise people to stay tuned.” Continue the conversation in the comments below or with Matthew Dunn on Facebook and Twitter.

(AP) — Sisters Bethany and Olivia Moy have known they were going to have their own artist's studio since they were both children. Bethany Moy, 28, and Olivia Moy, 26, both of Bethel, cofounded The Little Sisters Studio several years ago after they graduated from Academy of Art University. "Olivia and I, ever since we could hold crayons, we always wanted to draw, and we always wanted to be artists when we grew up," Bethany Moy said. "We were having a conversation one day (when we were teenagers), and I remember Olivia saying, 'It would be really neat if we had our own art studio.' And I said, 'Yeah, and we'll call it Little Sisters Studio.' We have an older brother, so I'm a little sister as well." After she graduated from art school, Olivia brought it up to her older sister again. "Out of school, we wanted to work on our own projects, so Olivia said again, 'Hey, why don't we do this?' So we did," Bethany Moy said. The Moy sisters are freelance artists who work on projects for various businesses in the area working on everything from art for DVD covers to illustrations in children's books along with regular commission work, Moy said. "We've worked with Mike Snavely doing DVD covers for his company, Mission Imperative. He is a creationist who teaches children and adults biblical principles," Olivia Moy said. "He started with children's DVDs called Ranger Mike - he's very Indiana Jones-like - and we did four DVD covers for him. We are doing two to four more covers, and another children's book in the fall." Children's books have been a passion for the Moy sisters since childhood, and their first project together before going to art school was a children's book called "Apple's New Neighbors." "Right before we went to college, our library was having a benefit auction, and since we were homeschooled, we always used the library for lots of different resources, and we really wanted to give back to them in some way," Bethany Moy said. "So, Olivia and I, being artists, really wanted to do something unique, and we both came up with the idea to write and illustrate a children's book to donate to our library. We wrote it, illustrated it and copied it ourselves, and we hand-bound the book." The book was printed at Staples, and Bethany, Olivia and their mother, Cyndee, hand-bound it together. "It was a real . pain," Olivia Moy said about hand-binding the book. "A real labor of love," Bethany Moy said, laughing. After the sisters graduated from art school they revisited their book. "We went through five years of college, and then said, 'Let's look at the book again,' and it did not look good, so we re-illustrated it," Olivia Moy said. The elder Moy sister agreed that they needed to do a new edition of the book. "I always loved how Olivia designed the original characters for the book, so I said, 'Let's keep as much of the original vibe as possible, but let's do it better now that we have been through college, and got our degrees.' That is how this project came into being," Bethany Moy said. "Apple's New Neighbors" is based on a pet horse and two pet goats the family owned when the Moy sisters were children. The Moys got Apple when they were children, and she had a companion horse with her who later passed away, so Apple was alone for a time, and was not happy, according to Olivia Moy. The sisters wanted to go into 4-H, so they got a goat, who immediately bonded with Apple. Later, they got a second goat who also bonded with the horse. That is why "Apple's New Neighbors" is about friendship. "They've all passed away now, but we've gotten other animals since than that we'd like to work into making a sequel, but we had to put that on the back burner for now because we have so many projects we're just starting now," Bethany Moy said. "We wouldn't be looking at starting on (our new book) until the end of the year." One of the projects they are currently working on is a short animated film project. "Bethany and I went to school, not for illustration, but for animation," Olivia Moy said. "Traditional animation like 2D, hand-drawn original Disney-style stuff which is very time intensive, but also very rewarding," Bethany Moy said. "It's your drawings, but they're moving. That's really why we went into art." Disney's animated films had a big influence on the Moy sisters with both women citing "The Lion King" as the first film that inspired them artistically when they were both children. "Later, when we went to school, one of our teachers, David Nethery, was a cleanup animator on 'The Lion King,'" Olivia Moy said. "Finding Nemo, even though it isn't hand-drawn, was a big one for me because I saw all the behind the scenes art they did for it, and I thought, 'I want to do that.' That's really what opened my eyes." Animated films are a very effective storytelling method, according to the Moy sisters. "Movies for us always told a story, and that was one of the things we were always drawn to - artwork that really tells a story," Bethany Moy said. "We've always been storytellers, and we always like to be able to tell a story," Olivia Moy said. "Everyone has their strength, and I think our strength, and where our passion lies, is to communicate stories with pictures." They feel they get their artistic side from their mother. "She started us, I'd say, with sewing. We had those little Disney cards with holes in them. It was like connect the dots, but for sewing," Moy said. "You had a piece of yarn, and you sewed through the card with it. We started with them, and mom was always sewing around us. She made us Easter dresses every year, bedspreads, curtains." Cyndee Moy always influenced her children to be creative, and never discouraged their creative endeavors, Moy said. "Whatever we needed, or whatever we wanted to try, she was always right there with the stuff for it," she said. "For my seventh birthday, there was a party for me, and people asked, 'What should I get for Olivia?' and mom told them art supplies. She said, 'Get her a big sleeve of computer paper, and she'll be happy.'" Bethany Moy agreed that she and Olivia considered art supplies to be the best gift for both of them, especially blank paper. "That was the best thing. We would get those big reams of computer paper - it didn't have any lines on it, so whatever you drew didn't have lines all through it," Bethany Moy said. As for the future, the Moy sisters hope to get more work doing animated films. "It would be nice, moving forward, if we could team up with an established veteran in animation," Olivia Moy said. "We would like to do lengthier animation projects in the future." "For both of us, that would be our main long-term goal," Bethany Moy said. ___ Online: http://bit.ly/2mIvDNW ___ Information from: Lebanon Daily News, http://www.ldnews.com Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

But Apple is still earning the vast majority of the profit. Adam Levine-Weinberg (TMFGemHunter) Mar 26, 2017 at 11:40AM Local smartphone brands Oppo and Vivo have taken the Chinese smartphone market by storm in the past few years. During 2016, both brands -- subsidiaries of BBK Electronics -- surpassed Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone in terms of unit sales in China. Last week, Oppo and Vivo founder Duan Yongping talked about how Oppo and Vivo took the China sales crown from Apple. "Apple couldn't beat us in China because even they have flaws," he said in an exclusive interview with Bloomberg. "They're maybe too stubborn sometimes. They made a lot of great things, like their operating system, but we surpass them in other areas." However, it's too early to know whether the Oppo and Vivo brands will have staying power. Moreover, if they have surpassed Apple in terms of unit sales in China, it's only because Apple is letting them win that battle. Oppo and Vivo are rising rapidly Just five years ago, Oppo and Vivo together held a measly 3% of the Chinese smartphone market. As recently as 2014, Xiaomi (and to a lesser extent Lenovo and Huawei) was the top domestic smartphone brands in China. Oppo and Vivo were just also-rans. However, both brands' sales have surged since 2015, thanks to their investments in building a massive retail presence, particularly in smaller cities. The smartphone market in China's tier 1 cities is already quite mature, but in smaller markets, there are still lots of first-time buyers -- and thus, more growth opportunities. Oppo's flagship R9 phone has become a huge hit in China. Image source: Oppo. Oppo and Vivo really hit their stride in 2016. Combined shipments for the two brands in China more than doubled to nearly 150 million units. For the full year, Oppo led the market with a 16.8% shipment share, while Vivo was in third place with 14.8% market share. Meanwhile, Apple's shipments in China fell by 23% last year to 44.9 million units. That left it in fourth place with a 9.6% share of the market. Apple is earning all of the profit Many pundits have lamented Apple's loss of market share in China to rivals like Oppo and Vivo in the past two years. Duan Yongping attributes his brands' success largely to their willingness to provide high-end features at a reasonable price. Apple hasn't ignored this strategy because it is stubborn. It has done so in order to maximize its earnings. (And to some extent, to protect the long-term value of the Apple brand.) Indeed, while Apple posted its first-ever annual decline in iPhone sales last year, it still cleaned up in terms of profitability. For 2016, Apple captured an incredible 79% of global smartphone industry profits with just 14.5% market share. Apple still rakes in the vast majority of smartphone industry profit. Image source: Apple. Apple probably earns at least $300 of profit on each high-end smartphone it sells in China. In order to appeal to more cost-conscious consumers, it would have to either offer a cheaper, lower-quality iPhone model or create a lower-priced iPhone with all (or nearly all) the same bells and whistles as its flagship devices. In the first case, Apple would risk tarnishing its brand -- and it still might not gain that many incremental sales. The second strategy would probably drive a big increase in unit sales, but it would cannibalize sales of Apple's pricier phones due to a lack of differentiation between them. If Apple were earning $50 in profit per phone sold in China due to price cuts, it would need to sell six times as many iPhones as it does now just to make the same amount of profit. Oppo and Vivo have offered a great mix of price and quality in order to gain market share. However, BBK is a private company, so nobody knows whether it is making much money with this strategy. Can China's home-grown brands maintain their success? It's also not clear that Oppo and Vivo will be able to maintain their recent sales gains. Not too long ago, Xiaomi seemed to be on the road to dominance in China -- yet it has run out of steam in the past year or two. In fact, Apple analyst Katy Huberty recently noted that survey evidence points to low brand loyalty among Oppo and Vivo customers. As of last spring, just 24% of Oppo smartphone owners planned to buy another Oppo device when it comes time to upgrade. For Vivo smartphone owners, the figure was 19%. Many of those Oppo and Vivo customers are planning to defect to Apple. In that same survey, 24% of Oppo owners and 38% of Vivo owners said they wanted to get an iPhone as their next smartphone. The iPhone functions as a status symbol in China, so it's not that surprising that many consumers aspire to trade up to the iPhone when they can afford one. A market-share shift back toward Apple is likely to begin this fall, when Apple starts selling its 10th-anniversary iPhone. Chinese consumers are particularly keen on buying phones that look distinct from older models, and this year's new iPhone will fit the bill, as it is expected to introduce the first major design change since 2014. There will always be room for Chinese smartphone vendors like Oppo and Vivo. In a country where an iPhone costs as much as a month of salary for many workers, it's understandable that plenty of consumers will settle for lower-cost options. But talk of Oppo and Vivo outmaneuvering Apple in China misses the point.

That in turn put Nokia into high gear to launch a lawsuit against Apple alleging 32 counts of patent infringement. Days later Nokia struck out against with two additional lawsuits (one and two). To add insult to injury, Nokia sought a cease and desist order against Apple from the U.S. Trade Commission in late January 2017. Today we learn that Nokia is now seeking documents and deposition testimony from Samsung Electronics in their case against Apple. Below you'll find Nokia's formal request to the Court.   EXPEDITED MOTION OF PETITIONER NOKIA TECHNOLOGIES OY FOR THE ISSUANCE OF A LETTER OF REQUEST FOR INTERNATIONAL JUDICIAL ASSISTANCE   "Petitioner Nokia Technologies Oy ("Nokia"), the Complainant in Certain Electronic Devices, Including Mobile Phones, Tablet Computers, and Components Thereof, Inv. No. 337- TA-1038 ("the Investigation") before the U.S. International Trade Commission ("ITC"), hereby moves the Court to issue, under its seal and signature, the attached Letter of Request to the Central Authority of the Republic of Korea. The Letter seeks documents and deposition testimony from Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., based in the Republic of Korea. The evidence sought by Nokia is highly relevant to the Investigation and unobtainable by other means.   Chief Administrative Law Judge Charles E. Bullock, who presides over the Investigation, has issued findings that the Letter of Request seeks evidence relevant to the Investigation, is reasonably limited, and is timely to the Investigation. Based on these findings, Chief Administrative Law Judge Bullock recommends that the Court issue the Letter of Request. Additionally, due to statutory time limitations on ITC investigations, these requests are often granted expedited treatment and Nokia respectfully requests that the Court expedite the issuance of the Letter.   For these reasons, as explained in more detail in the accompanying memorandum, Nokia respectfully requests that the Court assign a Judge to this matter and issue the attached Letter of Request as soon as the Court deems appropriate."   Nokia's request for judicial assistance was filed in the District of Columbia District Court, Washington, DC Office. The Presiding Judge in this case is noted as being Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly. .   Notice: Patently Apple presents only a brief summary of certain legal cases/ lawsuits which are part of the public record for journalistic news purposes.

In fact, now it's more expensive to buy an Apple tablet. By Brad Moon, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Mar 22, 2017, 11:55 am EDT Get AAPL alerts: Submit     View All   Popular Posts: AMD Confirms It: Ryzen CPUs Are Locking Up PCs Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Faces a Price War The New Apple Inc. iPad Strategy Is Sneakier Than You Think Recent Posts: Apple Inc. Watch Series 3 Could Cut the Cord Is Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Planning to Take on Apple Stores? Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Faces a Price War View All Posts Yesterday, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) announced a new iPad — called simply “iPad” — that replaces the iPad Air 2 in its line-up. On the surface, it sounds like a solid upgrade, with a faster CPU than the aging Air 2 and a $70 price drop. Source: Apple Look deeper, though, and AAPL’s consumer tablet strategy is a little more calculating than “faster and cheaper.” New iPad is Faster Than iPad Air 2, But … Apple’s aging iPad Air 2 was released in 2014 and powered by the A8X chip. While blazing fast at the time of its release, it’s getting a little pokey now, especially with processor-intensive apps like games. The new iPad that Apple announced on March 21 is equipped with the A9 CPU, which first showed up in the iPhone 6S in 2015. According to AAPL, the A9 represented a significant 70% processing boost and 90% graphics improvement over its previous generation chip. So the iPad should see a considerable performance improvement over the iPad Air 2 it replaces. However, a closer look at the specs show that the new iPad is actually thicker and heavier than the model it replaces. Considering the big deal that Apple typically makes about its tablets getting thinner with every generation, an upgrade that means going from 6.1mm thick and 0.96 pounds to 7.5mm thick and 1.03 pounds might be off-putting. Especially for those consumers who have upgraded every year to ensure they have the best iPad, watching each new purchase get progressively thinner and lighter. More problematic than the size is the display. The new iPad has a high resolution Retina display, but it loses the lamination and anti-reflective coating the iPad Air 2 featured. This is a step backward and as The Verge points out, for those who use a tablet primarily to read or watch movies, the old iPad Air 2 with its superior display is going to offer a better user experience. New iPad is Cheaper Than iPad Air 2, But… Competitors like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) have hammered at consumer tablet prices. Apple is setting the entry price for its full-sized, new iPad at $329. That’s considerably less than the $399 iPad Air 2 it replaces, although still pretty far from Amazon’s $49.99 Fire Tablet. However, the new iPad actually has the effect of raising the minimum amount needed to buy a new iPad from Apple. How does this math work?

Apart from being an obvious companion for the new GH5, the Ninja Inferno is the world’s first HDMI monitor-recorder to accept 4K DCI signals from cameras like the Panasonic GH4 / DVX200 / HCX1000 / UX180 / HCX1, Sony FS7 / Z100 and the JVC LS300. Support for the 4096 DCI standard unlocks cinema recording from these 4K video & mirrorless DSLRs. For the Ninja Inferno, like its flagship sibling the Shogun Inferno, we have created the ultimate monitor through end-to-end custom engineering of all components. It starts with a 1920x1200 resolution LCD panel and add 10-bit processing in highlights and equivalent 10+ bit resolution in blacks. This is achieved through the patented AtomHDR engine which when combined with our custom Atomos-built backlight allows the power of 1500nits to be utilized for High Bright Rec709 or HDR PQ/HLG at 10+ stops. The full-size HDMI 2.0 connection bypasses the camera’s internal limitations by recording to 4Kp60 4:2:2 10-bit pristine video in grading-friendly Apple ProRes or Avid DNxHR. The Ninja Inferno upgrades mirrorless and DSLR camera audio by including balanced XLR input and 48V Phantom Power, negating the need to purchase separate audio recorders. For on set review, the wide angle 7” calibrated screen, playback controls, playlist and XML tagging make the Ninja Inferno the perfect client or director’s monitor, with playout to the latest HDR PQ/HLG or SDR TV’s. The Ninja Inferno is equally adept in the editing suite as it is in the field with the recorded files dropping directly onto the timeline of all the major NLE editing and grading software with the HDMI input capable of accepting HDR signals to make the Ninja Inferno an unbelievably affordable HDR reference monitor for portable or in studio color grading. The Ninja Inferno, which is shipping now for MSRP $995, is the ultimate camera accessory for the GH5, the popular Sony FS7 or cameras with 4K DCI output & other 4Kp60 / 4Kp30 / HDp60 cameras looking for a future proof monitor-recorder. HDR now comes free across the Atomos 4K Line-up Timed with the release of the Ninja Inferno, Atomos have driven down the price of the existing line-up, passing on the volume savings they receive due to the popularity of the entire HDR range. The Shogun Flame and Ninja Flame are now $995 and $795 respectively (both models ship with mains power supply, recording caddy & travel case. The Shogun Flame also ships with an XLR breakout cable). To complement all models in the line-up, Atomos have developed a tailored Accessory Kit and Power Kit that arm users with everything needed to power, control, dock, charge and safely carry the units at an amazing price. The flagship Shogun Inferno continues to ship as is today. Product New Price (MSRP $US ex tax) Shogun Flame $995 ($1695 saving of $700) Ninja Inferno $995 Ninja Flame $795 ($1295 saving of $500) Accessory Kit $295 Power Kit $149 Share Tweet Comment Your Comments Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

 Apple totally dissed WikiLeaks this week — here's why Kif Leswing Mar. 26, 2017, 10:30 AM 21,404 facebook linkedin twitter email print WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. Reuters/Peter Nicholls Julian Assange's website WikiLeaks is in possession of what appears to be CIA hacking tools that can target popular computers like Apple's iPhones and Macs as well as products from other big tech companies like Microsoft and Google.  Assange has said that WikiLeaks will share details of the vulnerabilities with Apple and other big tech companies, so they can fix the vulnerabilities that the CIA uses for its hacking tools. "We have decided to work with them to give them some exclusive access to the additional technical details that we have so that fixes can be developed and pushed out," Assange said in a press conference earlier this month. But Apple didn't sound very grateful to Assange for his "exclusive" offer. In fact, Apple's public response to WikiLeaks was downright frosty. "We have not negotiated with Wikileaks for any information," said Apple in a statement provided to Business Insider on Thursday. The statement said that WikiLeaks was just like anyone else, despite its stolen CIA files: It could submit bugs through a standard process, and that while they may have been briefly in touch, Apple hasn't seen anything that hasn't been tweeted or posted to the WikiLeaks website.  "We have given them instructions to submit any information they wish through our normal process under our standard terms," according to the statement. "Thus far, we have not received any information from them that isn’t in the public domain." Then, to top it off, Apple says that WikiLeaks, with its public threat to release ways to attack Apple and other tech companies' products after 90 days if bugs are not "fixed,"  is actively working to harm iPhone users: "We are tireless defenders of our users' security and privacy, but we do not condone theft or coordinate with those that threaten to harm our users." There's no other way to read this as anything but an unconditional slam on Julian Assange, and essentially, a promise that Apple will not work with him or WikiLeaks. Apple is not happy with WikiLeaks at all.  Why this matters  USA What hackers like those that work for the CIA need to really control someone's phone or computer is what's called a "zero-day" vulnerability. Zero-days are basically secret bugs that can be used by professionals to break software and gain access to a system. But one problem for the CIA and other hackers is that zero-days expire: as soon as they're known, the tech companies fix the bug, making the exploit useless. Apple, in particular, kills vulnerabilities all the time, and said all the bugs mentioned in the WikiLeaks files so far have already been patched. (Google and Microsoft are also equally good at squashing zero-days — maybe even better than Apple.) The documents that WikiLeaks is publishing are not code or instructions to recreate an exploit, but strongly suggest that the CIA had an arsenal of zero-days at some point — and if any organization can be expected to have a library of zero-day vulnerabilities, it's the CIA.  This doesn't just affect Apple: So far, WikiLeaks has dumped two batches of documents from the CIA. The one released earlier this week included details on old Mac and iPhone exploits. The first batch mentioned alleged vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows and Google Android as well — all patched so far, according to the companies. But WikiLeaks says they have more files they haven't shown the public yet. Microsoft said in a statement to Business Insider that all the vulnerabilities mentioned in the first WikiLeaks batch have been fixed: "Our investigation confirmed that the information released on March 7 is dated, and the disclosed issues are already addressed in modern systems." Google said that security updates "already shield users from many of these alleged vulnerabilities." Google, Microsoft, and Apple have encouraged their users to update their software.  Drip drip drip FILE PHOTO: Logo of the Wikileaks website is pictured on a smartphone in Tokyo Thomson Reuters The way WikiLeaks is dripping its leaks out in batches leaves companies like Apple, Google, and Microsoft in a tricky position. These companies can't really confirm without the code whether the zero-days are legitimate or not. (All they really have is descriptions of the exploits.) But it also can't wholly dismiss the leaks — or even future leaks — in case some do end up being live exploits.  For example, since the vulnerabilities are described in top secret confidential files, it could be legally dangerous for a company like Apple or Microsoft to talk to Assange and WikiLeaks to see purported tools and files that haven't been made public yet, the Financial Times reported.  So companies need to be careful about how they're talking to Assange. "WikiLeaks made initial contact via secure@microsoft.com and we have followed up, treating them as we would any other finder," a Microsoft spokeperson told Business Insider.  Essentially, tech companies can't treat WikiLeaks differently than any other bug finder.  Making it more difficult is that WikiLeaks seems to be misrepresenting the content of the dumps in its widely-viewed announcements, spurring knee-jerk and potentially misleading news coverage, security experts who evaluated the contents of the dump previously told Business Insider. A file labeled "iOS Team Projects and Tools and Vulnerabilities/Exploits" WikiLeaks WikiLeaks never mentions in its announcement how old any of the various files are, for example. And WikiLeaks uses grandiose language, declaring that the CIA has "lost control of the majority of its hacking arsenal." Plus, by releasing the leaked files bit-by-bit, WikiLeaks is making it nearly impossible for a big tech company to say that all the problems in the leak have been fixed — what if Assange is sitting on a doozy of a bug?  It doesn't look that way — so far, the security community has been laughing at how old and outdated many of the documents published by WikiLeaks have been.  I wonder if Wikileaks has 0days for any other recent devices, like the Vax 11/780 or my Atari 2600. — Matthew Green (@matthew_d_green) March 24, 2017 Not an ally Tim Cook, Apple CEO REUTERS/Rick Wilking Speaking privately, tech companies and their lawyers do not see Assange as a defender, as he has been described in the New York Times. Tech companies aren't particularly upset at the CIA for finding vulnerabilities in their products, pointing out that most people expect the CIA to develop vulnerabilities — spying is kind of the agency's purpose — and that the targeted attacks described in the WikiLeaks files are preferable to the mass remote surveillance described in the NSA files leaked by Edward Snowden.  But Assange is not Snowden, and his CIA leaks have not been received warmly in the tech industry. Ultimately, he puts tech companies in a bad position.  Apple's claim that it has "fixed" all "vulnerabilities" described in DARKMATTER is duplicitous. EFI is a systemic problem, not a zero-day. — WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) March 24, 2017 Obviously companies like Apple and Microsoft want to patch any possible vulnerabilities as soon as possible, but the way Assange is releasing the CIA files puts them in a terrible position: there's not enough to go on, it's possibly illegal to obtain more details, and WikiLeaks is withholding information. So as Assange continues to publish bits and pieces of his trove of files, expect big tech companies to go through a predictable dance: First the files will appear online, and about 24 hours later, you'll hear that security researchers have found that the files are already old news.  SEE ALSO: How to use the app that Apple just bought and made free for everyone More: Apple Wikileaks 0-days Security Hacking Julian Assange facebook linkedin twitter email print × Recommended For You Powered by Sailthru Apple totally dissed WikiLeaks this week — here's why Apple totally dissed WikiLeaks this week — here's why Julian Assange's website WikiLeaks is in...

Now, Apple Music executives Jimmy Iovine, Robert Kondrk, and Zane Lowe have sat down with The Verge to offer up more details on Apple’s work with Drake, as well as Beats 1 as a whole. Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case In its first week of availability on Apple Music, Drake’s “More Life” project was streamed 300 million times. That bests Drake’s previous album, “Views,” which also happened to be an Apple Music exclusive. “More Life,” however, was not an Apple Music exclusive, making it all the more notable that the project out-performed Views. Apple attributes the strong performance of Drake’s work on Apple Music to Beats 1. Apple VP of apps and content Robert Kondrk and Apple Music head of content Larry Jackson explained to The Verge that Beats 1 has basically replaced SoundCloud for Drake. The rapper has gone from releasing singles through SoundCloud to debuting them through his weekly Beats 1 show, “OVO Sound Radio.” Jackson says that Drake very much took a chance on Apple Music. “We weren’t a proven hit, we weren’t a proven entity at all, whatsoever,” he explained. Jimmy Iovine added that Apple has worked to build Beats 1 around what Drake wants and needs: “We learned so much from just building what Drake needed,” Iovine added. “He had the idea, we kind of just built and supported around him, and we’ve learned a lot from that, and the entire industry has learned a lot from that.” The Apple Music executives also offered up some information on Beats 1’s scope and reach. Iovine explained that the numbers he saw on Drake’s radio show were “TV numbers,” noting last weekend’s episode where “More Life” was debuted marked the most listened to Beats 1 show to date. Furthermore, Larry Jackson stated that Beats 1 is the “biggest radio station in the world.” Jackson’s comment is notable as many have questioned the success of the always-on Beats 1 streaming platform as Apple has been reluctant to provide concrete listener data. “It’s the biggest radio station in the world. There’s no way you’re going to find another station that has as many concurrent listeners and audience-wise as Beats 1, period,” Jackson said. The full piece can be read on The Verge. The success of Beats 1 in streaming exclusive content is interesting and could potentially mark a different way for Apple to handle all of its exclusive content deals in the future, if it indeed is betting big on Beats 1.

Nathan Ingraham, @nateingraham 03.22.17 in Personal Computing Comments 1260 Shares Share Tweet Share Save Apple Apple has been trying to reverse declining iPad sales for several years now, without much success. For the past year and a half, that strategy could be summed up in one word: more. More power, more screen real estate, more accessories. Of course, the iPad Pro also cost more money, so it didn't help reverse waning interest in Apple's tablets. Now Apple is going in the opposite direction. The newest iPad, announced yesterday with little fanfare, is most notable for its affordable price. The 9.7-inch tablet starts at only $329 with 32GB of storage; you can get a spacious 128GB model for $100 more. It replaces the aging iPad Air 2 in Apple's lineup -- but despite the updated processor on the inside, the new tablet makes a number of compromises to hit that low price. But Apple seems to think it's found the right balance of specs and price to get more people to turn the iPad's fortunes around. Despite the fact that the rumor mill indicated a late March event with big updates to the iPad Pro, the new iPad was just one of several announcements Apple made yesterday. New red iPhones, new Watch bands and this new iPad all felt like they would have been good lead-ups to a big new product reveal -- but without that, it seems Apple just decided to push everything out in a series of low-key press releases. Even with this muted introduction, the new iPad says a lot about the company's intentions in the tablet market. It's an admission that Apple needs a true budget-priced iPad with the most popular screen and newer hardware than the aging iPad Air 2 offered. The addition of the A9 chip should give the new iPad enough horsepower to work well for several years, even if the processor is already more than a year old. But the big corner that Apple cut to hit this aggressive price point is the screen. The new iPad's display is a step backward from the Air 2. It's not laminated to the glass touch surface and it lacks antireflective coating, two characteristics that were included in the Air 2 as well as the existing iPad Pro. What this means is you'll see a small but noticeable air gap between the glass and display, something that diminishes the effect of actually touching on-screen elements. It's a most unfortunate change, but it's classic Apple: If you want the best hardware, you're going to have to put up the cash and get the Pro. Still, it's surprising to see Apple take a step back in display technology, especially considering how crucial the screen is to the entire iPad experience. This thing is basically a window to the internet, and Apple compromised that window. In a less crucial change, Apple actually made the new iPad slightly thicker and heavier than the Air 2. Now it has the same dimensions as the original iPad Air from 2013 -- but that's not something to worry about. As someone who's used that tablet for more than three years, it's certainly not a heavy or unwieldy device. If these larger dimensions helped Apple get the price down, it's a trade worth making. Apple is betting that these differences aren't going to matter to buyers -- and to some respect, I agree with that logic. If you have an iPad older than the Air 2, this new model will likely represent a major upgrade (we'll have to wait until we test it to pass final judgement, of course). Unless you have an original Air, the form factor will be an immediate improvement, and the A9 chip simply smokes the older models. And you'll be able to get that upgrade for significantly less money now than ever before. With this new model, Apple has also finally cleaned up the mess it made of its iPad lineup. Most potential buyers will pick between the new iPad and the single iPad Mini that Apple now offers. The new iPad is now the cheapest iPad you can buy, not coincidentally in its most popular screen size. And if you need more power or a bigger display or want to use Apple's accessories, the Pro lineup is waiting for you. The jury is still out on whether or not this will actually turn iPad sales around. New hardware at a lower price is potentially the kind of thing that can get people interested, but the relatively quick rise and fall of iPad sales might indicate that this isn't a growth category right now, full stop. Apple only sold 13.1 million iPads in the most recent holiday quarter (only about half of the 26 million it sold during the holiday season in 2013), and I don't know if this new device is enough to turn around that decline. Apple has often cited high customer satisfaction rates for the iPad, and the upgrade cycle is clearly longer than the two years we see for smartphones. So Apple's new, cheap iPad might be what it needs to get the many people who bought iPads three or four years ago to upgrade. But even if this latest tactic moves the needle, it seems unlikely that sales will get back to that 2013 peak anytime soon. Apple calls the iPad "the future of personal computing," but it's a future that everyone is still not on board with.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Software iOS 10.3 Beta Code Hints Support For 10.5-inch iPad With Faster Refresh Rates By Ali Salman Mar 22, 2017 12Shares Share Tweet Submit iOS 10.3 is currently a work-in-progress and rests in the beta phase. While the update packs quite a handful of forward-facing features for the consumers, there’s a lot that is still unknown. Seemingly, Apple might have accidentally teased support for an upcoming 10.5-inch iPad in the particular update. Steve Troughton-Smith discovered the code in iOS 10.3 beta. He tweeted that the refresh rate of a 2017 iOS device could go higher than 60Hz. Let’s see some more details on the subject. iOS 10.3 Code Hints At A New 10.5-inch iPad With Faster Display Rates One thing to note here is that Steve did not specifically mention the 10.5-inch iPad here. However, a recently published report seems to confirm the existence of the device. The code mentions details of how Apple will allow developers to run their apps in different refresh rates. It can potentially be true that the company is looking to revamp the iPad lineup. However, the news is not official yet, so be advised to take it with a pinch of salt. Related Apple’s 10.5 Inch iPad Pro Enters Limited Production; Don’t Expect An Early Launch States Source Currently, Apple already has two iPad Pro models, the 9.7-inch variant and the 12.9-inch iPad Pro. If Apple were to announce the 10.5-inch iPad, it would possibly add to the Pro lineup. Altogether, the company would have three iPad Pro models. Nonetheless, it depends on the company where it sees fit. I remain reasonably convinced that an iOS device screen refresh rate higher than 60Hz is possible this year pic.twitter.com/k9W4q8rxcm — Steve T-S (@stroughtonsmith) March 22, 2017 Advertisement Apart from this, the iPad already supports Apple Pencil input at 240 hertz which is faster than the screen update speed. At this point, it was bound to happen that Apple would eventually up the screen refresh rates to allow for a more responsive drawing while minimizing lag. Related Attackers Launched a Safari Scareware Campaign to Extort Users Watching Porn Could the forthcoming 10.5-inch iPad be a high-end yet low-cost iPad just as the company introduced one yesterday? More importantly, however it may arrive, it will sure be interesting to see where Apple fits it. There is a difference between the 9.7-inch iPad and the 9.7-inch iPad Pro and probably the upcoming iPad would feature new additions which would set it apart from the rest. Apart from the iPad alone, Apple also unveiled a red iPhone 7 yesterday as part of its (PRODUCT)RED campaign. Moreover, the storage capacity of both the iPad mini 4 and iPhone SE were increased as well. Finally, there were some new case color options for the iPhone, new Apple Watch bands and a new Clips app for creating videos. Be sure to check our extensive coverage of the announcements.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Security Apple Won’t Pay Ransom & Denies Any Breaches, But Hackers Could Still Go Through With Mass iPhone Resets By Rafia Shaikh Mar 23, 2017 10Shares Share Tweet Submit Apple shying away from asking users to reset password. Easy fix? change your passwords anyway. After staying silent for a few days, Apple has finally responded to claims of a hacker group that says it has access to over 600 million iCloud accounts. Earlier this week, a Motherboard story reported that a group of hackers calling itself the “Turkish Crime Family” had gained access to over millions of iCloud and other Apple accounts. The group warned that they would remotely wipe the victims’ devices if Apple refused to pay a $75,000 ransom price. The group had later said the ransom price was $150,000. As the original report had noted, there appeared to be several inconsistencies in the claims of this group, however, they may really have access to some data. Related Hackers Threaten Apple to Remotely Wipe Millions of iPhones If the Company Doesn’t Pay Ransom After the first story went live, Turkish Crime Family contacted Wccftech showing screenshots of their communication with Apple. The group also claimed that the inconsistencies were due “one of” their media members that is no longer working with the group due to “inaccuracy and lack of professionalism.” No Apple hack, but LinkedIn or Yahoo data could come back to bite us Many feared that Apple’s no-response policy would put users at risk if they won’t get any official email to reset their passwords. Thankfully, the Cupertino tech giant has finally spoken, clarifying that there have not been any breaches of its systems and that user data is safe. However, there remains a possibility of this group having access to this data through some other source, not due to a breach of Apple systems. In a statement to Fortune, Apple said: “There have not been any breaches in any of Apple’s systems including iCloud and Apple ID,” the spokesperson said. “The alleged list of email addresses and passwords appears to have been obtained from previously compromised third-party services.” While Apple has denied that its systems suffered any breach, they do seem to have validated the details of this claim as the company said the data appears to have been obtained from other “third-party services.” Related Hackers Lock Down Hotel Rooms, Pushing a Luxury Resort to Go Back in the “Time of Great-Grandfathers” Ahead of Apple’s statement, while talking to Wccftech, security expert Chris Vickery had also noted that “there’s a good chance that […] this group really has only been breaching Apple fan forums. If you have a site for Apple enthusiasts, and a forum on that site, it’s likely that many forum users will re-use the same password from their iCloud accounts.” “When the enthusiast forum is breached, the attackers will try the forum passwords on iCloud,” Vickery added. Then there’s a possibility that hackers are using passwords that were previously dumped after massive breaches that sites like Yahoo, LinkedIn and others suffered over the years and the data was mostly dumped in 2016. Since many users reuse their passwords, it would still be possible for the group to carry out their threats. Advertisement In an email to Wccftech, the Turkish Crime Family noted their “increasing” processing power that will help them carry out mass resets. “From our calculations if everything goes to plan we’ll have enough power to factory reset 150 accounts per minute per script, Our server strength can currently handle 17 scripts per server, 150 x 17 = 2550 accounts factory reset per minute per server 2550 x 250 servers = 637500 accounts per minute 637500 x 60 minutes = 38250000 million accounts reset per hour Update: We are still strengthening our infrastructure for the attack, we now have more people getting involved with us day by day that are providing us with more databases for the attack which will be on 7 April 2017.” They also claimed that the number of user accounts they have gained access to “has been bumped up from 519 million to 627 to then 717 million,” thanks to other hackers joining them. “We’re assured that this number will carry on growing until the day of attack,” they wrote. Why wouldn’t Apple go for a reset? As it’s clear that the group does have at least a small fraction of data that is legitimate, why is Apple not asking customers to reset their passwords? Considering the possibility of this threat, Apple said the company “is actively monitoring to prevent unauthorized access to user accounts,” and is also “working with law enforcement to identify the criminals involved.” This means the company wouldn’t (and shouldn’t) pay the ransom and is hoping to catch the criminals before they do anything. However, what if more groups have access to this data? What if someone else uses it in the future? Wouldn’t it be wiser if Apple would just ask its customers to reset their passwords? “To protect against these type of attacks, we always recommend that users always use strong passwords, not use those same passwords across sites and turn on two-factor authentication,” Apple added. Good suggestion, but how many Apple users are going to read this statement and follow this “recommendation.” As a user, all you can do is to change your password and save yourself from being caught in between hackers and tech companies. Whatever happens (or doesn’t) on April 7, if you are someone who tends to reuse passwords, better to do a simple password reset. And while we are at it, don’t forget to activate two-factor authentication, too.

As we’ve recently seen from leaked CIA documents, no one is immune to hacking attacks. Here’s how to protect yourself against them, whether they come from opportunist thieves or state-sponsored spies. 1. Keep up to date – and don’t open up holes yourself When it comes to protecting yourself against hackers, step one is always to install software updates as soon as they become available: that’s as true on smartphones as it is on computers. Yes, updating can be a tiresome and intrusive process, and it sometimes brings annoying changes to the interface that you’re used to. All the same, a huge proportion of successful hacks exploit vulnerabilities that have already been patched; exposing yourself unnecessarily is just daft. Popular Searches Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▲ 856.14 +9.12 +1.08% General Motors Co GM ▲ 35.51 +0.80 +2.30% Apple Inc AAPL ▲ 143.91 +3.03 +2.15% Tencent Holdings Ltd TCTZF ▲ 29.62 +0.45 +1.53% I’d also strongly advise against using unofficial tools to “root” your phone (known as “jailbreaking” on iOS), unless you know exactly what you’re doing. On a rooted phone, technical safeguards can be defeated, allowing apps to perform all sorts of actions that are normally prohibited – and that can include snooping on your personal data. 2. Be careful of what you install When you install a smartphone app, you may be asked to grant it various permissions, including the ability to read your files, access your camera or listen in to your microphone. There are legitimate uses for these capabilities, but they’re potentially open to abuse: think before you approve the request. That applies especially to Android users, as Google’s app-vetting process isn’t as strict as Apple’s, and there have been reports of malicious apps spending months on the Play Store before being spotted and taken down. Android also lets you install apps from third-party sources: this allows services such as Amazon’s competing Appstore to operate, but it also provides an easy way for rogue apps to get onto your phone. I’d strongly advise against installing anything from an unfamiliar website. 3. Review what’s already on your phone Even if the apps on your phone seemed simple and safe when you installed them, subsequent updates could have turned them into something more sinister. Take two minutes to review all the apps on your smartphone, and see which permissions they’re using: on iOS, you’ll find lots of relevant information under Settings > Privacy. On Android, it’s harder to get an overview of which apps have which permissions, but there are plenty of security apps that help here, including free packages from Avast and McAfee. These tools can also jump in and alert you if you’re trying to install an app that’s known to be malicious, and warn you if a “phishing” attack is trying to trick you into entering a password into an untrusted app or webpage. 4. Make it hard for intruders to get in If a thief gets physical access to your phone, they can cause all sorts of trouble. For a start, your email app probably contains a trove of personal information. Make sure your phone is locked when not in use: both Android and iOS can be set to require a six-digit passcode. Your device may offer other options too, like fingerprints or facial recognition. Such methods aren’t perfect – a really determined hacker could copy your fingerprints from a drinking glass, or trick a camera with a photograph of you – but they’re a lot better than nothing. And be wary of “smart unlock” features, which automatically unlock your phone when you’re at home, or when your smartwatch is near; these could let a thief bypass your unlock code altogether. 5. Be prepared to track and lock your phone Plan ahead, so even if your phone is stolen, you know your data is safe. One option is to set your phone to automatically erase itself after a certain number of incorrect attempts to enter the passcode. If that seems a bit drastic, don’t forget that both Apple and Google operate “find my device” services that can locate your phone on a map, and remotely lock or erase it. For Apple users, this is accessed through the iCloud website – you can check it’s enabled on the phone in Settings > iCloud > Find My iPhone. Android users can access Google’s service at google.co.uk/android/devicemanager. You can also make a missing phone ring – helpful for drawing attention to the thief, or tracking down a handset that’s been merely mislaid. We all know there's a risk involved in using an open wireless network. But you may not realise how severe it is 6. Don’t leave online services unlocked Auto-login is a very convenient feature, especially since a virtual keyboard can make typing passwords a chore. It’s also a huge liability: an intruder simply needs to open your browser to gain access to all your online accounts. Ideally, therefore, you shouldn’t use auto-login features at all. If you must, use a password manager app that requires you to regularly re-enter a master password. And don’t use the same password for more than one app or service: if that one password gets found out, it can be used to access a whole range of private information. This applies even if you’re perfectly scrupulous about keeping your smartphone secure: hackers regularly break into online services to steal user credentials, which they then try out on other sites. 7. Adopt an alter ego If you’ve followed this advice so far, it should be very difficult for anyone to get into your phone. However, some major hacks have been pulled off without any access to the victim at all. If someone can find out (for example) your date of birth, home town and mother’s maiden name – all stuff that can be easily picked up from a site like Facebook – that’s often all they need to reset a password and start breaking into your accounts. You can see off such attacks by fictionalising your past with details that are unlikely to be guessed; perhaps, for the purposes of security, you were born in 1999 to Mrs Victoria Beckham, née Adams. Just remember what you claimed, or you could end up locking yourself out. 8. Beware open wifi We all know there’s a risk involved in using an open wireless network. But you may not realise how severe it is: anyone in the vicinity can snoop on what you’re doing online. This sort of attack demands specialist software and skills, so it’s unlikely to be a hazard in your local cafe, but it’s not a danger that can be ignored. If you’re at all doubtful about a wireless network, don’t connect – stick with your phone’s mobile internet connection. Or use a VPN tool such as CyberGhost or TunnelBear (both available free for Android and iOS). These tools route your traffic through a private encrypted channel, so even if someone is monitoring your traffic they won’t be able to see what you’re up to. 9. Don’t let lockscreen notifications give the game away Lots of apps pop up messages and notifications on your phone’s lockscreen. It’s worth thinking about what these notifications may reveal. If you work for a big banking company, for example, a visible email from a work colleague or a meeting reminder tells a thief that this might be a particularly interesting phone to steal. On iOS, also consider disabling access to Siri from the lockscreen. Siri isn’t supposed to give away personal information before you enter your passcode to unlock the iPhone, but past hacks have let intruders use Siri to unlock the device, access details of contacts and view photos. It’s safest to shut the feature off entirely: you’ll find the option under Settings > Touch ID & Passcode > Disable Siri on the Lockscreen. 10. Lock individual apps A strong passcode helps keep thieves out of your phone, but what if a stranger snatches your phone while you’re using it? Or asks to borrow it to check a website, then bolts off down the street? On Android, as a second line of defence, you can lock individual apps, so even if someone can get past your lockscreen, they can’t open your email or banking app without a second password. This capability isn’t built into the OS, but there are plenty of free apps that provide it, such as AVG AntiVirus Free. iOS users can’t directly lock individual apps, but check out Folder Lock – free on the App Store – which can password-protect your documents and folders, reducing the amount of information a thief can access. 11. Get a warning when your phone goes walkies If you’re on the fence about investing in a smartwatch, here’s a little-known feature that could swing it: Apple Watch and Android Wear devices can warn you immediately if they lose Bluetooth contact with your phone. If you get this notification while you’re in a public place, there’s a good chance someone’s just picked your pocket, and is currently making off with your phone. The device will normally be less than 50 metres away when the connection drops, so the warning gives you a chance to ring the phone right away, hopefully drawing attention to the thief and prompting them to jettison it. Failing that, you can lock it before the culprit has a chance to start trying to break in and steal your data. 12. Keep an eye on things behind the scenes No matter how cautious you are, you can’t completely eradicate the danger of your phone being hacked – not unless you refuse to install any apps or visit any websites. What you can do is supplement your on-device security measures with an online service. LogDog – available for both Android and iOS – is an app that monitors your identity on sites such as Gmail, Dropbox and Facebook. It alerts you to suspicious activity, such as logins from unfamiliar places, giving you a chance to step in and change your credentials before serious harm can be done. As a bonus, LogDog will also scan your email and highlight messages containing sensitive data such as credit card details and passwords, which you can then purge to ensure they don’t fall into the wrong hands.

The label also says early calculations for More Life have it at around 600 million streams worldwide, which would be a record for an album. Quotes in the article Apple Inc AAPL ▲ 143.82 +2.94 +2.09% After setting a record with 89.9 million streams in its first 24 hours on Apple’s streaming service — over 33 million streams ahead of Ed Sheeran’s Divide on Spotify, which has around 80 million more users — it’s clear Drake and his favorite music service have cracked the streaming formula. So how did Apple manage to break a record with an album that's also available on Spotify, with only 20 million users compared to Spotify’s 100 million? The answer, according to the Apple Music team, is the power of Beats 1 and OVO Sound Radio. For Drake, Beats 1 has essentially replaced SoundCloud, the platform he once dominated and released singles through — a move that Jackson and Apple VP of apps and content Robert Kondrk said was a risk for Drake at the time. “We weren’t a proven hit, we weren’t a proven entity at all, whatsoever,” says Jackson. SoundCloud just got a shoutout from Chance The Rapper at the Grammys, but the service has been having a rough time since Drake left, with Recodereporting it recently had to raise a $70 million debt round just to stay afloat. “Drake and Oliver and Future [The Prince] were the first to do this with us.” Drake has been tied at the hip with Apple Music since it launched in 2015, releasing a series of exclusive songs and albums through the service and on OVO Sound Radio, with his co-manager Oliver El-Khatib serving as the usual host. And More Life debuted on the most recent episode. “What we saw on Drake’s radio show were TV numbers,” says Jimmy Iovine. The episode set the record for the most listened to Beats 1 show to date.  “It’s the biggest radio station in the world. There’s no way you’re going to find another station that has as many concurrent listeners and audience-wise as Beats 1, period,” Larry Jackson, Apple Music’s head of content said. (Apple declined to offer specific listener numbers for Beats 1.) “If you rewind back to July of 2015, and those records that rolled out like ‘Back to Back,’ — ‘Hotline Bling’ debuted on OVO Sound Radio first, ‘Charged Up’ debuted there first — all these records debuted in a space that was really still new and nascent, and [Drake] made it his own. You can glance over it, but we created this idea that was really great for him, and he took advantage of it,” Jackson said. “Drake and Oliver and [Drake’s other co-manager] Future [The Prince] were the first to do this with us.” “He knows what he’s doing, and he knows his audience. And he knows it’s going to work when it’s ready.” We learned so much from just building what Drake needed,” Iovine added. “He had the idea, we kind of just built and supported around him, and we’ve learned a lot from that, and the entire industry has learned a lot from that.” Zane Lowe, the head of Beats 1, noted that Drake doesn’t rush his work, and that has helped him mellow out. “I mean what he’s taught me just in terms of the parameters of broadcasting is remarkable. I remember when we were first waiting for those shows to come in [OVO Sound Radio] and they’d come in 20 minutes late, and I’d be freaking out because we’d run over our start time. Now the show comes in an hour late and we’re all just like cool.” Lowe continued, “He knows what he’s doing, and he knows his audience. And he knows it’s going to work when it’s ready. The best thing that anyone — including myself — can do is get out of the way.” “As Jimmy would put it, we really do give them the keys and let them drive, and Drake has done that,” adds Kondrk. Now an audience which once went to SoundCloud to hear the latest Drake music heads to Beats 1 first. Kondrk describes the relationship between Apple Music and Beats 1 like an amusement park — once you’re inside the Apple Music app to listen to Beats 1, it’s only natural you’ll stay in it to stream the songs afterwards. “The music is debuting through OVO Sound Radio first, no one really ever leaves the amusement park, and that’s why the numbers make sense,” Kondrk says. “It’s a new paradigm that we’ve really created here for someone like him to come in and be a genius and take full advantage of everything we have to offer.”© Provided by The Verge Drake Zane Lowe said that Drake has been able to create cultural moments when he livestreams an album on his show, something that other artists like Future have taken advantage of. “When I hear a record go out like [More Life], I’m transported into the same place that I hope millions of other people are, which is I’m listening to it at the same time and I’m following the reaction on social media, and I’m getting texts from my friends in different parts of the world,” says Lowe. “If you’re going to have an era or moment where you can look back and say that the experience got better, or the music sounded better, or we shifted gears into new technology and made it work, it has to be spearheaded by the artist, always,” Lowe says. “If you look back at any great era, it’s always one or two artists that got it, and embraced it and took it and made it their own, and that’s how they owned that era. Drake has done that, and his camp have done that, and that’s why it’s such an exciting time.” It’s undeniable that Apple Music has been able to capitalize on its ability to debut albums live across the globe, but an additional — and arguably bigger — part of Apple Music’s success with Drake and other artists has been the run of exclusives it has kept up over the past 18 months. Somewhat surprisingly, More Life wasn’t an Apple Music exclusive. “No one really ever leaves the amusement park.” “We didn’t have Drake’s album exclusive, but it was fantastic what worked out,” says Iovine. “We’re just about ideas. Whoever has a great idea we like to follow it and execute it. [Drake] had the idea, we kind of just built and supported around him.” Iovine also said that Apple Music can’t become just a “utility,” noting that the company had to stay nimble, and working with artists like Drake is a key to avoiding that distinction. “We’re always searching for ideas and new ways to do things. I use this word quite often but it’s so true. These [streaming] services cannot be utilities, it’s not enough. They have to be — they almost have to make music a verb — it has to just move. And that’s what we’re trying to do.” Iovine continued, “Two years ago, people would’ve thought we were crazy with what we were doing with Drake. And we are starting things with other people that in two years will look as interesting as this.” Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

This is a particularly important year for Samsung following the travails of the Galaxy Note 7, and the Korean company is currently concentrated on ensuring that the next generation device is considerably more stable than its predecessor. Meanwhile, this will also be a landmark year for Apple, as the consumer electronics giant marks the tenth anniversary of the iPhone series. Before examining what we can expect from the Galaxy Note 8, it is important to emphasize that there is something of a branding issue here. It is not yet known precisely what Apple will call its device releases this year, or even how many iPhone 8 handsets will be released. It is now generally believed that we can expect the Californian corporation to produce three separate handsets during 2017, but how these will ultimately be branded remains to be seen. But for the purpose of this article, the iPhone 8 Plus represents the top of the range iPhone unit, with other possible names for this device being iPhone X, iPhone Edition or just plain old iPhone 8. camera4u / Pixabay Galaxy Note 8, iPhone 8 Plus Display It is believed that the iPhone 8 Plus may feature the largest display of any iPhone release. The device is currently being linked with a 5.8-inch screen, which would be larger than the 5.5-inch display included in the iPhone 7 Plus. it is also probable that Apple will introduce curved screen technology to the iPhone range in 2017, with the iPhone 8 Plus certain to be a recipient of this design parameter. Reports have suggested that Apple will include OLED technology as well for the first time when the iPhone 8 generation hits the stores, with benefits for the iPhone 8 Plus in both screen quality and power consumption. Apple will also probably improve the screen resolution of the iPhone 8 Plus in comparison to previous generations, meaning that quad HD is likely. Samsung must consider how to respond to the iPhone 8 Plus with its display technology, and thus may consider making the Galaxy Note 8 its first ever 4K resolution device. Furthermore, the phablet is expected to feature a large wraparound display, possibly even as large as 6.4 inches. Storage Apple has really set the iPhone aside from other devices in the mobile technology sphere by delivering a huge amount of storage. Considering the edge that the device already has over the Galaxy Note range in this department, it is probable that we will see identical specs in the iPhone 8 Plus to the previous generation. This would mean a maximum integrated storage capacity of 256GB. Samsung may respond by increasing the storage quantity included in the Galaxy Note 8, but the smart money is on the corporation continuing to enable this to be expanded via micro SD technology. This would mean that the storage included in the premium version of the Galaxy Note 8 would remain at 64GB, but this could be expanded up to 256GB. Apple is not expected to embrace micro SD for the iPhone 8 Plus. RAM All mobile devices are reliant on RAM memory to a certain extent, and with Apple increasing the screen size in the iPhone 8 Plus it is likely that is the device will also benefit from a memory boost. This would see the iPhone 8 Plus include 4 GB of memory, putting it on a par with the likely specification for the Galaxy S series. However, Samsung doesn’t have the unique combination of proprietary hardware and software from which Apple benefits, so the Korean company will consider boosting the memory of the Galaxy Note 8 still further. The 4GB included in the Galaxy Note 7 already gave the Samsung device an advantage, but analysts believe that the Galaxy Note 8 will feature 6GB of memory, extending this gap further still. Image Source: iphone8plus.com Camera technology The iPhone 8 Plus has been linked with a 12-megapixel dual-camera featuring an optical image stabilization system and 4K video recording. All manner of advanced camera technology has been floated for the iPhone 8 Plus previously, including a unique periscope design. However, with Apple set to integrate several new features into the next generation phablet, it is more likely that a slightly more conservative approach will prevail. This will be the first generation in while in which there is almost no discernible difference in photographic capabilities between the two devices, with Samsung expected to deliver an extremely similar camera quotient for the Galaxy Note 8. Instead of spec differences, software and hardware innovations will define which one of these two devices takes the better photographs. New features Apple is expected to include an iris scanner in the iPhone 8 Plus, while wireless charging will also be present for the first time. The Cupertino-based company has also placed a significant emphasis on augmented reality technology, and this could be utilized to provide both security and gaming features. Samsung has gambled on virtual reality being a significant player in the mobile marketplace, and thus the Galaxy Note 8 is expected to feature significant collaboration and compatibility with its Gear VR headset. Pricing Samsung has been able to deliver devices at more affordable price points in recent generations, and this is likely to continue in 2017. Already the iPhone 8 is being linked with a price tag in excess of $1000 in the United States. It is not yet known whether this will apply to the more affordable versions released by the Californian corporation, or whether this refers to the premium iPhone 8 Plus. But one should certainly expect to pay a four-figure sum for the most advanced handset in this range. Considering the drama and disaster of the Galaxy Note 7, Samsung is almost obliged to undercut Apple with the price tag of the Galaxy Note 8, meaning that this device could retail at around $900.

Blue Sky Innovation Technology The CIA may have hacked iPhones and Macs before they even got to customers iPhone 3G Sang Tan / Associated Press A looks at an Apple iPhone 3G in 2008. WikiLeaks says the CIA was able to hack the devices. A looks at an Apple iPhone 3G in 2008. WikiLeaks says the CIA was able to hack the devices. (Sang Tan / Associated Press) Hayley TsukayamaThe Washington Post WikiLeaks claimed Thursday that the CIA had found a way to intercept and hack into Apple iPhones just a year after the company's smartphone hit the market. The group also claimed that the CIA was able to infect Mac computers. But it's very unlikely that your iPhone or Mac was affected, experts say. Apple said that its preliminary assessment of the WikiLeaks documents show that the "alleged iPhone vulnerability affected iPhone 3G only and was fixed in 2009 when iPhone 3GS was released." The company also said that the alleged Mac exploits described by WikiLeaks were fixed in all Macs launched after 2013. The CIA referred The Post to an earlier statement that declined to comment on the accuracy of the WikiLeaks information, but denounced disclosures "designed to damage the Intelligence Community's ability to protect America against terrorists and other adversaries." The documents offer a rare glimpse into the world of modern espionage, said Jeff Pollard, a security and risk analyst at Forrester Research. For Apple and other companies, he said, it also shows that it's very difficult to secure their products all the way from their factories to their customers. WikiLeaks' offer to help tech companies with CIA software holes could be mixed blessing Anick Jesdanun and Michael Liedtke WikiLeaks has offered to help the likes of Google and Apple identify the software holes used by purported CIA hacking tools — and that puts the tech industry in something of a bind. While companies have both a responsibility and financial incentive to fix problems in their software, accepting help... WikiLeaks has offered to help the likes of Google and Apple identify the software holes used by purported CIA hacking tools — and that puts the tech industry in something of a bind. While companies have both a responsibility and financial incentive to fix problems in their software, accepting help... (Anick Jesdanun and Michael Liedtke) "The most concerning part of this is that it highlights that it doesn't matter how secure you keep a device," he said. "You have to understand that there could also be something that gets delivered to you in a device that you purchased." According to WikiLeaks, the documents allege that, as far back as 2008, the CIA was able to install software on iPhones before they were shipped to their intended owners. There's no evidence of tampering done at Apple's factories, experts said. The documents also purportedly show that the CIA found a way to install software on Macs that could not be removed, even if a user were to reinstall their operating system. There is a specific mention of the CIA trying to intercept a laptop that it knew was being given to someone as a gift to plant its malware. Both methods require physical access to the devices. There is no evidence in the documents that the CIA used these methods on a broad scale. Experts who examined the documents said there is little chance that the average consumer — particularly in the United States, given the CIA's foreign focus — would have been affected by these attacks, said Will Strafach, a noted iPhone security expert and co-founder of Verify.ly, a mobile app intelligence service. It's also unlikely that anyone could look at these documents now and design a similar hack, he said. "It's too old. And even if it wasn't too old, it requires you to get to a device that is en route to somebody specific," he said. The release of these documents follow a similar disclosure from WikiLeaks earlier this month, which allegedly outlined a suite of hacking tools used by the CIA that target smartphones, cars and televisions. The group has said that it will work with technology companies to help patch flaws exploited by the CIA's hacking tools, but offered few details on how such a partnership would work, Reuters reported. Apple said that it has not "negotiated with WikiLeaks for any information" and has instructed the organization to submit information though its normal processes. "Thus far, we have not received any information from them that isn't in the public domain," the company's statement said. "We are tireless defenders of our users' security and privacy, but we do not condone theft or coordinate with those that threaten to harm our users."

The 6 most expensive products Apple has ever sold Nick Vega Mar. 26, 2017, 9:00 AM 86,661 facebook linkedin twitter email print Ted Thai/The LIFE Picture Collection/Getty Images Apple has always been known for its steep prices. From phones to computers, tablets to cases, if it’s coming from Apple, it will probably be one of the priciest options available. This reputation for being expensive has spawned a nickname that has become popular with critics of the company: “Apple tax.” The thinking went that customers were willing to pay more to have the famous Apple logo adorn their products. Recently, however, we have reported that Apple seems to be backing away from its expensive image — offering its Apple Watch and AirPods at competitive prices that won't break the bank. The tech giant’s latest move came on Tuesday, when it announced that its new standard iPad would cost only $329 — which is remarkable considering the original iPad cost $499 when it was released in 2010. This might truly mark the beginning of a new era for Apple, so we thought it would be fitting to look back on some of the most expensive products that the company has ever offered. View As: One Page Slides Apple LISA (1985) — $9,995 Flickr/Frank Fujimoto If you saw Aaron Sorkin's 2015 biopic "Steve Jobs," you'll likely remember the Apple LISA. Jobs, played by Michael Fassbender, spends most of the movie saying the computer wasn't named after his daughter Lisa, until he finally admits it was.  What the movie doesn't spend too much time on is the fact that the LISA cost a whopping $9,995 in 1985. For those keeping score at home, that means the LISA would cost just over $24,000 today, after inflation.   For that price, buyers in 1985 were getting a true technical pioneer — the LISA was the first mouse-operated computer to have a graphical user interface system.  Twentieth Anniversary Macintosh (1997) — $7,499 Photos courtesy of Portfolio/Penguin, publisher of JONY IVE, The Genius Behind Apple's Greatest Products The Twentieth Anniversary Macintosh — or TAM, as those in the know called it — was a truly unique piece of technology. It was released in March 1997, but despite not fitting into any Apple product line, it was the prehistoric ancestor of the modern-day iMac, with all the components held in a slim body behind the screen.  What set it apart from the pack was that it was significantly more expensive than any other Apple offering at the time. The TAM could be had for $7,500, which would be about $11,200 today.  However, in a little less than a year, the price got slashed to $1,995 to clear stock. When the TAM was finally sold out, it was discontinued.  Macintosh Portable (1989) — $7,300 eBay In September 1989, Apple unveiled its first "portable" computer. I put "portable" in quotes because although the computer wasn't connected to the wall by a cord, it still weighed a back-breaking 16 lbs — the same as an enormous bowling ball. For the privilege of being able to lug around this machine, the company asked only that you write them a check for $7,300 — about $14,300 today.    Apple LaserWriter (1985) — $6,995 Flickr/Cassandra.Jo The draw of the Apple LaserWriter was that it could be shared by over a dozen Macintosh computers. This ability made the $7,000 price tag — nearly $16,000 today — a bit easier to swallow for businesses that ran on Macintosh.  The LaserWriter was one of the very first laser printers available on the mass-market, and it helped usher in the desktop publishing revolution.  Still, though, that's a really expensive printer.    Apple Watch Edition (2015) — $17,000 Apple The Apple Watch hit stores in 2015 with the somewhat-reasonable price of $349 for the baseline model. Watch collectors, however, are not usually known for paying somewhat-reasonable prices for things. You see, a nice watch is as much a statement piece as it is a time-telling device.  Apple was more than happy to scratch that itch for collectors, announcing a version of the Apple Watch, called "Edition." The price started at $10,000 for a watch with rose gold casing, and went as high as $17,000 for one that came with an 18-karat yellow or rose gold case and clasps.  It soon became apparent to Apple that most people — other than Beyonce — had no interest in a smartwatch that cost as much as a car. By the time the Apple Watch Series 2 rolled around last September, the Apple Watch Edition was being marketed as a fitness device rather than a style piece, and topped out at $1,300.  Souped-up Mac Pro (2013) — $20,934.45 Apple This technically isn't a tremendously expensive product, as the bill only surpassed $20,000 after we upgraded every possible internal and added every accessory Apple suggested to our cart, but the final price for a high-end Apple desktop today is staggering nonetheless.  SEE ALSO: This iPhone 8 concept design is the best we've seen yet — check it out More: Features Apple Apple Watch Apple Watch Series 2 Apple LISA Macintosh Mac Pro Luxury Brands Luxury expensive Apple products facebook linkedin twitter email print × Recommended For You Powered by Sailthru The 6 most expensive products Apple has ever sold The 6 most expensive products Apple has ever sold Apple has always been known for its steep...

This week we discuss our battery test once again, fingerprint sensors and why we don't have more scores on the site. Webster: Hi, I like your site for comparing phones, but would it be possible for you guys to list an IR blaster as a feature? This is one of the major points I look at when choosing a phone. Hi, Webster. We are, in fact listing IR ports in our specs database - if you look at a phone that has it like the Xiaomi Mi 5s Plus, youll see a line for that. However, since its a rather niche feature we chose to omit the row entirely for phones that dont have it so as to keep the length of the table under control. Wasym: I like the fact that your reviews are very detailed but when it comes to comparing real life performance of cameras of smartphones, the compare tool is not a very good option because it requires a lot of technical know-how for any person to actually be able to spot a difference in two cameras. Is it not a very good idea that you develop a rating system for cameras, rating cameras on a scale of 1-100, like DxOmark? Thank you for your input, Wasym, its much appreciated. First to address the photo and video compare tools - we dont really think theres a certain level of proficiency required to use the tool. You dont need to be a pro photographer and be able to analyze all the technical aspects of every shot to take advantage of it - its meant to let everyone do their own comparisons. If you dont see any major difference between certain phones thats perfectly fine and chances are youll be equally happy with their real life output as well. After all if you dont care about a minute amount of extra noise in the test setups, chances are they wont bother you when you get a phone and start shooting with it. Now to move on to the oft-requested rating for cameras (or phones as a whole). The goal of this website is to help you, our readers, find the best phone for your specific use cases and budgets. Unfortunately, its never a one-size-fits-all kind of deal and having an auditorium of over 3 million people from all around the world each day its impossible to deliver a rating system that will work for everyone - heck, its impossible to find one that will work for even half the people. Some want to see their photos colorful and detailed and dont mind some extra noise. Others want a more pro-subtle post-processing as the artifacts that come with boosting color saturation and applying excessive sharpening really bother them. Some only shoot photos of buildings and landscapes when traveling so they dont really care about the autofocus speed, but those snapping shots of their fast-moving children know its more important than anything else as even the best shot can be ruined if the focus is in the wrong place. The list of priorities for a phone in general and its camera in particular is something strongly individual so each aspect of its performance carries different weight to different people. Thats why producing a final rating will only serve to start fan wars and wont be of real help to most people - in fact it will be misleading to them. And we really rather offer an incomplete service than a potentially harmful one. Satyam: Can you do a comparison between chipsets like Snapdragon, Apple and Samsung Exynos? Doing a comparison of the Apple chips and the likes of Qualcomm and Samsung is not a good idea (or at all possible) for two reasons. First, comparing benchmarks across platforms is bound to tilt the playing field as software runs different on iOS and Android. Secondly, even if we did manage to find a way to put together a meaningful comparison of Apples chipsets against their Android rivals, it wouldnt be of use to anyone, but forum trolls. You see chipsets dont exist in isolation - you cant order a Galaxy smartphone with the Apple A10 chipset, nor can you get an iPhone with the latest Exynos. So even if you did know which one is more powerful you wouldnt be able to do anything about it. So the only thing that can be of use is comparing the new Apple chips to their predecessors so you know how much extra oomph the latest iPhone is bringing and we are already doing that. Things are different with Android devices as theres plenty of diversity there - both in terms of manufacturers and chipset makers. And as luck would have it, we just did a pretty detailed overview of the available options there - head this way to read it. Abaid: I bought the Galaxy Note7 last year and we all know what happened. Now I am planning to get the Galaxy S8. I consider waiting for 3 months after the release, just to be on safe side, or going for the G6 as I heard it is using heat pipe to reduce battery temperature. Any suggestions from you guys? Did Samsung do anything with the Galaxy S8 to prevent a Note7-like issue? First, the Note7 drama unfolded in about a month so waiting three months to see if it doesnt repeat itself seems a bit excessive. In the aftermath of the recall Samsung explained in detail all the measures it has taken to prevent it from happening again, including 8 additional quality tests. The companys battery division also committed to a $128M investment to boost the safety of its products - so a repeat fiasco is really unlikely. That said, going for the LG G6 is also a viable option. Not because of its heat pipes, which are fairly common in modern flagships, or due to some inevitable Galaxy S8 implosion, but simply because it is a pretty good phone. Ali: Hello! I am looking to buy a mid-range phone and there are some great options but, if leaks are to be believed, the snapdragon 660 and Helio X30 devices are on the horizon. Can you explain what will be the performance and efficiency difference between current crop of SoC and next generation 14nm and 10nm SoCs? Thank you! If you are in the market for a new phone now, you probably shouldnt be concerned about Helio X30 and the Snapdragon 660. The new MediaTek X30 chipset is unlikely to be available in any device before July at the very earliest and even if it makes that optimistic goal it will not reach the mid-range for at least another few months. As for the S660 - it isnt even official yet so we might not see anything with it this year. In fact we are only now getting the first Snapdragon 653 devices so it will take quite a long wait for those two. Furthermore there are already plenty of 14nm mid-range chipsets - Snapdragon 625, Snapdragon 626 plus the Samsung Exynos 7870 and 7880. The MediaTek Helio P20 and P25 are built on 16nm and so are the Huawei Kirin 650, 655 and 658. Minimization of the production process allows for proportionally higher power-efficiency as the elements are smaller and require less power to operate. Mind you, the better power-efficiency doesnt necessary yield better battery life - the manufacturer can instead choose to up the clock speed and transfer some or all of the gains to a higher clock speed, while maintaining the original power consumption. The thing is the jump from 14nm to 10nm isnt nearly as big as the one from 28nm to 14nm so we arent looking at another huge jump, but merely a nice evolution step. So evaluating the potential reward versus the waiting required its probably not worth it and you might go for whatever is available right now. Jaison007: Which is the best location for the fingerprint sensor on a phone? In the front or at the back? Where does GSMArena prefer it to be? Hi Jaison, there are actually not two, but three different positions for the fingerprint sensor - Sony likes to put it on the side of its phones. And each of the locations has its pros and cons that well try and sum up here. A fingerprint on the front means you can unlock the phone when it laying beside you on a table without picking it up. Its also easier to reach for some people depending on the size of the phone and the specific manner in which you hold it. Placing the fingerprint on the back means its easier to hit when you take the phone out of your pocket - it normally falls just under your index finger. Removing it from the front also lets manufacturers remove the home button and trim the bottom bezel. Finally fingerprint swipe gestures (those are still relatively rare) are easier to perform. The obvious downside on the rear-mounted sensor is that you cant use it when the phone is laying on a table or a desk. It can also contribute to thickness or make the design of the back a little too busy if the camera setup is more complex than usual (LG G5 says hi). The fingerprint on the side is always easy to reach and always there no matter if the phone is in your pocket or laying beside you. However performing any gestures with it is bound to be super awkward and it could explain why Sony isnt doing those. More important downside is that the side placement means you need to have some extra bezel next to your screen for the module to fit. This doesnt really go great with the current consumer demands for larger screens in bodies as narrow as possible so they are still manageable. Finally, an exciting new development could see the fingerprint sensor being placed underneath the display itself, which should take care of a few of the issues listed above at the same time. Rumor even had it that Samsung wanted to go that way with the Galaxy S8, but the technology wasnt ready in time and the company had to make a last minute change and go with a rear-mounted sensor (that should also explain its off-center positioning. To answer your other question - theres no clear favorite position among our team. Yours truly would go with a rear-mounted sensor anytime, but many of my colleagues swear by the frontal location. The Sony side position also has a few fans, so its a pretty even split. Anonymous: Can you please explain the differences between screen types used in smartphones? Many users always ask about it and we do not have a clear understanding of TN, TFT, IPS, LCD, LED, OLED, AMOLED & Super AMOLED. There are also confusing combination like IPS LCD, IPS-Neo, TFT LCD and so on. Sometimes I thought it is a typo on your behalf when reading the phone specs though I might be the ignorant one here. Theres plenty written on the web on the differences between the different screen types, but by asking this question I assume you want a quick and simple explanation rather than a bunch of technical terms. There are two main types of screens - LCD and OLED (AMOLED is an OLED sub-type and all OLED smartphones use AMOLD panels). LCD is the older technology and it relies on a backlight that gets filtered through a layer of colored crystals to produce different colors. To display black it just makes that layer as non-transparent as possible, but it cant completely switch off the backlight as it will just shut off the entire display. With OLEDs on the other hand, each individual pixel lights up so when it needs to display black, the pixel just switches off. As for those other listed abbreviations - all smartphone LCDs are TFT, but spelling it out every time is a bit redundant so you dont see TFT LCD every time. TN and IPS are two different types of arrangements for the crystal arrangements with IPS being a newer technology and allowing for improved contrast and wider viewing angles. The LED is another type of LCD, where the backlight is not a single bulb but a bunch of small diodes. IPS-Neo on the other hand is merely a brand for a specific IPS LCD implementation. This means that the Neo doesnt identify a specific technology, but is merely a catchy name a maker has decided to use. Its much the same way with Super AMOLED - its the brand Samsung uses for its recent panels, but it doesnt mean anything by itself. At the end of the day specific implementation of different display types vary quite a bit so the only way to be sure what works for you is to either get the phone and see for yourself or check out the display section of our reviews. Jim H: What was the effect of standardizing of brightness for battery life tests? Did the numbers tend to decrease for the majority of phones tested? Which brands or phones were benefiting the most from a lower brightness at the previous test's percentage? For the majority of phones the effect was minimal - a large percentage of those were close to 200 nits at their respective 50% settings, so it didnt really make much difference. And no there wasnt a decrease across the board - weve only done the test both ways on a few handsets and some did slightly better, some slightly worse. None saw a dramatic change though. What it helped though is in seeding out the outliers - the ones who had their brightness south of 100nits and the ones that had over 300 nits at 50%. We hope that this move has made their battery test results more comparable to the other tested devices. Some of the outliers in question include pre-Android Blackberries, which usually had significantly higher brightness level than 200nits - upwards of 300 nits. Most Huawei and Meizu phones had brightness bellow 150nits - often closer to 100nits and those might have scored differently under the old testing procedures. Nokia Lumia phones were all over the place - some significantly lower than 200 nits, while other were much higher.Samsung's tablets had an average brightness of around 300nits. But you have got to remember that we transitioned to the 200nit battery tests more than a full year ago (January 2016 to be precise), so the models tested the old way are already at the end of their life or on their way towards that.

Lily Hay Newman Security Date of Publication: 03.26.17. 03.26.17 Time of Publication: 7:00 am. 7:00 am How to Protect Your iCloud Account, Juuust in Case Those Hackers Aren’t Joking Getty Images A hacker group called Turkish Crime Family says that it can access 250 million iCloud accounts, and will do so on April 7 to reset the password, locking people out of their accounts. They’ve even threatened to wipe people’s linked iPhones if Apple doesn’t pay up. And while it’s hard to tell how legitimate the threat is, their assertions make now as good a time to lock down your iCloud as ever. The group says it has seven members, and has requested $700,000 from Apple to stand down. It also may be planning a demonstration of what they can do prior to the deadline. “We have something planned soon before the attack,” a member of the group tells WIRED. For its part, Apple says that the group doesn’t pose a threat. “There have not been any breaches in any of Apple’s systems including iCloud and Apple ID,” the company said in a statement. “The alleged list of email addresses and passwords appears to have been obtained from previously compromised third-party services. We’re actively monitoring to prevent unauthorized access to user accounts and are working with law enforcement to identify the criminals involved.” And yet the claims merit some credence, as the hackers have demonstrated that they can access a small group of accounts. That’s not proof of broad iCloud access, though. It’s a common practice on today’s internet for hackers to comb through username and password combinations from older company data breaches, and find credential sets that still work on other services. If someone reused the same password across numerous sites and then never changed it, all of those accounts become vulnerable as the result of one breach. “If there was a breach or not, you’ll have to wait and see otherwise it is empty threats and just allegations,” says one of the hackers, which may be the best assessment of the situation yet. Just to be safe, here’s how to protect yourself in case something sinister really is brewing. Password Perfect First, change your password. Especially if it’s one that you also use on other accounts. A password manager can certainly help with this, but if you’d rather go the manual route there are some can’t-miss best practices you should deploy. You want to change your password to something that’s at least 12-15 characters, and the longer the better, even if it has fewer random characters in it. Also make it an obscure reference—no pet names, first street you lived on, or mother’s maiden name. The full name of your childhood imaginary friend that you’ve always been too embarrassed to tell anyone about could work. Bonus if that imaginary friend had an imaginary birthday and you can sprinkle the digits throughout. You get the idea. Now head to your Apple ID page, sign in, and click Change Password. Seriously, go ahead. I’ll wait here. But actually. Two-Factor Everything In Beyond changing your password, there’s another robust step you can take to protect your iCloud account from what hacks may come. By setting up Apple’s two-factor authentication you add an extra security protection to your account that will keep intruders out even if they do have your current password. (Legacy Apple devices that can’t facilitate two-factor authentication for Apple ID because they’re too old can still use Apple’s “two-step verification” protection). Turning on some type of second-factor authentication will protect you from whatever is going on in this Turkish Crime Family situation, along with all sorts of other types of potential attacks. You can turn the feature on in the iCloud Settings/System Preferences tabs of iOS and macOS devices, or you can log into your AppleID account, scroll down to Security, and turn the service on under the Two-Factor Authentication section. From there, set up trusted—your iPhone and MacBook—that can receive the numeric codes that will act as the second authentication factor along with your password whenever you (or anyone) tries to log into your iCloud account from a new device. Without also having physical access to your trusted device, a hacker won’t be able to complete the login. Once you change your iCloud password to something strong and unique (which you already did, right?) and turn on two-factor authentication you should be good to go. Whether Turkish Crime Family is legit or full of it, you’ll have improved the security on an important and valuable account. Go Back to Top.

Something about turning an iPhone and iPad into a laptop? A phone-powered modular MacBook? A superdock? The application in the spotlight is simply titled "Electronic Accessory Device" and was published March 23 by the US Patent and Trademark Office. It was first filed back in September last year and the inventor is listed as Brett Degner. Patent talk for the uninitiated is difficult to understand, so translations from Apple watchers in English that breathed some life into diagrams and descriptions in the patent were highly appreciated. The patent's abstract stated that "The present application describes various embodiments of systems and methods for providing internal components for portable computing devices having a thin profile. More particularly, the present application describes an electronic accessory device available to extend and expand usefulness of a portable computing device." One interpretation: Imagine you have your keyboard and screen unit but your iPhone is doing all the work. Over to AppleInsider: "An Apple patent application published Thursday details a so-called 'thin' portable hardware accessory that boasts the components necessary to act as a laptop surrogate for iPhones and iPads." Mikey Campbell further discussed what he thought this was all about. "Specifically, the IP covers a 'thin' accessory, a kind of 'headless' device that contains traditional laptop hardware like a large display, physical keyboard, GPU, ports and more, but is incapable of functioning without a host. In this case, an iPhone or iPad would slot into the laptop-esque piece of kit to fill the role of CPU." Gerald Lynch, Associate Editor of TechRadar, noted how "The case would essentially be useless without a smartphone housed inside it." The phone would take on the role of being the CPU core for the shell. In one embodiment, Campbell said, "the accessory includes a port shaped to accommodate a host iPhone or iPad. Located in the base portion, this slot might also incorporate a communications interface and a means of power transfer, perhaps Lightning or a Smart Connector." Lynch in TechRadar said, "Communications and shared power between the two devices could be transferred over Lightning or a Smart Connector port, with the iPhone acting as a trackpad with Force Touch haptics." Tyler Lee in Ubergizmo said the application talked about the smartphone, such as the iPhone, being used to dock inside a slot on the laptop "in which not only would it power the device, but it will also double up as a trackpad for the computer as well." So what are the chances this patent idea would eventually be advanced to a real product? AppleInsider suggested we should not hold our breath. "Considering Apple's stance on portable computing, especially recent advertising campaigns touting iPad as a laptop replacement, it is highly unlikely that today's published application will make its way to market. That said, the invention suggests Apple is, or at least was, mulling an expansion of its iOS device lineup to a point that blurs the line between handheld device and laptop." Lynch seemed to have a similar verdict. He said, "with the iPad Pro already existing as Apple's halfway home between a mobile and work-focused device, the Cupertino seems to already have the base covered that this curio would be looking to hit." While it may or may never become a product, Paul Lilly in Hot Hardware said Apple "might be testing the design in some lab in Cupertino, along with other experiments. It's certainly an interesting idea, though."         LATEST STORIES (4) Syrian Army Forces Strike Terrorists' Defense Lines in Maarzaf, North of Hama Syrian Pro-Gov't Forces Regain Territory in Counter-Offensive near Mahardah Syria: Over 250 Gunmen Leave Key District in Homs City Iraqi Security Forces Resume Anti-Terrorist Operation in Western Mosul Nuclear Disarmament: The Myth of UN Conference…Again Iran, My Beautiful Country: Nowruz Passengers in Shiraz Syrian Army Scores more Victories against ISIL along Aleppo-Raqqa Highway Syrian Troops Block ISIL Terrorists in Northeast Aleppo amid Fighting Syrian Armed Forces Hit Terrorists' Centers Hard West of Aleppo Province Syria: Kurdish-Led Fighters Push ISIL back from More Positions in Western Raqqa Senior Terrorist Commander Killed in Clashes with Syrian Army in Hama Syrian Army Discovers US-Made Arms in Terrorists' Positions in Aleppo Province Syrian Army Makes Fresh Advances in Eastern Damascus, Kills Hundreds of Terrorists Syria: Hundreds of Gunmen, Family Members Leave Key District in Homs Syrian Army Wards off Terrorists' Attack in Northern Homs Syrian Army Forces Strike Terrorists' Defense Lines in Maarzaf, North of Hama TEHRAN (FNA)- The Syrian army units and their allies eliminated dozens of Nusra terrorists' vehicles and killed a number of militants during an assault near the town of Maarzaf in the Northwestern part of Hama province.

It comes after it was revealed that Westminster terror attacker Khalid Masood accessed WhatsApp a few minutes before unleashing his bloody assault on Parliament. The Home Secretary said chat service WhatsApp offering ‘end-to-end’ encryption which can prevent British intelligence agents snooping on conversations is ‘absolutely unacceptable’. She threatened to ban the app if they would not allow them to break the security measure. And she called on Apple CEO Tim Cook to allow the Government to snoop on private messages sent and received on Apple devices. (Photo: PA) Apple CEO Tim Cook (Photo: Publicity Picture) End-to-end encryption means messages can only be decoded by the sender or receiver. Apple and WhatsApp could not decrypt messages sent through their services if they wanted to. Read More Why is WhatsApp adding encryption and what does it mean for your messages? And this kind of security is not only used by messaging services. It’s used, entirely legitimately, by banks and healthcare providers to protect users from hackers. Were it to be banned, millions of people would find themselves more vulnerable to online criminals. But like her predecessor Theresa May , Amber Rudd did not seem to have a grasp of these issues during her interview with the BBC’s Andrew Marr. (Photo: Leon Neal) She said: “We need to make sure that organisations like WhatsApp and there are a number of others like that do not provide a secret place for terrorists to communicate with each other. “It used to be that people would steam open envelopes or just listen into phones when they wanted to find out what people were doing. Legally, through warrantry. But we need to make sure that our intelligence services can get into situations like encrypted WhatsApp.” Read More Even Theresa May doesn't understand her Snooper's Charter says scathing report by MPs Apple’s Tim Cook was embroiled in a long-running feud with the FBI over his refusal to unlock an iPhone owned by one of the San Bernadino shooters. He argued giving government agencies a key to unlock any device they wanted to would be an “unprecedented step which threatens the security of our customers.” WhatsApp (Photo: Getty) And he said: “It would be wrong for the government to force us to open a back door into our products.” Others have compared the request to asking a locksmith to make it easier to pick locks, leaving all users vulnerable to attack. But Ms Rudd, again, appeared to misunderstand the concept: “If I was talking to Tim Cook I would say to him this is something completely different. We’re not saying ‘open up’. Read More Why is WhatsApp adding encryption and what does it mean for your messages? “We don’t want to go into the cloud. We don’t want to do all sorts of things like that. But we do want them to recognise that they have a responsibility to engage with government, to engage with law enforcement agencies, when there is a terrorist situation. “We would do it all through the carefully thought through, legally covered arrangements, but they cannot get away with saying they are a different situation. They are not.” (Photo: PA) The Home Secretary said she had invited a “fairly long list” of players in the tech industry, including some smaller developers, to discussions on how they can work with government to “deliver the answer.” poll loading Should the government have access to encrypted messages? 0+ VOTES SO FAR Yes No Asked if she would be willing to legislate to ban WhatsApp or end-to-end encryption, she said: “I do agree that we have to have a situation where we can have our security services get in to the terrorist communications. That’s absolutely the case.

Sweat drips down their forehead as a progress bar approaches 99 per cent. Their furious typing reaches a crescendo as the soundtrack swells dramatically, before finally reaching its peak: 100 per cent. “I’m in.” Be it CSI, NCIS, or another acronymic police procedural, the figure of the ‘genius hacker’ has become a ubiquitous plot cliché. However, in recent times hacking has been gracing our screens for a different and more sinister reason. Allegations that Russian hackers may have interfered in the 2016 US presidential election rocked the political landscape and cast doubt over the integrity of our political system. Just this month, Lloyds Banking Group suffered a massive breach of its online security, three men were jailed after stealing over £2 million through ATM hacking, and the perpetrator of 2014’s hacks on the personal phones of celebrities, including Jennifer Lawrence and Taylor Swift, was jailed for nine months. “As technology and the internet become ever more omnipresent in our day-to-day lives, cybersecurity is going to (or has already) become as important to us as the physical locks on our homes, vehicles, and safes.” For all the headlines, however, very few of us understand how these attacks actually take place. We entrust all of our personal information to myriad devices, websites, and businesses, and have to rely on faith that our personal information – photos, videos, bank details, text messages, emails – will be secure. As technology and the internet become ever more omnipresent in our day-to-day lives, cybersecurity is going to (or has already) become as important to us as the physical locks on our homes, vehicles, and safes. However, there is a vital difference between the physical locks we use every day and the cryptographic locks companies use to safeguard our personal information. It is relatively easy to make a spare or replacement key for a physical lock – but doing so for a laptop or mobile phone, as the FBI found out in the case of the 2015 San Bernadino shooter’s iPhone, carries much more risk. Apple’s refusal to create a ‘back-door’ to access data on a locked iPhone was lambasted by many, including FBI Director James Comey – who bafflingly compared Apple’s security measures to a “vicious guard dog” – and The Donald himself, advocating a boycott of all Apple products. The truth was much more complex. Building a ‘back-door’ into Apple’s stringent, encrypted security would not only have been potentially irreversible, but it would also have jeopardised the security of millions of users’ personal data. As Apple CEO Tim Cook explained to ABC News, “No-one, I don’t believe, would want a master key built that would turn hundreds of millions of locks. Even if that key were in the possession of the person that you trust the most, that key can be stolen.” He went on to describe the requisite software as “the software equivalent of cancer”. Cook’s analogy is apt. For all its sleek, sexy allure for budding TV writers, the term ‘hacking’ actually betrays the far cruder truth – that often, the process of accessing personal data involves bashing it from all sides until the protections surrounding it break. This type of attack is called a Distributed Denial of Services attack, or DDoS, and is by far the most common form of cyber-attack, usually perpetrated against large websites or corporations: huge breaches at Sony, Tesco, Lloyds, and Yahoo have all been DDoS attacks. The Denial of Service is typically achieved by bombarding the target with superfluous requests in an attempt to overload it. This can prevent access to bank accounts, credit cards, or online gaming accounts – and provide a sufficient smokescreen to steal personal information. Technology has turned us into culture addicts The term ‘computer virus’ was coined by Michel Crichton in his 1973 film, Westworld – a film with a degree of eerie prescience that might be responsible for its recent revival as a TV serial on HBO. Four decades later, computer viruses are still one of the means by which a cyber-criminal can attempt to gain access to ‘secure’ data. Particularly popular are those known as ‘keyloggers’, which covertly record the keystrokes of a computer user, including passwords, PINs, and security question responses. All it takes is for the victim to unintentionally click one wrong link, either in a fraudulent email or online. At the heart of this issue is an ongoing, constant battle between hackers, who are constantly finding new exploits and bugs in software, and companies like Apple, Samsung, and Microsoft are constantly updating their software to guard against them. Regular software updates can seem like a pain, and many people tend to delay updates until it begins to inconvenience their ability to send Snapchats or play Clash of Clans.

MENU Economy Business Politics and Policy Technology Reflections Arts, Culture & Society Anything But Books Entertainment & Variety Sports All News Authors Search Reflections Is the Virat Kohli the Donald Trump of clickbait? Concerned Reader March 26, 2017, 14:30IST share this article What do we enjoy more about the spectatorship of sports? The on-field action showcasing the dynamics of the dynamic tussle between competitive athletes? Or the gossip manufactured to prolong the TRP value of matches beyond their duration? The media narrativises life, at times to the point of nonsensicality, in order to have stories to sell. People don't need to buy it though. Dear Sir/Madam, Is Virat Kohli the Trump of cricket? Is Trump the Newton of football? Is Modi the Beethoven of Mohiniyattam? Is kuzhipaniyaram the rasmalai of Gobi-65? Do any of these questions make any sense? No. Then why is my son sitting at home and discussing this nonsense cricketing news with his friends on his phone as if it is the single-most pressing development in the world right now? Sir/Madam, I came home from a visit to the bank last evening hoping to relax at home with a good book or a documentary DVD from my modest collection. The good thing about my retirement lifestyle is that I finally have time for such pursuits. But as soon as I opened my front door I could hear my son (the one who works from home, I have mentioned him before) screaming at something or someone. Oh no, I thought to myself, Apple has launched a new product. My son has a great hatred of all Apple products. Whenever Apple launches anything new he will sit and watch the entire presentation, constantly passing comments at the TV or computer screen. Sometimes I will make a cup of coffee, sit down on a chair nearby, and watch him while this criminal waste of time and energy goes on. “Samsung did it first!” “Nobody will buy it at that price!” “Ha ha ha ha! No headphone jack” As this goes on at full volume I often wonder how did a bank employee and school teacher manage to give birth to such an idiot. But then when I entered the living room I saw that he was watching some news channel on TV. And some news anchor, who probably grew up inside a fire engine or a police car, was screaming some nonsense or the other about Virat Kohli. My son, of course, had set aside all his work for the day, and was avidly discussing these developments with some equally imbecilic friend on the phone. “How can they say such things about Kohli, machaan!” my son said. And then the idiot on the other side said something. And then my son responded: “Of course this is psychological warfare! They are preparing for Dharamsala.” Then a few moments of silence while idiot responded. And then my son: “Yeah but you can’t say that about Kohli…” This went on for about 20 minutes while I checked online for any cheap DNA testing services in the Anna Nagar area. Finally, my son put down the phone and switched off the TV. “What happened?” I asked my son ironically. “Appa, some Australian journalists are saying that Virat Kohli is the Donald Trump of cricket! I mean can you believe that?” “So what?” I said, “Why are you wasting time on such issues. Just enjoy the cricket and avoid all these nonsense things that are manufactured to engage idiots.” My son got very upset and said something about India being a free country and people should be free to care about whatever they want to. He then stormed out of the room. Then I loudly told my wife in the kitchen that I am thinking of buying one or even two iPads because I think they are excellent devices. Just to irritate him. Sir/Madam, why do you publish so much nonsense sports news. Ok. I understand that many people enjoy cricket. I also understand that some people are cricket fanatics. There are some people who are like this about other sports such as football or badminton. But does that mean we should dedicate time on our news channels and space in our esteemed newspaper to utterly pointless coverage of scandals that have nothing to do with the sport itself. Virat Kohli is the Trump of cricket? I am struggling to understand what that means. So I spent some time thinking about it. And I think it makes sense only if you consider that both men lead organisations that could ultimately lead to the destruction of society, culture and economy in India. Sir/madam, sports journalism, in my humble opinion, should start when a match starts and end 15 or 20 minutes after the match ends. When the players go home, so should the sports journalists. Sir/madam, I would be obliged if you would take this recommendation seriously. In closing, I am wondering if there is any chance you could do an in-depth investigation into whether it is possible for children to be assigned to wrong parents in maternity hospitals in the Madras area.

By: AFP | Beijiing | Updated: March 26, 2017 3:46 pm A Chinese court says Apple’s iPhone 6 is not a copy of a smartphone from a local manufacturer. A Beijing court has overturned a ruling that Apple’s iPhone 6 violated a Chinese manufacturer’s patent which saw the US tech giant ordered to cease selling the smartphone in China.  In May last year the Beijing intellectual property bureau had ruled that Apple violated design patents of Chinese maker Shenzhen Baili with its iPhone6 and iPhone 6 Plus, and would be barred from selling those models. Sales however were not suspended while Apple appealed against the administrative order. The Intellectual Property Court in Beijing on Friday ruled in favour of the California-based firm. The court “quashes the decision of the bureau” and “recognises that Apple … has not infringed the design patent filed by the company Shenzhen Baili”, according to the verdict reported by the state judicial daily Renmin Fayuan Ribao. The intellectual property bureau, an administrative body of Beijing municipality, had ruled that the two Apple phones infringed a Baili design patent. It had accused the US firm of having “copied” the exterior design of Baili’s 100C smartphone, which is characterised by a curved edge and rounded corners. Also read: Govt working on options for duty sops sought by Apple But the Beijing court ruled that the iPhone 6 had features that “completely change the effect of the entire product … and both phones are easily distinguishable in the eyes of consumers,” finding Baili’s claim was without legal basis. When it took on Apple in December 2014, Baili was a promising electronics firm, backed by internet giant Baidu and eager to tap the telecoms boom. But since then the company has collapsed, hit by public criticism of its products seen as poor quality and more so by China’s ultra-competitive smartphone market which has seen many start-ups go under. Even Apple is under pressure. While China, along with Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, remains its second largest market after the US, the Cupertino-based company saw its turnover in this “Greater China” region fall 12 percent in the last quarter of 2016. Apple’s market share has plummeted in mainland China, falling behind local competitors such as telecoms giant Huawei, newcomers Oppo and Vivo, and “internet of things” pioneer Xiaomi.Apple has already had intellectual property problems in China. In May 2016 a maker of “iphone” branded leather goods won a lawsuit filed by Apple as the court ruled Xintong Tiandi had registered the word as a trademark in 2007, while Apple smartphones did not officially go on sale in China until For all the latest Tech News, download Indian Express App now Tags: Apple Best of Express Budgam encounter: One militant, three civilians killed; CM urges restraint, Omar calls situation 'alarming' EntertainmentSunil Grover reveals future plans, leaves Kapil Sharma out: 'Tomorrow will be new, yet beautiful'.

More than 350 store employees at the new stores in Nanjing (China), Cologne (Germany) and Miami (US) welcomed thousands of customers at the grand openings. "Each store complements the local architecture, from the restored facade in Schildergasse to the 90-by-30-foot glass entryway of Apple Nanjing," the company said in a statement on Saturday. For the first time in each city, customers can explore The Forum -- a place where the local community can gather and learn. All the three stores also feature The Boardroom -- a space for local entrepreneurs, developers and business customers to get hands-on advice and training. On March 12, Apple reopened its store in St. Johns Town Center in Florida -- the 35th store company updated to its latest design in the US. Apple opened its first store on May 15, 2001, at the Tysons Corner Center mall, Virginia. --IANS sku/py/vt SEARCH More from Sify: talking point on sify news Latest Features Attacks on doctors SC pushes for out-of-court settlement of Ayodhya dispute CM Yogi Adityanath's residence purified BJP's Yogi Adityanath takes charge of Uttar Pradesh Goa assembly elections 2017: Winners About Us Data Center Cloud Computing Servers Cloud Applications Hosting MPLS VPN Network Services Disclaimer Privacy Policy Careers Feedback Advertise Digital © Copyright Sify Technologies Ltd, 1998-2017.

Share Tweet Share Tags : iOS-iOS+ Apple-Apple+ Patents-Patents+ Regulators in China had banned the iPhone 6/6 Plus in the country after finding that the phone infringed on the design patent belonging to the Shenzhen Baili 100c, pictured on right A ban in China that prevented Apple from selling the Apple iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in the country, has been reversed by a Chinese court. What set off the whole dispute was a claim by Shenzhen Baili Marketing Services that the 2014 iPhone models infringed on design patents it was awarded for its 100c mobile phone. In May, Apple's Chinese subsidiary and local retailer Zoomflight were ordered to stop selling the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in China by the Beijing Intellectual Property Office.   Apple and Zoomflight sued the regulators, and on Friday the Beijing Intellectual Property Court removed the ban. The court ruled that neither Apple or Zoomflight had infringed on the 100c handset, and noted that there was a lack of any proof that such an infringement took place. In addition, the regulator failed to follow due procedures while ordering the ban. Both the Beijing Intellectual Property Office and Shenzhen Baili said that they will take their time to determine whether an appeal is warranted. It wasn't a total victory for Apple. The tech titan had requested that the Patent Reexamination Board of State Intellectual Property Office remove the design patent awarded to Shenzhen Baili Marketing Services for the 100c model. When Apple was turned down, it took the matter to court and was once again rejected. Apple is considering an appeal of that ruling. So to recap, in court Apple won one case and lost one. The case it won removes a ban that had prevented them from selling the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in China. The case it lost simply means that the Shenzhen Baili still owns a design patent on the 100c phone. But as you can see from the photo showing both handsets, there really doesn't seem to be much in common between them, at least as far as the design of both models is concerned. source: Reuters, MacRumors New live photos surface of the Samsung Galaxy S8+ 25 Mar Prev news The Movado Connect, powered by Android Wear 2.0, is expected to launch 26 Mar Next news Close newer posts Facebook to scrap support for Messenger on Windows Phone 8 and 8.1 at the 26 Mar Alleged specs for the Samsung Galaxy S8 and Samsung Galaxy S8+ are right 26 Mar Best free Android and iOS games of the week!

And if you already wear glasses, get stronger lenses. Secondly, I don't even use an iPhone and have been an Android user for 95% of my life. Had this been about the Galaxy S7, I would have approached this story the same way. You find bias because you want to find bias in every article you read. And that makes you the fanboy.

The Cupertino-based company also released a red iPhone 7. Mac Rumors has the news. “The new 9.7-inch iPad is equipped with a faster Apple A9 chip and brighter Retina display compared to the iPad Air 2, which has been discontinued. It is also somewhat thicker and heavier than the iPad Air 2 since it lacks a fully laminated display with anti-reflective coating in order to keep costs down.” The article adds that the iPad’s specs are identical to the iPad Air 2. It has a 2048 x 1536 pixel resolution screen, an 8MP rear camera, and two speakers. The update to the 9.7 iPad Pro didn’t happen this week as expected. The new 9.7-inch iPad starts off at a very reasonable $329 for a 32GB model. Apple also put a special edition red iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus on sale. One can purchase the red iPhone 7 for $749 (128 GB storage) or $869 (256GB). The red iPhone 7 Plus will cost $849 (128GB) or $969 (256GB). Those who are thinking of getting the updated iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus may want to wait another six months for the iPhone 8 series, which is said to be a huge upgrade on the 10th anniversary of the iPhone. However, it’s still up in the air if the iPhone 8 will have a curved screen. Will the iPhone 8 have curved screen like Samsung’s Galaxy S7 Edge? [Image by Richard Drew/Getty Images] Recently, MacRumors reported that the iPhone 8 may not have the curved OLED screen that it was rumored to have. However, Apple Insider reported that Apple’s next smartphone may indeed have a curved OLED screen, but it won’t be curved as much as some had hoped. For others, this is okay since they don’t like looking at curved videos or photos. There are also some who think that a curved screen takes away important real estate space on a smartphone. Those who are planning on getting an iPhone 8 or iPhone 8 Plus in September may have a difficult time. As the Irish Examiner points out, the iPhone 8 will only be available in limited quantities when it hits stores in September. A recently conducted research report from a Barclays analysts predicts that a majority of the stock will be released later in the fourth quarter of 2017. Many people think Apple releases a limited quantity of a new product in order to create hype. When the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were released in 2014, there were also limited quantities, especially when it came to the 6 Plus. Soon, there were news reports of people camping out at different Apple Stores each night in hopes of getting their desired phone. Apple certainly took advantage of the hype. The AirPods are still hard to find. [Image by Daryl Deino] Speaking of hard to get, Apple’s AirPods are still almost impossible to find. If you try and buy the AirPods at Apple’s site, you will notice that most stores say they won’t have them in stock until May 15. However, stock has been trickling in to some stores during the week, even if a particular store doesn’t indicate stock of the AirPods on the website. The best thing to do is to go to an Apple Store location right when they open in the morning. Some people on Twitter are reporting actually seeing stock at an Apple Store.

Haha — MJ Naval (@THEmj_naval) March 23, 2017 It’s obvious that Apple didn’t predict what a big hit the AirPods would become. Not only have Apple’s buds earned excellent reviews from critics and consumers, but the Cupertino-based company is still having a hard time keeping up with demand three months after their release. While Apple’s stock may have declined in 2016, 2017 is a different story. The success of the AirPods and the hype for the iPhone 8 has put Apple back on top.

By Luke Johnson / Published 26th March 2017 GETTY/CONCEPT PHONES IPHONE 8 AVAILABILITY: The next iPhone could be harder to get hold of than you'd hoped The iPhone 8 is one of the most eagerly awaited handsets of recent times. A device that will mark 10 years of the iconic iPhone, it is expected to go on sale this September. You might not be able to get your hands on one right away, however. That’s because latest reports have suggested the upcoming challenger to the Samsung Galaxy S8 will be in seriously short supply come launch. Apple iPhone 8 - Leaked photographs, concept images and renders Friday, 6th January 2017 iPhone 8 is shaping up to be one of the most impressive Apple smartphones to date, with glass panels on the front and rear of the device, a curved borderless OLED display and no Home Button 1 / 10 VENIAMIN GESKIN • TWITTER • CONCEPT IMAGES Apple iPhone 8 will debut a brand-new all-glass look, with a curved OLED display and no physical Home Button While Apple has struggled to meet day one demand for a number of its major products, such as the jet black iPhone 7 and AirPods headphones, it’s been suggested that iPhone 8 availability could be more limited than ever. According to an investor note from Barclays analysts Blayne Curtis, Christopher Hemmelgarn, Thomas O’Malley, and Jerry Zhang, the majority of iPhone 8 stock won’t be available until towards the end of the year. “Suppliers generally had good things to say about the upcoming iPhone 8 launch (for our purposes iPhone 7s, iPhone 7s Plus, and iPhone Pro) as new features drive a more complicated manufacturing process and higher ASPs,” the investor note states. “We now believed that all three devices will feature wireless charging and will all be launched in the normal September timeframe, although the majority of iPhone Pro volumes may not be available until Q4,” it adds. CONCEPT PHONES Although it’s been suggested that iPhone 8 stock will be limited, it’s currently unclear how available the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus will be. While the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus are expected to bring only modest updates on Apple’s current smartphone crop, the iPhone 8 has been tipped to introduce major changes. These will reportedly included a radical new design that sees a glass-backed body paired with a display that curves around both the left and right hand edges of the device. Elsewhere, the phone’s trademark physical home button could finally be given the boot, with the handset’s Touch ID fingerprint scanner instead sliding under the screen itself. The iPhone 8 is expected to be the star of a major launch event this September, an event that could also see the Apple Watch 3 introduced. It won’t be the only new phone Apple launches this year, however. Earlier this week the Cupertino company dropped new iPhone SE storage options, as well as a stunning new Product Red iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus.

Last year a Beijing Intellectual Property Office ruled that the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus violated the design patent of a local phone and that's why Apple must stop selling both the products in the city. The tech giants were definitely not up for it and cleverly appealed the decision, letting iPhone 6 and 6 Plus stay in the market. As reported by South China Morning Post a Beijing Court has ruled in favour of Apple and that decision put an end to the ongoing patent dispute and "quashes the decision" stated by the original ruling. Moreover, the Court also stated that there are some clearly distinguishable features in the iPhone 6 that completely change the effect of the product and makes it dissimilar from that of Shenzhen Baili. The Chinese smartphone company initiated the lawsuit last year claiming that Apple actually copied the design of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus from its 100C smartphone. The basis of this charge was that both the companies' devices featured curved edges and rounded corners. But since then, the Chinese smartphone company has collapsed amid huge public criticism of its products and budget-focused Chinese market. Winning this lawsuit against Apple could salvage the company to some extent but now that chance is gone too. Apple is currently fighting legal battles with several companies, most remarkably with Nokia and Qualcomm.

Sunday Chronicle Hyderabad Chronicle Chennai Chronicle Bengaluru Chronicle Kerala Chronicle Science Editors' Picks Technology, In Other News Vulnerabilities disclosed by WikiLeaks have been fixed: Apple AP Published Mar 26, 2017, 8:37 am IST Updated Mar 26, 2017, 8:38 am IST The documents released by the anti-secrecy site Thursday morning pointed to an apparent CIA program to hack Apple devices.  (Representational image) Apple said purported hacking vulnerabilities disclosed by WikiLeaks this week have all been fixed in recent iPhones and Mac computers. The documents released by the anti-secrecy site Thursday morning pointed to an apparent CIA program to hack Apple devices using techniques that users couldn't disable by resetting their devices. The iPhone hack was limited to the 3G model from 2008. In a statement late Thursday, Apple said the flaw was fixed with the release of the iPhone 3GS a year later. Apple also said the Mac vulnerabilities were all fixed in all Macs launched after 2013. Apple's statement was consistent with assessments from security experts, who say that many of the apparent vulnerabilities were in older technology. Apple is going further in saying those flaws have all been fixed, based on its preliminary analysis. Security experts say the exploits described in the WikiLeaks documents are plausible, but suggest they pose little threat to typical users. Besides being likely out of date, the techniques also typically require physical access to devices, something the CIA would use only for targeted individuals, not a broader population. The CIA has not commented on the authenticity of this and earlier WikiLeaks revelations, but has previously said it complies with a legal prohibition against electronic surveillance "targeting individuals here at home, including our fellow Americans." The leaks Thursday came about two weeks after WikiLeaks published thousands of alleged CIA documents describing hacking tools it said the government employed to break into computers, mobile phones and even smart TVs from companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft and Samsung. WikiLeaks has offered to share further details with tech companies to help them fix flaws, though accepting such information might subject companies to certain conditions and put government contracts at risk. Apple addressed the offer for the first time in Thursday's statement. "We have not negotiated with WikiLeaks for any information," the statement read. "We have given them instructions to submit any information they wish through our normal process under our standard terms. Thus far, we have not received any information from them that isn't in the public domain." Apple said that while it takes users' security and privacy seriously, "we do not condone theft or coordinate with those that threaten to harm our users." Earlier, Microsoft said WikiLeaks had made initial contact through its public reporting channel, "and we have followed up, treating them as we would any other finder." Mozilla, the organization behind the Firefox web browser, also said it had been contacted through the email address it uses for security vulnerability reporting. Mozilla said it would take steps necessary to fix any vulnerabilities reported that way.

Chinese Court Rules in Apple’s Favor over iPhone 6 Patent Dispute GO A Chinese court reversed the ban in the country Mar 26, 2017 07:31 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  In 2016, Chinese officials ruled that Apple could no longer sell its iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus phones in the country, because they violated a manufacturer’s patent. Shenzhen Baili filed a lawsuit in June last year, claiming that Apple allegedly violated the patent of its 100c smartphone. After the lawsuit was filed, the Beijing Intellectual Property Office ruled that Apple’s iPhone 6 and 6 Plus did in fact infringe on patent rights, claiming that Apple allegedly copied the exterior design of the 100c phone. Chinese authorities ordered Apple to halt sales in Beijing, but the decision was overturned by an appeal and the phones remained on shelves. Recently, a Chinese Court ruled in favor of Apple and decided that the Cupertino company didn’t infringe the design of the patent filed by Shenzhen Baili company, according to Reuters. The Court said that Apple’s iPhone 6/6 Plus and Shenzhen Baili’s 100c were easily distinguishable for consumers. The decision surely pleases Apple, especially since the company recently released a red variant of its iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus models in China too. Apple wants the design patent to be removed The tech giant had requested the Patent Reexamination Board of State Intellectual Property Office to remove the design patent awarded for Shenzhen Baili’s 100c model, but the company was turned down. Apple is considering a second appeal of this decision. Shenzhen Baili has been struggling lately, as the company is no longer a competitor in the Chinese market and has lost its market share because of mismanagement and customers displeased with poor quality phones. Truth be told, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus barely resemble the design of Shenzhen Baili’s 100c smartphone. Only the sensor shape on the back of the phones is similar with a rounded design, while the position of the LED flash is completely different. In addition, Apple’s two devices have antenna lines on the back, which aren’t featured on the 100c. The difference is even more striking on the front panel, the 100c doesn’t have a physical home button and the position of the front sensor isn’t the same on both phones. #Apple#iPhone 6#iPhone 6 Plus#Patent dispute#Court ruling subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Police Warn Against Dangerous “Siri 108” Prank on iPhones Apple Could Release a Limited Number of iPhone 8 Units in September Apple Patent Shows Accessory That Transforms an iPhone or iPad into a MacBook Apple iPhone 6s Was the World’s Best-Selling Smartphone Last Year Two Laptops with Hong Kong's 3.7 Million Voters' Data Stolen Samsung Store in Singapore Catches Fire Ahead of Galaxy S8 Unveil All 2017 iPhones to Support Wireless Charging, Apple Watch to Feature LTE How to Upgrade to Windows 10 Creators Update RTM Right Now Survey: 93% of Millennials Aren't Quitting Uber Two Laptops with Hong Kong's 3.7 Million Voters' Data Stolen Latest Black Lab Linux Weekly Build Optimizes Swap File Management for SSD Windows 10, the Only Way to Go: 8 in 10 Companies to Install the OS, Study Shows    Apple iPhone 6 vs Shenzhen Baili's 100c phone new ios apps NeuroNation: Train your brain to improve your memory and focus with NeuroNation Flipagram: Create cool videos by mixing up your photos with music Timer+: Set up dozens of timers and control them all with ease Nutshell Camera: Create some pretty cool videos with Nutshell Camera IKEA Catalogue: Check out the IKEA Catalogue for more than just furniture Complete: Complete puts a social twist to your regular to-do list/ task manager WebMD Baby: WebMD Baby offers help in how to best tend to your baby Reader comments Apple Doubles iPhone SE Storage, Keeps the Same Price more on: Apple i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

By: PTI | New Delhi | Published:March 26, 2017 12:23 pm The government is working on certain options to accommodate demands related to tax and duty concessions sought by iPhone maker Apple for setting up a manufacturing unit in India. Although the Finance Ministry has prima facie rejected the demands of the US-based technology major, senior executives of the company met an inter-ministerial group recently to deliberate upon the issue. The group discussed at length the demands of the company, sources said, adding that the government is trying to find ways through which certain support measures could be extended to the American firm. Sources also said the company is asking for concessions as it wants to bring in its supply chain or component makers to the country as Apple cannot source inputs locally. The company also wants duty exemptions on the products to be bought from special economic zones (SEZs). At present, goods exported from SEZs do not attract any duty but import duties are levied if items produced in special economic zones are sold in the domestic market. There is a possibility that this demand could be met by the government as several domestic companies are also demanding for the same. On the other hand, certain duty concessions being sought by Apple are very difficult to meet as India is gradually becoming a manufacturing hub of smartphones. A strong supply chain is being established in the country despite any sop or concession offered to any player. Also, no domestic or foreign manufacturer has sought any concession from the government so far. There is dilemma that if the government extends support to Apple, it may weaken this strong supply chain. “So the government has to make a balance,” sources added. Apple has also sought relaxations for consumables for smartphone manufacturing and service or repair for 15 years. In January, Apple had indicated to the government that it is ready with a blueprint to begin manufacturing iPhones in India, but wants fiscal concessions, including customs duty waiver on import of components. The company sells its products through Apple-owned retail stores in countries like China, Germany, the US, the UK and France, among others. It has no wholly-owned store in India and sells its products through distributors such as Redington and Ingram Micro.

PHOTO: AFP A Chinese court has ruled in favor of Apple in design patent disputes between the Cupertino, California company and a domestic phone-maker, overturning a ban on selling iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus phones in China, Xinhua news agency reported. Last May, a Beijing patent regulator ordered Apple’s Chinese subsidiary and a local retailer Zoomflight to stop selling the iPhones after Shenzhen Baili Marketing Services lodged a complaint, claiming that the patent for the design of its mobile phone 100c was being infringed by the iPhone sales. Apple and Zoomflight took the Beijing Intellectual Property Office’s ban to court. Apple unveils updated iPad at lowest-ever price The Beijing Intellectual Property Court on Friday revoked the ban, saying Apple and Zoomflight did not violate Shenzhen Baili’s design patent for 100c phones. The court ruled that the regulator did not follow due procedures in ordering the ban while there was no sufficient proof to claim the designs constituted a violation of intellectual property rights. Representatives of Beijing Intellectual Property Office and Shenzhen Baili said they would take time to decide whether to appeal the ruling, according to Xinhua.

Apple first filed the request to the Patent Reexamination Board of State Intellectual Property Office. The board rejected the request, but Apple lodged a lawsuit against the rejection. The Beijing Intellectual Property Court on Friday ruled to maintain the board’s decision. It is unclear if Apple will appeal.

The smartphone would be strategically placed in about the same spot as a touchpad would on a regular Mac. Could Apple be planning such a move for the iPhone 8? The patent application, which was earlier discovered by AppleInsider, is called, simply, "Electronic accessory device." It says that the chassis would come with traditional computing parts, including a screen, keyboard, and GPU. But in order for it to actually be powered, you'd need to insert the iPhone into it and start working on the device as if it were a computer. MORE: iPhone 8 Camera Will Be All About AR, and Glasses Are Next The patent application is notable, given the rise of 2-in-1 hybrids that can act both as tablets and notebooks, effectively blurring the line between tablets and PCs. But no company has successfully married the phone and laptop yet. HP's Elite X3 is the most recent example, which connects to a laptop-like dock using Windows 10 Mobile's Continuum feature. Previous attempts to combine phone and laptop have included the ill-fated Palm Foleo and the Motorola Atrix Laptop Dock. Samsung doesn't look to be going the mobile route with its Galaxy S8, but it's expected to offer an optional desktop dock called DeX that could power 4K monitors, as well as a mouse and keyboard. Apple has conspicuously shied away from this kind of convergence and has said on numerous occasions that it believes there is -- and should be -- a clear distinction between mobile experiences and computing experiences. The latest patent application, however, suggests Apple is at least thinking about ways to bridge that gap. Specifically, the patent application calls for a way for data to be transferred between the devices. Additionally, the host device could have its own operating system installed, allowing you to simply use the iPhone's processor for power and access alternative software that would be running on the device. But it goes further. In a striking move, Apple's patent describes a touchscreen for the host device -- a feature we've yet to see in an Apple computer and something the company's executives say, doesn't work in the computing space. Another embodiment in the device sees an iPad acting as its screen. It's not clear whether a device like this will ever make its way to store shelves. Like other big companies, Apple files for patents on a slew of technologies, and many of them are never released. But an iPhone-powered laptop is definitely an intriguing idea.

Last May, a Beijing patent regulator ordered Apple’s Chinese subsidiary and a local retailer Zoomflight to stop selling the iPhones after Shenzhen Baili Marketing Services lodged a complaint, claiming that the patent for the design of its mobile phone 100c was being infringed by the iPhone sales. Apple and Zoomflight took the Beijing Intellectual Property Office’s ban to court. The Beijing Intellectual Property Court on Friday revoked the ban, saying Apple and Zoomflight did not violate Shenzhen Baili’s design patent for 100c phones. The court ruled that the regulator did not follow due procedures in ordering the ban while there was no sufficient proof to claim the designs constituted a violation of intellectual property rights. Representatives of Beijing Intellectual Property Office and Shenzhen Baili said they would take time to decide whether to appeal the ruling, according to Xinhua. In a related ruling, the same court denied a request by Apple to demand stripping Shenzhen Baili of its design patent for 100c phones. Apple first filed the request to the Patent Reexamination Board of State Intellectual Property Office. The board rejected the request, but Apple lodged a lawsuit against the rejection. The Beijing Intellectual Property Court on Friday ruled to maintain the board’s decision. It is unclear if Apple will appeal.

A new 9.7-inch iPad debuted with an impressively low $329 price point, and there's now a red aluminum iPhone 7, both of which go on sale this Friday, March 24 at 8:01 AM Pacific Time. New Apple Watch bands are out, there are iPhone cases in new colors, Apple is about to release an app for making videos, and the iPhone SE and the iPad mini 4 got new minimum storage tiers and pricing drops. We've recapped everything Apple announced today in the video below, and we've rounded up all of our new product coverage. - Apple Debuts New 9.7-Inch iPad With A9 Chip to Replace iPad Air 2, Starting at $329 - iPad Mini 4 With 128GB of Storage Now Starts at $399 as 32GB Model Discontinued - Apple Unveils Special Edition (PRODUCT)RED iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus - Apple Announces Video Creation iOS App 'Clips' - Apple Doubles iPhone SE Storage to 32GB and 128GB - Apple Watch Gets New Striped Woven Nylon, Classic Buckle, and Standalone Nike Sport Bands - Apple Launches New Silicone and Leather iPhone 7 Case Colors - Apple Discontinues iPad Mini 2 - Swift Playgrounds Now Available in Five Additional Languages While we saw new devices today, there's still quite a bit on the horizon. The much-rumored ~10-inch iPad with a revamped design has yet to make an appearance, and we're still awaiting a new 12.9-inch iPad Pro, too, along with Kaby Lake Macs and the highly anticipated iPhone 8. With no event coming up in the near future, we may be waiting until June's Worldwide Developers Conference or the fall to see many of these new releases but make sure to keep an eye on MacRumors for the latest rumors on Apple's launch plans.

I was hoping for something a little more than coloured watch bands and minor bump updates to 3 year old products. I guess they really just spending all their focus on the new campus or something. For such a large rich company, I would have expected at least regular bumps on things like the macs. The words of Phill still ring in my ears "Can't innovate my ass". Maybe? but they sure cant produce regular updates other than new coloured stuff. Rating: 25 Votes Steve121178 1 week ago Underwhelming and not that exciting. This is starting to sound all too familiar. Rating: 20 Votes keysofanxiety 1 week ago People quickly forget this was just mentioned by Apple as store maintenance. Sure, you're welcome to complain about Macs not being updated. However it's a bit foolish to have expected anything from today but bumped storage and a few minor updates.

We need new Macs. Rating: 10 Votes AppleScruff1 1 week ago I find the complainers interesting. Apple is a company. It is a public company with stock. It has to do quarterly reports. It grows at >20% per year. It has a P/E under 17 which is less than 20+8. It has room to go up on a P/E basis alone. The admitted marginal improvements in mature products acknowledged, it is an ANNUITY. There is no end in sight. Devices become functionally obsolete and "need" to be replaced at a rate. ~2 years for a phone, ~4 years for a pad, ~4-6 years for a Mac. Apple simply adjusted to the reality of its market. It even changed its name! It has significant user base growth! Great for the non stockholding consumer! I'm sure profit and growth are the major concerns for Joe Consumer.

While the new red iPhone models won't be available for purchase until Friday, March 24, tech YouTuber Marques Brownlee got his hands on one of the new devices early, and has shown it off in the first (PRODUCT)RED iPhone unboxing video. The (PRODUCT)RED iPhone ships in a box decorated with red text and a red iPhone, and inside, there's a (PRODUCT)RED insert alongside the regular manuals. Aside from that, the packaging is the same as other iPhone models with a charging cable and Lightning EarPods. Brownlee's first reaction to the (PRODUCT)RED iPhone was "Wow, this thing is really red and really good looking." He goes on to say that it's as "ridiculously good as you think," and calls it the most photogenic iPhone he's seen in a long time. According to Brownlee, in person, the device has an almost satin finish that is super saturated, and because it's not as dark as the Matte and Jet Black iPhones, it isn't as prone to showing fingerprints. Brownlee is not a fan of the white front of the device (he calls it "goofy") and says he'd prefer it with a black front. Apple release the Special Edition (PRODUCT)RED iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus to celebrate more than 10 years of partnership with the (RED) charity. All (PRODUCT)RED purchases let customers contribute to the Global Fund to join the fight against HIV and AIDS. Over the course of its 10 year partnership with (RED), Apple has been responsible for donating more than $130 million and is the largest corporate donor to the Global Fund. The new (PRODUCT)RED iPhone models are available in 128GB and 256GB storage capacities, priced at $749/$849 for the iPhone 7 and $869/$969 for the iPhone 7 Plus. As mentioned above, the new devices will go on sale on Friday in more than 40 countries around the world.

File Photo Apple has sought relaxations for consumables for smartphone manufacturing and service or repair for 15 years. New Delhi, Mar 26:   The government is working on certain options to accommodate demands related to tax and duty concessions sought by iPhone maker Apple for setting up a manufacturing unit in India. Although the Finance Ministry has prima facie rejected the demands of the US-based technology major, senior executives of the company met an inter-ministerial group recently to deliberate upon the issue. The group discussed at length the demands of the company, sources said, adding that the government is trying to find ways through which certain support measures could be extended to the American firm. Sources also said the company is asking for concessions as it wants to bring in its supply chain or component makers to the country as Apple cannot source inputs locally. The company also wants duty exemptions on the products to be bought from special economic zones (SEZs). At present, goods exported from SEZs do not attract any duty but import duties are levied if items produced in special economic zones are sold in the domestic market. There is a possibility that this demand could be met by the government as several domestic companies are also demanding for the same. On the other hand, certain duty concessions being sought by Apple are very difficult to meet as India is gradually becoming a manufacturing hub of smartphones. A strong supply chain is being established in the country despite any sop or concession offered to any player. Also, no domestic or foreign manufacturer has sought any concession from the government so far. There is dilemma that if the government extends support to Apple, it may weaken this strong supply chain. “So the government has to make a balance,” sources added. Apple has also sought relaxations for consumables for smartphone manufacturing and service or repair for 15 years. In January, Apple had indicated to the government that it is ready with a blueprint to begin manufacturing iPhones in India, but wants fiscal concessions, including customs duty waiver on import of components. The company sells its products through Apple-owned retail stores in countries like China, Germany, the US, the UK and France, among others. It has no wholly-owned store in India and sells its products through distributors such as Redington and Ingram Micro.

Apple hasn’t confirmed an iOS 10.3 release date for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch but it’s getting close. Real close. Apple’s pushed rapid fire iOS 10.3 beta updates, a sign the upgrade is making substantial progress behind the scenes. The release of iOS 10.3 beta 7 came less than a week after the company released an iOS 10.3 beta 6 for developers and those in its free Beta Software Program. And thanks to new product announcements, we now know the iOS 10.3 update should be out sometime before the end of April. Apple’s new Clips app is scheduled for release next month and iOS 10.3 will be required to use it on the iPhone, iPad or iPod touch. We still don’t have an official iOS 10.3 release date to share but we do have some tips that could help you on the road to its release. iOS 10.3 Release Time The iOS 10.3 update is shaping up to be an exciting release. Its packed with new features, performance enhancements, and tweaks. While you might be tempted to check your phone every 15 minutes for the update, that’s not how Apple iOS releases work. It’s difficult to predict the exact iOS 10.3 release date but it’s very easy to predict the iOS 10.3 release time. Here are a few things to keep in mind as we close in on the iOS 10.3 release date: Apple never releases iOS updates on the weekend so there’s no need to check for iOS 10.3 on Saturday or Sunday. iOS updates almost always arrive between 9AM and 10AM Pacific. General rule of thumb is to check around 10AM Pacific. While some of you will want to download the iOS 10.3 update the second it arrives, many others will want to wait. Skip the iOS 10.3 Beta We’re now on iOS 10.3 beta 7 which means we’re really close to the official release. With an iOS 10.3 release imminent, most people should avoid the iOS 10.3 beta and wait for the official release. The potential headaches aren’t worth it at this point. Prepare Your iPhone, iPad or iPod With an iOS 10.3 release date likely just days away, now is the perfect time to start preparing for the update’s release. Here are a few pre-installation tips to keep in your back pocket as we approach the arrival of iOS 10.3: Use this time to cleanup your device. Get rid of files (apps, music, etc), anything you no longer use. Cleaning up your device could improve your device’s performance. Start backing up your data. If you don’t know where to start, you’ll want to research iCloud backups, iTunes backups, and the differences between the two. This is especially important due to the arrival of AFPS. If you want to download iOS 10.3 right when it comes out, make sure your device has at least a 50% charge (or you’re near a charger) around 10AM Pacific. Get your login information handy. Make sure you have the device’s passcode, Apple ID, and your important logins ready on release day. The update might log you out of various apps and services. Dig into feedback from iOS 10.3 beta testers. You might learn about a potential problem or benefit to your version of iOS 10.3. A little prep work will help you avoid major problems during the iOS 10.3 installation process. It’ll also help you avoid headaches once you get the new update on board your phone or tablet. Learn About iOS 10.3 Make sure you know what you’re getting into before you download the iOS 10.3 update on your phone. This goes deeper than just perusing the change log Apple will include with the update. You’ll want to dig deeper, especially if you own an older device. iOS 10.3 isn’t officially out for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch but thanks to the iOS 10.3 beta for developers and the general public, we know what to expect. A new iCloud storage breakdown in iOS 10.3 shows you exactly how your using your space. We’ve put together a broad guide to the iOS 10.3 update. We’ve also put together some in-depth analysis of the iOS 10.3 update’s most exciting features. We’ve also detailed some of iOS 10.3’s small but important features. You’ll also want to get familiar with the new Clips application that’s set to arrive in April. Again, you’ll need to download iOS 10.3 in order to use the Clips app on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch. If you haven’t been following the iOS 10.3 beta, now would be a good time to dig in. We don’t expect the update to change much between now and the official release date and we don’t expect the beta to be too much different from the official version of iOS 10.3. Download iTunes 12.6 Now would be a good time to download the latest version of iTunes. Apple recently released iTunes 12.6. The update delivers some bug fixes and performance improvements and it also delivers an exciting feature that requires iOS 10.3 to work on iPhone and iPad. iTunes 12.6 marks the debut of a “Rent once, watch anywhere” that allows you to watch iTunes rentals across all of your devices provided they’re running iOS 10.3 or tvOS 10.2. If you rent movies from iTunes you’ll probably want to download the latest version. You’ll also probably want to download the iOS 10.3 update as soon as it arrives. Report iOS 10.3 Problems If you choose to install iOS 10.3 on release day there’s a chance you’ll run into an issue during or after the installation process finishes up. If you do run into an iOS 10.3 problem on your phone, there’s no need to panic. Sometimes it can take a couple of days for an update to settle in. If you notice weird battery life on release day, give it a day or two to even out. If problems persist after two days with iOS 10.3, or if the issues are serious, you’ll want to take action. There are tons of resources out there but our list of fixes for common iOS 10 problems is a great place to start. If you don’t consider yourself an expert, you’ll want to bookmark those fixes so you’re ready to tackle problems as soon as they popup. If you can’t fix your problem and/or you want to help the community, you’ll want to report iOS 10.3 problems as you see them. There are a few places to do that. You can relay your problem to Apple Support on Twitter and/or get in contact with Apple Support via the company’s website. We also recommend reporting your problem on Apple’s Discussion forums to alert Apple and other users to your issue. You Can Test iOS 10.3 Remember, if you don’t want to deal with the iOS 10.3 beta, you can take the official version of iOS 10.3 for a test drive provided you’re already on iOS 10.2.1. For a short time, Apple will allow you to drop back down to iOS 10.2.1. You won’t be able to downgrade to anything older than iOS 10.2.1 and it will only be open for a short period of time, probably a couple of weeks tops. Most of you will choose to remain on iOS 10.3 but others might benefit from dropping down to the older version of iOS 10. If you aren’t familiar with the iOS downgrade process, now is the time. How to Get Off iOS 10.3 Beta If you chose to try the iOS 10.3 beta and you don’t want to get thrown onto the next iOS 10 beta (iOS 10.3.1? iOS 10.4?), you’ll want to unenroll from the iOS 10.3 beta once the final version is released. Here’s how to do that. Go to Settings > General > Profiles and then tap the iOS Beta Software Profile that appears on your device. Enter your passcode, if there is on associated with the device, and tap Delete Profile. You will no longer receive beta software. Go into your Settings or iTunes and download iOS 10.3. If you’ve been running an iOS 10.3 and the watchOS beta on your Apple Watch, you’ll need to take a few more steps before, on, or after the iOS 10.3 release date. Here’s how to get the watchOS beta off your device, Open the Apple Watch app on your iPhone. Tap the My Watch tab. Go to General > Profiles. Tap the beta profile you want to remove. Enter a passcode if needed and then tap Delete Profile. If you want to use beta software again you’ll need to install the correct beta profile. 4 Reasons Not to Install iOS 10.3 & 6 Reasons You Should Install iOS 10.3 If You Want Better Security   1 / 10 If you value your security, you'll want to seriously consider downloading the iOS 10.3 update on your iPhone or iPad.  The iOS 10.3 update brings over 60 known patches for potential exploits. That's substantial, even for a milestone upgrade. The previous version of iOS 10, iOS 10.2.1, brought 14 known patches. Among them is a patch for a Safari ransomware bug that scammers used to extort iOS users who viewed pornography on their device.  These patches enhance the security on your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch making them ideal for those of you who store sensitive files/data on your device. Most people do. If you skipped the iOS 10.2.1 update and/or the iOS 10.2 update, know that iOS 10.3 brings their security patches with it as well. Again, the iOS 10.2.1 update had 14 important patches on board. You can see them all right here.  If you failed to install Apple's iOS 9.3.5 update, iOS 10.3 will also bring the three crucial security patches it delivered last year. These patch up serious security problems that could potentially expose your calls, contacts, texts, and emails. If security is important to you, iOS 10.3 is probably worth a download right now.   1 / 10 One Response 03/25/2017 James Burton Reply Hi I’m impressed with the amber alert system in the future is there going to be FBI warrants support Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

Digital Trends Home > DT Daily > Apple says it took care of CIA spyware… Apple says it took care of CIA spyware vulnerabilities years ago By Bill Roberson — March 24, 2017 12:34 PM Share Please enable Javascript to watch this video Subscribe on YouTube Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why are we not totally reassured? Following revelations that the CIA developed snooping tools for Apple Mac computers and iPhone, Cupertino has responded by saying the exploits are outdated and were dealt with years ago. In a statement to Tech Crunch, Apple said they wanted to assure users their devices are safe and secure and that the malware detailed by Wikileaks would only work on the iPhone 3G, so if you still are using one, might be time for an upgrade? Yeah… Apple also said they had no “special deal” with Wikileaks and were treating their findings as they would any bug report. As for what the CIA has cooked up since the era of the iPhone 3G, who knows. Oh yeah, that thing Twitter, which always seems to be on the brink of financial collapse, rummaged around in their junk drawer recently and suddenly remembered they owned TweetDeck, and thought, “hey, maybe we could make some money with this thing.” On Thursday, numerous users posted clues that Twitter may use Tweetdeck as a foundation for a paid Twitter service with premium features such as advanced publishing features, no ads and more. So how much? $20 a month has been floated, but so has $5 a month, a figure that doesn’t cut into our beer budget as much. Twitter acquired Tweetdeck way back in 2011 for 40 million, and it looks like it could return soon – for a fee. Time keeps on slipping into the future… Everyone wants to live forever, or, at least, for a while longer than nature currently allows, and new research shows that after a while, your blood gets old while you… also get old. So if you could make your blood young again, might that help slow down the aging process. Looks like it might. Researchers in Germany say “young blood” that’s been genetically modified appears to have health benefits and may reverse some aging processes. It’s part of Stem cell research and while the investigation is ongoing, the signs are promising. Check out our the full story at the link and stop trying to figure out how to be a sexy vampire. We’ve got more news on our Facebook page and YouTube channel, and be sure to tune in to this week’s DT podcasts: Close to the Metal (computers and such) on Tuesday, Trends with Benefits (general tech shenanigans)  on Thursdays, and Between the Streams (movie and TV topics) every Friday.
Digital Trends Home > Mobile > Drool over these photos of Apple’s new ruby… Drool over these photos of Apple’s new ruby iPhone 7 (RED) By Kyle Wiggers and Julian Chokkattu — March 24, 2017 1:36 PM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you Apple has long contributed to the fight against HIV/AIDS, and the new iPhone (Red) is a continuation of that trend. Move over, jet black. Red is the iPhone’s hot new color. In partnership with nonprofit Product (RED), Apple added a brand-new, bright ruby red iPhone to its roster: The iPhone (RED). Like the company’s (RED) iPod Nano, (RED) Beats headphones, and (RED) Smart Battery cases, the launch is intended to promote ongoing efforts by Product (RED) to combat HIV and AIDS, which remains one of the globe’s worst health problems. More than 35 million people have died of the virus, and 37 million are infected each year, according to Product (RED). More: Apple iPhone 7 review As with Apple’s other Product (RED)-branded devices, a portion of every iPhone (RED) sale will be donated to The Global Fund, a charitable organization that finances HIV/AIDS grants to roughly half a dozen countries in sub-Saharan Africa. “This is the biggest day in our 10-year partnership, (RED) CEO Deb Dugan told Mashable. “[We’ve] seen from the time we’ve begun with Apple that more than 18 million people have effective treatment. Having Apple make this very big statement, it takes our breath away.” Our first look at the red hot iPhone The iPhone (RED) is officially available in Apple Stores, so we stopped by to see what the fuss is all about. Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends What’s clear is Apple needs to make more iPhone colors — the iPhone (RED) is drop-dead gorgeous. The matte, ruby red finish on the back attracts the eye, but hardly any fingerprints. The Product (RED) logo sits below the iPhone, and the antennas around the phone blend in more so it looks a little sleeker than the other colors. Apart from that, you should expect the same build quality and style of the iPhone 7. The only downside is that Apple did not make the front red like the back. Instead, you get a white front along with a silver accented home button. The iPhone (RED) is another notch in Apple’s belt in its fight against HIV and AIDS. The iPhone maker has made a tradition of marking World AIDS Day with a campaign to donate to Product (RED), and in 2012, it teamed up with Starbucks to offer a special iTunes eBasket that saw 5 percent of proceeds donated to The Global Fund. Availbility and pricing The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus Special Edition (RED) is now available online and in stores. The design is the only difference between the Product (RED) phones and the current iPhone 7 and 7 Plus devices  — functionally speaking, they’re the same. More: Apple iPhone 7 Plus review Here’s how the pricing breaks down: iPhone 7 128 GB:  $750 iPhone 7 256 GB: $850 iPhone 7 Plus 128 GB: $870 iPhone 7 Plus 256 GB: $970 Apple said the percentage of each sale that goes to Product (RED) varies by channel, but historically, the iPhone maker has been one of the charity’s biggest contributors. It has donated $130 million to the cause thus far — an amount that’s more than many countries have contributed, according to Dugan. Apple will try to inform potential buyers about Product (RED)’s mission through posters, pamphlets, and other promotional materials. Controversy in China There was some initial blowback to the iPhone (RED) in China — about how the announcement and product page on Apple’s Chinese site are completely devoid of Product (RED) branding. The limited-edition model is slated to land in more than 40 countries in April, and while China is one of them, it appears that Apple made the change to avoid pushback over what is a murky, taboo subject in the country. The omission is even more strange considering Apple China pledged its support to Product (RED) late last year, as pointed out by Engadget China’s editor-in-chief, Richard Lai, on Twitter. The company’s Taiwan site retained the branding, which indicates there’s more than a language problem at work here. Apple CEO Tim Cook confirmed to MacRumors that the company “will donate to the Global Fund on every iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus [sold] in every country in the world.” Apparently, even though the name has been scrubbed, sales of the limited-edition iPhone in China will continue to benefit the charity. This article was originally published on 03-21-2017. Updated on 03-24-2017 by Julian Chokkattu: Added hands-on images of the iPhone (RED).

By India Ashok March 26, 2017 06:14 BST Apple Inc's CEO Tim Cook (3rd L) reacts next to China Mobile Ltd's Chairman Xi Guohua (3rd R) at an event celebrating the launch of Apple's iPhone on China Mobile's network at a China Mobile shop in Beijing on 17, January, 2014REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon Apple has reportedly just landed a major victory in a patent dispute case that prevented the firm from selling iPhones in China. However, a Chinese court reportedly found in favour of Apple, effectively overturning a ban on iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus sales. In May 2016, a Beijing patent regulator had ordered Apple's Chinese subsidiary and a local retailer Zoomflight to halt its iPhone sales, after Shenzhen Baili Marketing Services lodged a complaint alleging that Apple had infringed on the patent design for its mobile phone 100c, Reuters reported. Both Apple and Zoomflight took the ban to court. On Friday (24 March), The Beijing Intellectual Property Court overturned the ban, finding that neither Apple nor Zoomflight violated Shenzhen Baili's design patent for 100c phones. The court also ruled that the patent regulator had failed to follow proper procedures in ordering the iPhone sales ban, given that there was not enough proof to back up Shenzhen Baili's claim that the designs constituted a violation of intellectual property rights. In a related ruling, however, the same court denied Apple's request to strip Shenzhen Baili of its design patent for 100c phones, according to a report by the Xinhua news agency. Apple reportedly first made a request to China's Patent Reexamination Board of State Intellectual Property Office, but the board rejected the tech firm's request. It was then that Apple took the matter to court. Meanwhile, Apple is reportedly considering starting manufacturing iPhone 6 and 6S models in India.

Xiaomi has launched the Redmi 4A in India at Rs. 5,999, the latest model in the company's low-cost, entry-level smartphone series. Sporting a polycarbonate body, the dual-SIM Xiaomi Redmi 4A runs MIUI 8 based on Android 6.0 Marshmallow. The Redmi 4A sports a 5-inch 720x1280 pixels display, and powered by a 1.4GHz quad-core processor and 2GB of RAM. Along with the Redmi 4A India launch, the company teased that the launch of the Xiaomi Redmi 4 and Xiaomi Redmi 4 Prime in the country is imminent. Xiaomi Redmi 4A customers on Idea will get 1GB data per day, with a RS. 343 recharge, and after the launch, the phone went on sale on Thursday. Xiaomi said that the first sale of the phone sold 250,000 units in four minutes, on Amazon India and Mi.com. Xiaomi Redmi 4A Review   That's just one of the news highlights from this week though - keep reading to know what else has been happening. Xiaomi Announces Second Manufacturing Unit in India, Boosts Production Capacity As predicted, iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus red variants have been launched by Apple, officially called the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus (PRODUCT)RED. These red coloured iPhones have been launched in India as well, with prices same as other iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus models of the same capacity. Apple Unveils New 9.7-Inch iPad, Cheapest Full-Sized iPad Yet Apple has also doubled the storage capacities on the two iPhone SE variants - from 16GB and 64GB, to 32GB and 128GB respectively while retaining their price tags in the US, with prices starting at Rs. 27,200 (MRP).  iPhone 7 RED, iPhone SE, iPad Lineup India Prices Revealed  Apart from that, on Thursday we saw the launch of the Oppo F3 Plus (Review), which has a dual-selfie camera. The phone was launched at an event in New Delhi, but it will go on sale from April 1. Preorders have begun however, and will continue until March 31. The highlight of the Oppo F3 Plus is its dual-selfie camera, which has one 16-megapixel and one 8-megapixel sensor. Users can choose which lens they want to use, and, the smartphone comes with a Smart Facial Recognition feature that Oppo says automatically suggests which lens is ideal. Oppo F3 Plus Review   Google meanwhile launched the newest version of Android, as a developer preview. Android O Developer Preview 1 has been released for developers and device makers and brings in a lot of new features, such as background limits, notification channels, standard autofill APIs, picture-in-picture video, adaptive icons, as well as support for multi-display. Top New Android O Features While not all Android O features have been revealed with the developer preview, this does give us an idea at what Google is focussing at with the next major build of its mobile OS. For one, it's bringing tighter control over battery usage, and notification channels would give developers more control over the type of notification content. Adaptive icons can display various shapes, and animate interactions with icons. Other changes include improved keyboard navigation, and picture-in-picture mode.   On the international front, there was one development that many were not expecting. At the start of the week, the US issued a ban on certain electronic items in the cabin on flights from the Middle East. A day later a similar ban was issued by the UK, which came into effect from Saturday. No US carriers are affected, but the ban hits passengers on approximately 50 flights per day from the busiest hubs in the Arab world and the three Gulf carriers that recently emerged as giants: Emirates, Etihad, and Qatar Airways.  Laptops, Tablets on Aeroplanes: What's the Threat? Reaction from the affected airports' host governments was generally low-key, and Emirates turned the situation into a light-hearted ad extolling the strengths of its in-flight entertainment, entitled: "Who needs a laptop?" But one government, Turkey, denounced the order and demanded that it be rescinded or scaled back. Laptop Ban: Emirates Offers Complimentary Electronics Handling Facility  There were also a number of smartphone launches through the week. The Intex Aqua 4G Mini has been made available in black and red colour variants. The budget smartphone comes with VoLTE support and is priced at Rs. 4,199. It packs a 5-megapixel rear camera, a 1.3Ghz quad-core processor, 512MB of RAM, and a 1450mAh battery. After launching the Vdeo 3 and Vdeo 4 smartphones in India, Micromax has further expanded the Vdeo series to launch the Micromax Spark Vdeo smartphone. Like other phones in the Vdeo series, this comes with Google Duo preloaded, and is priced at Rs. 4,499.   We also saw the launch of the Zen Admire Swadesh, with support for 22 Indian languages, 4G VoLTE support, priced at Rs. 4,990, and the Karbonn Aura Sleek 4G, which launched at Rs. 5,290. Aside from these, we also saw a couple of [mid-range launches from Lava - the Lava Z10 and the Lava Z25, priced at Rs. 11,500 and Rs. 18,000, respectively. The LG Stylus 3 rounds this out priced at Rs. 18,500, with an HD display, 16GB storage, a 1.5GHz processor and 3GB of RAM. Lava Z25 vs Lava Z10: All You Need to Know  In China, the Nubia M2, Nubia M2 Lite, and Nubia N2 smartphones were launched. The M2 and M2 Lite, which have been priced starting at CNY 2,699 (roughly Rs. 27,000) and CNY 1,799 (roughly Rs. 18,000) respectively will be available soon, while the Nubia N2, which has been priced at CNY 1,999 (roughly Rs. 19,000), will be available from April 8. And in Taiwan, Panasonic has now launched the Eluga Pure. The budget device is only available in Taiwan for now, and is priced at TWD 4,990 (roughly Rs. 10,700). Samsung Galaxy S8 Release Date, Specifications, Price, and More: What the Rumours Say   Apart from the launches, there was also a leak about the Samsung Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+. The two phones are set to launch in under a week, and a new leaked teaser hints at features such as iris scanning, and also a look at the retail box. Meanwhile, Samsung Pay has been officially launched in India - you can now save your credit and debit cards to select Samsung phones, and use them to pay at any card terminal, not just updated NFC terminals. India may soon issue chip-enabled passports with high security features, as the government has given approval for procurement of electronic contactless inlays for manufacturing of e-passports. However, this week also included news of a major data leak from the government. A simple Google search revealed a lot of personal data, including peoples' full names, parents names, birthdates, bank account numbers and IFSC codes. These were some of the most noteworthy developments that took place this week. Tell us what you think about all this via the comments.

The new Nokia and BlackBerry phones shown at Mobile World Congress rely heavily on nostalgia and are aimed at niche markets; will that be enough to pull customers away from Apple, Samsung and the other big makers? PUBLISHED : Sunday, 26 March, 2017, 8:32am UPDATED : Sunday, 26 March, 2017, 8:32am Comments:   Ben Sin ben.sin@scmp.com Share PrintEmail Related topics Nokia Smartphones BlackBerry Related Articles Lifestyle Promise of 5G future dominates Mobile World Congress in Barcelona 4 Mar 2017 Tech New Nokia 6 unlikely to be a hit in China 12 Jan 2017 Apps & Gaming Nokia invests in women’s menstrual cycle tracking app 30 Nov 2016 It’s hard to imagine now, with the Apple iPhone and the array of Samsung models around the globe, that there once was a time when Nokia and BlackBerry were kings of the mobile phone industry. Finnish company Nokia made some of the first mobile phones in the 1980s, helped these devices become household items in the early 2000s, and by 2007, had a whopping 41 per cent of the mobile handset market. Meanwhile, BlackBerry, the brainchild of Canadian company Research in Motion, dominated the enterprise market, becoming a status symbol among working professionals. At its peak in 2009, it made an annual profit of US$2 billion and had a 20 per cent market share. We all know what happened next. Neither company took the iPhone, with its iOS platform, seriously when it was introduced in 2007, and within five years their kingdoms had fallen to the iPhone and phones using Google’s Android. The indestructible Nokia 3310 is back, complete with Snake, retro styling and epic battery life By the time Nokia and BlackBerry stopped making phones, in 2014 and 2016 respectively (the former was first sold to Microsoft and later passed to Finnish start-up HMD Global, while BlackBerry became the property of Chinese company TCL), the brands had been irrelevant for so long, no one but the most hardcore of mobile geeks cared – and even that was out of pure nostalgia. And so, when new BlackBerry and Nokia handsets were announced at this year’s Mobile World Congress, neither fans of the brands nor the media were sure what to expect. After all, both brands crashed and burned badly due to their repeated inability to understand mobile trends in the early 2010s, and the industry has only become more competitive since then, so can they make a real splash? Not at the highest level, no. No one can objectively say the five new handsets (four Nokias and one from BlackBerry) introduced at the Mobile World Congress are going to do much damage to Samsung and Apple phone sales – not with their modest specs and solid but unspectacular hardware – but all five phones do have specific features that cater to niche audiences. Plus, nostalgia is a powerful emotion, and both brands are designed to conjure up plenty of that among fans. BlackBerry’s KEYOne, for example, is a clear continuation of the once mighty portable work machines, a mostly black aluminium device with a physical keyboard attached to a modest 4.5-inch 1080P display. The problem is that few consumers today are clamouring for a physical keyboard, and the KEYone also runs on an underpowered Snapdragon 625 processor – a far cry from the Snapdragon 835 that will feature in Samsung’s Galaxy S8. TCL’s chief executive officer, Nicolas Zibell, says in defence: “We must stop thinking of the smartphone user experience as being driven by chipset power alone. In the same way that automobile makers select a certain engine to be optimised for an overall experience in a vehicle, the processor in a smartphone must be taken into context with the overall design and user value proposition.” HMD Global, meanwhile, introduced three new Nokia-branded devices running pure stock Android (which is usually only available on Google’s own line of phones, since brands such as Samsung and Huawei put their own software on top of Android), and a fourth device that drew most of the attention: an “updated” version of the iconic Nokia 3310. “Nokia has much brand equity and emotional resonance,” says Pekka Rantala, a former Nokia executive and now HMD Global’s chief mobile marketing officer, pointing out that the Nokia was likely the first mobile phone for many consumers. The market demands more than just a one-size-fits-all solution Nicolas Zibell He says the response to the 3310 has been “tremendous”. No one is denying the retro gadget is fun to look at and play with, but the device – true to its original roots – can only make phone calls, send SMS messages and play the mobile game “Snake”. You can’t go on Facebook and you can’t send e-mails. That doesn’t sound like a phone that many will actually want to use in a real-world situation. Rantala, of course, spins it like this: “The new 3310 is a great weekend phone for those who want to detox from social media.” At least the new Nokia smartphones get the software (stock Android) right. Rantala says HMD Global’s goal going forward is to release “well crafted” smartphones that work closely with Google to provide the most up-to-date software, security updates, and Google services. “We will work closely with Google to align our phones with their vision,” he says, “because Google services are the best services.” But here’s the thing: HMD Global is also aiming at the Chinese market – the Nokia 6, the new release with the best specs, was actually introduced in China before the Mobile World Congress – where Google services are banned. So how is HMD Global going to market Nokia phones as devices with the best Google apps when none of them can get over the Great Firewall? “I don’t have an answer for your question,” Rantala says. “But I believe that our partnership with Google opens up the opportunity to perhaps work things out with China.” Nokia’s comeback phone in China gets a collective yawn from buyers That’s a pipe dream. Chinese consumers are likely to stick with cheap local brands like Xiaomi, or “premium” phones from Huawei or Apple, rather than pay mid-tier prices for a Nokia or BlackBerry. A more realistic scenario for both brands is to appeal to the niche and emerging markets. According to research firm IDC, a disproportionate number of people in Indonesia are still using the long-abandoned BBM (BlackBerry Messenger) service, a fact Zibell is keen to explore. “The market demands more than just a one-size-fits-all solution,” he says. Why a BlackBerry needs a keyboard - head of China’s TCL talks up new smartphone at CES 2017 tech show Another senior BlackBerry executive concedes the brand doesn’t have lofty goals for now. Speaking to TechCrunch at the Mobile World Congress, BlackBerry’s mobile division general manager Bruce Walpole said if even one in eight consumers pick up the new BlackBerry, the company would be satisfied. Perhaps having the backing of a billion-dollar Chinese conglomerate (TCL owns another phone brand, Alcatel, and also makes smart televisions) takes a lot of pressure off the brand. HMD Global, however, doesn’t have that luxury. The company is small compared with other phone makers, and put together by a group of Finns. To them, the success of the Nokia brand isn’t just about making money or even restoring Nokia’s legacy, it’s about bringing pride back to the country. “Nokia was once the pride and joy of Finland,” Rantala says. “We want to bring the brand back to show the world why Finland was once the mobile capital of the world.” The early response to the classic Nokia 3310 has been strong (less so for the other models).

Last May, a Beijing patent regulator ordered Apple's Chinese subsidiary and a local retailer Zoomflight to stop selling the iPhones after Shenzhen Baili Marketing Services lodged a complaint, claiming that the patent for the design of its mobile phone 100c was being infringed by the iPhone sales. Apple and Zoomflight took the Beijing Intellectual Property Office's ban to court. The Beijing Intellectual Property Court on Friday revoked the ban, saying Apple and Zoomflight did not violate Shenzhen Baili's design patent for 100c phones. The court ruled that the regulator did not follow due procedures in ordering the ban while there was no sufficient proof to claim the designs constituted a violation of intellectual property rights. Representatives of Beijing Intellectual Property Office and Shenzhen Baili said they would take time to decide whether to appeal the ruling, according to Xinhua. In a related ruling, the same court denied a request by Apple to demand stripping Shenzhen Baili of its design patent for 100c phones. Apple first filed the request to the Patent Reexamination Board of State Intellectual Property Office. The board rejected the request, but Apple lodged a lawsuit against the rejection. The Beijing Intellectual Property Court on Friday ruled to maintain the board's decision. It is unclear if Apple will appeal.

The most recent patent appears to err on the more conventional side of design, proffering a contraption that combines a phone or tablet with a notebook "shell". Filed in late September of last year, the patent only recently made its way into the public record. While reminiscent of ASUS' Padfone, Apple's patent describes a somewhat different device. Essentially, it's a notebook chassis that can accept either a phone, which becomes a high-tech trackpad, or a tablet that acts as a touchscreen. The patent explains the gizmo thusly: An electronic accessory device, comprising: an operational component that provides an output to a user; a housing carrying the operational component, the housing having a recess; and a control interface coupled to the operational component and configured to receive a control signal from an electronic host device when the electronic host device is positioned within the recess and coupled to the control interface, wherein the electronic accessory device is inoperable without the electronic host device being coupled to the control interface. In case anyone is confused by how exactly said gadgets would be attached to the chassis (described as an "electronic accessory device"), here's a helpful diagram. Image: Apple / USPTO The completed computer is called a "cooperative electronic assembly" and would, in essence, act like a notebook, with the phone or tablet providing the processing grunt. However, the patent also allows for the chassis to house its own "extended functionality": In various embodiments, the electronic accessory device can be considered a "thin" device, in that it extends the functionality of another device but is inoperable by itself as a stand-alone device. As such, the accessory device can have little or no independent processing resources in the form of a CPU or similar comprehensive processor. The accessory device, however, can provide auxiliary processing resources, such a graphical processing unit, or GPU, or other processing resources that can support the functions of the portable computing device. Whether or not Apple actually puts the patent to use is up for debate, but if it was looking for a way to more tightly integrate its portable gadget and computer businesses, this is certainly one way to go about it.

Homepage Sign in / Sign up Frederic JacobsBlockedUnblockFollowFollowing Security Researcher Sep 24, 2015 Why I’m not enabling Bitcode Thoughts on application binaries packaging and software distribution At Apple’s annual WWDC developer event, the compiler infrastructure team unveiled “Bitcode” and recommended iOS developers to opt-in , even requiring it for Apple Watch applications. The Problem with fat archives Multi-architecture iOS (and OS X) executables are packaged in fat archives. The fat format (not to same as the filesystem) is quite simple: the application binaries contain headers describing the scope of the instructions for a given infrastructure. Fat headers of a binary can be looked up by running: otool -f binaryName In the following screenshot, we can see that Signal Private Messenger is compiled for the two following architectures: - armv7: ARM has CPU type 12, armv7 is CPU subtype 9. (The armv7-specific instructions start at offset 16384 and go on for the next 5306144 bytes.) - arm64: CPU type 16777228, the ARM 64-bit CPU type. 64-bit instructions start at offset 5324800 and have length of 6457600 bytes. Screenshot from running the ‘otool’ command Note: The FAT_MAGIC value `0xCAFEBABE` indicates what kind of archive it is. Different flags are defined for big/little-endian & 32/64 bit configurations. macho.h from Apple’s Open Source page As we can see, adding architectures come at a significant storage cost. Apple has regularly updated the underlying ARM processor architectures of their series A SoCs. iOS Support Matrix. Each color represents a different processor architecture. Source It is fairly common for Apple to continue delivering operating system updates for devices that are more than four years old. For instance, the iPhone 4S, released in 2011, still gets an iOS 9 update. iOS developers also build their apps to be able to run on multiple older versions of iOS and therefore have to support sometimes even more architectures. In addition, Apple has started releasing multiple iPhone models per year powered by different architectures. iPhones are not the only devices running these apps: the same binaries can be executed on iPads too. And since recently, iPhone app bundles are shipping with WatchOS binaries too. All of this results in application binaries becoming substantially larger as time goes by. Applications are built for all architectures, but only one is required on a specific device. So, why not just distribute the binary for the device’s architecture? Apple introduced exactly that with App Thinning. App Thinning Slicing is the process of creating and delivering variants of the app bundle for different target devices. A variant contains only the executable architecture and resources that are needed for the target device. You continue to develop and upload full versions of your app to iTunes Connect. Source: App Thinning — Apple Developer Documentation Slicing looks great. It not only strips away unused executable architectures, but also deals away with resources that won’t be used based on your screen resolution or size, such as images and icons. Great! Binary size growth is no more an issue, but what about new architectures? What stripped architecture should Apple serve them? That’s where Bitcode comes in. Bitcode Bitcode isn’t actually anything new. It’s been around in the LLVM project for some time now. Let’s review the compilation process. The most popular design for a traditional static compiler (like most C compilers) is the three phase design whose major components are the front end, the optimizer and the back end. The front end parses source code, checking it for errors, and builds a language-specific Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to represent the input code. The AST is optionally converted to a new representation for optimization, and the optimizer and back end are run on the code. The optimizer is responsible for doing a broad variety of transformations to try to improve the code’s running time, such as eliminating redundant computations, and is usually more or less independent of language and target. The back end (also known as the code generator) then maps the code onto the target instruction set. In addition to making correct code, it is responsible for generating goodcode that takes advantage of unusual features of the supported architecture. Common parts of a compiler back end include instruction selection, register allocation, and instruction scheduling. LLVM three stages compilation The most important win of this classical design comes when a compiler decides to support multiple source languages or target architectures. If the compiler uses a common code representation in its optimizer, then a front end can be written for any language that can compile to it, and a back end can be written for any target that can compile from it. Source: LLVM’s Chris Lattner Intro to LLVM The front-end produces LLVM “bytecode” (LLVM Intermediate Representation) for a virtual machine, that is later optimized and mapped to native instruction sets. Bitcode is simply a bitstream of LLVM IR. With iOS 9, Apple wants developers to upload LLVM Bitcode to iTunes Connect (the App Store’s backend). Apple would then optimize the LLVM IR and generate the binaries for each platform. In practice, the LLVM Bitcode is compressed and packed into the Mach-O binary that is uploaded to iTunes. If you’re curious about how Bitcode is packed into application binaries when uploaded to the App Store, I suggest you the following article: Bitcode Demystified Few months ago Apple announced a 'new feature', called 'Bitcode'. In this article I'll try to answer the questions like…lowlevelbits.org Is LLVM-IR really platform independent? Even though the three stages compilation infrastructure appeared to be designed to be platform independent. It appears to be very different in practice. In a lengthy write-up in 2011 on the LLVM-dev mailing list, (ex-)Apple engineer Dan Gohman argued about why IR would be “a poor system for building a Platform, any system where LLVM IR would be a format in which programs are stored or transmitted for subsequent use on multiple underlying architectures”. However, there are several ways in which LLVM IR differs from actual platforms, both high-level VMs like Java or .NET and actual low-level ISAs like x86 or ARM. First, the boundaries of what capabilities LLVM provides are nebulous. LLVM IR contains:  * Explicitly Target-specific features. These aren't secret;    x86_fp80's reason for being is pretty clear.  * Target-specific ABI code. In order to interoperate with native    C ABIs, LLVM requires front-ends to emit target-specific IR.    Pretty much everyone around here has run into this.  * Implicitly Target-specific features. The most obvious examples of    these are all the different Linkage kinds. These are all basically    just gateways to features in real linkers, and real linkers vary    quite a lot. LLVM has its own IR-level Linker, but it doesn't    do all the stuff that native linkers do.  * Target-specific limitations in seemingly portable features.    How big can the alignment be on an alloca? Or a GlobalVariable?    What's the widest supported integer type? LLVM's various backends    all have different answers to questions like these. Even ignoring the fact that the quality of the backends in the LLVM source tree varies widely, the question of "What can LLVM IR do?" has numerous backend-specific facets. This can be problematic for producers as well as consumers. Second, and more fundamentally, LLVM IR is a fundamentally vague language. It has:  * Undefined Behavior. LLVM is, at its heart, a C compiler, and    Undefined Behavior is one of its cornerstones.    High-level VMs typically raise predictable exceptions when they    encounter program errors. Physical machines typically document    their behavior very extensively. LLVM is fundamentally different    from both: it presents a bunch of rules to follow and then offers    no description of what happens if you break them.    LLVM's optimizers are built on the assumption that the rules    are never broken, so when rules do get broken, the code just    goes off the rails and runs into whatever happens to be in    the way. Sometimes it crashes loudly. Sometimes it silently    corrupts data and keeps running.    There are some tools that can help locate violations of the    rules. Valgrind is a very useful tool. But they can't find    everything. There are even some kinds of undefined behavior that    I've never heard anyone even propose a method of detection for.  * Intentional vagueness. There is a strong preference for defining    LLVM IR semantics intuitively rather than formally. This is quite    practical; formalizing a language is a lot of work, it reduces    future flexibility, and it tends to draw attention to troublesome    edge cases which could otherwise be largely ignored.    I've done work to try to formalize parts of LLVM IR, and the    results have been largely fruitless. I got bogged down in    edge cases that no one is interested in fixing.  * Floating-point arithmetic is not always consistent. Some backends    don't fully implement IEEE-754 arithmetic rules even without    -ffast-math and friends, to get better performance. If you're familiar with "write once, debug everywhere" in Java, consider the situation in LLVM IR, which is fundamentally opposed to even trying to provide that level of consistency. And if you allow the optimizer to do subtarget-specific optimizations, you increase the chances that some bit of undefined behavior or vagueness will be exposed. Third, LLVM is a low level system that doesn't represent high-level abstractions natively. It forces them to be chopped up into lots of small low-level instructions.  * It makes LLVM's Interpreter really slow. The amount of work    performed by each instruction is relatively small, so the interpreter    has to execute a relatively large number of instructions to do simple    tasks, such as virtual method calls. Languages built for interpretation    do more with fewer instructions, and have lower per-instruction    overhead.  * Similarly, it makes really-fast JITing hard. LLVM is fast compared    to some other static C compilers, but it's not fast compared to    real JIT compilers. Compiling one LLVM IR level instruction at a    time can be relatively simple, ignoring the weird stuff, but this    approach generates comically bad code. Fixing this requires    recognizing patterns in groups of instructions, and then emitting    code for the patterns. This works, but it's more involved.  * Lowering high-level language features into low-level code locks    in implementation details. This is less severe in native code,    because a compiled blob is limited to a single hardware platform    as well. But a platform which advertizes architecture independence    which still has all the ABI lock-in of HLL implementation details    presents a much more frightening backwards compatibility specter.  * Apple has some LLVM IR transformations for Objective-C, however    the transformations have to reverse-engineer the high-level semantics    out of the lowered code, which is awkward. Further, they're    reasoning about high-level semantics in a way that isn't guaranteed    to be safe by LLVM IR rules alone. It works for the kinds of code    clang generates for Objective C, but it wouldn't necessarily be    correct if run on code produced by other front-ends. LLVM IR    isn't capable of representing the necessary semantics for this    unless we start embedding Objective C into it. Chris Lattner, primary author of the LLVM project and now director of the developer tools at Apple responded: I agree with almost all of the points you make, but not your conclusion. Many of the issues that you point out as problems are actually “features” that a VM like Java doesn’t provide. For example, Java doesn’t have uninitialized variables on the stack, and LLVM does. LLVM is capable of expressing the implicit zero initialization of variables that is implicit in Java, it just leaves the choice to the frontend. Many of the other issues that you raise are true, but irrelevant when compared to other VMs. For example, LLVM allows a frontend to produce code that is ABI compatible with native C ABIs. It does this by requiring the frontend to know a lot about the native C ABI. Java doesn’t permit this at all, and so LLVM having “this feature” seems like a feature over-and-above what high-level VMs provide. Similiarly, the “conditionally” supported features like large and obscurely sized integers simply don’t exist in these VMs. […] It isn’t LLVM’s fault that people want LLVM to magically solve all of C’s portability problems. It’s clear that nobody claims that LLVM IR is actually portable. Once the LLVM-IR has been generated from a specific front-end, you can’t just plug another backend and hope that your application will just work. This exchange being from 2011, has anything changed since? I compiled a simple App with Bitcode to see. You can find the AppDelegate.m and the associated LLVM-IR in the following Gist. Unsurprisingly, the IR is highly dependent on a specific target (casts, word sizes …). Bitcode will enable support for better microarchitecture support but gets nowhere close to target independence. Applications compiled for the armv7 target could still run on armv7s devices but additional optimisations make applications faster if they contain a armv7s slice. The advantage that Bitcode provides on top of app thinning is negligible in my opinion since it will only provide a slight speed up until the developer uploads a new build with the optimized slice. Security Implications Now that we know what Bitcode actually does, let’s review the security implications. Compiler Optimizations Correctness Compiler optimizations correctness is nothing new and of course it also applies to programs not distributed with Bitcode. But usually, the developer of the application has complete control on what types of optimizations will be performed and on what files these should be applied. Bitcode doesn’t provide any fine-grained control over this. Apple does not provide any documentation or sample configuration of what optimizations are applied on the LLVM-IR. It acts like a black-box, and you can’t reproduce the output locally as far as I know. Compiler optimizations correctness has been studied for a long time. A recent paper by Vijay D’Silva, Mathias Payer and Dawn Song presented at LangSec 2015, analyses optimizations from a security perspective. Here are a few examples of what could go wrong: information leaks through persistent state. A compiler optimization that manipulates security critical code may cause information about a secure computation to persist in memory thereby introducing a persistent state violation. Examples: Dead Store Elimination, Function Call Inlining, Code Motion elimination of security-relevant code due to undefined behavior The term undefined behavior refers to situation in which the behavior of a program is not specified. Language specifications deliberately underspecify the semantics of some operations for various reasons such as to allow working around hardware restrictions or to create optimization opportunities. Examples of undefined behavior in C are using an uninitialized variable, dividing by zero, or operations that trigger overflows. introduction of side channels A side channel leaks information about the state of the system. Side channel attacks allow an attacker external to the system to observe the internal state of a computation without direct access to the internal state. We say that a side channel violation occurs if optimized code is susceptible to a side channel attack but the source code is not. Examples: Common Subexpression Elimination, Strength Reduction, Peephole Optimizations All of these bugs are bad. With cryptographic implementations in mind, all of these represent important vulnerabilities. From key leakage to timing attacks via fault attacks, a lot of things can go wrong. No Inline Assembly It is quite frequent for performance or security sensitive applications to include inline assembly. Cryptographic implementations are often written directly in assembly to prevent any unwanted compiler optimizations and be able to optimize operations tailored to the algorithm’s requirements. With Bitcode, developers can’t use inline assembly anymore. It not only affects cryptographic applications, VLC media player uses inline assembly to speed up some graphical operations. Compiler trust In his 1984 Turing Award Lecture “Reflections on trusting trust”, Ken Thompson describes how compilers can be used to inject trojans. Extract from Ken Thompson’s Turing Award Lecture An interesting example of the inherent trust issue in compilers has been doing rounds recently with the detection of XcodeGhost, a modified version of Xcode that reportedly infected millions of users. It is already difficult to trust compilers. LLVM being open-source and reviewable makes it easier to trust than a blackbox. But that doesn’t entirely solve the problem since you will need a compiler binary to compile your compiler. The centralization of the building and signing process is what worries me: an adversary could find a vulnerability in the LLVM backend to obtain remote code execution on Apple’s Bitcode compilation infrastructure to inject a compiler trojan that would affect every single app on the App Store that was submitted with Bitcode. Potential for backdoor injection Compromising Apple’s infrastructure isn’t the only way to backdoor iOS apps in that setting. Since Apple is going to centralize the process of building application binaries, it will become really appealing to governments desiring to get “lawful” access to application content, circumventing any kind of encryption, no matter how strong it is. An article published today by the Washington Post explains how the Obama administration working group has been working on compelling phone manufacturers or App Store services to provide a way to insert a backdoor on the device. The second approach would exploit companies’ automatic software updates. Under a court order, the company could insert spyware onto targeted customers’ phones or tablets — essentially hacking the device. Adding backdoors to Bitcode applications becomes easier than ever. Apple has your application’s IR (easier to decompile than binary) with all the associated symbols and will recompile your app. This is not a new capability. Of course, you can ‘easily’ do it on current binaries too. But the issue is that Apple will compile your code, and you don’t get to see the resulting binary. Verifiability There is currently no easy way of verifying (save with a jailbroken iPhone) that an application on the App Store is the one you uploaded as a developer. And I’m not even talking about reproducible builds, which consist of reproducing the same binary from a given source code. The biggest pain point up to now for verifiable and reproducible builds was FairPlay, Apple’s DRM applied to applications. App Store binaries are encrypted (with a key that even the app’s developer doesn’t have). Hence, they have to be decrypted before being able to analyze with binary analysis tools such as Hopper, IDA … FairPlay encryption already made it really difficult for developers to make sure that Apple distributes the build you think they are distributing. But at least, with jailbroken iPhone, I’m currently able to get some idea of what the binary I’m distributing looks like and compare it to the one I submitted to Apple. With Bitcode builds, this becomes significantly harder. Since I can’t reproduce a target binary since I don’t know what optimizations Apple is performing on my binaries, I can’t ‘diff’ them to find possibly altered parts. I have to analyze the entire binary to figure out that nothing nasty is going on. It became so bad that some developers weren’t even able to symbolicate the crash logs of their own applications since binaries were built on the server and Apple was failing to provide the symbolication files (dSYM). Conclusions App thinning solves the binary size problem that I understand needed to be solved. The potential performance improvements during a short time period on new microarchitectures isn’t outbalancing all of the issues I cited in this post. It might be a different deal for you, but I strongly think it’s unwise for any developer who cares about security.

At the time, Apple CEO Tim Cook predictably referred to the new devices as the best handsets the company has ever created, and said that they had a "gorgeous new design". Today, the company is adding to its range with a striking new red option for the two handsets, paired with a white front on each device. The new color is the latest device to emerge from Apple's long-standing partnership with the (RED) alliance that raises funds to help combat the spread and effects of HIV/AIDS in Africa. Cook said today: Since we began working with (RED) 10 years ago, our customers have made a significant impact in fighting the spread of AIDS through the purchase of our products, from the original iPod nano (PRODUCT)RED Special Edition all the way to today’s lineup of Beats products and accessories for iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch. The introduction of this special edition iPhone in a gorgeous red finish is our biggest (PRODUCT)RED offering to date in celebration of our partnership with (RED), and we can’t wait to get it into customers’ hands. Apple is the largest donor to (RED)'s Global Fund, having contributed over $130 million through sales of its products, according to (RED) CEO Deborah Dugan. The new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus (PRODUCT)RED Special Edition will be available with either 128GB or 256GB of storage, with prices starting from $749 USD. The new models are technically identical to the versions that it unveiled last year, and which remain on sale alongside the new (RED) editions. Both models will be available from March 24, and will begin shipping by the end of March to customers in the US and over 40 other markets, with other countries to follow in April. Other (PRODUCT)RED items in Apple's range include iPods, along with Beats Solo 3 Wireless On-Ear Headphones, the Beats Pill+ Portable Speaker, the iPhone 7 Smart Battery Case, and various accessories for iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch.

Republic Records estimates Drake’s latest project to have around 600 million streams worldwide. Drake’s More Life has already surpassed his previous album, Views, in the first week of its release. Apple Music told The Verge that Drake’s Views got around 250 million streams in its first week in 2016. 2 shows left.???? A post shared by champagnepapi (@champagnepapi) on Mar 25, 2017 at 3:15pm PDT Ed Sheeran still holds the title for the biggest first week for any album on a single service with his release of Divide, which streamed 375 million times on Spotify in its first week. Drake’s More Life did set a record for Apple. The playlist had 89.9 million streams in its first 24 hours on Apple’s streaming service, which is over 33 million streams ahead of Divide. A post shared by champagnepapi (@champagnepapi) on Mar 20, 2017 at 8:15pm PDT The Apple Music Team dedicated the success of More Life to the power of Beats 1 and OVO Sound Radio. Drake has shown his loyalty to Apple Music since the app launched in 2015. The rapper launched a series of exclusive songs and albums though Apple Music and on OVO Sound Radio. Drake’s co-manager, Oliver El-Khatib, hosts the More Life debut on the most recent episode, which airs on Beats 1. ???? A post shared by champagnepapi (@champagnepapi) on Mar 18, 2017 at 6:57pm PDT Larry Jackson, the head of Apple Music’s content, recalled how successful Drake’s releases of “Hotline Bling” and “Back To Back” were when they debuted on OVO Sound Radio in July of 2015. “It’s the biggest radio station in the world. There’s no way you’re going to find another station that has as many concurrent listeners and audience-wise as Beats 1.” The head of Beats 1, Zane Lowe, commented that Drake doesn’t rush his work and that has helped him to chill out a bit. “I mean what he’s taught me just in terms of the parameters of broadcasting is remarkable. I remember when we were first waiting for those shows to come in [OVO Sound Radio] and they’d come in 20 minutes late, and I’d be freaking out because we’d run over our start time. Now the show comes in an hour late and we’re all just like cool.” Lowe continued to say that Drake totally knew “what he’s doing” and that he definitely knew his audience. “The best thing that anyone — including myself — can do is get out of the way.” Drake is probably one of the most notable names in the music industry right now, and Lowe said the rapper is defining the era. @therealdennisg A post shared by champagnepapi (@champagnepapi) on Mar 20, 2017 at 7:41am PDT “If you’re going to have an era or moment where you can look back and say that the experience got better, or the music sounded better, or we shifted gears into new technology and made it work, it has to be spearheaded by the artist, always. “If you look back at any great era, it’s always one or two artists that got it, and embraced it and took it and made it their own, and that’s how they owned that era. Drake has done that, and his camp have done that, and that’s why it’s such an exciting time.” Apple Music has been successful due to the fact that they are able to capitalize on the app’s ability to debut albums live across the globe. However, More Life was actually not an Apple Music exclusive. “We didn’t have Drake’s album exclusive, but it was fantastic what worked out. “Whoever has a great idea we like to follow it and execute it. [Drake] had the idea, we kind of just built and supported around him.” MORE A post shared by champagnepapi (@champagnepapi) on Mar 19, 2017 at 10:53pm PDT The executives at Apple Music told The Verge that their key to success has been working with artists like Drake to ensure that the company stays ahead of the game. “These [streaming] services cannot be utilities, it’s not enough. They have to be — they almost have to make music a verb — it has to just move. And that’s what we’re trying to do.” Are you surprised that Drake’s new playlist More Life broke Apple Music’s most-streamed-in-a-24-hour-period record, despite the fact that the music release was not Apple exclusive?

It was fined heavily for avoiding taxes in China, and had to pay $318 million in a similar case in Italy. In fact, self-proclaimed 'fanboi' and British performer Stephen Fry criticized Apple heavily for the company's tax dodging as well. Now, the Cupertino giant has come under fire for diverting taxes in New Zealand. Local news publication New Zealand Herald reports that Apple sold products worth $4.2 billion NZD in the country, but failed to pay any taxes at all. It is important to note that since the operation in New Zealand is run from Australia, the company paid $37 million in income taxes to the Australian government instead. The report claims that this arrangement regarding taxes has been agreed on since at least 2007. It is worth considering that Apple is not legally obligated to pay any taxes to the authorities in New Zealand, and that many other local exporters exercise the same practice as well. However, the company has still come under fire from some political parties, as well as the public who have criticized it for not paying its share of taxes. As the New Zealand Herald estimates, had Apple reported the "same healthy profit margin in New Zealand as it did for its operations globally", it would have been liable to pay a sizeable $356 million NZD. An Apple representative responded to the backlash, saying that: Apple aims to be a force for good, and we're proud of the contributions we've made in New Zealand over the past decade, because our products and services are created, designed, and engineered in the US, that's where the vast majority of our tax is paid. While the public and political parties in New Zealand are furious over the fact that Apple has paid absolutely no tax in the country, the company has not yet been legally approached to revise the arrangement.

But rather than find herself the target of one of the president’s sharply worded tweets, the combative Dane, who last year slapped a 13 billion-euro ($14 billion) tax order on Apple Inc., is more likely to find herself in an antitrust twilight zone because Trump, who’s vowed to put America first, has yet to appoint top-level competition officials. Margrethe Vestager Photographer: Jasper Juinen/Bloomberg Vestager told reporters last week she’s still in the dark about how many officials at the U.S. Justice Department or the Federal Trade Commission she’d see during her short U.S. trip. Such meetings are a usual part of a careful co-operation between the U.S. and the EU as officials try to align deadlines for merger reviews and coordinate global cartel raids. Her visit comes months after she disregarded calls from the then President Barack Obama’s U.S. Treasury to avoid slapping Apple for its tax arrangements. While the EU and the U.S. antitrust authorities have often worked closely together, including to oppose a $28 billion oil-services merger last year, they’ve also clashed in the past on whether deals should be cleared or blocked. Nicolas Veron, a researcher at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said Europe is up against a potentially “destructive U.S. administration that’s willing to question very long standing positions of the U.S. government.” European regulators like Vestager must proceed with "extreme caution" in how to handle their opposite numbers in the U.S. Brussels ‘Hellhole’ The new U.S. administration has also undermined aspects of the trans-Atlantic relationship, with Trump having questioned the U.S. commitment to NATO, predicted other countries would follow the U.K. out of the bloc and even called Europe’s de facto capital, Brussels, a hellhole. Vestager also faces a White House that’s pledged to tear down regulations in a bid to promote more business activity. The former Danish economy minister will speak to almost 3,000 lawyers and officials at the American Bar Association, a key event in the antitrust world. She’s scheduled to speak at the event’s March 31  roundtable alongside the U.S. Justice Department’s assistant attorney general for antitrust, a position that hasn’t yet been filled. “It’s so early days that if they are confirmed by the time I get there it’s too early for us to meet,” she said on Wednesday. Her office said Friday that no meetings had yet been confirmed for her. Trump’s Pick The Justice Department’s antitrust division and the FTC, which share antitrust jurisdiction in the U.S., are both being run by temporary leaders until Trump names permanent replacements. Makan Delrahim, a former Justice Department lawyer now at the White House, is Trump’s pick to run the antitrust division, according to people familiar with the matter. Delrahim’s nomination requires Senate approval before he can step into the job. Antitrust, a policy spearheaded by the U.S. to rein in 19th century railroad and banking monopolies, is championed enthusiastically by the Brussels-based European Commission. Vestager said she works to keep markets open and to foster competition, basing her decisions on evidence and the law. This could see some conflict with a U.S. administration that is determined to favor American business over foreigners. “There are embers that are there that are glowing,” said Bill Kovacic, a professor at Georgetown Law and a former FTC Commissioner, of the EU-U.S. antitrust relationship. “There’s an unhappy recent track record of playing with fire in that area.” ‘Very Hostile’ The U.S. Treasury’s paper on the EU’s Apple case, sent by the previous administration, was “a very hostile memo. It was not so politely saying ‘you don’t know what you’re talking about, you can’t even do your own job properly,”’ he said. Aside from Apple, Vestager is spearheading a number of probes into American companies, including three at an advanced stage for Google, two for Qualcomm Inc. and one for Mastercard Inc. She’s weighing a complaint from airlines over aftermarket contracts from Boeing Co. and Airbus SE and investigating possible cartels between global banks over financial benchmarks, including in foreign exchange markets. U.S. Companies The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Sign Up The EU’s controversial investigations into tax rulings granted by European companies have overwhelmingly hit U.S. companies, with back-tax orders already issued to Apple and Starbucks Corp., with probes into Amazon.com Inc. and McDonald’s underway. EU officials argue that these tax structures are mostly used by multinationals, many of which are American, and that they are also probing two European firms. Still, Vestager seems to have avoided harsh enforcement for U.S. companies in recent months. She’s focused on fining European and Asian airlines, car-part manufacturers and car battery recyclers. The one American target under investigation that she’s moved on has been Amazon, which is working on a settlement that would allow it avoid fines. She approved a mega-merger between U.S. agricultural chemical giants Dow Chemical Co. and DuPont Co. on Monday after wresting tough concessions to overcome EU concerns that the deal could have harmed innovation. The EU had "very close contact with the case team of the Department of Justice all along to compare notes on this case," she said. Vestager insists that she’s neutral and that she doesn’t see “that the flag or the nationality of the company plays a role,” she told Bloomberg TV earlier this month. Even if the U.S. doesn’t take issue with EU antitrust enforcement, a cooling of what was once a close relationship might hold back regulators’ work. EU merger officials work closely and even rely on U.S. counterparts to examine how companies work and build cases on how a deal might be harmful. The EU’s handful of people working the Halliburton Co.-Baker Hughes Inc. merger probe was outnumbered by nearly two dozen U.S. officials. EU regulators "very much appreciate the concrete cooperation we have on a case-by-case basis" with the U.S. and "work very closely with U.S. teams on mergers," Vestager said in the interview. "That working relationship is very precious to us." Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

'We should have excellence in government,' Kushner told the Post. 'The government should be run like a great American company. Our hope is that we can achieve successes and efficiencies for our customers, who are the citizens.' The innovation group has been meeting twice a week in Kushner's office. The new office is set in place to help meet some of the goals Trump pledged to accomplish during his campaign. Kushner (pictured) said most of his team have little-to-no political experience, and instead have business experience All is forgiven: The announcement comes after the President was seen having dinner with Ivanka and Jared at his flagship Washington hotel on Saturday night Kushner added that most of the individuals on his team have little-to-no political experience.  They include Gary Cohn, director of the National Economic Council; Chris Liddell, assistant to the president for strategic initiatives and Reed Cordish, assistant to the president for intergovernmental and technology initiatives, to name a few.  Officials told the Post that Ivanka Trump, who now does her advocacy work from a West Wing office, will collaborate with the innovation office on issues such as workforce development. Ivanka is not expected to have an official role in the innovation office. The White House has stressed that Ivanka will voluntarily follow a series of government ethics rules when she takes up residence in her new office.  The announcement of the new office comes at a time Trump is attempting to seize back the initiative after a Republican bill to repeal and replace Obamacare imploded before it could even be voted on in the House of Representatives. It also comes after reports that President Trump was reportedly upset that Kushner was not around during the crucial healthcare week, instead choosing to head to Aspen for a skiing holiday with his family.  Read more: Trump taps Kushner to lead a SWAT team to fix government with business ideas - The Washington Post Share or comment on this article e-mail 494 shares Most watched News videos Dead man is cut out of the stomach of a seven metre long PYTHON Monkman gets the better of Seagull in University Challenge semi-final Shocking moment a driver is punched through his car window Driver's hilarious attempt to squeeze car through tight gap Maid caught on camera appearing to be POSSESSED by evil spirits Furious cyclist smashes driver's windscreen with his own bike Mother films invasive TSA pat-down of her disabled teenage son Brazen man catches huge COBRA out of hole with his bare hands Dad confronts policewoman who confiscated daffodils from daughters UNC's Luke Maye goes to his 8AM class after beating Kentucky Dramatic moment a car is struck by lightning as it drives down road Shocking carer steals money out of dementia patient's handbag Horrifying moment villagers cut open a giant python and...

By Asha McLean | March 27, 2017 -- 05:40 GMT (22:40 PDT) | Topic: Legal A Beijing court has overturned a ruling that Apple's iPhone 6 violated a patent owned by local manufacturer Shenzhen Baili, the South China Morning Post has reported. The Beijing Intellectual Property Office ruled last May that the tech giant violated design patents of the local device with its iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, and as a result was ordered to cease selling the smartphone in Beijing. Latest news on Asia ​LG sues US smartphone maker BLU over patent infringement Samsung plans to sell Galaxy Note 7 units as refurbished Xiaomi Redmi 4A becomes the new budget king in India with 250k sold in four minutes MillerCoors sues HCL Tech for $100 million over failure to implement ERP project ​Singapore begins final countdown to 2G network shutdown However, it is reported that the Intellectual Property Court in Beijing on Friday ruled in favour of the iPhone maker, quashing the decision of the bureau by stating Apple has not infringed the design patent. The Californian giant was accused of copying the exterior design of Shenzhen Baili's 100C smartphone, which is characterised by a curved edge and rounded corners, similar to the iPhone 6 range. Since kicking off court proceedings against Apple in December 2014, Shenzhen Baili has since folded, with South China Morning Post noting the local electronics manufacturer was hit by public criticism of its "poor quality" products. Shenzhen Baili was also backed by Chinese internet giant Baidu. The ruling handed to Apple last year by the Intellectual Property Office followed a dispute between the tech giant and China's Xintong Tiandi Technology -- which sells leather goods such as handbags and mobile phone cases -- that saw the iPhone maker lose the rights to the "iPhone" trademark. Apple filed its "iPhone" trademark in the category of "computer hardware and software" in China in October 2002, but the application did not gain approval until November 2013. Xintong Tiandi Technology applied to register its trademark "IPHONE" in the category of "leather goods" in China in September 2007. The decision means Xintong Tiandi Technology is able to continue selling leather goods labelled with the "IPHONE" brand. Apple upped its price for the iPhone 7 when it went on sale in China last year, which was mainly due to the depreciation of the Chinese currency during the prior 12 months, Apple explained. At the time, it was reported that some Chinese consumers consider Apple to be copying Chinese smartphones and that features such as dual cameras and handsets without headphone jacks were all firstly seen on Chinese smartphones. In a bid to dig deeper into China among increased competition from the likes of Huawei and ZTE, Apple announced plans in October to open a second research and development centre in China's tech manufacturing-mecca Shenzhen. The Shenzhen centre will be the second for the tech giant, with Apple CEO Tim Cook announcing in August plans to open the company's first China R&D centre in Beijing.

Timothy J. Seppala, @timseppala 03.23.17 in Personal Computing Comments 1622 Shares Share Tweet Share Save MacFormat Magazine One of Apple's big talking points is that Macs don't get viruses and that they're relatively safe when compared to Windows PCs. Well, WikiLeaks would like you to reconsider that notion with more info about Vault 7. The organization's latest dump is a handful of documents from the Central Intelligence Agency that detail, among other things, how the agency can infect a MacBook Air during its boot cycle via a modified Thunderbolt-to-Ethernet adapter. With "Sonic Screwdriver," the CIA's monitoring tools are stored on the dongle and the machine can be infected even if it's password protected. Considering how dongle dependent the new MacBooks are, this sort of exploit becomes even more worrying. Next on the list is a project called "Dark Matter" which is an umbrella for a handful of other spying initiatives. Perhaps most troubling is that these infections can persist even if you reinstall OS X. Then there's "NightSkies 1.2" which, as of 2008, was used to infect brand new iPhone 3Gs. "While CIA assets are sometimes used to physically infect systems in the custody of a target, it is likely that many CIA physical access attacks have infected the targeted organization's supply chain, including by interdicting mail orders and other shipments (opening, infecting and resending) leaving the United States or otherwise," WikiLeaks writes. So, the CIA could intercept iPhone orders, put malware on them and then make sure the devices got to a target. WikiLeaks also notes that despite some of the comparatively ancient dates on the documents, it appears the CIA continues using and updating at least a few of them. We've reached out to Apple for more information and will update this post should it arrive. In the case of the intercepted iPhones, there isn't much you can do (you've probably upgraded by now, and also are unlikely to be a target of CIA surveillance). But for everything else, just remember: Don't leave your laptop unattended in the open, and do not plug anything into your computer that was given to you by a stranger. Update: Apple has responded, saying in a statement that it believes the security hole mentioned only affected the iPhone 3G, and was fixed in the follow-up iPhone 3GS model. Also, the Mac vulnerabilities mentioned were fixed in all Macs launched after 2013. Additionally, it says that WikiLeaks has not submitted any information to it under its standard terms. In terms of the impact of these vulnerabilities, the Associated Press spoke to experts who explained how newer devices have technology that makes them harder to break into than an iPhone 3G. The addition of digital security certificates that can't be overwritten would make a warning pop up during setup of a compromised new device, while Thunderbolt revisions have made that hack harder to pull off. Apple: We have preliminarily assessed the Wikileaks disclosures from this morning. Based on our initial analysis, the alleged iPhone vulnerability affected iPhone 3G only and was fixed in 2009 when iPhone 3GS was released. Additionally, our preliminary assessment shows the alleged Mac vulnerabilities were previously fixed in all Macs launched after 2013. We have not negotiated with Wikileaks for any information. We have given them instructions to submit any information they wish through our normal process under our standard terms. Thus far, we have not received any information from them that isn't in the public domain. We are tireless defenders of our users' security and privacy, but we do not condone theft or coordinate with those that threaten to harm our users.

Right now, AMD Ryzen rumors are circling about how their processor would only get better with time as BIOS drivers and Windows 10 Scheduler Service updates are released. According to some other rumors, Ryzen would not have new driver support for Windows 7/8.1 and this comes as a disappointing news for people who were not planning to upgrade from Windows 7. Advertisement However, the biggest AMD Ryzen rumor is that Apple has decided to go for an AMD Ryzen APU for their MacBook Pro 2017. This might be possible with Raven Ridge, an AMD APU with Zen core architecture. Raven Ridge is all set to sail through the seas that have been dominated by Intel APU's.  Some Apple rumors suggest that the Cupertino company has decided to use AMD Ryzen because of its superior single thread and multi-thread performance at a lower power draw. The CPU's also run Linux base better than Intel i7. The lower TDP might have led Apple to opt for AMD Ryzen, which ensures maximum productivity at the lower expense of battery cost. AMD Ryzen as of now as been proved to be very effective processors for heavy processing tasks like graphics and editing. Therefore Apple, whose MacBook is a productivity-oriented laptop, would benefit greatly from the AMD Ryzen and Radeon Vega combination in Raven Ridge APUs. AMD Ryzen and Radeon Vega would allow MacBook users to do punchy graphical tasks. As such, AMD Ryzen rumors to be very versatile over a number of Zen architectures. The Raven Ridge would be having DDR4 capable memory, up to 4 Zen CPU cores, Vega architecture GPU, and a 14-nm process node.

This wasn't because the two phones can't be compared. Actually they can be. But the iPhone SE was just a much more expensive phone. It used to cost close to Rs 30,000 in the market. anyone hoping to buy a Rs 20,000 phone wouldn't consider it against something like the Moto G5 Plus, which sells for around Rs 15,000. But now the phones are comparable. The iPhone SE is selling a for Rs 19,999 now at most Apple-authorised stores. And that brings up the obvious question: if you are out shopping for a phone under Rs 20,000 should you pick the Moto G5 Plus or is the iPhone SE a better deal? The answer is not easy one here. Both these phones are quite good, and they both have strengths and weaknesses. But in a bid to keep the answer short, and without going into the technicalities of how the two phones compare, let me quickly break it down here. Depending on what you want, I hope by the time you finish reading this piece you will have an idea of which of these two phones you will pick. Reason to buy Moto G5 Plus over iPhone SE Bigger screen: This is the primary reason why you should opt for the Moto G5 Plus over the iPhone SE. The iPhone SE has a 4-inch screen and that is just too small for anyone who doesn't have hawk eye vision. Although the quality of the iPhone SE is really good, there is just so much quality can compensate for the lack of the size. From reading news to seeing photos on Facebook, everything is better on the large screen of the Moto G5 Plus. When it comes to watching videos or playing games, the experience is better on the Moto G5 Plus because of the screen size. Android Nougat: Although the iOS 10, which powers the iPhone SE, is pretty good, the Android Nougat is the world's best operating system. It its stock form - and Moto G5 Plus uses stock Android - it is slick, clean, versatile and feature-rich. It is easier to work with in almost every possible way. That old app problem - that iOS apps are better - is no longer there. In fact, nowadays apps like WhatsApp bring new features first to Android. It's cheaper: The Moto G5 Plus, if you are going for the 16GB variant, will save you Rs 5,000. Sure, you should spend a bit more and get the iPhoen SE if that is what you want. But in case you just want a good phone, don't care much about the brand, the Moto G5 Plus is a better value for money. More storage: The Moto G5 Plus is available with 32GB internal storage while the Rs 19,999 iPhone SE only has 16GB. This may not seem much of a difference on paper but is actually one of the biggest factors that affects user experience. 16GB nowadays is barely cutting it because of WhatsApp forwards and Facebook etc. These apps, and the data that they download on the phone, can fill a 16GB phone within a few months. Also Read: Apple iPhone SE review: Old bottle, new wine Dual SIM and microSD card: If you are dualSIM users - Jio in one slot, Airtel in other - the Moto G5 Plus is a better choice. The iPhone SE only has one SIM slot. Similarly, the Moto G5 Plus will let you add a microSD card. The iPhone SE won't. Better battery life: The Moto G5 Plus definitely has a better battery life compared to the iPhone SE. It lasts around 15 to 16 hours of use, which is a few hours more than what the iPhone SE can manage. Reason to buy iPhone SE over Moto G5 Plus Exquisite design and premium looks: If you want a phone that has premium looks, and finish, you can't go wrong with the iPhone SE. This is a phone that uses the timeless blocky design that made the iPhone 4 and iPhone 5 such a rage. And the materials it uses are downright exquisite. The feel and finishing of the iPhone SE is in a different class when compared to the Moto G5 Plus, which looks cheap in front of the Apple phone. Top of the line hardware and performance: The iPhone SE is a more expensive phone. It's only that now it is selling for Rs 19,999. And just like other high-end phones, it has top of the line hardware. The quality - but not the size -- of the screen is fantastic. The A9 processor inside the phone is fast and ensures that the iPhone SE runs even the more demanding games with ease. And the same is true for almost all components in the phone. Aftersales service: Apple has a lead here. Not only company will provide timely software updates for the iPhone SE for at least one or two more years, it also handles the customer complaints in case something goes wrong with the phone in a better way. Although, service is expensive for Apple products that are out of warranty period, if you don't mind spending some money it is prompt and consumers are treated with respect. Can't say the same for the service from most other brands in India. Also Read: Moto G5 Plus review: Pure Android, good camera make it best phone under Rs 20,000 Slightly better camera: The iPhone SE has a 12-megapixel camera. The Moto G5 Plus too has a 12-megapixel camera. But the iPhone SE is just more reliable. This is a phone that shoots images fast, and usually gets them right in terms of their colours, white-balance and exposure. Although the Moto G5 Plus has a brighter lens with F1.7, the way iPhone SE treats images makes it a better shooter in low light. On the video part too the iPhone SE does a better job. Summing it up Personally, if I am spending Rs 20,000 I will get the 32GB variant for the Moto G5 Plus. It is a more utilitarian phone. Also, I need to do a lot of work on my phone so need a bigger screen. But the iPhone SE spells class. It has a better design, better camera and more reliable performance. It looks better in hands. For anyone who is not going to stare at the screen 10 hours a day, the iPhone SE is a more viable option.

The White House Office of American Innovation — which will be led by Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner — is described as a “SWAT team,” using far-reaching powers to bypass the restrictive machinery of Washington and make sweeping changes. Kushner has already met with Tim Cook, Elon Musk, and Bill Gates The Post says that the office has a particular focus on technology and data, and has already met with the biggest names in the US tech industry, including Tim Cook, Elon Musk, and Bill Gates. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff is also among the 100-or-so business and government leaders who have already attended sessions with the group. President Trump gave a statement hinting at the authority the office of innovation would have. “All Americans, regardless of their political views, can recognize that government stagnation has hindered our ability to properly function, often creating widespread congestion and leading to cost overruns and delays,” he said to The Washington Post. Kushner said the office would be “an offensive team,” and would take lessons directly from business, pleasing its “customers” with efficiency. “The government should be run like a great American company,” Kushner said on Sunday. “Our hope is that we can achieve successes and efficiencies for our customers, who are the citizens.” The group is largely devoid of career politicians so far, drawing most of its number from business. He also indicated that the office would attract top talent from both inside the government and outside, aiming to keep a non-ideological, freewheeling stance that could draw in people who might otherwise have taken jobs in Silicon Valley. Among the people Kushner’s office have reached out to are several who have criticized his father-in-law’s policies and presidency. Trump’s Muslim ban, in particular, was publicly shot down by Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and other tech giants, and even Elon Musk, who was more receptive to discussion on the topic than most of his peers, came down against the executive order. But with the young Kushner at the head, and a non-partisan stance, the office could be more appealing to the Democrat-leaning Silicon Valley. The office aims to modernize the tech of every federal agency “Obviously it has to be done with corresponding values and principles. We don’t agree on everything,” Marc Benioff told The Washington Post. But Benioff, who donated money to Hillary Clinton’s campaign, said that Kushner was a more magnetic figurehead than some of his political peers. “I’m hopeful that Jared will be collaborative with our industry in moving this forward. When I talk to him, he does remind me of a lot of the young, scrappy entrepreneurs that I invest in in their 30s.” Kushner’s first targets are ambitious. The Washington Post says his office aims to modernize the technology and data infrastructure of every federal agency, draw up new training programs for the workforce, and create “transformative projects” like giving broadband to every US citizen. That’s alongside more specific and immediate plans to remodel the Department of Veterans Affairs — one of the promises made by Trump on his campaign trail that he has stuck to. Certainly, Kushner can be seen as a more collaborative and non-partisan figure than other White House power controllers. That includes vehemently ideological peer Steve Bannon, who has vowed to fight daily for the “deconstruction of the administrative state.” But whether Kushner is indeed able to affect sweeping changes inside the Washington machine, especially when his father-in-law has publicly failed to do so at every turn, is yet to be seen.

But not if you want to work for a large, established technology company. Amazon, together with Google and Apple, is now among the biggest recruiters from top-tier business school campuses around the world, rivalling traditional employers such as investment banks. Only consultancies hired more MBA graduates than Amazon at London Business School and Berkeley’s Haas School of Business in California last year. The online retailer was the number-one recruiter of MBAs at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business in 2016. Miriam Park, a masters in management graduate from MIT Sloan School of Management, is director of university programmes recruitment at Amazon. Her team last year hired MBA graduates “in the high hundreds” across the world. She declines to give a precise figure, but says the number of new entrants at MBA level was about 30 per cent higher than the previous 12 months. “I don’t foresee that growth rate slowing down any time soon,” she says. Starting salaries at Amazon range from $137,000 for a programme manager to $180,000 for a senior product manager, including signing bonuses, according to Transparent Career, a tech company that aggregates self-reported data in first jobs from recent MBA graduates. This compares with an average for consultancy positions of $165,000, and $170,000 for those taking jobs at investment banks. “What we find with the MBAs is that they want to create, they want to build and they want to take risks,” says Ms Park. “They’re fairly adaptable, they have a high level of what I would call ability to deal with ambiguity. Couple that with MBAs who have a great analytical bent and it’s the perfect pipeline.” Such skills are prized at Amazon, according to Ms Park. “We do something called working backwards from the customer,” she says. “This requires people who are good at analysing and diving deep and saying, what does the data actually tell us?” Amazon is a partner company on Ross’s Multidisciplinary Action Project, a core part of the school’s MBA course. A team of students spends seven weeks at Amazon, enabling both sides to decide if they want to work with one another, according to Damian Zikakis, director of career services at Ross. The retailer appeals to MBAs over other recruiters, according to Ms Park, because of the extent of its global reach, with ecommerce operations in 11 countries and customers in 185 nations. “If the MBA candidate happens to go to school in North America but actually really desires to be placed in India or China or London, we make those connections happen between our teams,” she says. Andrew Hill Business school: Working styles and CEOs find ‘flow’ with drugs A newsletter to help business students with their education and career Tuesday, 28 March, 2017 Amazon’s interest in MBAs is partly a reflection of its evolution from a 1990s dotcom start-up into one of the world’s largest companies by market capitalisation. As such it needs people who can develop strategy, manage project teams and create new services. But its size today attracts criticism. Amazon has adopted an MBA graduate hiring model in the same mould as banks and consultancies, according to Bhavik Trivedi, managing partner at Critical Square, an applicant advisory service. “They bring in highly talented people, churn and burn them in two to four years, and keep the cycle going,” Mr Trivedi says. “Some will stay and rise. The rest, they’ll be replaced.” Ms Park rejects the suggestion that Amazon does not care about developing new hires, noting that the company operates several fast-track management development schemes, such as its Pathways programme, which prepare MBA graduates for general manager, director and vice-president roles. “They enter as cohorts so they have a network of peers in addition to the programme leaders,” Ms Park says. Hiring MBA graduates is a natural next stage in the development of Amazon, which is as much concerned about improving large-scale logistics for delivery from its ecommerce site today as it is in finding analysts to develop new services, according to Ms Park. Amazon also has fans, such as Susan Cera, a director of Stratus Admissions Counseling. A big attraction of Amazon to MBA students, she says, is that it combines a start-up mentality in developing new online services with the security of a multinational business. This means that a new hire can hope to work there long enough to pay off their college debt. “Amazon is constantly entering new markets, which provides opportunities for a newly minted MBA to learn about being an entrepreneur in a low-risk environment with established infrastructure and support systems in place,” Ms Cera says. “Most MBAs we counsel don’t view Amazon as a pure tech company because much of Amazon’s success is due to smart financial management.” Sample the FT’s top stories for a week You select the topic, we deliver the news.

The newly revealed Rugged Combo, Rugged Case, and Add-On Keyboard for Rugged Case, have been created for "students and learning", with the day-to-day wear and tear in mind. Naturally, with use of such accessories there's also the benefit of protection for the tablet during accidental drops. Regarding these products, Michele Hermann, VP of mobility at Logitech, stated: We worked with Apple to design the Rugged Combo to be incredibly durable and protect iPad while bringing a secure keyboard connection that’s approved for testing, so teachers and students can focus on expanding what’s possible inside the classroom and beyond. The Rugged Case's frame sports soft polymer ribs, made to protect the tablet from drops of up to six feet, on surfaces as hard a concrete. It also comes with a built-in Surface-like kick stand, which has a 40 degree movement range and sturdy mechanical hinges. As far as the keyboard add-on is concerned, it connects to the iPad via a proprietary connector made by Logitech, and sources its power directly from the tablet. Also included is a row of shortcut keys to navigate the iPad's various functions. Finally, the Rugged Combo as the name suggests, combines the best of the previous accessories, thus ensuring that students are able to use the iPad for learning in a variety of settings (in the classroom, in the lab or on the field). These accessories will be available later in the week at apple.com/education/purchasing/, and can be acquired by schools and school districts in the United States and Canada. They can only be ordered in packs of 10.

This means sectors like manufacturing, education, and tech will soon be relying on machine intelligence to get the job done. Like always, Intel is following in the footsteps of other tech giants like Apple and Google to stay ahead in the AI game. Intel recently acquired Nervana, which focuses solely on AI. According to the press release, the company will be aligning its AI efforts under a single cross-Intel organization: the Artificial Intelligence Products Group (AIPG). “I am personally very energized about the opportunities before us as an industry. As CEO of Nervana, an AI company that Intel acquired last year, I saw what could be done. Now, after six months here, I see how the world can change when a company like Intel focuses on an effort. I believe this new organization will have a huge impact, not only for Intel, but upon the entire evolving AI space,” said Naveen Rao, who is now the vice president and general manager of the Artificial Intelligence Products Group at Intel. According to analysts from Technavio, the global artificial intelligence market in the industrial sector to grow at a CAGR of 52.65 percent during 2017-2021. The artificial intelligence (AI) market in the United States education sector is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 47.5 percent during 2017-2021, according to a new report by market research firm Research and Markets. As part of this AI initiative, Intel will be exploring novel architectural and algorithmic approaches to inform future generations of AI. “This includes a range of solutions from the data center to edge devices, and from training to inference – all designed to enable Intel and its customers to innovate faster. This will be the home for AI innovation at Intel,” said Rao. As always, Intel aims to be a trend setter. The company has earlier made its presence felt in computational trends, such as personal and cloud computing. “Intel intends to rally the industry around a set of standards for AI that ultimately brings down costs and makes AI more accessible to more people – not only institutions, governments and large companies, as it is today,” he said. “Artificial Intelligence (AI) is changing the world around us and will bring new capabilities to everything from smart factories to drones to sports to health care and to driverless cars. Data is the common thread across all these applications, and our strategy is to make Intel the driving force of the data revolution across every industry,” he added.

The competition is part of Intel’s strategy for enabling state-of-the-art AI in the industry by working, among other ways, to make AI training and tools broadly accessible to developers through the Intel® Nervana™ AI Academy. Registration for the competition began last week. The entry deadline is June 14. The prize pool totals $100,000 for the top-three finishers, including $50,000 for the first-place competitor. Additionally, a $20,000 special prize will be awarded to the competitor with the Best Intel Tools Usage. See the official registration site for complete rules. “We aim to challenge developers, data scientists and students to develop AI algorithms to help solve real-world challenges in industries including medical and health care,” said Doug Fisher, senior vice president and general manager of the Software and Services Group at Intel. Intel's Aicha Evans says 5G will be the biggest shift many of us see in our lives. No pressure, 5G. https://t.co/ljDkhlFh3r pic.twitter.com/z6IwkI5CBG — Intel IT Center (@IntelITCenter) March 4, 2017 “It is inspiring to see how MobileODT’s breakthrough optical diagnostic devices and software services, combined with Intel-based AI that Kagglers develop through this competition, will greatly improve MobileODT’s quality assurance workflow.

Terrill, Associated Press Timberwolves guard Tyus Jones, right, got word in Portland, Ore., on Saturday that his younger brother, Tre, and Apple Valley High won the Class 4A title by beating Champlin Park, the Eagles' second boys' basketball state title in three years. Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on: Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink: Purchase: Order Reprint PORTLAND, ORE. – Informed of the result by team broadcaster Jim Petersen at halftime, Timberwolves reserve point guard Tyus Jones’ text messages by the end of Saturday’s 112-100 loss at Portland told the story of what happened back home at Target Center that night. Jones’ younger brother, Tre, and Apple Valley High won the Minnesota Class 4A title earlier Saturday evening by beating Champlin Park, their second title in three years. They did so with Tre doing some of everything in the final, decisive minutes on his way to a 24-point, 18-rebound, five-assist performance that caused his coach to reaffirm one more time that he’s a “once in a lifetime” player. Even if maybe he isn’t at the moment the best in his family. “He’s not there yet,” Tyus said with a grin, “but he’s definitely on his way at a fast rate.” Tyus’ Timberwolves teammates agree, and playfully. “I keep telling him his brother is going to be better than him if he keeps going, and I think Tyus doesn’t discredit that one bit,” Wolves big man Karl-Anthony Towns said. “He’s fortunate. He has a big brother like Tyus who can teach him everything he knows on the NBA level, all the little knicks and knacks that he learns from the game. To teach his brother in high school, I wish I had an older brother like that.” Tyus Jones Tyus has won one state high school title and an NCAA title in his career. Tre has won two prep championships and could make it three next year, his senior year. When Tyus checked his phone from Moda Center, the celebration after a 60-54 victory had commenced after his brother scored on a layup, assisted on two other made baskets and grabbed two rebounds, all in the final minute. “They’re having fun,” Tyus said, smiling. “It sounds like the finish was very exciting. I’m very happy for him. He works his tail off and a lot of people wrote him and Apple Valley off this year. He deserves it.” Tyus talked to his brother on Saturday afternoon before the title game and called him on his way out of Moda Center after the Wolves lost their sixth consecutive game, this time after Blazers guards CJ McCollum and Damian Lillard combined to score 53. Tyus said he told his brother to continue to “play with that chip” on his shoulder. “Lead his team, be the best player on the court and find a way,” Jones said before both of Saturday’s games. “I’m real confident in him tonight.” And as it turns out, with good reason on a night when a point guard just like his big brother grabbed 18 rebounds. “He’s a crazy rebounder,” Tyus said. “He does a little bit of everything.” By the bootstraps The Wolves allowed their opponent 100 or more points Saturday for the ninth consecutive game. They also allowed the Trail Blazers 62.5 percent shooting, the best by an opponent this season. After Saturday’s game, Wolves coach Tom Thibodeau was asked if his team is experiencing a collective fatigue and letup late in the season. “I don’t know whether it’s collective,” Thibodeau said. “Every team plays the same amount of games. They go through the same things you’re going through. You get into stuff together, you get out of stuff together. You have to be mentally tough. There’s games we let get away that we should have won. You learn from it, you get ready for the next one.” Take that Bypassed by the Wolves in the 2013 draft, McCollum followed his career-high 43 points against them on New Year’s Day at Target Center by scoring 32 Saturday. Afterward, he admitted playing with a little extra something against teams that passed him by. The Wolves traded the ninth pick that year to Utah for the 14th and 21st picks. The Wolves took Trey Burke for the Jazz and the Jazz took Shabazz Muhammad and Gorgui Dieng for the Wolves and the Blazers then took McCollum 10th. “I think over the course of my career I’ve played well against teams that didn’t draft me,” said McCollum, who has scored 20 or more points against the Wolves four consecutive times.

A 4-year-old boy used Siri to call emergency services in London and help his mom who stopped breathing, reports the BBC. The boy, Roman, unlocked his mom's phone with her thumb and used Siri to call 999 (the emergency number in the UK). In the phone call released by Metropolitan Police, emergency services asked him to wake up his mom and when she didn't wake, they sent over an ambulance in 13 minutes. Thankfully, the mom is now OK and back home with her kids. Related: Here's Why You Should Turn Off This iOS Feature ASAP This story is a reminder of just one way the iPhone can save your life.

Home News World UK: Attacker used whatsapp, firm must help police... | Mar 26, 2017  |  Vote 0    0 UK: Attacker used whatsapp, firm must help police get access Britain attack tributes Dominic Lipinski,The Associated Press People look at floral tributes in Parliament Square in London laidout for the victims of the Westminster attack on Wednesday. Khalid Masood killed four people and left more than two dozen hospitalized, including some with what have been described as catastrophic injuries. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the attack. next play/pause pre Waterloo Region Record By Gregory Katz LONDON — Westminster Bridge attacker Khalid Masood sent a WhatsApp message that cannot be accessed because it was encrypted by the popular messaging service, a top British security official said Sunday. British press reports suggest Masood used the messaging service owned by Facebook just minutes before the Wednesday rampage that left three pedestrians and one police officer dead and dozens more wounded. As controversy swirled over the encrypted messages, police made another arrest in Birmingham, England, where Masood had lived. The 30-year-old is one of two men now in custody over possible links to the attack. Neither has been charged or publicly named. Masood was shot dead on the grounds of Parliament. Home Secretary Amber Rudd used appearances on BBC and Sky News to urge WhatsApp and other encrypted services to make their platforms accessible to intelligence services and police trying to carrying out lawful eavesdropping. "We need to make sure that organizations like WhatsApp — and there are plenty of others like that — don't provide a secret place for terrorists to communicate with each other," she said. Rudd did not provide any details about Masood's use of WhatsApp, saying only "this terrorist sent a WhatsApp message and it can't be accessed." But her call for a "back door" system to allow authorities to retrieve information is likely to meet resistance from the tech industry, which has faced previous law enforcement demands for access to data after major attacks. In the United States, Apple fought the FBI's request for the passcodes needed to unlock an iPhone that had been used by one of the perpetrators in the 2015 extremist attack in San Bernardino, California. The FBI initially claimed it could obtain the data only with Apple's help, but ultimately found another way to hack into the locked phone. Masood drove a rented SUV into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge before smashing it into Parliament's gates and rushing onto the grounds, where he fatally stabbed a policeman and was shot by other officers. A detailed police reconstruction has found the entire attack lasted 82 seconds. Police are trying to pinpoint his motive and identify any possible accomplices, making the WhatsApp message a potential clue to his state of mind and his social media contacts. Rudd said attacks like Masood's would be easier to prevent if authorities could penetrate encrypted services after obtaining warrants similar to the ones used to listen in on telephone calls or — in snail mail days — to steam open letters and read their contents. Without a change in the system, she said terrorists would be able to communicate with each other without fear of being overheard even in cases where a legal warrant has been obtained. Rudd also urged technology companies to do a better job at preventing the publication of material that promotes extremism. She plans to meet with firms Thursday about setting up an industry board that would take steps to make the web less useful to extremists. British police investigating the attack say they still believe Masood, a 52-year-old Briton, acted alone and say they have no indications that further attacks are planned. Metropolitan Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu said it may never be possible to fully determine Masood's motives. "That understanding may have died with him," Basu said Saturday night as police appealed for people who knew Masood or saw him to contact investigators. "Even if he acted alone in the preparation, we need to establish with absolute clarity why he did these unspeakable acts, to bring reassurance to Londoners." The Islamic State group, which is losing territory in Iraq and Syria but still has radical followers in other parts of the world, has claimed Masood was a "soldier" carrying out its wishes to attack Western countries. Masood had convictions for violent crimes in the U.K. and spent time in prison. He also worked in Saudi Arabia teaching English for two years and travelled there again in 2015 on a visa designed for religious pilgrimages. Along with the man arrested Sunday, a 58-year-old man detained in Birmingham several days ago remains in custody in the case. Nine others arrested after the attack have been freed without charges, while one person was released on bail.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Town to re-announce settlement terms of Prop 218 lawsuit Sunday Mar 26, 2017 at 4:46 PM Mar 26, 2017 at 4:46 PM Letters recently exchanged between attorneys resulted in the town agreeing to re-announce settlement terms related to a Prop 218 lawsuit that alleged mismanagement of wastewater funds and fees. Matthew Cabe Staff Writer @DP_MatthewCabe APPLE VALLEY — The terms of a settlement agreement — reached in February by the town and one of its residents — regarding a Proposition 218 lawsuit will be re-announced, letters obtained by the Daily Press show. The suit, filed by Christina Lopez-Burton, alleged Prop 218 violations related to the town’s management of wastewater funds and fees. One of Lopez-Burton’s settlement stipulations was the general terms be announced in public. That stipulation was seemingly met during the Council’s Feb. 14 meeting, but it spurred four letters between Lopez-Burton’s attorney, Eric Benink, and Town Attorney John Brown, with Benink stating Mayor Scott Nassif’s announcement failed to comply with the settlement agreement. The result of the written exchange is that the terms will be re-announced during the Council’s March 28 meeting, town spokeswoman Kathie Martin confirmed Thursday. “The plan is we’ll come out of closed session (and) read the settlement agreement basically verbatim,” Martin said, adding the terms of the settlement hadn’t changed. But the re-announcement — to be read by the town clerk — will likely be made begrudgingly, as the letters show Brown agreed to it only after Benink indicated the possibility of further litigation. In the first letter — dated March 6 — Benink said Nassif didn’t address certain settlement terms, including that wastewater rates would be reset to $31.43 on March 1 and that the town was required to adopt new wastewater rates pursuant to a rate study no later than June 1. The settlement terms and the alleged violations listed in the suit were the subject of a previous Daily Press report. He also took issue with the timing of Nassif’s announcement, which followed closed session. “The Town made this announcement at the end of a two hour and forty-five minute meeting and after all members of the public had left,” Benink wrote. “While the Settlement Agreement did not specify exactly when (Benink’s emphasis) the announcement needed to be made during the meeting, this tactic is not within the spirit of the agreement.” Benink demanded a second announcement at the Council’s next meeting; however, he did not specify when during the next meeting despite the aforementioned dissatisfaction. Brown replied with a March 10 letter in which he disagreed with Benink’s interpretation of the Feb. 14 proceedings, stating, “I understand all of the terms and conditions of the Agreement have either been performed or are in the process of being performed.” Brown referred to the lawsuit as “prolonged and quite burdensome for the Town,” adding that Benink’s request constituted “a repetitive exercise at the expense of the Town’s taxpayers.” Benink’s next letter came March 20. He argued the town brought the lawsuit on itself given that he sent a letter on Nov. 6, 2015, to Town Manager Frank Robinson “detailing how we believed the Town’s wastewater fees were not Proposition 218 compliant.” “Thereafter, you and I spoke and exchanged emails,” Benink wrote, “and you advised me that (Best Best & Krieger) would forward a letter to me to propose some solutions. The letter never arrived.” The suit was then filed on March 28, 2016. “It would be unfortunate for all concerned if the Town forced us to file a motion to enforce the Settlement Agreement over this issue,” Benink wrote. “But in light of the Town’s callous disregard of its obligations, Ms. Lopez-Burton is prepared to do so.” On March 22, Brown replied that he “could not legally disagree more with the contention that the Town’s report … was not sufficient,” but added, “the Town is simply not prepared to spend any more time and money on this protracted litigation.” “The Town is prepared, once again, to report out the general terms of the Settlement Agreement at an upcoming Town Council meeting in Open Session,” Brown wrote. According to Martin, the re-announcement will again come after closed session, even though Benink stated the town’s initial actions were “disappointing and do not foster a sense of trust between the community and (its) elected officials.” “The majority of the people who get information from our meetings watch it online,” Martin said, adding the settlement was released to the public via a previous Daily Press report in addition to the first announcement — a fact also referenced in Brown's letters. "I am hard pressed to know what type of report might satisfy Ms. Lopez-Burton," Brown wrote in the final letter, "but we will do our very best and I trust that the Town's further efforts ... will conclusively resolve this litigation at long last."

Ford, Amazon and Starbuck Team Up, Give Hint of Connected Car’s Future by Paul A. Eisenstein Share Share Tweet Comment Email Print advertisement For many Americans, the day doesn't begin without a cup of coffee to go for the commute. Now, a new alliance between Ford, Amazon, and Starbucks should make it a little faster and easier to order and pay for that morning brew. At its annual shareholders meeting in Seattle on Wednesday, Amazon officials confirmed Ford vehicles equipped with the maker's latest Sync3 infotainment system will be able to order and pay for their coffee by connecting to the Amazon Alexa voice assistant. It's just the first step in what could come, over the next few years, as automakers expand the capabilities of their increasingly connected cars.

From Automaker to Tech Company? For his part, Ford CEO Mark Fields has said the carmaker prefers to now view itself as a "mobility company," rather than an automotive manufacturer. That means it is expanding its focus to include such things as ride and car-sharing. It is also looking for new ways to let motorists connect to the outside world. And that's something expected to become increasingly important as the era of autonomous driving becomes a reality — all the more so if that includes completely driverless vehicles that will transform the vehicle into a lounge on wheels. Ford, for its part, has promised to begin producing its first driverless models in 2021, primarily for ride-sharing services, such as Uber and Lyft. Related: Starbucks to Create 240,000 New Jobs by 2021 Even before that sci-fi concept becomes an everyday reality, however, automakers are looking to give motorists more options to connect with the outside world, whether to play smartphone apps through new technologies like Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, or by integrating voice assistants — like Alexa, Apple's Siri, and Microsoft's Cortana — into the vehicle. Virtual Partnerships Amazon and Starbucks already teamed up in January, with Alexa getting a new "skill" that allowed a customer to place their "usual" order and have it waiting at one of the stores they have visited recently, Alexa even handling the charge through Starbucks' Mobile Order & Pay function. Ford, meanwhile, has begun incorporating Alexa into new vehicles equipped with its latest Sync 3 infotainment software. Starting later this year, that will allow a motorist to place a Starbucks order as they're heading to one of the coffee shops. Ford already has a similar partnership allowing Sync users to order a pizza from Domino's. Related: 5 Ways a Smart Assistant Can Transform Your Morning Expect to see similar alliances in other brands in the near future. Volkswagen announced at the Consumer Electronics Show in January that it was also set to give Alexa a home in its cars. It will become part of the German maker's Car-Net system. Hyundai this year integrated the Amazon voice assistant into its Blue Link system. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles has opted to partner with Google, and is pairing the Google Assistant with its UConnect infotainment system, while Nissan and BMW are partnering with Microsoft and Cortana. With its home Echo devices, Alexa has established the largest base for such services. And "she" has been adding skills to its repertoire since its launch in late 2014, and it can be used to place orders for a variety of goods and services. Observers expect to see more of these partnerships develop in the near future. Automakers seem especially eager to form such alliances. Ford has been aggressive in marketing Sync since it first introduced the technology, company research showing that it has helped attract many buyers — digitally minded Millennials, in particular — who consider high-tech features more important than horsepower ratings. Data vs Security But automakers also are looking for ways to directly monetize their services as another gateway to consumers. "The new asset in the automotive business is data," said Danny Le, principal and automotive leader at KPMG. There is a potential downside, Le warned, noting that "Data is becoming a currency, with actual value, and it must be protected. Security needs to be invested in."

But the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration last year declared vehicle cybersecurity one of the most important issues for the auto industry to address in the coming years. Giving cars the ability to order goods — and to pay for them — adds another potential wrinkle. But that risk seems to be doing little to slow down the push for in-car digital services. It might just give security experts a chance to caffeinate themselves as they head to work. Paul A.

Chinese Court Rules in Favor of Apple in Patent Disputes VOA News Facebook 0 Twitter 0 E-mail More Google+ LinkedIn KakaoStory March 27, 2017 08:10 A Chinese court has ruled in favor of Apple in design patent disputes between the Cupertino, California company and a domestic phone-maker, overturning a ban on selling iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus phones in China, Xinhua news agency reported. Last May, a Beijing patent regulator ordered Apple's Chinese subsidiary and a local retailer Zoomflight to stop selling the iPhones after Shenzhen Baili Marketing Services lodged a complaint, claiming that the patent for the design of its mobile phone 100c was being infringed by the iPhone sales. Apple and Zoomflight took the Beijing Intellectual Property Office's ban to court. A woman walks past an Apple store in Beijing, China on July 28, 2016. /Reuters The Beijing Intellectual Property Court on Friday revoked the ban, saying Apple and Zoomflight did not violate Shenzhen Baili's design patent for 100c phones. The court ruled that the regulator did not follow due procedures in ordering the ban while there was no sufficient proof to claim the designs constituted a violation of intellectual property rights. Representatives of Beijing Intellectual Property Office and Shenzhen Baili said they would take time to decide whether to appeal the ruling, according to Xinhua. In a related ruling, the same court denied a request by Apple to demand stripping Shenzhen Baili of its design patent for 100c phones. Apple first filed the request to the Patent Reexamination Board of State Intellectual Property Office. The board rejected the request, but Apple lodged a lawsuit against the rejection. The Beijing Intellectual Property Court on Friday ruled to maintain the board's decision. It is unclear if Apple will appeal.

Skip to content Home News Sports Metro Plus Politics Business Entertainment Opinion Editorial Columnists Jobs Sections Search for: Gadgets Five reasons to buy a big smartphone (phablet) Published March 27, 2017March 27, 2017 Share Tweet Pin it +1 With  Ozioma Ubabukoh, 07053937947 [email protected] The flagships people called huge just two years ago are now considered ‘compact’ versions of their evolved, larger selves; and devices that straddle the line between traditional smartphones and small tablets are more en vogue than ever with popular phone makers. According to Brighthand, now that Apple – the purveyor of mainstream tech taste in America, for better or worse – has followed the trend with its iPhone 6 Plus and iPhone 7 Plusý, more people than ever are seriously considering a large-screened smartphone as their next daily driver. But with that consideration, comes increased scepticism. A prospective phablet buyer may ask: “Aren’t these things just too big?” And for some, they may well be – they’re never going to fit too snugly in your pants pocket. For the most parts though people think anyone who is looking to upgrade to a higher-end phone over end of the year period shouldn’t talk themselves out of the phablet discussion. Here’s why. More comfortable media Generally, the best aspect of any phablet is also the thing that makes it a “phablet” in the first place: its mammoth screen. We usually put anything with a 5.5-inch display or bigger into the phablet category, and while the extra half-inch or so it adds to a standard flagship’s screen doesn’t sound like much on paper, it makes a noticeable difference in practice. Watching a movie or playing a game on a larger 1080p (or higher) smartphone screen is simply more luxurious than watching it on a smaller one. It’s like how viewing a bigger HDTV is more comfortable and engrossing than hunching over a littler one; multimedia just has more room to breathe on these things, and you don’t get that mental barrier of “I’m watching this the wrong way” as much as you will with a slightly smaller screen as a result. With games, you also have more space to navigate any onscreen controls. You can simply enjoy your stuff. The idea is to give you the best of both worlds – phone and tablet -and the best phablets do this spectacularly. Devices like the Google Nexus 6 and Samsung Galaxy Note 4, among others, ýhave gorgeous, probably too sharp quad HD (2560 x 1440) displays, but are easy enough to throw in a coat pocket or carry around with one hand. Taking in media on a high-end TV or laptop screen still looks better, but for those instances where you will normally use a smaller smartphone or more unwieldy tablet – such as a cramped flight – a good phablet finds the sweet spot between quality and convenience. Better battery life It’s not a universal thing, but most popular phablets keep those big screens going by packing in batteries that make the most of the room provided by their larger chassis. Battery life is one of the few aspects of today’s smartphones where there is obvious room for improvement, but with handsets like the OnePlus One and the aforementioned iPhone 6 and 7 Plus, it’s not uncommon to get through the majority of two days off of a single charge. This is one instance where phablets’ propensity for overkill works to your advantage; unless you’ve been totally careless, you rarely need to worry about making it through the end of the day with a phablet in tow. They’re a step forward for mobile tech in that way. Frustration-free typing Typos are right alongside paper cuts on the list of “Things Nobody Likes,” but the wide body of a phablet makes it far less likely to fudge up your texts. The keys on a phablet’s virtual keyboard are naturally fatter and wider and they greatly lower the chance of you asking your friends “wgata ip” instead of “what’s up.” Normal smartphones make typing difficult for those with large hands or chubby fingers, but with a phablet, everyone can avoid that frustration. Less device clutter As said above, the best phablets successfully bridge the gap between the convenience of a phone and the luxuriousness of a tablet. So, for those who don’t want to (or can’t) burn the cash to get both types of devices, a phablet can actually represent good value. Yes, on their own, they’re quite expensive, but a good phablet makes a good tablet far more redundant than a good smartphone does. Now, if you’d rather your tablet be a more work-oriented tool like a Surface Pro, today’s phablets aren’t going to replicate that kind of heavy duty functionality just yet. They’re still far closer to smartphones than laptops. But it’s harder to use something like a Nexus 7 or ýiPad mini, tablets that can get work done but are more oriented towards casual consumption, if you have a Nexus 6 or iPhone 6 Plus already. It’s not a 1:1 replacement, but because phablets are more accommodating to extended web browsing, gaming, and simple work tasks (like emailing and note taking) than a smaller smartphone, they can lessen the need to buy more stuff, which is always nice. What’s your other hand doing anyways? The biggest knock against phablets is that they’re difficult to use comfortably with one hand. People won’t deny that – trying to type with one thumb on a 6-inch screen like that of Huawei Ascend Mate7 only leads to repeatedly dropping the device. In all honesty, the amount of time per day where people only have one hand free is pretty slim. Those instances where the need is genuine usually aren’t the best times to be staring into a smartphone screen either. There have been countless books and articles written on the idea that people aren’t as busy as they think they are, and the notion that a smartphone needs to be usable with one hand to justify itself ties into that phenomenon. Are you really always on the go, holding a briefcase in one hand, typing up a crucial email in the other? It’s a great thing when something strong and convenient like the Xperia Z3 Compact rolls along, for sure, but needing two hands to type “fail vids” in the YouTube app probably isn’t the end of the world. Most phablets aren’t so big that it’s impossible to take a call or unlock the device with one hand, and the power and comfort they bring to almost everything else more than makes up for the fact that you may have to put your coffee down every now and again while using it. Besides, typing something out with two hands is usually more efficient and error-free than doing so with one, regardless of screen size. People should only accept a smartphone that works for them, of course, but if you take a step back and think about how often your other hand is just lying there, you may find the concept of a bigger smartphone a little less intimidating.

Here’s why you should play it By Geoffrey Tim Posted on March 23, 2017 2 min read 1 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Share on Pinterest Share on Linkedin Share on Tumblr Super Mario Run as released on Apple’s ecosystem last year, and I spent much of my December break trying to grab all of those coins. You see, there’s a hidden genius to Super Mario Run that’s not immediately apparent. The game is now, finally, available on Android. It’s a free-to-download game that only grants you access to the first three levels. Anything after that and you’ll be asked to pony up $10, which is a lot to ask for a mobile game. But there’s a very good reason why it’s worth it. When you play through the levels, which automatically move the moustachioed plumber to the right, getting to the end of each level is easy peasy. You don’t have fine, granular control, able to only control Mario’s jumps. It’s not about getting to the end of the level though. Its real charm, and its real challenge, comes in collecting all of the coins. When you first play through a level, there are special pink coins to collect. They’re pretty easy to find and collect, requiring just the right timing. Collecting all five of those will unlock 5 purple one your next run through the same level. Those are quite a bit trickier – but it’s the black coins that you unlock for your third run that are the real fun. They remix the levels, and are incredibly challenging. They’re the real reason to play Super Mario Run, as Alessandro pointed out. “They’re the ultimate challenge in the runner, but also (mostly) its most fair. Your reflexes are tested here in a way that the core game experiences doesn’t even get close to. Timing wall jumps that change Mario’s running direction to interact with (and selectively avoid) certain level elements are the only way to reach the little bastards, and even then it’s sometimes not enough. Knowing where the coins were was just the first step, while figuring out how to reach them was an entirely different one. Certain coins required a ridiculous amount of setup which, which ranged from the brilliant to the tedious. A handful required the timely murder of a specific Koopa, so that I could later vault off his shell into the air or have it bounce off a coin from an inaccessible area. Others bordered on the ridiculous, like a particular Black Coin snuggled between two pillars of spikes, which required the use of an invincibility Star to wall hop between. Miss that single chance to get it, and restart the level.” Fun and frustrating in equal measure.

While the much-anticipated new phone will set you back £599, it’s just possible an iPod they stopped making could be worth more. The old iPod Classic has sold for nearly £700 on auction sites. And second-hand ones can go for more than £300 – so it might be worth raiding your loft. iPod Classics are going for big money The reason appears to be it is rare – Apple was having difficulty finding parts so decided to ditch the classic design. Getting one now will cost you more than buying any of the current range of iPods – and if you have one you don’t use, you might want to consider selling them. More than 3,000 of the old model have been sold on eBay.co.uk – with some new ones listed for £600 – others have sold for more than £500 on Amazon. The coins in your pocket that could be worth hundreds of pounds A second hand 160GB version can cost more than £200 on Amazon.co.uk or up to £300 on eBay if they’re in good condition. Other versions are selling for less, but you can still make a fair bit – with 80GB versions selling for more than £100 – but the real money’s in limited editions. The Lego sets which sell for thousands of pounds A set of four U2 iPods – still in their boxes – sold for an astonishing £50,000 on eBay last month with other rare versions selling for thousands recently. So if you have one gathering dust somewhere, get it out, get online and see what similar models are selling for - you could be in for an early Christmas present.

Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Mar 26, 2017 at 1:31PM Many investors who watched Fitbit (NYSE:FIT) and GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO) crash and burn may believe that demand for wearable devices -- like fitness trackers and action cameras -- is fading. Indeed, earlier estimates for these markets were far too bullish. Back in 2014, Morgan Stanley estimated that Apple would sell up to 60 million Apple Watches in the first year. The actual number, according to IDC, was just under 12 million. In early 2015, Research and Markets estimated that the global action camera market would grow at a compound annual growth rate of 22% between 2014 and 2019. Yet market leader GoPro's revenue still fell 27% in 2016. Image source: Getty Images. However, investors shouldn't completely ignore the growth potential of other wearable makers. Let's take a closer look at three companies -- Garmin (NASDAQ:GRMN), Taser International (NASDAQ:TASR), and Ambarella (NASDAQ:AMBA) -- which could still benefit from high sales of wearable devices even as market leaders like Fitbit and GoPro struggle with sluggish growth. Garmin Garmin's fitness trackers and GPS watches have become major pillars of growth in recent quarters. Last quarter, its Fitness revenue rose 20% annually and accounted for 32% of its top line, fueled by strong demand for its Vivofit products and newer devices equipped with its Elevate heart rate tracking technology. Garmin's Connect IQ app store has also encouraged developers to create custom apps for its devices -- an ecosystem which Fitbit notably still lacks. Garmin's Outdoor revenue rose 46% during the quarter and accounted for 20% of its top line, thanks to strong sales of its high-end Fenix 5 heart rate tracking GPS watches. Its Marine and Aviation GPS revenues also rose by the double digits. Garmin's only soft spot was the Automotive business, which posted a 17% decline in revenues due to the rise of smartphone-based GPS solutions. However, Garmin's total revenue still rose 10% annually during the quarter. Garmin's Fenix 5 GPS watches. Image source: Garmin. Garmin's top line growth is expected to remain flat in 2017 and earnings are expected to drop 6% (on higher taxes and weakness in the auto market), but its growing dependence on wearable devices is expected to respectively boost its sales and earnings by 2% and 3% in fiscal 2018. Taser International Taser is generally known for its namesake electric weapons, but most of its growth comes from its Axon body cameras and related software services. The Axon body cameras are frequently used by law enforcement officials, and demand for the devices has been rising due to a series of controversial police shootings across America. Taser's Axon 2 body camera. Image source: Taser. Axon's cloud platform also backs up the captured footage, and it recently beefed up that service with the acquisitions of computer vision company Dextro and a computer vision team from Fossil Group. Together, those businesses form the new "Axon AI" group, which will help law enforcement agencies "quickly isolate and analyze the most important seconds of footage" from the accumulated videos. Last quarter, Taser's total revenues rose 46% annually. Taser sales, which accounted for 71% of that total, rose 25%. Axon sales, which accounted for the remaining 29%, soared 154%. Analysts expect Taser's revenue and earnings to respectively rise 20% and 25% this year. Ambarella Ambarella is generally known for making image processing SoCs for GoPro. GoPro is still Ambarella's top customer, but the chipmaker's dependence on the struggling action camera maker is declining. That's because Ambarella also provides image processing SoCs for a wide range of other customers, including drone makers like DJI, security camera makers like Hikvision, as well as Taser's Axon body cams and Snap's Spectacles. Image source: Ambarella. Ambarella also supplies SoCs to GoPro's biggest rivals, like Xiaomi-backed Yi Technology and Garmin, which launched its first 4K action camera last year. This means that GoPro's pain, which dragged down Ambarella stock in the past, won't necessarily hurt the chipmaker anymore. This shift was reflected in Ambarella's year-over-year revenue growth over the past two quarters. Ambarella's revenue still dipped 2% in fiscal 2017, and analysts expect its revenue to remain flat this year with a double-digit drop in earnings. But as the chipmaker pivots away from GoPro, its revenue and earnings are expected to respectively rise 14% and 16% next year. But mind the headwinds... Garmin, Taser, and Ambarella all look like better long-term wearables plays than GoPro or Fitbit, but investors should be mindful of their shortcomings. Garmin's wearables business is booming, but it must maintain its current growth rate to offset the ongoing declines in its automotive business. Taser's growth numbers look great, but the stock trades at a whopping 70 times earnings -- which is much higher than its industry average of 19. Ambarella has a well-diversified customer base, but rising competition from bigger chipmakers like Qualcomm could throttle its growth. Therefore, investors should carefully weigh these pros and cons before buying these stocks as long-term plays on the wearables market. Leo Sun owns shares of Qualcomm.

London Metropolitan Police/Getty Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email LONDON -- Westminster Bridge attacker Khalid Masood sent a WhatsApp message that can’t be accessed because it was encrypted by the popular messaging service, a top British security official said Sunday. British press reports suggest Masood used the messaging service owned by Facebook just minutes before the Wednesday rampage that left three pedestrians and one police officer dead and dozens more wounded. London attack victim identified as Utah man As controversy swirled over the encrypted messages, police made another arrest in Birmingham, England, where Masood had lived. The 30-year-old is one of two men now in custody over possible links to the attack. Neither has been charged or publicly named. Masood was shot dead on the grounds of Parliament. 30 Photos London attack Photos of the London attack near Parliament Home Secretary Amber Rudd used appearances on BBC and Sky News to urge WhatsApp and other encrypted services to make their platforms accessible to intelligence services and police trying to carrying out lawful eavesdropping. “We need to make sure that organizations like WhatsApp -- and there are plenty of others like that -- don’t provide a secret place for terrorists to communicate with each other,” she said. Rudd did not provide any details about Masood’s use of WhatsApp, saying only “this terrorist sent a WhatsApp message and it can’t be accessed.” But her call for a “back door” system to allow authorities to retrieve information is likely to meet resistance from the tech industry, which has faced previous law enforcement demands for access to data after major attacks. In the United States, Apple fought the FBI’s request for the passcodes needed to unlock an iPhone that had been used by one of the perpetrators in the 2015 extremist attack in San Bernardino, California. The FBI initially claimed it could obtain the data only with Apple’s help, but ultimately found another way to hack into the locked phone. Masood drove a rented SUV into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge before smashing it into Parliament’s gates and rushing onto the grounds, where he fatally stabbed a policeman and was shot by other officers. A detailed police reconstruction has found the entire attack lasted 82 seconds.

British police ar... Police are trying to pinpoint his motive and identify any possible accomplices, making the WhatsApp message a potential clue to his state of mind and his social media contacts. Rudd said attacks like Masood’s would be easier to prevent if authorities could penetrate encrypted services after obtaining warrants similar to the ones used to listen in on telephone calls or -- in snail mail days -- to steam open letters and read their contents. Without a change in the system, she said terrorists would be able to communicate with each other without fear of being overheard even in cases where a legal warrant has been obtained. Rudd also urged technology companies to do a better job at preventing the publication of material that promotes extremism. She plans to meet with firms Thursday about setting up an industry board that would take steps to make the web less useful to extremists. British police investigating the attack say they still believe Masood, a 52-year-old Briton, acted alone and say they have no indications that further attacks are planned. London attacker’s unusual background raises questions for investigators Metropolitan Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu said it may never be possible to fully determine Masood’s motives. “That understanding may have died with him,” Basu said Saturday night as police appealed for people who knew Masood or saw him to contact investigators. “Even if he acted alone in the preparation, we need to establish with absolute clarity why he did these unspeakable acts, to bring reassurance to Londoners.” Play Video CBS Evening News London attacker's unusual background raises questions Khalid Masood, the man behind Wednesday's London attack, was 52 years old, much older than most terrorists. That and other factors are puzzling a... The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), which is losing territory in Iraq and Syria but still has radical followers in other parts of the world, has claimed Masood was a “soldier” carrying out its wishes to attack Western countries. Masood had convictions for violent crimes in the U.K. and spent time in prison. He also worked in Saudi Arabia teaching English for two years and traveled there again in 2015 on a visa designed for religious pilgrimages. Along with the man arrested Sunday, a 58-year-old man detained in Birmingham several days ago remains in custody in the case. Nine others arrested after the attack have been freed without charges, while one person was released on bail. The family of slain police officer Keith Palmer, meanwhile, released a statement thanking those who tried to save his life. “There was nothing more you could have done. You did your best and we are just grateful he was not alone,” the statement said. © 2017 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Nokia Seeks International Judicial Assistance to Obtain Documents & Deposition Testimony from Samsung in their Case against Apple | Main | Apple Continues their Race with Competitors for Hardware and Augmented Reality Applications » March 26, 2017 Samsung Invents a Future Smartwatch with a Unique Secondary Rim Display   Last week the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office published a patent application from Samsung that puts a new twist to flexible displays. Up until now Samsung's Patents relating to flexible displays have been primarily in context with future bendable, foldable and/or scrollable smartphones and tablets. On Thursday a Samsung patent came to light that illustrated a secondary display being added to the rim of Samsung's Gear smartwatch.    Samsung's main patent figure below illustrates a future smartwatch with a side display to provide users with "simple information, such as a current date, a current weather, a current playing song, etc."   Today Samsung's rotary dial around the watch is used to allow the user to easily change apps they wish to use. Now the rotary dial will also be an illuminated display so users can receive simple information at a quick glance with the side display.   Earlier this month Patently Apple posted a report titled "IDC sees the Smartwatch eventually dominating the Wearables Market due to an Explosion of new Form Factors & Niches." The report pointed to concepts by Apple and Samsung that involved a large flexible display in the form of a digital bracelet as noted below that could easily be a replacement or alternative smartwatch design in the future.   Before Samsung can make the leap to larger and wider flexible display for a future smartwatch as noted above, their current patent regarding the addition of a flexible display around their rotary dial is where the concept can safely debut.   On that note the smartwatch concept looks very promising over the next few years as flexible display technology advances to the point of allowing displays to take on a stable rotary or circular form factor. The smartwatch market today remains a large niche market. In order to move it to a mass-market, designs have to go beyond the traditional look. In fact I believe that tech leaders like Apple and Samsung will eventually blur the line and create a hybrid between a smartwatch and a smartphone that could really excite the market.    For more on this invention, see Patently Mobile's full report here.

(NASDAQ: AAPL) added 65 cents last week (about 0.5%), closing at $140.64 on Friday. The stock posted a new 52-week high on Tuesday. Apple launched a number of new products Tuesday morning and that sent the stock to its new annual high. By the end of the day, however, the shares closed down more than $2.00. The product announcements included the introduction of a new, lower-priced 9.7-inch iPad that may be telegraphing the eventual demise of the iPad mini. Apple also introduced a new version of its entry-level iPhone SE. The new SE, with 32GB of memory and an A9 processor, will sell for $399. With 128GB of memory the SE will cost $499. That’s about half the expected price of the new iPhone 8 expected to be introduced in the fall. Apple also announced the acquisition of a productivity app for iOS and Android called Workflow. The app allows users easily to create complex macro commands to help automate routine chores. The price was not disclosed and the app, which had previously cost $1.99, appeared in the App Store as a free download. Apple’s market cap is now over $736 billion, up about $2 billion in the past week. Between last May, when the stock dropped to a 52-week low, and last week, the shares have added just over 57%. Apple shares closed at $140.64 on Friday in a 52-week range of $89.47 to $142.80. The consensus 12-month price target is $144.48 in a price target range of $102 to $185 per share.

News Sports Things to Do Life Obituaries e-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive UK: Attacker used WhatsApp, firm must help police get access Sunday Mar 26, 2017 at 1:30 PM Westminster Bridge attacker Khalid Masood sent a WhatsApp message that cannot be accessed because it was encrypted by the popular messaging service, a top British security official said Sunday. The Associated Press Westminster Bridge attacker Khalid Masood sent a WhatsApp message that cannot be accessed because it was encrypted by the popular messaging service, a top British security official said Sunday. British press reports suggest Masood used the messaging service owned by Facebook just minutes before starting a rampage Wednesday that left three pedestrians and one police officer dead and dozens more wounded, including some with catastrophic injuries. Home Secretary Amber Rudd used appearances on BBC and Sky News to urge WhatsApp and other encrypted services to make their platforms accessible to intelligence services and police trying to carrying out lawful eavesdropping. "We need to make sure that organizations like WhatsApp — and there are plenty of others like that — don't provide a secret place for terrorists to communicate with each other," she said. Rudd did not provide any details about Masood's use of WhatsApp, saying only "this terrorist sent a WhatsApp message and it can't be accessed." But her call for a "back door" system to allow authorities to retrieve information is likely to meet resistance from the tech industry, which has faced previous law enforcement demands for access to data after major attacks. In the United States, Apple fought the FBI's request for the passcodes needed to unlock an iPhone that had been used by one of the perpetrators in the 2015 extremist attack in San Bernardino, California. The FBI initially claimed it could obtain the data only with Apple's help, but ultimately found another way to hack into the locked phone. Masood drove a rented SUV into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge before smashing it into Parliament's gates and rushing onto the grounds, where he stabbed a policeman to death before he was shot dead. A detailed police reconstruction has found the entire attack lasted 82 seconds. Police are trying to pinpoint his motive and identify any possible accomplices, making the WhatsApp message a potential clue to his state of mind and his social media contacts. Rudd said attacks like Masood's would be easier to prevent if authorities could penetrate encrypted services after obtaining warrants similar to the ones used to listen in on telephone calls or — in snail mail days — to steam open letters and read their contents. Without a change in the system, she said terrorists would be able to communicate with each other without fear of being overheard even in cases where a legal warrant has been obtained. Rudd also urged technology companies to do a better job at preventing the publication of material that promotes extremism. She plans to meet with firms Thursday about setting up an industry board that would take steps to make the web less useful to extremists. British police investigating the attack say they still believe Masood, a 52-year-old Briton, acted alone and say they have no indications that further attacks are planned. Metropolitan Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu said it may never be possible to fully determine Masood's motives. "That understanding may have died with him," Basu said Saturday night as police appealed for people who knew Masood or saw him to contact investigators. "Even if he acted alone in the preparation, we need to establish with absolute clarity why he did these unspeakable acts, to bring reassurance to Londoners." The Islamic State group, which is losing territory in Iraq and Syria but still has radical followers in other parts of the world, has claimed Masood was a "soldier" carrying out its wishes to attack Western countries. Masood had convictions for violent crimes in the U.K. and spent time in prison. He also worked in Saudi Arabia teaching English for two years and traveled there again in 2015 on a visa designed for religious pilgrimages. One 58-year-old man remains in custody in the case after being arrested in Birmingham, where Masood had been living. He has not been charged or named. Nine others arrested after the assault have been freed without charges and one has been freed on bail. The family of slain police officer Keith Palmer, meanwhile, released a statement thanking those who tried to save his life. "There was nothing more you could have done.

By Rene Ritchie Wednesday, Mar 22, 2017 at 2:37 pm EDT 38 Comments Rene Ritchie has been covering the personal technology industry for almost a decade. Editorial Director at Mobile Nations, analyst at iMore, video and podcast host, you can follow him @reneritchie on Snapchat, Instagram, and Twitter. Unboxing the (Product) RED iPhone 7 Plus — much watch! This is the (Product) RED iPhone 7. And it's gorgeous. It has a really deep, really matte, almost lustrous red anodized finish on the back and sides. Unlike the rose gold and gold iPhones, Apple even color-matched the antenna lines so they all but disappear. I've had a Product (RED) iPod touch for years and this is even... redder. The look is beyond sexy. It's fire 🔥. See at Apple The faceplate is white, which has rankled some people. I totally get it. Black makes the screen look more expansive for dark interfaces, including video and gaming, but a lot of interface is white and bright these days as well, from good old web pages to the new Apple Music and News interfaces. Plus, white just looks lighter to me. I've preferred it since the gold and rose gold iPhones. (Selfishly, it's also easier to photograph since it doesn't show as much dust.) The Touch ID sensor ring is silver. It's supposed to match the silver Apple logo embedded on the back. I get it but, audaciously, I'd have loved a red ring. That way it's apparent from the front that you're not using a silver iPhone but a (Product) RED one. Yes, scratch my surface and what do you find? More. Surface. Like the Jet Black iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, there's no 32 GB version of the (Product) RED, so your buy-in is at the 128 GB or 256 GB price points. Apple did that with the very first white iPhone as well. I'm not sure how much is supply balance and how much is positioning, but color has been shown to drive attraction as much as any new feature. It's also for a good cause. Apple has donated $130 million to (Product) RED to date and a portion of proceeds from this special edition iPhone will be adding to that starting Friday. We'll have much more on the (Product) RED iPhone soon, so stay tuned! (And if you have any questions, drop them in the comments below!)

Not even Job's RDF could get people excited about the mediocrity that Apple puts out these days. At least they finally got rid of the iPad Air name.

As smartphones have become more powerful we've seen peripherals appearing that allow them to double as an actual PC hooked up to a display. The latest of those is a rumored desktop dock for the forthcoming Galaxy S8. Now a patent filed by Apple suggests the iPhone maker is considering a similar thing, only in the form of a dumb laptop enclosure. The Apple patent, discovered by Apple Insider, was filed in September 2016 and is simply titled "Electronic Accessory Device." It's the details that are interesting, though. The accessory device described offers a display, ports, and a control interface, but does not function without the addition of an "electronic host device." As the image included with the patent filing and pictured above shows, the electronic host device looks very much like an iPhone. With Apple laser focused on making devices as thin as possible, this would certainly be a way to make a future MacBook incredibly thin. It wouldn't need any internal components beyond a few interface circuits, the keyboard, ports, and display. Battery power would come from the smartphone, as would the touchpad input courtesy of the screen. Related MacBook Pro 2016: Should You Upgrade? MacBook Pro 2016: Should You Upgrade? Apple does leave scope in the patent for the enclosure to include some additional components such as a GPU and memory. But with the rate at which mobile device performance is increasing, it seems unlikely such additional components would be necessary. One other point to make if this device became a reality: it would be the first Apple laptop effectively running iOS. For now, this is just a patent, and one that will likely remain an Apple idea until a point is reached where MacBook sales are no longer making sense as a separate product, or competitors try something similar for their smartphones and it proves popular.

It's hard to imagine now, with the Apple iPhone and the array of Samsung models around the globe, that there once was a time when Nokia and BlackBerry were kings of the mobile phone industry. Finnish company Nokia made some of the first mobile phones in the 1980s, helped these devices become household items in the early 2000s, and by 2007, had a whopping 41 per cent of the mobile handset market.

All News Movies Games TV Culture Anime March 25, 2017 Reinier Macatangay Super Mario Run plagued by pop ups, but still fun (Android review) Finally, Super Mario Run is out on Android through the Google Play store. For months, it had been exclusive to iOS because of a deal between Nintendo and Apple. Now, Android smartphone users get to enjoy this landmark game. It is a landmark game because for years Nintendo hesitated to enter the smartphone market out of fear no one would buy their own hardware. To compromise, it looks like “casual” versions of top Nintendo franchises are going to be released for Android and iOS, while deeper titles will remain on the Switch and 3DS. It makes sense, as Nintendo can lure a different crowd by using phone games as bait. Is the bait enjoyable? Well, it is a debatable point. Remember how people made fun of modern gaming using the original Super Mario Bros.? Bubbles were placed over Mario’s head to mock the way today’s games lecture players on obvious points. (Credit: hiwiller.com.) Super Mario Run is not too far from the above picture. Forced pop ups and tutorials are present throughout, even past the game’s beginning stages. Simply starting the main game comes across as a frustrating process because of Toad informing the player on nearly everything. Toad is just trying to be helpful, but he starts to become annoying after a few times since every single minuscule detail requires a notice. The little guy just needs to take a breather and wait a bit, as not everyone cares about whatever arrived in a gift box. Plus, the game plagues users at the beginning with a tutorial on jumping and a few other game mechanics. Most casual gamers can figure out the controls to a 2D Mario title on their own. The pop ups are a shame because beneath all the clutter lies a solid game. Sure, the graphical style seems no different than the DS and 3DS New Super Mario Bros. series, but the “automatic runner” premise adds a new dimension to the gameplay. The overall level designs are still good too (although short). Yet, for the older gamer who grew up playing the classic 8-bit Mario games, trying out this entry will be jarring because of the constant hand holding. Perhaps Nintendo should offer an option at startup and let people decide if they want so much help. It would make a lot people happier to not tap so through many options and updates. The main gameplay experience is always most important. Some readers might disagree with the above criticism, and that is fine. Again, underneath the extra distractions is a legitimate Mario series entry for Android and iOS. Going through each level is fun, even if exploring is more difficult since Mario keeps running. As for the extra modes (which Toad will undoubtedly lecture on), Toad Rally is a nice addition. Players compete against other Super Mario Run users around the world, but the opponent is only a “ghost.” In other words, no one is facing off against a live player. The Toad Rally mode is not unwelcome though and adds replayability. The Kingdom Building mode seems less attractive. If players are interested, they can add buildings and other items to the hub world, or rearrange and move things around. Others might find it interesting. One last nitpicking point: the price. Even a few Nintendo fans will find $9.99 too expensive for an automatic runner with short-ish (but well designed) levels. Super Mario Run is not without flaws and the price is high, but with patience, gamers will remember why they love Mario all over again.

In this piece, we’ll talk first about all of the releases that impressed us the most from the bunch, and then we’ll quickly go over all of the rest. Our favorite releases this week Zeal – $0.99 Zeal is an incredible new release that lets you see more about your battery at a glance. It provides you with battery health information that Apple normally doesn’t give you access to, as well as convenient toggle buttons for managing your battery life more efficiently. The interface can be invoked with Activator and can be opened in either alert or banner mode, depending on your personal preference. If you’re a battery monger, and you want to see more advanced information about your device, we recommend checking out Zeal. Our full review has more information about what it has to offer. YouTubeVolume – FREE Apple’s volume HUD is just so awful, and yet the YouTube app has a very nice volume HUD. It seems Google has the right idea, so why not transfer the YouTube volume HUD to everywhere else in iOS? A new free jailbreak tweak called YouTubeVolume brings a YouTube-inspired volume HUD to every other part of iOS, including within apps and on the Home screen. With an improved look and additional accessibility, the tweak makes it easier to watch videos, play full-screen games, and access buttons inside apps without being interrupted. You can read our full review of YouTubeVolume to learn more about how it works. Other releases this week CanYouLikeNot: Prevents the passcode screen from automatically showing after resprings (free – review) CCNoFloating: Animates the Control Center like before iOS 10 (free) CustomLockscreenDuration: Lets you choose the sleep timer for the Lock screen (free – review) MailClientDefault10: Lets you choose a default email app on your iPhone or iPad (free – review) MaskMe10: Hides the text and sender’s name from banner notifications from Messages (free – review) NotifyCensored: Lets you censor the details of notifications from certain apps (free – review) PPTPFix: Lets you use native PPTP VPN on iOS 10 (free) ringUI: Makes parts of iOS square instead of round (free – review) SafariEnhancer10: Tools for customizing Safari to make it the way you want it to be (free) Unicus: Tools for customizing your Lock screen (free) WidgeficationX (iOS 10): Lets you adjust the transparency effects of widgets and banners throughout iOS 10 (free – review) Although that wraps it up for this week’s roundup, we make these posts every week.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) rumor mill today is news of hackers allegedly obtaining AAPL users’ ID credentials. Today, we’ll look at that and other Apple Rumors for Wednesday. iPhone Hack: A group of hackers are attempting to blackmail Apple, reports BGR. This group of hackers is called “Turkish Crime Family” and they are seeking $75,000 in Bitcoin or Ethereum. The group also says it will accept $100,000 worth of iTunes gift cards from the company. The hackers claim to have obtained the credentials for anywhere from 300 million to 559 million AAPL email accounts. They are threatening to remote wipe millions of iPhone devices on April 7 if the tech company doesn’t give in to their demands. Red iPhone China: Apple isn’t using the PRODUCT(RED) branding for its new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus variations in China, 9to5Mac notes. It is unknown why the branding has been removed from the devices in China, but it may have to do with the controversial nature of AIDS in the country. When asked about the change, AAPL CEO Tim Cook said that the company donates a portion of all iPhone sales from every country to the (RED) charity. Red iPhone Unboxing: The first unboxing video for Apple’s new red iPhone 7 Plus is now up, reports MacRumors. The video was posted by YouTuber Marques Brownlee. He shows off the packaging for the device and it appears to look like most other iPhone 7 packaging. However, it does have a red iPhone 7 Plus on the front and the text is also red. Inside the box is a red iPhone 7 Plus, a Lightning cable and a pair of Lightning EarPods.

More Buybacks? What You Need To Know Ahead Of Apple's Next Earnings Call Shanthi Rexaline , Benzinga Staff Writer   {{following ? "Following" : "Follow"}} March 26, 2017 10:45am   Comments Share: Related AAPL New Data Show Why Smartphones May One Day Dethrone TV As The Supreme Screen JPMorgan's Hall Explains How Wall Street Under Appreciates Apple's Story Stocks Rebound From Heavy Losses, Nasdaq Break-Even; Snap Gets 'Buy' Rating (Investor's Business Daily) Musing over what Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) might reveal on its fiscal year second quarter earnings call, due in April, RBC Capital Markets asked investors to brace for details on its capital allocation process. In a note Friday, RBC said it thinks Apple will raise its dividend by 10-15 percent, implying yield of 2 percent, and increase its buyback authorization further. The Case of Abounding Cash & Return of Cash Analysts Amit Daryanani and Mitch Steves believe Apple could announce and sustain a $50+ billion annual capital allocation program, in the absence of capital repatriation, given that the company's net cash position has increased to $159 billion from $153 billion in December 2015. While noting the company bought back shares at a rate of $6 billion per quarter over the past 12 quarters and that it has $31 billion in underutilized authorization under the current program, the firm said the company could increase the authorization by $35 billion to $40 billion, which could be used over the next six to eight quarters. Using Up the Free Cash Flow RBC expects the company to generate $57 billion in free cash flow in 2017 and then sustain 10 percent growth going forward. The firm assumes roughly 38 percent of the free cash flow is being generated in the U.S. and the remainder $36 billion from overseas. Accordingly, the firm sees scope for a 15 percent increase in dividend, financed by the domestic free cash flow. The firm thinks Apple could talk about a dividend payout target as a long-term discussion and something that could be a reality under cash repatriation. Given that Apple's 25 percent payout lags the large-cap tech peers' 50 percent yield, the firm sees the company closing in on the gap, if repatriation occurs. Attractive Large-cap Asset RBC said Apple remains an attractive large-cap asset to own, given iPhone 8 supercycle, capital allocation & repatriation, and services growth. RBC has an Outperform rating and $155 price target for shares of Apple.

View all partners Republish this article Republish our articles for free, online or in print, under Creative Commons license. Estonian e-Residency. Author Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger Estonia is a small country in the Baltic region of Northern Europe with a population of 1.3 million and a GDP of US $23 billion, roughly 10% of Apple’s annual earnings. Since its independence from Russia in 1991, Estonia has been rapidly implementing a digital economy. It established online voting in 2007, has provided many government services online, has medical records and prescriptions online and has a fibre broadband network that gives it average speeds similar to those of Korea. Perhaps the most radical move by the Estonian Government was to introduce an e-Residency program in 2014 which would allow anyone from around the world to become a virtual citizen and start, and run, a business from Estonia. Applying for e-Residency is simply a matter of filling out an online form, uploading a copy of a passport and a photo, and paying a 100 Euro fee. The application process takes about 4 weeks, during which time a police background check is run. Once approved, it is necessary to turn up at a collection point, usually an Estonian embassy, and collect a smart card that is loaded with a digital certificate representing an e-Resident’s digital identity. Every e-Resident is given an official email address @eesti.ee and is then able to use one of the many services to set up a company and bank account in the country, although the bank requires the person opening the account to visit Estonia at least once to open the account. One of the benefits of establishing a company in Estonia is that there is no corporate tax on money that is left within the company. Since its inception, there has been 17,000 e-Residencies approved with the majority originating in Finland, Russia and the USA. 1,380 new companies have been established by e-Residents, mostly in the technology area but covering a range of other activities. There has been a surge in interest from the UK since the vote to leave the EU with an Estonian e-Residency seen as one way of retaining the ability to operate within the economic zone. The aim is to have 10 million e-Residents by 2025 and so there is still a way to go to reach that number but the concept has created a constant stream of visitors from other countries trying to learn about the programme. The idea of a “cloud country” that follows the same principles of cloud computing or cloud data storage is one that resonates with all sorts of possibilities. Firstly, it acknowledges that as far as our lives on the Internet are concerned, the idea of nationality has less meaning as we are able to interact with any one, at any time, with almost any service, around the globe. Physical restrictions that are imposed by geography, like licensing of content for example, can be circumvented through the use of VPNs connecting through to any country at will. Once a business is online, it can operate globally with relative ease, handling different currencies and different tax requirements transparently. Even language is no longer a barrier with services like Google Translate becoming increasingly fluent. The Internet and social networks have created and facilitated global communities that are organised by common interests and ideals rather than the main driver of national identity: physical location. Like Amazon has done with its computing technology, Estonia has put its government services online and made spare capacity available for others outside its country. It has stopped short of extending the benefits and services offered to e-Residents but that is really only a matter of time as e-Residents contribute increasing amounts of revenue to the country. e-Residency doesn’t give the holder any additional rights to enter the country or the EU, but considering that travel is sometimes a necessity for business at least, it makes sense to provide e-Residents with some form of access to travel freely within the European Union. In researching this article, I applied for an Estonian e-Residency whilst in Helsinki at the Slush startup festival in November, 2016. Once accepted, to pick up the identity card, I had to travel to the Estonian Embassy in Canberra, Australia from Perth where I live. Walking through Australian bush on a hot day was a far cry from the subzero temperatures of Helsinki. Having returned home, e-Residency has now thankfully moved online.

She accused the tech firms of giving terrorists a ‘place to hide’ by using ‘end-to-end encryption’ in their messaging. The Home Secretary complained Google was making it too easy to find material helpful to terrorists, like ‘stabbing instructions’. She said she’d ask “the best people who understand the technology, who understand the necessary hashtags, to stop this stuff even being put up.” Read More Secret text message ordered the 'lone wolf' to carry out London terror attack And she called for them to work with government to allow a ‘back door’ into their services so spooks can read the messages. There’s just one problem with that… (Photo: REUTERS) Here’s how end-to-end encryption works End-to-end encryption means messages can only be decoded by the sender or receiver. They use a publicly available algorithm to scramble and unscramble the message on the phone itself, rather than the encryption being done by the service provider. The upshot of this is that Apple, WhatsApp, Telegram and other services that use the technology could not decrypt messages sent through their services if they wanted to. Read More "A pathetic Poundland terrorist in an estate car with a knife": BBC's Andrew Neil slams London terror attacker Later, on Sky News, Sophy Ridge pointed out backdoors were incompatible with end-to-end encryption. The Home Secretary insisted, both forcefully and wrongly, that they were not incompatible. Would it be so bad if we didn't have end-to-end encryption? (Photo: PA) Well, it depends on whether you like having your bank account hacked. Allowing a back door into end-to-end encryption wouldn’t just make it less secure for terrorists - it’d make loads of things you do online every day more vulnerable to attacks from hackers. This kind of security is not only used by messaging services. It’s used, entirely legitimately, by banks, card companies and healthcare providers to protect users from hackers. And making them less secure for terrorists makes them less secure for everyone. It’s a bit like the government telling locksmiths to make everyone’s front door locks less secure so the police can pick them more quickly in an emergency.

Olivia Solis/SHARE Foundation These days just about every device is "smart." There are smart cars, phones, TVs, grills and speakers, and most people don't think twice about buying a new TV, hooking it up to the internet and giving it access to different apps. But all that connectivity means data is being shared and collected by the devices and the apps used. All Tech Considered Internet Freedom Wanes As Governments Target Messaging, Social Apps Earlier this month, Consumer Reports announced a new initiative to create standards for consumer privacy and security protections that will later allow them to rate products and services and see how well consumer information is protected. To do this, CR is partnering with Ranking Digital Rights, a nonprofit that specializes in evaluating privacy standards of telecom and internet companies. In other words, they carefully read through all the privacy agreements most others accept without question. "What we're looking in the Ranking Digital Rights Corporate Accountability Index is companies' public commitments and disclosures about what their policies are affecting users' privacy as well as their freedom of expression, and the company's general governance," says Rebecca MacKinnon, director of Ranking Digital Rights. "So, do they have institutional mechanisms in place to make sure that all their managers and employees are thinking about their users rights in the course of day to day operations?" All Tech Considered As We Leave More Digital Tracks, Amazon Echo Factors In Murder Investigation This year's rankings were the first that included Apple and Samsung, two large industry players. Despite their influence in the markets, both companies received failing grades. "They disclose less information than you'd expect, which we believe is a baseline for companies to demonstrate to users what's happening to their information, with whom it's being shared, both in terms of governments, but also commercially," MacKinnon says. "Apple has no transparency about its rules about what can and can't be in the app store, or about what kind of government requests they're getting to remove content from the app store." But really none of the companies received a grade above a D, with the top two companies being Google and Microsoft. TED YouTube "It's not necessarily that they're doing all the right things, but at least they're telling us what their policies are to a greater degree than the other companies," MacKinnon says. "They're disclosing more data about the kinds of things they're handing over to the government, the kinds of content that they're removing both in response to external demands but also forcing terms of service and they also have strong governance." Digital Ranking Rights also looks at freedom of expression and how transparent companies are in terms of what content users can access. Issues like this made news at the beginning of year when The New York Times' app was blocked in China. MacKinnon says a lot of companies have started transparency reporting, or releasing data about the number of requests they're getting to block and remove content as a form of censorship. All Tech Considered Privacy Paradox: What You Can Do About Your Data Right Now "The relationship between the law and human rights is complicated," MacKinnon says. "In pretty much all countries you have governments demanding that companies do things that based on international human right standards of free expression or privacy are violating privacy rights. And companies are caught in the middle." While transparency is important, legal requirements for companies to disclose this information don't exist at this time. "What's really important is that companies be transparent so people know who to hold accountable," MacKinnon says. "If your content is being removed or you're being prevented from accessing certain information you need to know who is responsible for that decision." MacKinnon says companies need to be more transparent, so users can decide for themselves what, if any, actions they can and want to take. "In the very least if they're in a country where they can influence the policy, then as citizens and voters, they can try and do so," she says. "They can try and hold their political leaders accountable. If they're not in a place where they can influence the policy, they can at least make more informed decisions about how they're going to use the technology and how they're going to protect themselves." The Two-Way U.S. Senate Votes To Repeal Obama-Era Internet Privacy Rules Self-protection is on the minds of many people, especially after stories of baby monitors and cars being hacked surfaced. Seamus Tuohy, a consultant with the digital security firm Prudent innovation says there are some ways to keep data secure and personal information private, especially when using mobile devices. Tuohy says while it's possible to get virus from clicking on a link, it's less likely to happen when you visit a site than when you download a file and open it. Another good practice Tuohy suggests is checking to see if the site is secure. If begins with "https," the "s" means the site is secure. Tuohy says this is easier to check on laptops or other computers than on apps, but he says if a company's main website is secure, there's a good chance the company took the same security precautions in its app. This type of app and site security also matters to people who are concerned about connecting to public Wi-Fi networks. "These days about half the websites on the internet are secured this way and that protects from the Wi-Fi hotspot or from the mobile network seeing what you're going to," Tuohy says. "They can see the basic site you're on when you go to a browser ... but they can't see what you're searching for." As for the cases of hackers taking control of cameras on computers, Tuohy says he personally would choose to cover up the camera with a small piece of paper or plastic cover.

Ro Khanna, who came to eastern Kentucky to see what the tech industry and Appalachia can offer each other. By Nancy Scola 03/26/17 07:19 AM EDT Updated 03/27/17 10:50 AM EDT Rep. Ro Khanna and Appalachian Regional Commission Co-Chairman Earl Gohl chat as they head from the Big Sandy Community and Technical College main building in Paintsville, Ky., to the Interapt coding bootcamp across the street. | John Shinkle/POLITICO Facebook Twitter Google + Email Comment Print PAINTSVILLE, Kentucky — President Donald Trump won this state by a landslide after promising to reopen Appalachia’s coal mines and put its miners back to work. But here, along the banks of Paint Creek in eastern Kentucky’s legendary coal fields, some displaced workers are pinning their hopes instead on Silicon Valley. And the celebrity of the moment is California Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna, who came from the Valley’s deep-blue heart last week to see what this emptying corner of coal country might have to offer the technology industry — and how Appalachia can reap its benefits in the form of jobs and tech training. Story Continued Below "It's just exciting for them to think what we're doing is interesting enough to make the trip," former coal worker and budding app developer Steve Bowling said in a cinder-block classroom in Paintsville — referring to Khanna and, by extension, the tech industry itself. "That means a whole lot to us." The 40-year-old freshman congressman and son of Indian immigrants might seem an unlikely ambassador to a conservative region: He supports what he calls “common-sense” gun laws, not to mention the Obama-era energy regulations that the coal industry blames for shuttering dozens of coal plants in the past decade. But he hopes that by expounding upon the Silicon Valley success story across the U.S., he might help boost the economic prospects of places like Paintsville. And if he can convey the woes of non-coastal regions to leaders back home, the tech industry might find a way to steer where the country goes from here. “The election was a wakeup call about how much discontent there is from technological progress and globalization, that it’s not just all a clear good thing,” Khanna said in his still-bare Capitol Hill office just before his trip, where he visited a training program for mobile app developers at Big Sandy Community & Technical College. And it’s time, he said, for an industry that has played a role in shedding American jobs — by advancing artificial intelligence, among other things — to invest in helping communities like this one share in the upside. “There’s got to be greater empathy among those in Silicon Valley for some of the pain that has been caused,” he said. At the same time, he’s looking to spread Silicon Valley’s aspirational spirit around a country in need of big thinking. “It's just getting people to dream that they can go try to be like Elon Musk or Steve Jobs,” Khanna said. The 43-room mansion of John C. Mayo, a teacher-turned-entrepreneur regarded as the father of the eastern Kentucky coal industry, is now the home of Our Lady of the Mountains School. | John Shinkle/POLITICO Khanna came here at the invitation Kentucky Rep. Hal Rogers¸ a 79-year-old Republican who joined Congress the year Ronald Reagan moved into the White House. Rogers' sprawling district is among the poorest in the country — ranked 432nd out of 435 in median per-capita income according to the Almanac of American Politics — and the setting for the best-selling guide-to-Trump-country "Hillbilly Elegy." By contrast, companies including Apple, Intel, eBay, Yahoo, LinkedIn and Tesla are all stuffed within Khanna’s overwhelmingly Democratic, wealthy and compact district; Google, while headquartered in nearby Mountain View, has offices there, too. Republican Gov. Matt Bevin and Megan Smith, the Google executive who served as Barack Obama’s U.S. chief technology officer, also came to the event, giving speeches and chatting over foam-containered chicken salad sandwiches and potato chips. But for the crowd of about 150 people, Khanna's attention was what they craved. Rogers was eager to have him in what he calls “Silicon Holler,” because Khanna has quickly become a one-man proxy for a swath of glitteringly brand-name and geographically concentrated Silicon Valley companies. “It’s a chance for us to sell him, and therefore them, that this is a place to look at," said Rogers. That he's actually come, joked Earl Gohl, co-chairman of the Appalachian Regional Commission — founded in 1963 by President John F. Kennedy — makes Khanna his “new best friend.” Still, shortly after he stepped off stage with Khanna, Rogers fielded a question on whether he holds any bad feelings over the tech industry’s growing disdain for coal, such as Facebook’s new hydropowered data center in Luleå, Sweden. His answer? If the goal is keeping Appalachian people in the rolling hills of Paintsville and Pikesville and Harlan County, not fleeing to places like Ypsilanti and Cincinnati, America’s tech boom might be the last best hope. “We can't afford to be too resentful," said the Republican. “We'd rather sleep here.” Republican Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin, Rep. Hal Rogers (R-Ky.), former U.S. CTO Megan Smith, Rep. Ro Khanna and Appalachian Regional Commission Co-Chairman Earl Gohl chat March 13 before a round table luncheon on developing Eastern Kentucky from a coal based economy to a "Silicon Holler." | John Shinkle/POLITICO Khanna, a lawyer and former official in the Obama-era Commerce Department, came to the tan-bricked, 1950s-built community college, where every other car in the parking lot is a hulking, mud-spattered American-made pickup truck. Founded in 1790 as Paint Lick Station, this is a town that honors its coal history. The bricked-and-columned 43-room mansion built on the cusp of World War I by John C. Mayo, the teacher-turned-entrepreneur regarded as the father of the eastern Kentucky coal industry, stands a block over. It’s now Our Lady of the Mountains School. But gone are the days where you could get a $70,000 job in the mines with a ninth-grade education and buy one of the lovely homes dotting the hills here. Since 2008, coal jobs in eastern Kentucky have dropped from more than 14,000 to fewer than 4,000. And even the jobs still available don't look like a smart long-term bet, making scraping out a living underground even less attractive than it's ever been. The event on display here, convened more or less in Khanna's honor, amounted to speeches, a roundtable discussion and demonstrations about a program called TechHire Eastern Kentucky, or TEKY — pronounced, conveniently, "techie." The program, backed by $2.75 million in federal funds, trains a crop of would-be mobile app developers for four months and puts them in a four-month paid internship with a Louisville software company called Interapt. (That money flowed through the Appalachian Regional Commission, which Trump, in his first budget, included on the list of agencies he’d completely defund. Rogers called those cuts “draconian, careless and counterproductive.”) TechHire, begun as a federal program in the Obama White House in 2015, was inspired by the tech industry's complaint that it has 600,000 job openings it can't fill, a major drag on its bottom line and ambitions, and part of its justification for seeking more visas for specialized workers from overseas. But the people who have brought Khanna argue that this crunch exists partly because the industry simply doesn’t hirethe sort of people sitting in cinder-block classrooms in eastern Kentucky. The former coal worker Bowling, 41, said his wife found out about TEKY on Facebook after he’d beenlaid off from a job in a coal mine filling blasting holes with ammonium nitrate. He chose the Android app training track over the more structured Apple iOS trackbecause his instructors "described it as, 'It's the Wild Wild West.'" Others have come to the program to avoid coal. Sean Crowl, 29, says he lost his job when the Kmart in town closed. Crowl sat at a roundtable of young men — the class of 35 trainees, from a pool of 800 applicants, is overwhelming male and white — who came from a bank, a school, a restaurant or unemployment to build apps like one for a local nonprofit that helps track elementary school students' reading progress. The $400 a week was appealing, as a two-bedroom apartment can be had here at that price. (One trainee says it was so good he thought it was a "scam" until he heard about the paycheck.) All six said four months was plenty of time to learn how to build apps good enough for the Google Play marketplace or Apple's App Store. Interapt CEO Ankur Gopal and Rep. Ro Khanna speak with trainees in the TechHire Eastern Kentucky coding program at the local campus of Big Sandy Community and Technical College on March 13. | John Shinkle/POLITICO The pitch Rogers and others are making here is that Silicon Valley hiring managers would be smart to open their eyes to places beyond San Francisco and New York — and they’re pitchingeastern Kentucky as the type of undervalued investment that venture capitalists love to go on about. They argue that the internet erases some of the region's traditional limitations, such as a dearth of well-maintained roads in many places, as well as of flat ground for building factories. The people say they are hard-working and open to low wages. And unlike, say, Bangalore, it's in a reasonable time zone. But for all the tech industry’s talk of meritocracy, "when employers say they can't hire people with skills, what they're really saying is that they can't find people with a certain pedigree," said Byron Auguste, a former deputy director of the White House National Economic Council who helped create TechHire. Auguste is now president of Opportunity@Work, the non-profit group administering the program. The result, he said, is that people from places like Paintsville don't get access to the enormous sums that companies like those in Khanna's district invest in training. "People are on the outside looking in, forever," Augustesaid. “People say, ‘How many former coal miners can learn to code?’ And my answer is, it’s too early to tell. Only a handful have been given an opportunity, and they’ve done pretty damn well.” Of Khanna, Auguste said: “We want him to be able to go back to Silicon Valley and his constituent companies and say, ‘No joke, there’s really a lot of talent here.’" Being taken seriously is, in fact, a recurring theme. Interapt CEO Ankur Gopal wants Khanna to see that what's going on here isn't some “cute thing.” Jared Arnett, executive director of Shaping Our Appalachian Region, quotes a colleague saying he wants to prove “we're not just a dancing bear.” Khanna said he's listening. "The tech companies and tech industry have an incentive to rethink their own labor practices so that they aren't just hiring in Stanford and Santa Clara, but are broader about what their hiring practices are and the skills they need," he said. That said, Khanna told the crowd in Paintsville, "it has to be a partnership. I don't think it's an act of Silicon Valley's charity. It's in their interest to harness the talent, the energy and the spirit here. That's going to make their companies better. That's going to make our country better." And that, says Khanna, is what he's going to go back and tell the tech industry. The event includedno talk of Trump, his campaign pledge to “bring those miners back” or the attackshe's heaped on the tech industry for everything from manufacturing its products abroad to refusing to open up its consumer products to law enforcement. But Auguste said the warm feelings for the tech industry evident at Big Sandy Community College aren't widely distributed across the U.S. “The country should love Silicon Valley. It’s a gem and a treasure,” he said. “But when push comes to shove, in a lot of parts of the country, it’s difficult to find people who’d say, ‘Silicon Valley has done much for me.’” Khanna said he also wants to help his own home-district industry expand its thinking on Silicon Valley’s role in society. “What I want to do is to help shape the thinking of the Valley to start caring more and engaging more in policy that's not narrow,” Khanna said. “You get almost the same talking points about [tax] repatriation, encryption, patent trolls. I say, ‘What an impoverished vision for a place that literally believes it wants to change human civilization.'"

But earlier this month, it rose to the occasion when a four-year-old needed help in an emergency. Little Roman, a resident of the Kenley district in Croydon in the UK, found his mother lying motionless on the floor in their home on March 7. When he was unable to wake her, he found her iPhone, pressed her thumb to the home button to invoke Siri and asked for help. You can hear the audio from Roman’s call below. “This event was off the charts” Gary Vaynerchuk was so impressed with TNW Conference 2016 he paused mid-talk to applaud us. FIND OUT WHY Roman was connected to an operator at emergency services (the number to call in the UK is 999), who took note of the situation and dispatched officers and paramedics to his address within 13 minutes of receiving the call as well as his location. The team was able to give Roman’s mother life-saving first aid and take her to the hospital after she regained consciousness. Although it was mostly Roman’s presence of mind that saved his mother’s life in this case, the story highlights one of the important aspects of voice assistants: accessibility. It isn’t clear if the young child would’ve been able to dial the number for emergency services on his own (or if he’d even have access to an unlocked phone), but it was lucky that he had found a way to call for help. This raises questions about how voice assistants, which are now being embedded in connected speakers, should interpret commands from family members, and whether they should be able to do things like reaching emergency support services – whether that’s a state-run program or an adult family member’s number. Currently Amazon Alexa and Google Home can be used with a free service called Ask My Buddy to send an alert to a contact you specify; you can also use IFTTT recipes to text your family’s GroupMe chat. But it’d great to see companies do more to help users call for help in times of trouble, regardless of their age or whether their voices are recognized by connected devices. Last July, Google added a neat feature to Android which beams your location to emergency services automatically when you call them. At launch, it was activated across the UK and Estonia, and was scheduled to release worldwide. Features like this will take a lot of work to implement across the globe, as different countries use a wide range of systems for their emergency services. Hopefully, Roman’s story will get them thinking about ways to simplify the task of calling for help – before it’s too late.

But Samsung mobile chief DJ Koh has publicly confirmed that the Note series will indeed return with the Galaxy Note 8 later this year, with Koh suggesting that this device will be “better, better, safer and very innovative”. Galaxy Note 8 Schematic leaked It is some time until we can expect the Galaxy Note 8 to appear, with the device expected to be released in August. But leaks this week have provided the first solid information on this forthcoming device. A Chinese website has published a schematic drawing of the Galaxy Note 8, while specs of the device are also included. Of course, this must be taken with a pinch of salt, but the consensus of the Android-following community is that the leak seems fairly authentic. The story has been picked up by Slashleaks, with the publication suggesting that the Galaxy Note 8 will be a 6.4-inch phablet. It is also believed that Samsung will finally bow to popular pressure and imbue the smartphone with 4K resolution. A dual-edged curved display is also predicted for this next generation mobile; a design feature which had previously been prominent in the Galaxy S7 Edge. Among the reported specs is also the suggestion that the Galaxy Note 8 will be powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor, at least in the Western marketplace. Samsung will be, once again, relying on its own proprietary hardware in East Asia, with an Exynos 8895 processor fitted in Galaxy Note 8 units intended for this region. RAM increase Slashleaks also suggests that the Galaxy Note 8 will feature 6GB of RAM memory. This is a quantity that has been linked with the Galaxy S8, but it is now believed that Samsung will instead opt for merely 4GB. This would enable the corporation to distinguish between the two devices, with the Galaxy Note 8 once again being provided with superior specs, as well as the inclusion of the popular S Pen stylus. One spec linked with the Galaxy Note 8 from this particular leak that may not come to fruition is the suggestion that there will be 256GB of expandable internal storage. More likely is that the Galaxy Note 8 will feature 64GB of storage, with the usual micro SD provision available. Home button gone More interesting to note is the design of the Galaxy Note 8 in the schematic drawing, with the Home button conspicuous by its absence. It has long been anticipated that both Samsung and Apple will remove this familiar feature from releases in 2017, and this latest leak certainly seems to confirm this likelihood with the Galaxy Note 8. Other physical reorganisation is also visible in the schematic, with the front camera sensor along with an iris sensor seemingly present on top of the device. The bottom of the unit will house the speaker system included, with anlaysts generally expecting a stereo sound setup to make the most of Samsung having purchased the Harman Kardon brand. Bixby button An interesting inclusion is a dedicated button to launch the debuting Bixby personal assistant. It will be interesting to see precisely what functionality this new software innovation delivers when the Galaxy S8 is launched in the coming weeks. Perhaps by the time of the Galaxy Note 8, this feature will have been significantly refined, but we will still get an indication of the capabilities of the AI in the Galaxy Note 8 from its S8 cousin. Meanwhile, the schematic also predicts that Samsung will include a slot in this device to house the stylus, while a USB type-C port is also noticeable. It is intriguing to note that that the 3.5mm headphone jack that Apple was willing to jettison in the iPhone 7 is still part of the Galaxy Note 8 design, at least in this schematic. Whether this will actually come to fruition remains to be seen, but it could be that Samsung has been paying particular heed to the vocal opposition among some Apple users to the abandonment of this traditional feature. Two models Another report this week has suggested that Samsung will release two models of the Galaxy Note 8 when the phablet hits the stores. This would seem to be a very credible suggestion, as the smartphone marketplace is becoming increasingly fragmented, forcing even the major players to cover as many bases as possible. Apple is widely expected to release three iPhone models simultaneously for the first time in its history this year, and Samsung will quite possibly follow suit in diversifying the Galaxy Note 8 range. Nonetheless, analysts believe that the Galaxy Note 8 models will both feature dual-edged curved displays similar to that of the existing Galaxy S7 Edge. This obviously means that there will be no flatscreen Galaxy Note 8, but it shouldn’t be a huge problem considering the popularity of Samsung’s curved display technology. Dream and Dream 2 The Guardian newspaper in Britain reports that the codenames of the two Galaxy Note 8 phablets are Dream and Dream 2, with the latter apparently the smaller of the two smartphones. The displays included in the two devices curve down both the right and left sides of the mobile, while The Guardian also reveals other aspects of the design. In particular, the larger displays included in these designs can be attributed to the bezel-less design linked with the Galaxy Note 8. This approach is so distinctive that it will be impossible to even etch a Samsung logo into the front of the device. Even the top and bottom bezels, as imagined by this report, are considered to be extremely small, with it also necessary for the fingerprint scanner to be relocated to the rear of the device. The exploding battery of the Galaxy Note 7 has undoubtedly placed pressure on Samsung to deliver with the Galaxy Note 8. But it also seems that the company looks on this as an opportunity to reimagine what this phablet represents and delivers.         LATEST STORIES (4) Syrian Army Forces Strike Terrorists' Defense Lines in Maarzaf, North of Hama Syrian Pro-Gov't Forces Regain Territory in Counter-Offensive near Mahardah Syria: Over 250 Gunmen Leave Key District in Homs City Iraqi Security Forces Resume Anti-Terrorist Operation in Western Mosul Nuclear Disarmament: The Myth of UN Conference…Again Iran, My Beautiful Country: Nowruz Passengers in Shiraz Syrian Army Scores more Victories against ISIL along Aleppo-Raqqa Highway Syrian Troops Block ISIL Terrorists in Northeast Aleppo amid Fighting Syrian Armed Forces Hit Terrorists' Centers Hard West of Aleppo Province Syria: Kurdish-Led Fighters Push ISIL back from More Positions in Western Raqqa Senior Terrorist Commander Killed in Clashes with Syrian Army in Hama Syrian Army Discovers US-Made Arms in Terrorists' Positions in Aleppo Province Syrian Army Makes Fresh Advances in Eastern Damascus, Kills Hundreds of Terrorists Syria: Hundreds of Gunmen, Family Members Leave Key District in Homs Syrian Army Wards off Terrorists' Attack in Northern Homs Syrian Army Forces Strike Terrorists' Defense Lines in Maarzaf, North of Hama TEHRAN (FNA)- The Syrian army units and their allies eliminated dozens of Nusra terrorists' vehicles and killed a number of militants during an assault near the town of Maarzaf in the Northwestern part of Hama province.

By David Snelling David Snelling PUBLISHED: 08:16, Mon, Mar 27, 2017 | UPDATED: 08:17, Mon, Mar 27, 2017 It’s a big year for the iPhone as this revolutionary device has just celebrated its 10th birthday. The very first smartphone from Apple was unveiled by Steve Jobs in January 2007 and this big anniversary could mean the US technology firm is planning some major changes. Apple is expected to pull-out all the stops for its next generation phone, which looks likely to be unveiled in September. The Apple iPhone 8, which may actually be called the iPhone X, is rumoured to be arriving with a stunning dual-curved OLED display, all-glass design, improved dual-cameras, and no physical Home Button – a first for the device. Apple CEO Tim Cook is clearly in no rush to extinguish the growing hype around the forthcoming 10th anniversary iPhone. GABOR BALOUGHA concept image of the iPhone 8 has appeared online Apple iPhone 8 - Leaked photos, concept images, and renders Sun, January 1, 2017 iPhone 8 is shaping up to be one of the most impressive Apple smartphones to date, with glass panels on the front and rear of the device, a curved borderless OLED display and no Home Button Play slideshow VENIAMIN GESKIN • TWITTER • CONCEPT IMAGES 1 of 21 Apple iPhone 8 will debut a brand-new all-glass look, with a curved OLED display and no physical Home Button During the company’s quarterly earnings call this week, Mr Cook fuelled speculation about Apple’s product roadmap for the next year. “I think the smartphone is still in the early innings of the game,” the 56-year-old Apple CEO told investors during the earnings call. “I think there’s lots more to do. Every year, I think it becomes more important to people’s lives, there’s more things people are doing with it.” Now a stunning concept has appeared on the web giving fans a glimpse of exactly how this new smartphone could look. Designer Gabor Balough has produced a set images that show just what Apple could be planning. GABOR BALOUGHThe iPhone 8 could use augmented reality to guide people around cities GABOR BALOUGH With a display that covers the entire front of the phone users would get more space for apps and notifications. Then there’s also the idea of augmented reality. Apple is thought to be planning something big with this technology and Gabor’s renders show how the camera and Siri could be used to help get directions and discover what’s around you. A simple question such as, “Hey Siri, what’s that tower?", when the camera is pointed towards a landmark could reveal the answer. Gabor is keen to point out that these pictures are simply a concept and may never appear on the real iPhone 8. But with rumours suggesting a new design with a curved display and home button embedded under the screen, he might not be too far away from how it’s really going to look. GABOR BALOUGHThe iPhone 8 is expected to feature a stunning curved AMOLED display Although the iPhone 8 clearly appears to be something special it may come with an expensive problem. Last month, a source told Fast Company the Apple iPhone 8 would ship with an eye-watering $1,000 price tag for the entry-level model, that's about £802 converted. That price point would not only make it the most expensive iPhone to date – it would also make the iPhone 8 much more expensive than its Samsung Galaxy S8 rival. If recent leaked pricing is correct, and the Samsung Galaxy S8 starts at £690 – it will be almost £110 cheaper than the entry-level iPhone 8. And with a very similar feature-set and industrial design, it remains to be seen whether customers are happy to cough-up the extra for Apple's iOS operating system and hardware design.

Bang is expected to become the nation's sixth-richest man in May when the firm will be listed on the KOSPI bourse. / Courtesy of Netmarble IPO to catapult high school dropout to one of wealthiest businessmen By Lee Min-hyung Netmarble founding CEO Bang Jun-hyuk is joining the ranks of the world's most successful dropouts, following in the footsteps of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs and Samsung Group founder Lee Byung-chul. The 50-year-old entrepreneur, also a high school dropout, is enjoying his heyday with the game titan set to make a successful KOSPI debut this May. This would allow him to become the nation's third-richest magnet in the tech industry after Samsung Group Chairman Lee Kun-hee and his son and group heir Lee Jae-yong. Netmarble submitted documents to the Korea Exchange last week for its planned initial public offering (IPO) with a target share price between 121,000 won ($108) and 157,000 won. This will let the firm mark up to 13.3 trillion won in market capitalization, the largest in the nation's game industry. After the IPO, Bang's stake would be amount to 24.47 percent and that is valuable enough to make him the nation's sixth-richest entrepreneur. His life story comes with a striking difference compared to other tycoons here, as he did not pile up his wealth by inheriting family-owned businesses from his parents. The country's five richest people gained their wealth thanks to their fathers instead of initiating their own businesses ― they are Lee Kun-hee, AmorePacific Chairman Suh Kyung-bae, Lee Jae-yong, Hyundai Motor Chairman Chung Mong-koo and SK Group Chairman Chey Tae-won. Excluding the so-called chaebol tycoons, Bang would be Korea's richest man in May. Plus, he has accomplished this outstanding success out of nothing. "As an elementary student, I used to deliver newspaper to raise money to study," he said in a company seminar held March last year. "It does not matter what background you come from," he said. "It is a pity that young people underestimate themselves and give up after making little effort. Everything depends on you." He said he decided to drop out of high school, as he thought it's stupid to study just to get better test scores. "When learning history, I wanted to study what our ancestors' actual life and culture looked like, rather than simply memorizing the years when historical events took place," he said. Before founding the company in 2000, Bang established two internet-based firms ― an online movie theater, and a satellite internet content business ― which ended up falling apart. But as the internet started to gain traction in Korea, his third company, Netmarble, brought massive success. He established the company with capital of only 100 million won and eight employees, identifying the infinite growth potential of online games. Aside from the notable success, his life has been in the center of the spotlight, as he was often compared to Steve Jobs here in that both left their founding companies and made a successful comeback to revive them. In 2006, Bang decided to step down from the management and leave the company due to his worsening health. Largely because of the leadership vacuum, Netmarble started to lose upward momentum, facing a series of turmoil in the wake of continuous failures of the firm's titles. Suffering from a five-year downturn, Bang decided to return in 2011 to stop the firm's weakening profitability and revive its gloomy business outlook. When he returned to the company, its last 19 titles had failed to attract attention and hardly generated any revenue. At that time, Netmarble posted billions of won in annual deficits. But Bang viewed the firm's future as "still promising," as the gaming industry at the time was in a state of transition with the rise of smartphones. His pioneering vision, to identify mobile games as a next growth area, has since paid off, with the company accomplishing outstanding growth, generating 1 trillion won in sales since 2015. Successful dropouts Bang and Jobs have one more thing in common ― both dropped out of school. In fact, there are many dropouts who became famous businessmen on top of Bang and Jobs such as Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and Japanese legendary entrepreneur and Panasonic founder Konosuke Matsushita. Samsung founder Lee Byung-chul, father of Chairman Lee Kun-hee, would be the most dramatic case because he dropped out four times in his life ― three times in Korea and once in Japan. He had neither a degree nor even a graduation certificate from an elementary school. It is touted as a mystery how he entered Waseda University, one of Japan's most prestigious ivory towers, in 1929 without a high school graduation certificate. He founded Samsung in 1937 and it is now one of the world's largest companies with affiliates such as Samsung Electronics, the global leader in smartphones and memory chips. mhlee@ktimes.comMore articles by this reporter Prosecution seeks arrest warrant for Park Geun-hye Unidentified bones, shoes found in Sewol [Provincial News] Yangsan city wrestles with illegally littered trash by foreigners Elementary school punishes boy for asking classmate to show her genitals [K-Terminology] Tired workers turn to 'sibal expense' for satisfaction Taejon Christian International School falls prey to $5.5 million scam 1,000 reporters apply to cover Sewol's last voyage Moon Jae-in wins first primary in landslide Adidas, Philip Morris pay 'excessive' royalties [Job News] Seoul startup center invites foreign firms Hazy Seoul No sale to Chinese Fine dust blanket Random candidacy Ostensible friends Worries over Taegeukgi Surprise!

The next iOS update won’t be iOS 11. Instead, it’ll be a new version of iOS 10 that delivers a host of new features including support for Apple’s new Clips application and a new “Rent once, watch anywhere” feature in iTunes. The iOS 10.3 release date is only a few short days away and now would be a good time to start getting familiar with the next version of iOS. Today we’re looking past the iOS 10.3 update at another version of iOS, one that will likely replace iOS 10 later this year. Apple isn’t talking about its iOS 11 update just yet but that should change in a few short weeks. 10 weeks to be exact. As we’ve started to push closer to the summer we’ve started to get more iOS 11 questions from friends, family and readers. They want to know when iOS 11 is coming out and what they can expect from Apple when its released. While some of these questions can be difficult to answer in March, there are a few basics we can provide you with. Here are a few things you can count on when it comes to Apple and the iOS 11 release for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. Exclusive iOS 11 Features Count on some exclusive iOS 11 features for the new iPhone and for newer versions of the iPhone, iPad, and iPod. iPhone 7 Plus Portrait Mode. You can count on an exclusive feature or two for the iPhone 7s/iPhone 8. The iPhone 7 Plus features a Portrait mode, also known as Bokeh mode, that isn’t available on any other iOS devices. The iPhone 7 also features an updated Taptic Engine that provides feedback when you interact with certain parts of iOS 10. When the Notification Center drops, you’ll feel a thud. The iPhone 6s and iPhone 6 Plus version of iOS arrived with the ability to shoot Live Photos. Live Photos move when pressed thanks to 3D Touch. Most of the time, these features are exclusive because a device doesn’t possess the necessary hardware. For instance, the iPhone 6 and iPhone 5s don’t feature 3D Touch. Here are a few other examples: The iPhone 5 iOS 10 update also failed to bring burst photo mode, slow-motion video mode, and voicemail transcription. The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus iOS 10 updates didn’t come with the Raise to Wake featured on the iPhone SE, iPhone 6s and iPhone 7. Nothing is confirmed but we’re already hearing about some of the iOS 11 features that could help Apple sell the iPhone 7s/iPhone 8. The company is reportedly planning substantial upgrades to Siri, iOS’ personal assistant. There’s also chatter about improved Haptic feedback. The specifics don’t matter at this point. What it boils down to is this. If you own or are planning to buy a newer version of the iPhone, iPad or iPod touch, your iOS 11 update will be more robust than your friend with an older piece of hardware. Look for the first iOS 11 features to be confirmed in June at WWDC 2017. iOS 11 Beta You can count on an iOS 11 beta release ahead of the official iOS 11 release date. The WWDC 2017 developer conference is slated to kickoff on June 5th in San Jose, California. There, Apple will almost certainly deliver a keynote to its developers and viewers around the world. And it’s during that keynote where we’ll likely see Apple confirm the early version of iOS 11. If you’re looking to try iOS 11 early, you’ll want to circle June 5th on the calendar. We expect iOS 11 beta to be released shortly after the keynote. Apple will almost certainly release two versions of the iOS 11 beta: One for developers and one for the free Beta Software Program. Best case scenario is Apple releases both on the same day. Worst case scenario is Apple waits a few weeks before releasing the free version of the iOS 11 beta. Developers must pay an annual $99 fee to become a developer and gain access to the beta. Missing Devices You can count on some devices being left behind on iOS 10. Last year, it was iPhone 4s, iPad 2, iPad 3, iPad mini, and iPod touch 5th-gen users who were left behind on iOS 9.3.5. This year, we expect at least two devices to be held back on iOS 10. Nothing is confirmed but we’re confident that Apple will keep the iPhone 5 and the (recently discontinued) iPad mini 2 on iOS 10. We could see a few others join the list but if you own an iPhone 5 or iPad mini 2 or both, start tempering your expectations. We’ll probably find out for sure in early June when Apple releases the first version of the iOS 11 beta. iOS 11 Release Date Unless Apple goes without a beta, and we suspect that it won’t, you can count on an official iOS 11 release in the fall alongside the company’s new iPhone. Thus far, iPhone 7s/iPhone 8 release date rumors point to another release in and around the month of September. This has been standard practice for several years now and there’s no reason to believe Apple will stray from protocol. Apple iPhone/iOS release protocol calls for a fall media event where the company confirms the new iPhone and an iOS release date. Typically, the company releases new iOS software for older devices a few days ahead of the new iPhone release date. Look for the iOS 11 beta to stretch over several months with a final iOS 11 release date in September. New Emojis & 64-Bit At this point, in our eyes, there are two things you can count on in terms of iOS 11 features. The first is the death of 32-bit emulation. iOS 10.3 beta testers have discovered a warning message when trying to run 32-bit applications. The message in iOS 10.3 says these apps “will not work with future versions of iOS” and that the developer will need to release an update for them to continue running properly. The apps work fine on iOS 10.3 which has led many people to believe iOS 11 will usher in a new era. Shocked Face with Exploding Head is a candidate for Unicode 10. We also expect the iOS 11 update to deliver Unicode 10 emojis. Unicode 10 is scheduled to be released in mid-2017 which means iOS 11 should be the update that brings us Grinning Face With Star Eyes, Merperson, Curling Stone, T-Rex, Orange Heart, and Person in Steamy Room, and many more emojis, should they make the cut. If we use iOS 10  and Unicode 9.0 as a guide, look for an iOS 11.x update to bring these emojis to your iPhone and iPad. iOS 10.2 delivered Unicode 9.0 emojis to iPhone and iPad in December. iOS 10.3 Update: 9 Reasons to Get Excited & 3 Reasons Not To iOS 10.3 Release Date Narrows   1 / 12 The first thing to get excited about is that you won't have to wait too much longer for iOS 10.3 to arrive for your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch. If you're uninterested in trying out the iOS 10.3 beta, or if you're dealing with an maddening problem on iOS 10.2.1 on an older version of iOS, you should know that the iOS 10.3 release date should land in the near future. We haven't been able to nail down an exact date but we now know it'll be out before the end of April. Apple's announced a new Clips application (more on that later) that it's planning to release sometime during the month of April. How does the iOS 10.3 release play into this? Well, iOS 10.3 is required to use the Clips app.  iOS 10.3 is also required to use one of the new features on board iTunes 12.6.  iTunes 12.6 features a "Rent once, watch anywhere" that allows iTunes users to watch their movie rentals across all devices. This feature requires iOS 10.3 to operate, a sign that we're really, really close to a release. If not March, we'll probably see it touch down sometime in early April.    1 / 12 Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published. Comment Name* Email* Website
