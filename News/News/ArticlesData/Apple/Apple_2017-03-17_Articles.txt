 2 ways to analyze an income statement John Szramiak, Vintage Value Investing Mar. 19, 2017, 1:02 PM 3,503 facebook linkedin twitter email print Flickr via logatfer As an investor, you should be digging in to a company’s financial statements. However, you can’t look at these financials in isolation – it’s important to compare a company’s results to other companies in the selected industry, companies outside of the industry, and against other years to determine whether or not that company might actually be an attractive investment. This causes difficulties, since it’s hard to compare companies of different sizes. For example, if Company A has $3,000,000 of debt outstanding and Company B has $30,000,000 of debt outstanding, is Company A less risky than Company B? We have no way of knowing, because we don’t know the cash positions of Companies A and B, how profitable Companies A and B are, etc. Fortunately, there are two forms of analysis that we can perform that will help us look at income statements and balance sheets of different sizes, so that we can compare apples-to-apples – they are: horizontal analysis and vertical analysis. Both are very easy to understand. Let’s start with horizontal analysis. WHAT IS HORIZONTAL ANALYSIS? Horizontal analysis, also called time series analysis, focuses on trends and changes in numbers over time. Horizontal allows you to detect growth patterns, cyclicality, etc. and to compare these factors among different companies. As an example, let’s take a look at some income statement items for Apple and Google. Vintage Value Investing It’s almost impossible to tell which is growing faster by just looking at the numbers. So we have to do some calculations. We can perform horizontal analysis on the income statement by simply taking the percentage change for each line item year-over-year.  Vintage value Investing By using horizontal analysis, we can now clearly see that Google’s revenue, gross profit, and EBITDA grew faster than Apple’s in every year except for 2015. We can even take this one step further by calculating the compound annual growth rate for each line item from 2012 to 2016 (you can do this in Excel by using the function: =rate(nper, pmt, pv, fv)) – this tells us the average rate the companies grew in each year. Vintage Value Investing Our horizontal analysis (time series analysis) is now officially complete. WHAT IS VERTICAL ANALYSIS? Vertical analysis, also called common-size analysis, focuses on the relative size of different line items so that you can easily compare the income statements and balance sheets of different sized companies. Let’s go back to our income statement items for Apple and Google. Through our horizontal analysis, we know that Google has been growing at a faster and more sustained rate than Apple… but is it a relatively more profitable company? Do both companies profits seem to be sustainable? To perform vertical analysis (common-size analysis), we take each line item and calculate it as a percentage of revenue so that we can come up with “common size” results for both companies. Here are just the numbers once again. I’ve added a line for research & development costs as well. Vintage Value Investing Now, let’s divide each line item by revenue. Vintage Value Investing So what does this tell us? For starters, in 2016, Apple generated $0.39 for every $1 dollar in sales it made. Google did much better, generated $0.61 for every $1 in sales it made. However, Google’s other costs (such as sales, marketing, general & administrative, and R&D) are much higher, since Google’s EBITDA margin was 33.7%, compared to Apple’s 34.0%. We can also look at trends within this vertical analysis. For example, Apple’s gross profit has declined from 43.9% in 2012 to 39.1%, while its R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue have increased from 2.2% to 4.7% over the same time period. This could suggest that Apple is facing tough competitive pressures. Why? Trends in gross margin generally reveal how much pricing power a company has. Because Apple’s gross margin is declining, this probably means that (a) Apple is dropping the price of its products to match lower cost competitors, (b) Apple’s costs to produce its products are increasing and Apple is unable to increase prices to offset this, or (c) a combination of both. This increase in R&D suggests that Apple is doubling down its efforts to create new, innovative products to offset its competition. HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL ANALYSIS OF THE BALANCE SHEET Just like we performed horizontal and vertical analysis on the income statement, we can also run these calculations on the balance sheet (when performing vertical analysis of the balance sheet, line items are usually taken as a percentage of total assets). The process to calculate these ratios is similar to the examples we went through above and are fairly straight forward. However, I’ve found that horizontal and vertical analysis of the balance sheet is much less helpful than on the income statement (ratios and YoY growth rates are basically requirements when analyzing any income statement) and can often be distorted by accounting policies (for example, is a debt-to-equity ratio really useful if the equity number used is simply a result of various accounting choices made over the years?). Rather than calculate a “pure ratio” of the balance sheet, we can instead calculate “mixed ratios” – such as an interest coverage ratio (operating income / interest expense), leverage ratio (debt / EBITDA), or even efficiency ratios like days sales outstanding (DSO) and days payable outstanding (DPO).

Some would conclude that Apple Music was not resonating with Apple's customers; but Daryanani calls streaming a "very unpenetrated" sector in relation to the installed user base, and a "very attractive opportunity" for growth. Even at its current levels Apple Music is contributing 12% of the revenue pouring into Apple's Services division (the App Stores, iTunes and Apple Music, AppleCare and Apple Upgrade Program, Licensing, and the Genius Bar). iTunes is still contributing 22% But Apple Music contribution to the bottom line looks less rosy when considering the low gross margins that it delivers.

Being a cord cutter (actually, I've never had cable, so I haven't technically cut any cords), I'm always on the hunt for new ways to keep myself entertained. On Apple TV, I use a handful of apps that, either I subscribe to a streaming service for (like Hulu and Netflix), or offer a free streaming TV feature that doesn't require a cable subscription (like PBS and The CW). There is also this thing called broadcast television, which anyone can watch as long as they have a TV that supports digital television (or a digital conversion box) and an over-the-air (OTA) HDTV antenna. The thing about broadcast television is that I can't watch it on Apple TV. I have to switch my TV input over, and then I can flip through the channels until I find something to watch. I rarely watch broadcast television because I tend to stick with Apple TV for my TV and movie watching activities. That is until I got HDHomeRun. With HDHomeRun, not only can I watch live broadcast television on my Apple TV, I can also watch it on my iPhone or iPad. Plus, with the right app, I'm able to record live TV and watch it the way a person with cable and a DVR would watch TV. Skip those commercials! I'm going to explain a little bit more about what HDHomeRun is and how to set it up. What is HDHomeRun? It's a box, about the size of an Apple TV, maybe a little smaller, that acts as a transmitter. When connecting it to your internet router and your OTA antenna, it makes it possible for you to watch live TV on any other device that is also using the same internet connection. Here's how it works: You connect an ethernet cable to your home's internet modem. Then, you connect your OTA antenna to it (the antenna does not need to be connected to your TV set). Then, you plug it into a power source. Then, using a computer, you scan for local channels, just like you do when setting up broadcast television on your TV set. Then, you watch TV. HDHomeRun doesn't have an official app for iOS or tvOS, but you can start watching TV on your computer right away when you download the official HDHomeRun app on your Mac. If you want to get broadcast television on your iPhone, iPad, or Apple TV, you'll have to download a third-party app. I highly recommend Channels. With the app installed on your other devices, all you have to do is open the app, scan for your HDHomeRun, and start watching live TV. Why would I want HDHomeRun First off, you're probably only going to be interested in using HDHomeRun if you are a cord cutter (if you don't have a cable subscription). There is an HDHomeRun box specifically for people that have a cable subscription, but, other than not having to rent multiple cable boxes, I'm not sure this setup would benefit a subscriber, since there are plenty of apps that make watching broadcast television easy, as long as you have cable. You might be asking, "How is this any different from simply watching CBS, NBC, or ABC on my TV?" Because that's what I asked, at first. Actually, there are two main benefits to using HDHomeRun as a broadcast television channel transmitter. The obvious benefit is that you can watch broadcast television on any supported device in your house, including computers, smartphones, tablets, Xbox One, set-top boxes (like Amazon Fire TV and Apple TV), and other media centers that support such apps as Plex, Emby, and Kodi. You don't just have to watch TV on your TV. You can watch it anywhere. A second benefit is that, with the right app, you can record live TV and watch it when you want, even when you don't have an internet connection. Even app channels for Apple TV don't offer that — cable subscription or not. If you're the type of person that would only watch broadcast television on your TV set and don't care about being able to record shows to watch later, HDHomeRun is not the set up for you. If, however, you like the idea of watching your local news on your iPhone, iPad, or Apple TV, or you want to be able to record live TV and watch it at your leisure without needing a cable subscription to do so, you should think about investing in HDHomeRun. What do I need in order to watch free live TV on my Apple TV, iPhone, or iPad? Most importantly, you'll need to be living in a country that supports digital TV that receives either ATSC, DVB-T and DVB-T2, DVB-C or QAM. You'll also need the HDHomerun box. HDHomeRun Connect - $109 - Probably the box you want. It works with 802.11ac (for HD playback) or 802.11n (for SD playback) wireless internet connectivity and lets you stream live TV to two devices at the same time. HDHomeRun Extend - $179 - The same as the Connect, but with video transcoding. If you have a poor internet connection in your area, this is the model you should get. The Extend compresses videos in real time so you aren't maxing out your bandwidth. HDHomeRun Prime - $115 - This is the box that is only for cable subscribers. It requires a digital cable subscription and a CableCard, which you can rent from your provider. If you don't already have one, you'll need an over-the-air HDTV antenna with a coax connector that is able to work as a receiver in your area. Depending on how far away you are from your local channel broadcast center, you might only need an indoor antenna, which you can get for about $15 - $30, or you might need an attic or outdoor mounted antenna, which could cost as much as $150. You can figure out which type of antenna you'll need by using TV Fool's signal locator. If you're on the Apple ecosystem, you'll also need a third-party app that works with HDHomeRun. There are a variety of software options that range in price from a few dollars up front, to a monthly subscription. It all depends on what you want or need. The best app for watching live TV on Apple TV is Channels for Apple TV, which costs $24.99. The iPhone and iPad version costs $14.99 (and you do have to buy them separately). It has a few extra features — it records up to 30 minutes of a channel you're watching so you can pause it and come back later (great for skipping commercials). You can also use Plex with your Plex Pass subscription, Emby with your Emby Premier subscription, or Kodi if you side load it to Apple TV. These apps are great for DVR recording, but require a little bit of set up and a subscription for the former two. If you don't already use Plex, Emby, or Kodi, you may want to stick with Channels. If you do plan on recording full episodes of shows or movies, you'll also need a hard drive with 6-8 GB of disk space per hour of recording. So, you might need to invest in a 1, 2, or 3 TB external hard drive to store your shows, which range in price from $25 - $130, depending on how much live TV you want to record and watch later. How do I set up HDHomRun? It's easier than you think, but SiliconDust, the company that makes HDHomeRun didn't do a very good job of explaining how to set it up. The simple instructions are actually a tad bit too simple. Here's a little more detail on what you'll need to do. The first thing you should do is suss out where you're going to set up the HDHomeRun. The box needs to be connected to your modem, the antenna, and a power source at all times, though none of it needs to be connected to your television set or computer. Be sure you've got a good location to set everything up. The next thing you should do is disconnect your OTA HDTV antenna from your TV set if you haven't already. It doesn't need to be connected to it anymore It doesn't even have to be in the same room as your TV set. Instead, connect your antenna to the HDHomeRun box using the coax cable. Next, connect the HDHomeRun box to your home modem or router using the included ethernet cable. Just plug one end of the ethernet cable into the box, and the other end into the ethernet port on the modem or router. The HDHomeRun will always need to stay connected to the modem or router, so make sure you've got room nearby to set up the box and antenna. You could also invest in a longer ethernet cable if you need to. Then, plug the box into a power source. Any old wall plug will do. After you see a solid green light on the HDHomeRun box (just below the ethernet port), go to myhdhomerun.com to scan for channels in order to prepare to watch live TV. Last, download the necessary software. You can download a compatible app for your Mac right from myhdhomerun.com. You can also download the Channels app for iPhone and iPad (my personal recommendation) or InstaTV Pro. On Apple TV, you can use Plex with your Plex Pass subscription or Emby with an Emby Premier subscription, or you could also side load Kodi and use the HDHomeRun add-on. If you don't already use Plex, Emby, or Kodi on your Apple TV, you should probably get Channels for Apple TV (my recommendation) or InstaTV Pro. Once you open one of the apps, the channels should automatically populate for your viewing pleasure. If you don't see your channels, you can rescan from within the app and you should see them after that. Any questions? Do you have any questions about what HDHomeRun is, how it works, or how to set it up? Put them in the comments and we'll help you out. Reader comments How to watch live TV on your Apple TV without cable 20 Comments View All Comments Log In to Comment Register Sort by Date Sort by Rating Pontavignon Lory Nice article. I have been using the setup you describe (Apple TV/HDHomeRun/Connect software) for about a year and it is a cord-abstainer's delight. Some advantages you don't mention: 1. You no longer need multiple remotes. The one that comes with the Apple 4 TV does everything. 2. If your house has Apple TVs 2 and 3 that you are not replacing right yet, Airplay can stream live TV to them from any of your iDevices. 3. I have one ceiling-mounted TV that rotates to serve the dining or living rooms. With the OTA TV going through the Apple TV, I can send the sound to either of the separate sound systems that serve each room. I have found the system so useful that I got a second HDHomeRun so the OTA Channels (17 on a good day) can serve four devices at a time. Can't recommend the setup enough. Sent from the iMore App 0 4 days ago Reply Lory Gil Thanks for your insight. It's great to see the many ways you've used HDHomeRun! 0 4 days ago Reply jfergus11 Question for you: I'm considering getting another HDHomeRun (Extend) myself, because I need a 2nd antenna to pick up a station in another direction. Does the Channels app require you to pick a tuner to run from, or does it automatically determine the best / most available one to use? 0 4 days ago Reply Pontavignon I can't help because I use a single antenna split to the 2 HDHomeRuns, so they are providing four undifferentiated streams. Maybe Lory can be more helpful, or perhaps the manufacturers are the best source. 0 4 days ago Reply Lory Gil The Channels app will scan for channels that the HDHomeRun is transmitting. There doesn't appear to be an option to use multiple transmitters for the purpose of scanning for different channels. Are you sure you need two separate antennas? It might make your life a lot easier to just get one new antenna that has multi-directional support. It may be more expensive, but would probably save you time and heartache trying to deal with two separate antennas. 0 3 days ago Reply Bbenb I too have two antennas and two HDHomeruns. With Channels you can select which channel from each tuner. In my case the backside of one antennas is stronger than the antenna pointing at the tower. If you want to record you need something to record to, I use my MacMin you could have more storage by using a NAS. I use the app "SignalGH to check signal strength and quality. 0 3 days ago Reply FercKast You'd be better off going with Sling than with HDHomeRun since you wouldn't need an extraneous device laying around, gathering dust, just to access their app. 0 4 days ago Reply Lory Gil Sling TV costs at least $20 per month. HDHomeRun doesn't charge a subscription price for watching free broadcast television. They are different products. I think Sling provides a great service, but HDHomeRun is geared more toward people that don't want to pay a monthly subscription price to watch television. 0 4 days ago Reply Bbenb Channels charges $8/month if you want their DVR version. I'm in between two major markets, it's nice to pick which market to watch. I don't think Slng or any other service will give you that option. 0 3 days ago Reply jfergus11 Hi Lori, Just for clarification: the transcoding of the more expensive "HDHomeRun Extend" model simply means you can get away with streaming HD on a home 802.11n WiFi network, instead of the 802.11ac WiFi required by the cheaper HDHomeRun. It doesn't really have anything to do with one's Internet connection, since all the traffic is within one's home WiFi network. 0 4 days ago Reply Lory Gil This information is from Silicon Dust: "If you are using legacy wifi, or have multiple televisions spread out over a large house, we recommend the EXTEND to reduce the bandwidth required between your media devices and your HDHomeRun." "If you are using a wired network or a latest-generation wireless network over a short distance, we recommend the cheaper CONNECT." 0 3 days ago Reply pereiragd I would also add the revised HDHomeRun Extend has a mostly metal black case that looks better and is better at dissipating heat. In addition, the transcoding of the video makes more efficient use of your network and will be less affected by WiFi network congestion. For example, if you live in a city or can see many other WiFi networks in your home, the Extend will perform better on your computer, tablet, smartphone, etc. 0 1 day ago Reply taylorh How does Homerun compare to Tabo? I guess Tablo doesn't supoort aappleTV? Otherwise it sounds like a similar product. I use Roku 95% of the time anyway. Thanks 0 4 days ago Reply Lory Gil Actually, Tablo does support Apple TV now. I haven't tried it yet, but it looks like it's very similar, but about twice the price. Tablo's most noticeable difference is that there is a four-tuner model available, which means you can watch OTA TV on four different devices at the same time. 0 3 days ago Reply steviet02 The bigger thing with the multiple tuners is that you will be able to record on all 4 channels. Depending on your setup this may be a bigger feature than 4 separate viewers at the same time. If you have 4 watching at the same time, you will need multiple devices to be able to record and view at the same time, otherwise I could see that being an annoying ongoing issue. 0 1 day ago Reply OgOgilby Lori, but you limit your readers to this device. There is a similar device that I have been using for years now called "Simple TV". It has worked flawlessly and I can view and record all OTA channels on all my devices. Even your buddy on TWIT TV never mentions it, is there some reason for that. 0 3 days ago Reply taylorh I hadn't even heard of Simple TV. I'd heard of Tablo and Home Run, but not Simple TV. I'm leaning toward Tablo as it has a 4-tuner model that sounds appealing. Otherwise I have to take into account subscription (guide data) fees and other limitations. 0 3 days ago Reply Lory Gil Simple TV looks like it's close to the same as HDHomeRun, but costs quite a bit more ($200 for the base model). It does, however, look like it has an official Apple app with DVR recording included, which is something HDHomeRun doesn't have. 0 3 days ago Reply steviet02 You can't even buy the tuners/streamers anymore. Maybe thats why no one is mentioning it? 0 20 hours ago Reply BongBongOnTwitter Would be great if someone made a standalone tuner and streamer that could capture HDTV signals and send them over wifi to ones iPad. Theoretically, such a concept should be able to work without any internet provider and no subscriptions involved whatsoever. 0 3 days ago Reply 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2016 Mobile Nations • Terms and Conditions • Privacy Policy • Careers: Writer | Dev • Licensing • External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner

Login here or sign up here Tech Smartphones have an unexpected new rival New generation of feature phones looking like a threat to Apple and its rivals. Adam Minter, Bloomberg View  /  18 March 2017&nbsp12:42 Last week, an Indian government official announced that iPhones will start rolling off an assembly line in Bangalore by the end of April, targeted at local customers. It’s a big moment for Apple, which is counting on India’s emerging middle class to make up for slowing sales in other markets. But don’t bet on the iPhone conquering India, or any other emerging market, just yet. That’s because smartphones of all kinds are facing stiff competition from an unlikely new challenger: feature phones. With simple handsets and small screens intended mostly for calls and text messages — similar to the Nokia or Motorola you probably owned years ago — a new generation of feature phones is suddenly looking like a threat to Apple and its rivals. For a technology long ago left for dead, feature phones have lately made some impressive gains. After years of almost continuous decline, global shipments have grown for two consecutive quarters. Growth in emerging markets has been especially impressive: In Africa, feature-phone shipments surged 32 percent year-over-year in the second quarter of 2016, compared to a decline of 5.2 percent for smartphones. Expect that trend to continue, for a few reasons. One obvious advantage is price. At the end of 2016, the average global price of a smartphone was $256, compared to $19.30 for a feature phone. In emerging markets, where even educated urbanites typically earn less than $10,000 a year (in India, they average $5,385), that doesn’t leave much in the way of consumer choice. But even if a buyer has $256 to spare, the booming secondhand market offers far better options than a smartphone. In Ghana, where I recently spent a few weeks, $256 will buy a used Pentium III desktop computer, a flat-screen monitor, a satellite dish and a decoder box to pirate satellite television broadcasts. Another factor is battery life. In many emerging markets, where electricity service can be intermittent, smartphones that have to be recharged each day can’t compete against feature phones that can now go for weeks on a single charge. In West Africa, it’s the rare smartphone owner who doesn’t also carry a feature phone as a hedge against missing calls and messages due to battery depletion. Equally important, most emerging-market customers prepay for voice and data, making smartphones that passively eat up bandwidth a major inconvenience.  Feature-phone makers are also coming up with innovative hardware and services. Chinese-owned iTel has introduced a speech-to-text system that might appeal to hundreds of millions of illiterate or visually impaired buyers with low incomes. India’s Zync just introduced six new feature phones with multiple SIM card slots, so customers can take advantage of lower rates when calling phones on the same carrier, or use separate lines for personal and business matters. Reliance Jio Infocomm is said to have a feature phone in the works that enables free calls over LTE networks, much as Skype does, for less than $20. The most important innovation, though, has been the development of mobile-payment systems that require nothing more than text-messaging. A user simply buys credit at a bank or service center, then transfers the money via text to friends or merchants. For the roughly 2 billion people around the world who lack access to basic financial services, that can be a life-changing service. Kenya’s M-Pesa, which enables money transfers via SMS, has about 19 million users who exchange more than $140 million daily. In India, the government is fast-tracking such services as a remedy to its demonetization crisis. For smartphone makers, all this spells trouble. Some analysts in India are predicting a slump in smartphone sales and upgrades this year. Leading feature-phone brands have even started introducing cheap smartphones of their own, hoping to convert their considerable market share and brand recognition into upgrades. It’s likely that the next major advance in mobile technology won’t be dictated by designers in Silicon Valley or Seoul — but rather by the needs of emerging-market consumers. In that sense, at least, old-school feature phones are starting to look very much like the future.

The biggest rivalry in the smartphone world used to be the one between Samsung and Apple, but now Google has joined in the race. We think it’s safe to say that Apple’s iPhone 7 is in a league of its own because it runs on iOS, but Samsung’s Galaxy S7 and Google’s Pixel are competing against each other on a daily basis. Customers never know which one deserves their money the most, but today we’re going to try and clear that up by pining Galaxy S7 and Pixel against each other in order to see how well the fare. This brief comparison will be focused on the hardware power these two flagships are offering. Samsung Galaxy S7 vs Google Pixel: Hardware Performance The South Korean tech manufacturer knows that hardware power is very important and that’s why it decided to equip the smartphone with its own octa-core Exynos 8890 chipset. The processor features four cores that clock at 2.3GHz Mongoose and other four ones that have been clocked at 1.6GHz Cortex-A53. Even better, Samsung has coupled the processor with a Mali-T880 MP 12 graphics processing unit and 4GB of RAM. On the other hand we have Pixel, the smartphone is believed to represent Google’s vision of a perfect Android powered smartphone. Now let’s pop up its hood and see what’s fueling Pixel. Unlike Samsung, Google decided to go with one of Qualcomm’s quad-core Snapdragon 821 chipsets. The processor is actually faster than Galaxy S7’s chipset because it has two cores that clock at 2.15GHz Kyro and other two ones that feature a base clock speed of 1.6GHz Kyro. Google decided to spice things up and paired Pixel’s processor with an Adreno 530 graphics processing unit and 4GB of RAM. Samsung Galaxy S7 vs Google Pixel: Verdict After closely inspecting their hardware performance, we can see why these two smartphones fit into the same category. Although many consider them as equals, Pixel has the upper hand. Google has made a wise decision when it chose to collaborate with Qualcomm since its Snapdragon 821 processor is slightly faster than Galaxy S7’s Exynos 8890 chipset.

The world's greatest investor placed a big bet on the future of the iPhone maker. Here's why Warren Buffett likes Apple. John Ballard (TMFRazorback) Mar 18, 2017 at 5:02PM CEO Warren Buffett recently disclosed that Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) owned 133 million shares, or about $18.5 billion, worth of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock. Apple joins other sizable holdings -- Wells Fargo & Co and The Coca-Cola Co -- as one of Berkshire Hathaway's top equity investments. Throughout his career, Warren Buffett has made successful investments in several different industries, but some of his most famous and rewarding investments have been in consumer product companies. His 1988 investment in Coca-Cola is probably Buffett's most famous investment. Similar to Apple, Coca-Cola had a product with universal appeal and was demonstrating growing revenue and profits at the time when Warren Buffett invested 25% of Berkshire Hathaway's book value in Coke shares. Apple's competitive advantage Apple's Opera retail store in Paris. IMAGE SOURCE: APPLE INC.  Although the Apple investment is notable because of Buffett's historical tendency to shun tech stocks, it actually fits the qualities the Omaha-based investor has looked for in other investments. If you use an iPhone, iPad, and/or a Mac computer, you probably have some experience with the stickiness of Apple's products and services. It's not likely that someone who has taken lots of photos of treasured moments and purchased lots of content from iTunes is suddenly going to abandon Apple for a Samsung Electronics Co or a Microsoft product. Millions of customers have a strong attachment with Apple's devices, and this is what attracted Warren Buffett's attention: Apple strikes me as having quite a sticky product and enormously useful product that people would use ... The continuity of the product is huge, and the degree to which their lives center around it is huge. And it's a pretty nice ... franchise to have with a consumer product. Apple creates beautifully designed products and has successfully tied it all together with Apple's iCloud storage service, which automatically keeps all of your content synced between devices. The unique, spartan-esque product design and sticky services have led Apple to become one of the most iconic brands in the world. Apple consistently earns high customer satisfaction ratings, which continues to help sell tens of millions of iPhones every quarter. This success has been a good marketing tool for other product lines like Mac computers, which continues to show strength while the PC industry is in decline. These qualities have led to impressive growth in Apple's business over the last 10 years: Fiscal Year Revenue Net Income 2016 $215.6  $45.7 2011 $108.2 $25.9 2007 $24.0 $3.5 Amounts in billions. DATA SOURCE: Apple Inc. annual reports.   While Samsung controls the No. 1 spot in smartphone market share in terms of unit sales, Apple generated every dollar of profit in the industry in 2016, according to one analyst. Apple achieves this by commanding a premium price to competing products, reinforcing the brand's strength in the marketplace. Should you follow Warren Buffett and buy Apple? Let's not kid ourselves: Warren Buffett is one of the world's greatest investors. You could do a lot worse than just sit back and buy every stock Berkshire Hathaway owns, and never sell. But keep in mind that Warren Buffett's investments don't always perform well right off the bat. In 2011, he disclosed on CNBC that Berkshire Hathaway's $10.7 billion investment in International Business Machines, which has dramatically underperformed the market ever since. SPY data by YCharts. Don't expect to hit a homerun with Apple Nonetheless, the strong financial position of the company and a great brand should deliver decent returns for shareholders in the future, but don't expect to earn anything close to the stock's nearly 1,000% rise in the last 10 years. SPY data by YCharts. The stock trades for a very reasonable 16 times earnings, and analysts expect the company to grow about 9% annually over the next five years.  Apple also offers an annual dividend yield of 1.6%, and management has been using cash flow to buy back shares, helping earnings per share grow 16% annually over the last five years compared to 14.8% annual growth in revenue. Plenty more dividends and share buybacks will come since the business generates over $60 billion in annual cash flow and currently has a whopping $246 billion in cash assets on the balance sheet and only $73.5 billion in debt.  Investors can achieve success using their own insights My takeaway from Warren Buffett's investment in Apple is the advantage individual investors have over the big financial institutions in managing their own money. Anyone who has been an Apple customer in the last 10 years would have figured out long ago the same qualities one legendary investor observed only recently.

Digital Trends Home > Gaming > Indie Showcase: Apple to prominently feature indie… Indie Showcase: Apple to prominently feature indie games for the long haul By Steven Petite — March 16, 2017 3:09 PM Subscribe Share Subscribe on YouTube Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you Apple's dedication to promoting indie games could lead to the release of unique games that previously wouldn't have stood a chance on the App Store Apple is making it easier for independent games to get noticed by App Store users with its newly launched Indie Showcase. The curated section will receive consistent updates, and act as both a beacon for new and unique indie games, as well as best-of lists similar to Apple’s Editor’s Choice lists. All of the highlighted games will be hand-picked by the team that has spotlighted worthwhile games, both free and paid, since the App Store launched in 2008. Leading up to the official unveiling and launch of Indie Showcase, Apple spent the last two weeks promoting an eclectic batch of indie titles at discounted rates on both the home and games pages. Prominently featured titles included the critically acclaimed Device 6, Super Hexagon, and Mushroom 11, a well-received PC indie that came to iOS recently. More: ‘Mass Effect: Andromeda’ mobile app lets you manage your gear while on the go Speaking with Polygon, Mushroom 11 creator Itay Keren said, “By setting up this showcase and reserving this desired spot on their store, Apple is essentially taking a stand to insure the creativity, sustainability and diversity.” Placement on the App Store often has a direct correlation with the success of a game. The Indie Showcase initiative ensures that games from small studios are given a chance to thrive in a saturated market filled with free-to-play juggernauts like Clash Royale and titles from large developers like Nintendo’s Super Mario Run. As of publication, Surgeon Simulator, Botanicula, The Escapists, and Prune — four indie games — occupy spots in the top-10 paid chart across the entire App Store. It’s unclear at this time how often Apple will rotate games in and out of the showcase, but we know that it’s set to be a permanent and noticeable fixture with a myriad of categories to shine a light on a wide variety of titles. As of now, there’s categories for new indies, great sound design, gameplay, narrative, innovation, a deals section, and a top-25 list. Apple doesn’t let developers pay for preferential statement on the App Store, so the playing field has never necessarily been unfair, but the Indie Showcase is still a step in the right direction for everyone that’s interested in widening their game selections.

The latest items added and dropped from the basket of goods the Office for National Statistics uses to calculate inflation suggests changing tastes in both alcohol consumption and how we choose to stay fit and healthy. The “shopping baskets” of items used in compiling the various measures of consumer price inflation are reviewed each year. Some items are taken out of the baskets and some are brought in to make sure the measures are up to date and representative of consumer spending patterns. In 2017, 16 items have been added to the CPIH basket, 11 items have been removed and 8 have been modified. Read More Do you know how many calories are in your favourite gin? Gin replaces the more generic spirit based drink in the basket, as the ONS says expenditure on gin has risen and there has been an increase in the number of small distilleries over recent years. Among the items added this year is non-dairy milk, such as soya or almond, to represent the growing “Free From” market. Apple cider and flavoured ciders have also been added, reflecting growing popularity and diversity, with apple cider sold in pubs replaced with a broader cider to reflect wider availability of pear and other varieties. Gin and Tonic As more people take up cycling and sports such as triathlon, cycle helmets and men’s base layer tops have been added to the basket. For children, swings are out but scooters are in, while cough liquid, jigsaws for adults and half chocolate-coated biscuits are the other new items in the basket. Council tax and rates bills in Northern Ireland have been added to the basket for the first time. While they have previously been included in RPI, they are now also in the CPIH measure.

Mentholated cigarettes are out, in part because the EU Tobacco Products Directive 2014 will see distinguishable flavours including menthol banned from 2020. Brake parts and single drainer sinks go as these types of items are already well covered in the basket. Additions New Item Notes Half chocolate-coated biscuits New item. Introduced to expand the coverage of biscuits and cakes. Non-dairy milk drink New item. This has been introduced to represent the “Free From” food sector which is a distinct and growing market. The item covers milk-type drinks based on, for example, soya or almond. Flavoured water New item. Introduced as expenditure is rising and to widen the coverage in the Mineral waters, soft drinks and juices category. Gin, bottle Expenditure has risen and there has been an increase in the number of small distilleries over recent years. Gin replaces the spirit based drink item in the baskets. Apple cider, 4 can pack Together with the flavoured cider, canned apple cider replaces bottled cider reflecting the availability of the products in outlets. Flavoured cider, bottle This has been introduced due to an increase in expenditure and shelf space devoted to flavoured cider. The item could be apple or pear based but must be flavoured. Men’s base layer top New item. A type of clothing not currently covered but widely purchased. More broadly, garments is an under-covered area of the baskets. Cycle helmet New item. This has been introduced principally to improve and diversify the coverage in an underrepresented area of the baskets. It also reflects the growing popularity of cycling. Average council tax bills in Great Britain Already included in the RPI and now added to CPIH as it is a cost associated with owning, maintaining and living in one’s own home. Its inclusion follows an open consultation of users. Average rates bills in Northern Ireland Already included in the RPI and now added to CPIH as it is a cost associated with owning, maintaining and living in one’s own home. Its inclusion follows an open consultation of users. Cough liquid New item added to diversify the range of pharmacy products in the baskets and represent a specific product not previously covered. Child’s scooter Replaces the child’s swing for which the number of price quotes collected each month has been falling reflecting its availability in shops particularly in the winter months. Scooters will represent children’s outdoor play equipment throughout the year. Jigsaw New item. The jigsaw has been introduced to represent an adult- type hobby. This is an under-covered area of the baskets. Cider Replaces apple cider in order to additionally capture price movements for pear and flavoured ciders which have increased in popularity over recent years. Items removed Dropped Item Notes Spirit based drink Replaced by gin which has been attracting increased expenditure. On sales of spirit based drinks are still in the baskets. Apple cider, bottle Replaced by a combination of canned apple cider and bottled flavoured cider reflecting the availability of the various products in outlets. Mentholated cigarettes Removed. This item currently has low coverage and the EU Tobacco Products Directive 2014 will see distinguishable flavours including menthol banned from 2020. Single drainer sink Removed. This class is well-covered and the product’s removal enables items to be added elsewhere. Brake pads Removed as a separate item from the price collection across the UK but will continue to be covered as part of a spare parts item for which prices are collected centrally over the internet. Spare parts and accessories is an over-covered part of the baskets. Mobile phone handset Removed. The number of models available and expenditure are falling as people increasingly switch to smartphones. Child’s swing Replaced by a child’s scooter as the number of price quotes collected each month has been falling reflecting its availability in shops particularly in the winter months. Apple cider Replaced by a broader cider item which will enable prices of apple, pear and flavoured ciders to be collected. Fee for stopping a cheque Removed. This is an over-covered part of the baskets and these fees have a low weight reflecting the fall in cheque usage.

Red meat lover SARA MALM shows it can be done even on a tight budget By Sara Malm For The Mail On Sunday Published: 17:59 EDT, 18 March 2017 | Updated: 21:44 EDT, 18 March 2017 e-mail 92 shares 158 View comments Impossible, ridiculous, unachievable. That seemed to be the general consensus at the suggestion last month by scientists that eating five portions a day of fruit and veg wasn’t enough and if we wanted to live longer, healthier, cancer-free lives, we needed TEN a day. Doing so lowered the risk of stroke by 33 per cent, cancer by 13 per cent and premature death by 31 per cent, said a team of experts at Imperial College London. But, given that the average Briton manages fewer than three a day as it is, it was also perhaps wishful thinking. Just one in five of us manage the five a day currently recommended by the NHS. Ten a day is easy according to Sara Malm who stocked up on fruit and vegetables online and then portioned them up to make it simple during the week Others warned that upping fruit-and-veg intake would be a financial struggle for many. But how hard can it be? I set out to see just how do-able ten a day is, both in practical terms and cost-wise. As a diehard meat-eater, I worried it would be an unrealistic (and unpleasant) gear shift. My friends laughed when I told them my plan. And it did take planning.

Share this article Share 92 shares My usual method of deciding what to have for dinner while whizzing round the food store after work went out of the window, replaced by an extensive shopping list for the week – variety, say nutrition experts, is key to benefiting from the widest range of vitamins and minerals. And I found that the preparing and eating of ten a day was pretty easy. It also didn’t cost much: I calculated that over five days, I ate just £5.13 worth of fruit and veg. That’s a pound a day, give or take. To eat five – let alone ten – portions of something in one day sparks visions of plates piled high with broccoli and blueberries; but when you look at it all laid out, it’s not a lot. Here’s how I managed… MY TEN-A-DAY SHOPPING LIST  I shopped on tesco.com because I’m familiar with the website. To work out how much I got for my money, I divided the weight of each item by 80g – NHS-recommended portion size for fresh fruit and veg. For dried fruit, like sultanas, it’s 30g; for juice, one portion is 150ml. For peeling fruit, I looked up the weight without peel; for tinned veg, I used the drained weight. Then I divided the price by the number of portions to give the cost per portion. *All items Tesco own brand unless stated Everyday Value Baked Beans In Tomato Sauce 420g, 24p 5.25 portions; 9.6p/portion Everyday Value Sweetcorn 325g, 35p (drained weight 260g) 3.25 portions; 10.7p/portion Butter Beans 400g, 50p (drained weight 235g) 2.9 portions; 17p/portion Everyday Value Chopped Tomatoes 400g, 31p 5 portions; 6.2p/portion Green Beans 850g, 85p 10.6 portions; 8p/portion Iceberg Lettuce 400g, 70p 5 portions; 14p/per portion Everyday Value Mixed Vegetables 1.16kg, 89p 14.5portions; 6.1p/portion Mixed Fruits 500g, £2 6.25 portions; 32p/portion Root Vegetable Medley 1kg, 89p 12.5 portions; 7.1p/portion Courgettes Pre Packed 500g, 89p 6.25 portions; 14.2p/portion Broccoli 390g, 43p 4.9 portions; 9p/portion Pure Orange Juice 2 litres, £1.34 13 portions; 10.5p/portion Everyday Value Sultanas 500g, 89p 16.7 portions; 5.3p/portion Braeburn Apple Minimum 5 Pack 670g, 79p 8.4 portions; 9.4p/portion Suntrail Farms Ripen At Home Plum 400g, 68p 5 portions; 13.6p/portion Six Bananas, 78p 9 portions; 8.6p/portion TOTAL COST OF SHOPPING: £12.53  (all costs relate to fruit and veg)  DAY ONE  Breakfast: Pre-gym banana, post-workout oats with apple and sultanas, orange juice.  Portions: 4.5  Cost: 27.7p Lunch: None Afternoon snack: Plum.  Portions: 1  Cost: 13.6p Dinner Salmon with 240g butterbean and root vegetable (parsnip, carrot, swede) mash, a banana for dessert. Portions: 4.5  Cost: 54.7p TOTAL PORTIONS: 10 TOTAL COST: 96p The first thing that surprised me as I sat down to work out exactly what I would eat each day was that I was already getting my five a day pretty much without thinking about it. One vegetable or fruit portion is 80g, according to NHS guidelines. That’s fresh, raw weight, so it can be less when cooked and containing less water. For instance, a portion of dried fruit is just 30g. ‘Of course, you don’t want to eat too much dried fruit,’ says Mail on Sunday nutritional therapist Jackie Lynch.  ‘It is high in sugar, but a handful like this a day gives you about 17g of sugar, which isn’t really that much of a concern if you’re not eating lots of added sugar and junk.’ Jackie points out that a banana, peeled, weighs 120g – that’s one-and-a-half portions. She adds: ‘You can have more than one portion of a fruit or veg simply by eating the whole thing.’ A typical day for me starts with a banana if I’m heading to the gym. For breakfast I’ll have oats with fruit – an apple and some sultanas – or scrambled or boiled eggs with peanut butter. Lunch will be yogurt, fruit or a protein bar. Dinner is always meat or fish, with veg, either broccoli or my favourite, cauliflower mash. To make my very unscientific experiment as accurate as possible, I invested in a set of electronic food scales. At home, I dutifully weighed out 80g of butter beans and 160g of root veg – parsnip, swede and a bit of carrot – and mashed it all up with some cream and a little bit of rosemary to have with my pan-fried salmon. Another banana for pud and I’d hit my target. DAY TWO  Breakfast: Banana pancakes with bacon, peanut butter and an apple. Portions: 2.5  Cost: 22.4p Lunch: Left-over salmon and bean and root veg mash, orange juice. Portions: 3 Cost: 24.7p Cocktail: Frozen mixed-berry daiquiris (120g mixed berries). Portions: 1.5 Cost: 48p Dinner: Chicken thighs with mixed vegetables (160g) and green beans (80g). Portions: 3 Cost: 20.2p TOTAL: 10 TOTAL COST: £1.16 The best thing about this challenge is that it does not in any way affect any of the other things I eat. No one said I couldn’t serve every single meal on this menu with a side of bacon – after all, this is about eating veg, not what I eat with it. So for breakfast, I have banana pancakes (one-and-a-half portions) with an apple and a side of bacon. After lunch, I begin weighing and portioning for the remaining 17 meals of the challenge. Not surprisingly, it ends up taking up a large chunk of my valuable non-work hours, which I resent hugely. Exasperated, I text a friend who happens to work in a bar. I ask: ‘If I bring my own berries, can you put them in a daiquiri?’ When I arrive, she raises an eyebrow as I hold up a plastic bag containing two handfuls of sad and soggy half-frozen assorted berries. ‘Don’t ask,’ I say. ‘Just chuck it in a blender and get me a straw.’ Frankly, I was glad I’d had a drink before ‘enjoying’ my frozen vegetables. Back home, I put them all in a pot, cover and cook while trying not to let them go mushy. Two recent studies found that frozen fruit and veg can be healthier than fresh, with higher levels of vitamins and cancer-fighting antioxidants. However, I have to say that in terms of taste, I’m not a fan. They remind me of aircraft food. DAY THREE  Breakfast: Almost full English: Bacon, eggs, baked beans (80g) and tomatoes (80g), orange juice. Portions: 3  Cost: 26.3p Snack: An apple and handful of sultanas. Portions: 2  Cost: 14.7p Lunch: Toast with peanut butter, banana. Portions: 1.5  Cost: 13p Dinner: Roast beef with roasted root vegetables (160g carrots and parsnip), broccoli (80g); ice cream with frozen berries (80g) for dessert. Portions: 4  Cost: 55p TOTAL: 10.5 TOTAL COST: £1.09 Baked beans in chunky tomato sauce is two of my ten a day. And I can have it with bacon! This suits me perfectly. In preparation for what I know is set to be an epic Sunday roast, I keep the lunch light, and have banana and peanut butter on toast. I serve myself a lovely plate of beef, duck-fat potatoes, Yorkshire pudding and gravy served with parsnips, carrots and broccoli. It is no bigger than my normal plate of roast, and I’m putting away at least three portions of veg. And I can have dessert afterwards, so really, what’s not to like? DAY FOUR Breakfast: Yogurt, banana, sultanas.  Portions: 2.5  Cost: 18.3p Lunch: Salmon salad with double lettuce.  Portions: 2  Cost: 28p Snacks: Plum, carrot.  Portions: 2  Cost: 20.7p Dinner Pork belly, double broccoli (160g) sweetcorn (80g), green beans (80g).  Portions: 4  Cost: 36.7p TOTAL: 10.5 TOTAL COST: £1.03 My ability to ignore food-related decision-making – thanks to Saturday’s prep – is welcome as Monday work stress begins. Because I was really trying to keep costs down, I’ve ended up avoiding (slightly) pricier leafy green veg, but Jackie Lynch feels this is a negative thing in terms of nutrition. She says: ‘Greens are an important source of magnesium, B vitamins and iron as well as protective antioxidants.’ One option, if you’re watching the budget, would be frozen spinach. You can get a 900g (11-portion) bag for £1.40, which works out at about 12p per portion. But, sadly, it suffers from the mush effect when you cook it. A 500g (six-portion) bag of fresh spinach costs £2, making it 33p per portion, while a 300g (three-and-three-quarter-portion) bag of mixed greens costs £1, or 26p per portion. So, again, even if you decide to widen your variety of vegetables, it need not be cost-prohibitive. DAY FIVE  Breakfast: Oats with an apple and sultanas, orange juice.  Portions: 3  Cost: 25.2p Snack: A carrot.  Portions: 1  Cost: 7.1p Lunch: Pork belly left-overs with broccoli (160g) and salad (80g).  Portions: 3  Cost: 18p Snack: Banana.  Portions: 1.5  Cost: 13p Dinner: Spaghetti with chunky tomato (160g) and courgette (80g) sauce. Portions: 3  Cost: 26.6p TOTAL: 11.5 TOTAL COST: 89.9p TOTAL COST FOR FIVE DAYS (AND 52.5 PORTIONS): £5.14 I’m interested to see what these past few days has done to my weight. The scales tell me I’ve gained about 2.5 lb, which is likely to be down to water retention. Jackie is impressed: ‘You’ve done well to skew the ratio in favour of vegetables, so intake of sugary fruit is moderate.’ I wasn’t perfect, though. Jackie says: ‘I’d prefer to see more fresh fruit, because over five days the sultanas and fruit juice contain more sugar than two Mars bars. Fruit with an edible skin, such as apples or pears, is much lower in sugar and provides more fibre, which is vital for a healthy digestion. ‘I think your protein intake may have suffered at times – on Friday you’re running all day on just fruit and veg, which might mean energy levels flag. ‘Adding a good dose of protein-rich nuts or seeds to Friday’s breakfast would help neutralise the sugary dried fruit and boost energy throughout the morning.’ Did can you do ten-a-day on a budget? Yes. However, planning and budgeting and weighing – and eating soggy frozen veg – was a bit of a nightmare. For anyone who is time-pressed, trying to stick to the target might be difficult.

Chance The Rapper Earns $500K From Apple For His Album Coloring Book Home News Madison Silvers March 18th, 2017 - 2:04 PM Buy music on this topic at | Amazon Photo Credit: Mauricio Alvarado While adult “coloring books” seem to be all of the rage these days, Chance The Rapper‘s 2016 album Coloring Book seems to leave more controversy in it’s wake than the stress-free ease now associated with the former. Although last year’s hip-hop album, by the artist also known as Chancelor Johnathan Bennett, celebrated critical acclaim,  recent ponderings question the legitimacy of Chance’s self-proclaimed title as an “independent artist”. According to Spin Magazine, Fans seem to be suspicious of all of this marketed independence— especially since news of the rapper’s $500,000 contract with Apple Music came to head. The recording artist, previous to his last record, shared his mix-tapes on Soundcloud for free. However, 2016’s Coloring Book entered into public consumption via an exclusive two-week stint on Apple’s music-streaming service. But, then it went back onto Chance The Rapper’s Soundcloud page, following, subsequently, in suit of all of his previous works. The hip-hop artist’s signature on Apple’s dotted line, and the resulting appearance on an Apple commercial leaves listeners and advocates of independent artists with a sour taste in their mouth. Apparently, snuggling up with one of the largest companies in the world isn’t as kosher as Chance The Rapper might have thought. Questions of transparency have come up, and in lieu of this “grey area” currently hovering over the artist’s album and his career, past deals with Kit Kat, a Nestlé-owned company, and his wide-eyed desire for a Grammy, further this cloudy debacle. The Rapper has recently taken to his twitter account, after keeping quiet on the issue, to explain himself and his contract with Apple. Chance maintains his beliefs that he is still an indie rapper, and that he is transparent as ever. Tags apple music Chance the Rapper Tweet Comments Madison Silvers Hi. My name is Madi. Meow.

All the while, other tech companies never seem to grapple with similar demands from analysts and pundits. Whereas Apple needs to outdo the iPhone, we never hear calls for Facebook to come up with a social network killer or for Google to come up with a product that will obsolete the search engine. Don't Miss: Leak shows a stunning Galaxy S8 in a stolen Jet Black finish The iPhone’s 10th anniversary earlier this year sparked a number of opinion pieces proclaiming that the iPhone has peaked and that it’s time for Apple to deliver an iPhone killer, a futuristic device that will obsolete the iPhone in the same way that Apple’s iconic smartphone quickly rendered the iPod outdated. Writing for Wired, Davey Alba opined that the iPhone — of all things — is actually slowing Apple down and that the company must figure out what’s next. Now Apple is facing a turning point, and once again the iPhone is the reason—but not in a good way this time around. The smartphone market is saturated. Rivals, especially Google, are building hardware that truly rivals the iPhone. After 10 years, the iPhone can no longer serve as Apple’s growth engine. The company now faces the same challenge it did a decade ago: figuring out what’s next. It’s not an unfair point, but it conveniently overlooks the fact that Apple has become rather adept at extracting more dollars from existing iPhone owners via its burgeoning suite of services. Whether it’s the App Store — which recorded its most profitable day in company history not too long ago — or the growing popularity of Apple Music, Apple has figured out a few ways to pad its bottom line even as iPhone sales growth did an about-face this past year. Meanwhile, a piece in Forbes from earlier this year took an even bolder position, arguing that Apple must build an iPhone killer. Which means it’s time for Apple to kill the iPhone…not in one fell swoop, of course, and not as the intended goal… No matter how innovative your product or service once was, sticking to incrementalism in order to most efficiency milk the maximum amount of revenue out of it is a losing proposition. As your incremental change curve flattens out, the development that will [obsolete you] will be disappearing in your windshield before… you ever noticed it approaching in your rear-view mirror. It’s time for Apple to build the iPhone killer. The only problem is that doing so is impossible. The original iPhone was a revolutionary device that quickly transformed the smartphone into an indispensable part of the way we live. And because its functionality is wildly expansive and limited only by the imagination of third-party developers, it’s utility isn’t artificially stunted in the way that the iPod’s was. The smartphone in general, and the iPhone in particular, isn’t going anywhere because it functions as a portal of sorts; its utility is always expanding as its hardware improves and new software is developed. Looking ahead, for example, the upcoming iPhone 8 is said to feature advanced augmented reality functionality that may very well transform the way we use our smartphones. The fact of the matter is that some products become so entrenched in our everyday lives that the notion of killing them off simply isn’t realistic. Notice how we never hear calls for anyone to develop a TV killer or for Google to develop search engine killer. Truly revolutionary products and technologies have extremely long shelf lives that can’t be obsoleted on an arbitrary time frame. The iPod’s demise at the hands of the iPhone was an exception, not the rule. Put simply, the iPhone isn’t going anywhere no matter what type of product area Apple opts to enter. Curiously, some people have even argued that a more advanced version of the Apple Watch might eventually replace the iPhone. These claims, I believe, completely overlook the fact that a big and easily accessible smartphone display can never be replaced by even the most intuitive software on a watch or a pair of AR glasses. Point being, there’s never going to be an iPhone killer, only new and advanced iPhones that render previous models obsolete. Read More Having said that, Apple still doesn’t seem to get the credit it deserves for continually rolling out, with absolutely no aberration, impressive advances in iPhone technology year after year. From huge leaps in hardware performance to incredible improvements in camera technology, Apple has managed to steadily and substantially improve the iPhone user experience every single year for 9 years running. And with the iPhone 8 looming on the horizon, the next leap in performance and design may be the biggest one yet. Just last quarter, Apple posted a new quarterly record for iPhone sales. And yet, for reasons that defy explanation, some pundits would have you believe that Apple is in dire straits and desperately in need of rolling out an iPhone killer.

The announcement comes as Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook undertakes his latest trip to a country that ranks as Apple’s single biggest overseas market. Apple said it plans to build new research facilities in the eastern Chinese cities of Shanghai and Suzhou, on top of centres already slated for Beijing and the southern city of Shenzhen. It also pledged to spend at least 3.5 billion yuan ($507 million) on research institutions. All four centres will open later this year, the company said in a statement on its Chinese website. They will help Apple cooperate with local partners and attract talent from its local suppliers as well as from top educational institutes, according to its press release. The announcement came a day before Cook is scheduled to address a high-profile economic forum in Beijing, where senior government officials will confer with the heads of some of the world’s biggest corporations, including Royal Dutch Shell and Saudi Arabian Oil. Foreign companies have a long-established tradition of building research bases in China to both signal their commitment to the country and curry favour with the government. Apple’s announcement comes after iPhone shipments fell for the first time in China on an annual basis, in 2016.  China had for years driven Apple’s spectacular growth, even as smartphone demand elsewhere faltered. But local vendors like Huawei Technologies Co., Oppo and Vivo are now eroding its market share with increasingly high-end devices. The U.S. company is counting on the release of the 10th anniversary iPhone later this year to supercharge growth.

Online auction house, Breker is including one in its forthcoming sale of "Office Antiques, Science & Technology, Fine Toys & Automata" to be held on May, 20, 2017. So why so much interest in 40-year old technology?   Auction Team Breker's recent newsletter reports: Our May auction features the best-preserved example of an Apple-1 computer to have appeared on the market. Not only does this Apple-1 (serial-no. 01-0073) come direct from its original owner, a computer engineer from Berkeley, California, it is accompanied by an archive of original documents, including the preliminary operation manual, circuit diagrams and even notes of telephone calls with Steve Wozniak in 1977. This computer is logged as No. 14 in Willegal’s Apple I Registry. In view of its condition and pedigree the estimate of € 180,000 – 300,000 equivalent to US$ 190,000 – 320,000 seems low until you notice that there is no mention of it being in "working condition" or "functioning", which would make it very rare as there are reckoned to be only around eight such models extant, which is an increase on the six that we previously quoted.  The Breker home page still includes one of them, billed as "Original Apple 1 Computer, 1976" as the centrepiece of its examples of recent sales. This is for a model it sold on May 25th 2013 setting a world record price, see our report Apple 1 Sold For Record Price of $668K. Not only was this in fully working condition, its motherboard also has "Woz" written on it, presumably by Steve Wozniak himself.  The previous top price for an Apple 1 was also in a Breker auction and was $640,000 in November 2014, again for a working model. Currently the record is held by Bonhams that sold another functioning version for $905,000 in New York. Even if the Apple 1 in the forthcoming sale isn't in a functioning condition it is still rare and collectible. In total 66 Apple 1s are listed on the Apple 1 Registry maintained by Mike Willegal but this isn't a definitive figure as this quote from the site shows: How Many Apple 1s Exist? Besides those listed here, I have heard through the grapevine of several more.  It is also probable that the first 4 units on the list (and possibly more) have been lost.  There are undoubtedly a number that are still not known to me or or my friends.  It is very possible that some of the poorer documented units on this list could be duplicates.  It would be rather surprising if as many as 66 are still around. There were only two production runs of Apple 1s which resulted in only 200 being built. Of these 175 were sold before Apple dropped the model from price list in October 1997 in order to sell the Apple II. The number of models in circulation could have been further limited as Apple 1 owners were offered trade-in deals to upgrade. It had been thought that Apple destroyed the returned Apple 1s, but this comment on Andrew Cunningham's news item on Ars Technica  about the upcoming auction suggests this may not have been deliberate: The Apple I systems that were traded in for Apple IIs were all stored in a room at Apple's HQ in Cupertino (in the Mariani I building as I recall) and largely forgotten. Some years later, Apple decided to start a small museum of company products, and staff went to that room to get one for display. But the room was now used for something completely different and there were no sign of the Apple I systems. Nobody knew where they had gone, and nobody owned up to having removed them or to ordering the room to be cleaned out. That's why Apple I systems are so scarce. The company actually had to purchase an Apple I for the museum. With the Apple 1 reaching its 40th anniversary next month, we are now keen to preserve its history. An early prototype, the "Celebration" Apple1 was expected to raise $1 million at an  online auction organised by Charitybuzz was expected to raise $1 million, but the winning bid was only $815,000 and new owners, co-founders of the cosmetics company Glamglow Glenn and Shannon Dellimore see the board that they purchased as a museum peice or work of art and were quoted in our report, Unique Apple I Sold At Auction, as saying: "Talking to historians and museums and auction houses, this particular Apple-1 in 10 to 15 years, could be worth as much as a Monet or Picasso."    More Information Auction Team Breker Related Articles Apple 1 Sold For Record Price of $668K Apple 1 Breaks Records In Online Auction Rare Apple I Available at Auction Milestones in the history of Apple Unique Apple I Sold At Auction Steve Jobs and Apple Steve Wozniak   To be informed about new articles on I Programmer, sign up for our weekly newsletter, subscribe to the RSS feed and follow us on, Twitter, Facebook, Google+ or Linkedin.   //No Comment - Turmits are Turing-universal, The Whale Swarm Algorithm & Rules That Govern Fish 21/02/2017 • Nontrivial Turmites are Turing-universal • Whale swarm algorithm for function optimization • What Is the Rule that Gives Rise to Coordinated Swimming in Fish?  + Full Story Apple Dev Conference Moves To San Jose 20/02/2017  Apple has moved its Worldwide Developers Conference to San Jose to get more space, having outgrown the Moscone West Conference Center in San Francisco. + Full Story More News //No Comment - Trojan of Things, Disk LEDs Leak Data & So Do Phone Magnetometers Google's Jack & Jill Android Java Compiler Project Is Dead Komodo 10.2 Adds Slack Sharing //No Comment - Inside Boston Dynamics - Update Raspberry Pi For Teachers on Future Learn Google Home Voice Ad Causes A Reaction Android About To Overtake Windows On Internet Patently Ridiculous - Google Ordered To Pay $20 Million Plus Google Goes Serverless with Cloud Functions Pi Zero Wireless A $10 Birthday Present Self Driving Car Challenge SHAKEY The Robot Honored Registration Open For Code Jam 2017         Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. blog comments powered by Disqus Last Updated ( Saturday, 18 March 2017 )     Follow @Iprogrammerinfo     RSS feed of news items only Copyright © 2017 i-programmer.info.

Apple native email supports auto-download of images and supports CSS3 coding, video, and GIF playback out-of-the-box. Hence, email marketers can experiment with different elements that increase the overall user interactivity. By increasing the user interactivity within the emails, your subscriber tends to spend more time with your emails, and this in turn helps in conversion.  Effects that were only achieved on webpages using Javascript are now possible with keyframe animations. Animations such as flutter, flip, dissolve or zoom out when clicked or tapped raise user’s curiosity and this leverages into improved UX.  Animations made possible using Keyframe animation Rotating Banner & Slider in Email Accordion in Email Interactive Menu in Email Integrated Forms in Email Video Playback in Email Animated GIF in Email And many more… Is all love lost for other email clients?! Just because Apple devices support different interactive elements doesn’t make it exclusive. GIF playback is supported in most of the widely used email clients. Android Native client and Thunderbird are second to Apple in terms of compatibility in mobile and desktop respectively. Moreover, for the non-supporting email clients, appropriate fallback options ensure that user experience is not broken.  Our latest infographic, titled ‘Email advancements for Apple Subscribers’, lists all of the possible interactive elements, along with sample emails for consideration.

Arts & Entertainment Music Chance the Rapper's Apple deal — still independent, in control Chance the Rapper Zbigniew Bzdak / Chicago Tribune Chance the Rapper announced a $1 million donation to Chicago Public Schools after meeting with Gov. Bruce Rauner. Chance the Rapper announced a $1 million donation to Chicago Public Schools after meeting with Gov. Bruce Rauner. (Zbigniew Bzdak / Chicago Tribune) Greg KotContact Reporter Privacy Policy In recent days, Chance the Rapper has come under scrutiny from his massive fan base for how he conducts business. Though his music has drawn acclaim, his notion of how to release that music — free, direct to fans — has earned him praise as a revolutionary. The 23-year-old artist, who grew up on the South Side and began releasing mixtapes while still roaming the halls of Jones College Prep High School, found himself a triple Grammy Award winner in February, even though he hadn't yet sold a single piece of recorded music. MOST READ ENTERTAINMENT NEWS THIS HOUR On Friday, Chance took to Twitter because he felt compelled to explain a deal he negotiated last spring with Apple Music. The digital music platform paid Chance $500,000 and financed a TV commercial for exclusive rights to the "Coloring Book" album. After two weeks on the Apple site, the album became available for free at multiple online outlets. "I never felt the need to correct folks on my relationship with @apple but now that more people have tried to discredit my independence, I wanna clear things up," he wrote. "I needed the money and they're all good people over there. I feel like if I didn't clear it up people would keep trying to discredit all the work we did to make Coloring Book what it became. I think (an) artist can gain a lot from the streaming wars as long as they remain in control of their own product." Later, he advised artists that "If you come across opportunities to work with good people, pick up cash and keep your integrity I say Do It." The message behind the series of tweets: Don't put me in a box. And, by extension, don't allow yourself to be put in a box. The late, great Prince would be proud. The Minneapolis funk master, who died last April, was both praised and pilloried for his unconventional business practices. In many ways he created a blueprint for what Chance is doing now. After chafing under the major-label restrictions imposed on his music for nearly two decades, Prince went independent in the mid-'90s and became one of the first major artists to embrace the internet to communicate with and market music directly to his fans. He later began licensing his albums one at a time to major labels to benefit from their distribution while retaining ownership of his music. In the same way, Chance is experimenting with using corporate clout and cash to expand the reach of his music. In recent interviews, he has discussed the importance of artists finding a way to use the system to serve their music, rather than becoming servants of the industry — as Prince once felt he had become before breaking free. Though some of his fans would surely love Chance to remain that kid who handed them a copy of his mixtape on the streetcorner, this is an artist who thinks big, and the Apple deal was just part of the larger canvas on which he's painting. He staged a major multiracial music festival in U.S. Cellular Field last year, led a rally in Millennium Park on Election Day in November, recently met with Gov. Bruce Rauner and donated $1 million to Chicago Public Schools. His albums and videos aren't just solo efforts but incorporate a community of artists — musicians, singers, producers, video directors, dancers. It's telling that the first major project he focused on after the 2013 "Acid Rap" mixtape made him a national figure was "Surf," an album helmed by his trumpet player, Nico Segal. By framing his music as the work of a community, Chance is on to something much bigger than a deal with a corporate power. Just as Prince did before him, Chance is demonstrating that it's time to put artists in charge of their futures — led by a generation of creatives who Chance believes can fundamentally change the way art is made, distributed and consumed. greg@gregkot.com Twitter @gregkot RELATED STORIES: Judge: Financial information in Chance the Rapper case stays confidential Chance the Rapper writes $1 million check to CPS as a 'call to action' Stephen Colbert, Chance the Rapper team up to reimagine 'Arthur' theme Who had a better year: Chance the Rapper or Kanye West?

When wanderlust took over, he digitized his entire library into about 50,000 portable MP3s that he could take wherever he traveled. The music industry has become increasingly populated by streaming services that offer a similar ability to listen to music anywhere, but the lack of ownership concerns Fragomeni. In the age of Spotify, Apple Music, Pandora, and Tidal, the self-professed music collector saw an opportunity to cater to listeners like himself who want to own their music. Alongside co-founder Aprile Elcich, he created Voltra, a digital music player and store that promises artists who sign up directly with Voltra will receive 100 percent of the revenue from the streams and purchases of their songs. Voltra is a response to the growing dominance of streaming services in the contemporary music landscape. Spotify currently boasts more than 50 million subscribers, while Apple Music reached 20 million subscribers at the end of last year. Yet Fragomeni, whose previous startup venture Nodejitsu was acquired by GoDaddy in 2015, believes there will always be dedicated connoisseurs who are interested in actually owning music. “There’s a pretty significant population of people who collect and own music, and I think that product space was a little bit neglected,” he says. “As music lovers, we really wanted to have a product that was totally focused on music ownership.” Voltra’s desktop and mobile players — currently in beta testing — are free to download. Any users with a Voltra account can choose to either buy songs immediately or try out a new song with Voltra’s “stream-to-own” feature. It allows users to listen to an entire song once for free and then pay a small fee for each consecutive listen. After the 10th play, the track is fully paid for and officially owned by the user. Though artists and labels are able to opt out of the stream-to-own option, Fragomeni says the majority of Voltra’s catalog will be available with this feature. For Fragomeni, this model offers listeners a low-cost way to figure out if they enjoy a particular song while also ensuring that artists earn money off the songs that get played the most. Eliminating the 30-second free preview is a particular point of pride for Fragomeni: “Thirty-second previews actually suck, because you might totally miss this really awesome guitar solo at 1:10, but that got cut off from the preview, so you never decide that you’re going to buy that song.” Image: Voltra Voltra users can also purchase a premium membership upgrade for $10 a month. Premium members still pay for individual tracks, but they also receive access to the Voltra Audio Archive, which automatically backs up the listener’s music files to Amazon Glacier storage. Fragomeni views the premium option as targeted toward “users who are invested in owning music and want a secure and long-term music archiving solution.” This emphasis on lasting storage contrasts with subscription-based streaming services, where canceling your account comes with the risk of losing personally curated playlists and listening history. Fragomeni views Voltra as having an “ethical mission” in which “it’s really important for us to create a relationship between artists and listeners.” To accomplish this, Voltra encourages the discovery of new music for its users to own. Fragomeni describes Voltra’s music player and store as “symbiotic,” since the app generates song recommendations for users based on the music they already own. Voltra aims to strengthen two facets of this artist-listener relationship: If music ownership is Voltra’s priority for listeners, sufficient compensation is the company’s goal for artists. Both Fragomeni and Elcich have spent time playing in bands, and they continue to surround themselves with musicians. With the peer-to-peer opportunities of the internet age, Fragomeni recalls that the pair began to question why there were “so many middlemen taking a cut from artists who are trying to sell their music.” So the co-founders decided that artists who sign up directly through Voltra would receive 100 percent of their earnings, since the company doesn’t deduct a commission from their song profits. This applies to artists who sell their music directly on Voltra; with labels and distributors, Voltra takes a cut of ten percent. It’s also free for artists to upload their music to Voltra’s store. Voltra — which is not ad-supported — earns additional revenue from its sale of Pro Features to artists, labels, and distributors for five to ten dollars a month, offering musicians additional perks like customizable sales reports or a public artist page on the Voltra site. “The ultimate ethical objective is to try to have the artists be paid.” Fragomeni cites his view that artists — particularly independent artists — are not earning enough revenue from popular streaming services as one of the inspirations for his company’s business model. As Voltra prepares to launch publicly, songwriters and their representatives are currently appearing before the Copyright Royalty Board to argue for an increase in their per-stream earning rate from companies like Alphabet, Apple, Pandora, and Spotify. The Voltra team points to data from the artists’ rights blog The Trichordist, which claims that a musician can earn 99 cents after only 10 streams on Voltra, compared to 226 streams on Spotify, 134 on Apple Music, and 146 on Google Play. Spotify’s average payout per stream reportedly ranges from $0.006 to $0.0084, which is split among the the music's various "rights holders,” meaning that 226 streams would yield about $1.50, of which the artist would receive some portion. Resonate, a “streaming music cooperative” that began development last year, offers a stream-to-own system that is similar to Voltra’s — Resonate listeners fully pay for a track after nine plays — though Resonate deducts the standard streaming service commission of 30 percent of revenue, according to Forbes. “I feel like it’s weird that [Voltra’s business model] is novel,” Fragomeni says, “but I really believe that it’s possible to have a sustainable business with really cool premium services where the ultimate ethical objective is to try to have the artists be paid.” According to Fragomeni, about 5,000 participants have already registered in Voltra’s beta test, and the store offers nearly 3 million tracks. (For comparison, Spotify currently features more than 30 million songs.) Voltra aims to go live after reaching 10 million tracks, with Fragomeni tentatively projecting a launch date in late May.

The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has awarded Apple three patents that add fitness and biometric features to earbuds quite like the recently released AirPods. The patents, called "Earbuds with Biometric Sensing," are capable of collecting a person's biometric information by pressing up against a part of the ear called the tragus. MORE: Best Wireless Headphones According to the patents, which were earlier discovered by Patently Apple, once the earbuds have been inserted into the ears, they'll shine a light on the tragus and measure the reflective properties off the feature. That information can be used to ensure the person wearing the earbuds is the authorized owner. Credit: USPTOMore Credit: USPTOAdditionally, the earbud patents suggest ways for Apple's technology to deliver noise-canceling features. According to the patents, Apple would allow audio that was registered within a 10- to 20-degree window in and would ban all other audio from reaching your ears. The noise-canceling feature could also be used to screen all audio, including voices. When Tom's Guide reviewed the AirPods, we liked their design, battery life and the ability to seamless connect to iOS devices. But there's always room for improvement, and adding features like biometrics and noise-canceling could go a long way in helping the AirPods compete against other wireless options. It's not clear at this point how biometrics might fit into Apple's plans. While it appears to be a way to authenticate you to use the earbuds, could it also be used down the road as a Touch ID-like function? The possibilities are endless. But like anything Apple-related, take all of these patents with the proverbial grain of salt. Like other tech companies, Apple constantly files for patents on technologies that might never come to its devices. These biometric earbuds could fall into that category.

You have until July to add an additional 2 years of Apple Care for $249, which would cover you until July 2019. I bought it in July 2016 and have used it roughly a few times per week since buying. Specs: 8-core 3.0ghz, 64gb RAM, 1tb SSD, Dual D700 GPUs. Super fast, super quiet machine. Will be very sad to see it go but I need the money to buy a portable editing rig. Comes with original packaging, power cable, Magic Mouse and Magic Keyboard. I bought the G-Speed Studio XL 48TB Thunderbolt 2 in late September 2016, and used it a few times per week along with the Mac Pro. It comes with a 3-year factory warranty, so you will be covered until late September 2019. I left the plastic shrink-wrap on most the exterior (not covering the fan obviously), so the housing looks 100% brand new. This unit has 8 slots. Right now 6 of the 8 slots contain 8TB drives, the other 2 slots are “EV” bays. You can add 1 or 2 additional 8TB drives and expand the capacity of the unit, or you can add other modules like the G-Tech EV RED Minimag Reader (included), which pops right into the slot. If you shoot RED or Arri, this is an awesome data management system (they also make a Cfast EV Reader for this unit).

The rivalry between Apple and Samsung is the most talked about subject in the smartphone industry. The two companies are always looking for new features that can be added to their flagship smartphones so that they one-up each other. What’s interesting is that sometimes, both of them mimic what the other is doing. Rumor has it that Samsung is looking to make use of Apple’s 3D Touch display technology. Samsung Galaxy S8 to Feature Pressure-Sensitive Home Key Apple has already used this technology starting with iPhone 6S and now, Samsung is looking to implement this pressure-sensitive technology on the highly anticipated Galaxy Note 8. In fact, rumor has it that Samsung has already managed to make this technology fit with its OLED panels. Even better, during the Mobile World Congress event Samsung has showcased the said technology to different partner companies. Leaked pictures of Samsung’s Galaxy S8 flagship smartphone have showed that the South Korean tech giant has implemented a new edge-to-edge display. The same display is expected to be used on Galaxy Note 8 as well. The reason why this matters is because Galaxy S8’s bezels have been shrunk and the physical Home Key button has been removed. Galaxy Note 8 is expected to receive the same treatment, the difference being that Note 8 will feature a “virtual home button” that’s going to be equipped with this pressure-sensitive technology. Additionally, the virtual Home button will also feature a fingerprint sensor. The new Home button opens the door for many possibilities, for example Galaxy Note 8 owners are going to be able to open up different types of menus by hard-pressing on virtual button. We should mention that Samsung has already meddled with 3D Touch OLED panels before. The South Korean tech giant has manufactured the special 3D Touch displays that have been installed on smartphones such as Huawei 9. At the moment, everything we know is based on rumors therefore Samsung might decide to not equip Galaxy Note 8 with this technology. Nonetheless, once Galaxy Note 8 comes out it will definitely make waves in the tech industry. We can be sure that Galaxy Note 8 will be near-flawless considering the fiasco caused by Galaxy Note 7.

Name: Subject: Message: New colors and headphone ports: the new smartphone “features” Features Newsby Kris Carlon3 days ago 42 1114 16 I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: smartphones are so good these days that they’re almost all basically “good enough”. Camera performance stepped up across the board a few years ago and battery life in 2017 is pretty much guaranteed to get you through a busy day. Fast charging is widespread, build quality is exceptional and water-resistant ratings are becoming the norm. But are companies that desperate for differentiation now that the simple presence of a headphone port or a new color suddenly becomes a unique selling point? See also: Will ‘bezel-less’ be the big smartphone design trend of 2017? January 20, 2017 When Apple dropped the 3.5 mm headphone port on the iPhone 7 it claimed it was being courageous, but we all know it was really just about encouraging the sale of wireless AirPods. The included lightning connector EarPods and lightning to 3.5 mm adapter showed just how timid Apple’s courage truly was, but ever since then, smug OEMs that haven’t done anything differently since before the iPhone 7 announcement suddenly felt the need to make a big deal out of the fact their new phone still had a headphone port. Let me put this clearly: a headphone port is not a feature. Neither is a charging port or volume buttons or an IR blaster. They are just things that are there (or not). If some company down the road decides to remove the charging port entirely in favor of wireless charging, are other OEMs going to spontaneously start crowing about how their phones still feature a charging port? Let me put this clearly: a headphone port is not a feature. The change from microUSB to USB Type-C is equally uninteresting to me. It just is. If a company removes the headphone port but provides me with cabled headphones that work and an adapter for my other headphones, I don’t see the big deal. Likewise, if a company includes a charging brick that supplies my new phone with power, what do I care what the end of it looks like? USB Type-C is a new standard, not a feature. I’ve written before about nitpicking, in the sense that if the things we tend to focus on these days are all we have to complain about then we’re in a very fortunate stage of the smartphone evolution. It wasn’t that long ago that the vast majority of smartphones produced potato camera results, that a mid-afternoon recharge was essential for making it to dinner time, or that getting caught in the rain would mean the end for anything but an Xperia device. See also: Best Android phones 3 weeks ago But with phones being so good across the board now, companies seem to think that increasingly banal “features” are suddenly newsworthy items of interest. For example, OnePlus did its typical hypebeasting this week, all in the name of introducing a limited edition new color for the OnePlus 3T. Black. A black smartphone. Wow, whoever woulda thunk it? Again: color choices are table stakes options, not something special. The Collette edition OP3T is exactly the same as a regular 3T, except it’s black and it has Collette’s logo branded on the back. Forgive me if I’m unlikely to line up in the streets of Paris to try my luck at buying a black smartphone. Forgive me if I'm unlikely to line up in the streets of Paris to try my luck at buying a black smartphone. Now, I don’t blame OnePlus for advertising a new limited edition phone, even if it isn’t exactly exciting. But where most companies would have simply announced the new color on their Facebook page, OnePlus went through the effort of teasing an announcement and then counting down the days to the big reveal: of a very standard color in extremely limited edition that’s only available at one store in one city in Europe for one day. Suffice it to say, OnePlus’ fans were not very impressed. And nor should they be. Of course, OnePlus never claimed they were doing anything revolutionary, and if the limited edition color was anything other than black then perhaps the backlash wouldn’t be quite so palpable. The issue I have is that OnePlus tried to hype something as bland as a black color option as something of importance. It’s the same problem I have with OEMs making a big deal of the headphone port. These things are not a big deal, people, so stop acting as if they are. I'm sure we're going to see more of the status quo being sold as something significant in the years to come. Unfortunately, I’m sure we’re going to see more of the status quo being sold as something significant in the years to come. As the IR blaster disappears, as physical buttons become virtual and so on. You don’t get to hype the past. No car manufacturer makes a big deal of the fact their new vehicle has four wheels and a combustion engine. These things are a given. What we want to see hyped is what’s new, what’s fresh and what hasn’t been done for years before. But as consumers demonstrate they’re not into goofy gimmicks like LG’s modularity and that a solid, capable smartphone is what they truly want, it’s going to be increasingly hard for companies to hype new features. We as consumers seem to be willing to become beta testers for updates and quality assurance testers for new products that creep ever closer to the $1000 mark, so can we really blame OEMs for trying to hype yesterday’s facts as features? Probably not, but we should really learn not to fall for it. Features News Kris Carlon Kris Carlon is a Senior Editor at Android Authority.

(This was after she’d written the company an open letter admonishing it to pay musicians better royalties, something that led to an Apple policy change.) But now it looks like Swift might want to have an even bigger impact on the whole streaming-service landscape. It looks like she’s trying to launch a streaming service of her own. TMZ reports that Swift has filed documents to form a website “featuring non-downloadable multi-media content in the nature of audio recordings.” She apparently wants to call it Swifties, which is a really terrible name. She’s also planning to launch a line of musical equipment — including guitars, guitar straps, guitar picks, and drumsticks — as well as a series of retreats, educational camps, and online courses. The last time a country-pop superstar tried to develop his own streaming service, it was Garth Brooks with GhostTunes. Brooks launched GhostTunes in 2014, and it has already failed. Just saying. UPDATE: Well, whatever Swift has in mind for Swifties, it’s not gonna be a streaming service. As Billboard’s Dan Rys reports: [A] source confirmed to Billboard that she would not be launching a streaming service, and a closer look at the trademarks reveals a different, more probable, angle for the singer. What’s that angle, you ask? [Swifites] looks like a personalized fan club app complete with exclusive merchandise, audio/video/live performances and the possibility of a mobile game of some sort is on the horizon for Swift’s fans, rather than any kind of large-scale streaming service. Huh. So … OK. That seems a whole lot more viable (if waaaay less interesting) than a Taylor Swift-branded streaming service. Rys goes into pretty extensive detail in his analysis of the trademarks in question, and you can (and should) read the whole thing over at Billboard.

By David Snelling PUBLISHED: 07:38, Sun, Mar 19, 2017 | UPDATED: 07:39, Sun, Mar 19, 2017 If previous years are anything to go by, Apple will release its all-new iPhone 8 in September. This latest device could see some major changes with Apple expected to produce something special to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the iPhone. Apple co-founder, Steve Jobs, unveiled the company’s first ever smartphone in January 2007 and the US technology giant has since gone on to sell over one billion iPhones across the world. We’re expecting to see all the usual upgrades on the new iPhone 8 including faster processor, improved camera and better battery life. However, a new report from KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo and Chinese research firm TrendForce suggest that the iPhone 8 will almost certainly have a feature that’s never been seen on an Apple smartphone before - a curved display. GETTYApple iPhone 8 could get this new feature Apple iPhone 8 - Leaked photos, concept images, and renders Sun, January 1, 2017 iPhone 8 is shaping up to be one of the most impressive Apple smartphones to date, with glass panels on the front and rear of the device, a curved borderless OLED display and no Home Button Play slideshow VENIAMIN GESKIN • TWITTER • CONCEPT IMAGES 1 of 21 Apple iPhone 8 will debut a brand-new all-glass look, with a curved OLED display and no physical Home Button There’s already been plenty of reports that Apple is planning to introduce an AMOLED screen on its new iPhone but this latest rumour now suggests it will curve subtly around the edge of the device. Arch-rival Samsung has been bending their screens for a number of years and the Galaxy S8, which launches on March 29th, is expected to take this technology to new level with a screen that will cover almost the entire front of the phone. It’s thought Apple won’t copy Samsung’s full curve but instead gently push the display around the edges of the case. Apple Chief Design Officer Jony Ive is reportedly designing the phone so that it resembles "a single sheet of glass". Apple is hotly-tipped to ditch the physical Home Button from the front of the smartphone, so that it can reduce the bezels around the display. But the dramatic changes planned for the next iPhone will not just be surface-deep. According to a new research note from UBS, Apple has put together a team of more than 1,000 engineers working on Augmented Reality (AR) technology ready for the iPhone. REDDIT • FLOCKMANN • CONCEPTSiPHONEThe iPhone 8 could feature a curved display Alongside the iPhone 8, Apple is also thought to be planning to launch an iPhone 7s and 7s Plus. These devices could include small updates over Apple’s current lineup and are likely to be cheaper than flagship iPhone 8. If September seems a long time to wait for a new iPhone there could be some good news coming sooner. Rumours are suggesting Apple is planning a Spring event which could see the company refresh the iPhone SE and introduce some new iPads. Apple has debuted new products in March four times in the last six years. Some sources have said that Apple will remove the Home Button from its new iPad range. This will allow the Cupertino company to dramatically reduce the size of the bezels around the display, except for the bezel along the top of the device, which contains the FaceTime camera and is said to remain.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Opinions There’s never going to be an iPhone killer Image Source: Vianney le Masne Yoni Heisler @edibleapple March 17th, 2017 at 12:28 PM Share Tweet Per usual, Apple finds itself in the crosshairs of armchair critics who lazily demand that Apple needs to come up with the next big thing lest it enter a period of stagnation. All the while, other tech companies never seem to grapple with similar demands from analysts and pundits. Whereas Apple needs to outdo the iPhone, we never hear calls for Facebook to come up with a social network killer or for Google to come up with a product that will obsolete the search engine. Don't Miss: Leak shows a stunning Galaxy S8 in a stolen Jet Black finish The iPhone’s 10th anniversary earlier this year sparked a number of opinion pieces proclaiming that the iPhone has peaked and that it’s time for Apple to deliver an iPhone killer, a futuristic device that will obsolete the iPhone in the same way that Apple’s iconic smartphone quickly rendered the iPod outdated. Writing for Wired, Davey Alba opined that the iPhone — of all things — is actually slowing Apple down and that the company must figure out what’s next. Now Apple is facing a turning point, and once again the iPhone is the reason—but not in a good way this time around. The smartphone market is saturated. Rivals, especially Google, are building hardware that truly rivals the iPhone. After 10 years, the iPhone can no longer serve as Apple’s growth engine. The company now faces the same challenge it did a decade ago: figuring out what’s next. It’s not an unfair point, but it conveniently overlooks the fact that Apple has become rather adept at extracting more dollars from existing iPhone owners via its burgeoning suite of services. Whether it’s the App Store — which recorded its most profitable day in company history not too long ago — or the growing popularity of Apple Music, Apple has figured out a few ways to pad its bottom line even as iPhone sales growth did an about-face this past year. Meanwhile, a piece in Forbes from earlier this year took an even bolder position, arguing that Apple must build an iPhone killer. Which means it’s time for Apple to kill the iPhone…not in one fell swoop, of course, and not as the intended goal… No matter how innovative your product or service once was, sticking to incrementalism in order to most efficiency milk the maximum amount of revenue out of it is a losing proposition. As your incremental change curve flattens out, the development that will [obsolete you] will be disappearing in your windshield before… you ever noticed it approaching in your rear-view mirror. It’s time for Apple to build the iPhone killer. The only problem is that doing so is impossible. The original iPhone was a revolutionary device that quickly transformed the smartphone into an indispensable part of the way we live. And because its functionality is wildly expansive and limited only by the imagination of third-party developers, it’s utility isn’t artificially stunted in the way that the iPod’s was. The smartphone in general, and the iPhone in particular, isn’t going anywhere because it functions as a portal of sorts; its utility is always expanding as its hardware improves and new software is developed. Looking ahead, for example, the upcoming iPhone 8 is said to feature advanced augmented reality functionality that may very well transform the way we use our smartphones. The fact of the matter is that some products become so entrenched in our everyday lives that the notion of killing them off simply isn’t realistic. Notice how we never hear calls for anyone to develop a TV killer or for Google to develop search engine killer. Truly revolutionary products and technologies have extremely long shelf lives that can’t be obsoleted on an arbitrary time frame. The iPod’s demise at the hands of the iPhone was an exception, not the rule. Put simply, the iPhone isn’t going anywhere no matter what type of product area Apple opts to enter. Curiously, some people have even argued that a more advanced version of the Apple Watch might eventually replace the iPhone. These claims, I believe, completely overlook the fact that a big and easily accessible smartphone display can never be replaced by even the most intuitive software on a watch or a pair of AR glasses. Point being, there’s never going to be an iPhone killer, only new and advanced iPhones that render previous models obsolete. Having said that, Apple still doesn’t seem to get the credit it deserves for continually rolling out, with absolutely no aberration, impressive advances in iPhone technology year after year. From huge leaps in hardware performance to incredible improvements in camera technology, Apple has managed to steadily and substantially improve the iPhone user experience every single year for 9 years running. And with the iPhone 8 looming on the horizon, the next leap in performance and design may be the biggest one yet. Just last quarter, Apple posted a new quarterly record for iPhone sales.

The illustration of Apple's lengthy legal agreement is done by R. Sikoryak, an animator, illustrator, and cartoonist living in New York. The visuals are inspired by 59 different comics. For his newest project, R. Sikoryak tackles the monstrously and infamously dense legal document, iTunes Terms and Conditions, the contract everyone agrees to but no one reads. In a word for word 94-page adaptation, Sikoryak hilariously turns the agreement on its head―each page features an avatar of Apple cofounder and legendary visionary Steve Jobs juxtaposed with a different classic strip such as Mort Walker’s Beatle Bailey, or a contemporary graphic novel such as Craig Thompson’s Blankets or Marjane Satrapi’s Persepolis. Adapting the legalese of the iTunes Terms and Conditions into another medium seems like an unfathomable undertaking, yet Sikoryak creates a surprisingly readable document, far different from its original, purely textual incarnation and thus proving the accessibility and flexibility of comics. When Sikoryak parodies Kate Beaton’s Hark A Vagrant peasant comics with Steve Jobs discussing objectionable material or Homer Simpson as Steve Jobs warning of the penalties of copyright infringement, Terms and Conditions serves as a surreal record of our modern digital age where technology competes with enduringly ironclad mediums. You can purchase 'Terms and Conditions' from the link below for $10.36. Read More Follow iClarified Comments (1) Add Comment D4xM4Nx - March 19, 2017 at 5:57am Oh man...

One of the devices will be branded the iPhone 8, with the other two possibly attracting the iPhone 7S moniker. Thus, we will likely see an iPhone 8 released alongside iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus devices. Sales positive TrendForce also suggested that iPhone sales will pick up significantly in 2017, and that the calendar year could be something of a landmark one for the Californian corporation. Apple hasn’t exactly struggled over the last 18 months, but its sales have slowed down slightly as the smartphone niche begins to recede somewhat. It has been suggested by numerous publications that we may already have reached ‘peak smartphone’, and the big players in this niche must now demonstrate that they can reinvigorate the public imagination. FunkyFocus / Pixabay But the opinion of TrendForce has been backed up by a major investment bank Morgan Stanley. Kate Huberty, an analyst at the corporation, suggests that demand for the iPhone 8 has been grossly underestimated, predicting an upsurge in sales of approximately 20 per cent for 2018. This would be a massive improvement for the Cupertino-based company, and one which would undoubtedly see the iPhone get back on track. “We do not think the super cycle is fully appreciated,” Huberty told CNBC PRO. “What we expect in September is a phone that has significant advancements in technology: OLED screens, 3-D sensors, wireless charging [and] likely some more advanced software in the area of artificial intelligence.” 100 million units In order to meet this demand, TrendForce suggests that Apple will produce 100 million iPhone 8 units; a massive figure even by the prolific standards of Apple. However, this initial production run will account for less than 50 per cent of total iPhone sales during the fiscal year, with the analyst expecting Apple to shift in the region of 230 million iPhones throughout the fiscal period. This would represent a 6 per cent increase on 2016, and would almost certainly have a positive impact on the Apple stock price. OLED expected TrendForce also suggests that Apple will indeed embrace OLED technology with the iPhone 8, something that has become almost a cliché in tech circles. Clearly preparations have been made for the move from LCD to OLED at Apple, and the analyst report suggests that Apple will indeed include OLED in the iPhone 8 generation. It is also suggested that the iPhone 8 display will be increased somewhat over previous releases, with a 5.8-inch screen linked with the device according to TrendForce. However, this screen will not result in a larger handset, as the slimming down of bezels and removal of the Home button on the iPhone 8 will allow a similar sized chassis to previous releases. TrendForce also suggests that the display of the iPhone 8 will be based on 2K resolution, with a display ratio that is likely to exceed 2:1. The panel will also feature a slight curve, although TrendForce believes that this will not be as pronounced as in some of the Samsung handsets. Samsung has practically made its reputation on curved screen displays in recent years, but analysts believe that Apple will not entirely follow suit with the iPhone 8, but will still go its own way while also introducing some form of curved technology for the first time. “The curve will be gentler than screens in Samsung’s Galaxy S7 Edge handsets. This is partly due to the challenges of making curved glass covers to match screens, according to the source,” Nikkei’s Debby Wu suggested. “While the curved screen will allow a viewable area of about 5.2 inches and make the iPhone even sleeker, it will not offer significant new functions”. $1,000 smartphone However, the inclusion of an OLED panel could have an impact on the price tag of the iPhone 8, as the technology costs significantly more than the LCD that the iPhone has been based on previously. Reports this week have suggested that the OLED panel will cost Apple significantly more than the display included in the iPhone 7, and that this expense will have to be passed on to the consumer. And with other components also expected to increase the price tag of the device, the consensus of opinion among analysts is that consumers can expect to pay in excess of $1,000 for this next generation Apple handset. Camera tech KGI Securities analyst Ming-chi Kuo, probably the most renowned analyst anywhere within the mobile sphere, has also opened up on the camera technology that he believes will form part of the iPhone 8 armory. Central to this will be a revolutionary front camera setup, which will incorporate a 3D sensor intended to deliver several new features. The sensor will reportedly work in tandem with 2D images produced by the camera to create what are described as unique 3D selfies. What this precisely represents is not entirely clear, but there will obviously be a strong sharing aspect to this technology. Reports have previously suggested that Apple will particularly embrace augmented technology in the forthcoming Apple generation, but it seems to also have an eye on some unique 3D features. Facial recognition It is believed that the technology will also play a major role in the facial recognition features included in the iPhone 8, which will only strengthen the rumors that Apple will replace and / or supplement the TouchID functionality included in the iPhone series. Facial recognition could be used in order to unlock the smartphone, deliver remote payments and make purchases via Apple Pay. Apple already owns Israeli tech firm RealFace, meaning that the mega-corporation is well placed to deliver this technology in the iPhone 8 generation. Sensors utilized by the new camera will be able to perform depth of field calculations using a dedicated infrared transmitter and receiver, according to reports. Sony and Foxconn are both expected to get involved with this technology, and its inclusion could enable Apple to significantly update the dual-camera system included in the iPhone 7 Plus. UPDATE: 03-10-2017: There is some stark new news about the iPhone 8…it might not even exist! Recent reports suggest that the next generation smartphone from Apple, likely to launch in September, may not feature the iPhone 8 moniker that has been widely anticipated. iPhone Edition A new report from the highly regarded Japanese blog Mac Otakara suggests that Apple will instead brand the tenth generation of the iPhone as the iPhone Edition. This name would seemingly signify that the new smartphone is a top-of-the-range device, in accordance with the approach taken previously with the Apple Watch Edition. Image: Sheeraz Raza, ValueWalk The prestigious smartwatch cost in excess of $10,000, and while the Apple Watch Edition would obviously not be so highly priced, it has already been suggested that it could retail at a price point in excess of $1,000. Apple may also produce accompanying versions of the smartphone, which would then be branded differently.

With the Apple Watch, it's available right from your wrist. Updated March 2017: Added Siri updates for watchOS 3.2. Siri uses your voice to activate and answer queries. As such, it doesn't require a keyboard or a ton of screen space. And because it's contextually aware, it can handle complex questions and commands. That makes it ideal for something like the Apple Watch, where it can often work faster and more conveniently than any other input method. How to set up Siri on Apple Watch How to use Siri on Apple Watch How to quickly and reliably trigger Siri Everything Siri can do on your Apple Watch How to use Handoff to switch from Siri on your Apple Watch to your iPhone How to set up Siri on Apple Watch Siri on Apple Watch is intrinsically tied to your iPhone: If you've ever turned Siri on for your iPhone, it'll automatically be activated on your Apple Watch. If you need to enable Siri, however, here's how to do it. Open the Settings app on your iPhone. Go to the Siri setting. Tap the On/Off slider to enable Siri for iPhone and Apple Watch. How to use Siri on Apple Watch There are two ways to use Siri: via the automatic "Hey Siri" command, or manually by pressing the Digital Crown. Whatever way you use to activate Siri, keep in mind that everything is processed via your iPhone: If you don't have a strong cellular or Wi-Fi connection, your Apple Watch will be unable to process your command. If you're on cellular, Siri may also take a few moments to process properly; after speaking, Siri may prompt you with a quick "Hang on..." before getting your query. During this time, you can let your arm drop back to its normal position — your watch will tap you on the wrist when Siri has finished processing. Unlike Siri on your iPhone, your Apple Watch is always silent when talking with you — you'll only see text in response to a query. How to use "Hey Siri" on your Apple Watch Raise your Apple Watch to your face (or, if you have wrist raise disabled, tap on the screen to wake your watch). Say Hey, Siri followed by your query. Note: Hey Siri will only activate in the first few seconds that your Apple Watch screen is on — if you're not getting it to work, keep this in mind! How to manually activate Siri on your Apple Watch Press and hold the Digital Crown. State your question or command to Siri. How to quickly and reliably trigger Siri Thanks to room noise and other external factors, Siri doesn't always trigger reliably on the watch. Here are a few tips I've found for getting Siri to work more reliably—and not cut you off mid-sentence. 1. Force Siri to listen by keeping the Digital Crown pressed down This trick completely changed my Siri usage for the better: While not required, I recommend continuing to hold the Digital Crown in while speaking your query, to make sure Siri understands your full statement. (This is especially helpful in noisy environments, where Siri doesn't always know when you're finished speaking.) 2. Make "Hey Siri" work more reliably with screen taps To save battery, the Apple Watch only listens for the "Hey Siri" on screen wake. Unfortunately, that can make "Hey Siri" a little frustrating if you have your screen configured to wake on wrist raise and don't get the phrase out quickly enough. Instead, you can reset the process by briefly putting your palm over the screen to turn it off, then re-raising your wrist (or pressing on the display) to wake it, followed by "Hey Siri." 3. Wear your Watch with the microphone facing out Having trouble getting Siri to understand you? You may want to try Craig Hockenberry's "Reverse Crown" orientation with your Apple Watch. This keeps the watch on your left wrist, but flips the digital crown to the lower left side. It also moves the microphone and speaker to the right side, getting them closer to your voice when you raise your wrist. (In colder climates, this also frees the speaker from being buried under layers of clothing.) Everything Siri can do on your Apple Watch Watch Siri may not be quite as full-featured as iPhone Siri, but your digital assistant can still do a bunch of tasks — and chat with its iPhone buddy when otherwise at a loss. Here's a quick overview of what Siri can (and can't) do on the Apple Watch. Everything Siri can do on your Apple Watch How to use Handoff to switch from Siri on your Apple Watch to your iPhone Handoff lets you start an action on one device and finish it on another. It is compatible with the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and... Apple Watch! There are some things that Apple Watch just can't do, given its small screen. But if you ask Siri, it won't give up. Instead, it will redirect you to your iPhone and "automagically" transfer your request. You can quickly enable Handoff for your Apple Watch from the Watch app on your iPhone, if it's not already set up. On your iPhone, open the Watch app. Select the My Watch tab. Tap General. Scroll down to the Enable Handoff section and tap the switch to enable the feature. Once this is enabled, you'll be able to use Siri on your Apple Watch to ask for just about anything. If it's not a task the Apple Watch can handle, Siri will automatically offer to switch you over to your iPhone. Questions? Let us know in the comments.

Editorial Director at Mobile Nations, analyst at iMore, video and podcast host, you can follow him @reneritchie on Snapchat, Instagram, and Twitter. If Dell can make the Dell Precision 5520, why can't Apple make a MacBook that's really Pro? That's the hed and lede that flashed through my mind after I read Daniel Rubino's review of the Dell Precision 5520 for Windows Central: Dell's powerful 15-inch Precision 5520 now has the latest Intel Xeon processor and NVIDIA Quadro graphics. This bulldozer of a PC with a 4K display may be your best bet if you're a graphics professional. Now, current Rene loves the 2016 MacBook Pro. I've been using the 13-inch Touchbar model since October and it's the best MacBook I've ever owned. I used to go back and forth between the 13-inch MacBook Air and old 13-inch MacBook Pro every couple of years, never able to find the right trade-off between portability and performance. Now I truly have the best of both. But that's just me. Past Rene worked in video and webdev and graphic design and wouldn't have been such a fan. He bought 17-inch, later 15-inch, and maxed them out. Current Rene spends most of his time in browsers, with some light Photoshop and Final Cut Pro thrown in for events and special projects. And all of that is fine on the new MacBook Pro. More than fine, considering I've been using the 8 GB Core i5 model and keep forgetting that's what it is. (I'm used to maxing out every Mac — this is new and weird for me.) I represent the growing, more mainstream "pro" market Apple's been targeting lately, rather than the traditional, higher-end market that historically supported the Mac. Some label it "pro-sumer" but it's more a reflection that value has come to derive not from speeds and feeds but from multiple vectors, including social. It's a market of millions, not thousands. That's hurt the traditional, higher-end pro, though. At least those who prefer Macs. They currently feel abandoned, like they stuck with Apple when Apple was doomed and, now that Apple is successful, they're being dumped for a younger, hotter new market. It's a sentiment that's been building each and every year the Mac Pro hasn't been updated. It surged late last year, though, when Apple introduced a bare-bones new MacBook Pro without a Touch Bar at the low-end for people who wanted a Retina MacBook Air, but didn't introduce an equal and opposite souped-up model on the high-end for people who wanted a workstation, only mobile. Now, tech graveyards are littered with the shattered relevance of analysts who claimed Apple simply had to ship netbooks or servers or mini-towers or licensed OS. Ignoring just exactly those kinds of myopic ravings has led to Apple being phenomenally successful. Far more than companies that netbooked their margins and themselves almost out of business. So, I'm not going to stand here and say Apple has to ship a higher-end MacBook Pro. Clearly, they don't, not any more than they have to ship Xserve or Aperture. For Apple, I imagine most of the "pro" market is more like me now. Perhaps even closer to the MacBook Pro "escape" and further from the Dell Precision 5520. If you listen to Twitter, the hardcore Apple community wants desktop-class Kaby Lake and Nvidia 1080 in their MacBooks, with 64 GB of RAM, hold the floppy. If you look at how Apple's customers vote with their wallets, though, the answer is profoundly different. Likewise, influencers. If I had to guess, people who buy Mac Pro have far less impact on growing the market these days than people who sit in coffee shops working on MacBooks. Apple is chasing that puck where it's going to be as well. It's why I think Apple's just isn't as worried about the horn effect as some others might be, including me. Apple can get it wrong and misread the market, of course. They walked back the buttonless iPod shuffle, fatty nano, and even G4 Cube. Mac Pro also taught Apple not to innovate what they can't rapidly iterate. That's what happens when you're audacious, though. Change comes with risk. So, while every instinct in my lower writer's brain wanted to pound away on the hed and lede above, wanted to say Apple should "screw the ROI" and make a higher-end MacBook Pro anyway, the more I wrote the less likely that possibility started to seem. Current Rene is fine with that because it doesn't really impact him. Everyone thinks Apple should do less and focus more — as long as it's someone else's favorite products and product lines that pay the price. That's why past Rene wants to tell current Rene to stuff it, and is still hoping to see a great MacBook Pro workstation... at least one more time.

One that appeals to their core VOCAL users. They may not line up in the coffee shops but they get online and post all day long. The other important group is developers/creatives. Without these guys, gone are the days of unique mac programs, compelling mac programs, ones that make you want to switch and even more importantly, iOS apps. Of course, a separate issue is if anyone outside a very few can make a viable living selling software. I guarantee you Rene, if Apple put together the very best 17" MBP they could think of and even if the price made your nose bleed, you'd be interested. I would. Be honest now..lol This is all interesting stuff of course. I do feel like Macs are the heart of Apple. Certainly not the bread winner but they're what make bringing in the bread possible. For me, MacOS (previously windows) is what drives everything, while mobile is an extension or compliment of it. Without that Mac, I wouldn't find iOS as compelling. Along that line, I wouldn't mind seeing Apple make more hardware. Airpods made me smile as I do each time i use them. But do more of this. They made USB-C standard, so make stuff for it. I gave Sony thousands for their mirrorless camera system. It's UI kinda sucks though. I got a logitech harmony (this is input 1 i have argued) I paid nearly 300 for. Too bad it's not based on iOS. Someone make me a printer without a crappy UI. How is Apple not selling wireless speakers with W1 chip? You got to sell monitors Apple. Just some examples but all of which enrich an ecosystem. PS..cheers for the article. These are the kind I like on iMore. 2 3 days ago Reply emjayess "Someone make me a printer without a crappy UI." God, yes! Couldn't agree more!

It prints fast and efficiently, but the UI absolutely sucks--like something you'd see on a computer in the 90s. 0 3 days ago Reply Steve Doherty Just a thought.. Given Apple are obviously not going to give the segment of users who are clamouring for super high end hardware what they want, wouldn't it make sense to allow macOS to be licensed and capable of running on non Apple sanctioned hardware? This gives users the best of both worlds (stability of staying with 'official' hardware, as well as the flexibilty of hardware that power users want) and stops the grumbling from the 'Pro' users who feel disenfranchised. I know this was tried in the dark days of the 90s and was an epic fail, but the landscape is different now. I'll be looking at upgrading when they ship a 2017 iMac, but if it ships with a mid-range GPU as a top end option, I'm going back to Windows. 0 3 days ago Reply DannyJJK I can't see Apple doing this though, one of Apple's main selling points for their computers is the fact that it runs macOS 0 3 days ago Reply C6TX6 Most consumer equipment that is labeled "pro" or "professional" isn't. ;) I have a Dell XPS 9550 fully maxed out as well as a 2016 MBP fully maxed out as well. They're both similar. I do like the display on the Dell better. The keyboard and trackpad on the MBP (of course) are far superior. The Dell was still cheaper even when upgraded to 32GB DDR4-2400 and a Samsung 960 Pro 2TB PCI-E SSD. Battery life on both is similar. The 9560 with Kaby Lake was released in Jan. I really hope it doesn't have the issues that plagued the 9500 in its early stages. I think it's hilarious how many people are making a big deal about pro or non pro users. I deal with professional musicians, engineers, CEOs, scientists, professionals in politics and law (yes I said it!) and there are quite a few of those folks running sub par hardware and just refuse to spend serious money on a computer. I'm the type if I have to wait for my computer to do anything (aside from rendering or other projects that take time) I'm huffing and wanting to throw it out the window. Regardless of what you have, the SSD is truly the best thing since sliced bread. 1 3 days ago Reply mavsguy842 I see Apple making monitors and really high-end laptops and desktops as halo products more than products they want to make money with. It's a common tactic to get people interested with your super high end product, and almost all of them end up purchasing one of your high end or mid-range products instead because they really don't NEED (and probably can't afford) the super high end. Without those halo products the brand starts to lose its luster. 0 3 days ago Reply returnmyjedi "Screw the ROI" Not a very nice thing to say to the Republic of Ireland, and on St Patrick's day as well! 3 3 days ago Reply VAVA Mk2 +1 Posted via the iMore App for Android 1 3 days ago Reply PoisonMaps I agree with Rene. There is a subset of users who cannot do what they need on Apple’s current laptop range purely because the available hardware is not powerful enough (mainly due to RAM or graphics considerations). Even if there aren’t enough such users for Apple to bother with a high-spec laptop for purely financial reasons, there are plenty of other reasons why it is worth their while. When people are reluctantly leaving Apple’s ecosystem because their products aren’t powerful enough then that sort of bad PR must affect sales on the rest of the range. 1 3 days ago Reply Moodyz The prices of their current 'mainstream' pro (weasel term for pseudo-pro, me thinks) models like the 15" TouchBar MBP are already insane enough. Can't imagine how much a real pro machine from them would cost, and that's before adding a couple of hundred quid for the bloody dongles. 0 3 days ago Reply moooooooo totally agree. The new MBP with touchbar same spec as my 2014 RMBP is $NZ4600 (plus all the dongles i'll need) - thats a ton of money given i paid $NZ3200 for the same spec'd model in January 2015 sans touchbar. I cant justify a new MBP at those prices. I'm hoping they release an i7 Mac Mini soon as thats the only new Mac that i'd potentially look at right now. 0 3 days ago Reply dianeincincinnati The main reason Apple will no longer build REAL Pro devices: Jony Ive values form and discounts function.

Digital Trends Home > Mobile > Apple patent filing suggests AirPods could one day… Apple patent filing suggests AirPods could one day help track your fitness By Christian de Looper — March 16, 2017 11:35 AM Subscribe Share Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you If you want to keep better tabs on your health and fitness, you're set to get more and more devices that can help you do so. Apple is putting more and more of a focus on fitness tracking, and that’s unlikely to change anytime soon. While the Apple Watch will continue to get better at tracking your health and fitness, it looks like Apple could soon use another device for tracking — AirPods. A new patent application has been discovered by the folks over at AppleInsider, and it shows that Apple may be working on a pair of AirPods packed with sensors that will allow them to track your health and fitness — on top of obviously functioning like a pair of headphones. More: Apple’s Find My AirPods feature makes it nearly impossible to lose your ‘buds Sensors that are listed in the filing include a PPG sensor, which is already used in the Apple Watch and is a common way to track heart rate by shining a light onto the skin and measuring the variations in reflections. That tech can also be used to characterize the blood. The patent application also mentions the use of a VO2 sensor, which detects the maximum amount of oxygen someone can use during exercise. Not only that, but it also notes an EKG sensor and ICG sensor could be used to detect the electrical activity of the heart. The news highlights a trend that sees tech companies taking more and more of an interest in health and fitness tracking. Wearable devices are increasingly fitness focused, and whether Apple uses AirPods for fitness tracking or not, that trend is likely to continue. AirPods themselves were first launched at the end of 2016, and have met with quite a bit of success, to the point where the availability of AirPods has been limited since the launch. It will be interesting to see if Apple intends to integrate biometric sensors into AirPods. If the company does, it could help make them even more popular than they already are.

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady Rumor: Signs of fifth-gen Apple TV noted in developer logs, new unit thought to feature faster processor, 4K streaming support Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Friday, March 17th, 2017, 05:31 Category: Apple TV, Hardware, Rumor The first network traffic from what seems to be a fifth-generation Apple TV capable of streaming 4K video has been captured in developer logs. The device is said to be codenamed “J105” and could launch as soon as this year. Firi Games, the developers behind arcade games Phoenix HD and Phoenix II, stated they have seen a single device identified as “AppleTV6,2” and running “tvOS 11.0” connect to Phoenix HD for Apple TV from the United States in its logs. The IP address falls within a range linked to Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino. The current Apple TV has a model identifier of AppleTV5,3, and Apple TV6,2 does not correspond with any released model. While this should be taken with a grain of salt, as details can be faked, similar evidence of an iPhone 5s running iOS 7 showed up in January 2013, around nine months before the device was announced. If Apple is following its past history, this could indicate a new Apple TV, as the current generation unit launched in October 2015. No other details about a fifth-generation Apple TV device have been confirmed. In December 2015, it was rumored that the next-generation Apple TV would feature a new CPU with dramatically improved performance. Last quarter, Apple financial chief Luca Maestri stated that the Apple TV remains something of a hobby for Apple, which reportedly shelved its rumored streaming TV service and only has its “toe in the water” with original content. Stay tuned for additional details as they become available.

Microsoft Loves iPhones: OneDrive App Updated with iMessage Support GO New OneDrive version released this morning Mar 18, 2017 12:51 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  Say what you want about Microsoft’s mobile efforts, but you can’t blame the company for not being committed to smartphones. The only problem here is that Microsoft is committed to a mobile platform that it doesn’t own, leaving its own Windows phones well behind competition. Today, the software giant has released another important update for iPhone users that provides them with quicker access to files stored in the cloud. The latest version of OneDrive for iOS, which has reached 8.11.5, comes with support for Apple’s iMessage, the messaging solution that’s exclusively available for users in Cupertino’s ecosystem. With this update, OneDrive becomes available for iMessage users straight in the ongoing conversation, making it possible to connect to their Microsoft cloud accounts, select files, and share them on the go. It all takes just a few seconds and sharing files and folders stored in OneDrive doesn’t require anything else than a few taps within iMessage. Apple’s iMessage Apple is betting big on iMessage, as the latest version of iOS brought some big updates for the app which expand its messaging capabilities with new emoji and support for add-ons, such as GIF apps that make it possible to include animated pics in conversations. iMessage, however, remains an iOS-exclusive solution, and even though there were rumors that Apple wanted to bring it on Android, it’s hard to believe that such a thing would happen. Microsoft has apparently noticed the iMessage opportunity, so the company is trying to make its solutions available at one-tap distance right in the messaging app. Most likely, OneDrive is just the beginning, with other apps likely to get iMessage integration in the coming weeks and months. For what it’s worth, OneDrive requires iOS 9 or later and can be installed on iPhones, iPads, and iPod touch, obviously without paying a single cent. The app does come with in-app purchases and makes it possible to get subscriptions for other Microsoft products, including Office 365. #Microsoft#OneDrive#iPhone#iMessage subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Windows XP Installed on an iPhone 7 Because Why Not - Video Give Up on an iPhone 7 or Samsung Galaxy S7 for This Windows Phone and Get $600 Microsoft’s Surface Phone Could Launch in 2019 as iPhone 9 Rival - Rumors Microsoft vs. Apple, Round 2: New iPad Pro in the Works As Surface Keeps Growing Windows 10 Cumulative Update KB4015438 Also Taking Ages to Install Microsoft Releases Windows 10 Build 15063 for PC and Mobile YouTube on Restricted Mode Blocking LGBTQ+ Content: Our System Is Flawed 7 Tips to Stay Safe from Attacks like the Fappening New Instagram Update Allows Users to Save Live Videos Dutch Police Buys Unnecessary Microsoft Office Licenses by Mistake… Twice Google Releases Android 7.1.2 Nougat Beta 2 for Nexus and Pixel Windows 10 Cumulative Update KB4015438 Also Taking Ages to Install    OneDrive integrated in iMessage New Apps Web Log Suite Enterprise Edition: Generate reports from the raw log files from your website that you can analyze in depth to determine the number of visitors using this app Irida: Compose messages on your PC and send them to various contacts using an Android phone connected to the same network, with this nifty application Windows Repair Toolbox: Conveniently diagnose and repair broken processes on your operating system to improve its overall responsiveness and performance ID Photo Maker: Create ID photos by cropping pictures and generating easy-to-cut printable layouts, with this lightweight, straightforward utility Web Log Suite Professional Edition: Analyze all sorts of log files (e.g. Apache Extended, Apache Common, Microsoft IIS W3C Extended, Microsoft IIS NCSA Common) and generate detailed reports Windows Repair Toolbox Portable: Identify and repair multiple broken processes, create backups for your data and uninstall programs you no longer use via this utility Coolmuster Android SMS+Contacts Recovery: Recover the SMS messages and contact list from a rooted Android device that you damaged, got infected, stolen or lost with software solution Reader comments HP Launches EliteOne 800 AIO PC with Intel Core i7, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD Storage more on: HP i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Samsung has done the impossible with the Galaxy S8 Image Source: Benjamin Geskin Zach Epstein @zacharye March 17th, 2017 at 9:41 AM Share Tweet In the smartphone market, Samsung found success not by differentiating and carving its own path, but by taking a page out of Apple’s playbook. Or should we say, 132 pages. Apple turned the cell phone industry on its head in 2007 when it released the original iPhone. There was certainly no better company to model its devices and strategy after, and Samsung’s sales skyrocketed once it began retooling its devices to look and function more like Apple’s smartphones and tablets. Samsung still takes pages out of the Apple playbook from time to time — case in point — but it has truly elevated its game in recent years, with several recent generations of flagship phones that contend with the iPhone on every level. There is one are where Samsung flagships have never managed to compete with iPhones, but it looks like that will change with the upcoming new Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+. Don't Miss: There’s a mysterious new Google phone in the works and it isn’t the Pixel 2 or Pixel 2 XL In just a week and a half, Samsung will unveil its next-generation flagship smartphones at a press conference in New York City. The wait has felt like an eternity considering how long Galaxy S8 details have been leaking. We know almost everything there is to know about the S8 and S8+, including exactly what they look like and when they’ll be released. And now, we know how remarkably powerful these hot new handsets are going to be. Each year when Samsung launches new Galaxy S phones, they’re instantly become the most powerful widely available Android phones in the world. Note the inclusion of the word “Android,” however. Samsung’s phones are never the most powerful phones, period, because they simply can’t measure up to iPhones in terms of power. Apple’s in-house chips and its silky smooth iOS software reign supreme each and every year until the next new iPhones are released. This year, however, it looks like things will be different. Two separate Geekbench 4 benchmark test results for the unreleased Galaxy S8 smartphone appeared on the Primate Labs website on Thursday night. Long story short, they’re very impressive. The S8 managed single-core scores of 1913 and 1978 in the two tests, and the multi-core scores came in at 6119 and 6375. Both sets of test results come from the international version of the Galaxy S8, which is powered by Samsung’s own Exynos 8895 processor, though earlier test results showed similar performance from the US version of the Galaxy S8+, which is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 chipset. In terms of single-core performance, the Galaxy S8 doesn’t even come close to touching Apple’s latest iPhones — the iPhone 7 Plus racks up a score of nearly 3500. But in multi-core Geekbench 4 tests, the S8 handily beats the latest iPhones, which always score under 5800. This is a big victory for Samsung on paper, but it remains to be seen how it will translate as far as real-world performance. As we’re sure you’ll recall, earlier Samsung phones have come close to matching Apple’s iPhones on paper, but iPhones absolutely obliterate Galaxy phones in performance tests that gauge real-world power and speed.

This is a hefty update to the previous 60 day timeframe limit, and should put users’ minds at ease with regards to damaged screens. While the new timeframe policy hasn’t been detailed on the AppleCare+ website, it has been confirmed by support employees. Also, Apple has an eligibility tool on the site that now reflects the changes. After inputting an iPhone’s serial number, the site will show coverage is still available for purchase if the device was bought less than 12 months prior. This means AppleCare+ for the iPhone is now on par with the AppleCare programs for Mac and AppleTV with regard to when coverage can be applied. There are no changes to the AppleCare+ programs for iPad, Apple Watch, or iPod Touch, which still must be purchased within 60 days of the device. AppleCare+ coverage sells for $129 for the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, and is $99 for the iPhone SE. With this service, screen replacements will only cost users $29, while other repairs will be $99 under the plan. Take note, however, that purchasing coverage requires an iPhone to be physically inspected in-store or undergo a diagnostic test online prior to activation. So don’t plan on purchasing the insurance immediately after having an accident with your device.

Cook’s comments come amid rising tensions between the US and China, with protectionist rhetoric from US President Donald Trump sparking concern of increased trade friction between the two countries. “The reality is countries that are closed, that isolate themselves, it’s not good for their people,” said Cook, in a rare public speech. Apple said yesterday it will set up two new research and development centres in Shanghai and Suzhou in China. It has pledged to invest more than 3.5 billion yuan (RM2.2 billion) in research and development in China. Apple has been singled out in Chinese media as a potential target for retaliation in the event of a trade war.

Business Insider however, traced the unverified claim to a vlogger back in December named Jay Way who claimed to have told Apple about his idea for screenshot alerts. There is absolutely no evidence that Apple is actually going to implement Way's idea or that any trustworthy source has made this claim. Apple itself has not commented on the matter so far. Although it's not surprising for old claims, especially related to upcoming devices and software to resurface on Twitter, many on the social media site expressed grave concern if such a thing were ever to happen.

Business Apps | 13 Mar 2017 | Listen  | Print  | Comment (16) How to Set Up and Use Airline Boarding Passes in Wallet by Adam C. Engst When Tonya and I first started taking airline flights back in the early 1990s, I found it almost overwhelmingly stressful. It stemmed from the fact that flying was so expensive for us, but I also dreaded the byzantine process of buying tickets, checking in repeatedly, and dealing with security. So much seemed to hinge on not losing tickets, boarding passes, or identification cards. We never made any mistakes, though, and in retrospect, misplacing a ticket or boarding pass likely wouldn’t have been a big deal. (The first time I flew to Canada, pre 9/11, I forgot my passport but was still allowed through customs with a stern talking-to. Who knows what would happen today!) I still don’t enjoy airline travel, but I’ve done it enough that it no longer stresses me out to the same extent, even as dealing with invasive and unpleasant security requirements has gotten far worse. Plus, thanks to the Internet and the iPhone, the logistics have become vastly simpler. Being able to buy tickets, check in, and print boarding passes online was the first step, and the next major improvement came when Apple released the Passbook app, since renamed Wallet. I’ve been using Passbook/Wallet as long as has been possible — it took smaller airports like Ithaca a while to get the necessary scanners — but as much as I liked eliminating the need for paper, there were many problems early on. Getting passes into Passbook was difficult, due to horrible airline apps, and bringing up the passes quickly and reliably was also hard. Even during our trip to MacTech Conference in Los Angeles in November 2016, when I was using an iPhone 7 running iOS 10, I had problems. I eventually realized the Raise to Wake option kept swapping the boarding pass for the lock screen every time I lowered my iPhone while waiting in line to board. But on my most recent trip, to Austin for the ASMC Summit for independent Apple resellers, everything just worked. The United app knew about my itinerary once I was logged in, and the Delta app figured it out once I entered the ticket number. Both notified me when I could check in, and made it easy to do that and add my boarding passes to Wallet. iOS 10 and Wallet were smart enough to display a constant notification on the lock screen during the time I needed it, a single swipe brought up the boarding pass, and it stayed on screen while I waited in line, regardless of Raise to Wake. I’m sure many of you are nodding your heads in agreement, or wondering why I’m telling you all this. I’m no frequent flyer, so I’m sure that these improvements have been obvious to road warriors for a while. But I wanted to document how to do all this because I saw a lot of people still relying on paper boarding passes on that last trip. The experience of relying on an iPhone is so good, and so much better than dealing with paper, that if you’ve avoided it so far, I urge you to give it a try next time. But feel free to print a paper boarding pass as a backup until you’re comfortable with using your iPhone instead! Get the Airline App -- The first step is perhaps the hardest. It’s not that finding or downloading airline apps is difficult or expensive — they’re all free, and you can download them from the App Store like any other app. Here are links for the main U.S. airlines: Alaska Airlines, Allegiant Air, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Frontier Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines, JetBlue, Southwest Airlines, United Airlines, and Virgin America. In my experience, the tricky part, particularly for those of us who have been traveling for many years, is logging in. I strongly recommend taking some time well before your next flight to set up the airline apps you might use. Do them all at once, since it can be a fussy, annoying process if you have old accounts, or if airline mergers have confused matters. It’s far easier to figure out your login information — usually some combination of frequent flyer number, email address, or username, plus a password or PIN — via the airline Web sites while working calmly on a Mac at home. You may need to ask for new passwords in some cases, and regardless, I’d encourage you to change your password to a 20-character random password and store it in a password manager like 1Password or LastPass. You have to assume that airline Web sites are under attack all the time, given the value of the information they store, and I imagine that identity theft surrounding airline travel could cause a world of hurt. So set strong passwords and make sure to use a password manager that you can access on your iPhone too. Check In and Add Boarding Passes -- Once you’re logged in to the airline app, it should be relatively obvious how you can check in for your flight, which you can usually do 24 hours beforehand. If you booked the flight through the same airline, the app might even know about your itinerary already. If not, you may have to enter a confirmation number or ticket number — I had to do that when using the Delta app to check in for the return leg of my last trip, which had originated on United. At the end of the check-in process, the apps I’ve used have provided a relatively clear Add to Wallet link or button. Tap it, and when it hands you off to Wallet, make sure everything looks correct in the boarding pass and then tap the Add link in the upper-right corner. You may or may not need to do this for each boarding pass; check to see what’s in Wallet after the first one. Now you’re ready for when you go to the airport. Call Up a Boarding Pass -- As you’re waiting in the security line, you’ll want to get your iPhone ready to display the boarding pass to the first security checker. Since Wallet knows your flight times, it starts displaying a notification on the iPhone’s lock screen some hours before. That notification appears every time you wake the iPhone, and you can swipe it to the right to display the boarding pass. Those with an iPhone 6, 6s, or 7 can also 3D Touch it and then tap a Show Pass button, but that’s a bit clumsier than the swipe. The boarding pass will stay on screen even beyond the time set in Settings > Display & Brightness > Auto-Lock, but as you approach the head of the line, check to make sure you haven’t inadvertently pressed the Sleep/Wake button on your iPhone. If you have an Apple Watch, you can instead bring up the Wallet app there — you might want to tap the Keep in Dock button to make it easier to get to for your return flight. The watch’s Wallet app shows the same passes that are in Wallet on the iPhone, and tapping the boarding pass shows you the same information, although you have to scroll down (or rotate the digital crown) to get to the QR code required for the scanner. While the Wallet app is up on the Apple Watch, the screen doesn’t turn off, so you don’t have to struggle with it when you get to the desk. Although I can’t imagine a scenario where this makes sense, you can prevent a boarding pass from appearing on your lock screen. Swipe right on its notification, tap the i button in the lower-right corner, and in the next screen, disable Suggest on Lock Screen. You can turn off automatic updates here too, but again, I can’t think of when it would be useful to have a boarding pass not update automatically. One final note. Since many flights have multiple legs, each with a separate boarding pass, note that Wallet seems to try to keep them together. If you see multiple dots at the bottom of a screen showing a boarding pass, try swiping left and right to move between them. The same applies if you’re traveling with a family and you have boarding passes for multiple people in your iPhone. Speaking of which, if you and your traveling companions all have iPhones and airline accounts, it’s usually possible for each person to manage their own boarding passes. But if not, you can check in for multiple travelers and add all their boarding passes to your iPhone, though that will require some swiping back and forth whenever you need to present them. Delete Passes -- Back in the day, you sometimes wanted to hold on to boarding passes to prove that you’d flown the miles for a frequent flyer program. In today’s world, unless you’re a tech writer who wants to keep a few boarding passes around to document how Wallet works, there’s little reason to retain them. To delete an expired boarding pass, open Wallet, tap the boarding pass, tap the i button in the lower-right corner, and then tap the Remove Pass option. Anything Else? -- It was difficult to document how all this works since I had to do it live, while juggling luggage and making sure I ended up on the right flight and in the right seat. There’s no way to simulate different scenarios or test something again. So, if I’ve missed something in this description of using boarding passes in Wallet, please let me know in the comments. Finally, what if you lose or break your iPhone, with all your travel documents on it, during your trip? If that happened to me while en route, I’d go to the nearest airline desk to see if they could print me a new boarding pass. And if it happened in the middle of my trip, which seems more likely, I’d try to get to the airport early for my departure, so there would be extra time to check in for the flight and get a printed boarding pass. If you have ever experienced such an iPhone disaster, leaving you without a boarding pass or information about your itinerary, tell us in the comments how you worked around the problem.

Receive comments via RSS Add a comment David Lutchko  2017-03-13 16:34 I was a road warrior and agree that using Apple wallet can be great. That said, ALWAYS carry a paper copy of your itinerary with you. You never when your phone starts misbehaving, or runs out of power (evening flights), etc. Sometimes, though, I found it hard lugging a carry-on with one hand, toting a small computer backpack, and then juggling the phone with my non-dominant hand to show the flight attendant my seat assignment--it almost fell between the jetway and the plane (would have landed on the tarmac!). That would not have been good. Another consideration, if traveling internationally I may be tempted to backup my phone using iTunes and restore it to factory settings just to prevent a possible Customs and Immigration privacy invasion, not so much because I'm paranoid but more out of principle. Reply Dennis B. Swaney  2017-03-13 23:17 Good point. In fact the NBC Nightly News had a story tonight (13 Mar 17) on the CBP demanding the phones and passwords of US Citizens at both land and air entry points. Reply Paul Albert  2017-03-13 20:56 I mean really all that trouble. Just print it out, fold it up and put in your wallet. Sometimes all this tech stuff just gets in the way of life. Flying is already stressful-why deal with this. Another headache. Reply Adam Engst   2017-03-14 11:35 I always found the paper boarding passes much more stressful. You have to remember to print them out, put them in a location where you won't forget (and my wallet isn't nearly big enough to hold an 8.5x11 sheet of paper), and then constantly be sorting through them to get the right one for the right leg of the trip. Plus, you have to take them out and put them back repeatedly as you go through security and (sometimes) check in, and if you have any other papers with you, it's easy for them to get mixed up together. And of course, paper boarding passes don't update with new gate or time information. The iPhone is always in my right front pocket or in my hand, and the Apple Watch is always on my wrist. Now that Wallet works well, I find it a much better solution. But hey, if you like the paper, there's nothing stopping you from using it. Reply tonyblunt  2017-03-13 23:11 I used the iPhone for a few years and the process has got much simpler. Now I use the watch, less juggling things but some airlines have code readers that you cannot get your wrist under, hopefully they will upgrade soon. Reply Adam Engst   2017-03-14 11:37 Yes, the scanners do have to be the right orientation for the watch. I didn't have trouble with that on this trip, but on some previous one, it was clear that I wouldn't be able to use the watch and I had to revert back to the iPhone. Reply Dennis B. Swaney  2017-03-13 23:21 Adam, since the CBP is now demanding access to the phones of returning US Citizens, you might as well get the app "Mobile Passport" so you can just give them your phone immediately before 3 of their goons tackle you. Reply Adam Engst   2017-03-14 11:40 Oh, don't get me started... The EFF has a page on privacy at the boarder, and I need to write more about it. http://www.eff.org/wp/digital-privacy-us-border-2017 Reply Tonya not the TidBits Tonya  2017-03-14 01:29 When my husband and I travel together, we always put both of our boarding passes on both phones to provide a backup in case one phone goes on the fritz during the boarding process. Reply Adam Engst   2017-03-14 11:37 That's smart! Reply Tonya Engst   2017-03-14 14:14 That is a very cute username! :-) Reply Tonya not the TidBits Tonya  2017-03-16 18:16 I kinda thought so, too ;-) Reply zaccone  2017-03-14 09:25 I often book flights on Southwest for my wife, son, and me. When I do that, I get one itinerary number and Southwest won't let me put the boarding passes on my phone. To fix this, I need to call Southwest and ask them to give each family member a separate itinerary number. They are willing to do this and it fixes the problem. I could probably accomplish the same thing by booking each of the flights separately, but I'm always afraid I won't get the same fare for each flight if I do that. Reply Adam Engst   2017-03-14 11:39 Interesting! I know I've put boarding passes for multiple people on my iPhone with the United app, but since I've lived in the Northwest and the Northeast, I've never flown Southwest. :-) Reply Bob Bryant  2017-03-20 09:17 If I put my boarding pass in Wallet, am I prohibited from also printing a back up paper pass? I've resisted using Wallet because I didn't want to depend exclusively on an unfamiliar system. Reply Adam Engst   2017-03-20 10:01 You can always print a boarding pass separately, just as you always have. If you're concerned, print the boarding pass first, and then add it to Wallet.

Which means, if you're an Apple fan but not into the whole 'leak everything about the phone before it arrives' scene, you'll need something to tide you over until the iPhone 8 arrives. Luckily, there's some impressive iPhone-related stuff to feast your eyes upon thanks to US firm Colorware, which has just produced a new retro edition of the iPhone 7 Plus. Related: iPhone 8 The iPhone 7 Plus Retro Edition is designed to mimic the look of a vintage 1980s-era Macintosh, and while it does just that very well, it doesn't come cheap. At $1,899 (about £1,530) it's certainly going to cost any rabid Apple fan who dares to shell out for this retro beauty, but there's no doubting the work that's gone into making the phone look authentically vintage. With a multicolored Apple rainbow logo made to look exactly like the original, and stripes adorning the edges, the originally-black iPhone 7 Plus manages to pull off the vintage look effortlessly. Here's Colorware on the new phone: "Colorware is pleased to announce the iPhone 7 Plus Retro Edition. If you love the vintage look of the original 1980’s Mac then why not have it on your phone! "Great attention to detail is given to this fully painted iPhone. With the multicolored Apple rainbow logo and the dark beige edge stripes your iPhone will be a work of art!" If you have the money to spend and want to pick up the phone, you'll have to be quick as the company says the Retro Edition will only be available for a limited time, with the first 25 featuring a number of authenticity. If you're wondering about specs, the iPhone 7 Plus being used for these painted models is a SIM-Free version with 256GB of storage. It also comes with EarPods, a Lightning to USB Cable, a USB Power Adapter, and documentation in the box, and orders are currently estimated to ship in 2-3 weeks.

In a rare public disclosure of closed-door music industry dealings with one of the biggest companies in the world, Chance the Rapper said Friday that he was paid half a million dollars by Apple to host his digital mixtape, “Coloring Book,” exclusively on its streaming service for two weeks last year. The rapper, who has long flaunted his independence from the record label system and his decision to not charge for music, said his burst of financial transparency was because of some critics’ questioning the veracity of his do-it-yourself ethos. “I feel like if I didn’t clear it up people would keep trying to discredit all the work we did to make Coloring Book what it became,” Chance, who won three Grammy Awards for the project in February, wrote on Twitter on Friday. “I think artist can gain a lot from the streaming wars as long as they remain in control of their own product.” He added that in addition to the $500,000, the deal included a 30-second commercial. “I needed the money and they’re all good people over there,” he said. Since its debut in the summer of 2015, Apple Music has partnered closely with artists, including Drake, Frank Ocean and Future, sponsoring tours, music videos and more as part of arrangements that often included exclusivity windows on new releases, which Apple hoped would boost its subscriber numbers as it competes with the streaming leader Spotify. (Tidal, the streaming service spearheaded by Jay Z, has also used the strategy.) “Do we see spikes when we do exclusives? Yes,” the Apple music executive Jimmy Iovine said in an interview with The New York Times last year. Larry Jackson, another Apple Music executive, called the tactic “a very powerful messaging tool, just marketing for the concept of streaming.” But until Chance’s revelation, the specifics of the deals with artists have largely remained opaque. Apple did not immediately respond to a request to comment on the rapper’s assertion. “Chance the Rapper didn’t take us to decide not to sign with a record label — he decided that a long time ago,” Iovine said in the interview last year. “We’re just a distribution platform and he chose us, thankfully, instead of all the others.” He added, “I think that Chance feels we delivered for him and we’ll do even better next time.” Apple Music is planning another big debut this weekend. “More Life,” a new release from Drake, is to premiere Saturday on the rapper’s OVO Sound online radio show on the company’s Beats 1 station. Drake, who has collaborated with Apple on his last three releases, in addition to his recent tour and videos, has proved to be the company’s most visible and consistent artist ambassador. But unlike his blockbuster “Views” album, which was exclusive to Apple for a time, “More Life” is expected to be widely available for streaming immediately upon release.

Home Industry Apple CEO Tim Cook calls for more global trade with China Apple CEO Tim Cook calls for more global trade with China Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook expressed support for globalisation and said China should continue to open its economy to foreign firms, while speaking at a forum in Beijing on Saturday. By: Reuters | Beijing | Published: March 18, 2017 5:17 PM Cook’s comments come amid rising tensions between the U.S. and China, with protectionist rhetoric from U.S. President Donald Trump sparking concern of increased trade friction between the two countries. (Reuters) Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook expressed support for globalisation and said China should continue to open its economy to foreign firms, while speaking at a forum in Beijing on Saturday. “I think it’s important that China continues to open itself and widens the door if you will,” said Cook, speaking at the government-sponsored China Development Forum. Cook’s comments come amid rising tensions between the U.S. and China, with protectionist rhetoric from U.S. President Donald Trump sparking concern of increased trade friction between the two countries. “The reality is countries that are closed, that isolate themselves, it’s not good for their people,” said Cook, in a rare public speech. Apple said on Friday it will set up two new research and development centres in Shanghai and Suzhou in China. It has pledged to invest more than 3.5 billion yuan ($508 million) in research and development in China. Apple has been singled out in Chinese media as a potential target for retaliation in the event of a trade war. The Global Times warned last November if Trump triggered a trade war with China, Beijing would then target firms from Boeing to Apple in a “tit-for-tat” approach. Also Watch: Apple CEO Tim Cook had also called for a crackdown on the epidemic of fake news and asked the governments to launch a public information campaign, media reports said. According to a report in Telegraph, Cook said that fake news was ‘killing people’s minds’ and necessitates a crackdown by the authorities and technology firms that would help providers of quality journalism and help drive out clickbait. “The outcome of that is that truthful, reliable, non-sensational, deep news outlets will win,” Cook was quoted as saying. To educate the people about the threat posed by fabricated online stories, Cook pitched for a campaign akin to those that changed public attitude towards environment. “We are going through this period of time right here where unfortunately some of the people that are winning are the people that spend their time trying to get the most clicks, not tell the most truth. It’s killing people’s minds in a way,” Cook said. Please Wait while comments are loading...

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile New iPhone 8 concept imagines the magic behind that big, beautiful screen Image Source: Gabor Balogh Chris Smith @chris_writes March 14th, 2017 at 2:31 PM Share Tweet We think we know plenty of details about the upcoming iPhone 8 Apple has planned for 2017, and that might be true. We’ve seen plenty of leaks that all tell the same general story. But it’s only a story about the phone’s design, which means the iPhone’s most important feature remains a mystery. Sure, the handset will have a large edge-to-edge OLED screen complete with an embedded fingerprint sensor. It’ll sport an advanced 3D camera, and it’ll offer wireless charging. But what about the software? How will iOS 11 put all the changes that we keep hearing about to good use? One graphic designer has given this subject a lot of thought and came up with an amazing iPhone 8 concept that highlights the core software features that may be headed to the upcoming new Apple flagship phone. Don't Miss: Leaks reveal the 10 most exciting new features coming to Samsung’s Galaxy S8 Discovered by Apple Insider, Gabor Balogh’s iPhone 8 (or iPhone X) concept is a lot better than other similar creations, as the designer also explains his line of thinking. Image Source: Gabor Balogh In a detailed detailed post, Balogh explains his choices for the concept iPhone 8 he created. The designer believes that Siri will play a major role in the upcoming iPhone. Other major technologies that Apple is betting big on — including face recognition, augmented reality, big data, and machine learning would — also be at the core of the operating system that powers Apple’s edge-to-edge iPhone. In Balogh’s view, lifting the iPhone would automatically turn on the rear camera, with the screen becoming translucent. Siri would be able to both hear the user and view the phone’s surroundings in order to provide smart, context-aware responses. The virtual Siri/home button would be found in the same place where the physical button currently resides, but the entire action area flanking it would be occupied by apps that Siri thinks you’d want to use next, depending on what you’re currently doing. Image Source: Gabor Balogh AR would also play a major role in navigation apps, as it would superimpose directions right on top of the real world, making the chore of finding one’s way even easier. Similarly, AR features would also be built into other apps. Balogh also believes health will be a major focus in iOS 11, as the iPhone could be used to monitor real-time health data from friends and loved ones. While this feature could be cool, it would only work if those people would actually wear smart devices that monitor such data. Image Source: Gabor Balogh At the end of the day, this is just a great iPhone concept that doesn’t have anything to do with Apple’s actual iPhone 8 plans. However, Balogh is right in one regard: The size of the screen alone is just a small piece of the puzzle. Image Source: Gabor Balogh “This design concept proved [to] me that edge-to-edge screens won’t happen just because of aesthetic purposes,” he explains. “[The design] can only come along with a revolutionary new feature from Apple, which fills up the whole screen with appropriate content. In this case, not the bigger display, but the new killer feature would sell the iPhone X.” We’ll just have to wait and see what killer features Apple packs inside iOS 11. Balogh’s full article is available at this link.

The iPhone H8: Gonna be so boring Mythperceptions: No, Apple is actually pretty good at design Video Watch SwapBots spring to life thanks to augmented reality Hey, who likes topical references? Because it’s March Madness time and in the Apple world that means a lot of loose speculation about what a bracket of fail this year’s iPhones will be, even though they’re not coming for months. Writing for the Forbes contributor network and the world’s most renowned slap fight dojo, Ewan Spence describes the coming apocalypse. “New iPhone 8 Leaks Reveal The Four Horsemen Of Apple’s Apocalypse.” (Tip o’ the antlers to Alex.) The Macalope knows that traditionally there are only supposed to be four horsemen of the apocalypse (hey, he reads X-Men comics), but it seems like in Apple’s case if you can’t come up with 16, 18, or 124 horsemen then you’re just not applying yourself. An almost perfect storm is coming for Tim Cook and his team at Apple. C’mon down to Earnest Ewan’s Cliché Outlet, just off the turnpike near the old grist mill. It is not going to kill the iPhone line stone dead… Oh. Good to know. First up is cost. There is little to suggest that the presumptively priced iPhone 8 will not start at $1000. …when your baseline model passes a grand on the sticker, people will pay attention. …anyone looking at the total cost of ownership is going to see an eye-watering amount. First of all, we don’t even know that the “iPhone 8” is the iPhone 8. It could be called the iPhone Pro. Whether it is or not, that’s effectively what it is. If you buy that the “iPhone 8” is coming then you must also believe that Apple will also be introducing other iPhones, presumably an iPhone 7s line. So it’s not like Tim Cook’s hitting the stage in September and saying “Surprise, suckers! Your iPhones are all a thousand bucks now!” Horse number two… can Apple justify the higher price? So… horse number two is horse number one. OK. The iPhone 8 of January 1st had fast cabled charging, wireless charging over a distance of one metre, a curved screen, a bright and vivid OLED display, touchID embedded into the screen... all of these are now being downgraded like tears in the digital rain. Horsemen, storms, replicants… this fan fic has everything. The underlying message of these two issues leads to the third horse… profit. ALL THESE HORSES ARE THE SAME HORSE. This stable is getting less full every minute. We’ll get to the end of this article and find there never were any horses at all. The horses were inside us all along. Or maybe they were the friends we made along the way. They just weren’t, you know, real horses. All of this leaves our fourth horse of reputation. Yes, the last horse is the effect on Apple’s reputation of releasing a very expensive phone. [The Count voice] There iz… ONE horse! Ah-ah-ahhh! Worst apocalypse ever.

When it does, it could be worth more than twice as much as Apple. Even more staggering: It would be more valuable than 13 of the biggest public oil companies combined. Jason Hall (TMFVelvetHammer) Mar 18, 2017 at 6:21AM Nearly three-quarters of a trillion dollars. That's how much Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), the world's current most-valuable, and most-profitable company is worth at recent stock prices. Over the past nearly 20 years, Apple has disrupted and come to dominate multiple industries, changing the way people listen to -- and buy -- music, use computers, and interact with technology in their everyday lives. It's not a stretch to say that Apple, if not invented, then perfected, the mobile computing era.  And with its stock trading around 17 times last year's earnings -- a substantial discount to the average P/E of the S&P 500 -- there's a case to be made that the iStuff company is actually undervalued.  Image source: Getty Images. But a state-owned behemoth, Saudi Arabian Oil Company, better-known as Saudi Aramco, is set to blow past Apple for the title of world's most valuable public company when it IPOs in 2018. Expectations are that the market will value Saudi Aramco at $2 trillion or more.  Here's a closer look at how massive this megacompany, which controls an enormous percentage of the world's oil, really is, as well as why Saudi Arabia is considering taking it public.  Saudi Aramco's value is in the oil it controls At that $2 trillion valuation, Saudi Aramco would be the biggest public company on the planet by a very wide margin. But the most telling measure of its size is how it compares to the biggest public companies in oil and gas: In billions. Chart by author. The 13 public companies listed on the chart above are some of the biggest in the oil and gas industry. Some, like ExxonMobil(NYSE:XOM) BP (NYSE:BP) Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:RDS-A)(NYSE:RDS-B), are fully integrated majors with assets across the oil and gas value chain, while others, like Enterprise Products and Phillips 66, are dominant participants in specific parts of the industry, such as transportation, refining, or petrochemical manufacturing. The list also includes Petrobras (NYSE:PBR) and PetroChina (NYSE:PTR), the Brazilian and Chinese state-controlled integrated oil companies.  Combined (red bar in the table above) these 13 public entities are worth $1.5 billion at current share prices. That means Saudi Aramco is expected to be worth $500 billion more when it goes public next year than the next 13 biggest oil companies put together. That's a baker's-dozen of the world's biggest oil companies, plus Microsoft just for good measure.  There are two factors that drive this value: How much oil it produces, and how much it holds the rights to produce. Here's how Saudi Aramco's daily oil and gas production compares to the other biggest public producers: In millions of barrels of oil equivalent per day (Boe/d). Chart by author. Data source: Company reports and filings. At more than 12 million barrels of oil-equivalent per day, Saudi Aramco produces more oil and natural gas than the next three biggest, ExxonMobil, Shell, and BP, combined.  Here's how Saudi Aramco's massive oil and natural gas reserves compare: In billions of barrels of oil equivalent. Chart by author. Data source: Company filings and websites. It would be difficult to overstate just how large Saudi Aramco's oil and natural gas reserves are as compared to any other oil company's. Anchored by the massive Ghawar oilfield, the company controls several of the biggest oilfields on the planet, with some of the lowest cash production costs. To be clear, Aramco doesn't own Saudi Arabia's oilfields. Those are Saudi government property. But it does have exclusive production rights, much in the same way other oil companies pay property owners for the rights to access and produce oil and gas.  Using the biggest-ever IPO to fuel a post-oil Saudi Arabia When Aramco goes public, it is expected to raise more than $100 billion, selling 5% of the company to investors. This would make its IPO easily the largest ever: In billions. Chart by author. Aramco's IPO is expected to raise almost as much capital as the next five biggest, combined.  This is a step toward a "post-oil" Saudi Arabia. Led by Saudi Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, the Saudi Aramco IPO is part of a bigger initiative -- transferring a number of kingdom-owned companies to the kingdom's sovereign wealth fund as part of its strategy to shift more of the country's economy away from the oil and gas industry which overwhelmingly dominates it today. The sovereign wealth fund has already been given stakes in two major Saudi companies: Saudi Basic Industries, one of the world's largest chemicals manufacturers, and National Commercial Bank, Saudi Arabia's biggest lender. The plan is for this fund to control $2 trillion in assets, and then use the profits they generate to plant the seeds of economic expansion outside the oil patch.  Saudi Aramco isn't targeting individual investors, either. Its ideal investors would be institutional owners such as pension funds and other sovereign wealth funds. According to recent news, China's $800 billion sovereign wealth fund, China Investment Corp, is in talks to be a major investor in the IPO. Looking forward When Saudi Aramco does go public, it's almost certainly going to become the biggest public company on earth, and will raise the most capital ever from an IPO. Should individual investors put its stock on their watch lists? There's a chance that it could make for a solid income investment, with what are generally considered the world's lowest cash production costs making its oil production profitable in any environment.  But for a litany reasons, it's far too early to make that call. Frankly, there's a lot investors need to know about Aramco before putting their capital at risk, and it's far from clear how much of  information this ultra-secretive company is going to make available to outsiders. This very well could prevent it from going public on American or European exchanges, where stringent disclosure regulations may require the company to reveal more than the Saudi government is willing to let be made public about its reserves and costs of production.  If that proves to be the case, individual investors should probably take it as a cue to avoid Aramco, no matter how big its oil reserves are, or how cheaply they can be extracted.  Jason Hall owns shares of Apple and Royal Dutch Shell (B Shares).

The company is known to be connected with various builders in order to  integrate its platform in the new houses. The latest on the subject – a journalist was invited to San Jose, California to check out the new HomeKit-enabled smart home. Let’s dive in to see some more details on the matter. Apple’s HomeKit Equipped Smart Homes For Sale In San Jose, California Tech reporter, Gabe Slate of KRON4 demonstrated the integration of Apple’s HomeKit in new smart homes. HomeKit costs $2500 per house that includes the devices with HomeKit support. These devices would act as a medium by which you can control quite a handful of operations at your home. Related This Tweak Only Sends iMessage Read Receipt When You Reply Back For starters, the owner of the house would simply make use of his or her iPhone or iPad and control the Kwikset lock on the main door. Moreover, users also have the ability to control room temperature through the Ecobee thermostat along with adjusting the lights via the Philips Hue and much more. Advertisement Apart from this, the owner of the smart home can also make use of Apple’s Siri Remote of the Apple TV and operate the fans in the rooms upstairs. Homeowners can also switch to a movie watching mode in which lights would dim and the blinds would automatically come down. This is not the first time that KB Home has offered home automation to house owners, instead it has been doing it for 10 years. However, one advantage that Apple’s HomeKit has is that users now do not have to open different apps to control different operations. The company’s HomeKit platform acts as a hub that controls all the supported devices. Related The App Store Now Has A Permanent Indie Games Section However, since Apple is new in the home automation industry, there are quite a handful of challenges that it has to cover. Jonathon Gaw speaking to The Mercury News stated that its not clear what products are users willing to use. Moreover, he also stated that its not even clear if the smart home product companies will be here in the long run. Nonetheless, there are new companies adopting support for Apple’s HomeKit platform and probably in the near future, we will see more details on the matter. This is it for now, folks. What are your thoughts on Apple’s HomeKit platform? Do you think it’s a neat idea for building companies to adopt home automation systems in new homes? Share your thoughts in the comments.

OVO Sound Radio was one of the first celebrity-driven Beats 1 shows, Apple financed his “Hotline Bling” video, VIEWS was an Apple Music exclusive, and he even appeared in a Taylor Swift-inspired ad spot for them. But More Life, his upcoming playlist project, will not be an Apple Music exclusive. Spotify teased the release from their official Twitter account, and Pitchfork reports that it will also be available on Amazon Music. Sorry, Apple — you had a good run! New @Drake.#MoreLife coming soon. pic.twitter.com/TwGlwfB3zE — Spotify (@Spotify) March 16, 2017 In other streaming news, Billboard reports that Spotify may be softening its hard-line anti-windowing stance. The service is nearing new deals with major labels that will allow artists to restrict music to paid subscribers for a short period of time. In exchange, the labels would agree to reduced royalty fees.

Wang Obsession The Identity Economy March 18, 2017 Sneakin'. (Reuters/Mario Anzuoni) Share Written by Amy X. Wang Obsession The Identity Economy March 18, 2017 In 2016, Drake’s celebrated rap album Views became one of the first music projects to debut solely on Apple Music—and unleashed a flurry of agitation over exclusive deals in the music business. While exclusives make tons of money for hit artists, they’re also regularly slammed for encouraging piracy and turning off fans. Fitting, then, that the controversy is now coming full circle with Drake. The rapper will release his newest project today (March 18), a “playlist” called More Life—but it won’t be an Apple Music exclusive this time, unlike Views and the slew of other deals he’s struck with the service in the past year. Spotify and Amazon both have confirmed to several music publications that they’ll have More Life available for streaming to their listeners, too. New @Drake.#MoreLife coming soon. pic.twitter.com/TwGlwfB3zE — Spotify (@Spotify) March 16, 2017 Several things could explain Drake’s sudden ditching of exclusives. More Life isn’t a full album, so Apple might not have cared all that much about sharing it with other platforms; the deal between the rapper and the streaming service might’ve simply expired, too. But there’s also the possibility that the music industry is finally putting its collective foot down against exclusives, and looking to new avenues of innovation. Drake’s label OVO is owned by Universal Music Group; Universal CEO Lucian Grainge announced last year—shortly after rapper Frank Ocean pulled off a stunning coup of independence from his label—that Universal is “done with streaming exclusives on one platform,” or so sources told Billboard. As beneficial as exclusive content may be to streaming services like Apple Music or Tidal, restricting the size of one’s audience isn’t always a winning strategy for those on the production side (i.e., artists and labels). While albums like Drake’s Views or Beyoncé’s Lemonade may have found wild success as exclusives, the majority of music projects aren’t big enough to convince fans to come to one platform over another. More Life won’t share the exclusivity-generated hype of Views, but it also stands a much bigger chance of being heard.

With that in mind, we want to take a look at the most important things to know about the iPhone 4s iOS 9.3.5 update. In March, Apple rolled out its highly anticipated iOS 9.3 update. It went through an extensive beta but the update immediately caused problems for iPhone and iPad users. To address these bugs and other lingering issues, Apple pushed out several new versions of iOS 9.3. iOS 9.3.1 arrived with some important bug fixes and patches. After that, Apple pushed out an iOS 9.3.2 update to the iPhone 4s and other iOS 9-powered devices. A few days after that, it released iOS 9.3.3 update. Soon after that, the company pushed out iOS 9.3.4 update. Shortly after the release of iOS 9.3.4, Apple released an iPhone 4s iOS 9.3.5 update. It will be the last update the iPhone 4s receives from Apple. The iPhone 4s will never get iOS 10. If you’re coming from the iOS 9.3.4 update, iOS 9.3.5 features three three patches and nothing else. If you’re coming from something older than iOS 9.3.4, your iPhone 4s iOS 9.3.5 update is going to be a much larger update. Apple’s previous iOS updates are baked in. With that in mind we want to take a look at the most important things iPhone 4s users need to know about the iOS 9.3.5 update’s performance, its problems, the iOS downgrade process, and more. iPhone 4s iOS 9.3.5 Reviews   1 / 7 We've been able to spend some quality hands-on time with many of Apple's other iOS updates but we haven't spent enough time to provide quality feedback about the iPhone 4s iOS 9.3.5 update. So, we must turn to the opinions of others. As we push further and further away from Apple's iOS 9.3.5 release date we've seen iPhone 4s users from all over the world relay feedback about the update's performance. If you haven't installed yet you should make it a point to dig into these mini reviews. iPhone 4s iOS 9.3.5 update reviews are still mixed months after the update's release. While some users are seeing solid performance in key areas like battery life and connectivity, others are complaining about lag, freezes, and occasional stuttering.  Some users have said that they are sticking with the iOS 8 update, others are saying that the iOS 9.3.4 and iOS 9.3.5 updates solved some of the lag issues they had with earlier versions of iOS 9. As of right now there is no clear cut answer which means those of you with an iPhone 4s need to be extremely careful with this upgrade. Dig into this feedback and decide if it's worth it to you and your device. For most of you, it will be thanks to the nature of the security patches on board.    1 / 7 23 Responses 04/20/2016 Enajrowe Reply Hurrah..!!!Ｉ ᴊᴜｓᴛ ɢᴏᴛ ᴘᴀɪᴅ 6784ＵＳＤ ᴡᴏʀᴋɪɴɢ ᴏғғ ᴍʏ ʟᴀᴘᴛᴏᴘ ᴛʜɪｓ ᴍᴏɴᴛʜ.

Since first moment the speaker play no sound. I turn back my phone to iOS 9.3.2 and everything is ok. I don’t want to risk my phone for an upgrade (9.3.5) that could be the last one. 09/05/2016 Petya Reply Hi Juan! How can I return my Iphone 4S from 9.3.4 to 9.3.3 ( Which version is better 9.3.3 or 9.3.2) ? Recently installed version 9.3.4 and the phone began to overheat and the battery is depleted… Need a help! Thanks 09/03/2016 johnny Reply Iphone 4s with 9.3.5 is perfect what are you all on? Still an amazing phone and still updating and supported. Get a new phone or accept things on a 5 year old phone takes time. 09/05/2016 Robert Jackson Reply I had my iPhone 4s since the beginning. And yes with 9.3.5 she is still kicking strong and doing well. I cannot say much for others, but if they have any problems with any updates. Just re-set the whole thing (make sure you on iCloud ) like a brand new phone, or to the last day like two days ago. And when all is boosted. You’ll have more storage for some reason , and everything you had since. And I have a 16 gigger (n####r) joke…. Smile….it won’t broke yo face! Jamaican Man. Make sure you have an iPad or MacBook. They all feed off one another like clockwork. Adios Gringgos 09/19/2016 premn Reply Anyone know if there is a further update coming. My 4S has become almost useless. And I’m pretty sure it was after the 9.3.5 update. I’m hoping they might fix it? Thanks. 09/30/2016 prem Reply Update: After one month of sound and other issues, my 4s suddenly started working fine with 9.3.5. Amost as if it needed a month to get used to the update. Thought I should share this here. 09/30/2016 Chris Reply 4s stopped working when I tried to update to 9.3.5. Never was able to upgrade, only shows the “plug into iTunes” and is basically bricked until I figure out how to fix it. 10/13/2016 Abramski Reply Can u put the device in DFU mode? You do it this way, make sure the phone is off AND connected to your mac or pc and leave iTunes open, press and hold down the power button and count 3 seconds, after you count those 3 seconds, you push down the home button but don’t release the power button, hold the power button and home button pressed simultaneously for about 10 seconds, in mean time the screen should turn black as you reach 6 or 7, after 10 second, release the power button but keep holding down the home button until you see a prompt in iTunes that will tell you to restore you’re iPhone. Good luck! 11/01/2016 Mike Morley Reply Since updating to ios 9.3.5 my iPhone 4s shuts down at 35% battery level. I have heard that Apple do not plan to release any further updates to iphone 4s so I either put up with this or upgrade the phone. Of course apple would love me to upgrade the phone. I also upgraded my ipad2 to ios 9.3.5 and found it would then not let me past password sign in, it to a great deal of time to sort this out including complete reset and restore of the machine. I don’t have time to fix apples mistakes so I’m switching to android, at least you are not badgered continuously to upgrade it’s operating system APPLE NEVER AGAIN ! 12/17/2016 Satheesh Reply When i update to 9.3.5 My 4s asking to connect itunes. I dont know why? Anyone can explain? 02/08/2017 NIROSH Reply what’s the Next date of 4s update 03/17/2017 Sue Reply 9.3.5 was the last update for 4S! 03/19/2017 user Reply battery problem and overheating..

The 10.5 inch iPad is expected to have an edge-to-edge display, a new virtual Home Button and other upgrades. Digitimes says updates to the 9.7 inch iPad and 12.9 inch iPad Pro are also in the pipeline … The best, strongest, Lightning cables ... buy braided cables here The supply chain analyst had previously predicted that the 10.5 inch iPad will not be ready for launch until May/June, but this latest report says that Apple has pushed the production schedule forward. The 10.5 inch iPad is expected to be almost the same physical size as the current 9.7 inch iPad Pro, but will gain an extra 0.8 inches in diagonal screen space by losing the left and right bezels, as the product has been described as having an edge-to-edge display. The bezel-less iPad would somewhat presage one of the big rumors for the new iPhone 8 in the fall, which is also expected to feature a bezel-less design. The report says an upgraded 9.7 inch iPad and refreshed 12.9 inch iPad Pro are also imminent. As the new 9.7 inch tablet is likely meant as a cheaper offering in the lineup, Digitimes says Apple will pitch the 10.5 inch and 12.9 inch iPad as the mid-tier to high-end competitors in the tablet market. Apple is only expected to make about 1 million 10.5 inch iPads per month, whilst the upgraded 9.7 inch model will see more a healthy ~3 million/month run rate. Digitimes is a supply chain centric site. Their claims about Apple hosting a product event to announce the new iPads in early April ‘to mark the inauguration of Apple’s new headquarters in California’ should be taken with heavy skepticism. Apple’s plans about an event can change on a whim and are not connected to the supply chain at all. However, it is reasonable to expect the new 10.5 inch iPad sooner rather than later off the back of this report. Digitimes says mass production of the 12.9 inch iPad may not start until May or June, but this does not preclude Apple announcing it alongside the 10.5 inch iPad in April. It makes sense for the ‘budget’ 9.7 inch model to also launch at the same time. Benjamin Mayo @bzamayo Benjamin develops iOS apps professionally and covers Apple news and rumors for 9to5Mac.

You might have noticed the company’s pay-at-table Presto touchscreen terminals at some restaurants already— its two big customers are Outback Steakhouse and Applebee’s— but its new Presto Prime terminal announced today offers a number of enhancements with Apple Pay among them: The best 4K & 5K displays for Mac The PrestoPrime EMV Terminal’s core benefits include: • Only pay-at-table system with dual processors using a securely partitioned payment module, which enables best-in-class end-to-end EMV security to safely support third party apps, premium content, and integration with complementary devices • Contactless mobile payment capability including Apple Pay, Android Pay, and Samsung Pay, as well as a QR code reader and camera In addition to support for Apple Pay and other mobile payment services, the new terminal also includes an integrated keypad for secure PIN entry, full international Chip-and-PIN support, and enhanced security and storage. E la Carte says it currently has around 90,000 of its previous generation terminals at use in over 1800 restaurants across the US, so there is quite a large number of restaurants that could likely upgrade to the new system and start offering Apple Pay. There’s no word on when Outback Steakhouse, Applebee’s or other Presto terminal customers might be implementing the new system, but the company notes that the new Presto Prime product is software-compatible with the old system, so you’ll likely see restaurants upgrading and moving to the newer terminals in the near future. While support for Apple Pay through systems like Presto Prime will bring table side payments to more restaurants, we recently suggested that expanded support for bar tabs and restaurant bills is something that Apple should build directly into its platform. We asked if you’d want and use such a feature, and over 73% of you said yes. Having it built into Apple Pay as a native feature, opposed to going through third-party systems or having to download apps, would certainly greatly increase adoption among restaurants, live events, and other retailers.

Sony A6500 Specifically, tvOS 10.2 beta includes these changes: Accelerated Scrolling support for UIKit and TVMLKit apps Device Enrollment Program support Expanded Mobile Device Management support Support for the VideoToolbox framework While tvOS 10.2 doesn’t include any flashy new features, Apple has been steadily improving the platform with new video features including the new TV app and Single Sign-on. Here’s how Apple describes the TV app that was introduced in December: Watching TV has quickly become all about apps. And now, with the new TV app, you have one place to access shows and movies from multiple video apps — in one unified experience. The TV app lets you see all the movies and shows you’re watching. Find upcoming episodes. Get recommendations for new things to watch. See your entire iTunes video collection. You can even start watching a movie or show directly from the TV app. All without switching between individual apps. Single Sign-on is a separate feature introduced in December that lets users easily authenticate with a supported TV provider once, then access paid video apps that support the feature. tvOS 10.2 beta is only available for registered developers. Public beta versions of iOS and macOS are available, but tvOS and watchOS betas are only available through Apple’s developer program.

Sony A6500 Apple is also introducing SiriKit to Apple Watch with watchOS 3.2 beta. SiriKit lets developers integrate their apps with Siri for select uses. Prior to watchOS 3.2 beta, SiriKit was limited to iOS apps. As for Theater Mode, this is how Apple describes the new feature: Theater Mode lets users quickly mute the sound on their Apple Watch and avoid waking the screen on wrist raise. Users still receive notifications (including haptics) while in Theater Mode, which they can view by tapping the screen or pressing the Digital Crown. And here’s how Theater Mode looks on Apple Watch: Check out our hands-on video with Theater Mode below: watchOS 3.2 beta 2 included a subtle change: Control Center toggles reorganized (Series 2 from top left to bottom right: Battery, Airplane Mode, Mute, Do Not Disturb, Find My iPhone, Water Lock, Theater Mode, AirPlay) We’ll update with any changes discovered in watchOS 3.2 beta 6.

The Ugreen Power Bank with Magnetic Charger not only features the portability that some Apple Watch owners are seeking, but it also features a built-in battery for wireless charging while away from a wall outlet. And here’s something that you don’t always see when it comes to third-party offerings — a built-in magnetic charging puck, meaning there’s no need to provide your own charger. Not only will such a setup save you money, but it also keeps you from having to finagle with inserting or mounting Apple’s own charger. Watch our brief hands-on video walkthrough inside for a rundown of the device’s features. The best wireless keyboard for the Mac? The Ugreen Power Bank comes with the a micro USB cable for recharging the unit’s built-in battery. The charger itself is covered in a black rubber material and features a metal power button along with four LEDs to indicating charging and discharging status. Pressing the power button will turn the unit on, and pressing the button a single time while the unit is powered-on will cause the LEDs to light up to display how much battery life remains. Specifications Lithium Battery Capacity 2200mAh Charge cutoff voltage 4.2V Micro USB input DC 5V/1500mA USB Output DC 5V/1000mA Magnetic charger DC 5V/1000mA Dimensions: 139mm-by-39.5mm-by-16mm Made for Apple Watch (MFi certified) Video walkthrough Subscribe to 9to5Mac on YouTube for more hands-on videos A long press on the Power Bank’s power button will turn the device off. If the charger is not connected to charging equipment, it’s smart enough to go into standby mode after a period of inactivity. I found the Ugreen Power Bank to be very convenient, as not only did it allow me to charge my Apple Watch while away from home, but I could also leverage the 5W USB port to recharge my iPhone if needed. Granted, a 2200mAh battery isn’t capable of fully recharging my iPhone 7 Plus, but it’s a nice option to have for topping off the battery if nothing else. The feature that makes this Apple Watch accessory so attractive is its portability. I can easily stick it in my pocket or backpack and keep my Apple Watch charged with minimal effort. It’s unfortunate that the unit still uses micro USB, but I understand that it’s taking some time for manufacturers to fully move over to USB-C. Yep, it works with Nightstand mode At just shy of $60, the Ugreen Power Bank isn’t cheap, but the fact that it comes with a built-in magnetic charger, an item that normally costs around $30, eases the sting of the price. If you can live with the micro USB charging and you often find yourself devoid of Apple Watch battery life while on the go, then I recommend this product.

At the time, Apple denied any involvement and said that “retailers set their own prices” for the products. Now, Russia’s Federal Antimonopoly Service, however, has found Apple guilty of price-fixing in the country… Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case As noted by The Financial Times, Russia’s Federal Antimonopoly Service found that Apple had illegally ordered retailers to fix prices of the iPhone 5 and iPhone 6 models. Specifically, Apple apparently instructed 16 retailers in Russia to set the prices at a certain amount and if a retailer was found to be selling the iPhone at an “unsuitable” price, Apple would contact them and order them to change the price or risk having the sales agreement terminated. In a statement, the FAS had the following to say, translated: The investigation revealed that since the start of official sales in Russia of the Apple iPhone 5s, iPhone 5c, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, most resellers installed the same prices on them as recommended by Apple Rus and supported them for about 3 months. At the same time, Apple Rus monitored retail prices for Apple iPhone smartphones installed by resellers in online stores and retail outlets, and, in caseof setting “unsuitable” prices, the Russian subsidiary Apple sent emails to resellers with a request to change them. Also, compliance with recommended retail prices by resellers could be due to the provisions of contracts between Apple Rus and resellers. Apple has yet to comment on the ruling, but FAS head Andrey Tsarikovsky explained that Apple has “actively cooperated” with the agency to resolve wrongdoings: “In the course of the proceedings the Russian subsidiary of Apple actively co-operated with the FAS,” said the agency’s deputy head, Andrey Tsarikovsky. “The company has adopted the necessary measures to eliminate violations of the law and is pursuing a policy to prevent similar violations in the future.” It’s unclear at this point what sort of punishment Apple could face for its price-fixing in Russia. The company has three months to file a challenge, but it’s unclear if it plans to do so at this point. The worst case scenario for Apple is that it will be fined 15 percent of its sales in Russia, but that won’t be decided for another few months.

The Chicago rapper claimed that Apple paid him for two weeks of exclusivity for his mixtape Coloring Book on their music streaming platform Apple Music. "That was the extent of my deal, after 2 weeks it was on SoundCloud for free," he wrote. "I needed the money and they're all good people over there." "I just wanna remain transparent.

Last year, Anohni said she regretted selling her "Drone Bomb Video" to Apple Music. "My being bought as a politically outspoken artist is a more potent advertising tool for Apple than a 100 more explicit ads," she said. "It creates the false aura for Apple of being cutting edge, of being artist advocates, of being innovative mavericks, of being environmentally friendly, of caring about people and communities, instead of being the McDonalds of consumer high tech whose wealth was largely pilfered from what was once a biodiverse music industry."

Tech Apple Science Cars Geneva Motor Show Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES     Apple Sets Up Two New R&D Centers In China Posted: Mar 18 2017, 1:58am CDT | by IANS, in News | Apple   Photo Credit: Getty Images   To boost local talent, tech giant Apple has announced it would invest $508 million in China to build two additional Research and Development (R&D) centres in Shanghai and Suzhou. Don't Miss: Win a Free Nintendo NES Classic in our Giveaway According to a report in MacRumors on Friday, Apple's attempt to boost its presence in China began last September with the opening of its first R&D centre in Beijing's Zhongguancun Science Park, often referred to as "China's Silicon Valley". "We are looking forward to working with more local partners and academic institutions through the expansion of R&D centres in China," Dan Riccio, Senior Vice President (Hardware Engineering) at Apple, was quoted as saying. "We are honoured to have access to excellent talent and a positive entrepreneurial spirit in the region, where our developers and suppliers will be working together," Riccio added. With the investment of $508 million, Apple will have four centres in China in total. Apple's gets most of its products manufactured in China and also sources its best electronics engineers from the there. "So it seems logical that Apple would go beyond partnering with local firms in China by creating its own research centres. This way, Apple has a foot on the ground and gets the best of both worlds," the report noted.

Image: Kirill Nastasin/Shutterstock Huawei’s P10 smartphone series is about to hit the market. Can it really give the Apple iPhone 7 a run for its money? The P10 and P10 Plus, the successors to the Huawei P9 line that brought the ‘bokeh effect’ to the smartphone world, are the Chinese tech and telecoms giant’s flagship phones for 2017. And, straight away, it is obvious that they are designed to compete with the Apple iPhone 7. Mustering all the showmanship in its powers, Huawei has created two new colours for the handsets with the Pantone Colour Institute – greenery and dazzling blue – and, in an enduring partnership with Leica, revealed a device that once again is pretty much more camera than phone. Huawei has set a benchmark for affordable but high-end smartphones, and it wants to prove that you don’t need to spend almost €1,000 to get a decent smartphone. Specs Image: John Kennedy The 5.1in P10 comes with 4GB of memory and 64GB of storage, with expandable memory of up to 256GB, while the larger 5.5in P10 Plus has 6GB of RAM, 128GB of storage and 256GB of expandable memory, with MicroSD slots and dual SIM slots. The battery capability is almost double that of the iPhone 7, with a 3,200mAh battery on the P10 and 3,750mAh for the P10 Plus. As well as greenery and dazzling blue, the new P10 comes in a number of nice finishes, including ceramic white, graphite black, prestige gold, mystic silver and rose gold. The devices are just 6.98mm thick and have Gorilla Glass 5 panelling, with almost no bezel to the sides. The device runs on Android 7.0 and has a Huawei Kirin 960 quad-core processor inside. The key feature of the phone is its camera, which sports SLR-like settings and modes for night-time and daytime photography. Both phones have a Leica-branded dual camera system, which consists of a 20-megapixel monochrome sensor, as well as a 12-megapixel sensor for colours. It is capable of shooting in 4K video and, thanks to a H.265 codec, videos can be compressed by 50pc. Huawei has also beefed up the capabilities of the 8-megapixel front camera, which includes a new F/1.9 aperture and a sensor that captures more light. Performance Image: John Kennedy The first impression of the 5.1-inch P10 I reviewed is just how light and bright it feels. It boasts a nice clean design and smooth finish. The fingerprint sensor kicks in instantly and the Kirin processor does its work in a swift, snappy way as you flit around the screen. Everything just feels smooth and fast and elegant. The model I reviewed was the mystic silver version, which out of the whole gamut of colours is probably the most ordinary looking of the range. Don’t get me wrong, it is still a very attractive phone, but the problem these days is that smartphones all look the same and, in its zest to take on the iPhone 7, the Huawei P10 doesn’t look too dissimilar from Apple’s flagship handset. Apart from coming up with some dazzling hues of green, blue, gold, rose gold and even a kind of black that unashamedly takes on the iPhone 7’s jet black, Huawei knows it needs to knock it out of the park to compete. That’s where the camera technology really kicks in. The winner here is the portrait mode. This uses 3D face detection and a cocktail of bokeh and beauty effects to really bring photos out of themselves. It’s a kind of magic. The reality is that people want good photos and selfies, but they don’t really understand all the wizardry that involves figuring out the SLR settings. Under the hood, if you want that kind of complexity, it is all there in spades. Another notable detail is the radio technology. At Mobile World Congress, Richard Yu, CEO of Huawei’s consumer business group, described the P10 as the world’s first 4.5G smartphone, with four LTE radios in a quad-antenna/MIMO array providing stronger connectivity. This, he said, promises not only faster speeds but a 60pc less chance of dropped calls in areas of weak signal. Verdict: 4.5/5 Image: John Kennedy There is literally very little to fault with the P10. You get the feeling that Huawei has upped the number of apps that come with the device, so it feels less Spartan than the P9 and comes with useful tools like a torch and notepad. My only niggle with the bolted on apps was unnecessary limitations. Take, for example, the sound recorder app – you can record perfect audio but there is no way to share it, either by social media or basic email; it stays on the device. Instead, you need to get around this by downloading your own recorder of choice from the Play Store. First world problems, eh? Minor frustrations aside, Huawei is swiftly becoming an affordable alternative to the established order of Apple and Samsung smartphones and, if it keeps going at the present pace, it will be the established order. That is as soon as people learn how to pronounce ‘Huawei’ properly. It’s ‘Hoo-wa-way’. Alright? The critical thing is that, in just five years, the Chinese company has come from nowhere in the mobile space to really challenge the top players. It will be interesting to see where Huawei goes next in terms of devices like tablets, VR and wearables. The company also launched Watch 2, which comes with 4G connectivity, at Mobile World Congress. If you want a smartphone with a high-end camera, a blisteringly fast processor and pretty much everything that the iPhone or Samsung Galaxy can offer – at a reasonable price – then the P10 is the one for you. It looks the part, it feels the part and Huawei knows it can play the part. Pricing and availability Image: John Kennedy The new flagship phones will retail at €649 for the P10, which has a 5.1in display, and €699 for the P10 Plus, which will have a 5.5in display. The Huawei P10 will be available in Ireland in graphite black and mystic silver from mid-March via online pre-registration, with an exclusive Huawei Accessory Gift Box worth €149.99 – which includes selfie stick and tripod – from all major providers. You can pre-order the phone from 23 March and it will be available in retail stores from 4 April. The Huawei P10 Plus will be available in graphite black exclusively from Three for a limited time from mid-April, and all other major providers from May. There are plans to make the Huawei P10 and P10 Plus available in greenery and dazzling blue later in the year. Huawei P10 smartphone.

The previous window of opportunity that Apple offered was within 60 days of the date of purchase. Even though it doesnt reflect on Apples information site just yet, go ahead and give it a try. Head on over to the AppleCare support page and enter the serial number of your iOS device. If youve purchased it within the year, you should be able to see an Eligible for AppleCare+ notification whose link will lead you to another page where you can purchase the extended protection. The change only applies to iPhones at this time, so no extra protection for your Apple watch or iPad if you bought it more than 60 days ago. AppleCare+ starts at $99 for the iPhone SE, or $129 for the iPhone 6S, iPhone 6S Plus, iPhone 7, and iPhone 7 Plus. It covers damage up to two times during the protection period. Youll have priority access to Apples 24/7 support line, mail-in or carry-in repairs, as well as 'Express Replacement Service'. Screen damage repair is just a $29 service fee, while any other damage is also covered for a higher $99 service fee.

According to a report in MacRumors on Friday, Apple’s attempt to boost its presence in China began last September with the opening of its first R&amp;D centre in Beijing’s Zhongguancun Science Park, often referred to as “China’s Silicon Valley”. “We are looking forward to working with more local partners and academic institutions through the expansion of R&amp;D centres in China,” Dan Riccio, Senior Vice President (Hardware Engineering) at Apple, was quoted as saying. “We are honoured to have access to excellent talent and a positive entrepreneurial spirit in the region, where our developers and suppliers will be working together,” Riccio added. With the investment of $508 million, Apple will have four centres in China in total. Apple’s gets most of its products manufactured in China and also sources its best electronics engineers from the there. “So it seems logical that Apple would go beyond partnering with local firms in China by creating its own research centres. This way, Apple has a foot on the ground and gets the best of both worlds,” the report noted. –IANS qd/vm Tags China firms local report CanIndia New Wire Service Related Posts LeEco partners with Amazon for attractive offers on TV Mar 21st, 201702 New Delhi, March 21 (IANS) Chinese internet and technology conglomerate LeEco on Tuesday announced an...

With an IPO under its belt this month, Snapchat has cleared its first major hurdle. If Apple's smart, the next one should be in June. That's Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference, and the stakes are high to unveil something great to accompany 10th anniversary iPhone. I'm not saying that Apple should recreate Snapchat — it doesn't have to. By creating a better version of just one Snapchat feature — messaging — Apple could siphon potential Snap customers into iMessage and revive interest in the iPhone brand. Apple has end-to-end technology Snap's disappearing messages launched its popularity, but Lenses — which superimpose dynamic imagery onto photos — are the secret sauce. There's an abundance of evidence that Apple can build something similar. In February, Apple received this patent on creating custom shape-shifting avatars. Tim Cook has repeatedly expressed interest in in augmented reality and may have more than 1,000 engineers working on it, according to a UBS note. Goldman Sachs thinks it will come out in the iPhone 8 later this year, and industry analyst Ben Thompson thinks the powerful camera on the iPhone 7 Plus is a dead giveaway. Analysts at JP Morgan even think the next iPhone will have facial recognition. And Apple is already adding fun effects to iMessage. Apple can one-up Snap because it has control over the hardware. Snap's graphics are limited by the lowest quality camera and processor of the phones it runs on. Apple, on the other hand, makes its own camera and its own chips — and they're good. Apple controls app distribution and has a developer platform at its disposal. Most of Snap's users already get it from the App Store. And iMessage, unlike Snapchat, has access to an entire ecosystem of iMessage apps. Imagine sending a Snap with an Apple Music soundtrack! show chapters Here's how to use all the cool features on Apple's new iMessage    Thursday, 29 Sep 2016 | 6:09 PM ET | 00:43 Apple's iMessage has a critical mass of high-value users Many of Snap's most popular features aren't difficult to recreate — Facebook's copycats show that. What is difficult to replicate is Snap's highly dedicated, engaged user base. Facebook, while accessible, long ago shed the exclusivity it had with college students. Snap's interface is minimal and cool, but opaque to some older users. If only there were a company with both ... known for software that is intuitive, yet has a minimalist design ... software that exudes a sense of exclusivity and creativity, and has a cult following. Oh yeah, it's Apple. Despite Snap's popularity, teens still use SMS. CNBC's college interns tell me that iMessage's blue bubbles and "superior emojis" are considered more cool, and it's somewhat shameful to text with a green (non-Apple) message. This is clearly something that Apple is trying to play up in their new ad, below. Big pile of money Snapchat has some things iMessage lacks, like a social feed and a broadcasting platform. That's fine. Apple doesn't need to copy every Snapchat feature. Apple may not have a social feed, but it's already got a list of all your closest friends and family members: your contacts list. Instagram's co-founder Kevin Systrom told Recode that engaging with friends and family moves the needle much more than celebrities or other content. And Apple isn't an advertising company and doesn't need advertising dollars. It just needs to be cool enough to get people to buy an iPhone. Eventually, folks may pay for other services, like Apple Music, because they work within the app. And users wouldn't have to deal with annoying ads in their personal messages. Apple's software endeavors haven't always been executed perfectly. But Apple can afford to revolutionize messaging without worrying about stemming a $514.64 million loss and reviving a struggling stock. Commentary by CNBC's Anita Balakrishnan.

As it turns out, Apple quietly recruited college students to be its Apple Music ambassadors. This new marketing campaign is Apple’s attempt of promoting its music streaming platform. In exchange, students that engage in the program would be given an extra three months of free service after the campaign stops next month. Based on the instructions, the Student Ambassadors simply have to share the links to content from Apple Music and use the graphic ad they prepared for Twitter. Both the Student Ambassador who took part in the program and anyone who uses the ad will be entitled to free three months of service. Since each one will have a unique affiliate link, Apple will be able to keep track of each student’s success. More importantly, the Ambassadors who perform the best for each task will be entitled to exclusive perks from Apple Music. Some of these perks include access to the much awaited Apple Music Festival. After digging around, it turns out the program is being handled by a third-party marketing company called Social Chain that Apple hired. As it turned out, the company reached out to prospective students and asked them if they wanted to be an Apple Music Ambassador. Another way they gained attention from interested individuals was by running a targeted ad on Facebook for intended for students. Apple then handpicked the rightful ambassadors with an instruction to keep quiet about the campaign until the first task started. The first few tweets with the hashtag came from a few users based in the U.K. Soon enough, the hashtag trended throughout the country. There’s no word on whether or not this Ambassador campaign will expand to other countries.

The practice is scrupulously legal—and therefore OK in the eyes of many. I, however, don’t think it’s right. The Situation Apple is a world leader in structuring its global operations so that profits are accounted for in low-taxing districts, regardless of where its products were actually sold. Apple pays enormous taxes in the U.S.—it’s the largest taxpayer in its home country—but it pays next to nothing in most parts of the world. As stated above, these practices are assuredly legal. At the very least, Apple’s tax practices have survived intense scrutiny from countries where Apple pays little or no taxes. The closest thing to a legit legal challenge to Apple’s practices has been questioning from grandstanding U.S. Senators and a most-likely-to-fail complaint against Ireland by the European Union. To that end, Apple Australia issued this statement to The New Zealand Herald: Apple aims to be a force for good and we’re proud of the contributions we’ve made in New Zealand over the past decade. Because our products and services are created, designed and engineered in the US, that’s where the vast majority of our tax is paid. All Politics (and Sales) Are Local At least some New Zealand politicians aren’t having it. Green Party co-leader James Shaw told The Herald: It is absolutely extraordinary that they are able to get away with paying zero tax in this country. I really like Apple products – they’re incredibly innovative – but it looks like their tax department is even more innovative than their product designers. That’s the thing. Companies with local operations should pay their fair share of taxes to local taxing districts. Roads, schools, services—all of these things are used to support Apple and its employees. All of these things support each and every Apple sale to local residents. Apple should pay its fair share to support the things that make those sales possible. I’ve made this argument before, and plenty of people disagree with me. To them, Tim Cook has a fiduciary responsibility to maximize profits for its shareholders, the end. The same is true for every other CEO of American corporations large and small. Next: Do the Right Thing, Apple’s Good, and Final Thoughts Pages: 1 2 Next Page Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Reddit More Email Print Tumblr Tags: Apple, New Zealand, taxes, Tim Cook 15 Comments Add a comment John Kheit March 17, 2017 Totally disagree. If Apple is following the law, then kudos to them. Further, Bryan, the page views/ads this story, this website, and podcasts from it go to many other states where you guys do not pay taxes, yet TMO derives beneficial income from activities in all those states, and yet pays 0 taxes there. So I know it’s perfectly legal, and why I have no problem with it myself, since you don’t think such things are right, I look forward on your report of paying supplemental and non-necessary taxes there. 😀 March 17, 2017 at 9:56 EDT PM Samuel Lethaby March 18, 2017 I don’t know where the previous response is coming from. I would say amusing at very least. As a NZ RN I pay close to $1000 in tax. Locally owned businesses pay tens of thousands a month in tax to support the infrastructure that is quote “systemically underfunded”. Yet many overseas cooperations come here and literally take billions of dollars away from the economy by manipulating loopholes In the tax laws. The rest as to why this continues to be legal is completely beyond me and many of us here in New Zealand March 18, 2017 at 2:55 EDT AM John Kheit March 18, 2017 Well I’ll give you a hint without knowing anything about New Zealand. Your lawmakers made laws like that. Either the majority of folks are actually OK with that and that’s why you have those lawmakers, or you need to convince or remove and elect other lawmakers to do what most people like. That’s my out of left field speculation. Most loopholes, here and abroad, on taxes aren’t really accidental. They are enacted purposefully. Ireland new darn well what deal it was cutting. Perhaps NZ didn’t, but if the law has been that way for multiple years, I’d guess that the govt knew what it was doing, and had its reasons. March 18, 2017 at 3:33 EDT AM Lwio March 18, 2017 Apple along with many others whilst following the rules may be legally right but it’s certainly not ethically right. The problem is the rules and the people who make them, the politicians. They could stop this tomorrow if the agreed to change the system but there’s too many interests, too much corruption involved. Given the apathy of the electorate this will never change. March 18, 2017 at 5:21 EDT AM KiwiPhred March 18, 2017 As a New Zealander I’m pretty sure this is an incomplete picture of Apple’s tax payment in NZ. While they may be using the law to avoid paying taxes on profits here as they do elsewhere there is also a little thing called Goods and Services Tax which is applied to all their products at the rate of 12.5%. So sales of their products here do contribute to the NZ’s government’s coffers as opposed to the claims of zero contribution made in the article. March 18, 2017 at 9:34 EDT AM Alan March 18, 2017 New Zealand collects a large (15%, if I recall) GST sales tax on every purchase. That is, NZ collects significant taxes for every Apple product sold in NZ. The real question has nothing to do with how and where taxes are collected, but how much. 15% is partially from retail markups, and is paid more directly by the consumer than a direct corporate tax, but the real question is how much total taxes should NZ be enriched by Apple business in NZ. Perhaps it should be a lot more, but I have no problem with what route the money takes to get to the government. March 18, 2017 at 9:38 EDT AM skipaq March 18, 2017 Bryan, could you be more thorough? What exactly is Apple’s corporate footprint in NZ? What corporate taxes are they “avoiding”? Are we just talking about retail sales profits? If the later is the case then Alan and Kiwi answered that moral objection. You cannot be arguing that Apple should be paying Corporate profit taxes in every country an Apple product is sold. I would think the board would fire Cook for doing something like that. March 18, 2017 at 10:20 EDT AM early geek March 18, 2017 I think you are pointing at the wrong party. Apple didn’t write the rules/laws/tax rate. Those laws/rules were written by your politicians. Apple cannot change those rules. The politicians can. How much should Apple contribute? 10%? 15? Everyone is going to give a different answer. Shouldn’t there at least be some guidelines? – there are – it’s called the tax guidelines. And Apple is doing exactly what those guidelines say. Apple is a private entity and is answerable to its shareholders. The politicians on the other hand, are answerable to YOU You can’t change Apple. You *can* change politicians. March 18, 2017 at 10:07 EDT PM Rick Allen March 19, 2017 Bryan, I feel the issue is the same type of one that people complain about Apple not bringing back foreign profits back into the country. If people want different rules, then the government needs to change them. I don’t agree with not paying taxes. By all means support the locals. It seems that in many cases the common people are the least concern when governments make these tax laws and loopholes for corporations. There is another question, if Apple pays more taxes in a country, do they raise prices like they have in UK after Brexit referendum? Then what is the cause of that — possibly less sales, and then the net effect is less money March 19, 2017 at 1:34 EDT PM archimedes March 19, 2017 Bryan, are you sure this is accurate? Even if Apple if Apple isn’t paying certain taxes such as corporate income tax to New Zealand, its sales are almost certainly taxed via the GST. If the GST is 15%, then the tax on $4.2B would be some $630 million, certainly not “zero.” March 19, 2017 at 6:39 EDT PM archimedes March 19, 2017 @john kheit Hahaha, thanks to TMO’s resident lawyer and contrarian for weighing in on this. March 19, 2017 at 6:46 EDT PM geoduck March 19, 2017 Corporations have no business worrying about what is “right” and what isn’t in this matter. Their obligation to shareholders is to do what is legal. To do anything else lands them in hot water. If they fail to obey the absolute scrupulous letter of the law they will have government agencies after them, costing the company more. If they choose to not take advantage of every law as written, if the choose to pay a “fair” amount” or “what is right” then they will have a shareholder revolt on their hands which will cost the company more. They might even get the SEC after them. Either way Apple is doing exactly what they as a publicly traded corporation have to do. They have no wiggle room in this regard. March 19, 2017 at 7:26 EDT PM Laurie Fleming March 20, 2017 John Kheit: Either the majority of folks are actually OK with that and that’s why you have those lawmakers, or you need to convince or remove and elect other lawmakers to do what most people like. Politely: It is clear, as you say, that you know absolutely nothing about New Zealand. Up until Matt Nippert disclosed Apple’s tax avoidance, the extent of it was not known by the voting public. As the Labour Party leader Andrew Little has said, the ruling National Party has been asleep at the wheel over tax: Stuff. Labour itself has been lax in the past in stopping this, but National has had nine long years and still done nothing. But it’s hard to do anything about it – these large multi-nationals (and it’s of course it’s not just Apple) shuffle their tax dealings around the world until they find a spot where they have the least tax obligations. It’s whack-a-mole. Until the voters and tax-payers where they are not paying their fair share know about it and decide that this is not acceptable and force their governments to enact laws to stop it, these companies will continue to do it. But voting for or against a party is a binary choice – it’s possible but rare to make that vote in a particular way on a single issue. As for the companies responsibility for their shareholders overriding all others, I reject that as Friedmanesque ideology. It’s a cop-out. If companies want to do business in this country, they must follow New Zealand’s laws. And they can profit from it – there’s huge good will in being a good corporate organisation. Cartoon March 20, 2017 at 4:07 EDT PM John Kheit March 20, 2017 @Laurie, in other words, I’m right. Since it’s “difficult” you can get some money or no money from them. That’s the deal your representatives chose to take. And now the public “knows” we look forward to your voting the politicians in the “RULING” and voted in party, out for your agenda now. Want to make a bet? I love that you “disagree” with shareholder responsibility being ruled out by you. I’m sure that is of great police to the corporate officers when a shareholder suit is lobbed on them. I’m sure your post will totally put that in perspective during the law suit. Glad we have you on record as defender of truth and justice that is TOTALLY relevant to the real world. 🙄 March 20, 2017 at 8:04 EDT PM Scott B in DC March 20, 2017 I, however, don’t think it’s right. Bryan, there comes a point after reading this time and again I have to ask: What are you doing about it? Who are you complaining to? A bunch of people who come to a website called The Mac Observer that are Apple fans to begin with? Even if there are people here who agree with you, what are you doing and what would you like people to do? It’s like the boy who cried “Wolf!” one too many times. You are screaming into the proverbial hollow tube. What you are getting out is a form of an echo. To put it like my late mother used to: Stop kvetching and start stretching. What are you doing other than kvetching in so many words? Have you contacted your local representatives that control your state finances? How about your members of congress? Sure, they may be bought and sold by the lobbyists, but you can have an effect on them. As a small business owner, I am not sure I agree or disagree. I know I do not get the same tax breaks as the larger companies but I also know that when I have a problem, standing on a platform and screaming is not going to help. I’ve been to Annapolis (my state capital) to speak with my representatives. I’ve told them personally what my concerns are for both my business and the changes in the laws that they are proposing to help but will hurt me in the long run. I’ve learned to stop kvetching and I am stretching out to work with the people who are making the laws. My challenge to you is what will you do to start stretching? To start to make an impact? Otherwise, to borrow a quote from Macbeth, it’s all “full of sound and fury signifying nothing.” March 20, 2017 at 10:39 EDT PM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

It’s been another exciting week across the tech world, with no end of exciting news keeping us on our toes. But if you’ve struggled to keep with it all, fear not, for 7 Days is here once more with a handy walkthrough of the week’s top tech news. "Laser beam" Our journey begins this week on a beam of light, as researchers at the University of Michigan revealed significant progress in development efforts for “lightwave” computers, relying on ultra-fast laser impulses to get electrons firing at incredible speeds. Their discoveries could pave the way towards creating quantum computing devices. Amazon announced that it’s bringing support for its Alexa digital assistant to iPhones – but oddly, not in the Alexa app. Instead, the functionality is being added to the Amazon app on iOS devices. On Thursday, Apple released the seventh betas of iOS 10.3 and macOS 10.12.4 Sierra, both for developers, and testers on its Public Beta program. A passenger on a flight to Melbourne, Australia suffered injuries when her wireless headphones ‘exploded’ on board. The incident raised fresh concerns over battery-powered consumer devices on airliners, following the ban on Samsung’s Galaxy Note7 on flights last year. Tesla CEO Elon Musk spoke with Australia's Prime Minister, offering energy storage solutions and reliable supplies to solve recent electricity shortage issues that left 40,000 people without power in South Australia. But domestic energy suppliers criticized the government for even considering Musk’s offer, calling for a “transparent bid process” and a level playing field to give Australian companies “a fair go”. Over in the UK, telecommunications giant BT agreed to spin off its Openreach network division into a separate company that will provide rivals with access to its domestic network. Rivals such as Virgin Media mocked the move, claiming that it will make little difference to BT’s competitors and to UK customers, as Openreach will continue to offer “the same old snail’s paced network with a new shell”. In Russia, Apple was found guilty of price-fixing after regulators determined that it was compelling companies to sell many of its iPhones at a minimum retail price, stifling competition in the domestic market. Several Russians were among those alleged to have been involved in major digital attacks against Yahoo, which compromised hundreds of millions of user accounts. Image: Getty Images for Visa Visa is considering launching - or at least supporting - wearable devices with support for mobile payments – but rather than going down the ‘typical’ route of wristbands, it’s instead trialling sunglasses with NFC support. On Friday, Qualcomm announced that its processors will now be known as ‘platforms’, and that it's ditching the Snapdragon branding from its current Snapdragon 200-series chips, which will now be branded under the ‘Qualcomm Mobile’ moniker. Meanwhile, rival chipmaker Intel stunned the markets by announcing its $15.3 billion acquisition of Mobileye, an Israeli company that focuses on developing technology for autonomous vehicles. The purchase is a hugely significant move for Intel, giving it a huge boost in the technology behind self-driving cars. Intel was also a key partner in the launch of Tag Heuer’s new Connected Modular 45 smartwatch, an Android Wear 2.0 device with a diverse ecosystem of modular accessories. Promising more than a day of power, along with water resistance, the new device also comes with a hefty price tag: you’ll need to hand over $1,600 to own one. Google has developed a new system to replace the infuriating CAPTCHA tool, which features on many websites that demand that you prove that you’re “not a robot”. The "invisible reCAPTCHA" system works in the background and uses magic and witchcraft "an advanced risk analysis engine" to determine that real humans are accessing websites. Meanwhile, the latest version of Chrome’s web browser brings massive improvements in power usage for PCs, as well as introducing a new offline reading mode to iOS. Google also updated its Gmail app on Android allowing users to send and request money, just as easily as sharing an attachment. Impressively, the company says that the feature is "completely free" for both senders and recipients. Sony’s new ultra-thin Android TV, the Bravia OLED 4K HDR TV, finally got a launch date and official price tag this week – but you’ll need to be earning some serious dough to be able to afford one. Samsung also announced details of its new QLED TVs this week, featuring ‘Quantum Dot’ technology, with the 55-inch models starting at almost half the price of Sony’s 55-inch OLED TVs. Those who pre-order LG’s impressive new G6 flagship in the United States will get a free Google Home speaker hub worth $129.99 with the device. T-Mobile will be offering the new phone in the US, and announced its pricing this week. Google Home is powered by the Google Assistant – but it hasn’t been a great month for the digital assistant so far. After spewing loony conspiracy theories last week, Google Assistant unexpectedly threw in ads for Disney’s new Beauty and the Beast movie a few days ago. However, Google later insisted that the ads weren’t ads at all, but rather “timely content”. And after announcing wider availability of the Assistant on Android 6.0 Marshmallow and 7.0 Nougat devices last month, Google confirmed this week that it won’t be supported on any Android tablets. Nougat is currently installed on just 2.8% of active Android devices. Google is believed to be planning to release the newest version of the OS, Android 7.1.2, on April 3 – but for now, its long, slow rollout continues to more handsets: T-Mobile is now testing Nougat for the HTC One M9 OnePlus brings Android 7.1.1 to the 3 and 3T Google Nexus 6 owners on Android 7.1.1 get over-the-air ‘downgrade’ to Android 7.0, causing all sorts of issues on their devices Nougat heads to Samsung’s Galaxy S6 and S6 in India Samsung begins Android 7.0 rollout to Galaxy Note5 Earlier this month, Google released its latest monthly Android security updates. Some manufacturers have begun distributing the March patches quickly – but others have not: March security updates now available for Sony’s Xperia X, X Performance, X Compact and XZ AT&T brings February security updates to Samsung Galaxy Note5, Galaxy Note 4 and Galaxy S5 active Samsung (re)commits to monthly security updates for unlocked Galaxy smartphones in the US HMD says it will deliver monthly Android patches to the Nokia 3, 5 and 6 ZTE finally gets around to bringing January updates to its Blade V8 Pro, which was released in February The need for timely security updates was highlighted again this week with yet more Android malware having been discovered. Disturbingly, security researchers at Check Point found that malware had been pre-installed on 38 devices, including some from major manufacturers such as ZTE, Samsung, Lenovo, Xiaomi and ASUS. Samsung’s Galaxy S8 and S8+ will be unveiled later this month, but there may not be much left for the company to announce by then. More details on the new flagships emerged this week: Images leak of Samsung Experience launcher ‘Black Pearl’ model revealed Galaxy S8 might have camera capable of capturing 1000 frames per second China expected to get exclusive S8 model with 6GB RAM Time ran out to develop the Galaxy S8’s on-screen fingerprint scanner Pricing of the new Galaxy Tab S3 was also revealed this week in the UK and US – but the new high-end tablet, which has a Snapdragon 820 chip – won’t come cheap. Also in the UK, Sony’s Xperia XZ Premium, which it unveiled at Mobile World Congress last month, has been priced at £649. After increasing the price of its Windows 10 Mobile flagship in the UK by 7% last week, HP is hoping to tempt people to buy the Elite x3 and Desk Dock by offering them up to £500 to trade in their existing handsets. Unfortunately, owners of Microsoft’s Windows 10 Mobile flagships will only get £125 for their devices. Meanwhile, Microsoft cut the price of the Elite x3 and Desk Dock this week… by 2.4%. Can’t see that making a big difference in boosting sales. Sales of Windows phones have plummeted over the last two years. Industry analysts Kantar Worldpanel wrote off Microsoft’s mobile OS this week, declaring that there’s no hope for a comeback, and that we’re now living in a “two-OS world” as far as the mobile industry goes. Microsoft gave in to that reality a long time ago, bringing more of its software to rival platforms in recent years. It’s made huge improvements to its Arrow Launcher for Android devices over the last few months, adding new support for Android tablets this week. There’s now less than a month until Microsoft ends support for Windows Vista, including security updates. Microsoft has also apparently begun blocking software updates for older versions of Windows running on the newest hardware. Some Windows 7 and 8.1 updates aren’t being offered to PCs running Intel’s latest Kaby Lake (7th-generation) Core processors, along with other new-gen chips, as Microsoft is trying to force encourage users to upgrade to Windows 10. At the same time, Microsoft is now preparing to push through certain Windows 10 updates to devices over metered connections. The company says that it will only do so for “critical fixes” and other “updates required to keep Windows running smoothly”. Microsoft has begun the process of finalizing its Windows 10 Creators Update, ahead of its anticipated release in April. The next step for the company is to select a release candidate which is likely to be distributed to Windows Insiders next week. Microsoft detailed new security improvements in the Creators Update this week, but it also revealed details of features being removed from Windows 10 as part of that update. It’s been a busy week for Windows 10 development, as three new builds rolled out to the Fast ring: 15058, 15060, and on Friday, build 15061. You can find details of the fixes and known issues in build 15061 here. The latest Windows 10 SDK Preview, build 15052, is also available, along with ISOs for build 15058. The latter build is now available on the Windows Insider Slow ring too. Microsoft hasn't yet announced a firm date for the Creators Update's release, so there's plenty of room for speculation! Microsoft released its latest cumulative updates for all versions of Windows 10 on Tuesday, including build 10240.17319 (Version 1507 – the original release of the OS), 10586.839 (Version 1511 – the November Update), and 14393.953 (Version 1607 – the Anniversary Update). However, the latest update for Windows 10 Mobile devices did not include a fix for a rather unpleasant bug that leaves all users’ photos available to view without unlocking a handset. That bug was revealed over a month ago, and yet Microsoft still hasn’t resolved the issue – we checked! Microsoft did fix nine critical security issues in Windows 10 with its latest Patch Tuesday updates though. We don’t yet know exactly when Microsoft plans to announce its second-generation Surface Book, but the device is certainly ripe for replacement. It went on sale almost a year and a half ago, but there are plenty of newer and more capable alternatives available now, including some at lower prices. This week, a report claimed that the new Surface Book 2 will have a more ‘traditional’ laptop form factor, ditching the detachable display of the current model, and thus helping to reduce the cost of the entry-level model by as much as a third, bringing its price down to as little as $1,000. The thing is, that doesn’t make a great deal of sense unless Microsoft plans to differentiate the Surface Book 2 in some other remarkable new way. Surface has always been dedicated to developing new product categories to lead the way for other manufacturers to follow with their own devices. Competing head-on with existing machines by launching a ‘conventional’ notebook would go against the Surface ethos, and would likely do little to help sales of similar laptops from Microsoft’s hardware partners. Over in the UK, Microsoft is continuing to soften the blow of its recent – and massive – price increases on the Surface Book and Surface Pro 4 by extending its offer of free insurance and Office 365, along with new discounts on both devices. The total savings amount to as much as £600. Microsoft has been working with researchers in the UK on a remarkable project, helping visually impaired children to learn coding by using physical, tangible objects. And after several months in preview, Microsoft officially launched its Slack competitor, Teams, in 19 languages and 181 countries across the globe. Microsoft brought its OneDrive app, developed on the Universal Windows Platform, to the Xbox One this week. It also released Xbox Insider Preview build 15058 to the Alpha ring on Friday, bring a new feature along with a single fix, and a long list of known issues. It followed the release of build 15055 to the Alpha ring earlier in the week. Microsoft also revealed that its Alpha Preview of the new Xbox Game Pass will end on April 7. Game Pass is a monthly $10 subscription that will give gamers access to over 100 games, and will launch this Spring. For the first time in two weeks, Microsoft added four more titles to the list of Xbox 360 games that are backward compatible with the Xbox One. It also introduced a new in-game chat transcription feature for the Xbox One and Windows 10, with speech-to-text and text-to-speech support. The US Consumer Product Safety Commission announced a recall of Energizer’s Xbox One 2X Smart Charger, following reports of potentially dangerous overheating on some units. And after releasing its 4.50 system software update for the PlayStation 4 family last week, some owners of Sony’s consoles have reported issues being able to connect to wireless networks. In happier news, Sony announced that it’s expanding its PlayStation Now service to include PS4 games, allowing PC gamers to enjoy those titles on their Windows machines. Nintendo brought a range of indie titles to its new Switch console, which launched earlier this month. But it also emerged that the Switch is vulnerable to a WebKit exploit, demonstrated through a proof-of-concept earlier this week.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 18 March 2017 by Military News 3 Reasons Apple Is a Better Value Stock Than Corning At least at some level, investing can be a lot like a spy novel. A narrative might appear one way at first only to change as new details emerge; things are rarely exactly as they first seem. This idea certainly holds true in comparing tech companies Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Corning (NYSE: GLW) . Trading at roughly half of Apple’s valuation, the superficial numbers would suggest that Corning is clearly the better buy. However, for the three reasons you will see below, the numbers alone fail to tell the entire story. Here’s why Apple is a better value stock to buy today than Corning. 1. Corning isn’t as cheap as it looks The sheer cheapness of its stock jumps out immediately when looking at Corning. At a time when the S&P 500 trades at roughly 26 times earnings — admittedly well above its own historic norms — Corning stock currently trades hands at a minuscule 8.5 times earnings. However, this also contains an important investing lesson: Stocks tend to trade at such seemingly preposterous discounts for a reason. Case in point: Corning booked a $2.6 billion gain on the revaluation of one of its equity investments during its fiscal 2016, which inflated its pre-tax income by roughly 190% on the year. With its earnings per share (EPS) expect to grow at 8% this year, Corning’s 15.3 forward P/E ratio serves as a far better indicator of the company’s actual valuation than its current P/E. Again, the alarm bells should go off any time you see the shares of a healthy company like Corning trading at so seemingly cheap a valuation. Corning isn’t nearly as cheap as it appears at first glance. Image source: Apple. 2. Apple is cheaper than it looks Just as Corning isn’t as cheap as it looks, the value of Apple’s core operating business is actually far lower than its P/E suggests. The underlying reason is fairly well documented at this point; Apple’s net cash surplus totaled $158.6 billion in its most recent quarterly filing. Subtracting this staggering figure from Apple’s market capitalization reduces its valuation to $570.6 billion. Using this net-cash-adjusted market cap as the numerator to Apple’s P/E ratio provides an updated valuation for the Mac maker of just 12.6 times earnings, which is significantly lower than Corning’s valuation metric after removing the effect of the one-time accounting gains it recorded this year. Seen this way, Apple actually offers investors better value, though this line of reasoning does little to factor in either company’s growth outlook. However, the investment thesis turns even more in Apple’s favor upon adding in the companies’ long-term return profiles. 3. Apple’s growth outlook beats Corning’s Not to belabor the point, but comparing Apple’s forward growth rates against those of Corning supports the same conclusion. Looking to the top line, consensus Wall Street estimates call for Apple to increase its sales by 5.9% this year and 7.5% next year. Meanwhile, Corning is expected to see its sales rise 3.4% in 2016 and 1.2% in 2017. The same relationship — Apple slightly outgrowing Corning — also applies to sell-side estimates for the two companies’ earnings per share. Much of this is likely attributable to Apple’s expected debut of a fully redesigned 10th anniversary iPhone this fall. Corning, of course, will benefit from Apple’s latest iPhone as a component supplier for the handset. However, Apple will certainly benefit far more from the highly anticipated device. Beyond sales and earnings growth, Apple’s gigantic — and growing — cash surplus gives the company far more flexibility to enhance overall shareholder returns through increased dividends and buybacks. The company can also invest heavily in future growth initiatives like electric cars or digital streaming content without affecting its current earnings outlook. At the end of the day, although Corning is no slouch in its own right, Apple is clearly the better value stock between the two companies. 10 stocks we like better than Apple When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Casey | March 14, 2017 08:13 am MORE We're seeing more smoke coming from the iPad rumor mill, with the latest reinforcing the notion that Apple will be introducing a new version of the iPad Pro. According to a new report, the company's upcoming 10.5-inch iPad Pro will launch in April, slightly later than the March window we've heard previously. This updated launch date comes from Taiwanese news site DigiTimes, which reports that the 10.5-inch slate will be unveiled at a "product event to be held in early April to mark the inauguration of Apple's new headquarters in California." MORE: Our Favorite Tablets for Work and Play This is the first we're hearing of an Apple Park opening event, though an Apple press release released in February notes that the campus will be ready for employees in April. Where such an event would be held on-campus, specifically, is up in the air. The location's events auditorium, dubbed the Steve Jobs Theater, isn't expected to open until "later this year." The Steve Jobs Theater, an event auditorium where Apple may be revealing its next iPad. The new 10.5-inch iPad Pro is expected bear a striking new design with an almost borderless display and no home button, which makes it sound an awful lot like one of the new iPhones expected this year. This kind of overhaul could provide the wow-factor that the high-end corner of the tablet market needs to open its wallets up again. We're also expecting to see Apple give more modest refreshes to its 9.7-inch and 12.3-inch iPad Pro tablets. The company may also launch a 7.9-inch model and give it one of Apple's smart connectors, so that it can attach to a Smart Keyboard, just like an iPad Pro. Stay tuned to Laptop Mag for all the iPad rumors, news and announcements, as we're keeping our eyes out for Apple's next tablets. ✖ iPad Pro Tips and Tricks Multitask on the iPad Pro Every iPad Pro Keyboard Shortcut You'll Ever Need Use the iOS Keyboard as a Touchpad Display Two Safari Tabs Simultaneously on the iPad Pro How to Use the Apple Pencil with iPad Pro's Notes App Edit Multiple Streams of 4K Video on the iPad Pro Use Your iPad Pro as a Secondary Display Check the Apple Pencil’s Battery Life Use Your iPhone as a Hotspot for the iPad Pro Multitask on the iPad Pro Every iPad Pro Keyboard Shortcut You'll Ever Need Use the iOS Keyboard as a Touchpad Display Two Safari Tabs Simultaneously on the iPad Pro How to Use the Apple Pencil with iPad Pro's Notes App Edit Multiple Streams of 4K Video on the iPad Pro Use Your iPad Pro as a Secondary Display Check the Apple Pencil’s Battery Life Use Your iPhone as a Hotspot for the iPad Pro Next Tips »» «« Previous Tip Next Tip »» iPad Pro Tips and Tricks Multitask on the iPad Pro Every iPad Pro Keyboard Shortcut You'll Ever Need Use the iOS Keyboard as a Touchpad More Tips Multitask on the iPad Pro Every iPad Pro Keyboard Shortcut You'll Ever Need Use the iOS Keyboard as a Touchpad Display Two Safari Tabs Simultaneously on the iPad Pro How to Use the Apple Pencil with iPad Pro's Notes App Edit Multiple Streams of 4K Video on the iPad Pro Use Your iPad Pro as a Secondary Display Check the Apple Pencil’s Battery Life Use Your iPhone as a Hotspot for the iPad Pro Author Bio Henry T.

Apple had their time in the sun, they decided to keep regurgitating the same product over and over again and slapping a higher number and an "i" in front of it. I doubt this will garner the sales that Apple thinks it will. Their last "innovation"?...the Touchbar?...didn't bring sales up like they should have, lets see how hight things go with this.

Home News National Pressure on Apple to pay tax in NZ Author Simon Collins, Section National, Publish Date Saturday, 18 March 2017, 5:42PM Apple is the biggest taxpayer in the US but paid zero tax in NZ in the past decade American-based Apple users are weighing in behind Kiwi politicians who are calling for the US tech giant to pay its taxes in New Zealand. Bryan Chaffin of The Mac Observer, an Apple community blog site founded in 1998, has urged Apple chief executive Tim Cook to "do the right thing" even though it would mean slightly lower profits for the company's shareholders. He was commenting on revelations today in the Weekend Herald that Apple paid zero tax to the NZ Government in the past 10 years in a period when its sales in this country totalled $4.2 billion. The company's accounts show that its NZ branch paid $37 million in tax since 2007 - but all of it was passed on to the Australian Government because the NZ operation is run out of Australia. Chaffin wrote that Apple was the largest taxpayer in the United States, but "pays next to nothing in most parts of the world". "There are so many areas where Apple does enormous good - far, far more good than any other electronics giant, and probably any other for-profit company," he wrote. "But local taxes matter. Roads matter. Schools matter. Housing authorities matter. Health care matters. Regulation enforcement matters. All of the things that support civil society matter. Apple's profits are made possible by that civil society, and the company should contribute its fair share. "According to the New Zealand Herald, 'Had Apple reported the same healthy profit margin in New Zealand as it did for its operations globally it would have paid $356 million in taxes over the period. "That kind of money matters to countries the size of New Zealand. To me, Apple should kick in to help pay for the civil infrastructure it needs to make those profits. "And I won't be silent about it." Labour's revenue spokesman Michael Wood said Kiwi taxpayers had "every reason to feel outraged" by Apple's zero NZ tax bill. "Nurses, cleaners, office workers, and small business owners, who pay their fair share of tax to support public services in our country, will be dismayed at these latest revelations," he said. "We know that this is the tip of the iceberg for big multinationals being let off the hook by the National Government being completely asleep at the wheel." The Government announced a package of measures on March 3 which will deem non-residents to have NZ permanent establishments if they sell goods or services to a person in New Zealand, and have related entities carrying out activities here to bring the sales about. The package will also stop companies using interest payments to shift profits offshore. But it stops short of a diverted profits tax which has been introduced in Australia and Britain. Revenue Minister Judith Collins declined to comment specifically on Apple yesterday, but said a "minority" of international companies were exploiting rules to avoiding paying tax and "we do not consider the amount of tax paid by these multinationals is fair". An Apple spokesperson in Australia told the Herald yesterday: "Apple aims to be a force for good and we're proud of the contributions we've made in New Zealand over the past decade. Because our products and services are created, designed and engineered in the US, that's where the vast majority of our tax is paid." - NZ Herald Related Technology: 7 November Technology: 7 November Technology: 3 October Technology: 3 October Technology: 26 September Technology: 26 September Opinion Rachel Smalley: Nia Glassie's abuser can't be allowed to...

Instead, Apple responded by saying it paid most of its tax in the United States, where the company was based. Apple claims to be the largest taxpayer in the world, but a report says New Zealand got none of it. Photo: AFP A New Zealand Herald investigation found Apple paid no local tax in the last decade, despite selling $4.2 billion worth of products in New Zealand in that time. The government has refused to comment on the report. In a statement today, Apple did not say whether it had paid tax in New Zealand since 2007. Apple said it was the largest taxpayer in the world and followed the law in every country in which it operated. The company said it aimed to be a force for good and was proud of the contributions it made in New Zealand. Revenue Minister Judith Collins said earlier she could not comment on individual cases, but there was a minority of multinationals that tried to reduce their taxes. She said that was unfair and she was working to strengthen the tax rules. Revenue Minister Judith Collins. Photo: RNZ / Claire Eastham-Farrelly Untasted Apple shows govt 'too slow' on tax - Labour The Labour Party made calls for greater transparency over how multinationals conduct their tax affairs. Labour revenue spokesperson Michael Wood argued there was no reason Apple should avoid public scrutiny. "If we do have these large multinational companies who, on the basis of pretty good evidence, are potentially avoiding their tax, they don't actually have the same rights to absolute privacy about that as an ordinary individual who might be under investigation," he said. He said the government had been too slow to act on closing loopholes. "Every single tax expert who looks at this says 'yep, our current system allows for this', he said. "So Apple hasn't been doing anything illegal, they've exploiting loopholes in the tax laws that we've known about for years." Mr Wood promised greater transparency for the tax affairs of overseas corporations if Labour were to win this year's general election.

The analysts said the information is from its own sources and not based on other reports. The research firm did not disclose which products it expects Apple to announce, but rumors have widely suggested at least a trio of new iPad Pro models will be unveiled as early as this month, including an all-new 10.5-inch model with slimmer bezels and updated 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch versions. The sources expecting an iPad refresh include, among others, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Barclays analyst Blayne Curtis, and Japanese blog Mac Otakara. The last of the three expects a new 7.9-inch model that would supplant the iPad mini 4, but other reports deny or fail to mention that particular claim. Last month, Mac Otakara said Apple will host a March event where it will debut its new iPad Pro lineup, a larger iPhone SE model with 128GB storage, and new Apple Watch bands. The report also claimed Apple will add a red color option for iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, which could be part of (PRODUCT)RED. Apple has yet to invite the media to an event this month, however, and those invites would be on shorter notice than usual if it is indeed planning to announce new products this way as early as next week. In each of the past two years, Apple invited the media to its March event roughly 11-12 days beforehand, including February 26 invites for a March 9 event in 2015 and March 10 invites for a March 21 event last year. There are three plausible scenarios if new products are in the cards: Apple is planning a March event, and invites will go out soon; Apple is planning a Spring event, but not this month; or Apple will share its announcements through a press release as it did when it dropped the price of the fourth-generation iPad to $399 in March 2014. A few reports have suggested the 10.5-inch iPad Pro could face shipping delays, so perhaps Apple will delay announcing it entirely. Apple has hosted March events four times in the past six years. In 2011 and 2012, it introduced new iPad models at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts. In 2015, it revealed Apple Watch pricing and release date information. Last year, Apple debuted the 9.7-inch iPad Pro and iPhone SE at its Town Hall. One rumor suggested Apple could be planning an event on April 4, but this date was based on Personal Pickup for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, which is generally not a reliable indicator of an event. The in-store pickup date for 12.9-inch iPad Pro models is a rolling target, as evidenced by the April 10 date now shown. The all-new 10.5-inch iPad Pro is expected to have slimmer bezels, and possibly no Home button, allowing it to have the same overall footprint as the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. This design could foreshadow the rumored 5.8-inch iPhone. The tablet is also rumored to have a higher-resolution display and quad microphones. The updated 12.9-inch iPad Pro is said to feature a 12-megapixel rear camera and True Tone display like the current 9.7-inch model, using advanced four-channel ambient light sensors to automatically adapt the color and intensity of the display to match the light in the surrounding environment.

Registered developers can download the sixth iOS 10.3 beta from the Apple Developer Center or over-the-air with the proper configuration profile installed. iOS 10.3 is a major update, introducing significant new features and changes to the iOS 10 operating system. The biggest consumer-facing feature in iOS 10.3 is "Find My AirPods," which is designed to help AirPods owners locate a lost earphone. Find My AirPods records the last known location of when an AirPod was connected to an iOS device via Bluetooth and can play a sound on a lost AirPod. Apple's latest update also introduces a new Apple File System (APFS), installed when an iOS device is updated to iOS 10.3. APFS is optimized for flash/SSD storage and includes features like strong encryption. Apple plans to introduce some App Store changes in iOS 10.3, allowing developers to respond to customer reviews for the first time. iOS users are also able to label reviews in the App Store as "Helpful" or "Not Helpful," which should help surface the most relevant review content. Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel for more videos. Apple also plans to limit the number of times developers can ask for a review, allow customers to leave app reviews without exiting an app, and provide a "master switch" that will let users turn off all app review request prompts. Also new in iOS 10.3 is a redesigned app open/close animation, an Apple ID profile in Settings, a better breakdown of iCloud storage usage, warnings about outdated apps that won't work with future versions of iOS, HomeKit support for programmable light switches, improvements to SiriKit (bill paying, bill status, and scheduling future rides), CarPlay interface improvements, iCloud analytics options, and more. Update: iOS 10.3 beta 6 is also available for public beta testers.

But then again my comment was on the article and the comment the author pointed out that the biggest consumer update was to be able to find Airpods. So if anyone doesn't have Airpods....The current update is pretty invisible. HA ok. According to just that statement, I guess. Not sure I would deem the importance of an iOS update on what a MacRumors blogger posted but I suppose the find airpods is the most obvious change. Perhaps that's why the author focused on that. So if you don't care about bug fixes, security updates, performance optimizations, additional usable space on your device, CarPlay enhancements, Maps/Weather data enhancements and the the rest of the list of changes included in this update then yeah pretty uneventful I guess you could say. But then again it IS a point update not a new iOS major version. Rating: 2 Votes yockster 1 week ago Somebody woke up early today. Or they forgot it was daylight savings time, lol.

DigiTimes previously said the 10.5-inch iPad Pro would not be available until May or June, but now claims Apple has "moved ahead the production" of the rumored tablet. Over the past few weeks, we've heard a lot of speculation about when Apple will debut the 10.5-inch iPad Pro and its sister tablet(s). Rumors originally suggested the company would hold an event in March, but that has been in question as it is nearly mid-month with no hint of an event. Earlier today, a reliable supply chain source told MacRumors that Apple would announce products later this month, likely between Monday, March 20 and Friday, March 24. There was also a rumor circulating suggesting Apple would hold an event on April 4, but that was incorrectly based on an erroneous interpretation of Personal Pickup dates for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro. While we haven't yet nailed down a specific timeline for the unveiling of new iPads, the prospective launch window is narrowing and rumors suggest we're going to see them within the next month. Just today, new iPad models were spotted in device logs gathered by Fiksu, suggesting a release is indeed on the horizon. Fiksu, like our unnamed supply chain source and DigiTimes, believes a launch is imminent. If an event takes place in April, it could potentially be held at Apple's new campus, Apple Park, but there's one snag in that plan. Apple is going to open the campus in April, but the company's press release said the auditorium where events will be held, now dubbed the Steve Jobs Theater, will open "later this year." The wording makes it unclear if the theater will be ready for Apple Park's grand opening, and thus ready for an event. According to today's report from DigiTimes, Apple plans to target the education and business sectors with both the rumored 10.5-inch iPad and a refreshed 12.9-inch model, which the site says will be Apple's "mainstream products" for the mid-tier to high-end tablet market in 2017. While DigiTimes believes the 10.5-inch iPad Pro will now see an April debut, the site says the production schedule for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro "still remains unclear" with volume production perhaps delayed until May or June. Rumors suggest that the new 12.9-inch iPad will feature a modest refresh, but the 10.5-inch model is rumored to have a nearly bezel-free edge-to-edge display and a body that's actually the same size as the existing 9.7-inch iPad Pro. There have also been rumors suggesting Apple plans to release a lower-end 9.7-inch iPad Pro and a 7.9-inch model, but whether those rumors are true remains to be seen as the focus has mainly been on Apple's larger upcoming tablets.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile ‘iPad mini Pro’ is reportedly one of the four new iPad Pros launching soon Chris Smith @chris_writes March 15th, 2017 at 7:53 AM Share Tweet Apple is expected to launch a slew of new iPads in the coming weeks, and it’s all going down at what may be the first press conference to be held at Apple’s shiny new Apple Campus headquarters. A new report indicates that Apple is about to unveil four new iPad models, and all of them will get the “Pro” moniker, even the brand new iPad mini. Don't Miss: The Galaxy S8 and Note 8 might not even be the best phones Samsung unveils this year Greek site TechValue says it’s able to confirm that four new iPad models are coming, including the iPad Pro 2 in 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch flavors, a 10.5-inch iPad Pro, and a brand new iPad mini Pro. With the 10.5-inch iPad Pro, Apple will introduce a new iPad size in its lineup. The 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch versions will also be upgraded. The report notes that the iPads will come in 32GB, 128GB, and 256GB versions, similar to what’s available in Apple’s iPhone 7 lineup. The tablets will be available in Space Grey, Silver, Gold, and Rose Gold. According to Phone Arena, the new 10.5-inch and 12.9-inch iPads will feature Apple’s A10X chip inside, while the new 9.7-inch iPad Pro 2 will have an A9 processor. Earlier this week, a report from mobile marketing firm Fiksu revealed that Apple has been testing four new iPad models around Cupertino. The devices were spotted in analytics logs, TechCrunch explains, all the way back in September, but sightings increased in January and February.

He provides unique big picture analysis of the complex world of Microsoft. Jason takes the small clues and gives you an insightful big picture perspective through storytelling that you won't find anywhere else. Seriously, this dude thinks outside the box. Follow him on Twitter at @JLTechWord. He's doing the "write" thing! I recently read an interesting article by respected writer and analyst Walt Mossberg, who said the PC is being redefined. I agree. But ... I've described the evolving personal computing landscape in the past. To communicate an accurate picture of the modern personal computing environment and the influencing factors that have shaped it, I've acknowledged that it's impossible to ignore the impact of the iPhone. Though smartphones existed before the iPhone, those business-focused devices were not relevant to the masses. The iPhone, with its "massive" touch screen merged the iPod, a phone and an internet device, and redefined the smartphone. Consumers loved it as much as they loved the popular iPod that primed them for a pocketable consumer-focused smartphone from Apple. Eventually, the iPhone and the "there's-an-app-for-that" model, which made it a veritable "swiss-army mobile computing device," evolved into much more than the phone-iPod-internet device introduced by former Apple CEO Steve Jobs in 2007. In time, Apple's introduction of the iPhone had a profound effect on the personal computing landscape. The iPhone, Android phones and to a lesser extent Windows phones — all with their supporting app ecosystems, integrated services, always-connected nature and pocketability — supplanted the traditional PC as the most used personal computers. Yes, smartphones are personal computing devices. Microsoft, not Apple, is more instrumental to the evolution of the PC. I agree with Mossberg that the mobile computing environment and ecosystems that shape personal computing today are influencers on what the PC will ultimately be. However, I disagree with his assessment that a significant shift to the new type of ARM-based PC that runs mobile apps will be determined by Apple. Millions of consumers already buy laptops that use "mobile apps" Microsoft's Universal Windows Platform (UWP) and Windows 10 laptops and 2-in-1s have already begun the process of bringing consumers to a laptop form factor that runs mobile apps, as well as traditional apps. This computing environment will be brought to ARM processors, as ARM-based Windows 10 PCs begin rolling out in several months. The change to an ARM-based system will be largely transparent to users. What won't be transparent are the advantages of ARM-based cellular Windows 10 PCs. Among other advantages, consumers will reap the benefits of lower costs, and lighter, fan-less and more power-efficient Windows 10 PCs. Mossberg said the following of a shift to ARM in relation to this problem: But the signs of a shift to ARM only set the stage for a bigger development: The migration of the most important modern software platforms, Android and iOS, to laptops and other traditional hardware that once defined the old kind of PC. ... I believe it won't matter much until Apple builds an ARM-based laptop running iOS. Here's why. Microsoft ... does have a modern breed of multi-touch apps that work properly on a tablet or clamshell screen, and some are included on every Windows tablet and laptop. Unfortunately, partly because Microsoft has no smartphone business to speak of, it also lacks a critical mass of these new-style apps and, even on its tablets, relies instead on classic Windows apps. Apple, by contrast, boasts 1.3 million tablet-optimized apps for the iPad, and these could presumably easily run on a small laptop with a built-in keyboard and touchscreen. This is more than a small advantage; it's the reason people might buy this type of device instead of a traditional laptop. I agree with the general assessments Mossberg puts forth. I also see the value in his conclusion that Apple, because of its vast and appealing app ecosystem, occupies an influential position. Consumer love for iOS apps may be a sufficient motivating factor for the masses to consciously and deliberately choose to use a laptop running those same mobile apps. That's if Apple can deliver a good mouse-and-keyboard productivity experience. Can Apple generate interest in a laptop that runs only mobile apps? I put forth a similar analysis in relation to Google's position if it ever decided to merge Chrome and Android. Google's 80 percent dominance of the mobile market would be a real threat to Microsoft's 90 percent dominance in PCs if Google brought a viable desktop experience to a desktop environment. Microsoft already invented the universal app 'wheel' Apple needs iOS apps are optimized for a slate consumption-based experience, not a peripheral-enhanced productivity setting. Mossberg stated the following in relation to this problem: The definition of a PC, a personal computer, is already undergoing a profound change. A great laptop running the new kinds of user interfaces and apps that people now love on phones and tablets would be a big, exciting event that would help seal the deal. But there hasn't yet been a product that emphatically suggests the era of the traditional PC is fading. And it feels like an opportunity only Apple can seize. Microsoft's Windows 10 and Universal Platform with Continuum are driving the evolution of the PC while also keeping the traditional PC around. Rather than just a clamshell laptop that runs mobile apps, which is Mossberg's vision for an evolved PC, Microsoft's strategy is more comprehensive. Microsoft's PC vision is more comprehensive than mobile apps on a laptop. Redmond saw the coming shift and created a device form factor with the Surface, a context-sensitive OS in Windows 10 and a Universal Platform that provides a common core for all device types and app development. The research firm IDC said the following, confirming the success and adoption of Windows laptops and 2-in-1s in a recent report: Consumers are just starting to graduate from old, consumption-based, slate tablets to a more productive detachable tablet. At the same time, the benefits of having a thin, touch-sensitive, productivity-based machine is [sic] shining light on the traditional PC category, causing vendors and consumers to focus on more premium devices in the Convertible and Ultraslim space. As the tablet market works through the challenges of a maturing user base, the notebook ecosystem has seen success in assimilating a more mobile experience to the form factor while retaining its inherent superiority in the content creation arena, which remains critical for commercial buyers. Absent major external forces, IDC believes the notebook and traditional PC market overall will see relatively stable volumes with some growth in more mobile designs offset by declines in less mobile products. As we watch the unfolding of Microsoft's strategy with the industry's embrace of 2-in-1s, Windows 10 laptops and PCs and Windows Mixed Reality (formerly Windows Holographic), Microsoft's impact on the evolution of the PC, in all of its forms, obviously exceeds Apple's. Technologically, Microsoft is where Mossberg hopes Apple will get Mossberg states, "Apple … boasts 1.3 million tablet-optimized apps for the iPad, and these could presumably easily run on a small laptop with a built-in keyboard and touchscreen." He supplies the caveat "presumably" in acknowledgment of his (and all of our) uncertainty as to the viability of iOS apps running on a small laptop with a built-in keyboard (and mouse). iOS apps are not yet optimized for a laptop environment. By contrast, we know with full certainty that Microsoft's unique UWP allows Windows Store apps to run on phones, laptops, 2-in-1s, HoloLens, Xbox, desktop PCs and any as yet to be created Windows devices. Most Windows 10 devices also run Win32 apps in conjunction with Store apps, and Windows 10 on ARM may bring that ability to phones. What Mossberg speculates would be a technological advancement for the Apple ecosystem already exists in far greater depth and breadth as part of Microsoft's UWP. Mossberg's vision of an evolved PC is a laptop with iOS apps and only iOS apps. Microsoft's personal computer vision is far broader than that. Windows 10 is key to the modern PC Though Windows 10 is only running on 400 million devices, Windows is a desktop and mobile platform. In less than two years, though far below it's one billion devices target, 400 million devices is impressive. iOS and Android have had roughly a decade to reach the billion mark those OSes achieved. Windows 10 is an evolution of the OS that embraces mobile computing. Some may argue that Windows 10 is merely an upgrade to the Windows OS that has a billion installed base. It is actually more of an evolution toward a new type of OS that retains the legacy strengths of the traditional desktop while adopting the necessary attributes of the modern, mobile personal computing environment. Universal Windows Apps, along with the coming full Windows on ARM and CShell on all types of mobile devices, help us visualize this reality. When viewing it from that proper perspective, the unique unified desktop and mobile OS that is Windows 10 has already begun to achieve in a very real way what Mossberg anticipates will be achieved with Android and iOS: bringing a relevant "mobile" OS to a desktop clamshell form factor. The market is buying, but may not "buy into" Microsoft's vision The PC's transformation, based on Windows 10 2-in-1s and even laptops, has already been accepted in the market by OEMs and consumers. Mossberg's vision awaits a move from Apple to create wide acceptance for what the success of Windows 2-in-1s is already achieving: market-wide acceptance of a laptop (or 2-in-1) OS that runs mobile apps. The Windows Store on a Windows 10 desktop has thousands of universal apps that work across various form factors, including mobile. I concede that the success of the Windows Store is not on par with Microsoft's goals. Moreover, the implementation of a Windows-based smartphone has not met commercial success. Consequently, though there are thousands of universal apps that are compatible beyond the mobility of a laptop or 2-in-1 form factor, and that work on a phone, the number is dwarfed by the number of iOS apps in the App Store. So yes, the popularity of iOS apps, if somehow made to work as efficiently in a mouse-and-keyboard laptop form factor, would produce more of a "conscious" decision by consumers to seek out or inquire about such a device. These consumers may be motivated by a desire to use the mobile apps they're familiar with from their iPhones, on a laptop-like device. PC consumers are likely not motivated by an opportunity to experience Store apps. By contrast, the universal apps that are part of Microsoft's proliferating "evolving PC" vision and that are also available to users who buy Windows 10 2-in-1s and laptops are in many cases likely just "along for the ride." Candidly speaking, these user purchases are likely less motivated by the opportunity to experience universal apps and their benefits than by the productivity legacy of Window PCs, even as manifest in modern touch-enabled laptops and 2-in-1s. The Windows Store's underperformance is likely one of the motivating factors in Microsoft's increasingly aggressive advertising efforts in Windows 10. It needs to get users that have embraced the new OS and evolving PC form-factors to also embrace the ecosystem that they exist within. Apple, with the popularity of iOS apps, but the lack of a truly universal platform akin to the UWP, and the efficient productivity environment that Windows 10 PCs bring mobile apps, would have the exact opposite challenge. Microsoft's impact on PC evolution is both deep and broad Ultimately, I agree with Mossberg's conclusion from a consumer perspective. That is, if Microsoft cannot draw developers and consumers to its modern app ecosystem, Apple may be more successful in drawing consumer "attention" to the concept of a mobile-app-focused laptop. That's if Apple invests in and successfully creates an iOS-based laptop, which the famously secretive company has made no indication of doing. I do, however, believe that Mossberg may be underestimating the industry impact Microsoft's Windows 10 and UWP has had, and is currently having, on the evolution of the PC, in the form of touch-sensitive laptops, 2-in-1s and other devices like HoloLens that run universal apps. Mossberg may be underestimating Microsoft's impact on the PC's evolution. OEM's, consumers, businesses, and various industries have greatly embraced these "modern," evolved PCs. As Microsoft's partners begin bringing ARM-based cellular PCs to market in several months, that impact will be even more evident than it is now. In truth, Apple's mimicry of the Surface with the iPad Pro is indicative of its reactive, or follower's role, in the PC's evolution. The evolution is well underway. Microsoft is driving it, and its plan goes even further than Mossberg's vision of mobile apps on a laptop form factor.

Hopefully as you read the piece you saw the section where I elaborated on the failure of (UWA) Store apps to be embraced by consumers and developers. If you failed to read it, you will find it under the subtitle, "The market is buying, but may not "buy into" Microsoft's vision. Also the piece isn't "about" the UWP, but about Microsoft's impact on the redefinition of the PC. As such the rebuttal to Mossberg's article (this piece) necessitated the addressing of the UWP as part of the narrative. To intentionally exclude that would have painted an incomplete picture. Again, glad you're still here.👍🏿 2 4 days ago Reply ED the new guy Congratulations and thank you. You eloquently rebutted my unfair post. Now I am compelled to read your article properly :). +1 0 3 days ago Reply Poorer-Richard Funny... I'm oldschool enough to remember that once, Bill Gates thought that the future for MS was entertainment content! I also agree that MS will define the future of PC computing for some time to come. Apple, by contrast, went the route of non-stop upgrades and rollouts for the generations they assume will always have no issue paying $500 plus for a fancy communications device, every year. Their hardware vision is pure marketing. Meanwhile, as fun as it is, the world has changed, security wise, and now not even Apple owners are safe from hackers and virus infections. In addition, inb my mind, the continuing safe state of Cloud Computing remains viable as long as the servers can keep moving constantly to avoid detection. I still prefer to store my own data on a local drive. I can secure it myself, and shut it down overnight, etc. But then, I come out of a DIY culture and distrust anything I can't take-apart, fix and reassemble. I've built our home and business systems since the i286, and appreciate the more affordable, egalitarian approach to operating systems and hardware design that MS has given the PC World. MS has had several misfires, like most companies, but they manage to rise again, as have some of the underdog hardware manufacturers like AMD (my own preferred processor, BTW...). I think Windows will be running on all kinds of machines for a long time to come. 0 4 days ago Reply VITNE Maybe Microsoft needs to stop calling them apps and go back to calling them programs. Before iPhone, I never heard anyone say "I just got this new computer app." It was always the word "program." It may seem silly, but "app" sounds mobile and weak and "program" sounds powerful. Maybe call the Windows Store the "Windows Software Store" "app" became the buzzword after iPhone took off. Now everyone associates apps with mobile. Seeing as how MS is marrying the mobile side and desktop side with things like Continuum, maybe they need to think about word associations and the mentality behind them. Maybe just switching to the terms "software" and "program" will put the power of Windows back in people's minds, regardless of form factor. 2 4 days ago Reply ED the new guy The genie is out of the bottle. People have tasted a world not dominated by Microsoft and it's working for them. Microsoft missed the boat when they failed to challenge Chrome on the desktop and iOS and then Android in the mobile device sphere. These two operating systems have wrested a whole generation away from Microsoft's sphere of influence. Chrome's success with HTML 5 on the desktop has allowed a whole generation to become platform agnostic. And, it's also taken a substantial chunk out of previous generations. Web services are where the <30 crowd is at, and, the operating system that gives access to those services is irrelevant. You can just as easily run Chrome on a stripped down single purpose Linux OS as you can on a full blown Windows OS and still get 100% of the experience. You can easily switch between Mac OS X, Windows, Android and iOS because the experience is mediated by HTML 5! PS App is the new program. I now on the verge of needing bifocals and I have a hard time keeping app and program straight. People who aren't techies don't know the difference. To them an app is a program. Besides, app is a good short form for application. To me application is program that the user uses to perform tasks. A program is simply a piece of compiled code. It could be part of the OS or part of an application but does not in and of itself directly useful to the user. 0 4 days ago Reply md2boys This is all great, but lets get on with it.  I have been waiting for a new Microsoft Mobile device for some time now.  The HP is nice, but I'd like ot see the new Surface mobile I keep reading about.  What's taking so long, my Nokia 1520 is getting old and needs to be replaced!!! 0 4 days ago Reply Tom French2 With 10 still in a flux state improving with every update it is only a matter of time before the store apps will improve.  Right now the consumer drives the iOS and Android platforms in the mobile environment but when mobile in Windows is fully implemented then it may not completely catch up but I believe will gain some ground on the others.  They too are now being forced to rethink what they are doing because of Microsoft and Windows 10.  While what they have is nice to use I still don't like the appearance of their start screens or the lack of flexibility they do not have that Windows does in mobile.  If Satya had been in charge of Microsoft 2 years earlier we would be talking a much different mobile platform already.  The mobile platform would be a much larger share of the market than it is now.  0 4 days ago Reply AgentTheGreat "A matter of time"...yes.

I'm sorry, but for many of us 30+ year veterans (how's that for getting around the old folks label) Mr. Mossberg will forever be the Apple acolyte that Steve jobs would tell things to that he wouldn't even trust with his own family. Everything appears through an Apple lens for him. I'm not saying he is necessarily wrong, as he is on to something with the transition to touch screen mobile devices, but like the current Apple leader, can't get past the toaster+refrigerator metaphor.  0 4 days ago Reply Viktar H This won't work. Microsoft and Nadella are not interested in Windows 10 and UWP. No resources are being invested here. And effectively nobody uses UWP apps on desktops and laptops (they are primitive and extremely buggy). See EDGE market share as an example. And Microsof is zero in IOT And in cars. And in mobile space. And even Cortana is outdated and sees no development efforts behind it for years. There IS a potential, but MS will leave consumer space for Google and Apple and will move to the server side of things. 0 4 days ago Reply ar-7 I think it will be interesting to see what Microsoft, Apple, and Google does over the next few years. Each have their own challenges when it comes to redefining the modern PC. For Microsoft it's the legacy of the PC. Not just with developers ignoring the UWP but having to cater Windows to legacy desktop users. Apple's challenge is the money. They make money from selling hardware. Tim Cook keeps his job by increasing shareholder value. They have a strong interest in keeping the iPad as a third device and not trully challenging the Mac. It's why they emphasized hardware accessories with the iPad Pro and not so much the software. Google lacks the focus to lead this, imo. They have done little, imo, to make Android or apps tablet friendly. I really like the Chromebook concept but I don't think they will push that enough to really compete with what Microsoft is doing. 0 4 days ago Reply Sparkxster Google is already doing this with Chromebooks bringing chrome os and Android together.

Glad to see ms filling their shoes. 1 5 days ago Reply Awhispersecho 1st of all, why does everyone act like Apple is dominating every market? Whether it's TV, tech sites, or companies who make money evaluating the tech industry, they all act like Apple is dominating everything. This is a company that has 14% mobile marketshare and 4% PC marketshare. Just because they are worth a fortune due to using older, lesser technology while charging more for it, doesn't mean they are dominating. It just means they are making their investors happy. Secondly, Apple was never innovative and neither was Steve Jobs. They have never invented anything, they never created a "new" product. They have always taken an existing product and made it look better and usually work better. That's great but it doesn't make you innovative. And Steve Jobs wasn't anything he has been made out to be. He was an ass, a selfish jerk. He was a guy who screwed over old partners, who refused to acknowledge his own daughter was his for years. He was a guy didn't want apps on the iPhone and almost shut down the whole iPad project because ge didn't like the tone of white they were using. He was the guy who said good companies copy, great companies steal and are proud of it. Having said all that, I have zero faith in MS to do anything right at this point. Even if they do things right, they will be 2 years too late and then they will have to start over again. They have painted themselves into a corner that they will not be able to get out of. Dropping Mobile was a huge mistake. They won't survive another 10 years in the consumer space. They will be enterprise only within 5 years except for Xbox which will be sold off. They can thank a combination of incompetence and Nadella for that.

"PC makers and consumers have embraced Microsoft's PC vision." Have they?  Have they really?  They're only buying what's available.  Referencing a quote a record industry zealot once made to me when questioned about producers and artists' inability to record without incurring costs due to the record label pyramid beholden to the legal ASCAP/SESAC/BMI cartel that keeps him fat and warm - he said "Don't conflate spending with free will.  You're eventually only going to have two terrible choices that will cost you more than you can afford but can't bring effect to the world without it."  He made this comment with regard to the costs producers and artists have to incur due to the cartel instead of just playing music on the sidewalk because they love the art so much no matter where they can express themselves.  What does that have to do with Microsoft's vision?  If people want or need to use a computer, do PC makers and consumers really have a realistic option to not use Microsoft-based hardware other than using the very fragmented GNU/Linux universe on the "modern" PC or (for users) without going broke in buying Apple's underperforming, overpriced junk that Microsoft is basically endorsing by overpricing its underperforming, overpriced junk (this one's for you, Surface Book and Studio)?  The only "modern" PC options people have are within the context of a virtual duopoly with little to no competition (except a trace from Linux) in meeting "modern" PC users where they are. "Among other advantages, consumers will reap the benefits of lower costs, and lighter, fan-less and more power-efficient Windows 10 PCs." There is no evidence whatsoever in the recent history of computing of ARM leading to any of what you are claiming "will" happen.  The prices of ARM-based devices are ever increasing without merit.  Most willing buyers are young and few of them have their own PC because they don't want PCs.  They'd only be potential upgraders to still-inadequate-for-actual-computing ARM-based Windows 10 cellular devices, which will only cost more than what those young users currently have that already do more than enough. 2 5 days ago Reply tomworthjr Microsoft is 95% there with the Surface Book's trackpad and keyboard (actually, 99% there on the keyboard and 90% on the trackpad).  Those are the inputs that the iPad pro doesn't have, but the MacBooks do - or did, until the newest gen of MacBook Pro and the MacBook 12 inch.  Those took a step back.  If Microsoft can go for the win on the keyboard and trackpad, they will win a lot more converts.  Cortana already runs circles around Siri (and although Google Assistant beats Cortana, Google is not in this laptop/laptop replacement contest). Why do I focus on laptop replacement, rather than "smartphones?"  Because the future is computing devices, not phones.  And computing devices need software, which is why iOS and Android are winning.  If Microsoft can build the best computing devices (they are THIS close to doing so), the developers will follow.  In other words, the best software requires people to build it, and those people prefer to work on the best hardware.  Apple has squandered its multiyear lead on hardware superiority, Google isn't in that game, so it is Microsoft's for the taking. 2 5 days ago Reply kansokusha Microsoft will do all the innovation, and they'll screw themselves and their customers with horrible implementation and abysmal product support.

It is a fact that Apple (and later Google with Android) broadened the scope, experience and market for personal computing. For some reason, I keep feeling like Microsoft's adherence to a Enterprise-first consumer base keeps limiting them from developing truly consumer-wowing (and consistent) user experiences: E.g. 1: Teams is an awesome product but they lock it within the enterprise (i.e. O365) ensuring that few outside of the 85 million (?) O365 users would ever go for it (so Slack slurps the "outcasts" up), making Teams seems more like a defensive move against Slack encroaching on existing (and future?) O365 users rather than a superior take. If it were a free/low-cost non-O365 (at first) tool, Teams could probably be used to draw people into the main ecosystem (see all the cool things you can get it to do with O365). E.g. 2: Windows 8/10 and the UI/UX confusions and inconsistencies (till date). Windows 10 (with a UI refresh) is good for desktop, but tablet and mobile are lighter and should have lighter UI. Touch-enabled Win 10 is not necessarily good enough as a tablet-only UI (especially in the 7-9" range). Legacy (business) makes them shoehorn different UI paradigms together, limiting the power of the Live Tile to evolve and show its superiority to other UI/UX paradigms). It's not whoever has the best designed product or innovation, it's whoever sells and blasts the goodness and uniqueness of their product early enough (and says they did it first and best) that gets noticed. Microsoft must point out the new innovations they bring to the market first. Not just to tech press but the general public. Look at the new HP ads with Christian Slater! Look at the responses. Relevant and good publicity (and that's just for printers). Microsoft will always attract only the work-related perception from consumers and the tech press as long as it always sells itself only on "productivity" (=business). That is why I like the focus on "Creativity" (a la Creative Update, etc.). I think it should be more than a one-off update name but rather a modern ethos (a sort of Productivity 2.0?) for Microsoft. The Creative Lifestyle. Maybe two marketing identities for business (productive) and consumers (creative)? 0 5 days ago Reply Asc aris Windows 8/10 and the UI/UX confusions and inconsistencies (till date). Windows 10 (with a UI refresh) is good for desktop, but tablet and mobile are lighter and should have lighter UI. Touch-enabled Win 10 is not necessarily good enough as a tablet-only UI (especially in the 7-9" range). So Windows 10 needs a UI refresh to be good for desktop, and is not well suited to mobile either in its current form.  If that is what you're saying, I agree completely.  What it looks like is that MS has designed "one UI to rule them all" that is equally mediocre on both of the platforms it's supposed to cover.  It seems that a lot of the excitement over this isn't about the product as delivered, but is instead about the promise of what it might deliver in the future once the rough spots are smoothed out.  Unfortunately, though, I think that the rough spots are not merely a function of as-yet incomplete development so much as a structural issue that has to do with the very nature of generalization vs. specialization.  The better MS makes Windows 10 for tablets (and phones even more so), the worse it ends up being for the desktop.  They can move that slider to an infinite number of positions along the "continuum"  between mobile and desktop platforms, but favoring one will always mean hampering the other, and that's not just an issue of polish or fine-tuning.   Ultimately, it all boils down to yet another proof of the "Jack of all trades, master of none" trope.  Mobile devices and traditional PCs have differing needs, and when you try to write one UI that covers both, it's just not going to work as well on either of them as a dedicated UI for that platform-- and since we do have examples of that on desktops (Windows 7, MacOS) and mobiles (Android, iOS), the bar is going to be set as high as the perceived quality and fitness of each dedicated UI.  Windows 10 falls far short of what desktop users have had for many years in terms of a polished, consistent, and visually coherent UI.  It still feels confused about whether it wants to be a phone or a PC. If MS insists on going down this road, the only way I can really see it working is to have two complete UIs within Windows, and to select the one that is most appropriate according to circumstance and user preferences.  Desktop PCs and traditional laptops would have the desktop UI, same as Windows always has, while mobiles would get the UWP UI.  Each UI would be feature-complete by itself and optimized for its platform, so there would never be any need to muddle through on a bit of the OS that was designed for a platform other than the one then in use.  Convertible/2 in 1 devices could default to the desktop UI when in laptop mode, and to the UWP UI when the keyboard/base is removed.  The user, ideally, would be able to change these settings to suit his needs better, since one size rarely (if ever) fits all. When you look at it in those terms, it doesn't seem all that innovative anymore (to me at least).  Including two complete UIs for two separate platforms, running on two different sets of binaries (x86 and ARM, of course) that happen to have been compiled from similar/the same source code sounds a lot like writing two distinct (though closely related) operating systems for two distinct platforms, then slapping the same name on each and caling it one product.  It may not be as "gee whiz" cool in its implementation, but it would allow a no-compromise UI for each platform, and I don't think users will (or should have to) accept anything less than that.   0 2 days ago Reply Bai So we go a full cycle and back to RT?  C-shell seriously don't matter to most.  Cellar PC, a fancy name of smartphone.  When was the last time you use a use a x86 program for personal use?  Me photo editing is the only x86 I still use, and that I don't want/care about ARM and battery life because no battery will last a few hundred RAW convertion.  I either have it plug in all the way or do it on my PC.  For office use, why do I want a ARM laptop 2-1 or whatever when I can have my x86 CRM on a regular laptop?  Or I can remote it from any Android/IOS/WP/PC.  Wake me up when adobe/sales force/auto cad...etc make a ARM UWP.  For productivity cloud is the future and cloud don't care what the front end is, it could be ios/android/wp it don't matter.  There are companies that send cad project to hosting company to render and cut the time in 1/2.  There are online RAW converter alreadyInot a very good one).  Continuum make a alot of sense, and I don't need a full feature win10 fo it. 0 5 days ago Reply LIEBER I'm interested in the possibility of running Windows 10 Pro on ARM processors. Will it be possible to run *all* Win32 bit applications on ARM 835 processor, in emulation mode? How does this relate to HP Elite X3 and the possibility to run ordinary applications on a HP server? An alternative approach... is to use an "old fashioned" solution. 30 years ago, it was possible to run X Windows terminals and remotely log in via a network. A modern solution could be: * MS includes a Windows terminal program (similar to Teamviewer, etc.) as part of Windows 10 * It should be possible to remotely log into another Windows machine via internet or via 4G/5G phone networks; it must be possible to reach through routers, firewalls, etc. * Assuming I have a desktop computer, job work station, home media computer, etc., and that I have all the 32 bit or 64 bit applications I need on these, it should be possible to log in from ARM based (and intel based) smartphones, tablets, laptops, or in principle any type of computer ("terminal machine"), and run the programs on my desktop, workstation, media computer, etc. ("server machine") -- remotely * The "terminal window" should mirror the desktop on the "server" computer. * If I have two screens on my "terminal" PC, it should be possible to run the terminal window on one screen, and run other programs on any screen. * It should be possible to cut and paste between the "terminal" PC and the terminal window of the "server". * If both "terminal" PC and the "server" PC sync files via OneDrive (or DropBox, or whatever), this gives transparent exchange of files. But copy and pasting may still be useful. OK... personally, I'm a little skeptical about completely depending on running programs on a remote computer -- what if internet is down (or the connection is slow), or what if there are expensive roaming fees on 4G/5G? So I certainly see the usefulness of running 32 bit (and if possible, 64 bit) applications on the smartphone/tablet/etc. (ARM processor, etc.), but a modern "terminal" program will make it possible to, in practice, run 32 bit and 64 bit programs on relatively light weight ARM processor based units. The main problem with this approach is with small screen devices such as smartphones: I'm not sure the user experience will be good with running *applications* on a small screen -- maybe a foldable screen device may make it possible to fold out a decent screen? UWP apps is something else -- they are designed to adapt to various screen sizes. 0 5 days ago Reply L0n3N1nja IPad apps as they currently are on a laptop? I don't see that ever going anywhere.

In the public mindspace, Windows is still a desktop OS - when they want a mobile it's Android or iOS. Part of this is Microsoft's failed "Continuum" strategy in their UI - it's still the exact same UI not matter what device you're on. This is a problem because ​people don't want a desktop/start menu on their mobile device​. This is something Microsoft hasn't learned since the days of Windows CE. Windows 8 was a good start, but failed because the "Desktop Mode" should have been more Windows 10 and Windows 10 fails the tablet/moble users because it needs to be more Windows 8. The idea is a great one, they NEED to figure out that "Desktop UI" is NOT the same as "Tablet UI" is not the same as "Phone UI" (though Tablet UI and Phone UI should be much closer to each other than Desktop UI). In the end, Apple's strategy is correct for the here and now, but Microsoft's strategy will ultimatly be correct (if it grows up signifigantly in the next couple years). 1 5 days ago Reply Tunde Fajimi I give it one year of rapid maturing.

Love or hate Apple, you need to thank them what they did in the market. They opened it up to more of a smart device from what were using. If you wanted a SMART device, you  had a Windows Mobile/PocketPC (a pocket Windows version with the bugs) or Blackberry. Apple came with a store, and the format Microsoft has always dreamed of.  Maybe Microsoft would of came up with it but, they were 5 years too late and by then, they lost.

That is why time and time again, Apple or Google (through Samsung in the majority of cases) will always be heralded as the companies that "invented" features Microsoft already had before. When was the last time you saw a Microsoft ad showcasing Windows 10? I'm not talking about PC/Surface ads, but what Microsoft is doing with and for Windows 10. A 30 second ad of Windows on different form factors (including phone) would start to make people look and think more closely to Microsoft and maybe call out certain tech sites when they start babbling about how great feature x or y is on iOS or Android. The rare Microsoft ads I see in the UK on television are for the Cloud. I know professionals also watch TV but it doesn't showcase anything "useful" for the regular Joe. And it's not like Microsoft doesn't have some good hardware/form factors to show off: Xbox One, HoloLens, Elite X3, Surface Pro/Book. If people knew all of the above run Windows 10 (and not necessarily version x86/64, Mobile, etc) then maybe people (consumers and developers) can see one of the advantages of UWP and build/port more apps and services over. All of this of course won't mean anything if Microsoft doesn't push harder to improve the OS as a whole, instead of spending resources in helping out other platforms with apps containing more features. 6 5 days ago Reply Tunde Fajimi You said it all! 1 5 days ago Reply sdreamer Totally agree MS is pushing the tech arena lately, but is getting almost 0 credit. We can see how Apple and Google reacted to the Surface Pro line with their own Pro lines. You can also see some new AR headsets that seem to suddenly pop after the hololens was released. MS is really pushing hard for new things, but the market just doesn't see them anymore sadly. Then their lack of consistent support, and quality of support in some cases  really does not help. Apple really has a solid foundation right now, and many draw comparison to MS back then, but the key difference is users like Apple vs back then it was the cool thing to poke at MS. Apple too is too big to fail, but even if they start to, they are so well liked that it's almost impossible to really topple; maybe stumble, but not fall face first. I just wish MS was consistent, delivered the hardward they envisioned. I'd still be on a WP if they probably had the hardware, but they don't right now, and the company that offers the most consistent experience for productivity for me right now is Apple, and I've slowly transitioned to them but still using MS services as a backbone, and that works just great. 2 5 days ago Reply Tunde Fajimi I agree that MS has not always executed well enough the first time out, even when they had the lead.

Even you started from the idea of Android phone than expanding to chromebook or Android tablet. What the world will learn is that this progression isn't a necessity to mobile computing. Microsoft knows they lost the smartphone battle so I believe that's the point. They know computing needs to be mobile so instead of a smartphone mobile take, they are taking a 'p.c.' mobile take. The industry killed their smartphone business already so they don't have any future smartphone business of their own to kill; only the competition's. To conclude, I believe you're correct and THAT'S the point of the endeavors being made now. You may want to wait a bit to see if a surface pro 5 is on the horizon depending on your budget. Not to say the sp4 is a bad choice. I use the sp3 and im still beyond happy with this purchase decision. 1 4 days ago Reply Lampros Light I believe everything will be brought to light after build 2017.

Personally, Live Tiles weren't the highlight of WP for me at all. It was the whole of the design language that worked perfectly together, and Live Times were a small part of it.

There's no denying the impact Apple has had in shifting personal computing from a sedentary setting to a mobile landscape. That shift has mad mobile ecosystems and apps very important. The need for a the desktop productivity environment has not been eliminated, however. The move of the mobile landscape to the desktop environment is what we are seeing happenng. It is also what Mossberg has argued will be a massive shift as ARM processors come on laptop form factors and IF iOS also comes to that form factor. He argues that Apple will have the greatest impact in refining the PC. I argue that Microsoft, with Windows 10, the UWP and Continuum has already done, and is driving that evolution. PC makers and consumers have embraced Microsoft's PC vision. Apple is following. It is true however that most PC users are not using the Store apps, which if they are full UWP apps, are by nature also mobile apps. This is where Apple, with iOS on laptop may conciously win users to a laptop with a mobile app focus. So what do you think.

Microsoft's attempts are most of the time half-hearted and incomplete. Take WP for example. How long did we scream about updates for simple things the competition had for years? It wasn't too hard to create a decent music player on WP8.1. Now look at the Windows 10 built-in Store apps. Almost all of them seem incomplete, lacking clear design guidelines and crashing as if interns are responsible for creating the most important part of Microsoft's future. For all their "expertise" in creating software, Microsoft lacks skill in creating almost any form of software related to mobile - Windows 10 Mobile being the prime example. (I don't believe it deseves to be WP 8.1's successor in any way). The Tablet Mode on Windows 10 SUCKS. Watching a video in Tablet Mode, double click on the video and watch is the window visibly resizes to smaller size and then goes back o full screen, indicaing sloppy coding. Closeing some Win32 windows in tablet mode results in a blank screen where you can't do anything, instead of going back to the Start screen. The whole thing is incomplete, and second grade software like this will NOT challenge Apple in the long run. When Microsoft themselves decided the Windws Explorer in full screen is good enough to take care of file management even in Tablet Mode, why would anyone decide to create UWP apps for tablets and limit themselves framework-wise when they can create Win32 and target all Windows versions? This whole strategy is all patch work and will not hold up against a proper attack from either Apple or Google targeting the desktop. 6 5 days ago Reply Liam Ke Yes. 0 3 days ago Reply wpbazaar Nup.

Besides if you plan to make an app that you can't finish in a few month, you can't reserve the name in advance, since it is only protected one year.

And when it is published and don't be a hit (maybe because it not really finished), then the developer looses intrest in it. Not all can afford to quit they job to work fulltime on an app. For most of us it a parttime thing. One thing I really miss when working with XAML is the ability to use % just as we do in HTML.

I did look at alternatives for things like mocking for unit tests, but they were either rather expensive commercial products, or, in the case of the mocking frameworks, the free components that were able to get around the "reflection emit" issue were, for me, simply inadequate. While some breaking changes are to be expected in making a change like migrating from "classic" .Net to UWP, if Microsoft really want all Windows developers to embrace the "new way of doing things" then expecting them to throw away significant portions of their existing core code because it was designed to work with components that don't (or can't) support UWP is going to deincentivise the case for bothering with a UWP version.  Though many of these components aren't under the direct control of Microsoft, and who knows why many of them haven't been upgraded to .Net Standard, for example, it wouldn't hurt for Microsoft to "encourage" them to be upgraded to help boost the case for UWP app development.  Besides, at a personal level, I don't really care if Microsoft or someone else made a particular component I use in my applications: if I can't get it to work in a UWP application then I'm more likely to conclude that UWP is way too much hassle and I'd be better off sticking to "classic" .Net (and yes, I am aware of the Centennial app bridge). 1 5 days ago Reply AgentTheGreat But honestly, what is the point of developing UWP instead of, say, WPF with "classic" .NET? We hear a lot of "it runs on phones, XBOX, HoloLens" etc. but Windows phones are nowhere to be found, XBOX is a gaming console and HoloLens is simply vaporware. You'd trade a rich set of tried and true APIs and Frameworks for...what exactly? BTW HoloLens reminds me of the original "Surface table" that excited lots of people (myself included) just to go into oblivion. Microsoft has a "vision" always in words. If you've seen any push in the direction of this vision, show me. All I've seen so far is trading of truely powerful sofware for their weak counterparts - like Windows Media Player with the "mobile" Groove Music and WP8 with W10M. By the time HoloLens gets up and running (if it ever does) the competition is very likely to get there with something of their own, and they are in the right place too: imagine an Android augmented reality headset that runs apps just like HoloLens does;  Augmented reality isn't really for content creation but mostly entertainment and collaboration and these categories are a good fit for mobile apps instead of something like Photoshop. So Google and Apple can pretty easiy release HoloLens-esque headsets and jump in the game. I'm sorry. But it seems to me that with all this fumbling of ideas Microsoft puts them on the path to oblivion in the consumer space. 3 4 days ago Reply Random DS If I buy a mini PC, hook it up to my TV, connect an IR airmouse, and enable tablet mode (because having multiple windows on your TV is pointless 99% of the time), does it still count as a desktop?

Soon in the Microsoft Store you will be able to change your cell provider and manage you account. Cortana will take care of almost everything you need. Soon we may not need a phone at all. You will wear a thing on your wrist and a plug in your ear and a pair or glasses to let you see. I'm old enough to think that a smart phone is straight up Star Trek ****. We really don't know what will come out and change our lives next year. It seems Apple doesn't anymore either but Microsoft is trying at least. 1 5 days ago Reply paulxxwall Doesn't hurt to dream now does it... 1 5 days ago Reply Francisco_dAn I love the idea of a phone becoming a powerful extension of a PC but when I'm working on a PC, I want the big fat luxury of a PC. I want my fat version of Office Pro to crunch data for planning and analysis while being able to automatically sync the information with my phone and present it to a wide audience. That's what Microsoft is best at, productivity for the masses.

Even just scaling from a phone's 4.5" screen to a 10" tablet looked awful. They dumped that line a month after launch. Without the secret-foo powers of Continuum, a phone app on a laptop or a 20+ inch desktop will look ridiculous and be a waste. It takes more than a common kernel to make an app scale. The UX has to adapt to the new medium as well. Microsoft has a huge head start over Apple and Alphabet on this capability. 13 5 days ago Reply noirsoft Devs have the option with UWP apps to have entirely different UI designs for different screen sizes and form factors, with the code behind being the same. yes, simple scaling is the default, but not the only option. 0 5 days ago Reply Prometheus2021 Amazing article!!! It was a great read from start to finish. I'm confident in MS's ability to lead amd bring the evolution of the PC.

Posted from an Android S7 because I dropped my 950XL and could not replace it... 1 4 days ago Reply Tommy Sebestyen My only problem with the UWP apps is that most of the ones that are meaningful to most general users (i.e. Facebook, Messenger, Twitter, Instagram) are either clunky and not coded well, not maintained, missing from the Store entirely, or lacking basic functionality that the iOS, Android, or web apps have.  This is the biggest reason why people don't use UWP apps.  If the apps on the Store that mattered were made well, then maybe more people would use them.  The potential is massive, but devs don't use it. 0 4 days ago Reply Tommy Sebestyen For example, I usually keep the Facebook Messenger website open.  For about a week I tried to use the Messenger UWP app.  It disconnected my Bluetooth, took 5 minutes to load after being minimized, and lacked a button for entering normal emojis, forcing me to open the Windows touch keyboard to enter emojis.  It also doesn't have a reply box in the notification, which is obviously possible *cough* Skype Preview *cough* and (I think) is there in Android 7.0.  It isn't optimized for a large display at all, either.  Comparing the website with the app, I found I'd rather have to refresh the website if I lose my Internet connection than wait 5 minutes for an app to load my messages. 0 4 days ago Reply 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2016 Mobile Nations • Terms and Conditions • Privacy Policy • Careers: Writer | Dev • Licensing • External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner

The policy yet to be reflected on Apple.com – but which the folks at MacRumors have been able to confirm with a senior AppleCare advisor, will see those who purchase an iPhone from the company given up to a year from the date of their purchase to add AppleCare+ protection. That’s up significanly from the usual 60 days. “Notably, the change is retro-active so if you purchased an iPhone within the last year, you are now eligible to get AppleCare+,” iClarified adds. The new policy will reportedly also be applied to Mac and Apple TV purchases – too. AppleCare+ for iPhone costs $129 in the U.S and provides up to two years of expert telephone technical support and hardware coverage, including up to two incidents of accidental damage, each subject to an excess fee of $29 for screen damage, or $99 for any other damage.

Andrew Tonner (TMFTheDude) Mar 17, 2017 at 8:43PM At least at some level, investing can be a lot like a spy novel. A narrative might appear one way at first only to change as new details emerge; things are rarely exactly as they first seem. This idea certainly holds true in comparing tech companies Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Corning (NYSE:GLW). Trading at roughly half of Apple's valuation, the superficial numbers would suggest that Corning is clearly the better buy. However, for the three reasons you will see below, the numbers alone fail to tell the entire story. Here's why Apple is a better value stock to buy today than Corning. 1. Corning isn't as cheap as it looks The sheer cheapness of its stock jumps out immediately when looking at Corning. At a time when the S&P 500 trades at roughly 26 times earnings -- admittedly well above its own historic norms -- Corning stock currently trades hands at a minuscule 8.5 times earnings. However, this also contains an important investing lesson: Stocks tend to trade at such seemingly preposterous discounts for a reason. Case in point: Corning booked a $2.6 billion gain on the revaluation of one of its equity investments during its fiscal 2016, which inflated its pre-tax income by roughly 190% on the year. With its earnings per share (EPS) expect to grow at 8% this year, Corning's 15.3 forward P/E ratio serves as a far better indicator of the company's actual valuation than its current P/E. Again, the alarm bells should go off any time you see the shares of a healthy company like Corning trading at so seemingly cheap a valuation. Corning isn't nearly as cheap as it appears at first glance. Image source: Apple. 2. Apple is cheaper than it looks Just as Corning isn't as cheap as it looks, the value of Apple's core operating business is actually far lower than its P/E suggests. The underlying reason is fairly well documented at this point; Apple's net cash surplus totaled $158.6 billion in its most recent quarterly filing. Subtracting this staggering figure from Apple's market capitalization reduces its valuation to $570.6 billion.  Using this net-cash-adjusted market cap as the numerator to Apple's P/E ratio provides an updated valuation for the Mac maker of just 12.6 times earnings, which is significantly lower than Corning's valuation metric after removing the effect of the one-time accounting gains it recorded this year. Seen this way, Apple actually offers investors better value, though this line of reasoning does little to factor in either company's growth outlook. However, the investment thesis turns even more in Apple's favor upon adding in the companies' long-term return profiles. 3. Apple's growth outlook beats Corning's Not to belabor the point, but comparing Apple's forward growth rates against those of Corning supports the same conclusion. Looking to the top line, consensus Wall Street estimates call for Apple to increase its sales by 5.9% this year and 7.5% next year. Meanwhile, Corning is expected to see its sales rise 3.4% in 2016 and 1.2% in 2017. The same relationship -- Apple slightly outgrowing Corning -- also applies to sell-side estimates for the two companies' earnings per share. Much of this is likely attributable to Apple's expected debut of a fully redesigned 10th anniversary iPhone this fall. Corning, of course, will benefit from Apple's latest iPhone as a component supplier for the handset. However, Apple will certainly benefit far more from the highly anticipated device. Beyond sales and earnings growth, Apple's gigantic -- and growing -- cash surplus gives the company far more flexibility to enhance overall shareholder returns through increased dividends and buybacks. The company can also invest heavily in future growth initiatives like electric cars or digital streaming content without affecting its current earnings outlook. At the end of the day, although Corning is no slouch in its own right, Apple is clearly the better value stock between the two companies. Andrew Tonner owns shares of Apple.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Software tvOS 10.2 Beta 6 & watchOS 3.2 Beta 6 Now Available By Uzair Ghani Mar 14, 2017 10Shares Share Tweet Submit Hot on the heels of yesterday’s release, Apple has seeded tvOS 10.2 Beta 6 and watchOS 3.2 Beta 6 to developers for download. Apple Watch and Apple TV Developers Can Now Download the Latest Pre-Release Software For their Devices Apple released iOS 10.3 Beta 6 and macOS 10.12.4 Beta 6 just yesterday, and today Apple is pushing its efforts forward with the release of tvOS 10.2 Beta 6 and watchOS 3.2 Beta 6. All of the aforementioned software is available to download over the air. And since we have covered iOS 10.3 and macOS 10.12.4 beta builds yesterday, therefore we will focus on just tvOS 10.2 and watchOS 3.2 today. Related Apple Releases watchOS 3.2 Beta 7 & macOS 10.12.4 Beta 8 Assuming you have a previous beta of watchOS 3.2 already installed on your Apple Watch, launch the Watch app on your iPhone. Now place your Apple Watch on its magnetic charger. Navigate to General > Software Updates inside the Watch app and then tap on Download and Install once the latest update pops up. The entire process may take quite a while given the installation process happens over Bluetooth. Therefore please do not remove your wearable from its charger at any point during the installation. Advertisement Apple TV users can update to tvOS 10.2 Beta 6 in a breeze too. Just turn on your device, navigate to Settings > System > Software Updates and install the available update there. Just like the Apple Watch, make sure you do not do anything funny with your Apple TV during the entire process. Once everything is done and dusted, you may use your set top box as you normally would. Given the fact that we are sitting on the sixth beta release of Apple’s software across the board, it’s highly likely the final release is just a few days away. It’s best to prepare all your devices beforehand and make room for the update so that things move smoothly for you when the big download day arrives. tvOS 10.2 Beta 6 and watchOS 3.2 Beta 6 brings with them nothing more than bug fixes and performance related patches therefore do not expect something huge.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile Concept Imagines How AR & Siri Would Work Together on iPhone 8 By Uzair Ghani Mar 14, 2017 10Shares Share Tweet Submit Wondering how Apple might utilize augmented reality on the iPhone 8? A new concept render gives us a good glimpse into the future. New iPhone 8 Concept Imagines Device With Siri & AR Features Given Apple’s recent acquisitions, and statements made by Tim Cook, there’s no doubt left in the fact that the company is pretty serious about AR. Recent reports also suggest that the iPhone 8 would be the first device to implement AR related features, but it’s unclear how the entire package will pan out. One designer, however, took things into his own hand and conjured up a concept showing augmented reality and Siri working together to form a match that can only be described as a far-fetched dream right now. Related The iPhone 8 Will feature Curved OLEDs Manufactured By Samsung, Claims Nikkei Created by Gabor Balogh, the designer imagines a wonderful AR experience that begins straight from the home screen itself. Once Siri is all fired up, the background turns into a live view of the world ahead of you, with the assistant all set to interact with the device as well as the objects around it. You can then ask Siri questions like ‘What’s that building?’ or even get walking direction, with the path being outlined in real-time on the display. Advertisement The real world is not hidden by the device anymore. If raised, the environment is visible in the background of the home screen in a semi-transparent way, indicating that you can unveil it by pressing the digital Home button. Same way as now, but Siri would be present in augmented reality… Siri would now not only listen you, but would see the world. It would recognize objects, know where you are, what your activity is and what you probably need in that moment. The designer even went ahead in implementing a digital Home button much like how other concept designers have in their mockups. It’s a neat little touch and gives the smartphone a unique personality, putting focus on a ginormous display rather than the bezels that are doing nothing except eating up space. Related Suppliers Ship Samples For Thermaformed Glass On iPhone 8 That Will Facilitate Wireless Charging Augmented reality is going to be interesting in a lot of ways, but it remains to be seen how things will pan out once it is launched, if at all. If Apple is so confident in the technology, then it seems likely that the company has figured out something which no one else has thus far. We will wait and see what it is.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Security Apple Hires Jonathan Zdziarski – Popular iOS Security Researcher and Forensics Expert By Rafia Shaikh Mar 14, 2017 11Shares Share Tweet Submit Apple has hired Jonathan Zdziarski, a popular forensics expert and security researcher who has been long involved in the iOS security and jailbreaking community. Apple hires Jonathan Zdziarski The tech industry isn’t intrigued – and worried – about anything as much as it is about cybersecurity at the moment. With massive breaches taking down the biggest tech companies of the world and DDoS attacks, making it impossible for an entire country to connect to the internet, it is not a surprise that tech leaders are also trying to improve their bug bounty programs and hire the best talent. Related Apple’s Online Store Will Be Unavailable Tomorrow Due To ‘Maintenance’ While the latest WikiLeaks release may have only dumped vulnerabilities that were already taken care of, it made it clear that it’s the device makers who will now have to take charge of security. With iOS and Android devices being vulnerable to attacks, services such as Signal or Telegram have no chance of offering true end-to-end encrypted communications to users. Advertisement In the latest news, iPhone forensics consult and security researcher Jonathan Zdziarski announced that he has accepted a position with Apple Security Engineering and Architecture team. Zdziarski was one of the most vocal iOS security researchers during the Apple-FBI battle over encryption last year. Zdziarski posted about his new role at Apple earlier today. He hasn’t yet revealed details about his responsibilities at the company or his official starting date. I’m pleased to announce that I’ve accepted a position with Apple’s Security Engineering and Architecture team, and am very excited to be working with a group of like minded individuals so passionate about protecting the security and privacy of others. Related Apple Pledges Two More R&D Centers Investing Over Half a Billion Dollars in China This decision marks the conclusion of what I feel has been a matter of conscience for me over time. Privacy is sacred; our digital lives can reveal so much about us – our interests, our deepest thoughts, and even who we love. I am thrilled to be working with such an exceptional group of people who share a passion to protect that. Those who have been following iOS security news would recognize Zdziarski from a number of stories, including Apple’s high-profile “argument” with the FBI over unlocking an iPhone.

It’s obvious that we are. “The Government has been forced into belated action by the media and the opposition, and even then are refusing to consult on the option of a diverted profit tax, which has been employed to deal with this issue in Australia and the UK. “New Zealanders expect their Government to take a stand when it’s revealed that a multinational company has been avoiding hundreds of millions of dollars in tax, “It is astonishing that Judith Collins refused to front up to the Herald about this sort of behaviour. She was willing to be tough with 17 year olds in souped-up Mazda’s, but not with major multi-nationals that are ripping off Kiwi taxpayers. “Labour stands for a fair tax system in which everyone pays their fair share. We will implement a better multi-national tax policy and insisting on a tough, credible package that puts an end to rorts like these,” says Michael Wood.

Receive comments via RSS Add a comment joestoner  2017-03-14 07:47 The way that the Genius Bar works (at least here in the UK) IS idiotic! Only ONE appointment for ONE issue!! I live nearly a hundred miles from Manchester ( the most accessible GB) which makes it VERY impracticable to use!!! Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc  2017-03-17 10:36 While inconvenient for you, the limitation is doubtless a response to supply and demand—the demand for Genius Bar appointments exceeds the supply of Genius Bar employees (I won't bother to call them geniuses since a real genius is unlikely to be working in an Apple Store—bearing in mind that genius in this context is nevertheless a relative term). If you're that far from an Apple Store, perhaps you should learn to do your own tech support, or find someone locally who can do the work for you, if "time is money" is a value proposition for you. Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc  2017-03-17 11:31 Perhaps the reason Steve thought that people who know technology don't know how to connect with people was because he didn't know how to connect with people. Apparently he didn't notice that Steve Wozniak was much better with that sort of thing than he was. Jobs was known, after all, for his tunnel vision. In fact, many early Apple (and Adobe) evangelists were people oriented. As were the folks who participated in Apple (and Adobe) user groups. Still, Jobs was at least half right. It has always been a problem for programmers and other technical specialists, like engineers, to interface with clients and customers. You know, like your average IT manager. But people skills and technical expertise are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Theoretically it's a personnel manager's job to match people with the right combination of skills to the jobs they have to fill. When they fail to do so it's a reflection on their own (in)competence. I think it's safe to say that most small business owners have to have a balance of people skills and technical expertise of one kind and another if they expect to be successful. Or they have to have a partner or partners who balance the skills they lack. Which puts a premium on teamwork. Of course Steve Jobs was not a team player or a team builder. He habitually made unreasonable demands on his employees, requiring that they sacrifice their personal lives (and health) for their business lives—another reflection on his lack of people skills and human insight. By the time he changed his mind and trademarked Genius Bar perhaps he was beginning to understand his own limitations and to make allowances for them. Correct me if I'm wrong, but he apparently showed a lighter hand at Pixar than he did at Apple, cultivating the kind of collegial atmosphere that nurtures creativity. Despite the obvious hype in the name Genius Bar, it is the genius of Apple stores that you can get the kind of technical help that once was lacking in other retail tech outlets. The Genius Bar has served as a model for other businesses, like Best Buy, that now provide in person technical support to their customers. Comcast is notable in this regard as well, offering both in store and on sight assistance. Even AT&T is making an effort these days. That's the sort of influence that's hard to measure, but anyone studying business trends must take it into account. So, it would be hard to find a more significant change of heart on Steve's part, for which he truly deserves his props. Reply  Search   Cached.

Ng: Smart watches and terms & conditions | SunStar Skip to main content SunStar CEBU Tue, March 21, 2017 SunStar CEBU Home News Business Opinion Sports Feature Lifestyle Entertainment Superbalita Cagayan de Oro Cebu Davao SunStar Cebu Bacolod Baguio Cagayan de Oro Davao Dumaguete Iloilo Manila Pampanga Tacloban Zamboanga Tue, March 21, 2017 Home Local News Business Opinion Sports Feature Lifestyle Entertainment SuperBalita Home / Cebu / Business / Ng: Smart watches and terms & conditions Ng: Smart watches and terms & conditions Time to read 1 minute Share Print a- a+ Read so far Ng: Smart watches and terms & conditions Friday, March 17, 2017 By Wilson Ng Wired Desktop IN 2015, I noted the growing interest in smart watches. Why would you want a traditional watch that can only tell time? Why not one that can do a dozen other things like check your text messages, know your heart rate, know how many steps you walked a day, know the temperature forecast and the actual temperature? What’s more, it was not only for heatlh. With the entry of Apple Watch, it was also for fashion. Move forward to 2017, and it seems like things are not too exciting. Apple still sold over four million of its smart watches, but I believe that was half what everybody was expecting. Total shipments for this was said to be about 100 million for the whole year, which represents a growth of about 25 percent. For a category that is less than four years old, this kind of growth seems like it is sputtering. Amazingly, the leading brands were FitBit and Xiaomi. Apple was only third, while Samsung was only fifth in shipments. Part of the problem is that these smart watches need to be charged every night. And sometimes when you forget, or when you travel, it is just too much of a hassle, and when you do need to the watch to tell the time, it cannot function because the battery is drained. ***** Who among you reads the terms and conditions when you purchase something from the Internet? I bet none. How do I know you haven’t read it? Because it’s almost impossible for some to do so. An article was written that if you buy Amazon’s Kindle, the terms and conditions that you have to accept consists of over 73,000 words in its present state. To print it out would take 146 pages. To read it out loud, it would take about nine hours. Now what would convince you to read it? Just click accept. But even if you are not legalistic, then you should know that there are certain things that are clearly dangerous to do. A mom used Facebook Live to broadcast her 10-year-old driving her Jeep Cherokee on the road. Guess what? His friends alerted the police, and she was apprehended and charged with risk of injury and impairing the morals of a minor. So just take note. If you are broadcasting or recording doing something that is illegal, beware! Published in the Sun.Star Cebu newspaper on March 18, 2017.

Although the change has yet to be reflected on the company's website, MacRumors confirmed the new policy with a senior AppleCare advisor. The one year purchase window now applies to Mac, Apple TV, and iPhone but does not yet apply to the iPad, iPod touch, and Apple Watch. Notably, the change is retro-active so if you purchased an iPhone within the last year, you are now eligible to get AppleCare+. AppleCare+ for iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 6s, and iPhone 6s Plus costs $129. You'll need to have your device inspected in store or run a remote diagnostic to purchase AppleCare+ after the fact. [via MacRumors] Follow iClarified Comments (4) Add Comment Pamela5 - March 18, 2017 at 8:41am Finally. Now after the free 1 year basic warranty is over you can purchase apple care instead of paying for a year you would be covered for free anyway. This is good for people that just need protection from manufacturer hardware failure and defects and don't worry about dropping their phone or other consumer fault issues. Reply · Like · Mark as Spam chicken_leg - March 19, 2017 at 1:19am The warranty was always like that already. The difference now is that you can actually get warranty later in the process for example at the 300 day mark of your first year. I feel like if you tried to get a warranty at a really late stage Apple would require a diagnostic test on your phone. This requires you visiting the Apple store, checking out all their cool things, and maybe end up buying something more anyways. This is flexing the power of their diagnostic tools to see if they can go ahead and take your warranty money after their diagnostic tools say your phone is OK, and hope on their end your phone does not have any issues. This is also another point in their arsenal as well to the whole "open repair" thing that has been going around where people are asking Apple to provide authorized shops to genuine parts. If they tell the government that they offer 2 years of warranty it would definitely hurt the need for "open repair."

And $129 for a longer warranty? Seems excessive.

LIVE SMARTER Smart Shopping BIG QUESTIONS Lists VIDEOS QUIZZES STORE PLUS Amazing Facts Job Secrets Language Space Weather World War I Kennections LIVE SMARTER SMART SHOPPING BIG QUESTIONS LISTS VIDEOS QUIZZES PLUS Amazing Facts Job Secrets Language Space Weather World War I Kennections STORE The Hidden Meanings Behind 15 Company Names Share Rudie Obias filed under: image credit: Getty Images Like us on Facebook We spend most of our day surrounded by popular companies and major brands, but have you ever wondered what their names actually mean? Here are the hidden meanings behind 15 of them. 1. TWITTER In 2006, co-founder Jack Dorsey created Twitter as an online SMS service that would update in real-time on a webpage. Its working name was called “Status,” but Dorsey wanted to create a buzzing feeling when you heard the company’s name, so he later thought of “Twitch” because that’s what a phone would do when it would vibrate. However, Dorsey eventually landed on “Twitter” because he didn’t think “Twitch” was a strong enough name. “We wanted to capture that feeling: the physical sensation that you’re buzzing your friend’s pocket,” Dorsey told the Los Angeles Times. “It’s like buzzing all over the world. So we did a bunch of name-storming, and we came up with the word ‘twitch,’ because the phone kind of vibrates when it moves. But ‘twitch’ is not a good product name because it doesn’t bring up the right imagery. So we looked in the dictionary for words around it, and we came across the word ‘twitter,’ and it was just perfect. The definition was ‘a short burst of inconsequential information,’ and ‘chirps from birds.’ And that’s exactly what the product was.” 2. SKYPE First released in 2003, Skype is derived from "Sky peer-to-peer,” as in a way to connect people together from the “sky” wirelessly. It was then shortened to "Skyper." However, Skyper.com was already a registered domain, so its developers simply dropped the “r” at the end to become Skype. 3. FACEBOOK Mark Zuckerberg created Facebook, Inc. as a way to connect Harvard University students online in 2004. The company’s name comes from the physical “face book” directories of students’ faces and names given throughout university campuses in the United States. Originally, it was called TheFacebook.com, but Zuckerberg dropped the “The” at the beginning of the company’s name a year later. Now TheFacebook.com simply re-directs users to Facebook.com. When asked what he would do differently during an interview with TechCrunch, Zuckerberg answered, “I’d get the right domain name.” 4. LEGO Danish carpenter Ole Kirk Christiansen established the name LEGO in 1934 for his manufacturing company, which originally produced stepladders, ironing boards, stools, and wooden toys. The name comes from the Danish phrase "Leg Godt," which means “Play Well” in English and "I Put Together" or "I Assemble" in Latin. LEGO didn’t create the colorful interlocking plastic bricks that the company is known for until 1949.  5. AMAZON Starting in 1994 and originally named “Cadabra,” as in "abracadabra," founder Jeff Bezos re-named his retail company Amazon a year later after his lawyer mistook it for "cadaver." Bezos landed on Amazon because it’s the name of the largest river in the world and he wanted his company to reflect its size with the launch tagline "Earth's biggest bookstore" in 1995. He also liked the name because it would be first in web listings, which were in alphabetical order at the time. Jeff Bezos also considered the name Relentless.com, which he still owns, but re-directs to Amazon.com instead. In addition, Amazon’s logo also reflected the company by selling everything from A to Z. 6. STARBUCKS Established in 1971, Starbucks founders Jerry Baldwin, Zev Siegl, and Gordon Bowker landed on the company’s name after Bowker’s business partner mentioned words beginning with the letters “ST” were powerful and bold. He then noticed the small mining town of “Starbo” on an old mining map of the Cascade Range. Bowker, who is also a writer, later remembered the name of Captain Ahab's first mate in Moby-Dick was “Starbuck” and believed that was a much stronger name. They also believed Starbuck loved coffee, but he doesn’t actually drink coffee in the book. He drinks it in the film adaptation. “I saw Starbo, I, of course, jumped to Melville's first mate [named Starbuck] in Moby-Dick,” Gordon Bowker told The Seattle Times. “But Moby-Dick didn't have anything to do with Starbucks directly; it was only coincidental that the sound seemed to make sense. A lot of times you'll see references to the coffee-loving first mate of the Pequod. And then somebody said to me, well no, it wasn't that he loved coffee in the book, it was that he loved coffee in the movie." The Starbucks founders also considered the names "Cargo House" and "Pequod," the name of Captain Ahab’s ship. 7. 7-ELEVEN Founded in 1927 and originally called “Tote'm Stores”—because customers toted away their groceries—7-Eleven changed its name to reflect its new business hours in 1946. The convenience store chain was open seven days a week from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m., which was considered extended hours during the '40s. Now most 7-Eleven stores are open 24 hours a day, with the first store to do so in Austin, Texas in 1963. 8. APPLE Although many people believe it was named after The Beatles’s record label, Apple Corps Ltd, because its co-founders Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak were big fans of the British rock band, Apple, Inc. was actually named after an apple farm the pair visited in Oregon. Jobs liked the name Apple because it was “fun, spirited and not intimidating.” “It was a couple of weeks later when we came up with a name for the partnership,” recalled Wozniak. “I remember I was driving Steve Jobs back from the airport along Highway 85. Steve was coming back from a visit to Oregon to a place he called an 'apple orchard.' It was actually some kind of commune. Steve suggested a name – Apple Computer. The first comment out of my mouth was, 'What about Apple Records?' This was (and still is) the Beatles-owned record label. We both tried to come up with technical-sounding names that were better, but we couldn’t think of any good ones. Apple was so much better, better than any other name we could think of.” 9. HÄAGEN-DAZS Although it’s not actually a Danish phrase or word, ice cream man Reuben Mattus called his company Häagen-Dazs as a tribute to Denmark's respect and good treatment of Jewish people during World War II. “The only country which saved the Jews during World War II was Denmark, so I put together a totally fictitious Danish name and had it registered,” said Mattus. “Häagen-Dazs doesn’t mean anything. [But] it would attract attention, especially with the umlaut.” 10. SAMSUNG In 1938, founder Lee Byung-chull named his company Samsung because it means “Three Stars” or “Tristar” in Korean. He wanted his company to last forever like stars in the sky, while the number three represents something big, powerful, and bright in Korean culture. 11. IKEA Seventeen-year-old businessman Ingvar Kamprad founded IKEA in 1943. The furniture company’s name is actually an acronym for Ingvar Kamprad’s name and his childhood farm and hometown in Sweden, Elmtaryd, Agunnaryd. 12. GOOGLE Founded in 1996 and originally called “BackRub,” the internet giant Google received its name when co-founder Larry Page misspelled the number “Googol,” which is a digit followed by 100 zeros. Page and co-founder Sergey Brin decided to keep the name because the domain name was available. “It turns out that most people misspell some things,” said Page, which is why Google corrects spelling mistakes for all searches. 13. PANERA BREAD In 1987, Ken Rosenthal started the St. Louis Bread Company in Kirkwood, Missouri. As it grew and expanded into other states, the name changed to Panera Bread when bakery and café chain Au Bon Pain bought it in 1997. The company’s name is made up of two words, “Pane” (Italian for Bread) and “Era” (or Time). It’s also Latin for “breadbasket.” “We wanted a name that was an empty vessel we could put personality into, and that’s how we ended up with Panera,” said co-founder Ron Shaich. 14. SIX FLAGS The amusement park chain is named after its first location, Six Flags Over Texas in Arlington. The six flags refers to the six different regions that governed the Lone Star State: Spain, France, Mexico, the Republic of Texas, the United States of America, and the Confederate States of America. Today, Six Flags operates 20 theme parks and water parks throughout North America. 15. GAP, INC. In 1969, Donald and Doris F. Fisher opened the first Gap retail store in San Francisco, California. The store mainly sold Levi's jeans and vinyl records that were targeted to teenagers and young adults, so the Fishers named their store after the generation gap between younger and older people.

Instead, Apple responded by saying it paid most of its tax in the United States, where the company was based. Apple claims to be the largest taxpayer in the world, but a report says New Zealand got none of it. Photo: AFP A New Zealand Herald investigation found Apple paid no local tax in the last decade, despite selling $4.2 billion worth of products in New Zealand in that time. The government has refused to comment on the report. In a statement today, Apple did not say whether it had paid tax in New Zealand since 2007. Apple said it was the largest taxpayer in the world and followed the law in every country in which it operated. The company said it aimed to be a force for good and was proud of the contributions it made in New Zealand. Revenue Minister Judith Collins said earlier she could not comment on individual cases, but there was a minority of multinationals that tried to reduce their taxes. She said that was unfair and she was working to strengthen the tax rules. Revenue Minister Judith Collins. Photo: RNZ / Claire Eastham-Farrelly Untasted Apple shows govt 'too slow' on tax - Labour The Labour Party made calls for greater transparency over how multinationals conduct their tax affairs. Labour revenue spokesperson Michael Wood argued there was no reason Apple should avoid public scrutiny. "If we do have these large multinational companies who, on the basis of pretty good evidence, are potentially avoiding their tax, they don't actually have the same rights to absolute privacy about that as an ordinary individual who might be under investigation," he said. He said the government had been too slow to act on closing loopholes. "Every single tax expert who looks at this says 'yep, our current system allows for this', he said. "So Apple hasn't been doing anything illegal, they've exploiting loopholes in the tax laws that we've known about for years." Mr Wood promised greater transparency for the tax affairs of overseas corporations if Labour were to win this year's general election.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Tablets Image Source: Jose Sanchez/AP/REX/Shutterstock Apple to launch brand new iPads in early April at Apple Campus inauguration event Chris Smith @chris_writes March 14th, 2017 at 6:50 AM Share Tweet A report earlier this week said Apple is expected to take the wraps off its 2017 iPads in the coming weeks, a tablet family that’s supposed to bring over a brand new iPad Pro flavor. Usually, Apple announces such new products during special keynotes, but some believed that Apple might launch the new iOS tablets without hosting a media event. A new report out of Asia now claims that a keynote is very much in the works for early April. Apple’s first major keynote of the year will also double as the first event to be held at Apple’s new headquarters. Don't Miss: Google is trying really hard to make a smart jacket you won’t totally hate The news comes from Taiwan-based supply chain sources who spoke to Digitimes. Apple has apparently moved the production of its 10.5-inch iPad to March instead of the earlier May-June estimate that came from the same Digitimes’ sources. The 10.5-inch iPad Pro will target education and business markets, the report says. Apple is expected to sell one million units in March, and ramp up production to 1.2 million units in the following months. The company is also supposed to upgrade its 12.9-inch iPad Pro, though it’s not clear when it’ll happen. Volume production for this model might kick off in May or June, the report notes. As for the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, Digitimes says that orders have been steady since February, with shipment volumes expected to reach 3-4 million units a month in the first quarter, and then grow “significantly” in the second quarter. Digitimes did not say whether any other products will be launched at the event, aside from new iPads. Apple, meanwhile, is yet to formally announce its iPad press event.

The change, reported first by MacRumors and confirmed with a support rep, is not yet showing up on Apple’s official product page for AppleCare+. But if you go to Apple’s eligibility tool and input your serial number from the iPhone’s settings panel, you should be able to see a new purchase option so long as you purchased the device within the last year. This now means iPhone insurance through Apple has the same purchase window as Macs and the Apple TV, but the Apple Watch and iPad are still restricted to 60 days after purchase. Considering Apple lowered the price of screen repairs through AppleCare+ from $99 to $29 last September, now is probably a good time to shell out for a little extra insurance in the event something goes wrong. Just be aware: you can’t go and crack your screen and then purchase AppleCare+ thanks to this new purchase window. Apple requires a physical inspection to buy the service in-store and a remote diagnostic test if you do so online.

Quadruple witching hour tomorrow. Be on the lookout for volatility - and call out headlines ascribing it to a really delayed FOMC reaction— John Kicklighter (@JohnKicklighter) March 16, 2017 That witchy event has been known to cause some volatility for equities — and there hasn't been much of that for a while, at least when measured by the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) . It’s been a busy week for POTUS — who has taken a lot of heat over the updated travel ban and his budget — and Friday’s G-20 meeting could bring him more flak on trade. Watch currencies as the U.S. side has been complaining over China and the euro. That brings us to our call of the day, which lays out one reason why you may want to raise a Guinness to President No. 45. Andy Hargreaves and the team at Pacific Crest have just raised their bull-case estimate on Apple (AAPL) to $175 per share. They base that on a key campaign promise of President Donald Trump. © Provided by Dow Jones & Company, Inc. Last year, Trump floated the idea of a repatriation tax holiday for corporations, meaning they could bring cash held overseas back home without a huge penalty. Should that become a reality, Pacific Crest analysts see Apple boosting its domestic cash balance by $204 billion to $220 billion. “If the U.S. allows offshore cash to be repatriated at a reduced tax rate, Apple could comfortably double or triple its regular dividend and still make a meaningful acquisition without impairing its balance sheet,” said Hargreaves and his team. With repatriation a reality, Apple’s current dividend per share of $2.28 could easily double to around $4.56, said Pacific Crest. A higher dividend payout would help support shares if the next iPhone cycle comes in a little less frothy, as Pacific Crest and others have cautioned. And this would help drive Apple to $175 per share, even if the next iPhone cycle is no great shakes, some analysts have said. While the Pacific Crest team lifted their best-case scenario price for Apple shares, they haven’t changed their base $140 price target. Of course, Trump’s repatriation idea has been criticized. By Société Générale , for one, which warned last year that even if companies get a tax holiday, they may not use the cash to boost shares.

Quotes in the article Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▲ 856.97 +4.66 +0.55% Apple Inc AAPL ▲ 141.46 +1.47 +1.05% All three are convinced voice-controlled virtual assistants have the potential to transform how we interact with our devices. Apple has Siri, Google has Google Assistant, and Amazon has Alexa. They believe that in the future, you won't swipe or manually fiddle with your device — you'll just talk to it, like you would another human. It's a radical new frontier, a change on a par with the shift from the command line to visual operating systems like Windows. So whoever gets ahead now has the potential to define the next major era of computing. Originally, the three have had slightly different approaches. Amazon, an early leader in the space, focused on its Echo smart speaker for Alexa. Google put Google Assistant both inside its smart-speaker Google Home and a few Android smartphones, while Apple's Siri was focused only on the iPhone. But now Amazon is coming for the other two, and trying to invade the smartphone. Amazon is creeping into iOS and Android through the back door© Provided by Business Insider IncKempinski Hotels On Thursday, Amazon announced that Alexa would be available in its main shopping app on iOS, letting users shop for items, control smart home products, and check the news and weather using their voice. A limited version of Alexa was previously available for iOS via a standalone app — but this opens it up to far more users who might not have otherwise sought it out. Alexa is creeping into Android phones as well. Amazon has teamed up with Huawei to bake Alexa to its Mate 9 smartphone, and the company is also working with Lenovo-owned Motorola to integrate it into some future Moto smartphones. This all amounts to a kind of Trojan horse. Amazon failed to get a foothold in the smartphone sector. Its own phone, the Fire Phone, failed miserably. But as voice-controlled assistants become more common, if people see Alexa as the leading option, it gives Amazon a way to control users' fundamental smartphone experience anyway.  When it comes to voice-controlled computing, it's all still to play for© Provided by Business Insider IncAmazon But this is way, way bigger than just phones. Google and Amazon are now racing each other to bake their virtual assistants into as many different devices as possible, from cars to home appliances. They're trying to get the kind of virtuous network effects that will reinforce usage and lock in their dominance. Think about it: No-one wants to have to switch between multiple, non-communicating assistants. They just want one to follow them everywhere they go, from their phone to their thermostat. So the more places a company makes theirs available, the stronger position they're in. And once a user is locked into a particular assistant, it's extremely difficult for them to swap — because unlike replacing a phone, you might need to replace most of the appliances in your house. It's just not going to happen, so the stakes are way higher. Microsoft's Windows won the PC wars, and Google's Android has dominated on smartphones worldwide (when it comes to sheer numbers, at least). But with voice-controlled computing, it's still all to play for — and Amazon is determined not to lose out.  Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

But it hasn’t ever talked about how much it pays them to do it. Now one of its stars has spelled it out: Chance the Rapper, who won the best new artist award at the Grammys this year, says Apple paid him $500,000 to put his “Coloring Book” album out on Apple Music, for a two-week window. After that, Chance, who isn’t signed to a music label, could do whatever he wanted with the album. So he put it out on SoundCloud, for free. Chance explained the mechanics of his deal on Twitter today: I wanna clear things up. @apple gave me half a mil and a commercial to post Coloring Book exclusively on applemusic for 2 weeks https://t.co/dMWwptrHHH— Lil Chano From 79th (@chancetherapper) March 17, 2017 That was the extent of my deal, after 2 weeks it was on SoundCloud for free. I needed the money and they're all good people over there https://t.co/5kIhv0YaKS— Lil Chano From 79th (@chancetherapper) March 17, 2017 I feel like if I didnt clear it up people would keep trying to discredit all the work we did to make Coloring Book what it became https://t.co/05v81I38ur— Lil Chano From 79th (@chancetherapper) March 17, 2017 I think artist can gain a lot from the streaming wars as long as they remain in control of their own product. https://t.co/6agVO3uIdf— Lil Chano From 79th (@chancetherapper) March 17, 2017 If you come across oprtunities to work with good people, pick up cash and keep your integrity I say Do It https://t.co/yF0gBPkLhY— Lil Chano From 79th (@chancetherapper) March 17, 2017 Chance’s tweets are noteworthy because the music industry is rarely clear about who makes what from music. They’re also the first time an artist has talked candidly about their relationship with Apple Music, which has roiled the industry by offering lots of money for short-term windows, which means albums won’t be streamed on rival services like Spotify. That practice has lots of critics, from both rival services and from music labels, which worry that keeping music on a single platform reduces its value. Apple execs argue that it’s just basic marketing and not a big deal — a message Apple media boss Eddy Cue reiterated at the Code Media conference last month. One sign that criticism may have some effect: Drake, who has prominently aligned himself with Apple Music, has new music coming out this weekend, which will be available on multiple services. One possible explanation for that change: Drake is describing the project as a “playlist,” not an album.

Rick Ross has recently released his album and it already made headlines, especially for the two tracks which seem to diss Nicki Minaj and Birdman. In a track titled "Apple of My Eye", Rick raps about Nicki and Meek Mill's past relationship. "I told Meek I wouldn't trust Nicki/ Instead of beefing with your dog you just give him some distance," he raps. Prior to this, Meek posted a cryptic message on his Instagram account along with his photo with Rick. "Rozay been told me don't trust you," Meek wrote in the caption, also hinting at the release date of Rick's album, "Rather You Than Me". Rozay been told me don't trust you. 3.17.17 #ratheryouthanme Sebuah kiriman dibagikan oleh Meek Mill (@meekmill) pada Mar 9, 2017 pada 7:22 PST Cash Money Records co-founder, Birdman, also gets explicitly dissed by the 41-year-old rapper. In a song "Idols Become Rivals", Rick is taking Lil Wayne's side in Lil Wayne-Birdman feud. "I pray you find the kindness in your heart for Wayne/ His entire life, he gave you what there was to gain/ I watched this whole debacle so I'm part to blame/ Last request, can all producers please get paid," Rick raps in the third verse. Rick and Lil Wayne used to be frequent collaborators in Cash Money Records, but in 2015 Wayne sued Birdman for $51 million over unpaid fees related to his unreleased album. Rick took to his Instagram account to show his appreciation to Lil Wayne. He wrote in the caption, "The Level of respect and Love that I have for WAYNE makes it hard to sit back and not speak on the situation. The streets need you. Being a Boss means having the courage to say the things everybody thinking but scared to say. I can't wait for you to hear it. Midnight."

Apple Music Ambassador Each student gets their own unique affiliate link. This helps them keep track of the number of people they recruit. According to one ambassador, Apple will give the students different tasks throughout the campaign. Students can share links to Apple Music on Twitter using hashtags like #MusicForEveryMinute. The student who has the best performance in each task will receive perks like three free months of Apple Music, or even access to events like the Apple Music Festival. Music on all your devices Details about the program are still emerging, and 9To5Mac reported this is due to Apple’s secrecy. Even the ambassadors they talked to didn’t get many details. One thing we do know is how ambassadors were selected. In some instances, students were contacted directly by Apple. The company also ran a Facebook ad campaign targeting students. For now it seems that this ambassador program is limited to university students in the United Kingdom. There is no word on whether Apple will expand it to more countries.

Apple will extend the window that users can sign up for AppleCare+ coverage from 60 days to one year after the date of purchase, according to a report from 9to5Mac. With extended AppleCare+ coverage, benefits include up to two free repairs from accidental damage like drops and access to private customer support agents via chat or phone. As 9to5Mac noted, the extended purchase period only applied to iPhones and excludes iPads or the Apple Watch for now. AppleCare packages currently run $129.99 for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 7 series, while they cost only $99 for the iPhone SE. AppleCare+ purchases outside of the warranty period normally require additional verification from Apple. These options typically include an in-store inspection from Apple or remote diagnostics from online buyers. Read: 2017 iPhone Models Will Have Lightning Port, Not USB-C, Analyst Claims The tweak in Apple’s fine print comes as the company is expected to release the latest update to its iPhone series later this year. While few confirmed details have leaked about the phone, the fall release schedule will potentially include the iPhone 7S and a boutique version of the iPhone 8 that’s rumored to retail for more than $1,000. With a slate of new iPhones expected to drop in Apple’s traditional fall release time, the company likely wants buyers to more easily spring for an extended warranty coverage.

Previously, customers had up to 60 days following an iPhone purchase to buy an extended AppleCare+ coverage for their phone. This information, originally provided by “multiple people familiar with the matter”, has been subsequently confirmed by a senior AppleCare advisor and other sources. The senior advisor told the publication that the extension only applies to iPhone, not to iPad, iPod touch and Apple Watch devices. For those devices, the purchase window for AppleCare+ plans remains limited to 60 days for the time being. As long as your iPhone is within its one-year limited warranty period, you’ll be able to add an AppleCare+ plan to your purchase. The one-year purchase window for AppleCare plans for Macs and Apple TVs has been available for some time now. Apple has yet to update the AppleCare mini-site with the extended window. OPINION: Simple math—why I never buy AppleCare AppleCare+ for most iPhone models is priced at $129 or $99 for iPhone SE. Customers get extended warranty coverage up to two years from the original purchase date. AppleCare+ plans also cover up to two incidents of accidental damage, each subject to a service fee of $29 for screen damage or $99 for any other damage. The change is retroactive: iPhones sold within the past year now qualify for AppleCare+. I bought my iPhone 7 Plus in November and Apple says the phone is still eligible for AppleCare. To see your warranty status and eligibility to purchase additional AppleCare coverage, enter your device’s serial number at checkcoverage.apple.com. To find out the serial number of your iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, iPod or Apple Watch, go to Settings → General → About. On your Mac, choosing About This Mac from the Apple menu. The new purchasing window for AppleCare for iPhone seems to be available in the United States, but not in other countries. We’ll update the article if, and when, new information becomes available. If you see the change in your country, tell us in comments or via tips@iDownloadBlog.com and we’ll update the article.

Previously, customers purchasing a new iPhone had up to 60 days to decide whether or not to purchase Apple’s AppleCare+ protection plan, which increases the covered iPhone’s warranty coverage and telephone support to two years from the date of the device’s purchase and provides coverage for up to two incidents of accidental damage during the coverage period. Customers purchasing AppleCare+ separately from an iPhone will be required to provide a proof of purchase and either have Apple physically inspect the device in an Apple Store, or run a remote diagnostic when purchasing online. Although Apple has not yet updated its web site to reflect this change, MacRumors was able to confirm the extension with a senior AppleCare advisor. The advisor noted that the extension only applies to the iPhone, and not the iPad, iPod touch, or Apple Watch, for which the time limit on purchasing AppleCare+ remains at 60 days.

For the most part, the section helps iOS users bypass the App Store’s overwhelming amount of choice to find gaming gems they may not have heard of before. Apple says it will regularly update the section with new titles. Notably, however, Apple has also discounted several noteworthy titles to just $1.39, including Botanicula, a beautiful plant-inspired adventure game from the creators Machinarium; The Room Two, a game that needs no introduction with an aggregate five star score after 580 reviews; and Prune, Apple’s 2015 iPad game of the year winner. Also highlighted is Oxenfree, which just launched on iOS. Check out Apple’s entire indie games celebration page on the iTunes App Store to see all the other highlighted and discounted titles.

WikiLeaks Won’t Tell Tech Companies How to Patch CIA Zero-Days Until Its Demands Are Met A partnership between the secret-spilling group and Google, Microsoft, and Apple has already hit its first road block. Last week, WikiLeaks promised it would share the technical details and code of the hacking tools that the CIA has allegedly developed against Google, Apple, Microsoft and other tech companies. This week, after days of waiting, the secret-spilling site finally made initial contact with the companies. But WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange's attempt to help these major tech companies find out exactly what bugs and vulnerabilities the CIA is or was allegedly taking advantage of, and then plug the holes, is not going very smoothly for now. And WikiLeaks has not shared any data with them yet, Motherboard has learned. "Beyond making the initial contact, no information has been shared," a source familiar with the matter told Motherboard. This week, Assange sent an email to Apple, Google, Microsoft and all the companies mentioned in the documents. But instead of reporting the bugs or exploits found in the leaked CIA documents it has in its possession, WikiLeaks made demands, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity. WikiLeaks included a document in the email, requesting the companies to sign off on a series of conditions before being able to receive the actual technical details to deploy patches, according to sources. It's unclear what the conditions are, but a source mentioned a 90-day disclosure deadline, which would compel companies to commit to issuing a patch within three months. Read more: The CIA's Stash of the Dankest Emoticons The companies, however, are not sure what to do next because the vulnerabilities come from highly-classified documents (which may have been illegally obtained), as well as the suspicion that, perhaps, these documents and hacking tools were leaked to WikiLeaks by the Russian government. The CIA, for now, has apparently made no contact with the tech companies to disclose the vulnerabilities itself. In theory, since WikiLeaks has the documents, the CIA could assume the hacking tools are burned anyway, and disclose them to the tech companies in the event that criminal hackers or other adversaries figure them out. That isn't just a theoretical risk. Last summer, when the mysterious group Shadow Brokers dumped the code of NSA hacking tools, criminals quickly repurposed it. WikiLeaks for now hasn't published any code that would let people take advantage of those bugs—though some hacking code did leak. "WikiLeaks and the government hold all the cards here, there's not much the tech companies can do on their own besides rabidly looking through their code to look for any issues that might be related," a source told me. "WikiLeaks and the government hold all the cards here, there's not much the tech companies can do on their own." Other sources who work at two different tech companies confirmed that the matter is essentially stuck at their respective legal departments. The security teams are still waiting, according to sources. "WikiLeaks has made initial contact with us via secure@microsoft.com," a Microsoft spokesperson told Motherboard in an email. Google and Apple did not respond to a request for comment. WikiLeaks also did not respond requests for comment. The organization is known for imposing uncompromising demands on companies it works with. In 2011, Assange enraged a series of newspapers with its demands, even after they had already started collaborating . Assange also has a well known contempt for companies such as Google. So this process might hit a few more roadblocks. The CIA, on its part, declined to comment on whether it plans to alert the tech companies. Instead, a spokesperson sent a statement saying that the agency has "no comment on the authenticity of purported intelligence documents released by Wikileaks or on the status of any investigation into the source of the documents." "As we've said previously, Julian Assange is not exactly a bastion of truth and integrity," the spokesperson wrote. "The American public should be deeply troubled by any Wikileaks disclosure designed to damage the Intelligence Community's ability to protect America against terrorists and other adversaries. Such disclosures not only jeopardize US personnel and operations, but also equip our adversaries with tools and information to do us harm."

Home News Business Apple pays zero tax in NZ despite sales of $4.2 billion Author Matt Nippert for the NZ Herald, Section Business, Publish Date Saturday, 18 March 2017, 9:09AM Consumer electronics giant Apple paid no income tax to Inland Revenue over the past decade despite selling billions of dollars worth of iPhones and iPads to New Zealanders. The revelations about Apple's local tax bill - in addition to international concerns about its use of havens such as Ireland - have sparked concerns a recently announced government crackdown on multinational tax avoidance may not go far enough. Green Party co-leader James Shaw said Apple was not paying its fair share. "It is absolutely extraordinary that they are able to get away with paying zero tax in this country. I really like Apple products - they're incredibly innovative - but it looks like their tax department is even more innovative than their product designers," Shaw said. New Zealanders are avid Apple consumers - especially of its high-end iPhone handsets - and the company accounted for a quarter of the local smartphone market last year. According to figures compiled by industry analysts IDC, Apple sold 221,000 phones here in the three months to December. Over the past decade, mostly thanks to the iPhone revolutionising the mobile phone, Apple grew to become the world's largest and most profitable company. According to financial statements for the company's local subsidiary, Apple Sales New Zealand, record total sales here since 2007 were $4.2 billion. The accounts also show apparent income tax payments of $37 million - but a close reading shows this sum was paid to Inland Revenue but was actually sent abroad to the Australian Tax Office, an arrangement that has been in place since at least 2007. Had Apple reported the same healthy profit margin in New Zealand as it did for its operations globally it would have paid $356m in taxes over the period. In a statement issued from Australia, the multinational technology giant stressed it followed the law but did not directly address questions about the structuring of its New Zealand operations and the apparent lack of payments to Inland Revenue. "Apple aims to be a force for good and we're proud of the contributions we've made in New Zealand over the past decade. Because our products and services are created, designed and engineered in the US, that's where the vast majority of our tax is paid," the spokesperson said. Spark chief executive Simon Moutter said Apple's zero tax bill reinforced his concerns that New Zealand's tax base was threatened by the burgeoning wave of technology companies. "Some of these companies are willing to use every trick in the book to minimise the tax they pay towards the cost of running our schools, hospitals and social infrastructure," Moutter said. The Weekend Herald analysis of Apple's accounts was broadly accepted by experts former Inland Revenue adviser Andrea Black, senior lecturer at Massey University Deborah Russell and Auckland University professor Michael Littlewood. Apple's New Zealand operations are wholly owned by an Australian parent and appear to be run from there. A tax treaty between the two countries sees dual claims on income tax default to where the company is controlled. ussell, recently selected as the Labour Party candidate for the safe New Lynn electorate for September's general election, said Apple's tax arrangements were totally consistent with the law. "They're operating completely legally: it's just that age-hold distinction between legality and morality," she said. Revenue Minister Judith Collins declined to talk to the Weekend Herald this week. A spokesperson first said Collins was "unable to fit in" an interview, but later stated the minister was unable to comment on individual taxpayers. In a written statement, Collins said a "minority" of international companies were exploiting rules to avoiding paying tax and "we do not consider the amount of tax paid by these multinationals is fair". Earlier this month Collins released a package of tax reforms aimed at tackling the issue - first thrust on to the public agenda last year with the Herald's Tax Gap series - but it is not clear whether the measures will have any effect on Apple. "The new measures proposed earlier this month will help ensure that multinationals with a large internet footprint will be taxable on the profits from their New Zealand sales when they have people working for them in New Zealand," Collins said. According to LinkedIn, Apple has several dozen employees based in New Zealand. Shaw and Russell both expressed broad support for the Collins package but urged the consultation period - open until April 7 - not be used to water down the proposals. Littlewood said any public outrage over the fact that the most profitable company in the world paid zero tax in New Zealand would be perfectly understandable but not easily defused. "It is really is about as simple as that. "Whether something can be done about it is another question. The United Kingdom and Australia are taking a lead on this and it will be interesting to see how it works out for them." Both Australia and Britain have gone further than the New Zealand Government and impose a diverted profits tax on companies trying to unfairly skirt national tax obligations. John Payne, spokesman for the big business umbrella outfit the Corporate Taxpayers Group, cautioned against radical changes to the tax regime and warned the mechanism used by Apple was also used by local exporters. "It's Tax 101 in terms of activity ... and it's quid pro quo for us when we're operating similarly in another country," Payne said. Controversy over Apple's tax affairs has been raging for years internationally. The Australian Financial Review reported in 2014 on Apple's use of Irish subsidiaries to shift billions of profits out of Australasia. And last year the European Union took a dim view of Apple's Irish operations, punishing the company with a record $20b tax bill after concluding that it had used the territory to improperly pay a tax rate of just 2 per cent on its international earnings. - NZ Herald Related Peter Griffin: Tim Berners-Lee criticises the internet and Apple's tax controversy Peter Griffin: Tim Berners-Lee criticises the internet and Apple's tax controversy Pressure on Apple to pay tax in NZ Pressure on Apple to pay tax in NZ Friday Forum: 17 March Friday Forum: 17 March Opinion Rachel Smalley: Nia Glassie's abuser can't be allowed to...

Apple now details accessories by category rather than brand and provides a much more comprehensive list with external links and availability status. Sony A6500 You can find the newly updated site at apple.com/ios/home/accessories where Apple lists each supported HomeKit category so far: lights, switches, outlets, thermostats, windows, fans, air conditioners, sensors, security, locks, cameras, doorbells, garage doors, bridges, and ranger extenders. The revised site looks less like a traditional support document and more like a real directory for discovering compatible HomeKit accessories. Apple’s online store has its own HomeKit section, but not all HomeKit products are sold by Apple. That means this directory is much more comprehensive and includes several products that are coming soon or already announced to work with HomeKit even if they’re not available for purchase yet. The updated accessory directory joins Apple’s updated HomeKit explainer page that now includes a useful video for showing how Siri, automation, and iOS 10’s Home app all work. In addition to HomeKit accessories listed, Apple also details new home builders that offer HomeKit accessory packages for home buyers. These currently include Brookfield Homes, KB Home, Lennar, and R&F. Last week we highlighted WeberHaus as the first to offer this type of package in the EU as well. Apple CEO Tim Cook promoted HomeKit during the company’s most recent earnings call as well which we detailed in-depth here.

Home News Business Samsung needs its next phone to be a success | Mar 17, 2017  |  Vote 0    0 Samsung needs its next phone to be a success Samsung The Associated Press file photo Children try out Samsung's Galaxy S7 Edge smartphones at a shop in Seoul, South Korea. next play/pause pre Waterloo Region Record By Hayley Tsukayama Samsung is set to debut its next major smartphones on March 29. The new phones, expected to be called the Samsung Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+, are the company's first new flagship phones since Samsung recalled the Galaxy Note 7 over problems with exploding batteries. If history is any indication, it's likely the phones would hit shelves in mid-April. The timing of the launch gives Samsung several months of lead time over Apple's expected release of the new iPhones. This is an important launch for Samsung as it tries to rebound from the disastrous release of its last phone. The company's brand has taken a hit after the costly Note 7 recall, dropping from seventh to 49th in one year on the Harris Poll's reputation list of the world's 100 most visible companies. The company has taken steps to improve the safety of its phones, but a quality phone with killer features, particularly as compared to Apple's iPhone, could convince wary customers that it's worth returning to the brand, analysts say. Samsung hasn't officially released details about its new phones, but there are plenty of reports out there about what we can expect. •An (almost) all-screen front: The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are expected to have an "infinity screen" — one that takes up nearly all of the front of the phone — according to a January report from the Guardian that cited several anonymous sources. There is no home button on the phone, according to a report from tech blog BGR, which has a strong reputation for accuracy when it comes to leaks. The blog said that the home button has been replaced by a touch-sensitive control strip on the bottom of the screen. The screens on both models also curve over the edges of the phones, a design we've seen on Samsung's Edge phones. That fits in with the very small bit of information Samsung has released about the phone, which is a found in teaser graphic that seems to show an all-screen front and a screen that spills over its sides. The screen is also expected to be at least partially pressure-sensitive, very similar to the "Force Touch" and "3D Touch" capabilities of the iPhone, according to the English-language South Korean newspaper The Investor. •Rear fingerprint sensor: With no physical home button, the fingerprint scanner on the phone has to find somewhere else to live. While there were some reports in the past several months that Samsung would be able to embed a fingerprint scanner in the screen of the phone, leaked pictures that BGR obtained from an unnamed source indicate that the sensor has been relocated to the back of the phone. The new phones are also expected to have the iris-scanning capabilities that debuted for Samsung on the infamous Note 7, BGR reported. Samsung has said that there's no evidence that the scanner had anything to do with the Note 7 explosions. •Desktop mode: The new phones will have a mode that will let them connect to a monitor and be used more like a PC, according to an anonymous tip received by the tech blog All About Windows Phone. Users will reportedly be able to open multiple apps alongside each other, similar to the way Microsoft's "Continuum" feature gives users a computer-like work environment using just their smartphone and a monitor. •A new assistant: Samsung last year bought Viv, the company originally behind Apple's Siri assistant. So it makes sense that the new phone would have a new assistant that would perform many of the same functions as Siri, as reported by the Guardian. The assistant's reported name, Bixby, appears to have been confirmed by Samsung itself, through an Italian-language privacy policy published online that mentions the name. •A headphone jack: It's seems a little funny to celebrate a phone retaining a feature as basic as a headphone jack. But it's worth mentioning after Apple faced criticism over its decision to ditch the jack in the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Rumour had it that Samsung was also considering getting rid of the jack to help free up space inside the phone, but BGR's photos clearly show a headphone jack.

A new rumor today, however, suggests Apple could release new hardware as early as next week which would presumably happen without an event. Sony A6500 MacRumors cites “reputable supply chain analysts” at a “research firm” who believe Apple will release new hardware products sometime next week, although details beyond the date range are slim. Here’s their wording: Apple is likely to announce new products later this month, most likely between Monday, March 20 and Friday, March 24, according to reputable supply chain analysts we spoke to who wish to remain anonymous. The research firm did not disclose which products it expects Apple to announce, but rumors have widely suggested at least a trio of new iPad Pro models will be unveiled as early as this month, including an all-new 10.5-inch model with slimmer bezels and updated 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch versions. If Apple does refresh hardware next week, my speculative guess is that the refresh would include iterative updates and not major new products. Both the 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch iPads are due for updates if Apple is sticking to the 12-18 month release cycle, and the larger tablet is especially supply constrained and a few months older than the smaller version. Apple has historically used media events to unveil new iPads, but Macs have had speed boosts without events. The rumored 10.5-inch model would be a new design for iPads, however, which is more event-worthy. A supply chain report in February claimed Apple’s new iPad design might not be ready until May or June. Also rumored is a red version of the iPhone 7 and a higher capacity iPhone SE. A new color mid-cycle would be a first for the iPhone (not counting the delayed release of the white iPhone 4 in 2011) so a press release without an event wouldn’t be surprising. Upgrading the iPhone SE to offer 128GB of storage is also a minor update. Macs including both Retina iMacs and even the 12-inch MacBook are due for updates as well (not to mention the 2013 Mac Pro and 2014 Mac mini). Today’s rumor doesn’t mention or rule out an event, but it seems likely one will only happen if new hardware is ready to be introduced; updated hardware can launch with a press release and update on Apple.com. The rumor targets next Monday through Friday so we shall see.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Apple Valley boasts pre-recession unemployment rate Friday Mar 17, 2017 at 1:47 PM Mar 18, 2017 at 9:31 AM Matthew Cabe Staff Writer @DP_MatthewCabe APPLE VALLEY — The current rate of those unemployed in this town is the lowest it’s been in a decade, the signal of a strong and consistent rebound from the depths of the Great Recession. In 2010, the town’s unemployment rate stood at what Economic Development Manager Orlando Acevedo described as an “almost unimaginable” 15.5 percent, which was significantly higher than the 10 percent national rate in late 2009, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. More than six years removed from that calamitous spike, however, Apple Valley’s labor force appears to be nearing a return to its pre-recession normalcy with unemployment dropping to 5.4 percent in December. “Of Apple Valley’s 70,000 or so residents, our labor force is comprised of 28,600 folks,” Acevedo said. "And of those, 27,100 are employed, leaving 1,500 unemployed.” The percentage — down from 6.2 percent in December 2015 — is identical to the unemployment rates of neighboring Victorville and Hesperia, and is more than 3 percentage points lower than the 8.5 percent in Adelanto, according to town documents. The five largest High Desert municipalities experienced steady declines in unemployment between December 2015 and December 2016, the documents show, with Barstow posting the lowest rate at 4.7 percent. Overall, San Bernardino County dropped from 5.8 to 5 percent in that same period, which is slightly lower than California’s 5.2, but higher than the nation’s 4.7 percent, according to the documents. Back in Apple Valley, the unemployment rate is the lowest it’s been since 2006 (5.3 percent) and is currently lower than what was experienced in every year from 2001 (5.6 percent) to 2005 (5.8 percent). The continuance of what Acevedo called a “strong downward decline” — unemployment has dropped in the town by more than 10 percentage points since 2010 — comes amid year-over-year decreases in both industrial and retail vacancy rates from January. Industrial vacancy dropped from 3.9 to 1.9 percent while retail dipped from 12.2 to 10.8 percent. Office vacancy rates remained static at 4.8 percent, according to Acevedo. “There is another number that floats around out there as it relates to retail vacancy rates, and that’s the effective vacancy rate. And so if you remove the large big box like the former Lowe’s, or if you remove the portions of Apple Valley Plaza at the corner of Central and Bear Valley roads that’s not complete, our effective retail vacancy rate is 5 (percent).” Acevedo told the Daily Press in 2015 the shuttered Lowe’s and two empty buildings within the Apple Valley Plaza, as well as the center at the start of the Village on the southwest corner of Highway 18 and Navajo Road, comprised a majority of the town’s retail vacancies. At the time, those centers combined to account for more than 8 percent of Apple Valley's retail vacancy rate, which is based on square footage, and Acevedo said the failure of previous businesses in those locations can be attributed, at least in part, to the volatile economic landscape that followed the Great Recession. The current rate, however, shows signs of improvement as it’s now slightly lower than not only what was reported in December 2015, but in March of that year (11 percent), as well. Meanwhile, local businesses like Tonyan Coffee Roasters and Organic Teahouse & Cafe recently expanded while Rebel Oil Company, Dickey’s Barbecue Pit, DeeDee’s Hobby Emporium at the Historic Apple Valley Inn — along with eight other businesses — represent new openings within the town’s borders. And a Sprint store is soon to be opening in the Jess Ranch Marketplace, according to Realtors. The question is, will the recovery continue unimpeded? Respected Inland Empire economist Dr. John Husing said it may be next year before we see how Donald Trump's presidency impacts the region and the High Desert. "The policy changes that will emanate from Washington, D.C. will likely have a marginal impact on economic performance in 2017 given the time it takes for them to pass and go into effect," Husing said. "It is in 2018 that the major effects will likely be felt. For the Inland Empire, the question is the extent that potential changes will make the area’s economy stronger or more vulnerable starting in 2018." Husing will address this issue in more detail at the Inland Empire Economic Partnership's 2017 State of the Region presentation at 11:30 a.m. Thursday at the DoubleTree Hotel in Ontario.  Matthew Cabe can be reached at MCabe@VVDailyPress.com or at 760-951-6254.

Roston - Mar 17, 2017 3 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit ColorWare has announced that iPhone 7 Plus owners can now get their phone restyled with a classic Macintosh look thanks to its Retro Edition option. According to the company, this style was its most popular iPhone custom design ever, and so it is bringing it back for Apple’s latest and greatest plus-sized handset. There’s a big catch, though. ColorWare, of course, is a company that enables consumers to have many of their favorite gadgets reimagined with different customized colors, and Apple gear is no exception. The company recently announced Jet Black and other color options for Apple AirPods, and now it is offering this returned retro look for the iPhone 7 Plus. It was our most popular custom iPhone ever and it's back! Fully custom painted iPhone 7 Retro available only at https://t.co/ghDpFXjLjH pic.twitter.com/koqv7lR5Zk — ColorWare (@ColorWare) March 16, 2017 As the image above shows, the Retro Edition features the same look as 1980s-era Mac desktops, including the creamy tan color, some dark faux vents running up the sides of the phone, and, of course, the classic rainbow-themed Apple logo. Sound great? If so, you better move fast to get your phone restyled, as ColorWare is only offering a very limited number of slots. ColorWare says it will give 25 iPhone 7 Plus handsets this Retro Edition design, each of them labeled with an ‘x of 25’ designation on the rear panel to underscore its uniqueness. Once those 25 slots are nabbed, you’ll be out of luck to get this particular ColorWare design. If you’re interested, the price is set at $1,899 USD, with shipping set for two to three weeks.

Gay Gordon-Byrne Is the Ringleader of the 'Right to Repair' Movement She's fighting against Apple and the video game industry to ensure you're allowed to fix the things you buy. Gay Gordon-Byrne has been a persistent thorn in the side of America's biggest companies. The person standing between the likes of Apple and John Deere in their eternal quest to monopolize the repair of the products they sell. As the executive director of Repair.org—a grassroots trade organization made up primarily of repair companies with fewer than five employees—she is the most important advocate of "right to repair" legislation that would prevent manufacturers from implementing artificial hurdles that prevent individuals and small businesses from fixing electronics. Gordon-Byrne has no background in politics and she shudders when I suggest she's a lobbyist, but over the last three years, she has become one of the most important political advocate for consumer rights. With some help from concerned constituents—a computer repair shop in New York, a farmer in Nebraska—she has convinced eight states to take up legislation that is modeled on a Massachusetts auto repair law requiring manufacturers to sell replacement parts and diagnostic manuals to the masses. In fact, her background is in computer leasing, not repair—which actually made her the perfect person to lead the right to repair charge. "I didn't have any relationships to burn, so i was able to be more vocal on behalf of the committee than those in the business," she said. For the last three years, she's been negotiating with potential allies—the Farm Bureau, for instance—learning the intricacies of each state's legislative process, and firing back against unsupported claims by massive corporations that independent repair is dangerous, illegal, or somehow against the best interests of consumers. "I've learned by default because there was no one else to do it. I learned to read legislation, write legislation, how to research the concerns that have come up," she said. "I have to go through my own devil's advocate process—are the manufacturers' claims really wrong or am I not seeing the issue correctly?" At the statehouse, one senator combed through a list of constituents who had written to his office to complain about not being able to fix their iPhones. To his great surprise, he knew many of them. When she and Kyle Wiens, CEO of the electronics repair information and parts site iFixit, started pushing for this legislation three years ago, they had no idea if they could get other people to care about state politics. Today, more than 27,000 people in three states (New York, Massachusetts, and Kansas) have written letters of support to their legislators. Gordon-Byrne forcefully strikes back against the arguments made by armies of lobbyists hired by trade groups to represent some of the company's largest corporations. At the end of the day, the only real argument against right to repair, she says, is one of greed: Companies are protecting their bottom line, not their consumers. "We need to keep adding bills because manufacturers can keep playing whack-a-mole with lobbyists if there's only one or two states," Gordon-Byrne said. "But if there's 10, 12, 16 bills—that level of pressure is going to be hard to ignore." After a day in Albany spent running from meeting to meeting with New York lawmakers and their staffs, I'm debriefing with Gay Gordon-Byrne, the woman who is fighting for your right to repair electronics. "If you take something up and you feel like you're an army of one, you might be able to get a whole army behind you at some point." At the statehouse, one senator combed through a list of constituents who had written to his office to complain about not being able to fix their iPhones. To his great surprise, he knew many of them. Later, though, Gordon-Byrne made her pitch to a staffer of a powerful lawmaker. She explained how most repair businesses are locally owned, how a bill to protect the rights of consumers to fix the things they buy would benefit the state of New York more than it would harm megacorporations that are largely headquartered elsewhere. The meeting was short; the staffer, disinterested. I asked her if she has more or less faith in the democratic process after these trips to Albany. "Oh, much more," she told me. "I really see the power of the individual. We're really just a handful of passionate individuals, and it can have a huge difference. If you take something up and you feel like you're an army of one, you might be able to get a whole army behind you at some point." This spring, state legislatures around the country will consider the legislation she's worked on. If any of them get passed, you'll have her to thank.

Ogg March 15, 2017 9:05 am EDT Print Email Tweet Stocks were indicated to open marginally higher on Wednesday, a morning that will probably be met with a rate hike by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) later on in the day. Even with the bull market now eight years old, investors have managed to buy stocks on every pullback. Those same investors are also looking for new trading and investing ideas. 24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports each day of the week. The goal is to find new investing ideas and trading ideas for our readers. Some analyst reports cover stocks to buy, while other reports cover stocks to sell or to avoid. Some color has been added on many of the following calls, and the consensus analyst price targets referenced are from Thomson Reuters. These are the top analyst upgrades, downgrades and initiations seen on Wednesday, March 15, 2017: Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) was reiterated as Outperform at RBC Capital Markets, but the firm raised its price target to $155 from $140 (versus a $138.99 prior close). Apple’s 52-week trading range is $89.47 to $140.28 and the consensus analyst price target was last seen at $142.69. Finisar Corp. (NASDAQ: FNSR) closed down 4% at $25.69 on Tuesday but was indicated up 1.3% at $26.03 on Wednesday. It was raised to Buy from Hold at Jefferies, and the firm noted that it believes that the recent soft results and guidance and weakness in Finisar shares stem from technical product issues that likely will be resolved shortly and concerns around China where it is confident longer-term demand trends will be strong. Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) was downgraded to Neutral from Outperform and the price target was slashed to $35 from $45 (versus a $35.18 close) at Credit Suisse. The firm likes the Mobileye rationale but feels the price of Intel is just too high. Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX) was raised to Hold from Underperform at Jefferies, but the firm is caving on a lower target by raising its target to $135 from $95 (versus a $143.19 close). This call is after Jefferies conducted a survey targeting consumers in Germany and India and found that the Netflix growth opportunity appears larger than the firm had expected. Occidental Petroleum Corp. (NYSE: OXY) was raised to Buy from Neutral at Merrill Lynch. This is just a day after Credit Suisse gave a similar upgrade to Outperform.

In a series of tweets posted on Friday (below), the Grammy Award-winning rapper, offered a rare glimpse into the sky-high value of exclusive content in the new streaming economy. The one-time deal for the critically acclaimed Coloring Book album also included promotion in an Apple Music commercial. Half a million richer due to the lack of record company involvement, Chance distributed the album on Soundcloud for free as soon as the timed exclusive expired. Perhaps, in his most poignant tweet in the thread, he said: “I think artists can gain a lot from the streaming wars as long as they remain in control of their own product.” Exclusives have become a huge weapon in the emerging streaming wars between Apple Music Tidal and Spotify. While Spotify has generally stayed out of the bidding wars, the other two have enjoyed some successes by aligning themselves with artists. Just yesterday it emerged Spotify might be about to fall in line with those streaming services on one major issue by making some releases available to paying customers only. Do streaming exclusives harm the consumer? Or are artists right to go with the highest bidder when streaming revenues fall below albums sales?

Problem Solving | 13 Mar 2017 | Listen  | Print  | Comment (11) How to Identify High-Performance GPU Apps on the MacBook Pro by Jeff Carlson Shortly after the 2016 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar began shipping, battery life became a hot topic. Although Apple boasts up to 10 hours of performance per charge, I wasn’t seeing anything near that on my machine. I’d get maybe 4 hours. For a while, Consumer Reports refused to recommend the MacBook Pro because of battery life, although their testing methodology was questionable (see “Why We Should Care about the Consumer Reports MacBook Pro Rating,” 12 January 2017). The upside of the tempest was that Apple was able to fix some graphics and battery life issues in the macOS Sierra 10.12.2 and 10.12.3 updates. One of those problems centered around the way macOS switched between the built-in Intel graphics processor and the discrete AMD Radeon Pro graphics card available in the 15-inch models. (Although I’m writing specifically about the 2016 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, the following discussion applies equally to any MacBook Pro with a discrete graphics card.) When you launch a graphically demanding app, such as Adobe Photoshop, macOS switches to the Radeon processor, which consumes more power. When you quit the power-hungry app, the machine is supposed to turn off the discrete card and switch back to the integrated graphics processor, which offers less graphical power but doesn’t chew as much battery life. Before 10.12.3, macOS wouldn’t accurately sense that the changeover had happened and would continue to drive the display using the discrete GPU. Since applying that update, my battery life has dramatically improved. Even still, though, there are times when it seems as if my battery level is slipping away faster than I would expect given the work I’m doing. If you’re experiencing something similar, here’s how you can determine which apps are using which graphics processor and potentially track down the culprit. You have a couple of options: First, click the Battery menu bar item, which will tell you which applications are “Using Significant Energy.” That’s a fuzzy indicator, however. You can be running an application that’s using significant energy and still be using the integrated graphics processor. So, a quick trip into Activity Monitor is more helpful. Launch Activity Monitor (located in the Utilities folder in the Applications folder; you can get there quickly in the Finder by choosing Go > Utilities) and click the Energy tab. At the bottom of the window, see which graphics card is currently in use: Integrated (the Intel GPU) or “High Perf” (the high-performance Radeon GPU). If it’s the latter, you may be burning energy faster than you want. To determine which application is causing the discrete GPU to run, click the Requires High Perf GPU column to sort the list of running processes based on that attribute. You may have to click the heading twice to sort it correctly; the caret to the right of the column title should be facing down to indicate that you’re sorting in descending order. At the top of the list, the apps that say Yes are your culprits. Quit those apps. Even if you’re not actively using them, their presence can keep the discrete GPU active. The Graphics Card indicator at the bottom of the screen should switch back to Integrated. You’ll notice that Activity Monitor also includes a Time Remaining estimate. When Apple released 10.12.2, it took the unusual step of removing this information from the Battery menu bar item (see “macOS 10.12.2 Sierra Focuses on New MacBook Pros,” 13 December 2016). Happily, you can still get that information in Activity Monitor. The estimate is still just an estimate, though, and shouldn’t be taken as gospel because macOS adjusts its energy management features frequently. Nevertheless, the Time Remaining estimate can be a helpful guideline if you’re getting close to the wire. Of course, if you have to use even a single app that requires the discrete GPU, your battery life will suffer, and there’s nothing you can do about it. Similarly, even if no apps are using the discrete GPU or reporting as using significant energy, the battery may drain faster than you expect due to other factors. Especially on the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, I’ve found that turning off keyboard illumination (expand the Control Strip on the Touch Bar to reveal the keyboard brightness buttons) and reducing screen brightness can make a big difference.   Fujitsu ScanSnap Scanners — Save your business time and money with our easy-to-use small ScanSnap Scanner line.

Is your MacBook Pro with Touch Bar getting less battery life per charge than you think it should? The culprit could be applications that are forcing it to use the high-performance graphics processor.

Receive comments via RSS Add a comment Richard  2017-03-13 15:31 This is brilliant and incredibly useful. I'm using a 2014 MacBook Pro but I've always wanted to see which of my application uses the discreet GPU. It looks like my only application that uses it is Lightroom. Safari has memory issues but they're not related to the GPU. Reply Greg  2017-03-13 21:16 Why would pgAdmin need the graphics card? It's the only app that was using it. pgAdmin can view Postgres databases. That doesn't seem too demanding. Is there any downside when the MBP is not running off the battery? Reply Curtis Wilcox   2017-03-15 13:08 I just downloaded the latest version (4.13) and also found it requires the "high perf. GPU." My guess it's because its GUI is made using the Qt framework and there's something about the framework that makes the Mac think it should use the discrete video card; every application made with Qt likely will do the same. I would report it to Postgres in case there's some setting they can use in the Mac build process to make the application *not* trigger use of the discrete video card. When you're not running off battery, the consequences of using the discrete video card are much less significant; you're using more electricity than necessary and may be adding wear to the cooling fans. Reply Tony Voss   2017-03-14 01:55 I use a 15" MacBook Pro as the navigational system on a yacht and power consumption is critical, especially when there is little sun or wind for power generation. For years I have used gfxCardStatus (http://gfx.io). This useful app places an extra item in the menu bar which indicates by displaying the letter i or n whether the integrated or Nvidia discrete processor is active. Pull down on the icon and it shows a list of apps requiring the external card processor. You can also switch between using Integrated only, discrete or dynamic switching. You cannot switch to 'Integrated only' if an app is already using the discrete processor. Some apps and an external display force discrete mode anyway. I have gfxCardStatus set to display a notification whenever the mode is switched. This is a useful warning when you happen to launch an app that turns on the discrete processor and comforting confirmation when you quite a culprit. I have successfully got app developers to remove unnecessary use of the discrete card and to fix an app that left it on when quitting. But if the app is no longer being maintained you may be out of luck - Bento for example. Thoroughly recommended. Reply Jeff Carlson   2017-03-14 12:17 I wanted to mention gfxCardStatus, but it's no longer actively maintained, and doesn't work reliably under Sierra (and maybe a version or two back). I used it for years, and wrote about it for TidBITS in 2011: Reply Troy T  2017-03-19 22:55 I've used this utility for years and continue to be happy with it. As it isn't maintained, it's less helpful in shifting sources of video drivers, but it continues to flawlessly show when the system is using discrete graphics and which apps are forcing its use. As long as gfxCardStatus still reports what's going on with the video circuitry, I'll strongly recommend it for anyone who is interested in stretching their battery capacity. Reply DelfM  2017-03-14 08:35 It's probably rare that you would be concerned about power consumption when you connect an external monitor, but my 2012 MacBook Pro Retina switches to the high performance graphics card when I connect an external monitor, even if none of my open applications need it. Reply Jeff Carlson   2017-03-14 12:14 Yes, I think all MacBook Pros with discrete cards switch to the GPU to power an external monitor. Reply Curtis Wilcox   2017-03-15 13:18 I don't understand why it automatically uses the discrete card when an external monitor is attached, Macs without such cards are able to use the same monitors. It also happens regardless of whether the external monitor is extending the desktop or mirroring the built-in display. At work, we always advise faculty to use the AC adapter when presenting from a laptop but it would be nice if they didn't have to. I don't have the ability to check at the moment but I wonder if screen mirroring over AirPlay or using 3rd party mirroring software triggers use of the discrete card. It would be a little ironic if they don't, given that mirroring by software almost certainly is more intensive than mirroring on a physically connected display. Reply David Redfearn   2017-03-14 13:57 I started looking at this data when I got my new MBP 15. One oddity I have noticed is that Apple Photos does not seem to use the AMD GPU. I have two Photos extensions (RAWPower and DxO) that do trigger the GPU when they are used, but when I am finished with them, the GPU is turned off. David Reply Jeff Carlson   2017-03-14 16:15 I would bet Apple tuned Photos especially so it doesn't need the GPU.

Vertigo now lets Apple Music members share music with friends on Spotify Apple’s original TV shows are almost ready for prime time Video Watch SwapBots spring to life thanks to augmented reality Apple Music is trying out influencer marketing. According to 9to5Mac, Apple Music has created an “Ambassador” program in hopes of promoting the streaming service to young people in the U.K. The Apple Music Ambassadors are college students with an online following who have been recruited to tweet on behalf of the service in exchange for an extension of the free three-month membership and other undisclosed perks. It’s unclear whether Apple will expand this program to other countries, or if it will focus on other demographics beyond college students. Apple Music Ambassadors are currently encouraging fellow students to activate their free three-month membership to Apple Music. The ambassadors will be expected to tweet three times throughout the campaign, according to the welcome email published on 9to5Mac. In addition, each ambassador has been given a unique affiliate link to track how many new Apple Music subscribers they recruit. Twitter @JosephEvans1011 Apple will reward the top promoters with other perks, like potentially getting access to the forthcoming Apple Music Festival, which took place in the U.K. last year. Apple is said to have recruited these ambassadors via a targeted Facebook campaign asking U.K. students to apply. In addition, Apple partnered with Social Chain, a U.K.-based ad firm with a special focus on influencer marketing, which is basically rallying a bunch of popular people on social media to share promotional content about different brands. Social Chain has also worked with Spotify, Microsoft, and Huawei.  The marketing firm got itself into some hot water recently. The U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority found that Social Chain’s influencers had sometimes failed to disclose that some content they were sharing was actually paid-for advertising.  To comment on this article and other Macworld content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.

Apple has yet to update the fine print on its website, but MacRumors confirmed the extension with a senior AppleCare advisor. The change means that AppleCare+ can now be added to an iPhone as long as the device remains within its standard one-year limited warranty period. This brings AppleCare+ for iPhone in line with AppleCare for Mac and Apple TV, which can also be purchased up to one year after those devices are purchased. The senior advisor said the extension only applies to the iPhone, and it is retroactive, meaning iPhones sold within the past year qualify for AppleCare+ now. Multiple sources insist that the one-year AppleCare+ purchase window applies to the iPad, iPod touch, and Apple Watch as well, but we cannot confirm this info yet. Apple's eligibility tool does appear to reflect the change for iPhones in the United States, but not in the United Kingdom, Canada, Hong Kong, or elsewhere, so it is possible the longer purchase window will be U.S. only. "Eligible for AppleCare+" did not appear for an iPad or Apple Watch in any country based on our check. iPhone 7 Plus purchased on September 21, 2016 eligible for AppleCare+ AppleCare+ costs $129 for iPhone 6s and newer and $99 for iPhone SE. The plan extends an iPhone's warranty coverage to two years from the original purchase date of the device, and adds up to two incidents of accidental damage coverage, each subject to a service fee of $29 for screen damage, or $99 for any other damage. AppleCare+ for iPhone also provides 24/7 priority access to AppleCare advisors via chat or phone for up to two years after the device's original purchase date. Without the plan, iPhone owners are covered by a limited one-year warranty and 90 days of complimentary telephone support. AppleCare+ for iPhone also covers EarPods, Lightning to USB cables, and batteries that retain less than 80 percent of their original capacity. In order to purchase AppleCare+ after the fact, separately from the iPhone, Apple must physically inspect the device to ensure there is no existing damage. Proof of purchase, such as a receipt, is also required. If purchased online, Apple requires customers to verify their serial number and run a remote diagnostic test.

There's a reason these warranties exist, and it's not to help you. Rating: 19 Votes AppleFan360 4 days ago at 01:06 pm Well that's pretty darn awesome. Good work Apple. Rating: 13 Votes BenTrovato 3 days ago at 07:30 am You would be incorrect. One replacement cost without AC+ is more than AC+ and the deductible. If I break my iPad Pro 9.7 twice with AC+, I'm out $200 total. Without it, $758. My iPhone, $329 vs $619. It's just like your home and auto insurance, hoping you never have to use it, but there when needed. Exactly you proved the other persons point. Insurance is always calculated to benefit the company not the consumer. Apple calculated how to turn this into another revenue stream and settled on these figures to profit from it. Mathematically, the consumer never profits from insurance. As others have said, in the long run, you come out ahead paying WHEN it breaks, not paying in advance for IF it breaks. Rating: 5 Votes Joe Rossignol 3 days ago at 01:55 pm I like the new policy. I wish it was retroactive, seeing how I purchased said AC+ two months ago. I like the new policy.

Rating: 3 Votes mlody 3 days ago at 04:45 pm If Apple could only remove the AC+ from their upgrade program (therefore lower the monthly cost) I would be all over it.

In the original post he mentioned there are no extra months, he just said it'd be nice if that's how it worked lol. jeez. I agree, too bad it doesn't work like that though, I'd go to the last minute ;) Just to continue the beating, in his original post he actually wished it was retroactive since he already purchased it a few months ago (I'm honestly not even sure what he was intending to mean by that...) But why would you wait till the last minute? o_O All that does is not insure you for the first year and not get any sort of pro-rated discount for the second year. So you're at risk for 12 months and then even assuming you didn't incur any damage in the first year you can only buy 1 year of insurance for the cost of 2 year insurance... :confused: Sound terrible to me Edit: whoops I confused myself on what you had meant. I got carried away, but my first point still stands that you'd go 1 year at risk without insurance. Rating: 2 Votes Channan 3 days ago at 02:21 pm I understand all that. You misunderstood what I was conveying (probably my fault there). I purchased AC+ for my iPhone 7+ on 12/11/16. If the new policy had been in place then, I would not have purchased said care for a year. Give that I did so on the date I did due to the policy at that time, it would have been nice (although not realistic) to have the extra months added to my current warranty of AC+. I am not complaining mind you. I was just opining in a fanciful manner. Yeah then I don't understand what you mean by extra months added to your current warranty. There are no extra months. No matter how long after buying an iPhone that you purchase AC+, your warranty is going to end on the same day. Whatever day your warranty ends right now with you buying AC+ in December, even if you bought it right now, it would still end on the same day. If you're going to get AC+ regardless, it's much better to get it ASAP so you don't go longer without having accident protection. Rating: 2 Votes BenTrovato 3 days ago at 11:26 am He proved me right, it has happened to me and each time it was never my fault. AC+ isn't just about damages either, it extends coverage for an additional year for defects which would have saved me a huge headache with Apple and my old 6+ (and the reason why I now get AC+) Just ball parking.. If I purchased AC for only my Apple products since 2007, it would cost me over $2000. My out of warranty repairs in that time period have been under $500. It's a no brainer for me not to buy it but I understand how insurance works having studied it and know it does not pay in the long term. Others may have had different experiences. Rating: 2 Votes Joe Rossignol 3 days ago at 02:05 pm Awesome!!!! Can you buy it on replacement devices? Meaning if I already got a warranty replacement, will they let me buy AC+?

PHOTOGRAPHY BY JOEL LERNER/JWC MEDIA LAKE FOREST– In an atrium overflowing with elated students, faculty, staff, and parents, officials from the Golden Apple Foundation surprised Lake Forest Country Day School (LFCDS) Music Teacher and Fine Arts Chair Scott Baeseman on Friday morning, March 17, as they announced him as a 2017 Golden Apple Award winner. This is Mr. Baeseman’s third time to be honored by the Golden Apple Foundation as a finalist and his first win. Winners are awarded a semester sabbatical at Northwestern University and a $5,000 cash award. More importantly, recipients become Fellows of the Golden Apple Academy of Educators, providing them a stronger voice and a larger stage from which to make a difference in education. Established in 1986, this prestigious award is given out each year and recognizes outstanding teachers for their contributions to building a stronger, better educated society. This year’s ten winners were selected from more than 600 nominees. The finalists underwent a rigorous final round of review which includes classroom observations and interviews with colleagues, supervisors, students, and parents. The LFCDS community is pleased that Mr. Baeseman’s efforts in the classroom and beyond have been honored in this way. When asked to describe Mr. Baeseman, students and faculty alike praised Mr. Baeseman for his authenticity, professionalism, creativity, personal investment in his students, and innovation in the classroom. As a teacher, Mr. Baeseman is known not only for the excellence of his curriculum and his choral program; he also believes the art of teaching is an opportunity to create an environment that is essential to understanding how compassion and empathy may be used to bridge gaps between people. He knows his students as people, and is committed to coaching every student to achieve greatness. “I want our students to perceive how understanding diversity will not only open up their minds to new ways of thinking, it will also enrich their friendships, travel experiences, educational journeys, career options, and overall quality of life,” said Mr. Baeseman. “Music is a natural way to introduce a variety of cultures and types of people. Through careful discussion and analysis of music from different cultures, the students quickly learn that our job together is to unpack the meaning and recognize the music’s validity for a group of people.” Each day, Mr. Baeseman ends his music classes by encouraging his students to “go out and make a positive difference in the world,” a sentiment he embodies through his teaching and his leadership. A professional composer, his classroom models respect, trust, and supportive interaction. He is a leader in the School community, serving as the Chair of the Diversity Committee, and publishing a diversity newsletter each month that goes out to all School faculty and staff. “Teaching has always been my calling, and I feel fortunate to be able to share my passion for music with my students every day,” said Mr. Baeseman. “I am humbled and honored to be recognized in this way. I feel as though I should be sharing this award with my extraordinary colleagues whose support makes everything possible. Being a part of the Golden Apple family allows access to extraordinary professional development that will ensure our students receive the very best tools for their music education.” Head of School Bob Whelan congratulated Mr. Baeseman on behalf of the entire School. “Scott exemplifies the inspired teaching, academic rigor, attention to individual needs, and commitment to responsible citizenship that are at the core of our mission,” said Mr. Whelan. “His passion for teaching and learning create a lasting connection with each person he meets.” As a premier independent school for students age two through Grade 8, Lake Forest Country Day School is dedicated to producing students of strong character with a passion for learning. Founded in 1888, Lake Forest Country Day School has continuously served more than thirty communities by providing a broad array of educational opportunities in an environment guided by the core values of excellence, participation, partnership, responsibility, and diversity.

The Apple rumor mills are constantly churning, but they appear to be gaining steam this week with reports of new iPad models being tested in the wild. Four new iPad model numbers showed up in analytics data from mobile marketing firm Fiksu, TechCrunch reported on Monday. The Fiksu data originated from a handful of devices in the San Francisco Bay Area, suggesting that Apple engineers have been testing new iPads in public. All of the new model numbers begin with "7," whereas current-generation iPads start with "6." All of them also were running unreleased versions of iOS—either iOS 10.3 or iOS 11, according to TechCrunch. The Fiksu evidence backs up months of rumors from multiple analysts and industry insiders that have suggested Apple is planning to refresh its iPad lineup this spring, and possibly as soon as next week. Related Rumor Tips 3 New Apple iPads in 2017 Rumor Tips 3 New Apple iPads in 2017 Respected Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, of KGI Securities, said as early as last summer that Cupertino is planning to release three new iPad models, which could include a 10.5-inch iPad Pro, a 12.9-inch iPad Pro 2, and a "low-cost" 9.7-inch model. In January, Kuo also predicted that Apple is working on a new bezel-free version sized between 10 and 10.5 inches, in between the standard 9.7-inch model and a little smaller than the iPad Pro. MacRumors reported on Monday that the new iPads could be announced by March 24, citing "reputable supply chain analysts" who requested anonymity. Apple has remained customarily tight-lipped, and it hasn't invited the press to any launch events so far. Just about the only thing we know for sure is that it's been a long time since a major iPad refresh. Other than some storage capacity and price adjustments last fall, it's been a year since the iPad Pro was updated and more than two years since the sixth-generation iPad Air 2 was unveiled.

This week, new information about the device surfaced online, and it claims that the iPhone 8 could support wireless charging.More As rumors indicate Apple will release the iPhone 8 (iPhone X) with an OLED display screen this fall, a new report by DigiTimes says the company will receive 75 million OLED panels from Samsung Display this year. Apple and Samsung will dominate the OLED supply this year, by taking 70 percent of global production of OLED panels between 2017 and 2018, while other companies struggle to secure OLED panels for their devices. Read: iPhone Rumors: Apple's iPhone 8 and Future iPhones Will Feature OLED Panel iPhone By 2019 Apple’s 75 million OLED panels account for 14 percent of global OLED panel production for this year. Samsung will take 56 percent of OLED panel, thanks to its in-house production of the displays. Other Companies Facing OLED Panel Shortage Meanwhile, other companies are will receive smaller amounts of OLED panels because of insufficient supply. Huawei will only have 8 percent of its total production of smartphones featuring AMOLED panels in 2017. Other Chinese vendors, Oppo and Vivo will get 13 percent and 10 percent, respectively, of the global production of OLED panels this year. Read: Apple Jobs In America: Manufacturing iPhones In U.S. Is Uncertain Foxconn Chairman Says The companies are relying on Samsung Display for OLED panels, since other OLED suppliers won’t have the products of time. LG Display is expected to start shipping OLED panels in 2018, BOE Technology may not be able to ship its products until 2020, according to the report. iPhone 8 (iPhone X) To Come With Curved OLED Screen Apple is expected to release three models this year, iPhone 7S, iPhone 7S Plus and a 10th anniversary iPhone, which may be called the iPhone 8 or iPhone X. The iPhone 8 is rumored to feature a curved OLED screen that is “gentler” than screens in Samsung’s Galaxy S7, according to a recent report by Nikkei . The new iPhone is expected to be better visually but have less functionality. However, other rumors suggest Apple will stick with a flat display, which won’t take full advantage of OLED displays. Because the iPhone 8 will feature an OLED display, the smartphone is rumored to sell at more than $1,000. The iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus are expected to come with LCD panels. The iPhones are expected to be introduced in September. However, the launch date for the iPhone 8 (or iPhone X) could be after the other two iPhones, a recent report. Some key components of the iPhone’s rumored front 3D camera might not be available on time for the September release date.

If Apple fails to make the changes we have outlined above we will be very disappointed. by Karen Haslam | 17 Mar 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments Price RRP: TBC. TBC 2017 iMac preview: the specs the iMac needs We’re waiting for Apple to update the iMac, untouched since 2015. Hopefully when Apple announces the new iMac for 2017 it will address some of the problems with the current iMac. Related: 2015 27in iMac 5K review and 21.5-inch 3.1GHz iMac with Retina 4K Retina displays across the iMac range There are two different sizes of iMac, one with a 21.5in screen the other with a 27in screen. The biggest selling point at the time they launched was the 5K display on the 27in version, and the 4K display that arrived with the top-of-the-range 21in model. It is here we are hoping to see the biggest change - with the new iMac sporting a 4K display on all the 21in models, bringing the so-called Retina display to the whole line up. The current 5K and 4K displays are still excellent even when compared to the competition, so we don’t expect to see a lot of change there, but one thing many would like to see in the new model is the addition of DisplayPort 1.3 and Thunderbolt 3/USB Type-C (essentially these are one and the same). This would allow users use the iMac’s 5K screen with a different computer. The fact that people want to do this demonstrates just how good the screen is considered to be, and also the fact that as 5K (or 4K) monitors go, it’s actually quite a bargain. We shall have to see if this is indeed a possibility with the new iMac. One thing that people have crying out for for generations of iMac is the provision of more ergonomically friendly adjustments. Right now you can only barely adjust the screen, tilting it forwards or backwards very slightly. You can’t raise or lower it (unless you have a nice hefty book for it to sit on). If Apple made such adjustments possible we can see an iMac being used like a architects drawing board, which would require another change to the design… the addition of a touch screen. Will the new iMac have a touch screen? A touch screen is something some people would like to see happen to the display. These people will probably be disappointed if Apple is sticking with the philosophy of Steve Jobs that using a touch screen iMac would make your arm ache, but there is definitely a desire for touch screen abilities on some Macs. Perhaps this doesn’t apply to an iMac, but the ability to use a touch screen would be useful when commuting because using the trackpad on a laptop is difficult when you only have limited space. We can see some designers appreciating the ability to move elements around the screen by touch. We shall see just how important professional creatives are to Apple when the new iMac launches. Speaking of touch, there is some expectation that some of the features of the Touch Bar on the MacBook Pro could come to the iMac, although obviously not through the means of a built in keyboard. Perhaps the Magic Touch Pad (which was introduced with the iMac back in 2015) could incorporate some of the Touch Bar features. The processor in the new iMac We expect that the new iMacs will ship with Kaby Lake processors (unless the iMacs don’t launch until much later in 2017, in which case you might see Cannonlake processors). Chances are it will be powered by Kaby Lake regardless, because Apple tends to not make a big deal out of having the latest processors if the current line up is anything to go by. While the current 27in models offer Skylake quad-core i5 chips, the 21in iMac models are still using the old Intel Broadwell chips - which were old even when Apple shipped the 21in iMac. As we said above, this was because Apple the on system graphics chip Apple uses in the 21in iMac wasn’t available for Skylake at the time the machines launched. It does mean that anyone thinking of buying a new 21in iMac would be wise to wait until Apple launches the new range for 2017 as these are likely to jump two processors. Even worse, the current entry-level model ships with a 1.6GHz Core i5-5250U processor, which is a processor normally destined for a laptop, so don’t expect much from it. As for how good the new Kaby Lake processors will be, it is thought that the top of the range iMac is likely to come with a build-to-order option of the Ti7-7700 processor, and speed tests over on Tom’s Hardware suggests that that chip is capable of 4.2GHz under normal circumstances, and 4.8GHz when overclocked (don’t expect Apple to make overclocking possible). The current build-to-order chip option runs at 4GHz. Graphics in the new iMac As we said, the reason why the previous generation of 21in iMacs was limited to that Broadwell chip was because the 21.5in models offer a graphics chip integrated on the processor itself, while the larger model offers a dedicated GPU. The 21-in models come with integrated Intel Iris Pro 6200 graphics, while the graphics processors in the current 27in iMac are all from AMD - the Radeon R9 M380, R9 M390 and R9 M395X depending on which model you buy. As for the next generation, it looks likely that they will feature graphics chips from AMD's Polaris set, announced at the start of 2016. The Polaris chips offer improved graphics performance compared with previous generations. We doubt that the new iMac will be a better proposition to gamers than the current line up. Related: 21.5in vs 27in iMac and iMac 5K vs Microsoft Surface Studio comparison review RAM in the new iMac All variants of the iMac 5K feature 8GB of RAM currently, comprised of two 4GB sticks, with the option of boosting that up to 16- or 32GB. We’d like to see 16GB as standard on the high end, we don’t expect to see RAM capabilities extending to 64GB. Ports in the new iMac One good thing about the Kaby Lake chips is they offer support for Thunderbolt 3 and USB Type-C. Right now the 27in iMac will give you two Thunderbolt 2 ports, four USB 3.0 ports, SDXC card slot, a headphone jack and an Ethernet port. Thunderbolt 3 would allow users to plug the iMac into another computer and use that 5K display, it would also bring USB Type-C (which is incorporated in Thunderbolt 3) and obviously it would speed up any accessories plugged in. Storage in the new iMac Storage is one area where we really hope to see change in the entire iMac line up. We think that flash storage should be standard across the range, or at least a Fusion Drive (high-performance hybrid blend of flash and conventional storage) should be included. It is possible to pay £90 at point-of-purchase to add a Fusion Drive to the 21in models and we think that this should be standard as the Fusion Drive makes such a significant difference to the performance. This would be a significant improvement because the current 21.5-inch iMac range is crippled somewhat by its hard drives, which are a lot slower than the flash drives used in all of Apple’s laptops. Mac laptops with similar processors will perform noticeably better than the equivalent iMac because of their faster SSD drives. Added to this, the 21in iMac ships with an exceptionally slow 5400RPM hard drive as standard - that’s the kind of hard drive you find in a laptops (except these days you’ll be hard pushed to find a laptop with a HDD rather than an SSD/flash drive). The hard drive in the iMac undoes any of the benefits of the faster processor and graphics card. To be frank, we don’t think Apple should be shipping any iMacs with hard drives in this day and age, and while we accept that some people want the maximum storage available, and a 1TB hard drive is significantly cheaper than a 1TB SSD, Apple does offer the Fusion Drive build-to-order option that combines a flash drive with a 1TB hard drive, and in our tests this upgrade makes such a marked improvement to the entry-level iMac that we have always advised that people upgrade. It’s a no brainer. We really can’t fathom why Apple won’t just include the Fusion Drive as standard across the range, we were disappointed when the company reduced the size of the SSD element of the Fusion Drive in the 2015 line up and didn’t just offer it as standard. It was the kind of change that you could appreciate the company making if they were going to add it for ‘free’ not if they were expecting customers to pay for it. We certainly hope Apple sees sense with the 2017 iMac. Price of the new iMac Back in October Apple shocked us all by raising prices across all its products. Perhaps the increases shouldn’t have surprised us in the wake of Brexit, but the increases left prices at pretty exorbitant levels, going up as much as £400.   Prices currently start at £1,049 for the entry-level model, rising to £1,249 and £1,449 for the model with the 4K display. Given that the 4K iMac was £1,199 when it launched, you can see this is not a tiny increase. The 5K iMacs start at £1,749, rising to £1,949, with the top of the range costing a steep £2,249. It could still be said that the 27-inch iMac line-up is great value for money, if you were to purchase a 5K display of this quality it would cost a lot more than the price of the 5K iMac, and it wouldn’t come with a fast, capable, fully functioning computer. We hope to see the entry-level iMac fall back below the £1,000 level, but we certainly don’t hold out much hope for the rest of the line up returning to pre-Brexit pricing levels. OUR VERDICT The message of this article isn’t just to hold off buying an iMac for now because we expect a new range to launch soon, it’s also to say where we think Apple should be improving the new models. If Apple fails to make the changes we have outlined above we will be very disappointed. Tags: Mac , iMac Share this article Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi.

This time it’s from the patent holding company Soverain Software and it targets pretty much every product Apple makes involving internet-related services. Apple faces patent infringement case from Soverain Software The lawsuit uses four patents Soverain Software bought from OpenMarket: patents 5,708,780, 6,212,634, 7,191,447, and 8,935,706. The ‘780 patent covers session identifiers, the ‘634 patent covers authorizing permissions over a network, the ‘447 patent covers managing information transfers over networks, and the ‘706 patent internet security protocols. Soverain Software’s complaint says Apple is using the patents without licensing in the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Mac, iCloud, App Store, iMessage, Safari, HomeKit, FaceTime, all of its operating systems, and more. Assuming the company can make its claims stick in court, it’ll be set up to target pretty much every computer, smartphone, tablet, and software maker on the planet. While that would no doubt make Soverain Software’s owners very happy, it’s not a sure thing. Soverain Software has a higher likelihood of winning the first round because it filed the case in U.S. District Court in Eastern Texas, which is a court known for favoring patent trolls. Once Apple appeals, however, the case moves to courts that are less likely to automatically side with the patent holder. Soverain Software’s Bad Luck Considering how vague the patent wording is, Soverain Software may have a hard time defending them outside of eastern Texas. That’s something the company has faced before, and it didn’t work out in the owner’s favor. Soverain Software hit a brick wall in 2013 after targeting New Egg with a similar lawsuit. In that lawsuit, New Egg got three of the patents named in the case invalidated which killed Soverain Software’s case along with cases if filed against several other companies, too. Apple will likely move to get the patents in this new case invalidated, which will ultimately trim down what Soverain Software can use in lawsuits against other companies. That’s old hat for the company that earned itself the nick name “the shopping cart patent troll” after failing to win several infringement cases against a long list of defendants. That goes back to Soverain Software’s infringement claims against New Egg and other companies such as Avon, eBay, Macy’s, and Victoria’s Secret. The defendants chipped away at Soverain Software’s patent arsenal until so many were invalidated that the cases fizzled out. The recurring theme is that Soverain Software keeps losing, over and over again. Of course, it’s possible the courts could rule differently this time, but considering the track record so far this is going to be an expensive and unproductive battle for the company.

March 17, 2017 at 3:59 EDT PM wab95 March 19, 2017 Lee: According to reliably unreliable sources out of Eastern Europe a few years back, a tanker full of stupid spilt its contents into the water supply that specifically services the court house of the U.S. District Court in Eastern Texas. Payoffs were done and it was all covered up. Sources say the effects are cumulative and irreversible. One company came out with Smart Water (you may have seen in the market) to reverse those effects, but local government insisted the court house water was safe, and court rulings have been stupid ever since. Oh, and those sources also revealed that Nessie lives, but she’s migrated to Lake Erie. March 19, 2017 at 3:29 EDT PM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

The declaration came in a tweet this afternoon, as fans questioned Chance’s independence as an artist — a staple in his young career — given that the world’s largest corporation backed his last project. I wanna clear things up. @apple gave me half a mil and a commercial to post Coloring Book exclusively on applemusic for 2 weeks https://t.co/dMWwptrHHH— Lil Chano From 79th (@chancetherapper) March 17, 2017 Chance’s admission is the first time we’ve gotten concrete numbers on the payments Apple gives to artists for exclusive content. Back in 2015 it was reported that Drake received $19 million from Apple Music in his deal, which included a radio show on Beats 1 and becoming the de facto face of the streaming service. I think artist can gain a lot from the streaming wars as long as they remain in control of their own product. https://t.co/6agVO3uIdf— Lil Chano From 79th (@chancetherapper) March 17, 2017 As for the other players in the streaming world, Tidal gave each of its artist-owners a 3 percent stake to incentivize them to release exclusives on the service — and those stakes have become considerably more valuable now that Tidal is worth $600 million. Spotify doesn’t pay for exclusive content, and the terms of Amazon’s deal with Garth Brooks have not been disclosed. We’ve reached out to Apple for comment.

Like any app, the developers sometimes accidentally introduce a bug or compromise a user’s safety with a flaw. When these situations arise, we can forgive those responsible. Most of the time, the developers move swiftly and efficiently to fix any issues. But some security software is downright dangerous. Perhaps it’s not been updated in years? Or more worryingly, perhaps it’s malware posing as a security suite? In this piece, I’m going to list five “security” apps and tools that you need to delete right now. 1. Mac Defender Also known as Mac Protector, Mac Security, Mac Guard, Mac Shield. If you own a Mac, don’t listen to anyone who says you don’t need a security suite 7 Security Apps For Your Mac That Are Super Cheap Right Now 7 Security Apps For Your Mac That Are Super Cheap Right Now The apps on available in the massive Ultimate Mac Cyber Security Bundle make protecting your computer quite interesting.

The fake antivirus, called MAC Defender, specifically targets Mac users... Read More as your solution. The threat first became apparent in May 2011. Several reports have suggested it originated from Russia’s largest payment processor, ChronoPay. The scam is simple. If a user clicks a malicious link on the web, they receive a pop-up that claims their machine has a virus. The pop-up looks like an Apple window and urges the user to pay $59 for a license fee. If you pay, you can expect to quickly become a victim of credit card fraud. Mac Defender also inserts links and ads for adult content onto innocent websites, making it dangerous for kids. Luckily, the app is not self-propagating. 2. Security Essentials 2010 Not to be confused with the entirely legitimate (if somewhat underwhelming) Microsoft Security Essentials, Security Essentials 2010 is a rogue anti-spyware program. It has close links to another well-known fake suite, internet Security 2010. It also originated in Russia. It’s easy to accidentally install the software. It’s generally delivered by Trojans that fool users into thinking they represent an “essential Flash upgrade” for viewing online videos. Obviously, it doesn’t install a Flash update. Instead, it will download and install lots of additional malware, including the Security Essentials 2010 installation package. Once on your system, it will hound you with security warnings and virus alerts and ask you to install the software. If you give up and accept the demands, Security Essentials 2010 will run a scan and issue thousands of fake alerts, eventually prompting you to buy a license. 3. MS Antivirus Also known as ANG Antivirus, XP Antivirus, Total Security, PC Defender Plus, AVASoft Professional Antivirus. MS Antivirus is marginally less harmful than Security Essentials 2010 and Mac Defender. It will not steal a user’s information nor will it critically harm a system. However, like the previous scams I’ve covered, it will frustrate you with endless pop-ups, security warnings, and payment prompts. Removing this type of malware can be tough; often it will protect itself by blocking any removal tools from running, claiming they have a virus. You will likely see a message like “Application cannot be executed. The file is infected. Please activate your antivirus software.” To get around the problem, try running a tool like RKill. 4. Privacy Center Also known as Safety Center, Privacy Components. Privacy Center sounds like something you want on your machine, but it’s just more malware. The scam is unique because it’s the only tool on this list that can run in Windows Safe Mode How to Boot Into Windows 10 Safe Mode How to Boot Into Windows 10 Safe Mode Safe Mode is an inbuilt troubleshooting feature that allows you to fix issues at the root, without non-essential applications interfering. You can access Safe Mode in various ways, even if Windows 10 no longer boots. Read More . Its icon sits in the system tray but can grow to take over a significant portion of the desktop, often blocking the Start menu button. Closing the system tray icon is impossible. Many users have claimed their USB ports become unworkable when infected. Users often install it when they click on a fake video codec prompt, though in recent years, people have reportedly found it packaged inside another piece of rogue security software called PC AntiSpyware. 5. WinFixer WinFixer has not been active since 2009, but you might still have it on your system. Its issue is the same as the other four tools: false positives and fake licenses. But what made this malware particularly troublesome was how easy it was to install. When you saw an on-screen pop-up incorrectly alerting you to the presence of viruses, clicking anywhere in the window or on the X icon would install the app. As such, even if you knew the initial pop-up was a scam, you might still have unwittingly installed it. If you have an old computer that’s running extremely slowly, it’s worth checking to see if it’s hiding somewhere on your operating system. Choose Your Security Suite Wisely The apps I have discussed are all fake. But don’t think that just because you use a well-known “big brand” suite you will be safe Understanding How to Stay Safe Online in 2016 Understanding How to Stay Safe Online in 2016 Why do some users blindly wander the Internet with the bare minimum of online security software installed?

This requirement happened in the last three days and even though it’s not a huge deal, it deserves to be mentioned. The app’s most recent update, dated March 9, included only “various improvements and performance enhancements,” according to Apple’s release notes. Apple Store for iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch is available at no charge from App Store. Like Pages, Keynote, Numbers, GarageBand, AirPort Utility and other iOS apps from Apple, the Apple Store app is not part of iOS 10’s set of preloaded first-party apps so users must download it manually from App Store. If you already have the app installed and attempt to launch it, you’re greeted with an error message. “The Apple Store app now requires iOS 10.0 or later,” reads the warning message. The prompt invites customers to update their device to the latest version of iOS “today” and offers an Upgrade button that invokes the Software Update mechanism. Attempting to download the Apple Store app from App Store via an iPhone, iPad or iPod touch running an earlier iOS version yields a similar message saying the app cannot be installed because it requires iOS 10.0 or later. “You must update to iOS 10.0 in order to download and use this application,” reads the App Store prompt. iOS 11 may only support 64-bit apps because the upcoming iOS 10.3 software update includes a reworded prompt that now warns you after opening a legacy app that 32-bit apps “will not work with future versions of iOS.” In February 2015, Apple started requiring that any new apps submitted to App Store offer 64-bit support. Since June 2015, all updates to existing apps must include 64-bit support as well. According to Sensor Tower, 47,300 legacy apps vanished from App Store in October alone. The firm estimated that iOS 11 could kill an additional 187,000 apps later this year unless they’re updated for iOS 10, or about eight percent of all titles on the store. Apple is expected to reveal iOS 11 and other major updates to macOS, watchOS and tvOS during its Worldwide Developers Conference in June. Thanks, Joshua! Grab Apple Store for free from App Store.

You license it… igobythisname yupp! this has been an evil side of Apple since iOS 7 or so… very very bad & terrible!!! Bill How long till they require the newest iOS for all apps? I rather like staying on 9.3.3, thanks. Liggerstuxin Should have at least saved your 10.2 blobs. Bugs Bunnay any jailbreak tweak to bypass this? Jacques Bressin Try “App Admin”, but I had no luck on this app specifically. However if you havent updated yet, you would be able to block future updates to a specific versioN Nesar Just use there web-based store than the app. That way you won’t need to update iOS Jacques Bressin it’s a crappy move from Apple, I thought iOS couldnt start an app udapte if the required IOS version wasn’t good.

With Samsung having been involved in supplying components for the iPhone series, it is suggested that it has gained inspiration from this process and will ape one of the most distinctive iPhone 7 features. OLED 3D Touch Korean reports suggest that Samsung is working on a pressure-sensitive OLED touch display, and that this could debut in both the iPhone 8 and Galaxy Note 8. This 3D Touchscreen will incorporate the 3D Touch functionality that has been part of previous LCD generations, updating it for the contemporary marketplace. 1399156 / Pixabay Samsung has reportedly already debuted this screen at the Mobile World Congress, although it was obviously not part of the public trade show. Samsung supposedly gave a behind closed doors demonstration of the potential of this device, and it is now believed that it could make its first appearance in the Galaxy Note 8, before being part of the iPhone 8 later this year. “The latest technology boasts higher sensitivity and a wider range of pressure-sensing levels compared to the previous one used in Huawei’s P9 in 2015,” a source close to the Apple supply chain commented. However, it is not yet clear whether the new components will be ready in time for the Galaxy Note 8. While the technology is not quite in prototype state, it may not be prepared for mass consumption in time for the August and September release dates of the Galaxy Note 8 and iPhone 8 respectively. But it is obvious that both Apple and Samsung would love to embrace this in the next generation of their devices, as the new feature will effectively replaced the virtual Home button. It has been widely reported that both Apple and Samsung are looking to phase out this frequent feature of mobiles this year, and this new technology could obviously play a major part in this process. It would undoubtedly be a major filip for Samsung to include some form of pressure-sensitive technology in the Galaxy Note 8, as this was seen as a major innovation and selling point of the iPhone 7. it would also be an obvious way that Samsung could retain all the existing functionality of the Galaxy Note range while also removing the Home button. Dual-camera coming Elsewhere, it has been suggested this week that Samsung will include a dual-camera in the Galaxy Note 8. reports have focused on the Korean manufacturer updating its camera capabilities in an attempt to impress consumers ahead of what will effectively be a relaunch of the Galaxy Note series. It is notable that Samsung recently unveiled its latest high-spec Exynos 8895 chipset, and this features provisions for supporting dual-camera technology. This suggests that the chip will feature in the Galaxy Note 8, and that the chipset will play a part in delivering dual-lens technology. Leaks from close to the Samsung supply chain also suggest that the dual-camera technology that Samsung will include in the Galaxy Note 8 differs from some of the other examples already present in the marketplace. It is believed that the dual-sensor snapper that Samsung wishes to include in the Galaxy Note 8 features two differing sensors. The first of these is described as high-powered, while the other is low-powered. This suggests a similar setup to devices previously released by HTC. Considering that the Galaxy Note 8 should also include a significantly more powerful chipset, it is fair to assert that the photographic capabilities of the next generation device will be a big improvement over even the doomed Galaxy Note 7. It is easy to forget now that this particular handset was the recipient of excellent reviews prior to its exploding demise. Additionally, it is also known that the Exynos 8895 has the potential to support megapixel ratings of up to 28-megapixels for both rear and front sensors. Whether Samsung will take advantage of this remains to be seen, but it has led some pundits to speculate that the megapixel rating of the smartphone could be increased significantly over previous generations. Thus, the Korean corporation could inch up the camera in the Galaxy Note 8 to 16-megapixels, at least according to some reports. Forbes also suggested this week that a dual-camera had been considered for the Galaxy S8 before Samsung shelved the idea. It is not known why this decision was taken, or whether there were technological or logistical problems. Another possibility is that Samsung wishes to distinguish the Galaxy Note range from the Galaxy S series by including a dual-camera. But what has emerged from the Galaxy S8 generation is that Samsung has a prototype of a duall-camera module available. This means that adapting it for the Galaxy Note 8 generation should be feasible. And there is no doubt that the Galaxy Note 8 requires as many unique features as possible in order to stay relevant; Samsung already faces a challenge to restore the reputation of the brand after the Galaxy Note 7 disaster. Third product range expected Another interesting suggestion this week is that the Galaxy Note 8 may no longer be the most premium Samsung mobile release. Reports have focused on a potential third device release from the Korean manufacturer, featuring a luxurious design and quality beyond anything that Samsung has delivered so far. Reports suggest that this prototype could be unveiled at some point this year, although it may not actually become available to the public until 2018. It is believed that Samsung also showed off this device at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, with a private demonstration to a number of partners having apparently taken place. The South Korean giant is attempting to prevent leaks at this time, but there are strong rumors already circulating that this is the foldable device that has been so strongly anticipated. Samsung initially debuted this prototype technology at a trade show in 2008, and one decade later it could finally be ready for the marketplace. UPDATE 03-10-2017: As Samsung continues its preparation for the range of smartphones that the corporation will release in 2017, rumors this week suggest that the Galaxy Note 8 may be rather similar to the Galaxy S8 Plus. Samsung has yet to confirm either device, but it seems that the two phablet contenders will have a great deal in common. Trickle down Samsung is expected to include several new features in the forthcoming Galaxy S8 Plus, with the anticipation being that these will ultimately trickle down into a Galaxy Note 8 release later in 2017. In previous generations, the Galaxy Note has been more powerful than the Galaxy S series, with this contributing to the exalted reputation of the phablet range. But after the Galaxy Note 7 fiasco, it seems that Samsung is reconsidering the way that it positions its major devices. Murmurings indicate that Samsung may release two phablet devices during its spring launch, with the larger of these two, the Galaxy S8 Plus, featuring a 6.2-inch display. This would make the scale of the handset similar to that of the Galaxy Note 7, which had 153.5 x 73.9 x 7.9 mm dimensions and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7  - View Full Page Tags: Galaxy Note 8 Samsung Load Comments Latest News From ValueWalk First DAPL Oil Shipment Set for This Week, But Law Enforcement Costs Remain The Economic Toll Of High Suicide Rates In Japan And South Korea Robb Wolf: Wired To Eat The Rise of AMLO: Part II Copyright © 2016 ValueWalk - Privacy Policy Follow Us: Developed by ValueWalk Team Sponsored Content - Resource Center

In September, Apple confirmed the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, the successors for the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. The two devices come loaded with features including improved cameras, a new home button, and more. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus received solid reviews but they’re far from perfect. We’ve already heard about a number of issues plaguing the two flagships. Problems include broken Wi-Fi, busted Bluetooth, and abnormal battery drain. iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus battery life will vary from person to person but if you’re sure your device is draining faster than normal, you’ll want to take action. While your first instinct might be to head down to a local Apple Store for diagnostic tests, you might be able to fix your bad iPhone 7 battery life from home. There are a number of potential fixes out there and today we want to run down some tips and fixes that’ve worked well for us, and others in the past. How to Fix Bad iPhone 7 Battery Life This guide will show you how to fix bad iPhone 7 battery life and it will help prepare you for the future. Abnormal battery drain can emerge at any time so you’ll want to be ready for it. These fixes will work if you’re on an iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus and they’ll work on any version of Apple’s iOS 10 operating system. Here are a few things to try if you’re experiencing iPhone 7 battery life problems. Wait A Few Days If you just opened your iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus or installed a new iOS 10 update, and you start to notice weird battery drain, don’t be alarmed. This is normal and it could take a couple of days for your device to settle in. If your iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus is still exhibiting abnormal battery drain after two days it’s time to dig into the problem. Note that this can also happen after you install a new iOS update. Keep that in mind for future iPhone 7 iOS updates. Use Low Power Mode Your iPhone 7 comes equipped with a a feature called Low Power Mode and it will allow you to stretch out the last 10-20% of your iPhone 7’s battery life without killing off core services. If you’re experiencing abnormal drain or if you simply want to save some battery life, you’ll want to start using this feature. If your iPhone dips into the 10-20% battery mark, you should get a prompt that asks you if you want to turn it on. You can also manually turn it on in your iPhone 7’s settings if you think you need it before that. Go to Settings > Battery > Toggle Low Power Mode on. You can toggle it on and off anytime. Use Airplane Mode When You Have Bad Service When you’re in a bad service area your iPhone 7 will extremely hard to pull down a signal. This can destroy your device’s battery. To offset this, you can do a few things. If you’re fine with killing off all your services, you’ll want to toggle on Airplane Mode. Airplane Mode kills off all of your connections and it will help you conserve battery when you start noticing a huge drop. To toggle Airplane Mode on, you can head right into your Settings. It’s right at the top. You can also access it from the Control Center. To access the Control Center, swipe up from the bottom of your iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus. Flip off Airplane Mode when you leave the bad service area. Shut Off Location Services Location services like GPS can wreck havoc on your iPhone 7’s battery life. If you’ve ever used Google Maps or Waze you know what we’re talking about. To help conserve your device’s battery life, you’ll want to get a handle on what services are active on your iPhone 7. To do this, head into Settings > Privacy. You can turn Location Services off completely with a toggle off but we recommend going through your apps to determine what apps should be using your services and when. If there’s an app you barely use working in the background you’ll want to limit its capabilities. You can do that with a simple toggle. Check Your Apps You’ll also want to get a handle on your applications. If you use an app a lot, it’ll suck up your battery life. But if you’re confident it’s using up more battery than it should, you’ll want to dig in. First, you’ll want to head into your Settings and locate the Battery Usage tool. It’s located in Settings > Battery. It’ll show up under the Battery Usage header. This tool will show you the apps eating up your iPhone 7’s battery. If something seems off about an app, you’ll want to act. The first thing to do is look for a bug fix update. Apple’s developers have been rolling out a steady stream of iOS 10 support updates and these updates should help squash bugs. They’ll also deliver new features to your iPhone 7. If a bug fix update doesn’t help, you can try reinstalling the application. You can also try uninstalling the app to see if that nets you positive results. The Facebook app is known to be a problem so if you’re a heavy Facebook user you’ll want to weigh your options. Turn Off Push When You Can The iPhone 7’s push feature for notifications, email, and calendar can suck up battery life. If you don’t need push, you might consider turning it off to see if that helps your cause. You’ll find your Push Notification settings in Settings > Notifications. Once you’re there you can turn off push for the applications you don’t use and even some that you do use if you decide you don’t need the feature. Consider switching Mail, Contacts and Calendar to Fetch instead of Push. To do that, go into Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars and turn off Push. Manage the iPhone 7 Display Your iPhone 7’s display can and will eat up battery life if you don’t manage it properly. The iPhone’s auto brightness feature can be useful but there are times where it fails to work properly. And when that happens you will lose precious battery life. So if you start to notice abnormal drain, you might want to get a handle on your screen. The iOS 10 operating system on your phone makes this extremely easy. Simply pull up from the bottom of the screen to enter Control Center. From there, just use the screen toggle to adjust your screen brightness. If you don’t need the screen to be bright, keep it low. You’ll conserve battery that way. If you’d rather adjust the screen brightness in your settings head to Settings > Display & Brightness to adjust. Restart the iPhone 7 A simple restart could dislodge your iPhone 7 battery life woes. If you haven’t turned your iPhone 7 off for awhile, try restarting it. This fix has worked for us and others in the past and it’ll only take a minute or so. Reset All Settings If none of the above works, it’s time to take some bigger steps to help solve your iPhone 7 battery life problems. The first step we recommend is a reset on all of your iPhone 7’s settings. To do this, go to Settings > General > Reset > Reset All Settings and then enter your passcode when prompted. If you don’t have a passcode it obviously won’t prompt you. This process could take a few minutes and it will force your device to forget your connections (and passwords) but it might resolve your battery life issues. It won’t delete any files. Downgrade If that doesn’t work, you could try downgrading to the previous versions of iOS if a downgrade is available. Dropping down to an older version of iOS 10 won’t guarantee success but there’s a chance an older version will improve performance. For more on the downgrade process, take a look at our walkthrough. Restore from a Backup If none of that works, you can try restoring from a backup or wiping your iPhone 7/iPhone 7 Plus completely. This should only be used as a last resort because it’s extremely time consuming. Here’s how to do this: Plug in and backup to the computer or to iCloud. Turn off Find My iPhone – Settings -> iCloud -> Find my iPhone -> Off. In iTunes Click Restore. Follow the prompts and the iPhone will reinstall iOS 10 from scratch. When it completes click Restore from Backup to put your information back on the iPhone or Choose to set up as a new iPhone. Again, you should only do this if nothing else works. Take Your iPhone 7 Into an Apple Store If you don’t want to restore or perform a factory reset, you can also make an appointment to go see an Apple Genius at the Apple Store. Geniuses will be able to run some diagnostics on your phone and they could help you figure out the problem. A long time ago we took an iPhone 5s in and discovered a bloated battery was responsible for the battery drain. If you’re under warranty, and you are right now, you might be able to get another iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus for free. 4 Reasons Not to Install iOS 10.2.1 & 8 Reasons You Should Install iOS 10.2.1 If You Want Better Security   1 / 12 If you value your security, you'll want to seriously consider downloading the iOS 10.2.1 update on your iPhone or iPad.  The iOS 10.2 update brings 13 known patches for potential exploits. That's one more than its predecessor (iOS 10.2). These patches enhance the security on your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch making them ideal for those of you who store sensitive files/data on your device. Most people do. If you skipped the iOS 10.2 update and/or the iOS 10.1.1 update, know that iOS 10.2.1 brings their security patches with it as well. Again, the iOS 10.2 update had 12 important patches on board. You can see them all right here.  If you failed to install Apple's iOS 9.3.5 update, iOS 10.2.1 will also bring the three crucial security patches it delivered last year. These patch up serious security problems that could potentially expose your calls, contacts, texts, and emails. If security is important to you, iOS 10.2.1 is probably worth a download right now.   1 / 12 4 Responses 09/23/2016 mhd abdulla Reply After paying hefty sum to get iPhone 7, Now you want us to learn this trick.

I don not find anything called “Push” in Notifications! 03/17/2017 David Alexander Jackson Reply I think you guys should tell readers to do a complete backup of their information before you tell them to delete/restore settings . I may have missed that part in the article but I didn’t see any disclaimer . It would be devastating if somebody didn’t have a backup and followed the reset advice in this article thus losing all of their content .

Apple has committed to spending over 3.5 billion yuan (approximately $506.6 million) on research in China, with a focus on working with more local partners in the region to develop new technologies. As pointed out by Bloomberg, the timing is likely intentional, coming just before Apple CEO Tim Cook is scheduled to speak at an economic forum in Beijing. As Apple’s largest overseas market, success in China is crucial to Apple’s future. Additionally, China is the home of almost all of Apple’s hardware manufacturing, so the investment in nearby Chinese R&D sites certainly makes sense for reducing the gap between research and production.

In a series of tweets Friday afternoon, Chance said he "never felt the need to correct folks" regarding his relationship with Apple, but was inspired to do so after people had started to "discredit" his independence as an artist. According to Chance, Apple gave him $500,000 and a commercial in exchange for a two-week Coloring Book exclusive. "I needed the money and they're all good people over there," Chance said. The key to similar deals for other unsigned artists, Chance added, is to keep your integrity intact.

At this year's Grammys, Chance made history by bagging the Best Rap Album award: In his Complex cover story this week, Chance—discussing the possibility of selling his debut album—detailed the "unfair" advantage sales still have over streams on the Billboard charts: "I kind of hate the fact that I can't chart, really," Chance told Complex. "I can chart, but the way they have the stream shit set up is weak as fuck. It's unfair. And, you know, I don't know if it's— it's like 1,500 or 1,700 streams is the equivalent to one unit, and that's just, you know— that's unfair. Nobody listens to their songs 1,700 times when they buy it, fuck outta here. So, it makes it hard. I can't really— I can't compete with other people. Not that the charts matters at all, but like, come on."

Mount Sinai has published its Asthma Mobile Health Study, its first large-scale clinical observational study to utilize ResearchKit, Apple's framework for conducting medical studies using an iPhone. The study, published in Nature Biotechnology, collected data from 7,593 participants. The study compared its data with that of existing studies to make sure the self-reported data was reliable. The study included regular surveys to understand how asthma patients were affected by and treating their condition over time. A total of 7,593 people completed the electronic informed consent process and enrolled in the study. Eighty-five percent of them completed at least one survey, with a core group of 2,317 robust users who filled out multiple surveys during the course of the six-month study. Results were compared to existing asthma patient studies and to external factors as a control for the reliability of patient-reported data. For example, scientists were able to correlate increased daily asthma symptoms among participants in Washington State with an outbreak of wildfires at the time. Similar factors that could be corroborated in the patient data included pollen levels and heat. Data for commonly used asthma metrics, such as peak flow, matched what has been observed in other studies. Researchers have found that mobile studies like this is best suited for short-term studies that need data from different geographical regions. Smartphone-based studies also allow for increased data collection and rapid feedback from researchers to those taking part in the study. While this study has provided some important data for researchers, concerns remain. Potential challenges with this technology include selection bias, low retention rates, reporting bias, and data security. These issues require attention to realize the full potential of mobile platforms to advance research and patient care. ResearchKit was first introduced in early 2015 as a way to involve a greater number of people in medical research, offering the potential for greatly-increased sample sizes from more diverse groups of people. Apple partnered with a number of institutions to bring apps built with ResearchKit to the App Store, including Mount Sinai with its Asthma Study. 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2016 Mobile Nations • Terms and Conditions • Privacy Policy • Careers: Writer | Dev • Licensing • External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner

But people are suspecting that he’s signed to Apple Music, which he denies. When Chance The Rapper’s breakthrough album Coloring Book debuted as an Apple Music exclusive last summer, people assumed and even accused him of going against his independent music crusade by signing with one of the richest companies in the world. But, the album was only exclusive for two weeks before it became available on other streaming outlets including Soundcloud, Spotify and TIDAL. With rumors of him not being 100% independent growing by the second, Chance is finally addressing the rocks getting thrown at his throne. Earlier today, Chance spoke on his situation is a series of tweets. He revealed that Apple paid him $500,000 dollars to have exclusive streaming rights for the album for two weeks. To sweeten the deal they also produced a commercial promoting the album. But after that, the deal was done and they parted ways.

Smartphones with curved displays are trying to be the next big thing. But it’s not clear if consumers care. Quotes in the article Samsung Electronics Co Ltd SSNLF = 1,500.00 0.00 0.00% Apple Inc AAPL ▲ 141.46 +1.47 +1.05% Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy S8 – slated for an official roll-out on March 29 – will likely have Samsung’s latest curved display. On the current Galaxy S7 Edge, this means a distinct bend on the lengthwise edges, where the phone hosts a separate menu with special “edge” apps. It’s a key differentiator for Samsung’s Galaxy phones. It means the phone can offer more screen real estate without growing the size of the phone. And has an aesthetic appeal that other phones can’t offer.  Will Apple go there? The big question is what Apple will do. Will it offer a curved display like Samsung on its widely-rumored 2017 top-of-the-line iPhone, rumored to be called the iPhone 8 or iPhone X? Right now, analysts and sources close to parts suppliers are trying to figure that out. Nikkei, Japan’s largest business daily, offered up a report this week that claimed the next premium iPhone will have a curved display. However, the “curve will be gentler than screens in Samsung's Galaxy S7 Edge handsets,” the report said, citing a source familiar with the phone’s design.  The report continued: “While the curved screen will allow a viewable area of about 5.2 inches and make the iPhone even sleeker, it will not offer significant new functions.” It’s important to remember that the high-end 2017 phone isn’t due until later this year, so making a call at this stage about the final design is risky. Additionally, a new screen technology could raise the price of the high-end iPhone, potentially pushing its cost at or near $1,000. “At the end of the day, we don’t know what the special edition...iPhone will look like but we do know that Apple has decided to use AMOLED which is built on a flexible substrate and can be molded in different ways,” Wayne Lam, an analyst at IHS Markit, told Fox News, referring to active-matrix organic light-emitting diode display technology.  Does it matter to consumers? AMOLED tech allows Samsung to have curved displays, while Apple still uses more conventional liquid crystal displays (LCDs) on its flat-screen iPhones. “I don’t think the average consumer understands LCD vs. OLED, so I don’t think it will hurt [Apple],” Ryan Reith, an analyst at market researcher IDC, told Fox News. Indeed, other 2017 iPhone models may stick with LCDs in contrast with Samsung’s adoption of curved OLED displays for all high-end Galaxy models, according to reports. “Overall I don’t think Samsung having OLED across their portfolio will hurt Apple,” Reith said. IHS’ Lam believes Apple won’t go with a curved display unless it’s truly innovative. “I personally think that unless there’s a new innovation… the display on the special edition iPhone will remain flat,” he said, adding “And to be frank, there [is] little purpose [in] curving the display at the side bezels aside from aesthetics.”  “I think we’re all trying to split hairs at the moment with the curvature of the design of the display,” Lam said, referring to the three competing theories being reported: flat, slightly curved, or more conspicuously curved. Nikkei qualified its report by saying, “The design has not been finalized and could still change.”  Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

The company held patents for digital shopping carts commonly used on e-commerce websites, such as Amazon.com and collected royalties on these patents, but ultimately their patents were invalidated. Soverain had earlier acquired and used patents from a failed company called Open Market. Even though Open Market's patents were invalidated, the renamed company 'Soverain IP' has simply chosen another round of Open Market patents to launch patent infringement lawsuits against both Microsoft and Apple within the last 48 hours.   Soverain IP's formal complaint before the court tries to play up that fact that the failed "Open Market" company was owned by Professor Gifford of MIT who wrote fourteen patents that are now owned by Soverain. They claim that Apple infringes on four of their patents (8,935,706, 7,191,447, 5,708,780 and 6,212,634)   The lawsuit notes that "Open Market's groundbreaking inventions led to the issuance of patents that comprise two technology portfolios: (1) the virtual shopping cart portfolio and (2) the network management and data extraction portfolio. The below diagram shows Soverain's patents, pending patent applications, and the Soverain patents Apple infringes.   According to Soverain, some of the Apple products allegedly infringing on their patents include iMessage, FaceTime, Apple Handoff, Apple HomeKit, all of Apple's mobile devices and products using iOS.   The patent infringement case presented in today's report was filed in the Texas Eastern District Court. The Presiding Judge in this case is noted as being Judge Robert W. Schroeder. You could review the full lawsuit here.    For the record, it's noted in the court document that "Soverain is the owner by assignment and exclusive licensee to twenty-four issued United States patents, multiple pending patent applications, and numerous foreign patent assets."     For interest sake, in Soverain v. Microsoft, the same patents against Apple are used in this lawsuit with the exception of patent 6,279,112 being added which relates to a SharePoint Server and Office 365 technologies.   Notice: Patently Apple presents only a brief summary of certain legal cases/ lawsuits which are part of the public record for journalistic news purposes.

(GuruFocus) Related AAPL Don't Look Now - Twitter Shares Approaching Rumored Potential Takeout Price The Trend In Manufacturing Spending Is Good News For Skyworks Behold The iPhone 8, Bearer Of Good News (Seeking Alpha) Ross Levinsohn, a notable media executive with stints as the interim CEO of Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ: YHOO) and President of Fox Interactive Media, was a guest on CNBC Friday to talk about Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX)'s outlook. Levinsohn started off by stating he appreciates Netflix's original content and library, but its main problem moving forward is the simple question. "What is Apple going to do?" he said. "Nobody is talking about Apple. It's still a massive platform - the most important platform for content creators." Levinsohn said Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) has in some form or another hinting about its original content. However, the company hasn't come out with a formidable strategy even though it's the biggest name in content with the deepest pockets. The Other Event No One Is Talking About Levinsohn argued there is another event few people are talking about, even though it has huge implications in the competitive landscape. YouTube, considered to be the cord-cutting device for millennials, has recently partnered up with multiple major TV stations to stream live contact. There may be some good news in the end. Levinsohn doesn't believe there will be any "losers" in the space as the entire segment will be "re-ordered" over the next few years. But there will also be one disrupter and that's Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) after spending of billions of dollars on content with an immediate payoff in the form of Academy Awards.

Now, Apple is adding a new section to the App Store to better highlight these games from smaller studios, which can sometimes get lost in the shuffle of big-budget titles and free-to-play behemoths. The new Indie Game Showcase will feature new games and also highlight older titles, and will be curated by Apple’s editorial team in a manner similar to other featured apps on the store. In addition to the individual app showcase, Apple is also adding a permanent sub-section for indie titles to the App Store. It’s an important move on Apple’s part given today’s app economy, which is heavily tilted toward bigger developers who can afford the marketing budgets to promote their games in a way that smaller dev teams typically can’t match. Apple’s new indie section could help provide a more level playing field for new independent developers, similar to the early days of the App Store when the market wasn’t so crowded. Love the games we’ve debuted? Starting today, we’ll have a permanent spot on the App Store just for indie games. https://t.co/M7fhi8kU4D pic.twitter.com/d9Nt98EGvw— App Store Games (@AppStoreGames) March 17, 2017 Next Up In Gaming Xbox Live will soon allow custom profile pics Mass Effect: Andromeda is a thrilling sci-fi drama stuck to a boring game The wonderfully spooky adventure game Oxenfree is now on iPhone TypeShift is a slick and beautiful new word game for iPhone Five VR game genres to watch this year Good Deals: discounts on Dell XPS 15, iPad Pro, and more Now Trending Jeff Bezos looks a little too happy piloting a giant mechanical robot Drake’s More Life shatters streaming records with 89.9 million streams on Apple Music in 24 hours More Life is setting records everywhere Lewis Tan and the awkward case of what Iron Fist could have been This Article has a component height of 6.

News By Triathlete.comPosted On: Mar 17, 2017 A screenshot of the patent, which can be seen here. Bicycleretailer.com reports that Apple has applied for a patent that suggests it is looking to further its presence in the endurance space.  Apple Inc. has applied for a patent that would allow for an indirect measurement of a cyclist’s power output, by calculating wind resistance, road surface smoothness, rider position, heart rate and accelleration. The application suggests that by using these factors, gathered from a wearable device that has a GPS, accellerometer, heart rate monitor and other features, it could calculate rider power without the expense of a traditional power meter. The application, filed Thursday, might suggest that Apple wants to up its game against Garmin, which has seen continued sales growth of its wearables and bike-related products, although Apple’s Watch continues to dominate sales in the smart watch category.

Copyright Getty Images Advertisement Apple Inc. (IW 500/2) has revealed plans to set up two more research centers and boost investment in China, a pivotal market in which the iPhone has been rapidly elbowed aside by local rivals. The announcement comes as Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook undertakes his latest trip to a country that ranks as Apple’s single biggest overseas market. Apple said it plans to build new research facilities in the eastern Chinese cities of Shanghai and Suzhou, on top of centers already slated for Beijing and the southern city of Shenzhen. It also pledged to spend at least 3.5 billion yuan (US$507 million) on research institutions. All four centers will open later this year, the company said in a statement on its Chinese website. They will help Apple cooperate with local partners and attract talent from its local suppliers as well as from top educational institutes, according to its press release. The announcement came a day before Cook is scheduled to address a high-profile economic forum in Beijing, where senior government officials will confer with the heads of some of the world’s biggest corporations, including Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Saudi Arabian Oil Co. Foreign companies have a long-established tradition of building research bases in China to both signal their commitment to the country and curry favor with the government. Apple’s announcement comes after iPhone shipments fell for the first time in China on an annual basis, in 2016.

But local vendors like Huawei Technologies Co., Oppo and Vivo are now eroding its market share with increasingly high-end devices. The U.S. company is counting on the release of the 10th anniversary iPhone later this year to supercharge growth.

Co. Ltd. Announces 7nm+ Technology This contract chipmaker just provided some insight into the technology that it plans to move into production in 2019. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Mar 17, 2017 at 12:30PM Contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) has been on a roll over the last several years, bringing out new manufacturing technologies and subsequent enhancements thereof like clockwork. That pace of innovation has been one of the key reasons that smartphones have gotten as "smart" as they are -- those advances in manufacturing have allowed mobile processor designers to build increasingly sophisticated processors while at the same time keeping power consumption low (and thus battery life acceptable). Image source: TSMC. TSMC is expected to significantly ramp up shipment volumes on its 10nm manufacturing technology in the second half of 2017 (likely in support of the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) A11 chip), and it's likely that we'll see TSMC ship large volumes of its next-generation 7nm technology in the second half of 2018 (in support of the Apple A12 chip). At a recent event, per EETimes, TSMC just outed information about the follow-on to its 7nm technology, called 7nm+. Let's look at what this technology promises to deliver and what it means for TSMC and its customers, such as Apple. Area reduction, performance boost EETimes reports that TSMC is claiming a 1.2 times increase in logic density, 10% more performance, or 15% lower power than the 7nm technology that'll go into production next year. Such enhancements aren't huge, but both the increased logic density as well as the higher-performance/lower power should be clear wins. The additional logic density should allow companies like Apple to cram in more features and functionality while keeping chip sizes roughly the same and the improved transistor performance/power should directly translate into faster processors (improving user experience) and/or lower power processors (improving battery life). When will we see it? According to EETimes, TSMC plans to start risk production -- that is, small volume, trial production -- on this second-generation 7nm+ technology by June 2018. What's interesting is that it often takes about a year for TSMC to go from risk production on a technology to mass production. If it takes TSMC a full year to start mass production on 7nm+ from risk production in June 2018, that might cause schedule problems for Apple, which will need to receive chips to build up iPhone inventories well in advance of the typical September iPhone launch time frame. That means finished wafers of chips need to be rolling off the line and being shipped to Apple's contract manufacturers by around June/July 2019, implying production start several months beforehand.  So, if I'm reading what TSMC reportedly said correctly, the chipmaker can't afford to wait a year to go from risk production to volume production on 7nm+ -- it'll need to pull it off in about nine months to meet Apple's needs (assuming, of course, Apple sticks to its typical September iPhone release schedule). Looking good, TSMC One of the things that TSMC does well is that it routinely updates the investment community on the progress it is making with respect to future manufacturing technologies on its quarterly earnings calls. I suspect that the information that EETimes is reporting will be repeated on the company's next earnings call (which should be in April), and I bet the company will provide more specific production timelines as well as insight into the kind of demand it is seeing from customers for this technology.

Welcome to the odd universe of console hacking, by which we mean either jailbreaking or, failing that, making the machine do something interesting nobody knew was possible. For each new console these days, the story always starts as a race to be the first to find a way in. The latest honour has been claimed by a young Italian iPhone jailbreaker called Luca Todesco (@qwertyopriup) who posted an image on Twitter with the word “done” on the Switch’s screen below a laptop displaying the code used to make that happen. He had, he said, used a modified version of his own JailbreakMe tool to exploit an old Apple iOS 9.3 flaw in the WebKit HTML rendering engine used by a hidden, integrated browser. A second individual, LiveOverflow, quickly published a proof of concept confirming the discovery, while a third research group, ReSwitched, offered their own tool. This was unexpected. Statements by Nintendo in February suggested the Switch wouldn’t ship with a browser, something commentators immediately doubted. Without some kind of browser, how would users connect their expensive portable console to the internet through the captive portals used by hotspots? In fact, there was a hidden browser interface that could be invoked under special conditions such as accessing a Facebook profile or – yes! – using a WiFi hotspot. So the Switch had a browser of sorts after all, just not a very useful one. Sophos Home Free home computer security software for all the family Learn More We now know this happens to be vulnerable to a security flaw that Apple fixed in an update months ago. But does the issue have any significance beyond telling us that the first Switches entered the supply chain some time ago? The flaw in the WebKit browser isn’t on par with a full kernel jailbreak of the sort that would allow piracy or custom firmware, so perhaps not. Nintendo can also patch the issue with an update although when that might turn up is anyone’s guess. Nevertheless, Nintendo clearly isn’t paying enough attention to problems it should have anticipated months ago. It’s not as if software flaws in browsers are surprising. Perhaps the risk from consoles is morphing from old-style jailbreaking to “userland” attacks. In an interview with Forbes, Todesco speculated about the future potential to use Switch consoles for surveillance: “If there is a microphone you could use the switch to record and send that remotely.” Doubtless, a small army of researchers is working on that little problem right now – just as soon as the Switch comes back into stock, that is. To quote one sarcastic commentator: It [the Todesco hack] might actually be the first time in history that people could get their hands on a console hack more easily than on the console itself.

They only thing they did was redirect the wifi authentication page to something else. Reply Paul Ducklin says: March 17, 2017 at 10:46 am The PoC I saw takes it a bit further than that. As far as I can see, by forcing their own content into WebKit, they were utlimately able to call selected operating system system functions under the guise of the WebKit process. I’m not sure quite how much you can do with the access they acquired, but if you have a vulnerability that allows you to use a remote web page to trick a program on the device to run machine code of your own choosing… …then that’s RCE, short for remote code execution, so I think the word “hack” fits perfectly. My 2c. Reply Skeptic says: March 17, 2017 at 10:54 am Technically speaking, an HTML rendering engine (WebKit) is not a browser. You cannot browse the web with Android’s WebView. So it’s a matter of interpretation. When Nintendo said that they wouldn’t ship a browser on the console, they most likely meant a full-fledged browser that users can actually use, not an underlying engine that some applications can use to display HTML content. I tend to agree with Nintendo on this one, and not with jailbreakers who used the word browser very loosely. Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Enter your comment here...

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Sat, Mar 18, 2017 - Page 12　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Samsung led smartphone sales in Taiwan last year Staff writer, with CNA and Bloomberg Despite the widely reported explosion of several Galaxy Note 7 smartphones, Samsung Electronics Co remained the largest smartphone vendor in Taiwan last year, market researcher International Data Corp (IDC) said yesterday. A total of 8.74 million smartphones were sold in the nation last year, down 18 percent from 2015, IDC’s data showed. It was the first year-on-year decline in smartphone sales in Taiwan, indicating that the market has reached a saturation point, IDC said. Smartphones accounted for 95 percent of local handset sales last year, the data showed. Samsung accounted for 22 percent of total smartphone sales, followed by Apple Inc’s 20 percent, IDC said. Asustek Computer Inc (華碩) was the third-largest vendor, with an 18 percent share, followed by HTC Corp (宏達電), with a 15 percent share, and Sony Corp, which had 9 percent, IDC said. Smartphones with larger-sized screens dominated the market last year, with phablets that have a display of 5.5-inch or larger accounting for about 50 percent of the local market. Their share of the market is expected to increase to 84 percent this year, IDC said. Separately, Apple has revealed plans to set up two more research centers and boost investment in China, a pivotal market in which the iPhone has been rapidly elbowed aside by local competitors. The US company said it plans to build new research facilities in Shanghai and Suzhou, on top of centers already scheduled to open in Beijing and Shenzhen. Apple also pledged to spend at least 3.5 billion yuan (US$507 million) on research institutions. All four centers are to open later this year, the company said in a statement on its Chinese Web site. They will help Apple cooperate with local partners and attract personnel from its local suppliers, as well as from top educational institutes, it said. The company’s announcement comes after iPhone shipments fell for the first time in China on an annual basis last year, as local vendors, such as Huawei Technologies Co (華為), Oppo (歐珀) and Vivo (維沃), are eroding its market share with increasingly high-end devices. Apple is counting on the release of the 10th anniversary iPhone later this year to bolster growth. This story has been viewed 2628 times. Comments will be moderated.

Photo / AP Swatch Group says it is developing an alternative to the iOS and Android operating systems for smartwatches as Switzerland's largest maker of timepieces vies with Silicon Valley for control of consumers' wrists. The company's Tissot brand will introduce a model around the end of 2018 that uses the Swiss-made system, which will be able to connect small objects and wearables, Swatch chief executive officer Nick Hayek said. The technology will need less battery power and it will protect data better, he said. Switzerland's four-century-old watch industry has been adjusting to new competition since Apple entered its territory with the Apple Watch in 2015. Hayek faces the uphill challenge of trying to outsmart Google and Apple, which have fended off would-be rivals to their operating systems in smartphones and watches. Hayek's strategy contrasts with that of LVMH watch chief Jean-Claude Biver, who earlier this week unveiled an upgraded TAG Heuer smartwatch the brand developed with Google and Intel. Competition from smartwatches has hurt low-end timepieces the most, and Hayek has been adding electronic functions into Swatch's own less expensive brands such as Tissot and its namesake timepieces. This month, Swatch said it developed the world's smallest Bluetooth chip for use in watches and household objects. Swatch's approach will work better because it's trying to "think small" as one of the biggest problem for wearable devices is battery drainage, Hayek said, speaking at the Biel, Switzerland headquarters of Omega, another of 18 brands that Swatch produces. "There's a possibility for wearables to develop as a consumer product, but you have to miniaturise and have an independent operating system," the chief executive said. "I'm not convinced," said Luca Solca, an analyst at Exane BNP Paribas who follows the luxury industry. "People use smartwatches expecting to use the same apps they have on their mobiles. A proprietary operating system defeats the object." Swatch is willing to supply third parties with the operating system, which has been developed with the Swiss Centre for Electronics and Microtechnology, a university specialising in miniaturisation, Hayek said. The company has received about 100 requests for more information, with half coming from smaller Silicon Valley companies that don't want to be dependent on Android and iOS, he added. Separately, Tissot has yet to start selling its Smart Touch smartwatch, according to Francois Thiebaud, head of that brand. He said last year the solar-powered watch would be available during 2016, and that it would be connectable to Android and Apple smartphones. It also would have functions such as showing the weather. - Bloomberg Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Currency Compare and convert world currencies.

Users at the AT&T forums, Howard Forums and Reddit note that they've been unable to get Apple's video conferencing service to work on AT&T's new prepaid unlimited data plan. The company's postpaid unlimited data plans do not appear to be impacted, however. Given that AT&T has historically blocked Facetime on its metered plans to drive users off of unlimited data plans, users are unsurprisingly curious if the failure is intentional on AT&T's part to ensure users looking to use Facetime migrate to more expensive plans. But the company implies to Fierce Wireless that the blockade isn't intentional this time around. "We are currently working to restore FaceTime functionality for the limited number of AT&T GoPhone customers who are experiencing issues," the company says of the problem. AT&T's new unlimited plans for GoPhone customers already come with a number of significant caveats. While the plans do provide "unlimited" data, text and voice for $60 per month, connections via the GoPhone Prepaid version of this offering automatically throttle users to 3 Mbps by default. HD video is also verboten on the plans, as is using your phone as a mobile hotspot or a modem. Users looking for tethering, HD video, and speeds faster than 3 Mbps need to sign up for AT&T's $90 per month "Unlimited Pro" postpaid plan. It's certainly possible this is just a glitch, especially given that other video services don't appear to be impacted. If AT&T is intentionally blocking Facetime to drive users to its more expensive postpaid plans, it would be a violation of the FCC's net neutrality rules. The problem, of course, is that current FCC boss Ajit Pai has made it clear the current FCC has zero interest in enforcing the rules, and has an eye toward repealing them completely, eventually. Hopefully this is just a temporary, inadvertent issue and AT&T will be quick to resolve the issue. tags: wireless · AT&T Wireless Broadband · unlimited News Jump Comcast's Latest Speed Upgrades Reach Kansas City, MinneapolisCable Lobbyists Try to Kill Charter Merger Overbuild ConditionsNetworking 101: Network TopologyMonday Morning Links Verizon Kills E-mail Service You Probably Didn't Use AnywayGoogle Fiber Installs Are Being Cancelled in Kansas CityCable Companies Dominating Telcos Due to Sagging DSL Speeds»Facetime Doesn't Work on AT&T's New Prepaid Unlimited PlansA Closer Look at MultefireWeekend Open Thread!----------------------this weeklast weekmost discussed Most recommended from 45 comments adam1991 join:2012-06-16 Columbus, OH adam1991 Member 2017-Mar-17 12:23 pm Data are data this is deliberate, not accidental.

Like what if they just took the code for at&t's plans a few years back and pasted it into the gophone system for this new unlimited plan, and forgot to remove the facetime feature block... lazy! · actions · 2017-Mar-17 12:20 pm · Anon32604 @digitalocean.com Anon32604 Anon 2017-Mar-17 2:47 pm No hotspot No surprise Never used facetime but i simply do not understand why the prepaid unlimited nor unlimited choice do not have a hotspot feature. Att could add a small $10.00 charge to enable a 512kbps hotspot feature. If not mistaken that would be close to T mobile's hotspot feature. I have stated my opinion before on dslreports that a lepoard does not change it's spots and a fisherman cast bait before reeling in the fish he/she intends to cook and eat. Once the time warner merger is approved and at&t succomb to their power and greed i expect prices to rise on these postpaid plans perhaps not prepaid. · actions · 2017-Mar-17 2:47 pm · How about ..
