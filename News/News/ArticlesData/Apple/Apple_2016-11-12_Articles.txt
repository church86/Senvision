DAVID PAUL MORRIS by Troy Wolverton Apple is looking more and more like it's lost its way. Revenue and earnings are falling. Sales of all its major products are in decline. Numerous individual products are getting long in the tooth, waiting years for updates. Even for products that are getting refreshed, the updates are underwhelming. Some of this might be understandable if the company were focusing on new products that will likely pay off big in the future. But the last new product the company launched — Apple Watch — looks increasingly like a dud. Apple's long-baking TV project has amounted to nothing; the company's never released either an Apple-branded television or TV service. And, with every new report that comes out, the company's "Titan" car project looks more and more like an expensive debacle. Apple established itself as the premium brand, the one everyone envied, with an enthusiastic customer base. Under Steve Jobs, it made a concerted effort to reach out to new customers with lower priced products such as the iPod shuffle or the Mac Mini. Those worked the same way that an entry-level Mercedes does — they get people in the door and attached to the brand. Related Quotes 5 years 1 Day Last updated: Updating... Last updated: Updating...

Windows laptop makers like Razer recently have been releasing the kind of high-powered but elegantly designed machines that we used to expect from Apple. Microsoft just showed off an innovative touchscreen all-in-one desktop computer that's clearly targeted at the kind of creative professionals who have been loyal to Apple for years. And Google, Roku and Amazon are offering digital streaming devices that not only cost less than Apple TV, they support new standards like 4K and high-dynamic range video that it doesn't. During a conference call with financial analysts last month after Apple reported its latest quarterly results, CEO Tim Cook bristled at some pointed questions from Steve Milunovich, an analyst with UBS, about the company's strategy and direction. "We have the strongest pipeline that we've ever had and we're really confident about the things in it, but as usual, we're not going to talk about what's in it," Cook said. When pressed by Milunovich about whether the company had a "strong sense" of how the technology market was changing and how quickly it could respond to those changes, Cook answered curtly: "We have a strong sense of where things go, and we're very agile to shift as we need to." Despite Cook's assertions, Apple, the company that always seemed to know what consumers would want before they knew it themselves, is now making products that may seem cool in Cupertino, but don't offer what customers want and are priced beyond what most can afford. "Apple no longer makes anything I care to buy," Seth Lewin, a self-described longtime Apple customer, posted in a comment on a tech blog. "Apple could care less what its customers think or say or want, it seems." We got a glimpse of this last year when Apple rolled out the new Macbook, a laptop that's both costly, at least for its target audience of consumers, and crippled. The $US1300 ($1720) computer comes with an uncomfortably thin keyboard that's painful to type on and only one port that you can use to plug in things like external drives. You'll almost certainly have to buy some adapters for the computer, because that one port is so new that almost no devices support it yet. Oh, and if the computer's running out of power, you could be in a fix; you have to plug in its charger to the same port. We got another glimpse of Apple's cluelessness more recently when it unveiled the new iPhone, a device that was difficult to distinguish from last year's model, yet still priced the same. One of the few clear differences: Apple in the new model removed the headphone jack, a decision basically no one was calling for. It's a move that ticked off many users, worried others — and promised to make many folks' lives more difficult by making it that harder to connect the iPhone to older audio equipment. But the company's recent press event may be the best indication of how out of touch it is these days. In the past, Apple has used such events to refresh its Mac lineup, roll out new iPads or update its Apple TV streaming device. With many of its products in those categories a year or more old — and sales falling in nearly all of them, as best we can tell — you might have thought Apple would have updated several at least, particularly its lower-priced, consumer-targeted models. Instead the company updated one product — the MacBook Pro. That computer line was certainly due for an update. But the MacBook Pro is a relatively pricey laptop targeted at professional users, an important but niche audience. Even if Apple scored a direct hit with them, a new MacBook Pro line by itself won't revive Apple's flagging computer sales. The new computers have a cool feature: a touch sensitive bar called the Touch Bar that will display different buttons and features depending on what program is being used. But right now, the Touch Bar is only available on models that start at $US1800, a pricey sum even for professionals. And even as Apple was adding the new Touch Bar, it was taking away or excluding features that professionals want and need. Many potential customers criticised the new computers for being underpowered in terms of their graphics processors and the amount of memory they can support. Others hated the fact that the new computers, like the Macbook before them, only have USB-C ports, which means they'd have to buy lots of dongles to attach their older hard drives, external monitors, cameras and the like. Unlike the older MacBook Pro models, the new ones won't have an SD card slot, so users will have to have another dongle to upload photos and videos saved to one. The take of Michael Tsai, a Mac developer, was typical of Apple's core fans. "I was really disappointed with today's Apple event," wrote Tsai on his blog. "It seems like Apple has either lost its way, that it has lost touch with what (some of) its customers want, or that it simply doesn't care about those customers." And, let's be clear, this backlash was against a product that Apple had actually revamped and had, based on its recent standards, been updating regularly. Other products — and their fans — haven't been so lucky. It would be one thing if the rest of the market were standing still or if Apple's products were so far beyond the competition that the company could afford to stand pat or if the company's sales were continuing to grow gangbusters despite its neglect. But none of those things is true. And that's not to mention all the new markets, from smart home products to virtual and augmented reality that Apple is basically ignoring. But, hey, that Touch Bar sure looks neat. I just hope Apple executives aren't shocked when it doesn't spark a rebound for the company.

File/AP  Beware, iPhone users: Fake retail apps surge before holidays By Vindu Goel New York Times News Service Nov 13, 2016 (…) Buy Now Apple said it takes customers' security "very seriously” but weeding out fakes in its online App Store has been a difficult. SAN FRANCISCO — Hundreds of fake retail and product apps have popped up in Apple’s App Store in recent weeks — just in time to deceive holiday shoppers. The counterfeiters have masqueraded as retail chains like Dollar Tree and Foot Locker, big department stores like Dillard’s and Nordstrom, online product bazaars like Zappos.com and Polyvore, and luxury-goods makers like Jimmy Choo, Christian Dior and Salvatore Ferragamo. “We’re seeing a barrage of fake apps,” said Chris Mason, chief executive of Branding Brand, a Pittsburgh company that helps retailers build and maintain apps. He said his company constantly tracks new shopping apps, and this was the first time it had seen so many counterfeit iPhone apps emerge in a short period of time. Some of them appeared to be relatively harmless — essentially junk apps that served up annoying pop-up ads, he said. But there are serious risks to using a fake app. Entering credit card information opens a customer to potential financial fraud. Some fake apps contain malware that can steal personal information or even lock the phone until the user pays a ransom. And some fakes encourage users to log in using their Facebook credentials, potentially exposing sensitive personal information. The rogue apps, most of which came from developers in China, slipped through Apple’s process for reviewing every app before it is published. That scrutiny, which Apple markets as an advantage over Google’s less restrictive Android smartphone platform, is supposed to stop any software that is deceitful, that improperly uses another company’s intellectual property or that poses harm to consumers. In practice, however, Apple focuses more on blocking malicious software and does not routinely examine the thousands of apps submitted to the iTunes store every day to see if they are legitimately associated with the brand names listed on them. Faking it With apps becoming more popular as a way to shop, it is up to brands and developers themselves to watch for fakes and report them, much as they scan for fake websites, said Ben Reubenstein, chief executive of Possible Mobile, a Denver company that makes apps for JetBlue Airways, the PGA Tour and Pokemon Co., among others. “It’s important that brands monitor how their name is being used,” he said. Apple removed hundreds of fake apps Nov. 3 after The New York Times inquired about the specific app vendors that created many of them. Other apps were removed after a New York Post article drew attention to some of the counterfeits earlier this month. “We strive to offer customers the best experience possible, and we take their security very seriously,” said an Apple spokesman, Tom Neumayr. “We’ve set up ways for customers and developers to flag fraudulent or suspicious apps, which we promptly investigate to ensure the App Store is safe and secure. We’ve removed these offending apps and will continue to be vigilant about looking for apps that might put our users at risk.” In September, Apple also embarked on a campaign to review all 2 million apps in the App Store and remove “apps that no longer function as intended, don’t follow current review guidelines or are outdated.” The company says that a significant number of apps have been removed and that the review is continuing. Despite Apple’s efforts, new fake apps appear every day. In some cases, developers change the content of an app after it has been approved by Apple’s monitors. In other instances, the counterfeiters change their names and credentials, and resubmit similar apps after one round of fakes is discovered. “It’s a game of whack-a-mole,” Mason of Branding Brand said. China is by far the biggest source of fake apps, according to security experts. Many of the fake retail apps have red flags signaling that they are not real, such as nonsensical menus written in butchered English, no reviews and no history of previous versions. In one fake New Balance app, for example, the tab for phone support did not list a phone number and said, “Our angents are available over the hone Monday-Firday." Data from Apptopia show that some of the fake apps have been downloaded thousands of times, although it is unclear how many people have actually used them. Reviews posted on some of the apps indicated that at least some people tried them and became frustrated. “Would give zero stars if possible,” wrote one reviewer of the fake Dollar Tree app. “Constantly gets stuck in menus and closes what you were doing and makes you start over.” Most exposed Mason says consumers want to shop online and they search for apps from their favorite stores and brands. “The retailers who are most exposed are the ones with no app at all,” he said. Dollar Tree and Dillard’s, for example, have no official iPhone apps, which made it easier to lure their customers to the fake apps. But the counterfeiters have also mimicked companies that do have an official presence in the App Store, hoping to capitalize on consumer confusion about which ones are real. The shoe retailer Foot Locker Inc., for example, has three iPhone apps. But that did not stop an entity calling itself Footlocke Sports Co. Ltd. from offering 16 shoe and clothing apps in the App Store — including one purporting to be from a Foot Locker rival, Famous Footwear. Similarly, the supermarket chain Kroger Co. has 20 iPhone apps, reflecting the various retail chains in its empire. An entity calling itself The Kroger Inc. had 19 apps, purporting to sell things as diverse as an $80 pair of Asics sneakers and a $688 bottle of Dior perfume. Some of the fake apps have even used Apple’s new paid search ads to propel them to the top of the results screen when customers search for specific brands in the App Store. Jon Clay, director of global threat communications for Trend Micro, an internet security firm, said Apple’s tight control over the iPhone had historically kept malicious apps out of its App Store. Fake apps appeared more often on Google’s Android platform or on third-party app stores, he said. But that is beginning to change. Shortly after the Pokemon Go game was released in the United States in July, for example, a spate of fake iPhone apps related to the game appeared, especially in countries where the game was not yet available. “The criminals are going to take advantage of whatever is hot,” Clay said.

News Offers & Deals Apple Refurbished Deals Include MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, iPad Air 2 And More By Pranav Rastogi - November 13, 2016 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter tweet Apple MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, iPad Air 2 and iPhone 7 all have one thing in common. Apple is bringing forth some sweet deals ahead of Black Friday trying to convince people to buy as many of these devices as possible because it’s a full blown out shopping season and this is excellent for OEMs. Most of these deals ahead of Black Friday are refurbished devices, but they’re still great if you want something cheap. A lot of people don’t care about these sort of deals mainly because they involve refurbished devices. We’ve got a MacBook Pro deal coming straight from Apple, and the tech company is offering it for merely $1,099 each from the original price of $1,299. The MacBook Air is another problem which goes for $929 from the original $999, so it’s another significant deal. Keep in mind that although they’re refurbished this doesn’t mean much because they’re not damaged in any way, they usually might have a few scratches, but they work amazingly well. Apple Pre-Black Friday Deals Before Black Friday 2016 Apple has more good deals in store for you. They’ve got the iPad Air 2 going for $319/$379/$419 from the original prices of $429/$489/$529; this is the 16 GB/ 64 GB and 128 GB versions of the Wi-Fi and Cellular versions of the tablet. Now last but not least we have the iPhone 7 which is getting a substantial reduction as well. Refurbished iPhone 7 devices go for around $529 and $589 depending on storage option which is great. Check out all these deals if you have an Apple device in mind because it’s worth it.

However, regardless of the controversy, it turns out that the number orders that have come in for the new Pro is greater than any other Macbook Pro in Apple’s history, according to Phil Schiller, Apple’s Senior VP of Worldwide Marketing. The product has outsold all of its Windows-based competitors already as well. Slice Intelligence created a graph to demonstrate where the sales stand as of Oct. 31, though the information was pulled from sales numbers – specifically by reviewing “hundreds of millions” of e-receipts – and not exact units sold, so there is a possibility that the numbers are more skewed towards Apple. The graph demonstrates that the sales of the Pro that came in the first five days surpassed sales for key competitor notebooks, including the Microsoft Surface Book and Lenovo Yoga 900. Just another step towards world domination, Apple. We see you.  SHARE TWEET EMAIL Torie Richardson EDMTunes Editor. San Francisco.

Push the home button twice and move over to the right. You will notice a brightness indicator that allows you to change things up. The iPad’s default setting shows two lines of every email prior to it being opened. You can change this to see more if you so desire. In mail under settings, you can make this alteration. Next tap on Contacts, then Calendar, and then change the options. Bookmarks Bar Does tapping the bookmark menu take too much time? Within the iPad you can, simply by enabling the bookmarks bar. Go to your Settings, tap on Safari and turn on the bookmark bar. Did you lose your device? If you use the Apple product iCloud, you will be able to locate your iPad or your iPhone.

You can look at the Apple site, or you can just search on the internet for ways that you may be able to use other Apple devices. Purchased Apps If you have some recently purchased apps from the app store you want to hide, it’s quite easy! Open up the App Store and click on the ‘purchased’ tab on the bottom of your screen. It should give you a list of apps and choose the one you wish to hide. Swipe over the app or right over it, and it should now gray out over the ‘installed’ button. A red button will pop up and you will now have the option to hide the app. There is an iTunes store on your device, and there is actually quite a bit to it. Within the store, you can locate a subsection known as iTunes U which caters to university students. It contains podcasts that focus on a variety of professional topics and is perfect for the ride home. If iPad is for You? If you aren’t sure if an iPad is for you(it is)then you should ask to borrow one from a friend. After playing with it for an hour or two, then you will have a much better idea of exactly what it is capable of and what it can do for your life.

Wccftech News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Report New 10.9-inch Bezel-less iPad Launching in March Alongside Two Other Models By Uzair Ghani Posted 2 days ago 24Shares Share Tweet Submit According to a research note, Apple is set to release three new iPad models in March 2017, including one with a 10.9-inch bezel-less display. Apple Looks Set to Expand its iPad Lineup With New 10.9-inch Tablet – iPad mini Won’t Probably Get an Upgrade Apple did not update its iPad lineup this year, probably because it believes the current offering is more than adequate for a slightly longer run. However, according to a research note from Barclays Research analysts ‘Blayne Curtis, Christopher Hemmelgarn, Thomas O’Malley, and Jerry Zhang’ Apple is set to upgrade its tablet lineup in March of 2017. The analysts cite supply chain sources for their prediction. According to the analysts, Apple will be introducing a new iPad model with a 10.9-inch display, which will carry the same dimensions of current 9.7-inch iPad Pro. Interestingly, this means the device won’t feature any sort of bezel around the display, while at the same time, signaling towards the fact that the Home button is on its way out as well. So a larger display on an already small body? It sounds too good to be true right now. The 12.9-inch iPad Pro is set to receive big upgrades, such as an improved 12-megapixel camera from its little 9.7-inch sibling as well as a True Tone display. Furthermore, it’s believed that the 9.7-inch iPad Pro will carry a lower price tag and will sell alongside the iPad mini 4. Speaking of which, the smallest tablet from Apple won’t be receiving any upgrade this year. So for those who who were anxious to get an upgrade might want to follow this piece of news more carefully. Pangu Jailbreak For iOS 9.3.3 Fixed To Support iPad Pro And iPod Touch 6G Lastly, it’s believed that the new iPads will feature four microphones and will retain the headphone jack. This is a rather strange move given how Apple slashed the audio port from its smartphone lineup but is planning to keep it in its notebook, and now, it’s tablet lineup. There is a possibility the headphone jack part might not be entirely accurate. But we will know for sure as we move closer to the tentative release date of new iPad tablets. Advertisement We will keep our readers updated regarding this news. After all, the very thought of a 10.9-inch bezel-less iPad gives us clues to where Apple might be taking its mobile devices. Furthermore, there is a possibility the Home button will make a complete exit from the lineup, given today’s report is indeed true. Take things with a pinch of salt, please.

Post an ad After Trump win, Silicon Valley reassesses security By: craig timberg and elizabeth dwoskin The Washington Post November 14, 2016 0 Caption + President-elect Donald Trump pumps his fist during an election night rally, Wednesday, Nov. 9, 2016, in New York. (AP Photo/ Evan Vucci) The election of Republican Donald Trump has stunned Silicon Valley, sparking renewed fears about how the federal government's powerful surveillance machinery could undermine personal privacy - especially in the hands of a man with a history of threatening retaliation against those who challenge him. Yet as some prepare to take new high-tech defensive measures against government intrusion, there also is a note of regret: The campaign of Trump's rival, Democrat Hillary Clinton, suffered a series of disruptions when poorly protected emails fell into the hands of Russian hackers, WikiLeaks and, finally, the FBI. Better digital security, including measures long advocated by some experts, might have prevented Clinton's defeat, they say. These twin forces - fear and regret - are fueling demands for the tech industry to push a new wave of security and privacy upgrades that would build on those adopted by the tech industry in the aftermath of the revelations by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden in 2013. Such measures could impede criminal hackers and foreign intelligence services but also make it more difficult for law enforcement officials to discover and collect evidence in authorized investigations. "Everyone is asking about the role of the surveillance state in a Trump presidency," said Peter Eckersley, technology projects director for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a San Francisco-based civil liberties group. "People are very worried and urgently trying to figure out what they can do." In Silicon Valley, many were dazed after Tuesday's election. Some companies let their employees take the day off or wrote all-staff letters reminding their colleagues of their commitment to inclusive workplaces that protect women, immigrants and minorities. Techies, meanwhile, warned one another on Twitter to begin using privacy and encrypted tools. "If you want to oppose Trump, use Tor browser, get home VPN, start using the Signal app, 2FA on phone," one tweet said. "My Twitter timeline is off the hook," said Larry Gadea, founder and chief executive of the start-up Envoy, which enables businesses to register visitors using iPads. "People are saying to use bitcoin and encrypted messages, etc." Officials from tech giants such as Google, Apple and Facebook said they were watching closely for clues to Trump's technology policies. During the campaign, Trump vowed to "penetrate the internet" to prevent ISIS from using it to recruit fighters and chastised Apple for refusing to create a backdoor that would let the FBI unlock an iPhone used by the attackers in the San Bernardino shootings. Lobbyists for internet companies, including Amazon, Uber and Airbnb, arranged a meeting among themselves for next week and scrambled to publish a position paper on subjects ranging from immigration to cybersecurity. Officials at the companies said it was difficult to know how Trump would act because his campaign had barely communicated with the tech sector. Tech companies have raced to protect consumer data from government intrusion since the Snowden revelations. Apple, Google, Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft and Yahoo have all made significant investments in encryption to address customer concerns about privacy invasions. A secure messaging app called Signal was the top trending item in Apple's App Store on Thursday. "A lot of people have been seeing the writing on the wall," said Moxie Marlinspike, founder of Open Whisper Systems, which developed Signal. "It's immensely clear that things have not generally been in great shape in terms of private communications. . That's something that everybody is concerned about." Yet some efforts have lagged - with unsettling consequences. The hacking of nude celebrity photos in August 2014 revealed weaknesses in Apple's iCloud service for backing up data. The hack of Sony Pictures a few months later revealed vulnerabilities in server security. And the breach of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta's Gmail account in March 2016 provided the raw material for months of embarrassing disclosures exploited by Trump. Experts say the Podesta hack might have been prevented by a security feature called "two-factor authentication," which Google has long made available to its users but has not required. "Two-factor authentication" requires users to have both a password and a "second factor" - often a numeric code delivered by a text or authentication app - to access their accounts. The most advanced hackers still might have found a way to access Podesta's accounts, but it would have been far more difficult, experts say. "The people at the top are just as bad at computer security as regular Americans," said Christoper Soghoian, chief technologist for the ACLU. "They are sitting ducks for the most basic of attacks." In a live-stream video appearance Thursday, Snowden also urged internet users to adopt two-factor authentication. Though some hacks appear to be the work of foreign intelligence services - U.S. officials blamed the Sony hack on North Korea, the Podesta hack on Russia - the election of Trump has revived fear of the U.S. government itself. In the closing days of the campaign, the FBI unexpectedly and publicly reopened its investigation of Clinton's use of a private email server after finding thousands of emails on a computer used by an aide, Huma Abedin. That discovery, which came during an unrelated probe into her estranged husband, might never have been made, experts say, if Abedin had used a security measure called "end-to-end encryption" that makes it more difficult for anybody other than the intended recipient to access messages or even their routing information. There is even more concern about the reach of the NSA, whose sprawling surveillance apparatus sparked a worldwide backlash after Snowden shared troves of information with The Washington Post and other news organizations. Even some people who defended the NSA under President Barack Obama have expressed concern about how it might be used by Trump. "I have full faith that the appropriate balance of power and constraint exist when people play by the rules. It's not clear yet that a President Trump would," said former NSA lawyer Susan Hennessey, now a fellow at the Brookings Institution. "There's certainly potential for huge abuse of the national security apparatus, both at the NSA and across the intelligence community."

(Photo by Tomohiro Ohsumi/Getty Images) Apple is anticipated to launch three new iPad Pro lineup next year. A research note obtained by way of MacRumour recommended that the tech massive is planning to revamp the 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch tablets, and is additionally working on a new 10.9-inch model that has an edge-to-edge design. The bezel-free 10-inch model is additionally forsaking the physical domestic button and is predicted to be same in size to the 9.7-inch with the smaller of bezels compensating for the larger screen. This isn't the first time we've heard the news that Apple was expanding an iPad in the 10-inch size range, however, we haven't really heard what the exact screen size would be until now.On top of the new bezel-less iPad, analysts also expect Apple to release a new 9.7-inch cheaper iPad Pro, which will be sold alongside the iPad Mini. Analysts don't expect the iPad Mini to get an update - instead, Apple will continue selling the iPad Mini 4, which was released by Apple in September 2015. 2017 iPad Pro: Designs And Features It's also said that the 12.9-inch iPad Pro will receive its own update. Some expect the device to get a True Tone display, like the smaller 9.7-inch device. That display uses a series of medium light sensors to change the color of the display depending on the color and intensity of the light that is surrounding the iPad, promising that it always appears to look natural. The 12.9-inch iPad Pro will also apparently get the 12MP rear-facing camera from the 9.7-inch device.Next year's iPhone 8 is broadly anticipated to function a bezel-less curved show that will have a digital force contact Home button and Touch ID fingerprint scanner embedded at once into the display, which would possibly make its debut on the upcoming 10.9-inch iPad Pro. 2017 iPad Pro: Release Date And Price All three of the new iPad models will reportedly get quad microphones and will keep the headphone jack, unlike the new iPhone 7. The 2017 iPad Pro models may also come with an updated version of Apple Pencil, which would be cheaper compared to the first-generation model, while the Apple Pencil 2 would be more well-tuned and will have additional features. As always, we'll keep you posted on any new iPad Pro details.

More than just technology news Home Tech Reviews Science Games Culture Video Stay Connected Facebook Twitter RSS Updated Hot Tags Pokemon Go Apple Pokemon Go Update Science Donald Trump Apple Might Release Three New iPads For March: One Of These Is Its Biggest Ever Luis Fran First Posted: Nov 13, 2016 06:34 PM EST Could Apple succeed in its mission of making this product attractive to the public, in a time where desktops and laptops are way more popular? Apple suffered a decrease on its iPad sales this year. (Youtube/ZONEofTECH) A Barclays Research report revealed that hi-tech giant Apple could release three new models of the iPad Pro in March next year, including one that would be the biggest tablet of all time. The variants would be a refreshed model of the 9.7-inch, a brand new 10.9-inch version which would come with a bezel-free design that ditches the home button - being physically the same size as the current generation 9.7-inch iPad Pro- and the 12.9-inch screen size, which represent the largest-sized screen so far. Three New iPads That Could Be Apple´s Surprising Product In 2017 According to the International Business Times, this could mean an incredible revolution for Apple´s tablets, considering that the iPads are currently being retailed in the iPad Mini, which its 7.9-inch screen, the classic iPad, with the 9.7-inch screen and the iPad Pro, which sports 12.9-inch screen. Although this hasn't been confirmed, many believe that this is likely to happen, considering that Apple is betting a lot for renewing interest in its tablets line next year. In fact, this is something that the Cupertino company has been planning, considering that it sold 10.9 millions of these devices two years ago, and now it has sold almost a million less, which clearly shows that the iPad is facing a delicate moment that has to be solved with an important move of this kind. Users Could Watch Videos And Hear Music Better Than Ever According to Express, although the Barclays Research report doesn't show any information regarding the prices, it explains that these iPads might come with a major upgrade in sound quality, as the three new models will now be equipped with quad microphones. This represents great news for iPad lovers, considering that one of its main weakness has now been solved, and now the users have the chance of watching a video or hearing music without the necessity of wearing the 3.5mm headphone jacks, which are also included in the three new iPads. With iPhone and MacBook Pro updates out of the way, Apple will focus its attention on these three new iPads, wanting to make it as popular as its incredible smartphone, which or course, it will not be an easy task, considering that desktops and laptops are nowadays more popular than tablets.   You May Like These Engaging with Capitalism: Cases from Oceania: 33 (Research in Economic Anthropology) More offers Shop Now Groove Is in the Heart (Barclay & Cream Club Mix) $0.99 More offers Shop Now Daily Study Bible Series: Old Testament (William Barclay) CD More offers Shop Now Residential Child Care: Prospects and Challenges (Research Highlights in Social Work) More offers Shop Now How to do library research in art More offers Shop Now Related Articles iPhone Rumors: iPhone 8 Wireless Charging Could Be Way More Advanced Than Current Standard Could Apple Replace Samsung As The Biggest Smartphone Maker In The World Next Year?

According to KnowYourMobile, it is significant to note that Apple will be celebrating the 10th anniversary of the iPhone in 2017. Reportedly, it is likely that since the next-gen flagship will feature major improvements and redesign over the previous iPhone lineups. It is also likely that the company will rebrand it as the iPhone X, instead of the expected iPhone 8 moniker. While Apple has yet to confirm it, jumping over versions for flagships is not new. Just this year, Apple's fiercest rival, South Korea-based Samsung, has launched the Galaxy Note 7. The new flagship has offered major improvements that the tech maker jumped over a sixth version from the previous-generation Galaxy Note 5. It is also said that Apple will radically shift its lineup releases starting next year, foregoing the SE and S versions of the iPhone lineup, and a rebrand to the iPhone X will achieve this. Meanwhile, based on the supposed leaks of the specs and features of the 2017 iPhone, it can be said that a major overhaul is underway. One of the purported improvements is on the design and form factor of the lineup. The iPhone X is said to be an all-glass construction, with the hardware sandwiched in between. In addition, it may well be a truly closed-off device. Aside from ditching the 3.5mm audio jack, the 2017 iPhone is likely to include wireless charging. Speculations also point out that with the emergence of concept phones, Apple will also incorporate surprising features to the next iPhone. Supposedly, the 2017 iPhone will switch over to OLED displays, and its flexibility will allow Apple to integrate a near bezel-less screen for the iPhone. Ditching the home button, the front panel will be occupied by a larger screen area, with the Touch ID baked on the screen glass itself. Meanwhile, it is already expected that the 2017 iPhone will be featuring Apple's next-gen components under the hood, like a new A11 chipset as well as at least 4 GB of RAM.

PC-Tablet Videos Tech Apps Telecom Science Business Social Auto Reviews How-To’s Featured Sony Xperia XZ vs iPhone 7 Plus: Specs, features and price comparison By Amit Rahi - 13/11/2016 Sony is working hard to make a comeback in the smartphone market, and Sony does create some of the masterpieces which you can consider over most of the flagship smartphones but can this flagship smartphone Xperia XZ from Sony take on Apple iPhone 7 Plus in terms of camera, performance, and other features? Let’s check out. Sony Xperia XZ vs iPhone 7 Plus: Display Sony Xperia XZ comes with 5.2 inches IPS LCD with full HD resolution and 424 ppi pixel density. Apple iPhone 7 Plus comes with 5.5 inches full HD IPS display with 401 ppi pixel density. Now comes the display technology, Sony uses TRILUMINOUS display on Xperia XZ and Apple uses Retina display on iPhone 7, which the company claims is the finest. Sony Xperia XZ vs iPhone 7 Plus: Camera Sony Xperia XZ features a 23MP camera with triple image sensing technology. Apple too played with numbers, not in the megapixels but in the camera sensor itself. Apple added two 12 MP cameras on iPhone 7 Plus. Sony crams the best camera sensor it manufactures, Exmor RS with a laser auto focus sensor and RGBC-IR sensor, but what Apple did is added two cameras with different types of lenses. The second top specification in a camera is the aperture. Sony Xperia XZ’s 23 MP camera has f/2.0 aperture whereas Apple iPhone 7 Plus’ dual 12 MP camera has f/1.8 aperture size. So, if you want decent quality pictures in low light conditions then iPhone 7 Plus can serve you better and provide you gorgeous pictures even in low light conditions. The aperture size in Sony Xperia XZ’s front camera is bigger than the iPhone 7 Plus but why you want to take selfies in low light? The star feature of both smartphone camera: Apple iPhone 7 Plus – 2X optical zoom which goes up to 10X using digital zoom, optical image stabilisation and Quad LED true tone flash. 4K video recording at 30 fps and 720p slo-mo video at 240 fps. Sony Xperia XZ – Laser autofocus, EIS (Electronic Image Stabilization) uses a gyro, RGBC-IR sensor for better white balance. 4K video recording at 30 fps. Sony Xperia XZ vs iPhone 7 Plus: Performance The iPhone 7 Plus’ performance in unbeatable and Sony Xperia XZ stand no chance of competing with its Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 chip and 3 GB RAM. Apple iPhone 7 Plus drives the new Apple A10 Fusion chip with 64-bit architecture embedded with an M10 motion coprocessor which processes the pictures directly from the camera. Sony Xperia XZ vs iPhone 7 Plus: Operating System Apple’s iOS 10 is the snappiest operating system created by Apple. It comes with the simplest user interface and taking control of your phone is the easiest thing you can do on an iPhone. No fancy buttons or dedicated keys running around the edges. Sony Xperia XZ comes with Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box. Conclusion The camera is the best feature in both of the smartphones, so if you ask me to pick a smartphone in terms of camera, then iPhone 7 Plus is the best. But what I don’t like about the iPhone is that it’s not customisable. Do tell me what you think about both of the smartphones and which one would you go for.

May Be Using This New Tech in iPhone 8 Even as the iDevice maker is expected to start using OLED technology in some smartphones, this Apple supplier is working on extensions to current liquid crystal displays to make them more competitive. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 13, 2016 at 6:00PM Next year, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is expected to release three iPhone models, according to Nikkei. Two of them will reportedly include 4.7-inch and 5.0-inch liquid crystal displays, while a third so-called "premium" option will use a curved OLED display. Image source: Apple.  Interestingly, in The New York Times' review of this year's iPhone 7, the site said the next-generation iPhone will "have a full-screen face with the virtual button built directly into the screen," citing sources within Apple. I believe that to enable this form factor in the models incorporating liquid crystal displays, Apple may use a new technology that longtime iPhone display supplier Japan Display called a "full active" liquid crystal display, or LCD. What's a full-active LCD? According to Japan Display, a full-active LCD uses a "new high-density wiring layout and new processing and module assembly technologies" to "reduce the bottom bezel [of a smartphone] to be as narrow as the other three sides." "This newly designed LCD module structure will allow the size of a smartphone device to be nearly the same as the display size," a press release from Japan Display reads. Japan Display also said it "aims to start mass production of this display by the end of March, 2017." This suggests that the technology should be ready in time to support next-generation iPhone launches. Sounds like a perfect fit for the new iPhone models The technology described here looks as though it should be able to enable Apple to build the "full-screen face" smartphone that The New York Times described. Additionally, Japan Display laid out a road map during its most recent earnings call showing how it expects this full active LCD technology to evolve. In 2018, the company expects this technology to deliver "low power" consumption. Then, in 2019, the company expects this technology to be "flexible," which should allow for curved displays such as what OLED displays allow for today. This table from Japan Display shows a table pitching the advantages of Japan Display's yet-to-be-released third-generation full active LCDs against OLED technology: Image source: Japan Display. Note, though, that Japan Display's moneymaker is LCDs. It's still working to develop OLED tech for mobile devices. In any event, Japan Display claims advantages in power efficiency, brightness viewing angles, lifetime, cost, and "designability." It'll be interesting to see how these seemingly bold claims hold up when production displays make their way into customers' hands. The iPhone may continue to use LCDs for quite some time Although next year's premium iPhone model is expected to get a curved OLED display, I wonder if Apple's game plan is to continue to use LCDs in lower-end iPhone models over the next several years, rather than switch everything to OLED for cost reasons. Should Japan Display, and other LCD makers, continue to advance LCDs to make them competitive with OLEDs in the areas that matter, then the technology may have a fairly long-term future in smartphones and tablets. Nevertheless, it's also important to understand that OLED technology won't stand still, either. OLED technology has made significant strides over the past several years, and it's very likely that it will increasingly be the display technology of choice for very high-end smartphones and other mobile devices. Unsurprisingly, Japan Display says it will continue to pour money into the research and development of OLED technology, even as it builds better LCDs over time.  Ashraf Eassa has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Post an ad Tech review: Google's entry into smartphone design has some very cool features By: jim rossman Tribune News Service November 14, 2016 0 Caption + Caseology Introduces Stylish Cases for Google Pixel and Pixel XL (PRNewsFoto/Caseology) I always thought Google was missing out on a great opportunity in not having its own phone to take advantage of its Android operating system. Apple learned early on that controlling entire hardware and software systems was the way to go, but Google seemed content to just work on the software end. Sure, there were a few forgettable Google-branded Nexus phones, but they were far from the best Android handsets. Now Google has decided to dive in head-first and design its own phones, the Google Pixel and Pixel XL. HTC is building the phones, but the design is all Google's. Let's get one thing out of the way first - Google's Pixel looks like an iPhone. That's not necessarily a bad thing. Apple has sold millions of iPhones, and the design and look are proven hits. But even though it looks like an iPhone and costs the same as the iPhone (starting at $650), there are hardware differences that are worth mentioning. Hardware and specs I've been using the non-XL Pixel for the last few weeks, so my hands-on thoughts will focus on the smaller version. The Pixel is built around a 5-inch AMOLED screen made from Corning Gorilla Glass 4 with a resolution of 1920 by 1080 pixels (441 pixels per inch). It runs a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 quad-core processor with four gigabytes of RAM and ships with 32 gigabytes or 128 gigabytes of storage. The sleep-wake button is high on the right edge, but the volume rocker button is also on the right. This put all the buttons comfortably under your thumb (if you're right-handed). The big difference in the Pixel's design is the placement of the fingerprint sensor on the phone's back, which happens to be exactly where my index finger rests when I'm holding the phone. Putting the fingerprint reader on the back isn't really better or worse than the iPhone's front placement - it's a matter of taste. Because the Pixel chose the back, I have to pick up the phone to unlock it with my finger. I do find I keep my iPhone lying on my desk, so I am able to just touch my finger to the reader without picking up the phone to check a message or text. The body is made of aluminum, but the top third of the phone's backside is also glass. The main camera has a 12-megapixel sensor and an f/2.0 lens. The front camera has an 8-megapixel sensor with an f/2.4 lens. The camera is top-notch. The Pixel is on par with Apple's iPhone 7 or Samsung's Galaxy S7 Edge. I can't say enough nice things about the camera on the Pixel. I also love invoking the camera app by a quick double flip of the phone or double tapping the sleep-wake button. Google also includes unlimited cloud storage for all photos and videos taken with the Pixel. The charger is USB-C, which seems to be where the world is headed (except for iPhones). The Pixel's USB-C port uses the faster USB 3.0, which means much faster transfers. According to Google, 15 minutes of USB-C charging from the included 18-watt power supply will provide seven hours of power. The Pixel's physical dimensions are 5.6 inches by 2.7 inches by 0.2 inches, and it weighs 5.04 ounces. It's about a quarter of an inch longer than my iPhone 6s. The 2,770 ampere-hour battery easily lasted a day for my use. You'll find the usual radios - 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.2 along with near field communication. There are a few features you won't find on the Pixel, including water resistance and stereo speakers (there's just one). There is no slot for adding storage, and the Pixel does not have wireless charging. Android in all its glory You may have used Android phones before, but you really haven't used Android as Google intended. Different wireless carriers and phone manufacturers put their own software on top of Android, often cluttering up the landscape. The Pixel runs pure, unadulterated Android 7.1, and it's the only phone to feature Google's new Assistant. Simply say "OK, Google," and you'll invoke the Google Assistant, which will answer questions, manage tasks, find photos, entertain you and help you stay on schedule. I think Google's Assistant is much better than Apple's Siri. You can have an actual conversation with Assistant. I asked the Assistant how to get to a local park, and the directions from my location were displayed on a Google map. Then I asked, "When was it built?" and the Assistant brought up an article about the park and when it was built. Very cool. There are some other Android tweaks you'll notice. I had to look up the way you call up the app list on the Pixel. With other Android phones, you'll have an icon to bring up all the apps. On the Pixel, you swipe up from the bottom of the screen to bring up the apps. The apps are also pretty uniform in their appearance. All the included app icons are round. Third-party apps still can be shaped differently, but I like the round look. Overall the phone was very snappy and responsive. Conclusions I'm really happy Google has decided to get into the phone game. The company has the most popular operating system, and it's about time it designed its own hardware to take advantage of it. I'm a longtime iPhone user, so I'm a sucker for the design. I'm still on the fence about the fingerprint sensor placement. There is a lot to like about the Pixel and Pixel XL. I realize this isn't an in-depth review, but there are plenty of places online to find those. The Pixel is a hit with me, and it joins the iPhone and Samsung Galaxy 7 phones in the top tier of handsets. I can't wait to see what Google does with the next version of the Pixel. The Pixel costs $649 and the XL costs $769 for the 32gb model. Add $100 to each to increase the storage to 128gb. They are available from Google, Verizon stores or Best Buy. You might see commercials or websites that say the Pixel is a Verizon exclusive, but that's just for sales. If you buy the Pixel through Google, it's unlocked for use on any carrier. - Jim Rossman writes for The Dallas Morning News; email him at jrossman@dallasnews.com.

The high-end device has featured some cutting-edge specs. Rumors say that the next-gen iPhone will feature a curved screen as it coincides with the phone's 10th-year anniversary. Many companies like Samsung, Huawei and Xiaomi came with the concept of curved screens in their devices. It seems strange to think that Apple will ever try to copy Samsung - its key rival, but apparently, it seems to be happening now. Samsung was the first player in the curved design screen; the South Korean corporation had launched its flagship Galaxy S6 with edge-to-edge curved display. The current Apple flagships have 4.7-inches and 5.5-inches displays. If rumors are to be believed, the next versions of the iPhone might feature 5 and 5.8-inch displays for iPhone 8, with the larger version possible sporting an OLED screen. According to Barclays Research Note to MacRumors, the devices will have larger and curved displays. Advertisement It is also being said that screen will feature edge-to-edge without bezels display. The California-based tech giant hasn't increased the screen size since the launch 0f iPhone 6 in 2014. Furthermore, apart from the display, many speculations are floating on social media sites regarding the iPhone's next version. In terms of design, the device could come up with glass and metal build for ots materials without the home button. In place of it, the Touch ID will be featured in the display. According to Macworld, the US tech giant might discontinue the 'S' generation strategy. Samsung has revolutionized the curved display concept with its latest Galaxy S series. This concept might also push other rivals for the curved design. Apple hasn't come with any groundbreaking feature since iPhone 6; introducing a larger curved edge display in next generation flagship could be a game changer for the company.   Advertisement     SEE ALSO Adidas manufactures 'Ultra Boost Uncaged Parley' shoes out of ocean waste Samsung Galaxy S8 AI Digital Assistant plus specs, rumors and price Huawei Porsche design Mate 9, perfect Note 7 alternative vs. Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge Android 7.0 Nougat will soon be available in OnePlus 3, OnePlus 2 and OnePlus X Tagsiphone, iPhone8, AppleiPhone, Apple, CurveedgeiPhone Advertisement Advertisement © 2015 Latin Post.

[VIDEO] SAN FRANCISCO, CA - SEPTEMBER 07: A new Apple iPhone 7 is seen during a launch event on September 7, 2016 in San Francisco, California. Apple Inc. unveiled the latest iterations of its smart phone, the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, the Apple Watch Series 2, as well as AirPods, the tech giant's first wireless headphones. (Photo : Stephen Lam/Getty Images) As the 10th iPhone anniversary celebration is nearing, Apple is reportedly on the final stage of development of its anniversary phone, which is presumed as the iPhone 8. The new smartphone is expected to do away with iPhone's traditional design. See more details here! Apple iPhone 8 Features & Specs The submitted report of Barclays Research Team to Apple's supply chain in Asia has revealed about the Cupertino-based tech giant's plan on releasing a new iPhone in 2017. According to The Apple Post, the report stated about a curved-edge and bezel-free screen display iPhone 8 that is believed to come in two size variants - 5-inch and 5.8-inch model. Furthermore, the iPhone 8 5.8-inch model is said to feature an OLED display technology for brighter and sharper display output. This kind of technology is said to be more energy efficient compared to the previous ones using LCD display. In addition, both 5-inch and 5.8-inch iPhone 8 are also believed to drop the Home Button to further achieved the bezel-less screen display. However, Barclays Research Team is cynic about the removal of the iconic Home Button and embedding it on the screen; however, they expected for the iPhone 8 to be extended horizontally and vertically, Mac Rumors reported. It can be recalled that both KGI Analyst Ming-Chi Kou and trusted website Nikkei have predicted about the upcoming anniversary phone of Apple. Kou predicted about the 5.8-inch curved-edge OLED display iPhone 8 while Nikkei said about 4.7-inch and 5-inch models. Apple iPhone 8 Release Date Apple has not released an official schedule for the celebration of 10th iPhone anniversary event, however, rumors suggesting that it will fall in the month of September having the first iPhone introduced in the same month almost 10 years ago. As Apple is currently negotiating with LG and Samsung as well as Foxconn-owned Sharp for the OLED panel supplies, the presumed iPhone 8 is expected to hit the store shelves according to the Cupertino giant's scheduled release date.      Tags Apple iPhone 8, Apple iPhone 8 Features, apple iPhone 8 rumors, apple iPhone 8 specs, Apple iPhone 8 Price, Apple iPhone 8 Updates, Apple iPhone 8 Release Date © 2016 University Herald, All rights reserved.

Aside from its upcoming 10th iPhone anniversary celebration, the Cupertino giant is also said to release three new iPads with one bezel-free and edge-to-edge display. See more details here! Apple Will Release Three New iPads in 2017 Barclays Research analysts reported that Apple is heading towards releasing three new iPad models in March 2017. The research team which is composed of Jerry Zhang, Thomas O'Malley, Christopher Hemmelgarn and Blayne Curtis has also said that Apple will released a refreshed 9.7-inch model, 12.9-inch version and the 10.9-inch which is believed to have a bezel-less and edge-to-edge screen display, The Apple Post reported.   Furthermore, the following are the features that are heavily expected to land in the three new iPad models: retained the 3.5mm audio jack, 12MP rear camera with iSight feature and True Tone flash and quad microphones an enhancement to the recent dual set-up. Barclays Research team report also cited that the 9.7-inch model will be the low-cost one which is identified as the iPad Pro but no further information has been reported for the prices of the other two models. It can be recalled that KGI Analyst Ming-Chi Kou and the trusted website Mac Otakara have both made a predictions about the 10-inch range iPad Pro that will be released in 2017, according to Mac Rumors. However, the two have different predictions on the screen sizes with Kou for 10.5-inch and Mac Otakara for 10.1-inch. Apple Will Release Revolutionary iPads in 2018 As reported earlier by Ming-Chi Kou, Apple is gearing towards manufacturing of "revolutionary iPads" in 2018 with flexible AMOLED display features and Touch ID fingerprint sensor embedded in the screen. The on-going negotiations of Apple and Sharp for the OLED panels supply is presumed as successful as the former is reported to release an iPhone 8 with AMOLED display in 2017 for its 10th iPhone anniversary celebration.        Tags iPad Pro 2, ipad pro 2017, Apple iPad 2017, iPad 2017 Features, iPad 2017 Specs, ipad pro 2 release date, iPad Pro 2017 Release Date © 2016 University Herald, All rights reserved.

Yes. Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon all suffered this week, but some think that’s short-sighted. by Kara Swisher@karaswisher Nov 13, 2016, 3:46pm EST tweet share Linkedin Is the new U.S. president bad for Silicon Valley’s business? Carsten Koall / Getty Images There’s no question that stock of tech companies got hit this week on no real financial developments or performance issues. Except, of course, the election of Donald J. Trump as president of the United States. Yes, that. Apple shares were down in the five days from $110.03 to about $108.43. Google was down from $795 to $771.56; Facebook dropped from $123.21 to $119.04; Netflix dropped from $124.26 to $114.78; and Amazon was off from $771.60 to $739.01. Most Wall Street analysts pointed to the Trump win as the proximate cause of the drop, given his rocky history with tech and also Silicon Valley so far. That’s included: A call for a boycott of Apple due to its encryption fight with the government and also his contention that it should make its devices in the U.S.; an attack on Amazon over taxes and, really, founder and CEO Jeff Bezos’s ownership of the tough-on-Trump Washington Post; and opposition to net neutrality regulations by the FCC, which have favored the internet powerhouses, and the possibility of their repeal. Add to that a hard line on immigration, as well as potentially isolationist trade policies and a myriad of tangles over tech-favored social issues like gay rights. And, most of all, just a fundamental disconnect between the new administration and Silicon Valley, which largely supported Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Of course there’s Peter Thiel, so Facebook (where he is a director) might be safe, along with Airbnb, Palantir, SoFi and other investments he has made in a myriad of tech startups. But most in Silicon Valley have no direct lines into the Trump administration, aside from tweeting congratulatory pleasantries at it in the vain hope of detente, so it will be a rough road for a while until the expected lobbying compromises are made in D.C. over the next year. And that is precisely what will happen. For all its vaunted liberal ideals of tolerance and meritocracy, tech is big business and it will find a way to live and thrive inside a Trump regime and make all the necessary compromises. There’s some good things they can get, too — all kinds of goodies for the rich, deregulation of the kind that benefits tech around employment, perhaps, and more. And a more business-friendly and free-spending administration, which will largely benefit banking, defense and infrastructure companies initially, will most certainly trickle down to tech in ways that might not seem clear right now. But government aid, obviously, is not the way that tech has thrived for so long. While it has used all the levers, most of Silicon Valley has been successful through creating innovative products and services that consumers and businesses use enthusiastically. Those that have not innovated have gotten dinged and those that have are doing well. That’s why the current stock sell-off is a short-term panic, rather than a real worry. Is it really likely that Trump will target Amazon relentlessly until it is in ruins? It makes for a compelling media story and Trump holds a grudge, but seems unlikely that this is what he wants to spend his time doing as president. As long as the company continues to improve its business in the ways that Wall Street likes, that will be all that matters, and any vindictive attacks on it by Trump will look bad for him and not Amazon. What investors will need to pay attention to is the overall market — it’s the economy, stupid, and as usual — and how issues with other countries like China and Europe develop. While there will be pressure to make more tech goods in this country, it’d be a small price to pay. They may feel bad on social media and wring their hands at the fresh daily horrors, but I predict total normalization by those in tech, who can pretzel with the best of them. And then it’s back to business as usual and the tech stocks will rise and fall based on that. recode_divider In this Storystream Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump: Presidential election 2016 Donald Trump says his tweeting as president will be ‘very restrained,’ even as he trolls the New York Times today Should you ignore the Trump dump of tech stocks?

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Samsung sets their Eyes on a Revolutionary Holographic TV | Main | Chinese State Publication Warns President Elect Trump that any Tariffs on Chinese Goods Would be bad News for Apple » November 13, 2016 Microsoft, Apple and Google Aim to Extend Touch Technologies to a World of new Devices and Applications   This week the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office published a patent application from Microsoft about a new embedded sensor system that will allow touch controls to extend beyond traditional devices like a notebook touchpad through to clothing, in-home appliances, vehicle dashboards and steering wheels, a future Xbox controller, HoloLens and beyond. While Microsoft is working to make this happen in the not too-distant-future, Google is also working on bringing this technology to smart garments, according to a recent patent filing. Apple, on the other hand, has already brought embedded touch controls to their Magic Mouse and new Apple TV remote with Siri and has been working on this since 2007. But with patents from Google and Microsoft now coming to light, it's a sure thing that the race is now on to bring touch controls to a universe of new devices in the coming years. Today's report covers Microsoft's latest patent revelations along with highlights from Apple products and patents to demonstrate that Apple has been ahead of the curve on this front for many years.   Overview   Microsoft notes in their patent filing that designers of devices are continually looking to improve the accuracy and efficiency of touch, gestural, and other input mechanisms supported by devices to make it easier for users to interact with device, and thereby increase the popularity and utility of the devices. Traditionally, sensor systems utilize rigid components, such as printed circuit boards (PCBs), which makes it difficult to shape the sensors and/or include sensors in flexible or irregularly shaped objects and surfaces. Thus, the rigidity of traditional sensor systems limits the ways in which the sensors may be employed and the kinds of devices that can make use of the sensor systems. Microsoft's latest invention is to overcome these shortcomings so as to allow a new generation of devices to include touch and gestural controls. .   Introducing Embroidered Touch Sensor Systems   Microsoft's invention relates to embroidered sensor assemblies. In one or more implementations, the embroidered sensor assembly is formed on a flexible substrate, such as a suitable fabric material. Conductive patterns are sewn or stitched into the flexible substrate using embroidery techniques to form an array of sensors that can be configured in various ways and used in many different applications.   In Microsoft's patent FIG. 1 we're able to see an example of an embroidered sensor assembly. In particular, a sensor assembly #102 is represented as a flexible substrate #104 and an arrangement of embroidered sensors #106 that are embroidered (e.g., stitched or sewn) into the flexible substrate, In this example, the embroidered sensors are depicted as being arranged as a generally rectangular grid or array of conductive wires or threads in rows and columns.   The conductive wires may be configured as thin strands of metal such a copper or using another conductive material. The wires may have a diameter in range of about thirty to one hundred microns. Even larger diameter sizes up to several millimeters (e.g., approximately 2 mm to 5 mm) may also be used depending up the end use scenario. The conductive wires form intersections (e.g., nodes and/or electrodes) that correspond to positions of individual sensing points.   Although a rectangular grid arrangement is depicted, other patterns are also contemplated such as, by way of example and not limitation, hexagonal arrangements, concentric circles, a spiral arrangement, parallel lines, horizontal rows, vertical columns, individual points, and irregular arrangements.   The flexible substrate is representative of a flexible base material that is suitable for embroidering of the embroidered sensors. By way of example and not limitation, the flexible substrate may be configured using various fabric materials. The fabric materials can include woven and non-woven textiles as well as synthetic and natural fabrics. Flexible plastic and polymers substrates are also contemplated.   The sensor assembly can be configured to implement various kinds of sensors and sensing such as proximity, motion, flow direction and rates, gestures, and/or strain, to name a few examples.   Sensors may be arranged to measure mutual capacitance or self-capacitance. The sensor assembly can also implement conductive nodes configured to enable pressure and/or force sensitive controls for an input device, such as a keyboard, trackpad, mouse, etc. Something that Apple has already accomplished and implemented with their Magic Mouse as noted below.   In one of Apple's continuation patents published this week by the U.S. Patent Office Apple notes that a future head mounted display system would utilize a touch sensor on the exterior of the headset that would allow users to control content and audio volume. As with the Magic Mouse, the controls will simply be present on the device to accept gestures or motions to initiate them yet not be seen to clutter the interface of the device.     Possible Applications for Embroidered Sensors   As Microsoft notes in patent FIG. 2 below, their invention could be implemented in a wide range of future products including flexible displays, the HoloLens, Surface devices (tablets, notebooks, desktop), Xbox, a smartphone, a smartwatch, a smartband, a helmet, sporting equipment such as balls, a tennis racquet, a ring, an article of clothing, a glove, protective gear, sports pads, and a bracelet, to name but a few examples.   Another area where embroidered sensors will come to market will support the smart home, our vehicles and beyond. Microsoft notes that an embroidered sensor assembly can be embedded in, attached to, or otherwise associated with various different kinds of smart objects including furniture, appliances, industrial equipment, and other manufactured goods. Examples of smart objects could include devices including pipe and other objects such as lamps, doors, locks, molded plastic devices, products for automobiles or aircraft, a lounge chair, a coffee maker and more.   By way of example and not limitation, the embedding process #602 noted in patent FIG. 6 above, may involve surrounding an arrangement of a sensor assembly with a thermosetting resin and curing the thermosetting resin by applied heat or radiation to form the rigid structure #604. In another example, the embedding process involves arranging the sensor assembly in a mold and then melting a thermoplastic polymer and press molding or injection molding the thermoplastic polymer to surround the sensor assembly and form the rigid structure.   While Apple has never called their invisible sensors for the Magic Mouse 'embroidered sensors' they nonetheless have delivered on such sensors and plan to expand on this as noted with their future headset. Apple may also bring touch sensors to future Apple Watch smartbands (one and two) that could include motion sensors as Microsoft's patent has noted.    In 2014 Patently Apple posted a report titled "Could Apple be Eying Smart Clothing as the Next Big Thing?" Certain Apple patents and specific hires from the fashion world along with their involvement with the Met Museum's 2016 Fashion Exhibit on Fashion in an Age of Technology is teasing us into thinking tht Apple may be thinking of fashion beyond the Apple Watch. Apple could have hired many people to run the Apple Store operations but purposely chose to hire Angela Ahrendts who was CEO of Burberry a high-end fashion company. Beyond money, why would a successful CEO in fashion want anything to do with a restrictive computer company? Is it just coincidence or does Apple have a bigger vision for fashion and technology?   Digging back even further, I was able to find a 2007 Apple patent filing that was published in 2012 covering technology along this same front. Patently Apple's report covering this patent was titled "Apple Wins Next Generation Multi-Touch Skin Technology." The patent forecasted bringing touch sensors to objects like an in-home or in-office globe, vehicle steering wheels and a remote control. Is that not what the new Apple TV remote with Siri offers? Yes, of course and Apple has been working on that for years ahead of Microsoft and others.   Of course Google has now woken up to this next wave of sensors and filed a patent that we covered just last month titled "Google invents a Touch Gesture System Designed Specifically for Future Smart Garments."     In the end, it would appear that Apple is well ahead of the completion on sensors beneath device surfaces, though they've yet to advance into the world of fashion. Microsoft clearly wants to quickly move into this area of technology as noted in this week's patent revelations. They could easily begin by incorporating their embroidered sensor system into future versions of their Xbox controller, HoloLens headset and Surface devices and move into other areas over time.   Whether you call it embroidered sensors or invisible sensors, the fact is that touch sensors are about to go beyond notebook touchpads and touch displays for smartphones and tablets and begin to enter the general device world for in-home devices, in-vehicle applications and eventually smart clothing over the next five years. The good news is that Apple has been way ahead of the curve in this area so it'll be interesting to see where they take this touch technology next.   Microsoft filed their patent application back in Q2 2015 which was published by USPTO this past week. Considering that this is a patent application, the timing of such products to market is unknown at this time.   A Note for Tech Sites covering our Report: We ask tech sites covering our report to kindly limit the use of our graphics to one image.

An action-thriller novel — book 1 in the KESTREL series. ★★★★★ — Amazon My iPad Setup Nov 13th, 2016 tech & ipad-only 4 min read This article is part of a series on going iPad-only. If you’re a maker of iPad apps that my readers would be interested in, you can sponsor this site for a week. Since beginning this series of articles, I’ve often been asked on Twitter what exactly my iPad setup is. Here’s an overview of what I use, and how I work. Without further ado, here’s a photo of my entire office rig. (I don’t actually work hunched over a coffee table, of course, but it made for a prettier picture. I’m 37 years old, and I’m well aware of ergonomics, thank you very much. You may also want to compare and contrast it with my office rig of three years ago.) I have a gold iPad Pro 9.7” (128GB, wi-fi). I also have an Apple Pencil, and I use an Apple Magic Keyboard with the iPad. The 128GB model is more than enough for my needs — I’m a writer, and all my active work takes up barely a tenth of my Dropbox storage. I also don’t need cellular connectivity because I have an iPhone with tethering and a very generous data plan. Regarding size: I much prefer the 9.7” iPad to the 12.9” version; I find the larger one just too big for me. People with different preferences and needs will choose the 12.9” instead, I’m sure, but I prioritise a sense of radical portability. The 9.7” is at a great midway point between a small magazine (in portrait orientation) and a really small laptop (in landscape). Given how focused and touch-centric iOS is, with sparse UI and direct interaction, I’ve yet to miss a larger screen — especially as it’s been a few years since I extensively used anything larger than a 12” MacBook or an 11” MacBook Air. The 9.7” iPad is the right size for me. I’ve heard rumours of a 10.x” model in 2017, and I’ll watch any developments in that area with interest. Regarding getting the iPad Pro instead of the iPad Air 2, which has identical dimensions and weight albeit with more modest tech specs: I was very much attracted to the Pencil as an input device for graphics work (more about that in a future article), scribbling, possibly finding a way to make autographed ebooks, and — admittedly — as a toy. The improved True Tone display, the four speakers, and the iPhone 6s-level front and back cameras were also enticing. I’d budgeted for it, so that’s what I went with. If those aspects aren’t important to you, you can certainly save quite a bit by going for the Air series of iPad instead. Regarding the external keyboard: I also very much like the ability to push the iPad further away from me than a fixed keyboard-case would allow, hence the Bluetooth keyboard. The Magic Keyboard is the finest Apple typing machine of the modern age, in my opinion, and I love the key action on it. The battery also lasts for weeks, or even months. The one sub-optimal aspect of this arrangement is when I occasionally want to use the iPad for typing while I’m sitting in an armchair; a dedicated keyboard case would provide the underside rigidity to make it a more comfortable experience. I either prop the iPad nearby and keep the keyboard on my lap, or use the on-screen keyboard. As I said, it’s for a small percentage of my time. I’ve tried the Smart Keyboard, and while I like its key-travel and the cleverness of the design, I find it a bit too small for my hands (and the UK layout has an absurdly small left Shift key). I also don’t like how the underside of the keyboard — which will be resting on arbitrary surfaces — is the part that goes flush to the screen when the cover is folded up. I am interested, though, in the Logitech Create keyboard case for the iPad Pro, but I haven’t got beyond adding it to my Amazon wishlist. It’s something I plan to try out in future. My current non-keyboard case is a third-party brown leather cover, with a slot for the Pencil, magnetic wake/lock, and the ability to prop the iPad up at a couple of different angles. My wife got me a cute wooden stand for the Pencil too, which you can run a Lightning charge cable through if you want. When it’s all folded up to put in my bag, it’s a very compact arrangement indeed. I leave the stand for the Pencil at home. You can read the other articles in this series to hear about some of the apps I use for various tasks, but I keep my primary Home screen pared-back. A few essential productivity, communication, and social media tools, and plenty of space. Here’s how it looks at the moment. My iPad (and MacBook) wallpaper is just a solid shade of purple, my favourite colour. If you want it, you can download it as an image. I do most of my work from a coffee shop, or on the odd occasion that I work from home, I have a dedicated office here. In the coffee shop, I use the iPad propped up in the case as shown previously, and don’t have a problem with it. As I said, I do keep it pushed back a bit from the keyboard. When I’m at home, I have a clever Lavolta stand, previously used with my MacBook, that elevates the whole iPad (in its case) to eye-level, and also lets me tilt it forward so the screen is nigh-vertical. I also have an Aeron chair, and a Kensington foot rest which — critically — has a lockable tilt control. It’s very comfortable. The whole iPad plus Pencil plus keyboard setup is lighter than my 12” MacBook, less expensive, and feels like it’s several different machines in one. It’s extremely portable and flexible, and dear reader, I’m really loving it. I’m always on the lookout for new and better stands and cases, and I’m certain to mention those on social media as and when I acquire them. You should follow me on Twitter to stay up to date. That’ll do for now. Thanks for reading, and I’ll see you again next time. Twitter Facebook Google+ Email My writing is supported by readers like you.

On September 19, Apple's new products, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, with iOS 8 featuring 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch displays, have become available in the US, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Puerto Rico, Singapore and the UK, and will be available in more than 20 additional countries beginning on September 26. Apple iPhone 8 rumors and leaks are uncontainable, and now the latest smartphone is said to have a larger, curved screen that extends to edges. According to Yahoo News, recent rumors suggest that Apple might borrow a page from Samsung's playbook. On top of this, the new iPhone 8 will come with a larger, curved displays base from the note sent to Barclays Research. Furthermore, Barclays Research analysts believe that Apple will now stitch from the current 4.7-inch iPhone 7 and a 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus to a large 5 to 5.8 -inch displays for the iPhone 8. The iPhone 8 might also sport on OLED screen which will then extend edge-to-edge with virtually no bezels, perhaps a little bit similar to Xiaomi's Mi Mix. Advertisement The research note received by the Barclays Research corroborates that KGI Securities analysts Ming-Chi Kuo's statement in March that the said Apple iPhone 8 will launch a 5.8- inch screen with a curved display and glass casing if possible to be next year, as per Mac Rumors. Also, a Japanese website Nikkei claims that the larger-screened iPhone 8 will be a premium model. Additionally, it has been widely rumored that Apple will release a bezel-free design ant the iconic Home button will be removed on this iPhone 8. However, this rumor about removing the Home button is said to be unbelievable as Barclays Research mentioned. Meanwhile, it does expect that the screen will extend vertically and horizontally as well. Consequently, if this larger, bezel-less, curved screens of the Apple iPhone 8 rumors would end up being true, it would definitely the be the first screen size increase since 2014 during the release of Apple iPhone 6. The Apple iPhone 8 rumor which is said to be in great possibility is the appearance of better cameras, faster processor, and a new OS version. These rumors are just exciting the fans for the new baby of Apple. Advertisement   Advertisement       © 2016 Mstars News, All rights reserved. Do not reproduce without permission.

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     Apple’s MacBook Pro Beats All Other Laptops Of 2016 In Sales Posted: Nov 13 2016, 10:29am CST | by Ahmed Humayun, Updated: Nov 14 2016, 10:29pm CST, in News | Apple     Even after all the criticism on MacBook Pro 2016, it is selling like hot cakes. Apple has recently announced that the MacBook Pro 2016 series has broken the record for online sales for the company. You can just imagine the bar which the laptop has set for others to compete. Apple is just in being so proud and boastful. Don't Miss: Hatchimals in Stock at Walmart An independent survey conducted has confirmed that Apple MacBook Pro 2016 has outsold all other laptops in the market in merely five days of availability. The numbers are absolutely great especially when compared to Windows. The results leave Apple very much positive not only about the current standing of the notebook but also for what lies in the future. Slice Intelligent’s data is pretty much evident is showing that the New MacBook Pro has outsold the Dell XPS 13 and 15 combined. The Mac-OS hardware is very powerful. It has even beaten Microsoft’s Surface Book in competition. The new Pro just does great in comparison with other laptop sales. In only five days of availability the Apple MacBook Pro has almost crossed the complete MacBook sales in 2015 and 2016. However one thing should be made note of here is that Slice’s method of collecting data is not so fool proof. This is because it analyses receipts from 4.4 million shoppers in the United States. The analysis should be wide spread so that the popularity of MacBook could be understood. With all this positive news there is one negative fact too. Many MacBook users are not happy that Apple has not refreshed the MacBook Pro enough. Interestingly 40% of MacBook buyers of 2014 chose to buy a competing brand rather than the MacBook. However no matter how credible the data results are one thing is for sure Tim Cook will most certainly be happy with the initial sale results of the MacBook Pro.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 13, 2016 at 11:06AM In each of the past three Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone product cycles, there's been some sort of controversy around the new devices. Image source: Apple.  The iPhone 6 Plus was controversial because the devices were prone to bending under a significant amount of pressure -- a situation critics referred to as "bend gate." The iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus didn't suffer from bend gate, but it turned out that Apple dual-sourced the manufacturing of the A9 processors inside these phones. One A9 manufacturer built more efficient chips than the other, and thus the "chip gate" controversy ensued. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus didn't suffer from bend gate, nor did they suffer from chip gate, since the A10 Fusion chip is sole-sourced this time around. However, a new controversy has arisen: modem gate. This year, Apple decided to source modems from two vendors -- Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) -- and, unsurprisingly, a third-party report demonstrated that the Qualcomm modem is superior to the Intel modem. Should Apple investors worry about modem gate? I don't think so -- here's why. Does the modem matter to most consumers? It's very unlikely that most smartphone owners are aware of the modem chips that power their smartphones. Buyers might have a general sense of the wireless capabilities of their phones -- LTE support, for example. The savvier smartphone shoppers may know that if they want to have the flexibility to change carriers, they should make sure to buy unlocked phones with support for the CDMA wireless standard some major networks require. However, it's reasonable to assume that most buyers simply don't factor in the performance or features of the modem much, if at all, in making their purchasing decisions. Indeed, I'd be shocked if most consumers even knew that Apple is dual-sourcing the modems for the iPhone 7-series smartphones. Factors such as form factor, camera, operating system, display quality, and storage capacity are probably much more important to the user experience and buying decisions than the modem is -- assuming, of course, that the modem used is good enough. Qualcomm for the modem aficionados For potential iPhone customers who care about getting iPhone models with the superior Qualcomm modems, there's a very easy solution: Buy an unlocked iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus. The unlocked versions of these iPhones necessarily include Qualcomm modems, as the Intel modems don't support CDMA networks and thus wouldn't work on some major carriers. If a customer is knowledgeable enough to know the differences in modem performance of the Qualcomm-based iPhone and the Intel-based one -- something that wasn't explored in most, if not all, of the mainstream reviews of the devices -- then that customer should have no problem identifying and purchasing the "right" model. Much ado about nothing There's no evidence to suggest that bend gate had any significant impact on iPhone 6 and 6 Plus sales, as the iPhone 6-series sold in record numbers. Nor is there any evidence to suggest that chip gate was influential, either, especially since the A9 chip, no matter the manufacturer, was easily the fastest smartphone processor on the market during its lifetime. Modem gate is more of the same. It's fun for the tech press to write about, and for those who are into the technical stuff, it's interesting. But Apple's iPhone sales are primarily to the non-technical masses who simply want excellent devices. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus models with the Qualcomm modems are clearly better, and I would recommend those to individuals looking to buy either phone, but I just can't see any meaningful impact to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus demand based on modem gate. I can't wait to see what next year's "gate" will be.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel and Qualcomm. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple and Qualcomm.

Nor is there any evidence to suggest that chip gate was influential, either, especially since the A9 chip, no matter the manufacturer, was easily the fastest smartphone processor on the market during its lifetime. Modem gate is more of the same. It's fun for the tech press to write about, and for those who are into the technical stuff, it's interesting. But Apple's iPhone sales are primarily to the non-technical masses who simply want excellent devices. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus models with the Qualcomm modems are clearly better, and I would recommend those to individuals looking to buy either phone, but I just can't see any meaningful impact to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus demand based on modem gate. I can't wait to see what next year's "gate" will be.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel and Qualcomm. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple and Qualcomm.

During the build up to the release of iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, it was claimed that the company is keeping all the goodies for the 2017 iPhone 8 and 8 Plus. Despite this, the 2016 flagships have been seeing unprecedented demand ever since their release, something that could make the coming version see even more demand if Apple presses the right buttons. So, what are some of the rumored updates you can expect to see on the new iPhone 8 when compared to the current iPhone 7? Here’s a clear breakdown. Design and display Apple has used the same design for three models now, with the inaugural version being the 2014 iPhone 6. However, this is going to change drastically this coming year as the company is planning a complete redesign. The company is reportedly working on trimming the bezels of the iPhone 8 and in fact, some are adamant that Cupertino will be the first company to come in with a true bezel-less phone, meaning you get an edge-to-edge display. If this happens, we will end up with an iPhone 8 that has no physical home button and thus the Touch ID will be hidden under the screen. With talk of wireless charging in the making, Apple will supposedly ditch the aluminum casing it has used on its models for quite some time now and instead go for an all-glass design. All of these changes will mean that Apple drops the LCD display technology in favor of OLED panels, something that Sharp President, Tai Jeng-wu, has already hinted at. Samsung and other Android OEMs have been using OLED screens for some time now and it would only make more sense if Apple also made the switch. Hardware specs When iPhone 8 comes out, expect to see the next-gen processor on board, something better than what is already a very powerful A10 SoC used on the iPhone 7. Furthermore, the 2GB RAM used on the 2016 flagship should be upped to 3GB when the 2017 version comes to life. Apple made steps in the storage department of the iPhone 7 and given that this is just the first try, we expect to see the same storage options availed for the 2017 iPhone 8. Advanced battery charging As mentioned earlier, the change from aluminum to glass could mainly be aiming at adding advanced battery charging features to the 2017 iPhone 8. Most flagship devices in the Android realm already support fast wired and wireless charging, but the iPhone 7 doesn’t, thanks to its all-metal unibody. In addition to adding wireless charging capabilities, Apple is said to be working on ultra-fast charging technology to help reduce the 3.5 hours needed to fully charge the iPhone 7 Plus from 0-100%. When compared to the likes of Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge or even Google Pixel XL, this is way too long. Photography Apple stepped up its game in the photography aspects of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. This is the same thing that is expected when the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus are released next year. Apparently, reports are rife that the smaller version will also be getting the dual-lens setup that is currently exclusive to iPhone 7 Plus. There are also reports that Apple may consider going the DSLR way, but this is just a rumor. Nonetheless, the iPhone 8 will come with a better camera than what the current iPhone 7 is offering, if at all past trends are to be observed. USB C connectivity Many Android flagships released in the second half of 2016 have been coming in with support for USB-C connectivity. However, Apple iPhone 7 and 7 Plus did not come with this connector, instead, the company went for the proven USB 2.0. This will be no more when it comes to the iPhone 8 as the company will be looking to match the standards offered by its competitors. The newest reports to come in indicate that Apple could make a shift as far as the screen sizes are concerned. Apparently, the 2017 iPhone 8 will carry a 5-inch screen while the larger iPhone 8 Plus will feature an even larger 5.8-inch screen.

Earnings per share were NT$2.01 in the July-to-September quarter, compared with NT$2.42 in the same period last year, the company said. However, the firm’s results beat the average estimate of NT$33.3 billion forecast by nine analysts polled by Capital IQ. Hon Hai bought a ￥388.8 billion (US$3.64 billion) 66 percent stake in Sharp on Aug. 12 and started to include the Japanese firm’s earnings on its balance sheet in the third quarter, during which Sharp posted a net loss of ￥17.9 billion. The company said its non-operating income remained in positive territory last quarter, although it was eroded to some extent by a 3 percent appreciation in the New Taiwan dollar. Hon Hai, which has not yet filed its latest income statement with the Taiwan Stock Exchange, on Friday declined to reveal exact figures for its Sharp investment loss. Analysts estimate the loss to be from NT$1 billion to NT$1.2 billion. The firm’s net profit in the third quarter represented a 95.87 percent increase from the second quarter, Hon Hai said, attributing the improvement to contribution from a major client’s new communication products. Apple launched the iPhone 7 series in September. Hon Hai is widely believed to have won the largest contract to assemble the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus models, while Wistron Corp (緯創) also has orders for the iPhone 7 Plus and Pegatron Corp (和碩) for the iPhone 7. Hon Hai’s gross margin expanded 1.42 percentage points from the previous quarter to hit a record high of 7.44 percent in the third quarter, while its operating margin grew by 1.65 percentage points sequentially to 3.91 percent, as the company posted a 16.5 percent quarterly growth in revenues. The company said a loss reversal from a previous inventory valuation also helped boost its margins for last quarter. Market watchers expect rising revenues for this quarter on the back of iPhone sales, with Credit Suisse on Nov. 2 predicting revenues would rise 26 percent quarterly to NT$1.35 trillion and Morgan Stanley on Nov. 1 forecasting revenues would grow 49.53 quarterly to NT$1.6 trillion. “Overall results were good,” Yuanta Securities Investment Consulting Co (元大投顧) analyst Vincent Chen (陳豊丰) wrote in a client note yesterday, referring to the firm’s third-quarter data. Chen said the outlook should be reasonably good for Hon Hai going forward, shrugging off concerns about US president-elect Donald Trump’s stated aim of bringing manufacturing jobs back to the US. Hon Hai manufactures most of its products, including iPhones, for global brands in China. “The outlook for next year is promising, owing to the newly designed iPhone 8, and partly because of a likely turnaround of Sharp in the first quarter of next year,” he wrote. “In our view, Trump’s goal would not really be feasible for the iPhone in the foreseeable future. It might be possible, but we are unsure when.” In the first three quarters of this year, Hon Hai’s combined net profit reached NT$79.89 billion, down 14.94 percent from the same period last year, with earnings per share of NT$4.62. Accumulative sales totaled NT$3.42 trillion in the first 10 months of the year, also down 3.63 percent year-on-year, company data showed. This story has been viewed 1556 times.

Customers have been calling for new, high resolution Apple Thunderbolt displays for some time. Thankfully, at last the "Hello Again" event, Apple debuted its new notebooks alongside two new LG monitors which it said had been specifically designed 'in partnership' to complement the new MacBook Pro range. The move marks a departure for Apple, and appears to confirm the end of Apple producing its own external displays in favor of inviting third parties to fill the gap. The discount is available directly from Apple, with the new pricing already applied to its online store. The updated pricing is as follows: 21.5" 4K UltraFine Display - £471/$524 (discounted from £629/$700) 27" 5K UltraFine Display - £884/$974 (discounted from £1179/$1300) Like the discounts that Apple has applied to its USB-C adapters, the price reduction is for a limited time only. With the offer expiring at the end of the year, it may provide enough of an incentive for those people thinking of purchasing the new MacBook Pro before the Christmas holidays. The new monitors are not expected to reach customers until December.

Will the iPhone 8 come out next year? Fans are looking forward to a faster and more unique installment. (Photo: Photo: Apple/YouTube) The iPhone 7 has just been released but many Apple fans are already anticipating the next smartphone offering of the company. Next year will be another exciting year for Apple as it is believed to skip releasing the iPhone 7s and proceed with the iPhone 8. Advertisement With the rumored release of the iPhone 8 next year, many iPhone users are now curious on how it will be compared to the recently released Apple phone. Here is a comparison of the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 8: Design and display Unlike the traditional design of the Apple phone which was still used in the iPhone 7, the iPhone 8 is believed to be released without the home button. This is primarily because the phone could come with a thinner design. Though the next iPhone is expected to have a similar screen size than the iPhone 7, fans are hoping that the iPhone 8 could come with an OLED display. When released last September, the iPhone only had an IPS LCD display. Camera Because of the positive reviews on the dual-camera of the iPhone 7 Plus, it is anticipated that the iPhone 8 variants will all have dual cameras which are equipped with lens almost the same as DSLR cameras. Improving on this camera technology will set Apple aside from other smartphones and will be a welcome addition to many photography enthusiasts. RAM and processor An A10 processor and 2GB of RAM came with the iPhone 7. Next year, the iPhone 8 could have a more powerful chipset, the A11 processor, and a higher RAM. Apple will surely promise a more useful and faster smartphone in the iPhone 8. Advertisement There is still no confirmation from Apple that it will indeed release the iPhone 8 next year but fans are hoping for a better and well developed smartphone.

By: Tech Desk | Updated: November 14, 2016 1:07 pm Apple iPhone 8 is said to come with a receiver inside it, which will connect to a transmitter plugged into wall socket to charge the device. (Image: Apple iPhone 7 Plus) Apple iPhone 8 is expected to launch with a radical new design next year, which also marks the 10th anniversary of company’s iPhone line-up. And people can’t stop talking about the upcoming iPhone. Now, according to a report in BGR, the Cupertino giant is working with Energous to introduce wireless charging technology for iPhone 8. If rumours are anything to go by, the wireless technology being developed by Apple is like no other we’ve seen yet. Apple iPhone 8 is said to come with a receiver inside it, which will connect to a transmitter plugged into wall socket to charge the device. The iPhone 8 will charge wirelessly as long as you’re within 15 feet of the transmitter. “In other words, a view strategically placed base stations in your home and office could ensure that your iPhone is charging constantly while it’s in use or sitting in your pocket, on your desk or anywhere else,” the report said. Neither Apple nor Energous has come forward to confirm the report. The concept of wireless charging has been there for a couple of years now. Samsung was the first major player to introduce dual wireless charging for its Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge. The circular pad charges smartphones without the need to connect your device to a cable. There’s charging stand and charging pads that support up to 3 devices as well. However, all of these are required to connect to a socket via cable before they can charge a smartphone wirelessly. Apple’s concept on the other hand totally eliminates the need of cables to charge iPhone. Earlier reports suggest iPhone 8 will feature a glass back and an OLED display. According to Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI securities, the 2017 iPhone will not be featuring an aluminium back – instead the phone will come with a glass back (reportedly developed by Biel and Lens). A report from Nikkei has shared a statement from a Sharp executive (Sharp is an Apple supplier) who said that the 2017 iPhone will be adopting an OLED display. Another Nekkei report has said that there will be an additional screen size for the iPhone 8 – a 5-inch version, and might also feature a 2.5D glass.

Both products will soon be available in a color called "Citrus Red," joining other standard color options. Apple's website lists both products as "coming soon" with price points that are the same as standard options. The Beats Solo3 Wireless Headphones in Citrus Red is priced at $299.95, while the Citrus Red Beats Pill+ is priced at $229.95. Apple has a longstanding partnership with the (PRODUCT)RED charity, and all proceeds from the sales of (PRODUCT)RED items go towards the global fight to prevent AIDS and HIV through research and education. Apple often runs (PRODUCT)RED promotions around World Aids Day, coming up in December, in addition to continual (PRODUCT)RED accessory sales. Over the course of a multi-year relationship, Apple has donated upwards of $100 million through (PRODUCT)RED sales. Along with new (PRODUCT)RED options for the Beats Pill+ and the Beats Solo3, Apple also recently debuted urBeats Earphones and Beats Solo 3 Wireless Headphones in an exclusive Ultra Violet color, which is a rich medium purple shade.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India US World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Smartphones Apple iPhone 8 leak: iPhone 7 series successor to come in bigger and bezel-less screen Apple's iPhone 7 series successor, iPhone 8 is expected to come with massive upgrades in terms of design language and display panel. Rohit KVN   November 13, 2016 19:30 IST 1 Shares 1 Shares [Representational Image] Apple iPhone 8 leak: iPhone 7 series successor to come in bigger and bezel-less screen. In Picture: Apple iPhone 7 seriesApple Newsroom Apple's recently released iPhone 7 series had near-identical design language seen in the last two generation phones, inviting lots of criticism from tech pundits and fans. But, it was kind of a deliberate move by Apple to keep the design change to minimal so that the iPhone 8 series coming in September 2017, which marks the 10th anniversary of the first Apple iPhone, will have completely overhauled exterior looks (and also internal hardware) to make it standout among all the previous iterations. Rumours leaked in the recent past have suggested the iPhone 8 series will come in three screen sizes—4.7-inch, 5.0-inch and 5.5-inch — having edge-to-edge display made of power-efficient OLED.

Google Nexus 6P, Nexus 5X might get back Night mode in new Android v7.1 Nougat beta update Also read: Apple's wireless AirPods release date leaked Now, a new reliable report has emerged online giving credence to the aforementioned speculation with a little twist. MacRumors have got hold of a note of Barclays Research analysts --Blayne Curtis, Christopher Hemmelgarn, Thomas O'Malley, and Jerry Zhang—saying that the iPhone 8 series is indeed coming with bezel-less design with screen sizes getting larger and curved edges, but will be offered only in two models—one, 5.0-inch and another 5.8-inch— screens, 0.3-inch bigger than the iPhone 7 series. It is believed that the Apple, in a bid to bring the bezel-less feature to the iPhone 8 series, will let go of the physical home button, which houses the fingerprint sensor on the front display panel in current and older models. This report sounds credible to us, as it comes close on heel of a speculation emerging from Apple's newly-acquired startup PrimeSense at its Israel branch, where it has set-up a massive 600-members engineering team to work, just for the display sensor. It is believed that the new iPhone 8 will come with 3D touch sensor integrated right into the OLED screen and also boast Always On Display (AOD), like we see in the flagship Moto series and recently release Samsung Galaxy S7 series. Once the AOD feature is activated, a certain section of the display will always remain active to show live notifications, local weather and time, so that users don't need to press the power button to open the phone to see the time or messages. This will be a really big addition to Apple iPhones. Furthermore, Apple has already submitted a patent on its new technology to the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) that will enable to hide Touch ID fingerprint scanner and make a full screen device. Besides the new screen sizes and OLED display, Apple iPhone 8 series will have powerful A11 Fusion processor backed by sumptuous RAM, storage and battery (thanks to bigger body).

To date, only the non-Touch Bar 13-inch model has been made available, with other models arriving sometime next week (if you ordered early). All told, the reviews are less than glowing, with many likening the computer to a farce foisted on us by Apple. That’s certainly one way to look at it, but there’s probably something a bit more obvious at play. The ‘Pro’ computer Reading through the reviews, a few things becomes fairly evident. First, the new keyboard is going to be polarizing (I happen to love it) with its shallow key travel. Second, the massive trackpad is a welcome addition. Another notable feature on the 13-inch model is the screen. While the same resolution as the previous Retina Pro models, it’s now a lot brighter and supports the P3 color gamut. It’s just plain beautiful. But there are some professional-level disadvantages. It’s got a pretty basic CPU, the GPU is limited to Intel’s offering, and the two Thunderbolt 3 ports are going to leave you buying dongles — another not-so-pro feature many are complaining about. For all the complaining, one thing is certain: the new 13-inch, non-Touch Bar Pro is not a ‘pro’ computer at all. Often, reviews append their long-winded ranting with that notation at the end, but it misses the mark. This is Apple’s fault What we’ve quickly forgotten is that most of those reviewing the new Pro (the pesky tech press, wouldn’t you know) were ardent fanboys of the MacBook Air. I can’t tell you how many conferences I’ve been to, only to see a sea of Airs floating through the halls while I lugged my Pro around. We’ve (the royal ‘we’ here) also lost track of the biggest complaint about the Air: the screen. For so long the only thing the tech press wanted was an Air with a Retina screen. It would be the perfect computer, they’d say. Then they got one — except Apple dubbed it a ‘Pro’ computer. The Air was judged apart from the Pro because it was this sliver of aluminum Steve Jobs slipped out of an inter-office envelope and positioned as the entry-level MacBook to encompass the world outside of Pros. You know, the 99 percent (sorry ‘pros’… complain all you want, but you’re not what matters). It had pretty ho-hum specs and a middling screen resolution — but oh, the form factor! So slim, so pretty… so portable, and easy to balance on a lap while live-blogging a keynote speech from a tech conference! Instead of simply rebooting the Air lineup, Apple gave us a confusing Pro stable to pick through. Do we want the Pro non-Touch, or one with Touch Bar — and 13 or 15 inch? Did you need more RAM? Yeah, that’s only available on the 15-inch version. Sorry. The Pro is not a Pro Apple calling the 13-inch non-Touch Bar MacBook Pro (and screw them for making me type that, it’s a stupid-long name) a ‘Pro’ at all is problematic. Instead of simply rebooting the Air with a Retina screen — you know, that thing we wanted — Apple rebooted the Air with a Retina screen and called it a Pro. Except it’s not a Pro. It’s an Air… with a Retina screen. But the tech press is holding the computer to a different standard than it would a new Air, despite being very aware of what they’re doing. If Apple had simply called its basic offering a new Air, the only knock would be the form factor being exactly like the Pro (and probably Thunderbolt ports, but whatever). Even then, we wouldn’t care much… at least we’d know where it stood in the lineup. And then we’d have that ‘Air with a Retina screen’ so many have always wanted. I mean, Apple even pulled the 11-inch Air from circulation, and isn’t updating the 13-inch model. It’s clearly trying to exhaust its existing supply chain — so what other indicators do we need that the Air is dead and this new thing is its replacement? The naming scheme is Apple’s fault, but it’s poor form on the tech press for not being able to see through it more directly. That so many hold the low-end Pro to the ‘Pro’ standard Apple sets is silly. Call it what you like, it’s clearly the new Air — and should be judged as such.

Device To Go In Production In December, Barclays Analysts Say By Rishabh Jain On 11/13/16 AT 6:06 AM Close The Apple AirPods have been delayed, yet again. According to analysts, the wireless earphones might not see a 2016 release. Despite being showcased at the iPhone 7 launch in September, the earphones are yet to hit the store shelves.  Apple's official statement to TechCrunch in October stated: “The early response to AirPods has been incredible. We don’t believe in shipping a product before it’s ready, and we need a little more time before AirPods are ready for our customers.” According to 9to5Mac, Apple's Chinese supply chain had stated that the device won't be available before mid-2017 due to high demand.  Related Stories Apple Airpods Release Is Pushed Back Comparing Apple's AirPods To Other Wireless Headphones Now, Barclays analysts have released a research note to Mac Rumors, which said the device will go into production only by December 2016, making availability this year highly unlikely. The research note adds that Apple will have a limited initial production for AirPods, with just 10 to 15 million devices being shipped at first.  In fact, Apple has not included AirPods in its official 2016 Holiday Shopping Guide, hinting that the device won't be available for the holiday season. The device has been listed as "currently unavailable" with no confirmation of availability on Apple's website.  Currently, all indications point toward a 2017 availability of the device.  Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

Posted By: Arash FekriPosted date: November 14, 2016In: Technology Page 1 of 212» Apple have reportedly once again made the work of jailbreak developers more challenging, as the latest 10.2 beta for their iOS has apparently added some extra features that lock it down even more securely. At the same time, the company has been trying to balance these developments by adding new official features to the system, some of which were previously only available through a jailbroken device. The recent beta is actually one of the most major updates to hit the operating system, and it saw the addition of multiple new features, such as an improved lock screen, more customization, more features in Photos, as well as yet another revision to the design of some apps like Apple Music. The operating system now supports a special “emergency call” feature, accessible by tapping the home button five times. This allows the user to easily call emergency services without having to open the device itself, although it currently doesn’t work everywhere in the world. We expect to see it rolled out in full capacity sooner or later though, possibly once the current version gets out of beta. In the meantime, those who’re waiting for a new jailbreak tool to get full access to their devices may be disappointed to learn that there are no current rumors of a solution on the horizon. Quite on the contrary, there are reports from the jailbreak scene indicating that Apple have actually made it even more difficult to crack the system now, and we’re not sure if we’re even going to see any of the major groups putting any serious effort in the current version. Instead, they might choose to wait for Apple to bring the OS out of its current beta, although that might take a while. On the other hand, Apple also seem more interested in exploring their operating system with public betas, which is not a bad move in many regards as it allows them to iron out issues more thoroughly before bringing the system to the public. They’ve also been working on making iOS even more secure than before, so it’s questionable if jailbreak developers will even be able to find a successful solution in the upcoming versions that easily. Right now, there is a lot of speculation in the community that the game of cat and mouse might be coming to an end, as Apple have really managed to tighten their grip on the operating system. Is that ultimately a good thing though? For Apple themselves, it obviously is. This achieves their goal of controlling their operating system more tightly, while it also makes it more secure for their less experienced users. It’s true that there’s been a significant attention on jailbreak users by developers of malicious software, so it makes sense that Apple would want to make it more difficult to break through the OS. It will be interesting to follow the development of iOS in the coming months, as it’s very likely that the scene will change significantly. By the time Apple are ready to roll out iOS 11, they could have come up with a solution that completely blocks jailbreaking. If they do decide to go down that path though, they should definitely think about expanding the range of features in the operating system with a little more input from their users. After all, one of the main reasons for people to jailbreak their iOS devices is to get access to certain exclusive features that are normally not available.

As of now, there is no word whether this arrangement is limited to Europe or worldwide. Apple has not made many official comments on this matter. We just have to wait for a few more days to really know if this official release schedule of Apple AirPods is true or an false alarm. For those uninitiated, Apple AirPods is powered by Apple's proprietary W1 chip. It also with dual optical sensors and accelerometers in each AirPod that work with the W1 chip to detect when AirPods are in your ear, so they only play when you are ready to listen. If the user removes the AirPods, iPhone automatically pauses the music. Users can also access Siri by double tapping the AirPods to select and control the music, change the volume, check your battery life or perform any other Siri task. With an additional accelerometer in each AirPod, it intuitively knows whether user is speaking, enabling a pair of beam-forming microphones to focus on the sound of your voice, filtering out external noise to make your voice sound clearer. Another interesting aspect of the AirPods is its ultra-low power consumption. Apple's W1 chip operates at one-third of the power of traditional wireless chips, enabling AirPods to deliver up to 5 hours of listening time on one charge. The custom-designed charging case holds additional charge of more than 24 hours of total listening time,ensuring AirPods are charged and ready to go anytime. Air Pods will be sold as a separate accessory for $159 in US with a charging case.

Contacts Economy Arts&Culture Electronics Science Sport Worldwide Medicine Local Electronics Instant Emoji Touch Bar: A Look Inside Apple's New MacBook Pro Charles Sherman Nov 13, 2016      For the purposes of this article, we're only looking at the high-end 15 inch MacBook Pro notebooks, as they provide the best performance. The only available model is the base 13-inch MacBook Pro that comes without the fancy Touch Bar and this one is priced at U.S. $1,499. So anyone who wants a secondary monitor for their new MacBooks may opt for LG's 5K display. Apple has recently announced a long awaited update to its MacBook Pro laptops at an event in San Francisco. Much like the 12-inch MacBook, the MacBook Pro now has butterfly mechanism keys, allowing for less travel and a thinner chassis. Faced with a promising new competitor in the form of Microsoft's Surface Studio, Apple finally unveiled its new MacBook Pro during the company's keynote event on October 27. Apple is also keeping the old MacBook Pro models, which start at United States $1,299. In terms of design, the new Macbook Pro lineup is 4mm thinner than its previous generation model and weighs half a pound less. As for the new MacBook Pro 2016, the prices in the USA are $1,499 for the 13-inch model without a Touch Bar, $1,799 for the one that comes with it, and $2,399 for the 15-inch top variant. Obviously, this is not a monitor with Apple's own branding, which is an unusual veering away from Apple, who is nearly always intent on using proprietary products for respective functionalities or accessories that support its main products. The USB 3 ports have been replaced with four Thunderbolt 3 ports - USB-C cables can be plugged into these. Speaking of the main Retina display, Schiller said the new MacBook Pro's screen is brighter and has a wider color gamut than its predecessor; 2,560-by-1,600 resolution at 227ppi on the 13-inch and 2,880-by-1,800 resolution at 220ppi on the 15-incher. Any of the thunderbolt ports can be used to charge the device. It is worth noting that the slimmest laptop available are the HP's Spectre and Acer's Swift 7, both running on the seventh-gen "Kaby Lake" Intel Core i7 processors and both less than 10mm thick. The 13inch MacBook Pro (2.9GHz Intel i5, 8GB RAM, 256GB onboard storage) with standard function keys will sell at $1,499 and $1,799 with the new Touch Bar. You can check out all the models as well as their prices over at Apple.com via link below. The Touch Bar-equipped 13-inch MacBook Pro starts at USA $1,799 while the two 15-inch MacBook Pro versions, coming with Touch Bar, start at U.S. $2,399 and United States $2,799.

Tech News Downloads Software Store Search for: BetaNews Hot Topics: Windows 10 Microsoft Apple Cloud Tablets Android Security Reviews Follow Us: Twitter Facebook Linked-in RSS The case for Trump: Why Donald bests Hillary on key tech policies By Derrick Wlodarz Published 1 week ago 52 Comments Tweet Solely based on media coverage, you'd think that all of Silicon Valley and the tech world at large was undoubtedly behind Clinton in this critical election. But as has been reported in muted fashion by a few outlets, there is such a thing as the "silent majority" which is going to surprise many this election. I'm confident that polls are having a hard time capturing the factor that quantifies this part of the electorate which isn't being vocal about its Election Day preferences, but will deliver a decisive blow come Tues Nov 8. Those in the tech industry publicly supporting Trump are far and few in between. And it's not entirely surprising. With the amount of undue heat that Peter Thiel, a gay conservative who co-founded PayPal, is receiving, it's not shocking to see many staying mum about their preferences. But with such an important election at stake, and with candidates who I see as having vastly different consequences for America, sitting idle and staying silent is perhaps a worse reality than risking standing on the losing side of Election 2016 history. I'm a small IT business owner and a decade-long IT pro, and I'm standing with Trump on the issues closest to my heart: technology issues and their related policies. After spending over a year following this election closely, here's why Trump has it right on the critical tech issues I care most about. And while I'm admittedly not an authority on topics such as military policy or global politics, my entrenchment in the IT industry gives me a nuanced perspective on tech that mass media at large is inherently foreign to. Hillary's Email Server: Gross IT Negligence of National Security Perhaps the single most important tech issue that has been out in front this entire election cycle is Hillary's blatant, careless usage of a private email server. There are numerous reasons why IT pros should take Hillary to task for how -- as the nation's top Diplomat -- she blatantly dropped the ball regarding classified intelligence handling. Not only is Hillary's situation a disgraceful obstruction of justice, as there are countless others in lesser positions who have been punished tenfold for doing far, far less with confidential data. But to me, as someone who takes IT security very seriously for my managed IT clients, everything about Hillary's situation stinks to high heaven. From the fact that she hired (brilliant!) tech experts to stage her email server to be housed in a bathroom closet for a time. Down to how Hillary's team ordered the company to wipe away critical evidence using BleachBit, and then to top it off, we learn that key IT pros involved in creating this mess have been given blanket immunity and made a mockery of Congress when brought in for questioning this year by hiding behind the fifth amendment. And then we find out that this IT expert was caught sneaking around Reddit looking for advice on how to strip out emails related to a "VERY VIP" kind of person (read: Hillary Clinton). In August 2015, Hillary Clinton was asked by a reporter if her server was wiped clean to avoid discovery by investigators. In response, she laughably responded by saying, "What? With a cloth or something?" Her usage of a private email server has been a consistent marker of dishonesty and negligence of IT policy and national security alike. (Image Source: DailyMail.co.uk) At every turn, Hillary and her extended entourage of aides and experts have snubbed the law and flaunted getting away with it. And while Hillary believes she is breathing easier due to FBI Director Comey brushing up excusing her email follies, lest we forget that her namesake Clinton Foundation is very much still under the investigative radar for 'pay to play' allegations. As fast as Hillary puts out one fire, another one billows smoke just around the other corner. From my perspective, if Hillary could not properly handle crucial decision making on critical IT systems handling our nation's secrets, how would she possibly fare better with such decisions as the leader of the free world? History speaks numbers, and Hillary's track record with confidential IT platforms is pathetic at best. Compounded with how many decades Hillary has been in politics, not to mention already having spent two tenures residing at the White House, it's utterly unconscionable how she can stand behind such careless, negligent behavior. H-1B Visa Reform: Bringing IT Jobs Back to America As a Park Ridge, IL (USA) based tech company owner, I'm extremely proud of the fact that I can give jobs to deserving local Americans. If you had to ask me, I would rather close up my managed IT services business than stoop down to the levels of Disney, for example, which laid off most of its USA based tech staff in place of foreign (read: cheap) laborers. Yet the company had no shame -- it forced the staff it was booting into unemployment to stay on hand to train their H-1B toting replacements before being shown the door. But Disney isn't the first company to be tempted into ditching quality American labor in place of foreign workers who are able and willing to work for pennies on the dollar. One of H-1B's biggest proponents, the mighty Mark Zuckerberg, uses the false narrative of being hungry for more skilled labor to cover up his real motives. As an employer, yes, keeping my payroll full of American-based labor is expensive by every token. I probably could cut labor costs by 1/3 to 1/2 by outsourcing my key positions to H-1B visa holders, or better yet -- hiring talent that is based solely overseas. But being a small business owner for some time now has given me considerable satisfaction in the notion that we can make a profit all the while employing local, deserving, and extremely motivated Americans. I find companies like Disney and Facebook to be on the wrong side of history. And Donald Trump is the one making it very clear that companies taking advantage of foreign labor at the expense of qualified deserving Americans will pay the price. Not only should H-1B caps be lowered, but policies should be enacted that force companies abusing this loophole to pay equitable salaries that are comparable to what they would have paid for hiring local talent -- thereby eliminating any financial benefits from this scourge on the IT industry. Tech Corporations and Privacy: Why Common Sense Supersedes Ideological Purity I've long been a believer that strong device and network security is an important facet to a sound IT infrastructure we can depend on. But putting security on a pedestal based solely around technical, ideological purity is foolish -- and downright eventual suicide. It's why when Apple was getting the praises of the sing-along IT media for standing up to the FBI this past February in the San Bernardino case, I stood against the grain and explained why they were downright wrong from both a technical and policy perspective. Not surprisingly, Donald Trump saw matters in a similar light. This was a clear cut case of Apple having the capability to disable the mechanisms enforcing forced wipe after incorrect pincode entry on its iPhone 5c device, and nothing to do about handing over much-discussed "master keys" to the encryption backbone for its flagship smartphone line. But while I previously outlined the raw technical reasoning for why Apple was clearly in the wrong (based on findings by a security expert), the crux of this matter when it comes to the election surrounds how our national security policy should be shaped in light of these increasingly common situations. When lives are at stake, should corporations be allowed to stand behind false veils of privacy to uphold their public image? If long term damage to the tenets of encryption and device security are not at risk, then I clearly believe these firms should be held accountable to the public. When it came to the famous FBI-Apple case from Feb 2016, Donald Trump and I saw eye to eye on Apple's shameless behavior. (Image Source: CNN) Should corporations, in the face of grave public danger and desirable national security interests, be forced to comply with court orders that are feasible and more importantly, reasonable? Yes and yes. In the San Bernardino case, Apple would have sacrificed zero in terms of long term device security by reverse engineering the former terrorist's device. But they proved quite clearly that they had an ego to uphold and this sadly shaped the PR of their decision making. Trump publicly blasted Apple for its actions in its FBI battle earlier this year, as I did, and I think he would take a similar nuanced position in future cases of overarching public safety. The Long Term Stability of DNS: Why ICANN Control Belongs in America's Hands Since the inception of the Internet as we know it, America has held the reigns of the very core facets that allow us to .com to this and .org to that. The topmost reigns of the Domain Name System (DNS), known as Top Level Domains (TLDs), have been under the helm of ICANN which has been inherently controlled by America. This has been the status quo for over two decades and has worked as intended, without flaw, and without interference. As the de-facto protector of the free world and its many tenets -- yes, including DNS and a free internet -- the USA has proven its stewardship as the controlling interest over ICANN to be beneficial for all, not just America. But control of ICANN is not merely a game of showmanship. There's a lot at stake on the world stage when it comes to the one platform that upholds the interlinks among the entire global economy, free speech, and everything else in between. Now since ICANN has been transferred out of the hands of the USA and into the grasp of a multinational global entity, the future of the open internet could be chipped away by the intentions of nations which would use a mask of "global interest" to impose their own censorship, or worse. Years back I penned about the dangers of allowing such abhorrent violators of internet freedom to have seats at the global WWW policy table. With ICANN now into uncharted waters, it's easy to see why these fears may bear resemblance to unfolding real world events at some point. Trump stands with me on this opinion and has opposed the handover of ICANN control since the beginning. It will undoubtedly be near impossible to reverse this handover, but Trump's dedication in keeping America's adherence to freedom and liberty when it comes to internet affairs is a key indicator of how he would rule on future related issues. And this is a big reason why his ticket is easier to stand behind over that of Hillary Clinton. Trump Isn't Perfect, But Clinton Cannot be Trusted This election has proven to be a whirlwind in many ways. However, there's one aspect which isn't that radical from previous elections: there is no such thing as the perfect candidate. You'll never be able to say that the leading candidates check off every box on your mental tally list of policy stances. But this very notion is the one which has pegged my support for Trump. Yes, he's said things which are indefensible. Yes, he isn't the most concrete, bona-fide conservative of the field which was offered. But the American public voted him through the primaries by large margins, and he ended up as the GOP nominee. I've compared, contrasted, and added up the positions which matter most in my eyes, and Trump is the one which stands tall above Clinton on numerous policies -- most importantly, tech policy which is near and dear to me both personally and professionally. Supporting Trump as an IT pro this election cycle is seemingly a minority viewpoint in the unfortunately homogenous tech industry, but that's never bothered me in the past. Because it may very well be the silent majority which vindicates Trump in the end.

Google uses Chrome's reach to give your phone a better web 0 Share: Software by Stephen Shankland 11 November 2016 6:29 am AEDT @stshank Up Next Facebook may have built then ditched an update to fight fake news A Google Chrome lapel pin Photo by Stephen Shankland/CNET The web has taken a beating in the smartphone era. But it's about to start beating back. Explosive growth of the web, starting in the 1990s, connected the world's population. In the last decade, though, we all started tapping app icons instead of web hyperlinks to chat with friends, share photos and buy products online. Now Google's Chrome team and browser allies from Mozilla, Opera and Microsoft are putting a new twist on things. It's called progressive web apps, or PWAs. They endow websites with many of the advantages of native apps that run on Google's Android or Apple's iOS. And they can outdo native apps when it comes to fast, hassle-free loading. PWAs are headlining this week at the Chrome Dev Summit, Google's two-day conference in San Francisco for programmers who want to figure out where Google is taking browser technology. Native apps hog the spotlight, but at the conference, Google will reveal a good reason why browsers generally and Chrome in particular also deserve a place on the stage: unbeatable reach. "We have over 2 billion Chrome instances that are active" each month, said Darin Fisher, Google's vice president of Chrome engineering and the conference's opening speaker. That amounts to fewer than 2 billion people, because a single person can use Chrome on multiple devices, but it's still a platform with immense power. That power is essential to making Google's vision a reality. If it succeeds, that browser icon might be the one you reach for on your home screen a lot more often. Website usage tracking firm StatCounter says browser use on mobile devices just exceeded PC browsing worldwide. Photo by StatCounter Success on that front also could help restore the fortunes of the web, the closest the computing industry has come to freeing us from software that works only on one device or another, like a Windows laptop but not an iPhone. In an era when tech giants wield tremendous power, the web levels the playing field and makes it easier for new competitors to join the game. It's no wonder Google is pushing the mobile web. This month, browser usage on tablets and phones for the first time surpassed usage on PCs, analytics firm StatCounter said. App fatigue Apps might get the glory, but the web does a lot of the work already. When we need to interact with a business or service, a website is often our first point of contact. Apps are popular, with millions available in Apple and Google app stores, but it's hard to convince people to install them, and even then, most lie dormant. Among American adults, "almost half...report that they use five or fewer apps at least once per week, and just 16 percent indicate that they use more than 10 apps on a regular basis," a 2016 Pew Research Center study found. And Localytics, which monitors app usage, found that 23 percent of users never reopen an app after the first time and that only about a fifth of people are likely to still use an app after three months. Darin Fisher, vice president of Chrome engineering, speaks at Google's Chrome Dev Summit. Photo by Stephen Shankland/CNET Fisher isn't pronouncing native apps dead, but he thinks PWAs means the web can shoulder more of the load. "It's expensive to get people to install an app," Fisher said, but progressive web apps arrive fast through the browser to keep visitors happy, then download extra abilities silently in the background. For website developers, he said, "there's really no fundamental limit to the kinds of experiences you can create." There's a place for both apps and websites, analyst firm Gartner believes. "A mobile website is more generic, with wider reach, like your ABC or CBS or Fox or NBC channels," said Research Director Jason Wong, while native apps are akin to "a cable channel like the Cooking Channel or MTV targeted toward a specific segment." Apps are great for people who use a company's services are lot, like the 10 percent or 15 percent of users who come back to an e-commerce site frequently, but websites are crucial for the rest. "The mobile web is unavoidable. Users are using smartphones and tablets to access websites more and more. Google has changed its [search] algorithm to reward mobile-optimized websites," Wong said. "It's imperative companies move to responsive and mobile-optimized websites." Progressive web what? If you're browsing the web, you won't see any fancy label announcing a progressive web app. But done well, you'll like it. The first idea behind a PWA is that websites arrive as fast as possible in basic form so you can get started immediately, then gradually flesh themselves out in the background -- thus the term progressive. Compare that to a typical native app that often requires you to download tens of megabytes of data and wait for an installation before you can get started. They're not for every situation right now -- games, for example. But PWAs can be appropriate for lots of situations with native apps, like social networking, e-commerce, news and streaming video. PWAs also download components so they work offline. And they take advantage of push notification abilities for the web -- for example, Carnival Cruise's site can prompt customers to finalize a reservation before it expires in 24 hours. And PWAs can be placed as a home-screen icon so you're more likely to use them again. The results have convinced companies like the Washington Post, Housing.com in India and Chinese e-commece giant Alibaba. Also, CNET launched its own progressive web app Thursday.

Enlarge Image Thao Tran, head of global partnerships for Google, shows at Chrome Dev Summit how much less expensive it's been for Housing.com to woo new customers with its progressive web app. Photo by Stephen Shankland/CNET When Alibaba moved to a PWA, it found a website visit was 76 percent more likely to convert into a website transaction. Among Android device users, monthly usage increased 30 percent, and for those with iPhones and iPads, monthly usage increased 14 percent. PWAs are particularly popular in developing countries where mobile networks are slow and coverage is spotty, said Alex Komoroske, a Chrome group product manager. Using a cheap, low-end Android phone with an older 3G connection, downloading FlipKart's e-commerce native app took 14 minutes, but the company's progressive web app took 14 seconds, he said. Where's Apple? Google has built into Chrome much of the required supporting technology, including push notifications. Mozilla's Firefox and Microsoft's Edge are on board, too, making it safer for web programmers to bet on PWAs. Apple hasn't joined the party with its Safari browser, but Fisher is optimistic. If 50,000 website developers start using PWA technologies, "you can imagine Safari engineers will see there's a lot of interest," Fisher said. "Developers can have some influence, voting with their feet for what they care about." Apple didn't respond to a request for comment. Apple forbids other browser makers from using their own browser engines on iPhones and iPads, so running Chrome doesn't enable PWAs on those devices. Apple's lack of support is "a real concern for developers," Fisher said, but embracing the PWA approach still boosts performance on Apple's iOS-powered devices. Easier payments And progressive web apps will benefit from web payment technology where Apple is ahead, letting you easily complete a purchase with Apple Pay. A more general technology, the web payments interface, is coming to mobile browsers to connect to Android Pay , a credit card, Alibaba's AliPay service, Apple Pay, or whatever other payment mechanism your phone offers. It all leads to vast improvements over the plodding, hard-to-read websites still common with mobile browsing. "Everybody should be building a progressive web app," Fisher said. "It just makes sense."

More than just technology news Home Tech Reviews Science Games Culture Video Stay Connected Facebook Twitter RSS Updated Hot Tags Pokemon Go Apple Pokemon Go Update Science Donald Trump 2016 MacBook Pro vs. 2017 MacBook Air: Apple's Plans For Its Future Mac Products Adie Pie First Posted: Nov 12, 2016 04:13 AM EST The MacBook Air has always been the more affordable alternative to the MacBook Air. But, if the rumors prove true in the next few months, the 2017 MacBook Air will be much more than just an alternate. Credit:Stephen Lam/Getty Images On October 27, when Apple officially unveiled the 2016 MacBook Pro, there was no news about the next generation of the MacBook Air. And while the new device is lighter and thinner than its predecessors, there was still a gap left for an entry-level notebook from the Cupertino-based company. If the rumors are anything to go by, however, this whole will soon be filled. The 2016 MacBook Pro, which has started shipping out, is a spectacular piece of technology. As Apple Insider notes, the 15-inch model, which automatically comes with the innovative Touch Bar, is able to smoothly edit 5K ProRes footage on Final Cut Pro X. The publication even goes as far as to state that the new unit runs faster than its Windows counterparts, which boast superior specifications. The previously mentioned Touch Bar provides users with quick access to various features and shortcuts that are specific to the opened application. The entire feature supposedly makes the experience of using the 2016 MacBook Pro more efficient and enjoyable. Users, essentially, have quick access to various commands because of this addition. The publication then went on to note that while having to get used to the USB Type C or Thunderbolt 3 ports might take some getting used to, it will undoubtedly be a non-issue after some months of use. This is true for most of Apple's products, which have often times pushed the limits of how technology is viewed and used by the general public. It is understandable how the 2016 MacBook Pro is no exception. Even before the 2016 MacBook Pro was officially made public, there was speculation that Apple would discontinue its line of MacBook Air units. The reasoning was that the new Pro would be lighter and thinner than any other product that the Cupertino-based company had released. And while the idea was an exciting one, there were still a group of Apple enthusiasts that were crushed at the thought. As International Business Times AU notes, Apple will likely release another MacBook Air unit before discontinuing the line altogether. Therefore, some sources have picked up on the hint of a 2017 MacBook Air device. And while the 2016 MacBook Pro is thinner and lighter than anything before it, the new Air will stick to its definition and will be even more lightweight. In addition to the slight design changes, the publication goes to say that the 2017 MacBook Air will also come with its own features, which will surely set it apart from its competition, as well as the rest of the Mac product line. Reportedly, the unit will sport an E-ink keyboard made by Sonder Design. The company has made a name for itself in creating this type of keyboard. The E-Ink Keyboard will work like the current Touch Bar on the 2016 MacBook Pro. For each application that the user opens, the entire keyboard should alter its dynamic. Whether this is in terms of language or features itself, however, is unclear. Furthermore, the 2017 MacBook Air will also reportedly no longer carry the standard USB Type A ports. Instead, the notebook is expected to arrive sporting the more modern USB Type-C ports. Unfortunately, not much else is known about the upcoming unit. It would, however, be a welcome announcement if Apple were to confirm that the 2017 MacBook Air will arrive with at least the Kaby Lake processor, as well as Touch ID support and a trackpad that can be used with the Apple Pencil.

By Feliciano Rodriguez III Posted on November 12, 2016 Share Tweet Share Share Email Get ready for another Macbook Pro 2016 alternative. This time we do a smackdown between age old rivals Apple and Microsoft. In this article, we’ll compare the new and much criticized 13-inch Macbook Pro with the Surface Book. Both of the laptops are targeted at the professional users. How will they compare with each other? Which of them is the more Pro laptop? Let’s find out.

Again, comparing the new 13-inch Macbook to its Windows competitors expose the glaring outdatedness of its 6th Generation Skylake processors. Tech commentators and Apple fans can’t comprehend why Apple chose to use a one generation old processor for its 2016 Macbook Pros. The Surface Book’s 6th Generation Skylake processor is still quick and battery efficient, even one year after its release. The Surface Book can still duke it out against newer Windows laptops like the updated Dell XPS 13, which now has the newer Intel Kaby Lake processors. Both Laptops feature a generous 8GB RAM and both have gorgeous high definition displays. Check out Microsoft’s official website for a more in-depth look the Surface Book. The Surface Book has more input output options though, compared to the Macbook Pros paltry two USB type C ports. Both laptops weigh in at around 1.4kgs, and both have great build quality. The Macbook Pro has Apple’s trademark aluminum unibody design and the Surface Book is made of two magnesium blocks. The two devices look and feel premium. The Surface Book is about $200 more expensive than the base 13-inch Macbook Pro, however, the Surface Book has a touchscreen display, and is compatible with Microsoft’s excellent proprietary Surface Pen. The Surface Book also has a unique hinge wherein the display can disconnect, transforming the Surface Book into a stand alone full tablet. The Macbook Pro cannot trump this unique feature; It doesn’t even have touch screen. Conclusion If you are fully committed or invested in the macOS ecosystem, then you have no choice but to buy the new 13-inch Macbook Pro, or wait for its more advanced brothers with the much touted OLED Touch Bars. However, if you want a unique laptop with great specs, that also transforms into a tablet, then you can’t go wrong with Microsoft’s Surface Book laptop.

The company would include the latest features and most advanced technology in its latest addition to its Mac Line. (Photo : Brian Kersey/Getty Images) Apple fans will finally get a taste of Apple's latest laptop model, MacBook Air 2017 ,as it hits the market on March 2017. The company has not disclosed details about it but lots of speculations have been spreading that virtual assistant SIRI would be a part of it along with some awesome specs and features. Advertisement Lots of tech heads have already expressed their preferences on what the MacBook Air 2017 would be. Features like the Apple Touch ID and Pencil-enable Track Pad have been the expectations from various online tech blogs and forums. In a report by Game N Guide, another feature that fans would most likely anticipate is the inclusion of virtual assistant SIRI in the MacBook Air 2017. SIRI is already present in Apple's iPhones, but now, the Cupertino tech giant is planning to incorporate that technology into their laptops as well. Compared to its predecessor, the MacBook Air 2017 will have a more compact and thinner look. According to IB Times, the laptop would also include an advanced E-Ink keyboard from Sonder Design. Apple recently teamed up with Sonder Design to manufacture the keyboards of the MacBook Air 2017. Sonder Design is famous for its keyboards so it will be a much-awaited feature to look out for. Reports from MacRumors also stated that the MacBook Air 2017 will finally get rid of the old USB-A ports and incorporate the much awaited advanced USB Type-C ports. It would definitely be a change of scenery for the Mac line. Advertisement The MacBook Air 2017 will incorporate an Intel Skylake processor in its system although fans might love to see the laptop sport the Kaby Lake chipset. But fans need take note that the company is trying to control the cost since Kaby Lake chipsets are pricey. Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, expressed that he'd want to continue the Mac line so fans should be expecting the MacBook Air 2017 pretty soon. SIRI would be expecting as well. You have already subscribed.

Microsoft Surface Studio, according to Microsoft's website, have an 28 Inch Pixel Sense Display- higher than 4K resolution, 192PPI 4500 x 3000 resolution, 10 point multi-touch, and 3:2 Aspect ratio. Schiller says that each one is good at what they do, and so adding touchscreen to the MacBook Pro or iMac come to that would compromise things. The Apple MacBook Pro is available for preorder now, and it will start arriving in a few weeks. One of the most notable traits is that it's "the lightest version of the Pro to date" with the 13-inch version being only 14.9 mm thick (compared to the previous one's 18 mm) and weighs only three pounds. Contrary to earlier speculations, the Touch Bar is not made with an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screen but with Apple's favorite retina display. Prices also took a big step up. Even the fan blades have been redesigned, allowing the MacBook Pro to be cooler and quieter. The laptops will come in silver and space gray color variations. Apple itself has promoted its latest iPad tablet, the iPad Pro, as a device capable of replacing the laptop for many users. There is less bezel and more screen this time around and the device is really thin. They are the best speakers that have been put on a laptop to date. The least expensive model, at $1,999 has a 2.2 GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 processor with turbo at 3.4GHz, 256GB PCle-based SSD, 16GB 1600MHz RAM and Intel Iris Pro graphics. Here are the changes you can expect to see. "However, Apple's ability to get holdout app makers like Netflix on board will determine how useful the app ultimately is - the proposition breaks down pretty quickly if major apps are missing". There is a natural feeling to pressing the keys, no matter how shallow they are. It spans from giving "autocomplete suggestions", showing saved bookmarks on Safari to adjusting the Apple MacBook Pro's brightness and other settings. Bob O'Donnell, president of TECHnalysis Research LLC, said before the Mac announcement that the market believes focus on the iPhone means Apple has "almost given up on Macs", which has led to losing market share to other personal computers. Apple has lived up to its promise by providing the ultimate battery for their ultimate notebook.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Real Estate Classifieds Site Archive Apple Valley residents show they want to vote on water takeover Wednesday Nov 9, 2016 at 5:46 PM Nov 9, 2016 at 6:00 PM Matthew Cabe Staff Writer @DP_MatthewCabe APPLE VALLEY — The campaign behind Measure V celebrated a decisive win Wednesday that will result in a vote prior to the town issuing bond debt to pay for a future selling price of Liberty Utilities’ water system should eminent domain prove successful. Final unofficial election results released by San Bernardino County show that more than 67 percent of Apple Valley voters approved of Measure V, which will also require a vote of the people before the town issues bond debt in excess of $10 million for any enterprise. Voters also passed the town-sponsored Measure W, which finished with more than 56 percent approval, but the measure with the most votes was set to prevail, even if the other reached the 50-plus-1 threshold, according to Town Attorney Thomas Rice. In the wake of Tuesday’s election, the Apple Valley Citizens Right to Vote on Debt committee released a statement that said the vote sent “a clear message demanding fiscal accountability from our local politicians, and rejecting the Town's desire to have a blank check on spending.” In addition, Right to Vote on Debt Co-Chair Peter Allan said the results showed that town voters “have spoken loudly and clearly.” “The town attorney,” Allan said, “who is a partner in the private law firm Best Best & Krieger, tried to undermine Measure V by creating and recommending competition with their deceptive Measure W. Voters were not fooled.” H2OWN - Our Water Now Chairman Rick Piercy saw the results differently, however. "I don't think it changes the way people feel in Apple Valley," Piercy told the Daily Press. "Our rates continue to raise exponentially, so I think there’s still anger out there ... Having two measures was confusing for people, and we (the Measure W campaign) did get a group of them. We felt like we did pretty well considering it was a David versus Goliath kind of thing." Liberty Utilities sponsored and funded Measure V's campaign. Financial disclosures show that more than $337,000 in expenditures were made throughout the election season, but Piercy thinks that total will be closer to $500,000 once closure documents are filed. "I think we spent something like $17,000 total (on the Measure W campaign) when all was said and done," he said. "For only having this little budget, we went up against some pretty big guys and got our message out. I just think they’re going to take all those costs and put them into their ratepayer packages for another increase."  After early results were released Tuesday, Pat Hanson — who proposed Measure V — called for the town to immediately cease acquisition efforts and for John Brown to step down as town attorney. But Town Manager Frank Robinson said the Town Council “is committed to protecting our community from outrageous water rates, and will continue to pursue the eminent domain action.” He added that Tuesday’s results “underscore the community’s overwhelming interest in the potential acquisition of the Apple Valley Water System — a process the Town Council began at the request of residents angry over having to pay the highest water rates in the region.” Meanwhile, Liberty Utilities offered a tempered response as officials reiterated a desire to work with the town moving forward. President of Liberty Utilities California Greg Sorensen released a short statement Wednesday that didn’t mention Measure V’s triumph, but spoke to Liberty’s possible future in the town. “We value our customers in Apple Valley,” Sorensen said, “and will give them the best possible water quality and customer service now and for generations to come.” Matthew Cabe can be reached at MCabe@VVDailyPress.com or at 760-951-6254.

Component Suppliers Reportedly Confirmed OLED Technology For Plus Line Iteration By Corazon Victorino On 11/12/16 AT 10:05 PM Close It is not surprising that Apple is already working on its next iPhones that are going to be released as the special 10th anniversary handsets of the Cupertino giant. As the year 2016 is nearing its end, more consumers are excited and eagerly awaiting information about the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus. This week, Barclays Research published a research note that reveals new details about the upcoming iOS-running smartphones.  According to AppleInsider, Barclays analysts have stated in the report that Apple fans can expect a 5-inch iPhone and a 5.8-inch variant to arrive next year. Just like earlier reports claiming the next iPhones are going to feature a major redesign compared to this year’s iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, the analysts have indicated that the new smartphones are going to come with a “bezel-less design.” Even more interesting is the claim that the larger displays of the new iPhones are going to have “curved edges.” Barclays Research analysts Blayne Curtis, Christopher Hemmelgarn, Jerry Zhang and Thomas O’Malley — the people responsible for the report — reportedly got their information from the discussions they made with Apple’s component suppliers when they made a trip to Asia this week. They have indicated in their report that supply chain sources have said that there are other differences between the two iPhones aside from the sizes of their displays.  Related Stories Apple To Launch 3 iPads In March 2017 Apple Rolls Out Apple Support App For iOS When Will Apple's AirPods Be Available To Buy Online? Comparing the two upcoming Apple handsets, the larger 5.8-inch iPhone is said to feature OLED display technology. This means that the screen of the more premium device is going to be sharper, brighter and more energy efficient than the 5-inch display that will stick with LCD technology, as per MacRumors. The report stated that aside from Samsung and LG, Apple will also order its OLED display panels from Foxconn-owned Sharp, but the latter will only start fulfilling orders from Apple by 2018.  Unfortunately, this new report trumped earlier rumors claiming that Apple is going to get rid of its iPhone’s trademark Home button. The analysts wrote that the casing of the new iPhones is going to “extend vertically as well as horizontally” to overlap the Home button.  Barclays’ report comes two months after it was revealed back in September that Apple’s working on its upcoming iPhone 8 handsets in its Herzlia, Israel offices. At the time, it was also revealed that a more advanced camera technology is arriving to the 10th anniversary iPhones.  Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Nov 12, 2016 at 4:36PM $5,000 might not seem like enough to invest in the stock market. However, $5,000 put in the right stock could blossom to more than $1 million over a few decades. Let's take a closer look at three of the most well-known examples from the tech industry -- Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO). Image source: Getty Images.  Apple Apple went public in 1980 at $22 per share. $5,000 would have been enough to buy 227 shares. After four splits, you would now own 12,712 shares, which would be worth roughly $1.3 million. Moreover, that position would be paying out nearly $29,000 in dividends per year. Apple's early years, which mainly relied on Apple II and Mac sales, were rocky. Co-founder Steve Jobs left his own company after a dispute with the board in 1985, and its products were subsequently crushed by Microsoft's rapidly growing market share across IBM PC clones. Apple's growth didn't get back on track until an older and wiser Jobs returned to Apple in 1997. With a renewed focus on sleek hardware and end-to-end control of its ecosystem, Jobs' Apple launched the iMac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad -- all hit products which redefined their respective industries. Between 1997 and 2011 -- the year Jobs resigned and passed away -- Apple's annual revenue rose from $7.1 billion to $108.2 billion. That figure hit $215.6 billion in fiscal 2016. Microsoft Microsoft went public for $21 per share in 1986. $5,000 would be enough to buy 238 shares. After nine splits, you would own 34,272 shares, which would be worth $1.99 million. You would also be earning over $53,000 in dividends per year. Microsoft's core business was built on providing an easy-to-use OS for IBM-compatible PC clones throughout the 1980s and 1990s. That product, Windows, quickly became a unifying OS for the fragmented hardware market, and gave Microsoft a firm foundation to launch additional products like Office and Internet Explorer. Between 1997 and 2007, the year the first iPhone was introduced, Microsoft's annual revenue rose from $8.7 billion to $51.1 billion. However, Microsoft missed the crucial technological shift toward mobile devices, where it fell woefully behind Apple and Google. The fragmentation of the Windows and Office markets, caused by users who didn't upgrade their "good enough" software, then throttled the tech giant's top line growth. Today's Microsoft is still struggling to grow its top line, but its aggressive shift toward mobile-first, cloud-first solutions with the universal Windows Store, Azure, Cortana, and Bing are gradually getting the company back on track. Image source: Microsoft. Cisco Cisco went public for $18 per share in 1990. You could have bought 277 shares, which would have been split 9 times into 79,776 shares. That position would be worth nearly $2.5 million today, and be paying out $83,000 in annual dividends. Cisco was a darling of the dot-com boom, surging to a split-adjusted $79 per share in March 2000. Investors, seemingly enamored with the notion that the networking company's routers and switches would link up everything in the world, bid the stock's P/E ratio up to over 200 by the end of 2000. That ratio proved unsustainable for Cisco, which only grew its net income by 35% in 2000, and the stock plunged to about $12 the following year. Since then, Cisco has evolved into a mature tech stock which is owned for income instead of explosive growth. With its core markets routers and switch markets being heavily commoditized, Cisco has pivoted toward higher-growth markets like cybersecurity, service provider video, and collaboration solutions in recent years. The key takeaway Past performance never guarantees future returns, but the growth stories of Apple, Microsoft, and Cisco show just how much patience pays off. If you had sold these stocks after they doubled or tripled, you would have missed out on the massive gains that came decades later. Therefore, never underestimate the potential of a seemingly small $5,000 investment to eventually make you a millionaire. Leo Sun owns shares of Cisco Systems.

Tweet TEHRAN (FNA)- The tenth anniversary of the iPhone range comes next year, and Apple is expected to launch something outstanding in order to mark the occasion. Thus, the iPhone 8 could be the revolutionary smartphone that Apple fans have desired for some time. Recent iPhone releases have been somewhat conservative, and followers of the iconic smartphone series are hoping for something more ambitious when the iPhone 8 launches. While the iPhone 7 has sold pretty well for Apple, The next generation smartphone will be expected to make real strides forward over this release. So how will Apple build on the iPhone 7 and how will the iPhone 8 compare to the previous generation? Here is the latest news on the most important smartphone release of 2017. iPhone 8 vs. iPhone 7 – Design Early rumors on the iPhone 8 suggest that Apple may completely redesign the smartphone for release next year. Despite the iconic nature of the iPhone design, this is probably overdue, with recent iPhone releases having been rather similar. In order to fulfil this remit, Apple may consider slimming down the bezels included in the iPhone 8. Some of the more radical suggestions have indicated that Apple could completely eliminate bezels from the device, producing an edge-to-edge display. Apple could remove the Home button from the iPhone 8 and rely on touch-based functionality instead. There have also been reports suggesting that Apple could consider switching to non-aluminum casing when the iPhone 8 is released. Ming-Chi Kuo, the infamous analyst with KGI securities, is among the sources that have suggested this. Meanwhile, president of display firm Sharp, Tai Jeng-wu, also an executive of Foxconn, recently made a speech to students at Tatung University, in which he suggested that switching to OLED is essential for Apple to halt declining sales. He described the situation as “a crisis, but also an opportunity”. Display Apple could do away with the traditional LCD display when the iPhone 8 is released, finally switching to the OLED technology which has been linked with the range in recent years. This screen technology has proved particularly popular in Samsung Galaxy devices, and it is possible that the Korean corporation will even be enlisted to provide OLED displays for the iPhone 8. These reports solidified recently, with Apple Insider noting that the multinational banking and financial services giant J.P. Morgan had uncovered some interesting information on this matter. J.P. Morgan apparently discovered a leaked purchase order for $4 billion, coinciding with a similar order uncovered in the third quarter, believed to be related to Apple outsourcing panels from Samsung in order to deliver OLED in the iPhone 8. Wireless and super-fast charging Apple has yet to support wireless charging in the iPhone range, but this is expected to alter when the iPhone 8 is released. Reports have been multiplying which suggest that Apple will finally introduce a wireless charging system in the iPhone 8 generation, and that the corporation has also been working on ultra-fast charging technology in order to ensure that this is more convenient for consumers. It is notable that the iPhone 7 Plus requires 3 hours and 30 minutes to fully charge, considered a lengthy period in comparison to competitors such as the Pixel XL and the Galaxy S7 Edge. Apple may utilize both software and hardware improvements in order to close the gap, and even supersede, competitors. USB Type-C The overwhelming likelihood is that Apple will introduce USB Type-C with the iPhone 8, ensuring that the device is on par with numerous rival devices. The iPhone 7 featured conventional USB connectors. Camera Apple has somewhat concentrated on camera upgrades in recent iPhone releases, and this is expected to continue when the iPhone 8 is released. Perhaps central to this process will be the inclusion of a dual-lens snapper in all iPhone 8 devices. The California corporation is also likely to bump up the megapixel rating of the camera, and could even consider some of the more outlandish suggestions from the past, such as a DSLR lens or the unique periscope design which has been linked with the iPhone series. What is certain is that the photographic capabilities of the iPhone 8 will be improved over the previous generation device. This is considered increasingly essential in the smartphone niche, and one way that manufacturers can particularly set aside new releases from previous generations. Processor and RAM We can expect the iPhone 8 to include 3GB of RAM when it is released, improving on the 2GB included in the iPhone 7. Apple had previously claimed that the A10 processor included in the iPhone 7 was the most powerful chip ever utilized by a smartphone. But the next generation processor will further update the iPhone concept, with the iPhone 8 likely to include the first ever true quad-core processor in Apple smartphone history. Colors Apple has placed a particular emphasis on customization options in recent device releases, and this is expected to extend to the iPhone 8 when it hits the stores next year. Central to this process will be the introduction of new colors, with a Deep Blue color option particularly mooted. Apple introduced two new colors for the iPhone 7, Jet Black and Black, So Apple may once again choose to make two new iPhone colors available in 2017. Alongside the Deep Blue, we could see some of the color schemes utilized in the Apple Watch range made available for iPhone users. Models Another recent report has suggested that Apple will introduce a five-inch iPhone 8 model in 2017, as the company continues to diversify its key product range in order to meet consumer demand. This would mean that there would be four separate iPhone models available on the market, with 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch standard iPhone 8 units accompanied by the 4-inch iPhone SE released earlier this year. iPhone X Finally, a few reports have rather outlandishly suggested that Apple could decide to brand the iPhone 8 as the iPhone X, to acknowledge the tenth anniversary of the iPhone range. An unlikely nation, but one to keep an eye on as the release date of the device nears.         LATEST STORIES (78) Iran and US: A Tale of Two Elections Supermoon in Iran's Sky Iran Eyeing NITC Listing in Int'l Stock Markets VP: World Admitting Iran's Constructive Role in Maintaining Regional Security Iraqi Interior Minister: Nearly 1,000 ISIL Terrorists Killed, Over 100 Captured in Mosul Operation Battle for Mosul Day 29: Iraqi Forces Only 3km from Mosul Airport Kurdish Fighters Seize over 550 sq/km of Raqqa from ISIL Iraqi Police Confirm Liberation of Entire Area South of Mosul City Iraq: ISIL Hits Nineveh's Al-Qayyara Town with Chemical Missiles Protests, Students Walkouts Mark Week after Trump's Win 17 Arrested Protesting at US Senator's Office Large Number of Turkish Army Tanks Arrive in Northern Syria Ex-French DM: Iran's N.

More than just technology news Home Tech Reviews Science Games Culture Video Stay Connected Facebook Twitter RSS Updated Hot Tags Pokemon Go Apple Pokemon Go Update Science Donald Trump Is Apple Working On A New Display Technology For The New iPhone, iPad? Jiran First Posted: Nov 12, 2016 04:32 AM EST After releasing its iPhone 8 and MacBook Pro this year, Apple is rumored to be launching a bezel-less design for the new iPhone and iPad. (iPhoneDigital / Flickr) Both the new iPhone and iPad are reported to be integrated with the new display technology. Specifically, it is possible that both upcoming devices of Apple will feature a bezel-less design. This is among the other major changes that the tech company will do. A Larger Screen For iPhone 8 According to the Fortune, Barclays analysts Blayne Curtis and Christopher Hemmelgarn suggested that the iPhone 8 will have a larger screen than the iPhone 7. Business Insider reported that the iPhone 8 will offer a 5-inch screen. The iPhone 8 Plus will have a 5.8-inch display. This is a bit larger than the 4.7-inch iPhone 7 and 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus. The change of the screen size may have something to do with the rumored bezel-less design of the iPhone 8. The obvious difference would be the curved display of the left and right side of the screen. For comparison, it is akin to the edges of the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. This can be achieved if Apple will use the organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screen technology. Other smartphones already use this particular technology. But it would just be the first time for the tech giant if this pushes through for iPhone 8. Analysts added that the plastic OLED screen will allow a curved bezel-less edge. Apple is yet to confirm this. The New Apple iPad Apple has already announced the release of its new tablets in March. According to the Digital Trends, there might be an iPad with a bezel-free 10.9-inch design. Though the screen size may be larger, the device will have the same physical size as the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. Like in the case of the iPhone 8, such display indicates that it will be the end for the Home button. That is at the cost of having an edge-to-edge design. Apple has been tight-lipped with details about its new devices. Fortune further reports that according to a KGI Securities analyst, Apple is likely to offer OLED and curved display in the iPad in 2018.

Analysts believe the company will release a less expensive 9.7-inch iPad Pro, an updated 12.9-inch model and a new 10.9-inch bezel-less screen that will be the same size as the 9.7-inch iPad Pro.  ( Apple ) Advertisement A new report claims Apple is planning to release three new iPad Pro tablets in March 2017. The 12.9-inch and 9.7-inch will be updated, and a 10.9-inch bezel-less model will be the same size as the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. Recent reports have claimed that Apple isn't planning to release an updated version of its iPhone SE in at a press event in March 2017 and is instead reportedly planning to release next-generation versions of its 12.9-inch iPad Pro and 9.7-inch iPad Pro. The company is also slated to introduce a new member to its iPad Pro family in the form of a new 10.9-inch model, with a unique display. A group of analysts are reporting that the company will introduce the three new iPad Pro models and will offer one at a much more affordable price. According to a research note obtained by MacRumors from Barclays Research analysts Blayne Curtis, Christopher Hemmelgarn, Thomas O'Malley, and Jerry Zhang, Apple will launch three new iPads in March 2017. The new iPads will consist of updates to both the current 12.9-inch and 9.7-inch iPad Pro. The analysts say that Apple is planning to price the 9.7-inch iPad Pro at a lower price and market it as a "low-cost" tablet alongside the current iPad mini 4, which is not expected to be updated. Low-cost could mean the return of the $499 or lower starting price that Apple has offered its 9.7-inch iPads for, before the same sized screen iPad Pro was released in March with a more expensive starting price of $599. The most interesting information pertains to a new 10.9-inch iPad Pro that will supposedly feature a bezel-less display and will allow the slate to be the same size as the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, which has bezels and a physical Home button. Next year's iPhone 8 is widely expected to feature a bezel-less curved display that will have a virtual force touch Home button and Touch ID fingerprint scanner embedded directly into the display, which might make its debut on the upcoming 10.9-inch iPad Pro. iPad Pro fans should expect new accessories that make use of the tablet's Smart Connector, which allows the tablets to easily connect to accessories via a proprietary port that saves power since it does not require Bluetooth. The 2017 iPad Pro models may also support an updated version of Apple Pencil, which would lower the price of the first-generation model, while the Apple Pencil 2 would be more fine-tuned and gain additional features. As always, we'll keep you posted on any new iPad Pro details as they become available.

Tuesday November 15, 2016 US WORLD PERSECUTION MINISTRY CULTURE VIDEO Subscriptions Homepage US iPhone 8 release date, news details, specs, price rumors: Apple to work with Sharp and Energous to ensure new features Gracezyl Blanco 12 November, 2016 12:42 PM Like Us Share on Facebook Share on Twitter (Reuters/Beck Diefenbach)iPhone 7's successor may come with a wireless charging feature. Months after Apple released its new 2016 phones — iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus during the Apple Event in September, many fans of the company are already eager for the next generation of iPhones, the iPhone 8, which is expected to sport game-changing features in the smartphone industry. The iPhone 8 is expected to be unveiled at the next Apple launching event in 2017, and since it is also Apple's 20th anniversary next year, many are expecting that it will sport a breakthrough organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screen. It is speculated that Apple will also work with Sharp to come up with new iPhone 8 screens. Aside from that, the new iPhone 8 screen is speculated to have an in-built home button, and will feature a curved display. The upcoming phone is also speculated to have a glass-cased front and back cover. Moreover, Apple is also speculated to add a wireless charging ability for the iPhone 8. As to how this will work, details state that a new system will allow users to charge the iPhone for at least 15 feet away from its dock. It is further speculated that the company will work with Energous on this. In addition, the upcoming phone is said to carry additional security measures that includes an iris scanner and a face-detection system, and it will be powered by an A11 processor chip. Finally, the iPhone 8's speculated price is set at around $600 upon release or around £540 in the United Kingdom. Many fans and Apple aficionados were disappointed that Apple failed to equip the iPhone 7 with new, game-changing features which is usually the company's edge when it comes to the smartphone industry. Many however hoped that the company will be able to pull it off next year with the iPhone 8's launch.

More than just technology news Home Tech Reviews Science Games Culture Video Stay Connected Facebook Twitter RSS Updated Hot Tags Pokemon Go Apple Pokemon Go Update Science Donald Trump Apple News: Low-cost iPad Coming In 2017 JR O. First Posted: Nov 12, 2016 04:18 AM EST Apple might actually refresh its iPad line next year. (The Verge / YouTube) Apple may have skipped the iPads during their September and November events but it looks like the company will finally freshen up its tablet line next year. Barclays analysts say that Apple will once again refresh their iPad series in 2017. In fact, three new tablets might come out of Apple's doors in a few months' time. One of which is a low-cost version of the iPad Pro 9.7. Apple iPads 2017 According to GSM Arena, Apple will release refreshed versions of the iPad Pro 9.7 and 12.9 inch. There will also be a device similar to the iPad Air 2 but with no bezels. As for the lower-cost version of the iPad Pro 9.7, it was said that there is a good chance that this iPad will no longer be called "Pro". This, of course, is due to the fact that it would be low cost. Phone Arena says that this iPad will have entry-level specs. Apple iPads 2017 Release There is still no clarity as to when Apple will be releasing the new iPads. However, a March 2017 launch isn't exactly off the table considering the March release of the iPad Pro 9.7. Hopefully, Apple does release the new iPads as early as March so as to avoid making the iPad line a little too outdated. The affordable variant and the bezel-less variant are both welcome additions to Apple's iPad line. This new report, of course, also triggers the rumor that the iPhone 8 2017 could also come with a bezel-less screen. This couldn't be impossible considering the rumors that the next iPhone will have glass exteriors. Needless to say, whatever Apple has planned for its devices next year, it's almost certain that they will hype the Apple fan base once again. It's safe to say that 2017 should be a busy year for Apple not only because of the iPad refresh but also for the anniversary iPhone release.

Tech experts have been reporting that Apple’s new tablet is only months away from being launched. Launch Date The most opportune time for Apple to unveil their new tablet was in October, but Apple chose to release their new MacBook instead. Speculations are pointing out the fact that it might be too late now for the tablet to be launched during 2016, and we can expect it to drop around March 2017. There are some rumors saying that Apple is going to release the tablet in two variants, the 10.5 inch variant and the more affordable 9.7 inch one. Model Name Apple is not keeping their tradition of naming each different version of a product differently, instead of naming the new tablet the iPad Pro 2 they are going to simply name it the iPad Pro. They made the same decision with the iPad Pro versions. Apple Pencil One of the selling points in the iPad Pro series is the Apple Pencil. The device is a pressure sensitive pen that the user can use to take notes or to draw on the tablet. New feature might be implemented in the new iPad pro, and users might be able to send hand written emails, or even draw on web pages. A feature that was inspired from what Microsoft has done with their own pen. Hardware Apple is supposedly going to upgrade the tablet’s camera department and equip it with a 12MP primary camera and a 5MP secondary one. The display is going to see some improvements as well, receiving the True Tone feature. Apple has just introduced the A10 Fusion processor in their iPhone 7 line of devices, and they are expected to install it in the iPad Pro as well. The processor is going to be a great addition to the tablet, it will improve its performance and at the same time its battery life.

TECHNOLOGY MAGAZINE Home Business Education Entertainment Health Life Style Politics Science Sports Technology Home Technology POSSIBLE CHANGES WITH THE iPHONE 8 Technology POSSIBLE CHANGES WITH THE iPHONE 8 By Nicholas Maze - November 13, 2016 Experts in the mobile phone industry have reason to believe that the Apple will return with two new smartphones for 2017. They claim that the phones will have a borderless, curved design. Barclays Research analysts say the new body is because the larger size units. The current size of the iPhones are 4.7 inches and 5.5 inches. The next generation is expected to be 5 inches and 5.8 inches, so Apple will be scraping the bezel design to prevent the phone from being too large. No one knows what actual design will be, but the analysts they have a good chance of being right about the iPhone 8 being bezel-less with a larger display and curved edges. It is believed that the sources were from the supply chain of Apple, and the analysts had returned from a recent trip to Asia. According to MacRumors, the iPhone 8 Plus with a 5.8-inch design, will be the only phone to have an OLED display. The OLED display delivers a brighter and sharper screen, which will also make the display more energy efficient, compared to the standard LCD screen on other smartphones. The OLED displays are currently being supplied by Apple’s competition (Samsun and LG). By 2018, Sharp has plans of being a supplier as well. In March of this year, Ming-Chi Kuo, a KGI Securities analyst, stated that a 5.8-inch version of the iPhone would be released in 2017, with a curved OLED screen and glass casing. Another source also confirmed the enhance design. Robert Scoble, a tech blogger and entrepreneur, mentioned the next generation iPhone having a clear glass case that would possibly be made with Gorilla Glass. Combined with polycarbonates, the glass casing would have much better durability. The glass design will also allow the company to utilize augmented reality technology.

The Gazette Review Home US World Business Entertainment Health Science Sports Technology Home Technology The Next iPads Could Also Be Bringing Big Changes Technology The Next iPads Could Also Be Bringing Big Changes By Sean Farlow - Nov 12, 2016 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter The iPhone 8 is not the only release we could see from Apple soon. The tech giant is rumored to be preparing for the release of a new iPad. But it won’t be just one iPad release, the company is rumored to be working on three new iPads. The latest iPad rumors come from a research note seen by MacRumors. The research note, which is from analysts at Barclays Research, mentions sources talking about three new iPads coming in March. A 9.7-inch, 10.9-inch and 12.9-inch iPads are rumored to be the next releases for the company. Three new iPads would give customers different options but the most interesting part of the rumors seem to be for the 10.9-inch version. The other two iPads are said to be updated versions of the current models but the 10.9-inch version could be released with a bezel-less design. The rumors have also mentioned that the iPad mini 4 will not be receiving an updated version next year. The iPad mini 4 now joins the list of Apple products rumored not to be seeing an updated version in 2017. It was rumored a few days ago that there would be no second iPhone SE next year. The bezel-less design is something that’s been rumored for quite some time now. Rumors have previously mentioned that the iPhone 8 will have a bezel-less design. Apple released the iPhone 7 just a few months ago but the big iPhone changes could come in 2017 as part of the tenth anniversary of the iPhone. Apple has not confirmed this information but the latest rumors are very interesting as they could mean big changes for not just the iPhone but also for the iPad. The iPad, which made its debut in 2010, has seen a number of improvements and changes throughout the years but 2017 could be the year where we see big changes, at least for one of the three rumored versions. It will be very interesting to see what the tech giant announces next year as all of these rumors are giving us an idea on the big changes that their products could have. There have been plenty of iPhone 8 rumors in the past but now it is the iPad that could be changing a few things. What do you think about the latest iPad rumors? Would you buy a bezel-less design iPad? What other changes would you like to see on the next iPad? Let us know in the comments.

By Ritesh Bendre | Published: November 12, 2016 6:46 PM IST Email @GadgetFreak4U comments Tags: Apple News Apple will be celebrating the 10th anniversary of iPhone next year, and it is reportedly planning to launch the next iPhone in three sizes – 4.7-inch, 5-inch and 5.5-inch. However, the next iPhones may not be the only star products as Apple also seems to be gearing up to launch as many as three iPads in March next year. Citing Barclays analysts, Apple Insider reports that the next year’s iPad lineup will include a 9.7-inch and a 12.9-inch iPad Pro model, along with a bezel-less 10.9-inch iPad. All of these iPads will be launched at Apple’s March 2017 event. The report also states that the new 10.9-inch iPad will come in the same enclosure as the existing 9.7-inch iPad Pro, but will omit the side bezels. Barclays also claim that despite carrying the ‘pro’ nomenclature, the 9.7-inch iPad Pro will be a low-cost iPad, and not a premium model. This also means that we may not see the refreshed iPad mini model, at least in early 2017. While details about the specifications and features of the upcoming iPad lineup are unknown, a recent report from KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo did hint at some changes. He mentioned that the next-gen iPads will be powered by Apple’s A10X chipsets made by TSMC and built on 10nm fabrication process. He had also mentioned about ‘revolutionary’ changes to the iPad’s design in 2018, but with the current report of iPad with bezel-less display, it seems like Apple may not wait for another year. ALSO READ: Apple iPad price in India slashed by up to Rs 10,000, storage bumped Based on the reports that we have come across, Apple is likely to ditch the iPhone 7s next year, and would directly release the iPhone 8. Rumors also state that it will come with an edge-to-edge AMOLED display, while eliminating the home button (with Touch ID fingerprint sensor) altogether. With Apple launching the bezel-less iPad in early 2017, it would also offer a sneak peek at how Apple’s iPhone 8 with edge-to-edge display would look like. ALSO READ: Apple iPhone 8 could boast truly wireless charging capabilities Talking about the next-gen iPhone, we recently came across mockups made by Latvian graphic designer and YouTuber Veniamin Geskin, offering us a glimpse at how the iPhone 8 may look like. Apple is expected to give the required resolution bump to the next-gen iPhones – with the 4.7-inch model sporting a full HD panel, whereas the 5.5-inch model finally switching to a QHD (2K) display, just like its competitors. However, details about the display resolution of the 5-inch iPhone aren’t known yet. ALSO READ: Apple patents new technology that will find your lost iPhone even when switched off The new iPhones may also boast a glass back made by Lens Technology and Biel Crystal Manufactory, both factories based in China. The iPhone 4s released back in 2011 was the last Apple device to come with a glass back, after which the company opted for metal housing. The new iPhones may also come with ‘long-distance charging’ technology that will allow users to charge the iPhone from a distance of up to 15 meters. Right now, all these are rumors and leaked reports based on supply chain, but we will have to wait until Apple officially announces these products to see what all features finally make to the devices. ALSO READ: Apple iPhone 8 could come in three sizes and this is how the lineup may look like Mars surface too dry to be habitable: Scientists Gionee S9 teaser reveals front-facing flash, live photos leak too Published: November 12, 2016 6:46 PM IST | Updated: November 12, 2016 6:46 PM IST Mashable Tech Facebook is finally taking a step to combat fake news Tinder launches new trans-inclusive gender options New customizeable book helps girls smash tech stereotypes This book is the perfect gift for every Apple fanboy and fangirl Trending How to watch OnePlus 3T launch live stream at 11:30PM IST Xiaomi Mi Box 4th generation Android set-top box to launch tomorrow; here’s everything we know so far Vivo V5 hands-on and first impressions Gionee S9 with dual-rear camera, 5.5-inch full HD display launched: Price, specifications and features Huawei turned down opportunity to manufacture Google Pixel smartphones; here’s why Related Articles Apple Pay now supports instant donations to non-profit organizations Samsung Galaxy S8 to take on Apple iPhones with new pressure-sensitive display technology: Report Apple working on Google-like augmented reality glasses iPad games are effective in treating amblyopia in children: Study Here’s how the Silicon Valley reacted to Donald Trump being elected as the 45th US President News Online harassment in India lacks awareness, strict laws: Report Reliance Group partners Cisco Jasper for its IoT venture ‘UNLIMIT’ How to watch OnePlus 3T launch live stream at 11:30PM IST Xiaomi Mi Box 4th generation Android set-top box to launch tomorrow; here’s everything we know so far Meizu Pro 7 with 5.62-inch Super AMOLED ‘bezel-less’ display and Kirin 960 SoC leaks online Newsletter Email address: Previous ArticlePreviousGionee S9 teaser reveals front-facing flash, live photos leak too Next ArticleNextMars surface too dry to be habitable: Scientists FOLLOW BGR Like BGR on Facebook Follow @BGR on Twitter BGR on Google Plus Follow BGR on LinkedIn Download BGR App from Play store BGR ON TWITTER BGR India @bgrindia 1h Online harassment in India lacks awareness, strict laws: Report bgr.in/news/online-ha… BGR India @bgrindia 2h Reliance Group partners Cisco Jasper for its IoT venture ‘UNLIMIT’ bgr.in/news/reliance-… BGR India @bgrindia 3h How to watch OnePlus 3T launch live stream at 11:30PM IST bgr.in/news/how-to-wa… About Privacy Policy Contact Us Apple Android BlackBerry Business Exclusives Mobile Reviews Copyright 2016 BGR Media, LLC × Tip Us

Apple's iPhone 8 will feature bezel-free designs and will be available in 5-inch and 5.-8-inch displays, according to  Barclays Research analysts Blayne Curtis, Christopher Hemmelgarn, Thomas O'Malley, and Jerry Zhang. The analysts reported that the iPhone 8 rumors might sport new form factor, ditching the traditional bezel design of earlier models. Advertisement The analysts cited sources with Apple's supply chain following their trip to Asia this week. They were quoted by Mac Rumors saying that "iPhone 8 design didn't sound 100% locked down, but we believe the move is to a bezel-less design with screen sizes getting larger and curved edges in the original envelope. The iPhone 8 moves to 5" (from 4.7") and the Plus moves to 5.8" (from 5.5")." According to the analysts, only the 5.8-inch iPhone 8 model will use OLED display technology, which is more energy efficient than LCD technology.  As reported before, Samsung and LG were tapped to supply OLEDs to Apple for one year, then to be joined by Foxconn-owned Sharp by 2018. This development corroborates the March 2016 report by KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo who said the iPhone 8 would have a curved OLED display and glass casing next year. Japanese website Nikkei described the iPhone 8 as a premium model that is positioned alongside Apple's 4.7-inch and 5-inch iPhones with LCD displays. Advertisement Previous reports revealed that the iPhone 8 would have no Home button. However, this rumor has been downplayed by Barclays. They do not believe that the iPhone 8 will move to an in-screen resolution, but they expect it to "extend vertically and horizontally." For tech blogger and entrepreneur Robert Scoble, the iPhone 8 will have a clear glass case, which will be manufactured by Gorilla Glass, with polycarbonates infused for better durability. Apple's is rumored to incorporate augmented reality technology with the new smartphone.

The screen will reportedly extend edge-to-edge with virtually no bezels perhaps like Xiaomi’s Mi Mix. (Photo : instagram/ _iphone_8 ) Advertisement The only thing Samsung did right in Galaxy Note 7 is making a compact design with a good screen size and at the same time, they added curved edges to make the things look attractive. Now according to rumors, Apple might borrow a page in Samsung's playbook. The iPhone 8 will have a larger screen with curved display, according to a Barclays Research note sent to MackRumors. According to Citing Asian Supply checks and Barclays Research analysts, Apple will switch from the current 4.7 inch iPhone 7 and 5.5 inches 7 plus to larger 5 and 5.8-inch display for the iPhone 8. The iPhone 8 might sport on OLED screen. The screen will reportedly extend edge-to-edge with virtually no bezels, perhaps like Xiaomi's Mi Mix. Apple copying to Samsung seems unlikely, but it's worth nothing the company was granted a patent for curved screens that are similar to Samsung's Galaxy Edge smartphones. The iPhone 8 will have a brand-new glass and metal design reminiscent of the iPhone 4. It also has an iconic home button and embeds the Touch ID sensor underneath the display and possibly Sport wireless charging over a distance. According to rumors, the iPhone 8 will have a faster processing speed with a new iOS version. The other rumors which are far less likely include a ceramic case and Digital Crown with better cameras. If the rumors are true, then the screen size will be larger than that of the iPhone 6, which was released in 2014. It could also include features like biometric additions - iris or facial scanning. The iPhone 8 is still under development and Apple will probably release it next year - the 10th anniversary of the iPhone. © 2016 Enstarz, All rights reserved. Do not reproduce without permission.

Apple‘s last tablet releases included the debut of the large 12.9-inch iPad Pro, followed by a more the more reasonably sized iPad Pro in the 9.7-inch form-factor. But now rumors are buzzing that next year will see refreshed iPad Pros in both those previous sizes, along with a brand-new 10.9-inch model featuring a bezel-free design. This latest information comes from Barclays analysts, which source Apple’s supply chain in Asia. They predict Apple to announce the trio of new iPads at a media event sometime in March. While the release of 12.9-inch and 9.7-inch iPads updated with Apple’s latest processors at some point is obvious, it’s the new 10.9-inch model that’s most interesting. The analysts note that the tablet will eliminate the borders that usually surround the screen, making it an edge-to-edge display. Because of this, the new model will be able to maintain the same physical size as the existing 9.7-inch iPad Pro. iPad Pro 9.7 Review: the laptop killer The remainder of Barclays’ prediction is that Apple will sell the three larger iPad models alongside each other, with the 9.7-inch model becoming the “low-cost” option, despite maintaining the “Pro” name. The 7.9-inch iPad Mini isn’t expected to be refreshed anytime soon, but the existing model, first released in September 2015, will continue to be manufactured and sold. There have been rumors about 10.1 to 10.5-inch iPad for several months now, and reports about next year’s iPhone featuring a bezel-free design for much longer than that. It could be that Apple has been considering a brand-new iPad size/design for some time, and has decided to use it to unveil an edge-to-edge display ahead of the next iPhone.

It has been rumored before that Apple iPhone 8 will represent the company’s major shift in design following what is basically three years of no change. Since the 2014 iPhone 6, the Cupertino Company has lagged behind in terms of innovative designs, but analysts are adamant that this will change at the iPhone’s 10th-anniversary launch event. According to Barclays Research analysts, Apple will be making a huge change in the overall design of both iPhone 8 and 8 Plus. Where the former will come with a 5-inch display size, the latter will also add 0.3 inches of display. In the past, we’ve heard talk of curved edge-to-edge screen designs for the 2017 iPhone and apparently, the same institution has the same in mind. This will still keep the same gap that exists between the 4.7-inch iPhone 7 and 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus – which is 0.8 inches. Samsung has been busy in the Android world with edge-to-edge screens and in fact, it has been rumored that next year’s Galaxy S8 will come with this design on both variants. Xiaomi recently surprised many with an almost bezel-less Mi MIX and if this report is right, we could see a similar device with the 2017 iPhone 8. As part of the design overhaul, Cupertino will get rid of the physical home button and instead integrate the Touch ID into the screen of the phones. Unlike the Xiaomi Mi MIX, this will mean the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus do not feature bottom bezels. The front-facing camera is also expected to somehow find a new home behind the screen, a feature Xiaomi was forced to place on the bottom bezel of the Mi MIX. In short, Apple could be in line to be the first OEM to come in with the first real bezel-less smartphone. Of course, this is not a report you can fully rely on for the upcoming changes to the iPhone 8. However, it’s not the first to speak of these changes with respect to the 2017 flagships. We’ve also heard KGI’s Ming-Chi Kuo speak of an all-glass design featuring AMOLED panels. It is also not the first time talk of a 5-inch screen size has shown up. When the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus came in, it was suggested that the major changes have been spared for the 2017 iPhone 8 and 8 Plus. Perhaps, this is it! There’s still time and we should be seeing more of these rumored changes flooding in. Keep following us!

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Apple iPhone 8 to sport 5.8-inch curved borderless display Apple iPhone 8 to sport 5.8-inch curved borderless display By Bindu Nair - Nov 12, 2016 Image Credit Apple’s next iPhone 8 has been churning the rumor mills for a while now, with many asserting that it’ll sport a revolutionary design to celebrate the fact that it’s the company’s 10th anniversary iPhone. A fresh Barclays Research report now elaborates on what exactly the brand is planning for the handset. The researchers went on a trip to Asia to dig up some dirt on the iPhone 8. People working within Apple’s supply chain apparently told them that the smartphone would be sold in 5-inch and 5.8-inch models with a curved and bezel-less design. However, the report cautions that the look isn’t 100% locked down yet but the general move is indeed towards a borderless style with bigger displays. Interestingly, they also believe that this revamped design will continue to maintain the same overall size as the present 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch models. Also Read: iPhone 8 may feature truly wireless charging technology The note also asserts that only the 5.8-inch iteration will be blessed with OLED technology. Samsung and LG are supposedly Apple’s main OLED suppliers, with Sharp set to enter the fold by 2018. As far as the front panel goes, the analysts don’t expect the brand to move the home button to be moved under the screen. This goes against what past reports have said about the iPhone 8’s home button. Finally, Barclays claims the screen will extend vertically as well as horizontally. It didn’t elaborate on what exactly this could look like. The fresh crop of information neatly falls in line with predictions well-regarded KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo had made about an OLED 5.8-inch iPhone 8 in March 2016. Even the Nikkei Asian Review had said something similar, alleging that Apple plans to launch three new iPhones in 4.7-inch, 5-inch, and 5.5-inch models, with the last being the premium OLED option.

Tags : iOS-iOS+ Apple-Apple+ Apps-Apps+ Apple is rolling out a tech support app in the App StoreNot everyone knows how to use the Apple iPhone in their hand. That is why Apple has launched the new Apple Support app that is now rolling out to the App Store. The app provides tips to iPhone users, including information about different iPhone models, and will even help get you an appointment at the Apple Store for an iPhone repair. Heck, it will even schedule an appointment with an authorized third party repair shop. With the Support app, you can chat, email or speak with an Apple Support technician. The app will know all of the Apple products you have registered, so if you know your phone only as an iPhone, the app will tell you whether it is an Apple iPhone 6 or an Apple iPhone 6s. The app's home screen will list your Apple produced devices, along with links to certain articles that explain how certain features work on your Apple product. So far, the Support app is not yet available in the U.S. App Store. It is available in the Netherlands, and clicking on the sourcelink will take you to the app's preview page. While we don't know when this will be offered in the states, the app will surely come in handy after the holidays when a number of rookie iPhone owners will need help in learning how to use their new handset. source: AppleSupport via TechCrunch Share Tweet Share Bravely Default: Fairy's Effect coming to smartphones in 2017 12 Nov Prev news Facebook testing chat rooms feature for Messenger 12 Nov Next news Close newer posts Vivo V5 specs leak; both V5 and V5 Plus to feature 20MP selfie snapper 13 Nov Previously leaked bordlerless Meizu phone could be the Pro 7 12 Nov Buy the cloud-centric Nextbit Robin for just $169.99 from Amazon 12 Nov Facebook testing chat rooms feature for Messenger 12 Nov Now reading: Apple Support app starts rolling out to the App Store Apple Support app starts rolling out to the App Store 12 Nov Bravely Default: Fairy's Effect coming to smartphones in 2017 12 Nov Huawei P10 specs revealed by a GFXBench benchmark test? 12 Nov Dell Stack Windows 10 phablet looks gorgeous in leaked render 12 Nov T-Mobile soon to launch the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge in Blue Coral? 12 Nov Microsoft's canceled Nokia Moonraker smartwatch shown in hands-on video 12 Nov older posts Featured stories   Samsung Galaxy S8/S8 edge a.k.a.

TechRepublic Apple is doubling down on open source Apple has been getting religion on open source, but more than code the industry needs its voice. By Matt Asay | November 9, 2016, 10:07 AM PST Image: CNET Apple may be the most secretive tech company on the planet, but it's finally starting to open up to open source. While the company has yet to issue its own open source report card, Google style, an Apple software engineer recently noted "at Apple we are doubling down on open source." That's progress, and follows on the heels of the company acknowledging its use of Apache Mesos, as well as updating its open source page to proclaim, "Open source software is at the heart of Apple platforms and developer tools." Is it enough? SEE: Job description: iOS developer (Tech Pro Research) Open is as open does Most of Apple's software isn't open source, of course. From Siri to iOS, Apple keeps most of its code under proprietary lock and key. That's partly legacy, but it's also simply in keeping with how most companies operate, including big open source contributors like Google or Twitter. More about Open Source Open source is not to blame for a lack of industry standards Why Red Hat's OpenShift, not OpenStack, is making waves with developers Subscribe to TechRepublic's Open Source Weekly newsletter Some of this has to do with trying to maintain competitive differentiation, but much of it comes down to effort: It's real, extra work to open source code. Lately, Apple has been warming to more visible involvement in open source projects. Though the company has long used open source software within its proprietary products, it is now starting to contribute back, hosting projects on GitHub and on its own (like Swift). As such, it's impressive to hear Apple's Michael Kjellman open up on Apple's open source ambitions: [A]t Apple we are doubling down on open source. We have tons of code in flight -- really big ones in fact -- many already out for review. Our list of enhancements we want to do grows all the time so there is no shortage of work to do. Some of that "work to do," as Red Hat's Jason Brooks calls out, could involve less draconian software licensing agreements. However, it's hard to find particular fault in Apple's SLAs, given that SLAs across the industry basically translate to "This software doesn't work and will almost certainly blow up at any moment." Apple's aren't any worse. It's more than code The cynic will argue that Apple is only getting into open source because it has to. In a world fueled by developers, enterprises must speak their language: open source code. As Klint Flinley put it, "[E]ven Apple can only risk alienating the developers on whom it relies for so many third-party apps and services so far. Coders have myriad options available to let them do their jobs the way they want; to keep them in-house, it turns out, Apple has to open up." Finley was referring to Apple's now open source programming language, Swift, but it's true across the board with Apple technology. Apple has proved adept at getting developers to build for its ecosystem (e.g., the App Store), but it will need tighter ties to the developer crowd as it seeks to improve services like Siri that gain resonance as developers extend them (similar to how Amazon's Echo keeps getting better due to third-party integrations). SEE: Apple's Swift programming language: The smart person's guide (TechRepublic) Which brings up a final point: As great as it is that "Apple continues to contribute and release significant quantities of open source code," it's even more important that the company contribute in other ways. As Wes McKinney writes of GitHub, it "overemphasizes the value of commits over the other kinds of important contributions to open source projects, like doing code reviews and discussing bugs and new features on the issue tracker." For me, the most important thing Apple can do is talk about how it uses open source. Apple's taking the stage to talk about Apache Mesos and Siri, for example, is just the sort of thing to lower barriers to entry for less technical enterprises. Developers want to hear from other developers, and the fact that Apple is finally starting to participate in public conversations about open source is a huge step for Apple...and open source.

For those buyers looking for something a little less ubiquitous than the standard aluminium Watch there’s the stainless steel version. Or a version with a posh Hermès strap. Or even the ceramic Apple Watch Edition. But what if you’re the energetic type and want your Apple Watch to better reflect that? That’s where the Apple Watch Nike+ comes in. In terms of specification this is identical to the standard Apple Watch Series 2, but it does get a couple of Nike-flavoured exclusives in the form of faces and straps. There’s also the new version of the Nike+ Run Club app that, while not actually exclusive to the Nike version of the Watch, is featured as part of the setup, which makes it well worth a look here. How much extra does the dedicated Nike nerd need to fork out for these little tweaks? Absolutely nothing - it costs no more than the entry-level Series 2. The question is whether it’s a free upgrade or a variant to be avoided… Apple Watch Nike+ design: strapped for sport Easily the most striking and most successful element of the Apple Watch Nike+ is its exclusive strap, referred to as the Nike Sport Band. Essentially, this is the standard Sport Band with a load of holes punched through it, which I realise doesn’t exactly sound revolutionary, but the result is a strap that’s even lighter and more comfortable than the already very comfortable standard design. It’s just that little bit stretchier and more flexible, and that means you can wear it just a little bit tighter - that can be a big help for accurate heart rate measurements. If you’d prefer your Apple Watch Nike+ to look a little more subtle than the version I’ve got here, there are three other variants of the strap available. The grey/green version is still fairly attention-grabbing, but the grey/white and black/grey versions both blend in a lot better. And, of course, if you fancy a change at some point you can simply buy a new strap from Apple or a third-party manufacturer, and quickly swap it in. Apple Watch Nike+ exclusive faces As with every version of the Apple Watch, the strap you choose is just the start of the customisation options available to you. At this point there are loads of different watch faces available, and the Nike+ edition of the Watch gets some that aren’t available on any other version. The exclusive options essentially boil down to three basic designs - one digital and two analogue, but each one of those can be customised further by switching between white or Nike Volt (bright green) for many of the elements, and by swapping out the complications. Complications, for the uninitiated, are the little icons dotted around many Apple Watch faces. They’re designed to work as shortcuts to certain apps and in many cases deliver at-a-glance information. The digital Nike+ face, for example, has a column of three round icons to the left of the digital clock that by default represent the Nike+ Run Club app (more detail on which below), the calendar and weather, and a wide badge at the bottom that acts as a shortcut to start a run. These are all complications, and as you can see from the picture above, I’ve swapped some of them so that Apple’s activity rings and my Watch’s battery level are always displayed. The only thing you can’t do is remove the Nike tick, which is the shortcut to the Nike+ Run Club app. Well, you’ve got to expect that really, haven’t you? Even with that concession, I have to say that I’ve found the Nike+ Digital face to be one of the most readable around, so it’s well worth trying out even if you’re not a Nike super-fan. Apple Watch Nike+: the Nike+ Run Club app As mentioned above, the Nike+ Run Club app is not exclusive to the Nike+ version of the Apple Watch, but it has been freshly updated to coincide with the launch of the hardware and you are encouraged to install it as part of the setup process, so it’s worth taking a look at in a bit more detail here. First up (and it’s an obvious one) - Nike+ Run Club is a running app. Unlike Apple’s own Workouts it’s entirely dedicated to pounding pavements and treadmills. It does, however, share one of Workouts’ best features, in that it can utilise the Apple Watch Series 2’s built-in GPS chip so that you can record your runs without the help of your phone. For many people this is a big deal of a feature, and one that other popular fitness apps - such as Strava and Map My Run - don’t yet offer. It’s also a very simple app, and that’s absolutely intentional - the idea is that it gets you started on a run as quickly as possible. Open the app and you’re immediately presented by a big green button labelled ‘Start’. Tap that and you’re given a 3, 2, 1 countdown before your run begins. Too many taps for you? Just say “Hey, Siri, let’s run” into a Nike+ Watch and that countdown begins immediately. Best make sure you’re ready to go. It’s also probably best if you’ve selected the ‘Advanced’ mode before you set off as well, as the default mode only has readouts for distance and time. Even the most undemanding of runners are likely to want to check on their pace and heart rate during a jog, and these are only enabled in Advanced mode. Even then the BPM is a bit small for quick glances and the pace seems a little erratic while you're on the move, but seeing as they don’t make the rest of the info harder to read I’d recommend adding them in. There seem to be a couple of issues in the post-run performance of the app, too. At the time of writing it’s about 24 hours since my last 5km run, and every time I try to check the stats of the run using the Activity tab in the iPhone app I find there are some pieces of info missing, and each time those missing pieces seem to swicth around. At first there were no figures for BPM or elevation, then when I checked back I had an elevation figure but pace was missing. At no point have I logged in to find a full suite of stats. In other words, the new version of the Nike+ Run Club app seems to be pretty buggy right now. That’s not to say there aren’t some good things about the Nike+ Run Club app. Its biggest success is how it motivates you to keep running and keep improving. Just under that big, green Start button on the Watch is a smaller, not green ‘match it’ button, which immediately starts a run that targets the distance or duration of your last run. Or you can swipe right from the main Start screen to get to a page that asks ‘when are we running?’ and offers a list of time slots complete with little icons representing the expected weather at that time. It’s a great way to check for the best time to run and to mentally commit yourself to getting out there and getting on with it. Then there’s the community aspect of the Nike+ Run Club phone app, which offers not only feeds and leaderboards for your friends and the community at large, but also allows you to register for free, paced club runs organised by Nike. Admittedly these club runs are limited to a few cities across the world, but if you’re a Londoner or someone looking for a fun social run while visiting a city abroad (some include a bit of sightseeing, apparently) these are a really neat little added extra. It’s these extra features that make it such a shame that the Nike+ Run Club app has launched with those niggling bugs. Once those have been squashed, though, this should be a very simple, motivating alternative to Apple Workouts that’s especially good for beginners or casual joggers. But remember, you don’t need the Nike+ Apple Watch to get the Run Club app, so it shouldn’t really have an effect on which version of the Apple Watch you buy. Apple Watch Nike+: the verdict You’ll notice I’ve not gone into the general details of the Apple Watch Series 2, and that’s because I’ve already written a pretty exhaustive review of that, which you can check out here: Apple Watch Series 2 review Want the short version? I think the Apple Watch Series 2 is a brilliant device, and the first wearable to really successfully bridge the gap between sports watch and smartwatch. But should you buy the standard edition or the Nike+ version? Seeing as the price is the same, I’d say that if you’re planning on getting all sporty with the Apple Watch the Nike+ version is the one to get, even if you’re not specifically a Nike fan. The exclusive faces are good but not terribly exciting, and the Nike+ Run Club app is available to all Apple Watches. The strap, though, is a real winner. Lighter, more breathable and more flexible, it’s simply more comfortable when working out, regardless of the sport. It’s a fairly minor improvement, for sure, but it’s a minor improvement that costs you no extra money. Now that’s the kind of maths we can all get behind. Stuff says...  Apple Watch Nike+ reviewThat sporty strap makes the Nike+ version of the Apple Watch the one to buy if you're the energetic type from US$369 Good Stuff  Lighter, stretchier, more flexible strap is great for sport Exclusive faces will appeal to Nike fans The same, brilliant Apple Watch Series 2 underneath Costs no extra than the standard version Bad Stuff  Nike+ Run Club not yet up to full speed Liked that?

Argyll Free Press Growing News Network Tuesday, November 15, 2016 Log in Business Finance Sports Tech & Science Travel Headlines Health United States Apple Launched iBooks StoryTime for Children November 12, 2016 By Deborah Campbell Leave a Comment Apple TV has a new reading app for kids available called iBooks StoryTime. Apple on Thursday has launched a new Apple TV application called iBooks StoryTime. It brings children’s books to the big screen. Kids can go through the pages of various books on their own, or even switch on Read-Aloud narration. The feature will sync the audio to the on-screen text and change pages for you. The app is free to download and works on the 4th generation Apple TV devices that have access to tvOS App Store. However, the books are not free. There’s a giveaway at launch so you can test the app and its functions. The available content is a Read-Aloud book titled Dora’s Big Buddy Race Read-Along. A wide variety of books are available to purchase from the StoryTime app itself, as well as on the iBookstore on Mac, iPad, and iPhone. All compatible content that has been purchased previously will be available in the iBooks StoryTime. Despite the app’s great functionality for kids, it does not have a lot of supported titles at the moment. The available books include certain classic titles like “The Little Red Hen,” “Goodnight Moon,” and “Green Eggs and Ham,” and more. Several popular characters such as Grover, Sophia the First and Cookie Monster are also present in various titles, among others. In case you’re wondering if the content is appropriate for the age of your child, then it’s important to know that the app is aimed at preschoolers that have started to learn how to read. The app deviates from the standard reading apps currently available on mobile and tablets by using the Apple TV. It offers a great balance and educational experience to the hours spent by kids in front of the TV for entertainment purposes. Reading apps can be useful but also inefficient in captivating a child’s attention. The digital medium allows them to easily switch to other, more entertaining apps. This is one reason why physical books for children won’t be replaced anytime soon. Other companies have also started to thinking about more innovative ways to attract and maintain a child’s attention. Amazon’s Rapids reading app builds on how already kids use messaging apps to chat with their friends and family. As such, it uses an interactive messaging-like interface to tell a story.

Well, if you are a frequent visitor to the Apple store, then this new app that the company is now launching will be a life saver for you. Yes, this is none other than a dedicated Apple support app for iOS which you can install on your iPhones, iPads, and iPods. But it’s not here yet. First of all, let’s just see what this application is capable of doing. The Apple Support App requires iOS 9.0 or later and it will allow users to quickly go through some troubleshooting articles for your preferred device or allow you chat with a technician from within the app or maybe if you have an issue which cannot be resolved via the app itself, then it can also schedule an appointment with a nearby Apple Store or Apple-sanctioned service provider. This application is personalized to each and every individual user and it will know all the Apple hardware that you have registered with your account. Hence don’t worry if you don’t know which model of MacBook you own or which iPhone you are using. It will show you the content only for your devices based on the data it collected. And as far as the interface is concerned, there also you won’t have any issue since it looks like it has an easy to use interface. On the home screen, all your products are listed and according to the same, all the relevant articles will also show up for your needs. Well, if you have been following the news, then by now you already know that the recently launched Pixel smartphones from Google come with a 24*7 online support system. And interestingly, you don’t have to go anywhere to solve your issues. All you have to do is, go the support option and select the type of support you want and you are good to go. It is definitely something new and interesting to have on board and gives a sense of confidence while using the device since you know that there is a support team out there. And now talking about the Apple Support App again, as mentioned earlier, there is a catch to this and you cannot start using this just yet. As of now at the time of writing this article, the application is only showing up in the Netherlands App Store. We have no confirmation as to when should we be expecting this app to hit our app stores and other different regions. However, it is good to know that they are working on something like this to ease out the efforts. You can check out the Support App here and if you own and an iOS device outside Netherlands, then keep checking your app store as it might be launched anytime. Stay tuned.

January 2, 2015 Apple now says Watch ‘coming early 2015’ for several European countries on its website, matching US release window (updated) Benjamin Mayo - 2 years ago @bzamayo Apple Watch AAPL Company iOS Devices iOS 2015 Comments (30) Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit   Update: Apple has reverted all of these changes listed below. Aside from the US site, the respective pages for all other regions now say that Apple Watch will be ‘Available in 2015’ again. The change to early 2015 seems to have been a mistake. Apple’s online pages for Apple Watch have today been updated with a slightly narrower timeframe for several European countries. Previously, whilst the US site stated ‘Coming Early 2015’, localized pages in the UK and other regions were less concrete, simply stating that Apple Watch would be ‘Available in 2015’. This has now changed for several European countries, including the UK, France, Spain, Germany and Italy. Leave a note in the comments if you catch any more affected countries. The change means that these region-specific pages now mirror the US pages (after translation) with the ‘Early 2015’ timeframe. It is still possible the Watch will see a staggered release, but at least the rollout is now confirmed to be relatively tighter. The latest rumors indicated that the Apple Watch will be launched in the US by Valentines Day, in February. It is not inconceivable to imagine a situation where the device launches exclusively in the US in February, followed by a wider European rollout in March, for instance. This would easily qualify as an ‘early 2015’ launch. It is also possible that the Watch launch in multiple regions simultaneously. Official news about the launch dates should come out soon, if indeed the Watch is coming out in the US in February.

If they were wanting to get it out before Valentine’s, there’s no way they would cut it that close to the day.

For activity tracking including sleep, the Watch didn’t do better than my Polar Loop. Yet, its sheer beauty by itself in terms of design felt good to wear. Until exactly one week into use, a dead spot appeared onscreen, and immediately (within the hour) I sent it in for assessment. Apple refused to replace the OLED and had their third party service centre ask me to buy a replacement watch. Imagine if I had an Edition instead of Steel! If one has failed like that, why replace with another? It seems, they say, the fault was caused by ‘hard pressure to the screen’. Odd. I’ve used every iPhone and iPhad iteration, the MBPwRD2012 and brand new MacBook 2015… and never have I hard pressed any of these contact surfaces. Now, I’m stranded minus Watch and feeling very annoyed at the accusations. This in spote of Singapore’s new 2014 consumer protection laws similar to Australia and the UK, and I feel very disappointed with how they want to do business with early adopters and brand loyal users. That is a genuine let down. LikeLike Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate. Please view our tips policy or see all contact options.

Apple To Launch 3 iPads In March 2017 International Business Times 3 days ago Corazon Victorino © Provided by IBT US Apple could be holding a March 2017 event for the launch of three new iPad models. If the statements of Barclays analysts are to be believed, the Cupertino giant could be unveiling two new iPad Pro devices and a new iPad that will mark the start of a new series.  AppleInsider reported Friday that the iPads that Apple could be launching early next year are new iterations of the 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro tablets. In addition, Samsung’s biggest rival is also rumored to introduce to the market a bezel-less 10.9-inch iPad.   Per Barclays analysts, the 10.9-inch iPad is going to sport the same encolsure size as the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, but it will not have bezels on either side of its display. It is believed that the 10.9-inch model is going to mark the start of the new series of Apple tablets. Popular Searches Apple Inc AAPL ▲ 106.53 +0.82 +0.78% Microsoft Corp MSFT ▲ 58.85 +0.73 +1.26% Bank of America Corporation BAC ▼ 19.96 -0.13 -0.62% Cisco Systems Inc CSCO ▲ 31.74 +0.37 +1.18% Meanwhile, the upcoming 12.9-inch iPad Pro is expected to launch with the new True Tone display that’s already part of the current 9.7-inch iPad Pro. On the other hand, the new iteration of the 9.7-inch model is going to be the “low cost” tablet among the three, though it is part of the “Pro” series. This is because the device will be sold alongside the iPad Mini.  Consumers should not expect that the 9.7-inch iPad Pro to debut with premium specs. According to PhoneArena, it is very likely that the smallest tablet among the upcoming three would be manufactured with entry-level specs only. Apple is reportedly planning to lure customers who want a more affordable iOS-running tablet with this iteration. Though no pricing details are available as of late, the new 9.7-inch iPad Pro could sell for a little more than the iPad Mini.  Per GSM Arena, since Apple is not planning to refresh the iPad Mini this year, it’s possible for a new model for the Mini line to arrive next year. This is contrary to reports that surfaced in August saying that Apple could be phasing out its 7.9-inch iPad Mini line because it failed to attract a lot of customers ever since the Plus line of the iPhone was launched.

January 29 AAPL: 97.34 3.25 How-To: Automate weight logging w/ the Health app using Siri, Workflow, or a smart scale Greg Barbosa - 10 months ago @gregbarbosa iPad Apple Watch iPhone iOS Devices Apps Comments (11) Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit When news came out that Apple was working on a dedicated Health dashboard app, which would offer a way to take healthcare monitoring mobile, I was extremely excited. I had been recently diagnosed with traumatic arthritis in my knees and I needed a better all-in-one system to track my steps, weight, and BMI. None of the other apps on the market at the time seemed to do any one of those three especially well. Apple’s Health app has since become my go-to app for everything I wanted to log and more. It’s not perfect, but it’s a built-in dashboard with tie-ins to plenty of iOS apps. Within a few weeks of using Health, I soon realized I wanted a better way to automate inputting data into the system. I eventually came to a methodology that worked great for me and decided it was time to share three of the different ways you can automate quickly logging your weight into the Health app. Workflow Before I decided to make the plunge into purchasing a smart scale, I knew I wanted to start taking advantage of automating my weight tracking immediately. Many of the other apps that existed out there made the steps to get in and actually log weight just too cumbersome and complicated for what I really needed. This is where Workflow delivered for me. Workflow (currently $2.99), released a little over a year ago, is an Automator-like tool for iOS. You’re are able to combine different actions together to create something akin to small apps, a workflow. When Workflow was first released, I knew I would be able to use this to log my weight without having to rely on an expensive smart scale. If you’d like to get started using the workflow I created, open this link on your iPhone after installing Workflow. For this particular workflow, I only needed two actions: ‘Ask for Input’ and ‘Log Health Sample’. Once they were added in, I then changed the workflow’s settings so that it was set to a ‘Today Widget‘ and ‘Apple Watch‘ workflow. From there, every morning I would wake up, walk to my basic bathroom scale (an older version of the Sunbeam Easy Read Dial scale), and then log my weight directly from Notification Center or my Apple Watch. Siri Want a less robust but free automation solution? A bit of a hidden feature of Siri in iOS 9 is the ability to be reminded of whatever is currently in context in any given supported app. For example, I could be looking at an iMessage thread, activate Siri, and say “Remind me about this in 15 minutes.” It would then create the reminder for me as expected, but it also includes a direct link back to that Messages thread. This becomes especially useful for remembering to actually log your weight. The biggest problem I had at the start of my whole weight-logging experiment was that I frequently forgot to log it every morning. The more data you log, the more interesting trends will be. To mitigate this, I opened the weight section under the Health app and told Siri “Remind me of this every day at 8:30 AM”. Now when the reminder comes in the morning, I can just launch directly into the Health app from the reminder and input my weight in the correct section. For those that have configured weight-logging using the Workflow app from above, using Siri here is also a great way to bring it one step closer to full automation since you can build them both together. Smart Scale After nearly a year of logging my weight using a mix of these automation methods, I eventually decided it was time to upgrade this process and get a smart scale. I wanted to get a more precise read-out of my weight changes than just relying on a basic scale. Apple has listed the Withings Smart Body Analyzer under its health accessories for the a long time, and with good reason too. Although our primary focus is on weight logging, the Withings scale includes a cornucopia of other features including air quality monitoring and heart rate measurements. The most attractive part of this scale for me was the fact that it also supported logging multiple family members, up to eight different users. It’s a great way to get the whole family more aware of their health in general. Another popular alternative smart scale is the Fitbit Aria which has the advantage of integrating directly into the Fitbit ecosystem, while the Withings solution speaks to Apple’s Health app using HealthKit. Using the power of Workflow, Siri, and a smart scale, it becomes extremely easy to start recording health data and monitoring what it means for your well-being. With all these methods mixed together, I am now logging three major health points. With the smart scale I log my weight and BMI, and with Siri and Workflow, I am logging my caffeine and water intake as well. How are you using the Health app in your day-to-day life? What tools and accessories are you using to make logging the data more useful? I’m always looking for new ideas, so let us know in the comments below! Workflow is available for $2.99 in the App Store and is compatible with iPhones, iPads, and the Apple Watch (Health is only available on the iPod touch and iPhone). The Withings Smart Body Analyzer is available now for $99.99 in black or $149.99 in white, and the Fitbit Aria is available for $119. For those looking for just a basic (non-smart) scale take a look at the Etekcity Digital Body Weight Bathroom scale ($18.48), the BalanceFrom High Accuracy Premium Digital Bathroom Scale ($18.95), or the EatSmart Precision Digital Bathroom Scale ($24.95).

David Q - 10 months ago Reply I have the Withings scale and have found that my weight doesn’t register in the Heslth app until I open the Withings app on my phone first. Withings can automatically send my weight to MyFitnessPal without opening the app but not Apple Health. Wish there was a way to automate that because that’s the only reason I ever have to open the Withings app at all. LikeLike 3rdngoal - 10 months ago Reply I think you have to give the App permission to communicate with the Health.app. Have you done that? Open up Health,app and go under Sources. You should see options under each source to enable or disable. LikeLike David Q - 10 months ago Thank you. I think I figured out the problem. For some reason, Withings was not listed as the first source for recording wright data (it was third behind the Health app and Apple Watch). I moved it to first and will try again once I get home later today. LikeLike Corneliu Harea (@charea) - 10 months ago I do not have Withings listed in App permissions, anyone know why? I have the 6s. LikeLike Eyal Yeruham - 10 months ago Withings doesn’t show up as a source in Health. The only way to sync your weight is via MyFitnessPal – but then you will have to open that app for it to sync your weight from Withings and then to Health. Also it’s a shame, since all the other information goes unnoticed by Health since only your weight syncs. This means that BMI and heart rate doesn’t sync.. LikeLike Zombi Teks - 10 months ago Reply pretty dope, I like the fitbit myself. LikeLike Eyal Yeruham - 10 months ago Reply Somewhat related: does anyone else have the issue that an app that used to sync data to Health and was deleted from the phone doesn’t get fully removed from the list of App permissions within the Health app? LikeLike scottweidig - 10 months ago Reply @David you need to have the Withings HealthMate app installed on your device. That is what gives and gets the permissions for the Withings Smart Scale. I have oned one for about a year new and it is great. LikeLike k0jeg - 10 months ago Reply I’ve been using the Wahoo Fitness scale for a few months now. The reviews were mixed, with many people reporting inaccurate weight over repeated weigh-ins, even a few minutes apart. I guess I got one of the good ones, because mine is very consistent (sometimes frustratingly so!). It does tend to eat batteries. What I’d like to see is a stand-alone app (no need to log in and create a separate account like MyFitnessPal and the other “free” apps) that will track calorie intake as well. Preferably with a BT enabled food scale. Just pick the food from a list, put it on the scale and go. That way I could close the loop, because I know I’m not tracking all the calories as accurately as possible, even when I keep notes.

Called iBooks StoryTime, the app, available for free on the App Store, displays interactive books on the TV screen with the Read-Aloud feature, as well as lets pages be flipped with the Siri Remote’s touch pad. Read-Aloud features narration for the books, along with displaying subtitles on-screen to read along to. For supported books, things like sound effects and highlighted words are shown, and multiple character voices are used. When this mode is enabled, pages will automatically turn as the narration progresses. There’s also the option to turn Read-Aloud off, allowing pages to be turned with a swipe on the remote. This is designed to be used when a parent reads to a child themselves, or the child wants to practice reading themselves. “iBooks StoryTime gives your family a different way to experience classic kids’ books and discover new favorites. With Read-Aloud narration and beautiful illustrations, every handpicked title in the app transforms the Apple TV.” Among the supported Read-Along titles are Green Eggs and Ham, The ABCs of Cookies, The Little Red Hen, Goodnight Moon, Meet Tracker, Big Brother Daniel, and Chicka Chicka ABC. These can be purchased from iBooks on any iOS device, and they’ll automatically sync to the Apple TV. The iBooks StoryTime app also comes with Dora’s Big Buddy Race Read-Along Storybook for free, so Apple TV users can give it a try before buying anything.

However, only the iPhone 8 Plus will be fitted with an OLED display. Pictured is the newly released iPhone 7.  ( Sean Gallup | Getty Images ) Advertisement Industry experts report that Apple might have two new smartphones lined up for next year, both of which will feature curved, borderless designs. Analysts from Barclays Research said the tech company is looking to discard the traditional bezel design for its upcoming 5-inch and 5.8-inch iPhone units in order to make them as small as its current 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch offerings. While the design for the iPhone 8 hasn't been confirmed yet, the analysts believe that it could feature a bezel-less look with curved edges and a larger display compared with the original design. The new iPhone could move from 4.7 inches to 5 inches and its Plus version could move from 5.5 inches to 5.8 inches. These details reportedly came from sources within Apple's own supply chain while the analysts were on a recent trip to Asia. Rumored iPhone 8 Design According to MacRumors, the Barclays researchers added that the rumored 5.8-inch iPhone will be the only one to feature an OLED display, giving it a sharper and brighter screen. This will also allow the new handset to have a more energy efficient display compared with other smartphones with LCD screens. So far, Apple receives its supplies of OLED displays from rival smartphone makers LG and Samsung. Sharp is also slated to become a supplier by 2018. The latest iPhone 8 rumor supports earlier statements made by KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. In March, Kuo said that Apple will release a 5.8-inch version of its flagship iPhone with glass casing and curved OLED screen in 2017. Tech blogger and entrepreneur Robert Scoble said the iPhone 8 will have a clear glass case, which could be made from Gorilla Glass combined with polycarbonates for better durability. This clear glass look will allow Apple to incorporate augmented reality technology with the new smartphone. "You pop it into a headset which has eye sensors on it, which enables the next iPhone to have a higher apparent frame rate and polygon count than a PC with a Nvidia 1080 card in it," Scoble pointed out. Meanwhile, Japanese news website Nikkei reported that the upcoming iPhone will have a considerably larger display. This premium model will be featured alongside the company's 4.7-inch and 5-inch handsets that have LCD screens. As far as other possible designs for the iPhone 8 go, Barclays said it doesn't believe that the new smartphone will have its Home button embedded beneath its display, contrary to earlier rumors. The research firms said it is more likely that the upcoming handset will share a few design similarities with Xiaomi's Mi Mix, which features a slight bezel located at the bottom of the unit.

If the statements of Barclays analysts are to be believed, the Cupertino giant could be unveiling two new iPad Pro devices and a new iPad that will mark the start of a new series.  AppleInsider reported Friday that the iPads that Apple could be launching early next year are new iterations of the 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro tablets. In addition, Samsung’s biggest rival is also rumored to introduce to the market a bezel-less 10.9-inch iPad.  Per Barclays analysts, the 10.9-inch iPad is going to sport the same encolsure size as the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, but it will not have bezels on either side of its display. It is believed that the 10.9-inch model is going to mark the start of the new series of Apple tablets.

Apple TV tvOS Has A New Update For Developers Meanwhile, the upcoming 12.9-inch iPad Pro is expected to launch with the new True Tone display that’s already part of the current 9.7-inch iPad Pro. On the other hand, the new iteration of the 9.7-inch model is going to be the “low cost” tablet among the three, though it is part of the “Pro” series. This is because the device will be sold alongside the iPad Mini.  Consumers should not expect that the 9.7-inch iPad Pro to debut with premium specs. According to PhoneArena, it is very likely that the smallest tablet among the upcoming three would be manufactured with entry-level specs only. Apple is reportedly planning to lure customers who want a more affordable iOS-running tablet with this iteration. Though no pricing details are available as of late, the new 9.7-inch iPad Pro could sell for a little more than the iPad Mini.  Per GSM Arena, since Apple is not planning to refresh the iPad Mini this year, it’s possible for a new model for the Mini line to arrive next year. This is contrary to reports that surfaced in August saying that Apple could be phasing out its 7.9-inch iPad Mini line because it failed to attract a lot of customers ever since the Plus line of the iPhone was launched.  Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

November 12 AAPL: 108.43 0.64 First MacBook Pro with Touch Bar orders ship, deliver as soon as Monday Benjamin Mayo - 3 days ago @bzamayo MacBook Pro View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Apple has now started shipping the first new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar orders with the delivery notifications indicating that the laptops will arrive in people’s hands as soon as Monday, November 14. Several 9to5Mac readers and others online report receiving shipping notifications from Apple and or UPS, as pictured above and below. All shipped orders we’ve seen so far are for 15-inch MacBook Pro models. Shipment alerts for the 13-inch units will likely follow soon. Apple originally offered an estimated shipping timeframe of 2-3 weeks with the new MacBook Pro models that first went up for preorder on October 27 following the company’s unveiling. However, this quickly slipped to 4-5 weeks as customers snatched up the first major design revision to the MacBook Pro in four years. The Apple Store is still reporting 4-5 week delivery times for new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar orders. Here’s another 15-inch customer receiving shipment confirmation by UPS; often the courier beats Apple to posting the Shipped notifications on the tracking website. @9to5mac my shipping notification that came in today for a first day order 15" MBP estimates delivery of Monday pic.twitter.com/dfRqSr3ZBp — Andrew Rose (@andrewrose_) November 12, 2016 So far, we are yet to receive confirmation of shipments for 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar or non built-to-order 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar models. However, we expect all SKUs to be shipping shortly with deliveries across the week. @9to5mac @reneritchie received shipping notification for the MacBook Pro this morning. pic.twitter.com/12TADqri5l — Justin L. Fowler (@justinlfowler) November 12, 2016 At its October event, Apple relaunched the MacBook Pro line with three new laptops, a cheaper $1499 13-inch laptop and two new MacBook Pro with the new Touch Bar. The former model has been available for some time but the focus is on the ‘revolutionary’ Touch Bar equipped machines. Instead of physical function keys, the Touch Bar MacBook Pros feature a multitouch OLED screen where the function row usually resides on the keyboard. This enables Apple to offer dynamic buttons, sliders and contextual widgets relevant to the app the user is currently interacting with on the primary display. We’ve walked through how this works in Apple’s apps already and third-party developers have also started announcing integration with their apps. My MacBook Pro shipped. pic.twitter.com/38WUOVabBY — Aaron Zollo (@Zollotech) November 12, 2016 All new MacBook Pro’s feature upgraded CPU and GPU options, 100% faster SSD read and write speeds, USB-C Thunderbolt 3 ports, a larger trackpad and improved speaker system housed in a 20% thinner and smaller chassis enclosure. However, the new Pros have not been accepted by the community with open arms, far from it. The products have caused several controversies in the last few weeks. Most notably, Apple has removed all legacy IO (such as traditional USB-A ports, SD card reader and a HDMI port) in favour of Thunderbolt 3 USB-C ports. The 13-inch MacBook Pro has two USB-C ports and the 15-inch model has four. Although the port is much more flexible than what it replaces, some people were upset with the transition as it means customers need to buy an array of dongles, adaptors and new cables in order to connect their new laptop with existing accessories. In response, Apple is holding a temporary sale of USB-C accessories on its website through the end of the year. Apple has also been criticised for the lack of a 32 GB RAM option (Apple cited battery efficiency concerns) and the general price increases seen with the Touch Bar machines. The new 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar starts from $1799; the 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar starts from $2399. In terms of buyer response, though, the new laptops are appear to be selling well. Apple announced that the new MacBook Pros set a record for online Apple Store sales and a third-party analytics firm said the new MacBooks bested the rest of the industry in just 5 days.

Like what its name suggests, the app is designed to provide support to users through tips and informative articles.  TechCrunch reports that the Cupertino giant’s new app contains a mixture of product information, useful tips and a feature that would enable users to schedule repair appointments at an Apple Store or any authorized third-party shop.  The Apple Support app is designed for both the iPhone and the iPad. However, owners of these devices should know that the app is only compatible with iOS 9.0 and iOS 10. Also, Apple appears to be slowly rolling out this app, since it is only found on the App Store for the Netherlands as of press time.  Based on the official description of the app, it is a “personalized guide” for users of Apple devices. It is said to contain articles that are tailored to answer questions of users about the product they own. Per GSM Arena, the articles the app contains are “How To” reading materials.  Related Stories DoorDash iOS App Now Lets You Order Lunch Through iMessage Group Chat PayPal Debuts Siri Integration In Latest Update Apple Releases Minor iOS 10.1.1 Update The app also comes with a feature that allows users to chat or email an Apple Support technician. If this two are not enough for the user, he or she can make a call to schedule an appointment with a technician.  The screenshot of the app on the App Store for the Netherlands shows that it lists the products a user owns. The list is not limited to the iPhone and iPad only, since a MacBook could also be seen in the screenshot. Moreover, there’s an option that states “Get help with other products,” so the app could also have information about Apple’s other products aside from its smartphones, tablets and MacBooks. Apple Support app screenshot Photo: The Netherlands App Store   According to Engadget, reports about a standalone Apple support app have been circulating the web since last year, but it is only this week that the rumored app is materialized. The tech site also stated that it has reached out to Apple for details about the availability of the app in other countries, but the Cupertino giant has yet to respond.  Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

This Time, it’s the Apple iPhone 7 Plus Another Day, Another Smartphone Explosion! This Time, it’s the Apple iPhone 7 Plus Smartphone explosions have become a rage in recent times. Now, a person in China claims that his Apple iPhone 7 Plus exploded after supposedly dropping from two feet. By: Chakri Kudikala Published: Saturday, November 12, 2016, 16:35 [IST] Smartphone explosions are really pushing the users backwards. After the great Samsung Galaxy Note 7 debacle all these days, we are hit with yet another explosion coming from China. This time, it's not a Samsung device, but the South Korean giant's rival, Apple's iPhone 7 Plus. This news is coming all the way from China as a man accidentally loses control over his new iPhone 7 Plus and the outcome was really horrible. Instead of a cracked screen or dents on the phone, the device exploded horribly. SEE ALSO: Facebook's Messenger Rooms Feature Allow Public Group Chats Similar to Yahoo Chat Rooms Having said that, the phone was dropped just from two feet, which makes the incident even worst. Not so long ago, in Australia, an iPhone 7 exploded and Apple is still investigating that event. And this event makes things even worst for the Cupertino giant. SEE ALSO: Millions Declared Dead on Facebook Including Founder Mark Zuckerberg It's interesting to see how Apple will consider this incident. Thankfully, there was no harm to the owner of the smartphone. The major dent in the smartphone world was the recall Galaxy Note 7, which shook the entire industry. All said, the major issue for all these explosions is the smartphone's batteries.

Barclays forecasts, citing sources from the supply chain, that the iPhone 8 will come with curved screens that will use 5.0-inch and 5.8-inch panels, which means that Apple will increase the size of the iPhone from the existing 4.7- and 5.5-inch models. The iPhone 8 will also adopt a new design, with Apple planning to offer a phone with no bezels, the analyst says. While there’s no confirmation of such a thing, this isn’t the first time we’re hearing about such a plan, with Apple also believed to be working on integrating all front-facing parts into the screen. All-in on the display The company holds patents that allow it to include the FaceTime camera into the display and the removal of the physical Home button from the iPhone 7 is also believed to be a step forward towards the integration into the screen on the next model. If this is true, then Apple could remove the bottom part of the iPhone and go for a bezel-less approach that would put the screen at the center of the whole design. Furthermore, with such a look, the iPhone 8 could have approximately the same dimensions as the existing iPhones, as Apple would only increase the size of the display, but reduce the bezels, obtaining a better screen-to-body ratio. There are also reports that the iPhone 8 could be made entirely of glass and feature an AMOLED display and this is also very likely given the fact that Apple has already discussed such plans with several manufacturers. Keep in mind that all these details are still in the rumor stage for the time being and it’s better to take them with a healthy pinch of salt. The iPhone 8 is projected to launch in the fall of 2017, so quite a lot can change in the meantime, but either way, expect it to be a dramatic overhaul of the existing models. #Apple#iPhone#iPhone 8#iPhone 7 subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news More Evidence Shows iPhone 8 Could Feature Revolutionary Wireless Charging Father Says iPhone Nearly Caught Fire in His Daughter’s Pocket Trump Edition Gold-Plated iPhone 7 Up for Grabs for $3,000 iPhone 7 Plus Reportedly Explodes After Accidental Drop Apple Insider Says iPhone 6 Plus Has a Major Bug, Company Should Start Recall Hackers Steal FIFA Currency, Buy Houses and Expensive Cars with the Money WhatsApp Announces Video Calling Rolling Out to Android, iOS Users Microsoft Announces Black Friday 2016 Deals: Perfect Time to Go Windows 10 KDE Frameworks 5.28.0 Released with Numerous KWayland Improvements, More NVIDIA Makes Available GeForce Graphics Driver 375.86 - Get It Now Microsoft CEO Meets Chinese Official One Day After Warning on Trump Tax Plan Apple Downplays Microsoft Surface, Says Having Touch on a Desktop Is a Disaster    iPhone 7 in matte black new ios apps NeuroNation: Train your brain to improve your memory and focus with NeuroNation Flipagram: Create cool videos by mixing up your photos with music Timer+: Set up dozens of timers and control them all with ease Nutshell Camera: Create some pretty cool videos with Nutshell Camera IKEA Catalogue: Check out the IKEA Catalogue for more than just furniture Complete: Complete puts a social twist to your regular to-do list/ task manager WebMD Baby: WebMD Baby offers help in how to best tend to your baby Reader comments Pregnant Woman Suffers Second-Degree Burns After Falling Asleep on iPhone 7 more on: Apple i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

Apple currently plans to wrap up construction by late 2016, so it’s possible the company could move into the new 2.8 million sq ft location starting sometime in early 2017. Apple has been providing sporadic updates on progress on the site, but we have a more comprehensive timeline below that we’ll update as we follow along with Apple’s progress on the under-construction Campus 2 facility in Cupertino.

Hospital stocks are one, with the prospect of Obamacare being unwound. Tech is another. Most of the biggies lost ground, in part because of the things President-elect Donald Trump has said about some of the tech sectors' biggest names — Apple CEO Tim Cook and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos among them. But they also lost ground in part because of what Donald Rumsfeld would call unknown unknowns — the incoming administration's tech policies. We talked with senior tech correspondent Molly Wood about tech policies under a Trump administration.  So what do we know about President-elect Trump's proposed policies for the tech industry? We know next to nothing. In fact, the plan for the first 100 days that is up on the Trump campaign website says nothing about technology. I think there's one line about technical education in a section about schools. The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, which is a non-partisan think tank, have done their best to try to cobble together what might be a bit of tech policy, and mostly, to be honest, it centers around how the business policies might affect the tech industry, specifically around lowering taxes and, of course, immigration policy, and as for the rest of it, it's anybody's guess.   What will happen to the H-1B visas that many tech companies use to hire skilled workers from outside the U.S.? Silicon Valley is extremely concerned about the H-1B visa program. And Donald Trump has said that it is an excuse for people in the valley to hire outside workers and not American workers. But he has not, and is very unlikely, to implement any sort of corresponding funding for technical education in this country, STEM education. He maintains that we graduate more than enough people in fields of technology that should be able to fill those jobs.  Where does innovation in the tech industry go when we literally don't know what the Trump administration's tech policy will be?  I think you could argue that it's an opportunity to innovate around that uncertainty, or to try to set an agenda to get in his ear quickly, and convince him, for one thing, that these issues are important. I think that what Silicon Valley's really worried about is that this has been a really vibrant sector of our economy, and that technology touches every single part of every other business. It is integral to conversations about globalization, to conversations about job growth, because so many of the jobs that the Trump administration is talking about trying to create or bring home are jobs that have been or will very soon be automated. So I think that it's an opportunity for Silicon Valley, if it can stop the freak out, to say, "How can we help shape this agenda in a positive way? Because that's what we do."

It wasn’t long after the original 12-inch MacBook landed that we began our love-hate relationship with USB-C. It was universal, which is great, but without the lineup of our favorite ports on the MacBook, many started to consider life a dongled hell. With the new MacBooks Pro, Apple did its best to change all of that, and its famed reality distortion field helped assuage much of our contempt for USB-C. Pay close attention, and you’ll notice that the term USB-C was muttered only once during Apple’s MacBook unveiling. Phil Schiller said it, and it was only in reference to the connector’s for-factor. Instead, Apple turned the term ‘USB-C’ into ‘Thunderbolt 3,’ which is much more alluring and magical. We tend to think of Thunderbolt as a high-end data transfer port capable of ungodly things — mostly because it’s really that good. With Thunderbolt 3, we’re getting even more good stuff. 40Gbps data transfer is insane, even though it commands a special (expensive!) cable to get there. Apple’s own website leaves USB-C out of the mix, except to discuss the port’s form-factor. Instead, those connection points on a MacBook are now Thunderbolt. Seeing the trend? Reality distortion. A touch of genius. This isn’t a new strategy, and to be fair — Apple’s not wrong, or lying. The ports are Thunderbolt 3 capable inlets; we’re talking distortion, not lies. Apple has done this before, too. The original Thunderbolt ports used the same connection type as Mini DisplayPort, but we didn’t really call them that. Like the new Pros, the former had Thunderbolt ports. But we didn’t have such vitriol surrounding Mini DisplayPort, and it wasn’t in use on smartphones or peripherals. Nobody was calling for Apple to make it universal across mobile and desktop. But Thunderbolt — that’s desktop-class, and a technology many equate to Apple anyway. And once again, Apple is spinning things to make them palatable to a wider audience. If we stop thinking of it as USB-C, and stop calling it USB-C — it’s Thunderbolt. Then it’s special. It’s Apple. And then we stop complaining, and start paying a premium for accessories and dongles because we’ve conditioned ourselves to. Suddenly, and perhaps without even realizing it, everything about the future Apple has pushed us into with these new USB-C Thunderbolt 3 ports seems very normal.

Macs & Mac OS X | 04 Nov 2016 | Listen  | Print  | Comment (28) Responding to Complaints, Apple Drops Adapter and Monitor Prices by Josh Centers Many Apple fans have been irked by how the new line of MacBook Pro laptops offers only Thunderbolt 3 ports (which are backward compatible with USB-C). To connect to existing peripherals, users will require one or more adapters, such as those for USB-A, DisplayPort, HDMI, Ethernet, and even older implementations of Thunderbolt. See “Explaining Thunderbolt 3, USB-C, and Everything In Between” (3 November 2016) for a thorough explanation. Apple doesn’t get any points for thinking ahead, but happily, the company does appear to be responding to the waves of criticism. According to the Loop, Apple is dropping prices on many of its adapters through the end of 2016. Affected products include: USB-C to USB Adapter: from $19 to $9 Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter: from $49 to $29 USB-C to Lightning Cable (1m): from $25 to $19 USB-C to Lightning Cable (2m): from $35 to $29 USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter: from $69 to $49 USB-C VGA Multiport Adapter: from $69 to $49 Apple is also discounting other USB-C products sold in the company’s online store, such as the SanDisk Extreme Pro SD UHS-II Card USB-C Reader, which drops from $49 to $29. If you purchased any of these adapters in the past 14 days — Apple’s return window — the company may automatically credit you for the difference in price; Adam Engst got email from Apple about that after the initial publication of this article. If you don’t hear from Apple in a few days, I recommend calling them and asking for a partial refund. I did that and obtained a $30 refund for my USB-C to USB Adapter and my Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter. MacRumors reports that Apple has also cut the price of the LG UltraFine 5K Display, which it developed with LG, from $1299 to $974 until the end of 2016. Also, Apple slashed the price of the LG UltraFine 4K Display from $699 to $524. The 5K Display isn’t yet available for sale but should launch in December 2016. Apple could have avoided the entire hullaballoo by including an adapter or two in the box with new MacBook Pros or giving customers the option to receive the adapter of their choice for free when ordering. Instead, Apple came off as trying to nickel-and-dime its most eager customers, who were already spending significant sums on the company’s latest gear. And even still, dropping the prices only through the end of 2016 seems stingy, given that Apple’s adapters and cables are almost always the most expensive by far.   READERS LIKE YOU!

As it stands if you buy a laptop and a Magic Mouse you have to pay another $9 just to be able to charge it. I also wish they had a MagSafe to TB3 adapter, as the MagSafes weren't cheap and still work well. Maybe someone else will be able to pull that off with a shallow rough port that it could stay plugged in. Reply dbrugger   2016-11-04 21:27 Quite frankly, Apple has stopped being Apple for the last two machine re-dos, dropping things and adding things as if they were Microsoft software. Waiting for a new laptop, I feel betrayed and that Apple is changing for the sake of changing without any very real innovation. I'm on the search for old refurbished models that have what I want and need. Too bad! Reply Simon   2016-11-05 04:12 Unfortunately I have to agree. As sad as it is. Reply Reinard Schmitz   2016-11-05 05:15 Yep. Sadly I've to agree. Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc  2016-11-08 21:01 Me too. Apple long since lost sight of their customers. In my book the trend began with OS X Lion, which bleached the color, and thus much of the utility (ease of use) out of the Finder window side bar. They only made the problem worse with OS X 10.10 Yosemite, when even more color, depth and usability bled away from the UI. A year from now most the noise over the Thunderbolt 3 ports will have subsided as people adapt to the change. The expense of that adaptation, however, will not be forgotten and it is likely to drive up sales of used Macs. I recently got a good price on eBay for a unibody MacBook Pro, a line which, not coincidentally, is still user serviceable. I replaced the HDD with a comparably sized SSD for about $150 - and it connects to all my gear. As for using adaptors, well, I got used to that problem while servicing MacBook Airs and 11" MacBook Pros, all of which have been short on ports from their inception. I've got Thunderbolt to this and that in my gadget bag. Now I'll have to add TB 3 to this and that. I'm just glad they didn't limit the number of ports any more radically than they did with the new MacBook Pros. Given the precedent set by the MacBook, it could have been worse. Of course, Apple thinks everything can and should be done in the cloud now. But the cloud, particularly iCloud, is far from reliable and even less secure. But, hey, Apple couldn't care less how their imperfect solutions affect actual users. It's their policy and they're sticking with it. Longterm my biggest concern for Apple is their unwillingness to develop a touch-screen PC. Because to do so, of course, would be to admit that Microsoft had a better idea. As far as technology trends go, this is a big one and Apple is ignoring it. Sure, a touch-screen Mac, particularly a laptop, would cut into iPad sales. But touch-screen Windows PCs are going to be shading Apple big time going forward. Adding a few bells and whistles, like the Touch Bar, to the MacBook Pro will not make up the difference. Microsoft ads for the Surface Pro may be obnoxious, but they are on point nonetheless. Touch-screen PCs are not a fad, like Netbooks, that Apple can safely dismiss. They are the future, a future in which Apple is unwilling to participate. And now that Microsoft has introduced their touch-screen desktop computer, the Surface Studio, with a hinge mount that declines to emulate a drawing table (like a Wacom Cintiq), with a Surface Pen and Surface Dial, a high resolution 28" screen that matches the color gamut of the Cintiq, it won't be long before graphics professionals begin to look beyond their iMacs. As it is now you can use a Cintiq with your iMac if you're got room on your desk for the setup, but the Surface Studio will have a much smaller footprint, combining the utility of a capable computer with a large, adjustable, graphics tablet—at half the price. Certainly things aren't going to change overnight, but to my mind the writing is on the wall. Apple's executives are far to insular, cut off from the every day working world of their users. Who would have thought, a decade ago, that Microsoft would be leading Apple in innovation? Reply Simon   2016-11-09 05:20 I'm actually very happy they are refusing to do a touch-screen Mac. One of Steve's strongest suits was recognizing what not to do and knowing when to stay simple. Apple's stance on this issue would have been the same under Steve and I'm very happy about that. No matter how many shiny ads MS puts out and no matter how much consumers think everything has to converge up to the point where your car is also your fridge. Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc  2016-11-09 05:03 Glib remarks about cars and fridges don't enhance your argument. It's not about what consumers think, it's about what they buy. If they don't buy Macs, Apple is in trouble. QED. As for what Steve would like or what he would do, he didn't like the idea of a small iPad or a big iPhone, but Apple is selling them both now. He didn't like dabbling in the enterprise, but Apple is working with IBM and Cisco to expand their footprint in business. Supposing that Steve would like what you like is, well, supply your own synonym for foolish. Personally, I don't need or want a touch-screen computer. But what I want is less than insignificant. Nonetheless, I see the market moving to touch-screen PCs and Apple missing the boat. We're not talking fads here. As I mentioned, Apple made a small iPad when the market favored small tablets and they made large iPhones when the market was going that way. And they are moving into the enterprise to expand their role in business. Ultimately, whether or not to make a touch-screen Mac should be a rational business decision, not one guided by pride, vanity or sentiment. As for simplicity, there's nothing simple about using two devices to do the work of one. Nor is there anything simple about Apple's multi-device, multi-OS market strategy these days. What, pray tell, is simple about iCloud? What's simple about all those Apple apps in your dock? Simplicity is a them trotted out when it suits Apple's purposes and ignored when it does not. It's a red herring—at best. There's nothing simple about Apple. Reply Simon   2016-11-09 05:29 Pride or vanity has nothing to do with it at all. Bottom line is macOS has been heavily optimized for mouse/KB. It would need substantial changes to make it touch friendly. I want Apple to focus that energy on making sure it remains the best OS for mouse/KB. I don't want them to focus on adding something solely because supposedly many consumers are interested in that. Many consumers are also interested in Windows or McD. So what? Ignoring that crowd is not a problem as long as you remain more interested in product quality than in market share. Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc  2016-11-09 13:17 I see. It's all about what you want. Thanks for the heads up. Reply dave nuss   2016-11-04 21:47 Hi! I've seen this price reduction mentioned on several sites today but not mentioned and no email from Apple about those of us that forked over for new MBPs and dongles in the first minutes after the Hello Again... Do we get automagic refunds? ... I see Adam called and got some refund so I went to Apple Chat and after some time got the same. Sad they didn't just automatically apply the credits, but I guess that's how they build up that cash pile. Thanks for reporting this! Reply Adam Engst   2016-11-05 11:55 Josh was the one who called, but we also ordered an adapter last week, but I just got email from Apple saying they were refunding me automatically. I'll add that to the article. Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc  2016-11-08 19:25 Of course not. They're not going to give away money. If you snooze, you lose. Reply Michel Hedley  2016-11-05 02:34 These expensive Apple connectors are not well designed. They are prone to breaking at the plug end. For all of Apple's prowess in design, Apple can't seem to design peripherals that are fit for purpose and make them rugged enough for every day use. Reply Simon   2016-11-05 04:34 I'm really surprised by this move. Apple used to be very good at anticipating customer reaction. Now they come out a few days after the big launch and essentially declare they got the pricing all wrong. Has their marketing been taken over by a bunch of clowns? What have these guys been doing for the past months? Josh is absolutely right in his final paragraph. They could have handled this so much better. When did Apple become so bad at this game? Reply James  2016-11-06 10:31 They haven't admitted the pricing is wrong. They have TEMPORARILY lowered the price in the hopes that people shut the hell up about it and get it out of the mainstream news. Same goes with the 5K Display. How convenient. They've lowered the price on items that you can't even use for another 3 to 5 weeks. By the time the MBPro actually ships, the price on these adapters and the 5K Display will go back up. Reply Simon   2016-11-05 04:35 So what can be inferred form this surprising move? Only days ago their propagandists were trying to spread this claim that early order numbers had been awesome like never before. Had the uptake indeed been that astronomical, would Apple leadership be willing to give up one cent of profit from all these de facto required adapters? A guess would be orders are either low or they're worried they won't be selling enough new MBPs with all the bad press they're getting - much of which is related to the many dongles required and their ludicrous pricing. Reply Simon   2016-11-05 04:32 It's also interesting to see they were forced to do this in connection with the new MacBook Pro. This is the segment where there are a lot of pro users. People using their Macs for actual work, where productivity counts. People who are knowledgable about performance and technlology. People you can't just sway by releasing a fancy feel good campaign celebrating a new pink or gold color. It seems they're a bit drunk with their success in selling expensive status symbols to teenagers in China. I'm surprised they obviously didn't realize they cannot sell to the pro crowd like they do to those people. Reply George Wade  2016-11-05 12:12 OTOH – foreseeing the problem requires a certain amount of guesswork; while just going ahead with delivery of the product results in marketplace demand for what is actually needed in the way of adapters, accessories and cables. Do we demand that Apple use Artificial Intelligence to get a better match ! Reply Adam Engst   2016-11-06 10:36 Determining that people would be unhappy about not being able to use any existing peripherals without buying extra dongles doesn't take an advanced degree. :-) Reply Scott M.   2016-11-08 03:05 Especially considering they did realize that people were going to be pissed about the lack of a headphone jack on the iPhone 7 and thus smartly included an adapter in the box with the iPhone 7 rather than nickel and diming people by forcing them to buy that adapter. I supposed, however, that it could be argued that Apple had advanced warning since the idea of Apple killing the headphone jack had been "leaked" for at least a year before the iPhone 7 was released. Thus, Apple could not avoid hearing all the people complaining about the killing of the headphone jack before they actually did it. There was no such "advanced warning" for the all USB-C fiasco for Apple, at least as far as I can tell (I don't watch all the Apple rumors and such like you might...I only saw one article that suggested it might be possible, but not that it was really a leak). One would think, however, that there is one senior/high level executive (any lower level drone likely would be ignored/steamrolled) that should have been able to put two coherent thoughts together to extrapolate that there might be a similar reaction to having to buy a "dongle" in order to use a run of the mill USB device with their new top of the line "Pro" laptop as there was to the idea of buy a "dongle" to use with their expensive headphones for a new iPhone. But, then maybe I am expecting too much of Apple senior executives these days. And their "sale" on "dongles" does not help their image too much in my opinion. As someone else said, it kind of smacks of "here, have a discount...now we hope everyone will forget about it and we can go back to nickel and diming you". To me, the smart thing would have to just give all purchasers of new MacBook Pros (with the USB-C ports) at least 1 free USB-C to USB-A "dongle" with their order. Either just add it to the order for free automatically or included it in the box (after all, most of the new MBPs have not shipped yet). And for anyone who already got it, just ship them a free one (or refund them the full price if they ordered one). After all, while not every one needs Ethernet or used an external monitor or needs a Firewire "dongle", etc, I would argue that the vast majority of people at least use a flash drive or external drive or even use a USB printer. So, I would expect the vast majority of people make use of at least one USB-A device on a regular basis. Of all the "miscues" that I believe they made with the new MBPs, this was the most unforgivable. And I even put this above Jony Ive's infatuation with form over function and his incessant need to make all Apple devices thinner just for that sake of making them thinner and sexier (I will stop there before I get my "rant on"). Reply Dennis B. Swaney  2016-11-07 19:56 Those dongles are still excessively overpriced: none should cost more than $4.99 which would still give Apple several 100s percent profit. Reply Brian S   2016-11-07 20:22 I'm curious why Apple dropped the monitor prices. It doesn't appear related to the dongle fiasco. Reply Steve L'Heureux  2016-11-07 20:53 I have to say I feel Apple is entirely out of touch with it's older users. I'm 60 and have been with them since 1989. With as much as they charge for their gear, to keep Nickle and Diming us after they keep changing ports year after year is Fu**king pissing me off. I'm disgusted. I'm steering my clients to buy the older refurbs right now. Is it time for Phil Schiller to retire? Who the hell is driving the Apple Bus right now anyway??!! I have to think Steve J would be turning over in his grave right now. Geez, Apple is now even ceding control to Graphics creation to Microsoft with it's Surface Pro!! WTF??!! Who the hell is minding the Store??! Mr. Cook, are you paying attention????? Reply Curtis Wilcox   2016-11-08 17:34 What do you mean, changing ports year-after-year? Before USB-C, what was the last change to a Mac connector? I think it was MagSafe 2 replacing MagSafe and that was four years ago, not that recently. That's also when MBPs dropped built-in Ethernet, which I do miss (I don't miss the optical drive). Replacing USB 2 with USB 3, no downside. Replacing Thunderbolt with Thunderbolt 2, no downside. Replacing Mini DisplayPort with Thunderbolt, no downside. Roughly eight years ago, Mini DisplayPort replaced all their other video connectors, pretty much guaranteeing you'd need a dongle to connect to an external display (until they added HDMI to MBPs). But it also cleared out the mish-mash of different connectors on different models; they had DVI, Mini-DVI, and Micro-DVI on different laptop models all in the same time frame! Mini DisplayPort didn't eliminate "dongle hell" but it did make it more sane. Steve Jobs is the one who dropped all preceding connectors in favor of USB (for which there was not much adoption yet) and floppy drives on the original iMac, his is not a name to invoke when criticizing the forward-looking decision to go all-in on Thunderbolt 3/USB-C. Reply Openreels   2016-11-07 23:23 Nothing new here, Apple's been changing interfaces on us for decades! At least when they introduced TBolt as THE ONE interface they also had a display with breakouts built in. Unfortunately it took quite some time for 3rd parties to bring out alternatives that were badly needed. That could happen again, but at least USB-C has big potential for the long-term (assuming anyone can understand it). Guess I don't need to keep the old ADC video adapter cable any longer, or that crazy non-standard power cord... Reply dbrugger   2016-11-08 13:31 Price reductions don't make it. Put back what you took off so I don't need the adaptors. Then Apple will have made it right. Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc  2016-11-09 15:28 The price of dongles is probably a side show for Apple. And, though I was surprised by the port configuration of the new MacBook Pro, I think there is method to their madness. They no longer have to worry about which ports to include in their ever slimming laptops. The simple fact is that Thunderbolt 3/USB-C will serve every currently popular port, from video through USB to Thunderbolt, FireWire and Ethernet—and memory card readers. Not only that, you can charge external devices or the Mac itself from any of the ports, though I suspect there are some unspoken caveats on that score. With the right adaptor (or hub) you can connect any legacy tech you own. That's quite a coup when you step back and think about it for a minute (or two). The MacBook Pro is now essentially universal. It means the customer doesn't have to worry about which model has which ports. Get a Mac and customize it as you like, with the adaptors for the ports you need. It's a new and rather shocking concept. But it will make sense in the long run. That said, as Josh suggested, Apple could have handled things better. Clearly the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing. But that's nothing new in Apple's security obsessed, vertical silo organization. In fact, it's the norm and is't only surprising when they don't muck something up. Does anyone remember how OS X 10.10 Yosemite did a face plant right out the door? Meanwhile, if they had included an adaptor with the new Macs it would inevitably have been the wrong adaptor for some people. The new meme is about you choosing the adaptors you need. A credit toward an adaptor purchase at the Apple Store might have been nice, but it would almost certainly have been too much for some people and not enough for others. I suspect consternation over the new port alignment was factored into Apple's sales projections. Though I suspect many people enthusiastically ordering a new MBP didn't realize what they were getting into. Apple undoubtedly expected flack over some of their decisions. And just as undoubtedly they expect such flack to subside as people get used to the new reality—as they always do when Apple changes things up. And they expect (or hope) that the luster and charm of the Touch Bar will balance things out a bit. But there are a lot of other questions to be answered. Almost lost in all the hoopla over ports and adaptors is the larger size and Force Touch capability of the MacBook Pro trackpad. That, too, will take some getting used to. It's too soon to tell if the new keyboard, not including the Touch Bar, will be a plus or a minus. The keyboard on the MacBook was not all that well received. Is this one like that one? And, frankly, the Apple Wireless keyboard on which I'm typing this comment is the best Mac keyboard I've ever used—and I've used them all at one time or another. It's comparable to the keyboard on most Mac laptops up till now. Then there's touch ID. Does that mean you cannot start the new MBP with a password? At least on an iPhone you have a choice in how to set it up. And just how good are those new speakers? Does it matter? We won't know till we hear them. Will the 16GB limitation on RAM be an issue? Some people think so. How can you have a "pro" computer these days with only 16GB of RAM?. This was probably a matter of heat dissipation, though there are two new low profile, supposedly quiet fans to cool thing down. There are some cool videos about the MacBook Pro on the Apple web site, http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/, along with some rah-rah explanations of all the new features, of which there are many. I think spending some time studying what Apple has to say about its new Mac will calm the jitters some people are having about it. It did so for me. Oh, and speaking of new features, taken in toto this is more than the usual evolutionary upgrade of the MacBook Pro. The RAM is faster, the system bus is faster, the CPU is faster, the NVRAM is faster, the SSD is faster. The screen is brighter with a higher gamut (color range) and better contrast. The speakers are more robust. The ports are more powerful and versatile. The Touch Bar is almost revolutionary. In other words, Apple waited until they could upgrade literally everything on the MBP. For a change they lived up to Steve's old motto: Apple will introduce no technology before its time. Let's hope this proves to be true in this case. I can't wait to try one out at my local Best Buy—especially the keyboard, which is a make or break item in my book. And, lo, I've almost reached the character limit on this post. Whoa. Reply Scott M.   2016-11-09 16:38 While I have issues with aspects the whole "dongle" thing, I do agree that the USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports are powerful and overall a good thing. Personally, I don't particularly object to "dongles". It does allow for rather flexible and powerful ports that can then be adapted to how users want/need to use them. And I don't really care that "dongles" are ugly. I am totally in the "function over form" (not that I don't appreciate a nice design). Where I do have an issue is that Apple screwed up how they handled it and the plain reality is that it might cost them some sales. In many ways, Apple could predict which "dongles" people might want or need, so there certainly are challenges to the idea of Apple providing some "dongles" in the box. I would argue that is true for most "dongle" options, but not true for at least one simple USB-C to USB-A (i.e. currently available "standard" USB port). Like a headphone jack on an iPhone, I would argue that the vast majority of MacBook Pro use on a rather regular basis a USB device. So, to me, Apple's true screw up on the "dongle" front was not including at least 1 USB-C to USB-A "dongle" with every new MacBook Pro purchase (and I would argue MacBook purchase). After all, with Apple's "here have a discount for a short period of time on these dongles sale, at least until you forget that we screwed this up" sale on "dongles", it would appear that it costs Apple $9 or less to make the USB-C to USB-A dongle (I highly doubt Apple would be will to sell them at a loss even for distraction/marketing sales in the hopes of dying down the controversy until people forget about it). So, Apple's mistake was not just eating the $9 (or less) cost of providing at least 1 USB-C to USB-A dongle with the sale of a MacBook Pro (like they did with the Lightning to headphone jack dongle with the iPhone 7). I also agree there are other aspects of the new MacBook Pro to like, but some that are still unknown (in particular the TouchBar...hard to say how useful it will really be until actually using it) and some that are not so good (such as the limit of 16 GB of RAM). I, however, will not be watching any of Apple's marketing videos. While I love Macs and will generally pick them over a Windows machines the majority of the time (except for certain situations such as a gaming computer), I can only take so much of the Apple marketing koolaid crap of "magical this" and "magical that". In the end, they are still just marketing videos that come from a very biased source (which is true of pretty much all marketing material). To that effect, I have not watched the MacBook Pro keynote and not sure if I will. I did watch the iPhone 7 event and was left rather unimpressed by the presentation. That is not to say that there were some nice upgrades/improvements to the iPhone 7 and other potentially nice new products (such as potentially the AirPods when they are finally released). What left me disappointed was essentially a 2 hour presentation that did not present enough new and innovative stuff to deserve a 2 hour presentation. It came across too much as a self-congradulatory marathon of "magic this" and "magic that"...AND most of it was not magic in my opinion. In the end, I just think that Apple has let itself get trapped in a self-absorbed and self-congradulatory bubble. Yes, they make excellent products that I prefer to use...most of the time...but they have gotten too caught up in their own marketing hype too often. But that is just me.

Shoppers will be hoping for dramatic discounts across a wide range of items, most notably consumer tech and electronics including laptops, televisions and gaming consoles. In terms of what will be up for sales, previous generations models often see the most dramatic discounts, and this year we're expecting deals on Macbooks, iMacs, iPhones, iPads, Apple watches and Apple TVs. Apple products rarely ever undergo price reductions, with people resigned to paying full price for the highly sought-after tech. Last year, the company didn't participate in the mayhem so their staff weren't expected to work such hectic long hours. Therefore, the trick to finding Apple Black Friday deals is knowing where to look — and that's anywhere but the Apple Store. Read More When is Black Friday 2016? Deals predictions, stores to watch and shopping tips ahead of the huge November blow out Which retailer's should I stalk? Major players like Curry's and Amazon should be your first port of call. Likewise Argos, John Lewis, eBay and laptop specialists like LaptopsDirect are also worth browsing during Black Friday. If you're after a cheap Apple phone head to Carphone Warehouse. Many retailers will drip feed deals so keep your eyes peeled - Apple products will be snapped up fast. Current Apple deals We will be updating this page will deals as they're announced so check back for the latest news and offers. Read More Apple deals MacBook Pro iPad Mini MacBook Air iPads Top Black Friday 2016 Apple deals - Ironically, don't expect any Black Friday deals to appear at the actual Apple Store. Other retailers such as John Lewis and Currys will have the best (and only) discounts on Apple products. - Previous generation iPhones are expected to be heavily discounted due to the release of the iPhone 7. Make sure you look at the amount of memory in the iPhone 6s. - After an Apple Watch? Pay attention to whether its the original or the Series 1 as the former has a slower processor (which shops are unlikely to note). - For the best iPad discounts, we suggest investigating deals for the iPad Air 2. Shopping for tech: Dos and Don'ts Whilst we can predict that there are going to be lots of amazing tech deals to be had on Black Friday, it's worth pointing out that not everything will be the good deal that it sounds. So Vouchercloud compiled a list of tips for buying tech this Black Friday: 1. Focus your efforts Create a list of tech items you need or want and don’t stray from it! Big brands often offer package deals on Black Friday and whilst it seems like a good investment at the time, you might be stuck with added extras you'll never use! This will also mean you’re less likely to overspend. 2. Set a budget and stick to it We all know how easy it is to get carried away with spending when it comes to buying the latest gadgets and gizmos. It doesn't matter if you’re buying a Fitbit, iPhone or home entertainment system, set yourself a clear and defined budget... And stick to it! It’s easy to think that spending an extra £50 won’t matter too much but it can all add up if you break the budget on a number of items - remember Christmas is just around the corner! 3. Do your research Most brands will start to announce their discounts before they go live on Black Friday, so try and take a look online or in store before the date and consider the products you’re interested in buying. Always look around for voucher codes on sites such as vouchercloud.com and HotDeals.com and extra discounts before buying a product online too. 4. Use tech to buy tech There is no shame in using your existing tech items to buy more tech - we’ve all done it! You can use your existing phone or tablet to download branded apps such as Amazon as they will have will have dedicated Black Friday tech landing pages so you can scan through deals quickly on the day. 5. Check if the product is the latest version Many of the ‘deals’ you’ll see on Black Friday are a previous gen or they may be poorer quality products that the retailer wants to clear from their stores! It doesn’t mean they’re not worth the investment, but it’s worth checking the specification against recent devices just in case. 6. Deals last the whole weekend Panic normally sets in and most people will try and purchase all of their tech goods on the Friday, but remember that deals will nearly always last the whole weekend. It’s also worth considering that whilst Black Friday and Cyber Monday are huge events in the retail calendar, there are other sales events throughout the year such as Amazon Prime Day. If you don’t get your tech bargain on the Friday - it might be reduced further later in the year. 7. Pay securely If you’re shopping online for tech items, be sure to use a credit card or Paypal. If you do use a credit card, use one that offers you rewards such as air miles or vouchers for money off your shopping to save even further. Looking for something specific? If you're dreaming of an Apple iPad, or want to replace your laptop with an Apple MacBook, now is your chance. Bag yourself some cheap Apple goods this November 25th a.k.a Black Friday.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 11, 2016 at 9:22PM Over on Seeking Alpha, contributor Black Coral Research recently argued that were Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to transition away from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) processors in its Mac line of computers, contract chip manufacturer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) would be a big winner. Apple MacBook Pro computers. Image source: Apple.  "TSMC is benefiting from the halo effect of solid iPhone 7 sales, but its real potential is when Apple decides to design its own silicon for its Mac," the contributor writes. "We estimate that TSMC could generate $5.5 billion in annual revenues from such a venture, leading to 20% revenue and earnings growth." This analysis doesn't stand up to scrutiny. Here's why. The current Mac supplier doesn't even generate that much The biggest problem with this analysis is that it assumes that TSMC will be able to charge Apple a whopping $300 per chip for Apple-designed Mac processors. This is absurd, because this would imply that TSMC would make significantly more from building each Apple-designed Mac processor than current Mac processor provider Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) makes on average from the chips it sells Apple. A quick way to "prove" this assertion is as follows: Apple ships roughly 20 million Mac computers each year, give or take a few million. If Intel sold processors to Apple at an average of $300 apiece, then Intel would generate roughly $6 billion per year in revenue from Apple. Per Intel's form 10-K filings for 2013, 2014, and 2015, Apple wasn't responsible for at least 10% of Intel's revenues in those years. In those years, Intel's revenue was solidly south of $60 billion, so we know that Apple pays much less than $300 for Intel processors on average. Further, even if Intel did take in that much per chip from Apple, Apple's per-unit costs would be lower for Apple-designed chips manufactured by a third party, since the third party isn't getting paid for the chip design. The iPhone opportunity is much larger than the Mac opportunity The Seeking Alpha post suggests that TSMC would have a bigger opportunity to profit from Apple's building an in-house Mac processor than it does from having a monopoly on the iPhone 7 A-series processor business -- as well as the A8, A8X, and A9X chips that currently power the iPad. That doesn't make sense. In Apple's last fiscal year, it shipped nearly 212 million iPhones and 45.59 million iPads. It shipped just 18.484 million Macs in that period. In terms of chip area, and therefore chip dollar content to TSMC, an Intel processor isn't much larger than a high-end iPhone or iPad processor. The A10 Fusion measures in at 125 square millimeters in TSMC's 16-nanometer process; the A9X comes in at 147 square millimeters. These are already large, high-silicon and thus high-dollar content chips to TSMC. Even if we assume Intel's average content across Apple's Mac lineup is twice that found in an iPad processor, TSMC's winning the Apple business over from Intel would amount to the addition of roughly 36 million iPad processors' worth of revenue. In TSMC's 2015 form 10-F filing, the company said its two largest customers, one of which is almost certainly Apple, each made up 16% of its total revenue in 2015. That means TSMC's Apple-related revenue in 2015 -- consisting of A8, A8X, and some A9 chip sales -- was around $4.12 billion. It's unlikely that approximately 18 million Mac processors could generate anywhere close to the kind of revenue for TSMC as all those other chips do combined. Indeed, even if TSMC can capture around $50 per chip for a potential Apple-designed Mac processor -- which is probably too high of an estimate -- then this would amount to annual revenue of less than $1 billion per year for TSMC. As TSMC's annual revenue approaches $30 billion, even $1 billion in incremental revenue would be good for only around 3.33% growth. That'd be good business, but hardly a game changer for the chipmaker. Indeed, capturing 100% of the A10 Fusion chip orders for the iPhone 7-series phones, up from a reportedly minority allocation for the A9 processors in the iPhone 6s-series phones, was probably a bigger deal to TSMC than a potential Mac win ever could be.

The 21.5-inch UltraFine 4K Display went up for pre-order at the same time as the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar. At the time, deliveries were estimated to arrive on November 15 at the earliest. Current delivery estimates are quoted at 5 to 6 weeks. Apple debuted the UltraFine Display at its MacBook Pro event last month in 4K and 5K variations. While the 4K display has been available for pre-order since the event, the 5K display is not yet available. The Cupertino company said it partnered with LG to develop the displays specifically for the new MacBook Pro, with Apple making sure that the displays are optimized for its products. Shortly after announcing the displays, Apple confirmed it was out of the standalone display business. The 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar can power either one 5K UltraFine display or two 4K UltraFine displays, while the 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar can power either two 5K displays or four 4K displays. Additionally, both displays include three downstream USB-C ports and can charge a MacBook Pro over the same cable that carries the video and data signals. In early November, Apple dropped the prices of both displays in an effort to smooth the transition for new MacBook Pro owners. The move was combined with price drops for all of Apple's USB-C adapters. The 27-inch 5K UltraFine display is now $974, a $325 price cut from the original price of $1,299. The 4K UltraFine display is now $524, a $175 price cut from the original price of $699. The lowered prices are only available until the end of the year.

They cannot keep thriving and producing double digit growth from where they stand if they try to grow an even larger base of people who pay $1700 for a display. That would be like Ferrari hoping to be Ford. The current Apple leaders want the company to be Ford. Their focus is gone. They're in a game of me-too technocracy. So there you are.

The rear Power plus is in odd location off-center so cable drops down side versus behind the support pole. The thick tick support tube and ugly base. And the cheap plastic. So much for caring about the environment. Clearly this deal was last minute by Apple and rushed by LG. It's why there are no pre-orders. it's still in the labs. I just hope there aren't quality issues due to the rush. Apple needs to remember pros care about the aesthetic of their environment. They should have insisted on a better case, or even better, had Jon's team design something. My dream is LG fixes the case and we see a new form factor before launch. I'll buy two if they clean up the form factor. It shows that it is all about the $ now completely. At apple, does anyone use and external monitor? Would these monitors line up Apples "all Apple" type of ecosystem, especially in their Campus? Apple use to be into the "look" of things and everything being in synergy. They made apple brand mouses, keyboards etc. just so everything is in synergy for the inclusive experience. They use to make the products for themselves (or at least that is what they use to say). Jony is all about design over form which is ok (that is what he prefers). Because they cannot get their margins on a monitor they stop making a monitor?, that sounds more like a company that is solely "bean counting" which now the New Apple (its ok I guess - it made them where they are today). Again, like I have said before, if a company's vision is that, it is ok (as most have to be to stay in business) but apple does not need to operate now like this. It shows that management does not use their products much besides for just photos of their grandkids, surfing the internet and "bean counting" spread sheets (probably now use Excel). I suspect that they only use an iPhone and the the new underpowered MacBook because that is all they need. I would love to know what tech gear they actually now use personally. When Steve Jobs worked with Pixar the Mac Pro was important...why? because he was hanging around those that do creative stuff and wanted them to use Apple stuff. When watching "Toy Story" being created, he probably hated to watch it on a windows XP machine or a Dell or Samsung (ugly at the time) monitor. The Cinema Display was born with the all black edge, giving it a "Cinema feel"...thus the name. With an Apple silver on Black logo on the bottom middle while "His" collaborated movie creation seen above. A beautiful thing... (My thoughts of course). I own the expensive thunderbolt monitor and before the Cinema monitor also. Now...ugly experience... The Mac Pro and the Mini excelled when Jobs was around because....he hung around creative content developers who said, This is what we need to do your dreams Steve (i.e. animation stuff). So..Mac Pro had to be a power house to process animation and video...and a Apple monitor to be seen on so it did not drive jobs crazy seeing his creation on nothing less... Now...sigh....

No. The Apple you know is over. They cannot keep thriving and producing double digit growth from where they stand if they try to grow an even larger base of people who pay $1700 for a display. That would be like Ferrari hoping to be Ford. The current Apple leaders want the company to be Ford. Their focus is gone. They're in a game of me-too technocracy. So there you are. You're so wrong it almost hurts. These monitors are basically a steal, and that's a very good thing, any way you slice it.

Designed for all new Apple products, the WySky Music Light is a one stop shop for playing music, charging your phone, and setting the mood all at the same time. "As music lovers, we've always loved speaker systems that plug directly into your phone while it charges, but we thought something was missing." says founder Jeff Wu. "When you listen to music, so much of the pleasure and the experience depends on mood and lighting. So we wanted to combine the sound of music with the ambient lighting of the room, all in a single device. It's a great way to unwind during dinner, at a party, or with a book or a partner after a long day." Most lamps have a set color -- either warm white light, cold white light, or a colored light. WySky is the first lamp that allows you to blend any color together, which means you can choose the precise shade and color that is best suited to your room or mood. The lamp is fully integrated with iOS 10 (iOS 6.1 and newer), is MFi-approved by Apple, and works with iPhone, iPad, and iPod. The team has gone through several iterations of this product to be able to provide the highest quality sound and light. It includes a 4 inch full-range speaker to fill the room with hi-definition audio and 81 LEDs that won't burn out or get hot to the touch, and a software interface which allows for selection within a 16 million color spectrum. The WySky Music Lamp is designed to complement and enhance a mindful lifestyle. It was inspired by the founders' love of music, design, Apple products, and having a quiet and beautiful space to relax every single day. In exchange for pledging to the project, backers can choose from five different styles of varying colors, starting at $99. Each lamp comes will the full range of lighting options, an alarm clock feature, and a 4" full range speaker. Backers have until Wednesday, November 23rd to pre-order and can expect to receive their Music Lamps in January 2017.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 11, 2016 at 9:22PM Over on Seeking Alpha, contributor Black Coral Research recently argued that were Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to transition away from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) processors in its Mac line of computers, contract chip manufacturer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) would be a big winner. Apple MacBook Pro computers. Image source: Apple.  "TSMC is benefiting from the halo effect of solid iPhone 7 sales, but its real potential is when Apple decides to design its own silicon for its Mac," the contributor writes. "We estimate that TSMC could generate $5.5 billion in annual revenues from such a venture, leading to 20% revenue and earnings growth." This analysis doesn't stand up to scrutiny. Here's why. The current Mac supplier doesn't even generate that much The biggest problem with this analysis is that it assumes that TSMC will be able to charge Apple a whopping $300 per chip for Apple-designed Mac processors. This is absurd, because this would imply that TSMC would make significantly more from building each Apple-designed Mac processor than current Mac processor provider Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) makes on average from the chips it sells Apple. A quick way to "prove" this assertion is as follows: Apple ships roughly 20 million Mac computers each year, give or take a few million. If Intel sold processors to Apple at an average of $300 apiece, then Intel would generate roughly $6 billion per year in revenue from Apple. Per Intel's form 10-K filings for 2013, 2014, and 2015, Apple wasn't responsible for at least 10% of Intel's revenues in those years. In those years, Intel's revenue was solidly south of $60 billion, so we know that Apple pays much less than $300 for Intel processors on average. Further, even if Intel did take in that much per chip from Apple, Apple's per-unit costs would be lower for Apple-designed chips manufactured by a third party, since the third party isn't getting paid for the chip design. The iPhone opportunity is much larger than the Mac opportunity The Seeking Alpha post suggests that TSMC would have a bigger opportunity to profit from Apple's building an in-house Mac processor than it does from having a monopoly on the iPhone 7 A-series processor business -- as well as the A8, A8X, and A9X chips that currently power the iPad. That doesn't make sense. In Apple's last fiscal year, it shipped nearly 212 million iPhones and 45.59 million iPads. It shipped just 18.484 million Macs in that period. In terms of chip area, and therefore chip dollar content to TSMC, an Intel processor isn't much larger than a high-end iPhone or iPad processor. The A10 Fusion measures in at 125 square millimeters in TSMC's 16-nanometer process; the A9X comes in at 147 square millimeters. These are already large, high-silicon and thus high-dollar content chips to TSMC. Even if we assume Intel's average content across Apple's Mac lineup is twice that found in an iPad processor, TSMC's winning the Apple business over from Intel would amount to the addition of roughly 36 million iPad processors' worth of revenue. In TSMC's 2015 form 10-F filing, the company said its two largest customers, one of which is almost certainly Apple, each made up 16% of its total revenue in 2015. That means TSMC's Apple-related revenue in 2015 -- consisting of A8, A8X, and some A9 chip sales -- was around $4.12 billion. It's unlikely that approximately 18 million Mac processors could generate anywhere close to the kind of revenue for TSMC as all those other chips do combined. Indeed, even if TSMC can capture around $50 per chip for a potential Apple-designed Mac processor -- which is probably too high of an estimate -- then this would amount to annual revenue of less than $1 billion per year for TSMC. As TSMC's annual revenue approaches $30 billion, even $1 billion in incremental revenue would be good for only around 3.33% growth. That'd be good business, but hardly a game changer for the chipmaker. Indeed, capturing 100% of the A10 Fusion chip orders for the iPhone 7-series phones, up from a reportedly minority allocation for the A9 processors in the iPhone 6s-series phones, was probably a bigger deal to TSMC than a potential Mac win ever could be.

Log in Sign up Login with Facebook Login with Google Go Advanced News Reviews Phones Home News Blog Reviews Comments (18) Post your comment Standalone Apple Support app is launching for iOS 11 November 2016 Apple is currently rolling out a new app for iOS devices. It's called Apple Support and should be available soon in all countries through the App Store. For now, it only shows up in the store for the Netherlands, but that's clearly just a temporary thing. The rollout to other territories might be taking a few days though. The standalone Apple Support app groups everything that's support-related into one place. Its homepage lists your existing Apple devices, including detailed model information. It also offers some featured "How To" articles, which should be tailored to the products you own. The app lets you chat with customer support reps, and schedule visits to physical Apple Stores for repairs. It contains a History section where all of your support queries are listed. Genius Bar appointments can be scheduled through the Apple Store app too, and Apple also has a Tips app that launched with iOS 8 to give you quick feature tutorials, but the new Apple Support app brings all of these things together rather neatly. Hopefully it will become available across the world soon. Source Share Facebook Twitter © 2000-2016 GSMArena.com All brands | Privacy | Terms | Contact us Desktop version

(Google) I always thought Google was missing out on a great opportunity in not having its own phone to take advantage of its Android operating system. Apple learned early on that controlling entire hardware and software systems was the way to go, but Google seemed content to just work on the software end. Sure, there were a few forgettable Google-branded Nexus phones, but they were far from the best Android handsets. Now Google has decided to dive in head-first and design its own phones, the Google Pixel and Pixel XL. HTC is building the phones, but the design is all Google’s. Let’s get one thing out of the way first – Google’s Pixel looks like an iPhone. That’s not necessarily a bad thing. Apple has sold millions of iPhones, and the design and look are proven hits. But even though it looks like an iPhone and costs the same as the iPhone (starting at $650), there are hardware differences that are worth mentioning. HARDWARE AND SPECS I’ve been using the non-XL Pixel for the last few weeks, so my hands-on thoughts will focus on the smaller version. The Pixel is built around a 5-inch AMOLED screen made from Corning Gorilla Glass 4 with a resolution of 1920 by 1080 pixels (441 pixels per inch). It runs a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 quad-core processor with four gigabytes of RAM and ships with 32 gigabytes or 128 gigabytes of storage. The sleep-wake button is high on the right edge, but the volume rocker button is also on the right. This put all the buttons comfortably under your thumb (if you’re right-handed). The big difference in the Pixel’s design is the placement of the fingerprint sensor on the phone’s back, which happens to be exactly where my index finger rests when I’m holding the phone. Putting the fingerprint reader on the back isn’t really better or worse than the iPhone’s front placement – it’s a matter of taste. Because the Pixel chose the back, I have to pick up the phone to unlock it with my finger. I do find I keep my iPhone lying on my desk, so I am able to just touch my finger to the reader without picking up the phone to check a message or text. The body is made of aluminum, but the top third of the phone’s backside is also glass. The main camera has a 12-megapixel sensor and an f/2.0 lens. The front camera has an 8-megapixel sensor with an f/2.4 lens. The camera is top-notch. The Pixel is on par with Apple’s iPhone 7 or Samsung’s Galaxy S7 Edge. I can’t say enough nice things about the camera on the Pixel. I also love invoking the camera app by a quick double flip of the phone or double tapping the sleep-wake button. Google also includes unlimited cloud storage for all photos and videos taken with the Pixel. The charger is USB-C, which seems to be where the world is headed (except for iPhones). The Pixel’s USB-C port uses the faster USB 3.0, which means much faster transfers. According to Google, 15 minutes of USB-C charging from the included 18-watt power supply will provide seven hours of power. The Pixel’s physical dimensions are 5.6 inches by 2.7 inches by 0.2 inches, and it weighs 5.04 ounces. It’s about a quarter of an inch longer than my iPhone 6s. The 2,770 ampere-hour battery easily lasted a day for my use. You’ll find the usual radios – 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.2 along with near field communication. There are a few features you won’t find on the Pixel, including water resistance and stereo speakers (there’s just one). There is no slot for adding storage, and the Pixel does not have wireless charging. ANDROID IN ALL ITS GLORY You may have used Android phones before, but you really haven’t used Android as Google intended. Different wireless carriers and phone manufacturers put their own software on top of Android, often cluttering up the landscape. The Pixel runs pure, unadulterated Android 7.1, and it’s the only phone to feature Google’s new Assistant. Simply say “OK, Google,” and you’ll invoke the Google Assistant, which will answer questions, manage tasks, find photos, entertain you and help you stay on schedule. I think Google’s Assistant is much better than Apple’s Siri. You can have an actual conversation with Assistant. I asked the Assistant how to get to a local park, and the directions from my location were displayed on a Google map. Then I asked, “When was it built?” and the Assistant brought up an article about the park and when it was built. Very cool. There are some other Android tweaks you’ll notice. I had to look up the way you call up the app list on the Pixel. With other Android phones, you’ll have an icon to bring up all the apps. On the Pixel, you swipe up from the bottom of the screen to bring up the apps. The apps are also pretty uniform in their appearance. All the included app icons are round. Third-party apps still can be shaped differently, but I like the round look. Overall the phone was very snappy and responsive. CONCLUSIONS I’m really happy Google has decided to get into the phone game. The company has the most popular operating system, and it’s about time it designed its own hardware to take advantage of it. I’m a longtime iPhone user, so I’m a sucker for the design. I’m still on the fence about the fingerprint sensor placement. There is a lot to like about the Pixel and Pixel XL. I realize this isn’t an in-depth review, but there are plenty of places online to find those. The Pixel is a hit with me, and it joins the iPhone and Samsung Galaxy 7 phones in the top tier of handsets. I can’t wait to see what Google does with the next version of the Pixel The Pixel costs $649 and the XL costs $769 for the 32gb model. Add $100 to each to increase the storage to 128gb. They are available from Google, Verizon stores or Best Buy. You might see commercials or websites that say the Pixel is a Verizon exclusive, but that’s just for sales. If you buy the Pixel through Google, it’s unlocked for use on any carrier.

His words and his example still inspires a world hungry for everything that Jobs stood for. Steve’s bodily absence is compensated in the legacy of thoughts and ideas he left this world. Steve Jobs, the father of Apple, iPhone, and iOS, was a versatile man, forever caught in the balance of enlightenment and ambition. Caught in a decision between joy and effort, he forged a way to have both. He leaves a legacy of ideas for those willing to read, listen, and learn from his example. Apple, iPhone, and iOS almost never happened. It is a little-known fact that Steve Jobs almost chose enlightenment over ambition. Read more in this Inquisitr story. If that had happened, iPhone would be nothing except perhaps an occasional typo. Steve Jobs almost decided to devote his life to spiritual questing in India. He was ready to join an Ashram, but in the end, ambition won out over enlightenment, or did it? Steve Jobs, in fact, learned to use his spiritual nature and his ambition to gift the world with a new means of innovation. Steve Jobs created iPhone, built Apple as a brilliant company, and developed iOS as a platform of infinite creative possibilities. These are the things Jobs did, but why and how are important questions to ask. Steve Jobs believed in what he was doing. Jobs believed in a formula based on feeling passion, changing the world, and breaking all the rules. How else can one individual make a mark on the world? 1. Steve Jobs Endorsed Passion Above All, As The Deciding Factor Of Success <noscript><iframe width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gxo2rGr7Yfg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> For Steve Jobs, Apple was all about Passion. Passion is the first principle of success, according to Jobs. Everything else depends on having a Jobs-level passion. Successful people do what they love, and then it is easier to continue loving what they do. Entrepreneur quoted Jobs as follows. “People with passion can change the world for the better.” Steve Jobs was quoted in DIY Genius, revealing the secrets behind Apple’s success. “People say you have to have a lot of passion for what you’re doing and it’s totally true. And the reason is because it’s so hard that if you don’t, any rational person would give up. It’s really hard. And you have to do it over a sustained period of time.” Steve Jobs felt there were two kinds of workers in this world who create two different types of work for themselves. There are those who work out of need, responsibility, and obligation, and no matter what those people do it is drudgery. Then there are those who work out of a passion for making everything better with their efforts. Those people excel while the others fail or barely hang on. “So if you don’t love it, if you’re not having fun doing it, you don’t really love it, you’re going to give up. And that’s what happens to most people, actually. If you really look at the ones that ended up, you know, being ‘successful’ in the eyes of society and the ones that didn’t, oftentimes, it’s the ones who were successful loved what they did so they could persevere when it got really tough.” Steve Jobs felt so strongly about this that he suggested prospective entrepreneurs without passion take a menial ordinary job to gain experience until passion struck them with a calling in life, one that would fuel their real ambitions. Without true passion and only a sense of duty and drudgery, entrepreneurship will always fail, and so will any but the most menial and rudimentary of jobs. According to Apple founder Steve Jobs, people just have the wrong idea about working. They think they are supposed to hate it, to get tired of it and take time off, without even giving it a thought during the time they are away. They are supposed to compartmentalize their job definition and keep it separate from their real life. That’s not how it works for successful people. It takes passion. “A good answer to the question ‘What time do you leave work?’ is to say, ‘Never, since my work is my passion.’ But it takes a genius to continue by saying, ‘And by the way, my passion is design.'” Finally, the Apple guru advises to always follow your heart, according to Clickhole. “Whatever you do, you must never let the voice in your head control the brain in your heart.” 2. Steve Jobs On Changing The World <noscript><iframe width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gO6cFMRqXqU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> Steve Jobs, the father of Apple and creator of the iPhone, once told John Sculley, then president of Pepsi Cola Company, that he needed a bigger vision for change, according to Entrepreneur. “Do you want to spend your life selling sugar water or do you want to change the world?” Apple had one purpose in Steve Jobs’ mind. To change the world. He wanted to make life better for everyone. He was an innovator who always wanted a brighter future and what was best for the world. So how can just anyone make a difference? Steve Jobs would tell people to dream bigger, and get the message of your dream out there so people can understand it. They want to know what the Apple iPhone, for example, can do for them. They don’t usually care about all the technical stuff the company did. They want to know what the product, service, or idea does for them. Therefore, Steve Jobs believed in designing in a way that improved lives. From the beginning of the creative process to the end of the sale and beyond to customer service, it has to be about what people need. Good ideas are about benefiting others, not just making money. Of course, Steve Jobs cared about money. Sure he had to eat, just like everyone else. He provided rather well for himself by anyone’s definition, but he knew when he went into business that the customers don’t buy because of the CEO’s needs or the employee’s needs. Apple customers buy iPhones, iPads, and etc. because the products being offered meet their needs. Therefore, the customers need comes first, and in the end, it is all about making the world better for those customers. It is really all about a universal spiritual principle of putting others first, but that principle works very well in business. 3. Steve Jobs On Breaking The Rules <noscript><iframe width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8rwsuXHA7RA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> Apple founder Steve Jobs seemed to be born hating the status quo, and loving the troublemakers. Jobs was quoted from an iconic Apple commercial seen in the video above. “Here’s to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They’re not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing, you can’t do is ignore them.” Then Steve Jobs went on to explain why. This bit of advertising explains another secret of success. “Because they change things. They push the human race forward. While some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.” Apple founder Steve Jobs encouraged crime, not the type that breaks laws or hurts people, but he definitely thought the world was full of rules to be broken. “Be a criminal. Commit crimes. I’m not talking about crimes against the law. Those aren’t the important ones. You can commit a crime against boredom. Or a crime against ignorance. Commit crimes against bad ideas, and against the people who have them. Then go commit crimes for innovation and for design. Above all, realize that the product itself isn’t the product. The crime is the product.” Steve Jobs was pointing out there are many ways to do things, and those blind enough to believe that only one way is the right way are the real menace to society. Innovation dictates there is always a better way, but sometimes that means breaking rules and traditions that keep all mankind in a rut. 4. Steve Jobs On Being Prepared To Fail And Fail Big Steve Jobs is responsible for fonts on computers, iPhones, iPods and iPads [Image by Anton Ivanov/Shutterstock] Apple founder Steve Jobs recognized that fear of failure is paralyzing. It keeps people from doing anything, right or wrong. People cannot be so afraid to make mistakes they fail because they don’t act. Refusal to take action is a guarantee of failure. “Most people never pick up the phone and call, most people never ask, that’s what separates the people that do things from the people who just dream about them. You’ve got to act. You’ve got to be willing to fail. You’ve got to be willing to crash and burn.” The willingness to move forward, even if an attempt fails, is part of business. Of course, there are times when one can’t afford to fail, that is where “no” comes in. For all his positivity, Steve Jobs believed in the power of saying no to bad ideas, but he also believed in saying yes to the right idea at the right time. Making a strong move, without hesitation, is part of the path to success. 5. Steve Jobs On Design Apple logo as design [Image by Kena Betancur/Shutterstock] The most important word in the world to Steve Jobs was design, but he never, ever meant appearance. To Jobs, everything was part of design. One idea would flow into another based on a tremendous base of everyday experiences that were all material for design. “Most people make the mistake of thinking design is what it looks like. People think it’s this veneer — that the designers are handed this box and told, ‘Make it look good!’ That’s not what we think design is. It’s not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.” Apple was always largely about design. iPhones are not all that different on the outside, and one might think, what design, but the design of what it does is simply amazing. The form gives way to function as design. RELATED REPORTS FROM THE INQUISITR How iPhone, Apple, And iOS Almost Never Happened: Steve Jobs’ Quest For Enlightenment Vs.

Amaturo More On: new york giants Giants' offensive-line revolving door is getting ridiculous How Conor McGregor pushed Odell Beckham to another level Giants defense goes in time machine in 4th-quarter onslaught McAdoo made the Eli Manning gamble that Coughlin craves Eight games into his NFL career, and Eli Apple has already run the gamut. He’s played a key role in the Giants’ 5-3 start, and he’s also been benched. He’s missed two games with hamstring and groin injuries, and had to deal with an off-the-field issue involving his outspoken mother’s criticism of the team’s questionable handling of the Josh Brown domestic abuse case. “It’s been up and down, injuries and all,” the Giants first-round pick from Ohio State said Friday, and also added this: “I don’t deal with more than any ordinary guy that plays in the NFL deals with.” After he was pulled in Sunday’s victory over the Eagles, Apple owned it. He was asked if his mother’s two columns on SI.com ripping the Giants and owner John Mara had been a distraction, suggesting they had leaned on her son to quiet her. He said no then, and reiterated the stance on Friday. “Everything’s normal,” said the 21-year-old Apple, who still lives with his mother, Annie, in southern New Jersey. SEE ALSO Eli Apple: My mom's wrong, Giants never pressured me :0 No, the Giants did not pressure Eli Apple, their rookie... Eli Apple: My mom's wrong, Giants never pressured me Of particular importance, the Giants are happy with how Apple has responded to getting pulled. Coach Ben McAdoo said “he’s back in the fold,” and defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo raved about the rookie’s week of practice and said, “No one has lost confidence in Eli.” His role will go back to normal, as a starting outside cornerback, when the Giants host the Bengals on Monday night at MetLife Stadium. “I am a big Eli Apple fan. I have said that from the beginning,” Spagnuolo said. “He is going to help us win football games. He has.” Against the Eagles, Spagnuolo said initially the plan was for him to just sit out a series early in the second half after missing a few tackles and getting beaten for a touchdown, but his replacement, Trevin Wade, played so well, they opted not to bring Apple back in. While the injuries have only cost him two games, they have limited his practice time, which has had an adverse effect. “He hasn’t built [up] the calluses to get through a season like this, so he is struggling a little bit with that,” the defensive coordinator said. “But he is going to be fine. He is on the rise.” In the past, when he’s had bad games, Apple said he has made sure to be extra focused during the week leading up to the next game, taking extra notes, watching more film, spending more time talking to teammates and coaches. “I try to be a little more attentive on things,” he said. “Just try to get comfortable, because if you’re comfortable out there, everything is going to come to you, and you’re just going to start making plays. That’s what I’m trying to get back to. “I feel like I have a great opportunity for this last half of the season to really get back on track, and do what I can to help the defense be the best defense we can be.” Apple credited multiple Giants defensive players with talking to him Sunday, during and after the victory. Strong safety Landon Collins was at the top of the list. The overwhelming message: Don’t doubt yourself. Everyone gets benched sometimes. “They were in my ear, letting me know they still got my back,” he said. The coaching staff has sent a similar message by throwing him back in the fire. Apple is excited to atone for his mistakes, especially playing on Monday night for the first time. “You want to make a great impression. It’s a big game for all of us. It’s another big stage,” Apple said. “It’s going to be an electric atmosphere out there. I’ve never been in MetLife when it’s a night game. Everything is going to be a little amplified. That’s when guys really pick up their games.” The Giants are counting on it from their rookie cornerback.

Anytime. Anywhere. NEWS OPS By Alex Hern. Updated November 7, 2016 9:14AM SHARE ALSO SEE Apple MacBook Pro Enterprise Hardware Wall Street Earnings Samsung Apple Watch Dongles USB Apple has dropped the price on a number of USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 peripherals after the launch of the new MacBook Pro, which faced a barrage of criticism for launching with no ports other than the new USB standard. Prices for most USB-C adapters Apple makes have been dropped, in some cases by as much as half. The company has also dropped the price of third-party peripherals by 25%, including the 4K and 5K LG screens the company demonstrated late last month, and a SanDisk SD card reader has received a special price cut of 40%. The older Retina MacBook Pros contained USB type-A ports (the classic port shape for the standard), an SD card slot, an HDMI ports, and a number of Thunderbolt 2 ports using the miniDisplayPort standard. While all of that functionality can be replicated with external dongles, many users who were used to the built-in capabilities on the previous generation have complained about the need to carry more cables. “Having four USB-C ports is awesome,” wrote Instapaper and Overcast founder Marco Arment. “Having only four USB-C ports is going to hurt the versatility requirement of pro gear, because there’s a very real chance that you won’t have the right dongle when you need it.” In a statement, Apple said: “We recognise that many users, especially pros, rely on legacy connectors to get work done today and they face a transition. We want to help them move to the latest technology and peripherals, as well as accelerate the growth of this new ecosystem. Through the end of the year, we are reducing prices on all USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 peripherals we sell, as well as the prices on Apple’s USB-C adapters and cables.” The absence of conventional ports is only one half of the negative response to the new MacBook Pro. Many power users have also said the machines are underpowered: they can have no more than 16GB of RAM -- the same as four-year-old Retina MacBook Pros -- and the Intel processors they contain are reportedly only slightly faster than the models they replace. © 2016 Guardian Web syndicated under contract with NewsEdge.

An objective decision can’t be easily made, because preference in this matter heavily depend on needs and tastes of users, and every one of us wants something different from their devices. Android is mostly loved by those who prefer more choice in picking out devices that suit them, while iOS users are fond of the exclusivity that comes with being a part of Apple club. The truth is that both companies provide more than solid service for their clients, and it’s only nuances that help people make up their mind in favour of one of the other brand. Here we’ll discuss what exactly makes Android better than iOS and why you can benefit more by using Android devices. Android Is Acceptable For Any Price Range The first downside that everyone will bring about Apple technology is that they are much pricier than their Android antipodes. This is really true, seeing that you need a substantial sum of money just to buy the latest iPhone, not to mention iPads and Mac products. On the other hand, you can get an excellent Android smartphone for half the price of an iPhone, and its specifications will be more than satisfying. Whatever your needs are when it comes to mobile devices, Android will give you a long price list to choose from, so that you can find one that fits your budget. This was never the case with iOS, where you know that the “Apple club membership” doesn’t come cheap, and you pay for the exclusivity of having an Apple product. This was always the goal of Apple’s founder Steve Jobs – to develop an entire market that would cater exclusively to Apple and its offspring, and so far they’ve accomplished their mission. Android is much more pliable, and you can see it best through the wide range of prices it has to offer to its clients. Different Devices For Different Prices Now you can choose iPhone in gold and rose gold, which is quite advanced, seeing that Apple’s always been quite conservative when it comes to the design of their devices. Android operated devices, on the other hand, well, there are thousands to choose from and the choice isn’t always easy. Bigger variety in every aspect is probably what makes Android stand out most comparing to Apple, though you can find cliques within Android community as well. You can always find people who are allegiant to a certain brand and will gladly argue that there is no better. We suggest not getting too involved in these arguments, because they prove to be pointless, but the fact remains that you can choose from over 24,000 different Android devices. This is a ridiculously high number, and compared with the number of unique products that Apple has, it’s more than clear that Android won the race of diversity by a lot. You Can Actually Customise Your Android Device As we mentioned earlier, Apple is quite unyielding when it comes to changing any aspect of their products, both when it comes to how it looks like and how it operates. Just take a look at the iPhone 7 and already infamous AirPods, which cost $160 and which you’ll have to own if you want to listen to music, because the standard headphones’ jack simply doesn’t exist on the phone anymore. Remember how we talked about exclusivity? Android opted out for a completely different tune, and you can do pretty much anything you want with your Android device. You can use virtually any app, any theme or program you can think of, without having to deal with configuration troubles that often emerge with iOS devices. Having a highly customised device helps you both in terms of security and user experience, while with Apple products what you see is what you get, there isn’t much room for improvisation. One other interesting fact is that when you’re buying airline tickets or booking a hotel on the web, you will pay more for it when you’re buying from an iOS device. The policy behind it is clear – if you had $160 to pay for headphones, you can pay some more for {enter product/service name here}. Thankfully, you don’t have to worry about this when buying with Android devices. More Free Apps And Don’t Forget About Widgets iTunes App Store is alpha and omega when it comes to getting any sort of app for your iOS system, and if what you need can’t be found on iTunes App Store, there’s pretty much nothing you can do. When it comes to Android, you’ve got Google store, and if that doesn’t work, you can simply choose a safe website from which you can download anything you need. One other perk of Google store is that there’s a much bigger variety of free apps than on iStore and they will work just as well if not even better. Even when it comes to the aspect of security, some of the strongest VPNs can be used on Android without a glitch, so that you can protect your device easily, while you would have to pay for it through iTunes Store/App Market and sometimes face configuration problems. Also, while you can forget about widgets with Apple technology, you are more than welcome to use them on Android devices. Android Gets On With Google, iOS Not So Much You’re probably aware that Google is the beating heart of World Wide Web, and very little can be done without it. Millions of people use all the perks that Google has to offer, be it for business, pleasure or all in between. Android realised the importance of integrating with Google long time ago, which is why today we can see that these two operate together without a fault. Things aren’t that great when it comes to iOS. There will be lags and all other sorts of trouble when you try to operate with Google services. They will work, but it won’t be without difficulty, as Apple always strives for its users to focus on what Apple has to offer. So, if you’re an avid Google services user, then it would definitely be wiser to use Android devices to avoid problems that can happen with iOS. We’ve already mentioned that the choice of devices you will use every day very much depends on what you want to get out of it. If you’ve been playing for Android team for some time, then you can easily recognise and confirm all advantages we talked about. Both iOS and Android are a good choice, it would seem, only on different levels, which is why it’s crucial to know what your preferences and likes/dislikes are, so that you can make an informed decision.

"Following" : "Follow"}} November 12, 2016 3:09pm   Comments Share: Related DIS Wall Street's Post-Quarter Commentary On ESPN The Election May Have Solved The NFL's Ratings Problems Disney rides 'Doctor Strange' to best-ever domestic year (Seeking Alpha) Shares of Walt Disney Co (NYSE: DIS) gained more than 3 percent as investors showed faith in the company’s vision of earnings growth acceleration in 2018. The upbeat comments on the call helped shares regain from initial losses after lower-than-expected fourth quarter results. Disney’s quarterly earnings of $1.10 per share on revenue of $13.14 billion missed consensus view of $1.16 per share and $13.52 billion. The company has several levers of growth -- Shanghai Disney Resort, Parks, solid film slate, positive fundamentals at Media Networks and Interactive. “With the industry continuing to change at a rapid pace and with the  stock trading on a significant P/E premium to peers, most investors may consider it too  early  to  focus  beyond  next  year – but we think the comments remove some of the downside risk to earnings forecasts near term,” Credit Suisse analyst Omar Sheikh wrote in a note. The most bullish comment on the call was its statement that the causes of domestic ESPN subscriber losses "have abated." Disney also highlighted that digital MVPDs (Sling, DirecTV NOW, Hulu) would tap incremental demand from cord-cutters and cord-nevers and these new entrants “will offer ESPN opportunities they haven't had before to reach people." The company's guided for "modest" EPS growth in 2017, but "more robust" in 2018. Management also affirmed that growth would accelerate in 2018 (consensus expects 11 percent), particularly driven by the film slate. “We think the guidance makes it hard to assume any of Disney's segments will decline in 2018 vs 2017, so this relatively innocuous-sounding comment is likely to be a reason for investors to reduce bearish bets on the stock, in our view,” Sheikh highlighted. Disney added that the Shanghai Disney Resort had seen four million guests in the first four months of operation. The company also expects share buybacks between $7 billion and $8 billion for the year in 2017, versus the $7.5 billion spent on buybacks in 2016. Sheikh has an Outperform rating, with a price target of $125 on Disney shares.

Alvin R. Cabral Filed on November 14, 2016 | Last updated on November 14, 2016 at 06.11 am Share More > Vote Concept iPhone design showing a zero-bezel display; note the earpiece and front camera on top embedded into the screen. (ConceptsiPhone) Talks of a zero bezel iPhone been resurrected, with more information leaking out. For those of you who were frustrated with how the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus panned out, we're here to give you a glimpse of hope - some tidbits swirling around what has been dubbed the "iPhone 8". The iPhone 7 did have some fairly nice upgrades, though many expected it to have some different flavour in terms of design - it basically is the iPhone 6 and 6s. To start off, it is said that the next iPhones will come in slightly bigger variants - 5 and 5.8-inch models from the present 4.7 and 5.5-inchers. Khaleej Times reported in May that the next Apple flagship could be an all-glass device. Talks have been resurrected, and with more information leaking out. Barclays supply chain analysts say that the next iPhones may have a zero-bezel design, meaning a totally edge-to-edge display up front. This would, however, require one major design overhaul: removing the iconic home button on the iPhone. From there, it may branch out into (at least) two options: the first may see the display extend all the way down, but saving enough room to retain the earpiece and front camera on top, or, second, embed those two into the display. The fingerprint sensor, then, may be embedded in the display itself. Now that would be a stunner: remember, no other company has been able to offer this design so far. Apple design master Jony Ive has wanted an iPhone that looks like "a single sheet of glass", and 2017 may just be the year he realises that. And there's more to that: word has it that Apple may leave an extra 7.25mm of display on each side that may be used to wrap around the edges of the device, according to MacRumors - though it is unclear if this is actually achievable with the zero-bezel design. The next iPhones may also utilise an OLED display, (finally) veering from the long-serving LCDs used in the devices. The Nikkei Asian Review, however, had previously reported that Apple plans to adopt this screen technology in 2018. And with what could make for a nice contest is what the next iPhone will be called. Aside from "iPhone 8" the hotly-rumoured "iPhone Pro" is also in the mix. Calling the next devices "iPhone 7s" is quite a remote possibility, since next year will mark the iPhone's 10th anniversary...so how about "iPhone X"? - alvin@khaleejtimes.com Share More > Vote MORE FROM Technology Technology Hijab emojis set to come to iPhones next year The consortium that approves emojis has signed off new ones,...

Ancient Egyptians had their hieroglyphics. Now, millennials and technophiles have their own modern-day version of an esoteric code that's hard to decipher. Emojis have become the universal way the digital world communicates with each other — as well as a staple of smartphones, tablets and even Apple's new laptop. They've been around for years, but a recent San Francisco-based conference, dubbed "Emoijcon," shone a spotlight on how important the quirky characters are becoming to major brands, tech enthusiasts and those who create them. The conference was organized by Jeanne Brooks, Jennifer 8. Lee and Yiying Lu, founders of "Emojination," a campaign that works with Unicode, the international computing standard for use of different languages or scripts. Last week, the consortium approved 51 new characters for use in mobile devices. Most of the world's writing system includes Unicode, and every character receives a different number, which has extended to emojis. Emojination has designed a dumpling, chopsticks, fortune cookie and a takeout box, and has submitted them for consideration. Underscoring how the characters are becoming both a social phenomenon and branding opportunity, sponsors like GE, Adobe and Baidu already use emojis in their businesses. Domino's Pizza lets its Twitter followers order by emoji, while Coca-Cola's #ShareaCoke campaign automatically generated a custom emoji. 'Every character in the world' Source: iTunes Screens of the KIMOJI app Tayfun Karadeniz, a mobile app entrepreneur and CEO of EmojiXpress, is one of the voting members of the Unicode Consortium and part of the group's Emoji Committee. EmojiXpress is the company behind one of the most downloaded emoji keyboards that combines emojis and stickers. Unicode wants to "include every character in the world and make sure to look at the existing characters in the world, they assign it a unique code so different devices can communicate to each other," said Karadeniz "Then an Android device knows what the text message that an iOS device sent means." Karadeniz explained that the idea for emojis originated in the 1990s, when early Japanese telecom providers let users send pixelated faces to each other, which gradually evolved into a wide array of faces, gestures and animals, among other things. Unicode has become an unexpected arbiter, but not in the business of creating emoji images. Instead, the group looks at what exists, then decides on whether the popularity is enough that it should be considered for the universal standard. When it created the iPhone in 2007, Apple made its own emojis to comply with this code. "To them, this was just another alphabet they had to support," said Karadeniz. "Originally when the iPhone originally came out, the emoji keyboard was only available to the Japanese region." What seemed like something only Japanese users would use, quickly grew in popularity with Americans and other smartphone users around the world. With Apple's iOS5 operating system, the emoji keyboard is now unlocked for all users. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty Images Craig Federighi, senior vice president of Software Engineering at Apple Inc., speaks during the Apple World Wide Developers Conference (WWDC) in San Francisco. Celebrities like Kim Kardashian make customized emoji keyboards, which are actually considered "stickers" or images instead of numbered characters like emojis. Using stickers rather than emojis can come in the form of animations or still images, and they only work on select platforms — much like Facebook messenger stickers that you can only send on the social network. Though emojis are generally known as nondescript yellow faces, in recent years there has been a push by consumers for more diversity. Apple introduced diverse emojis last year allowing users to choose between different skin colors and more. One of the contenders approved by last Tuesday is a character wearing a hijab, or a scarf worn for religious reasons by Muslim women. The idea came from Rayouf Alhumedhi's hijab emoji, and is part of a wide-ranging effort to make emojis more ethnically diverse. As a 15-year-old Saudi teen living in Germany, Alhumedhi didn't see herself in the emojis that are currently available. "There are millions of hijabi women like me who use digital media avidly," she told the Emojicon conference. "If there are four emojis, four spaces on the keyboard reserved for the four stages of a mailbox, why on earth isn't there one for a hijab for the 500 million" hijab-wearing women, she added. With the help of some of the industry's players, she polished her proposal, inspired by a "how to" guide on proposing an emoji she found on Snapchat. Miguel Medina | AFP | Getty Images However, proposals can however take a long time to be approved. Proposed emojis are sent in by an October deadline, presented in November at a Unicode meeting and then may take more than a year to land in the set of standardized emoji.

Icahn, a billionaire activist investor, says he believes Trump will take the country in the right direction and improve the economy. “The country must go in and be a friend to business,” Icahn said during an interview with CNN’s Poppy Harlow. Icahn opened up about his views and where they differ from Trump’s On repealing Dodd-Frank Trump has said his regulation policy would be “close to dismantling Dodd-Frank.” The Dodd-Frank law was established after the 2008 financial crisis in an effort to force banks to keep more cash on hand and take other steps to prevent another crisis. Icahn said he doesn’t think “repealing Dodd-Frank is the answer.” He continued by noting that a lot of the problems that led to the financial crisis were “the result of not having some of our investment bankers regulated, and they were selling products that shouldn’t have been sold.” On joining Trump in Washington While Trump has praised Icahn and insisted that the U.S. needs someone like him in the White House, Icahn himself said he has no desire to assume the role of Treasury secretary. “I’m not gonna go to Washington,” the 80-year-old Icahn said. “My personality is such I’ve never worked for anyone in my life and I’m not gonna start now at my age.” However, he did say that he hopes the government will listen and follow his advice, “which is simply to go in and literally get rid of a lot of the regulatory agency positions.” On Janet Yellen and the Federal Reserve Trump has said Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen had kept interest rates low for political reasons and should be “ashamed of herself.” Ichan said he didn’t blame Yellen because she didn’t have much choice. “I am certainly not going to criticize Janet Yellen,” Icahn said. “However, I agree with Trump on what he was saying generally. You can’t keep an economy going at zero interest rate because it builds bubbles. It builds huge asset bubbles.” Icahn said it was necessary to “stimulate business to invest” and said the government should not be at war with business. He also said it was important to raise interest rates so people can make money on their capital. On Trump’s demand that Apple make products in the U.S. Trump said that if he was elected president, Apple would bring its manufacturing to America. Icahn, who made a lot of money investing in Apple, said he doubts the company will start making its iPhones in America. “I don’t presume to go in and say that Apple should make their iPhones in the United States unless it makes sense for Apple to do it,” Icahn said. “We as a country must make it make sense for Apple to do it, and I think that’s what Donald is saying.” Icahn said that in order to encourage companies to make products in the U.S., they need to be incentivized by changes in tax policy. However, in the case of Apple, Icahn acknowledged the company might be “too entrenched” overseas. Icahn also said he didn’t “agree completely with Donald on the trade deals” such as NAFTA, which Trump has vowed to dismantle. He noted that “you have to tread a little more carefully.” On Trump’s temperament Icahn said he has known Trump for years and can vouch for his temperament, which became an issue during the campaign as he lashed out at critics and made degrading remarks about minorities and women. “If you go back over different periods in our history, where there have been elections, you see a lot of things said. I certainly can find a number of things Hillary Clinton said, that if you really want to replay them you might want to criticize.” “But that’s not the issue. The issue is that this country must take a different approach. The country must be a friend to business, and for eight years we have been anything but that.” Dave Chappelle and the history of the N-word on TV Brian Stelter: Journalists must make time for 'soul searching' after election Related Posts Penn State SBDC Helped Create Businesses, Saved Jobs in 2011 For moviegoers, ‘patriotic duty’ to see ‘The Interview’ 5,300 Wells Fargo employees fired for creating millions of phony accounts Trump University’s ‘top’ instructor’s job was to sell, not teach Leave a Reply Cancel reply You must be logged in to post a comment.

By Matthew DeCarlo on Nov 13, 2016, 12:00 PM TechSpot The GTX 1080 Ti may have 10GB of VRAM Nvidia's GTX Titan class GPUs always come with huge price tags and the Pascal GTX Titan X is no different, costing $1200 in the US. GTX Titan series GPUs have never been about value for money, but they have always resulted in lower end GTX variants like the GTX 780Ti or GTX 980Ti that provide gamers with relatively good value for money. Ever since the GTX Titan X launched the big question on consumers lips was "where is the GTX 1080Ti", knowing that a more affordable variant is in the works. Now, a Nvidia GPU that is thought to be the GTX 1080 Ti has been found in an Indian shipping manifest... OC3D Intel may add Wi-Fi, USB 3.1 to next-generation chipsets Motherboard chipsets haven’t really changed much in the last few years. There’s been some support for new storage options and standards, like M.2 for SSDs, some limited support for features like Thunderbolt, and faster memory speeds have trickled out over time. Intel might shake things up a bit for its 300-series chipsets in 2017, if rumors are to be believed, with integrated support for Wi-Fi and USB 3.1. ExtremeTech OAuth 2.0 hack exposes 1 billion mobile apps to account hijacking Third-party applications that allow single sign-on via Facebook and Google and support the OAuth 2.0 protocol, are exposed to account hijacking. Three Chinese University of Hong Kong researchers presented at Black Hat EU last week a paper called "Signing into One Billion Mobile LApp Accounts Effortlessly with OAuth 2.0." The paper describes an attack that takes advantage of poor OAuth 2.0 implementations and puts more than one billion apps in jeopardy. Threatpost Customer sues Charter, Time Warner Cable over "Broadcast TV" fees; doesn’t seek monetary damages Last month, Comcast customers accused the cable company of illegally using its "Broadcast TV" and "Regional Sports" fees to raise customers' bills by as much as $10/month. Now a customer of the recently merged Time Warner Cable and Charter Communications is accusing the providers of breaking the law by using similar fees to hide rate hikes while implying to subscribers that these surcharges are required by the government.

Facebook Google Pixel pwned in 60 seconds Power of Community The Google Pixel fell to a team of Chinese hackers alongside Apple Safari and Adobe Flash at the PwnFest hacking competition in Seoul on Friday.

Robot solves rubik's cube in less than a second Solving a Rubik's Cube is an impressive feat by itself, but now, a robot can do it in record time, cracking the 3D puzzle about 10 times faster than the human who holds the world record. In just over half of a second (0.637 seconds), the Sub1 Reloaded robot made each side of the Rubik's Cube show a single color. This breaks the previous record of 0.887 seconds achieved by an earlier version of the same machine using a different processor. Live Science Apple said to release curved, bezel-free 5-inch and 5.8-inch iPhones next year Apple will release new 5-inch and 5.8-inch iPhones with curved, bezel-free designs next year, according to Barclays Research analysts Blayne Curtis, Christopher Hemmelgarn, Thomas O'Malley, and Jerry Zhang. The analysts, citing sources within Apple's supply chain following a trip to Asia this week, said the borderless design will allow for the new iPhones to be the same overall size as current 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch models. MacRumors DIY coprocessors for the Game Boy Color Back in the olden days, when video games still came on cartridges, the engineers and programmers making these carts had a lot of options. One of the most inventive, brilliant, and interesting cartridges to come out of the 90s was Star Fox for the Super Nintendo. Star Fox featured a coprocessor chip, the Super FX, that was effectively a GPU used to draw polygons in the frame buffer. Hackaday Video games are boring Video games are bigger than movies. Everyone's a gamer. I've devoted my life-no exaggeration-to video games for 14 years, working on titles such as Company of Heroes, a few Assassin's Creeds, and Child of Light. But everywhere I go, I meet people who don't like video games. Most of my friends don't like video games. And one of my favourite things when I'm meeting a new person is to watch them squirm, to struggle to relate, after I mention I work in the video game industry. Games Industry Artificial-intelligence system surfs web to improve its performance Of the vast wealth of information unlocked by the Internet, most is plain text. The data necessary to answer myriad questions -- about, say, the correlations between the industrial use of certain chemicals and incidents of disease, or between patterns of news coverage and voter-poll results — may all be online. But extracting it from plain text and organizing it for quantitative analysis may be prohibitively time consuming. MIT LipNet: How easy do you think lipreading is? Lipreading is the task of decoding text from the movement of a speaker's mouth. Traditional approaches separated the problem into two stages: designing or learning visual features, and prediction. More recent deep lipreading approaches are end-to-end trainable (Wand et al., 2016; Chung & Zisserman, 2016a). All existing works, however, perform only word classification, not sentence-level sequence prediction.

PR Home Tech Games Apps Computing Auto Phones Problems Reviews Trending Updates iPhone 8 OLED display dreams after iPad Pro 10.9 rumors By Alan Ng - Nov 13, 2016 For those who are already looking forward to the iPhone 8, there has been some very exciting rumors developing over the weekend. Namely, Apple’s proposed plans to introduce a bigger iPad Pro 10.9-inch model to the world in 2017, one which would have a redesigned display screen. This display is thought to be an edge-to-edge or bezel-free screen display with no physical home button. The rumors have come from Barclays Research analysts citing sources from within Apple’s supply chain in Asia. These details are exciting, as it could be the first insight into the Apple iPhone 8 screen which could incorporate the same features. Additional information revealed by MacRumors also suggest that the iPhone 8 would come in 5.8-inch and 5-inch variants, with the 5.8-inch being the premium version featuring an OLED display. Just take that in for a second as you consider the current iPhone 7 for sale, or what you’ve just upgraded to. The iPhone 8 could be the biggest upgrade we’ve seen in years, with edge-to-edge, no home screen, some curved technology and OLED? It sounds too good to be true, but let’s wait and see what happens. Would this be the perfect upgrade for you? Give us your thoughts below. Follow us on Facebook, Twitter or Google Plus.

But according to a new report, they have also pocketed wages and benefits from workers and even sued them for changing jobs, and apparently, many big-name tech companies—including Cisco, Verizon, Apple, Google and eBay—have turned a blind eye to the abuses. According to the report, which was released by The Center of Investigative Reporting (CIR), The Guardian, and NBC Bay Area’s Investigative Unit, these labor brokers have often charged workers the cost of a visa and didn’t have a job waiting for them when they arrived, both of which are prohibited by visa rules. And in some cases, when workers arrived in the U.S., the account goes, they were “benched”—placed in a guesthouse with subpar living conditions and asked to post exaggerated resumes online. Then, when workers received jobs, the report claims, the body shops who hired them collected a cut of their salary. The authors of the investigation probed this migrant worker problem for a year, speaking to thousands of Indian tech workers both on and off the record. They found abuses in Silicon Valley, as well as other parts of the U.S. One worker described it as an “ecosystem of fear.” According to the report, Cisco, Verizon, Apple, Google, eBay, and some branches of the federal government use these labor brokers—through others, notably Facebook, shun them. “Why a more comprehensive job of cracking down on this wasn’t done, given that it seems there were violations of the law at pretty much every juncture—that’s the basic question we hope our work asked,” Matt Smith, one of the authors, tells WIRED. Using these brokers, technology companies can staff up their workforce more quickly, without having to deal with procedural delays. And, in theory, foreign tech workers can benefit, too: if they were already looking to move to the U.S., signing on with a consulting firm who matches them up with an open position can be less stressful than having to go out and do an extensive job search themselves. But reviewing court filings involving more than 600 fraudulent H-1B visas, investigators found a more convoluted story. From 2000 to 2013, according to the report and documents filed with the U.S. Department of Labor, at least $29.7m was illegally withheld from 4,400 technology workers who migrated to the U.S. on H-1B visas. Other contract labor firms also forced workers to pay large fines or served them up with lawsuits if they didn’t stick to the unfair terms of their contracts, the report says, and when the job brokers were caught and shut down, they sometimes resurfaced with a different name and the same address. The abuse doesn’t just hurt the workers. It breaks the system that’s in place. Because of a national cap, only 65,000 H-1B visas are handed out to foreigners every year, and labor contract firms in the business of breaking the rules can steal spots that others may need and deserve. One reason the abuse appears to continue, the investigators behind the report found, is that resources are limited. Those in charge of catching visa abuses, they say, are often focused on more vulnerable populations or blue collar workers. Go Back to Top.

About Us Contact HOME Financials Technology Consumer Discretionary Healthcare Energy Gaming Search Technology Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) Tipped To Refresh Its Most Popular MacBook Offering: Report Published By Blake Audett at November 12, 2016 08:25 am Last month, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) made big waves in the tech world with the release of its new and shiny models of the MacBook Pro. However, the Cupertino-based tech giant did not reveal a refreshed line of its MacBook Air which led users to believe that the company is on the path of discontinuing its entry-level notebook offering. Interestingly, a new publication from the International Business Times AU notes that Apple is still looking to refresh its current-generation MacBook Air. Even though the 13-inch model of the new MacBook Pro is slimmer and lighter than the current MacBook Air but MacBook users were still left devastated when they found out that the company could potentially discontinue one of its most popular and certainly cheapest notebook offering. Hence, Apple would not want to risk upsetting its users, so the arrival of the much-discussed MacBook Air 2017 is still on the cards. MacBook Air 2017: International Business Times AU states that the first thing that users can expect from the nex-generation MacBook Air is that the device should be slightly thinner and lighter, compared to the new models of the MacBook Pro. Also, it is unlikely that the next-gen MacBook Air will incorporate standard USB A ports. Instead, the upcoming notebook is tipped to harness faster connectivity of the new USB Type-C ports. Furthermore, Apple would want to incorporate new features in its next-gen MacBook Air, similar to the Touch Bar introduced on the new MacBook Pro. There are rumors that the upcoming notebook could sport an E-ink keyboard, designed by Sonder Design, which could help the device stand apart from its competition. It would be highly welcomed if the next-generation MacBook Air arrives with the latest Intel Kaby Lake processing chipset, but nothing is confirmed regarding this aspect. Unfortunately, Apple continues to remain secretive regarding its upcoming projects which make it tough to assess what its next MacBook Air notebook will feature. Hopefully, the Cupertino company has lined up a host of surprises in an updated version of its most popular notebook offering, ever.  Stay tuned for more updates regarding Apple’s upcoming projects.

Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp and Snapchat, to mention just a handful of the world’s most valuable technology companies, are fundamentally about communication, and have all grown to hundreds of millions of users around the world. But for all of Silicon Valley’s global ambitions, on the other side of the world they are sideshows to their Asian equivalents. In China, which cuts off many American internet services, the smartphone chat app WeChat dominates. And in Japan, millions of citizens communicate not through Facebook or WhatsApp, but via a five-year-old app called Line. The service, which was responsible for the biggest technology IPO of the year when it floated in Tokyo and New York at a $8.6bn (£6.8bn) valuation in July, is a phenomenon in the East, where it has seen off the challenge of its bigger Western competitors. "Stickers", which users can purchase, are popular on Line Line was born in the aftermath of Japan’s devastating Fukushima earthquake in 2011, which displaced hundreds of thousands of people, leaving them disconnected from family and friends. Now, 90pc of Japan’s smartphone owners use it, and 80pc of those do so every day. On average, a person will open the Line app 12 times a day - a level of dedication that not even Facebook enjoys. Line dominates the mobile internet in Japan, and has a strong grip in Thailand, Indonesia and Taiwan. It has 220m users around the world, although these are confined mostly to its four key markets. Few messaging apps struggle for engagement, but there is often a big question mark over revenues. When Facebook paid $19bn for WhatsApp in 2014, many doubted that the nominal fee the app charged its users could ever justify the price tag. The same questions about monetisation have plagued the likes of Snapchat. Zuckerberg explains WhatsApp acquisition Play! 00:49 Line, though, has shown itself to be almost uniquely capable of generating meaningful revenues. In terms of sales that come via Apple and Google’s mobile app stores, it is the world’s most lucrative non-gaming app, surpassing the likes of Spotify and Tinder. Revenues surpassed $1bn in 2015, a 40pc increase on the previous year. The company plies a rewarding trade in selling “stickers”, the cartoons that users often send to each other instead of text messages, but has also moved beyond this, becoming more than simply a messaging app. As well as simply talking to friends, Line users can order taxis, make restaurant reservations and play games via the app itself. While many Western consumers still rely on desktop-based web browsers, in Asia the chat app is the main gateway to the internet. “Perhaps in America and Europe, chat apps are often a single application and maybe it’s difficult to imagine how users would connect to other services, but in Asia it’s quite popular,” says Takeshi Idezawa, Line’s chief executive. “We think that the demand for browsers is on the decline. On the other hand there’s such an influx of so many smartphone applications that it’s really difficult for users to choose which one to use. We’re not just replacing smartphone apps but we’re also the alternative to phone and email.” Idezawa describes Line as a “smartportal” - a gateway to other services, all accessed via Line - in the same way that web portals such as Yahoo and Altavista emerged in the early days of the consumer internet and, for a time, were hugely successful. While portals were eventually made obsolete by Google’s search engine on the web, but on the smaller screen the idea is gaining traction again as consumers are bamboozled by the confusing array of millions of apps on offer. Controlling these portals can be a lucrative affair, and apps in the West are now adopting Line’s strategy. Facebook’s Messenger service this year allowed developers to put their own games, customer service channels and artificial intelligence “bots” on the service. These can be used to receive flight information, get news updates or order pizza within the app itself. “If you take someone to a messenger conversation rather than taking them to a mobile website or getting them to download an app it performs the business objective [of the business] much better,” says David Marcus, who runs Facebook Messenger and says 34,000 developers have built programs for the app. “For users it’s a much better experience because Messenger is bound with identity [from your Facebook profile], you don’t have to identify yourself every time you have a new interaction on your phone, in an app, on email or over the web.” Facebook Messenger is following in Line's footsteps Marcus says there have been “millions” of conversations between users and businesses on Messenger, but admits that “it takes a while to create the ecosystem”. Apple’s iMessage app adopted a similar strategy with a major revamp earlier this year that allows users to send money and book tables within the app, and WhatsApp is expected to follow this in the coming months by opening up to businesses. But while these ideas are in their early stages, Line has been doing it for years; Idezawa describes the company as “ahead of the curve”. In many Asian markets, the smartphone is the first computer that many people owned, meaning services have been developed for the mobile from the ground up, rather than the PC. In Japan, the smartphone took a long time to catch on, so internet-equipped “feature phones” continued to be popular, allowing text-based interfaces such as Line to thrive. Ultimately, Idezawa believes the idea will spread across the world. “We think it’s a general need and a global trend that people want to do everything from a chat interface,” he says. Can you run a business from your smartphone? Play! 02:01 However, the company is not planning an assault on western markets, having retreated after a largely unsuccessful push to break into Europe and the US a few years ago, and Idezawa dismisses reports it is considering a bid for Vine, the Twitter-owned video app that could be a springboard into the US, as “purely a rumour”. He attributes Line’s success in its core markets, and by proxy the struggles of its Silicon Valley rivals there, to it understanding the local culture and adapting its service in response. “Whereas a lot of companies that come from Silicon Valley look at creating value across the globe at line we focus more at respecting and valuing each market’s culture and localising to allow that diversity,” Idezawa says. For example, Line provides a tailored news service in each of its countries and sells different sets of cartoon stickers in separate markets. The app has not been without its setbacks. As well as falling flat outside of Asia it was blocked in China two years ago as part of Beijing’s wider crackdown on foreign internet services, although the company does have a successful line selling merchandise there. User growth has also slowed down in recent months, part of the reason why when Line eventually floated this summer, it did so at a lower valuation than it expected to do so two years ago, when the company had laid the groundwork for an IPO before shelving its plans; (Idezawa says it had needed to develop its portal strategy to prove itself to investors). But Line has been one of the few messaging apps to successfully make money, managed to see off challenges from bigger Western rivals and establish a business model they are now studiously seeking to copy. Not everyone can say that.

Advises His Employees Supporting Trump to Quit Share facebook twitter whatsapp tumblr pinterest email SOUL TRAIN AWARDS LOVE & HAPPINESS, AN OBAMA CELEBRATION SOUL TRAIN WEEKEND Grubhub C.E.O. Advises His Employees Supporting Trump to Quit Some shareholders pulled their investments as a result. Published 2 days ago Following Donald Trump winning the presidency, leaders of tech companies have been sending mass employee memos in an effort to console and comfort their staff. Tim Cook, for example, sent Apple employees a message urging them to "move forward together," while Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg said he was "feeling hopeful" while watching the election results with his daughter. The C.E.O. of Grubhub, Matt Maloney, however, took a much more direct approach, saying that if any of his employees support the politics of Trump, they may as well resign. "I absolutely reject the nationalist, anti-immigrant and hateful politics of Donald Trump and will work to shield our community from this movement as best I can," Maloney said in his company-wide e-mail. "If you do not agree with this statement then please reply to this email with your resignation because you have no place here. We do not tolerate hateful attitudes on our team." He also explained in his memo that if Trump had hypothetically ever worked at Grubhub, his behavior would not have been tolerated.  "While demeaning, insulting, and ridiculing minorities, immigrants, and the physically/mentally disabled working for Mr. Trump, I want to be clear that this behavior—and these views—have no place at Grubhub,” the memo continued.  According to a report, "almost 20 percent" of his employees thanked Maloney for taking such a firm stance. His actions, however, were not commended by shareholders, with shares dropping by 5 percent yesterday (Nov. 11). In a statement to Forbes, Maloney shared that none of his employees came forward to resign after receiving the memo. "I want to clarify that I did not ask for anyone to resign if they voted for Trump,” he clarified. “I would never make such a demand. To the contrary, the message of the email is that we do not tolerate discriminatory activity or hateful commentary in the workplace, and that we will stand up for our employees." Some Twitter users didn't take too kindly to Maloney's bold statements either, with some saying they'll never order delivery via Grubhub again.

Home News Video Playlists Reviews Interviews Artists close menu Home News Video Playlists Reviews Interviews Artists Trending Trending News iPhone 8 Release Date, News, Rumors: Flagship To Be Launched September 2017? Joe BacaronNov 13, 2016 10:45 AM EST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Credit: YouTube Screenshot The iPhone 8 news and rumors have intensified as 2016 comes to a close since people anticipate that it's going to be a very special mobile phone indeed considering that next year would be the 10th anniversary of the iPhone. There are a number of news and rumors on the iPhone 8 and while the company has not really confirmed anything, everybody seems to be in agreement that the flagship will launch next year, specifically in September. Nobody will dispute that the iPhone 8 release date will be next year, considering that 2017 is the 10th anniversary of the iPhone. There's no better time for Apple to unveil what could be the most impressive device yet under the brand. Already the rumors are claiming that the iPhone 8 will feature a curved AMOLED display just like the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. On this aspect, Apple reportedly partnered with Sharp to supply the OLED display for the iPhone 8. The screen size is also reported to be 5.8 inches, although fans are clamoring for a 5-inch display for a long time. But it's speculated that that size is reserved for the iPhone 8 Plus, with the basic unit probably smaller. There's also a glass body on at least one model, as revealed by analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, which he said will be integrated into a steel or aluminum steel frame. Sponsored Watch Your Favorite Christian Films, 24/7. Click Here To Start Your Free Trial Today In other news and rumors, the iPhone 8 will reportedly feature the A11 chip, which is already 10nm and that means faster, more efficient and with less battery usage. Other features include facial and iris scanning and Touch ID fingerprint sensor. The audio jack will not be making a comeback as Apple is bent on going totally wireless. Also, if the rumors are to be believed, there's no visible camera lens as it will be embedded directly into the display screen.

Tablets don’t get the same amount of love unless it’s a bezeless iPad that is. A new rumor suggests that’s what we will see next year along with two new iPad Pro models. As smartphones have gotten larger, the tablet market has gone shrunk. We don’t see nearly as many tablet releases as we did before the rise of the phablet, but Apple hits us with a refreshed lineup every year without fail. The 2017 iPad lineup will debut as long as the world is still spinning although we could see something very special in March. It just won’t be the new iPad mini. According to a report from Barclays, Apple will release three new iPads in March of 2017. One will apparently be bezeless and clocks in between 10 to 11-inches but have roughly the same dimensions as the iPad Air 2. The 9.7-inch model will be a revamped version of the iPad Pro sans the Pro moniker as it will be sold as a cheaper iPad with the iPad mini. The other new iPad will be 12.9-inches and in the Pro class with a True Tone display. For now, you will want to take the rumor of a bezeless iPad very lightly. We have heard plenty of rumors about big changes coming to the iPhone 8, but we aren’t sure Apple has it in them to totally revamp both product lines in one year. They move rather slow these days on the design front. If they do surprise us and drop a bezeless iPad you can bet it will be in very high demand and the top-selling tablet of 2017. via – Apple Insider Tags appleBezeless iPadRumorsTablets Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Add to Google+ Add to Pinterest Post navigation Previous article Previous post: OnePlus 3T To Be World’s First Smartphone With 8 GB of RAM Next article Next post: Party Hard Go is a party busting adventure Adam Adam is a techie, who loves new gadgets and all things Westeros.

The iPhone 8 might come with , curved screens that are bigger, based on a Barclays Research note. Mentioning Asian supply chain tests, Barclays Research analysts, consider Apple will change from your present 4.7-inch iPhone 7 and 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus to bigger 5- and 5.8-inch screens for the iPhone 8. The displays will apparently go border-to-border with almost no bezels — maybe like Xiaomi’s Mi Mix. The analysts also consider just the bigger iPhone 8 will sport an OLED display. Apple reproducing Samsung looks improbable, but it’s worth noting the firm was given a patent for curved displays which are not dissimilar to Samsung’s Galaxy Edge telephones. It’d function as first display size increase since the iPhone 6, that was released in 2014 in case it ends up being accurate. Naturally, the rumours likely to come true are a fresh variant of iOS, a faster chip and better cameras. The rumours are that — rumours that were — and we’ve got a ways to go next year 10th anniversary.

November 11 AAPL: 108.43 0.64 Bailout plan for Japan Display may give Apple a fourth supplier for OLED iPhones Ben Lovejoy - 4 days ago @benlovejoy iPhone 8 OLED View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit It had been thought that Apple would only have two suppliers to choose from when it came to its rumored switch to OLED displays for at least some iPhones next year: Samsung and LG. A third contender emerged in June, when it was reported that Sharp’s OLED panel business would be up-and-running by next year, and it now seems possible that Japan Display will also be in the running. We learned back in August that Japan Display was seeking a government bailout to help it invest in OLED manufacturing capabilities, and the WSJ today reports that the company is now in ‘advanced talks’ for an infusion of around 75B Yen ($700M). Japan Display wants to improve its liquid-crystal display technology to compete against OLED displays while trying to set up its own manufacturing lines for mass-producing OLED panels. Both efforts require large investments. Samsung and LG were recently said to be engaged in a ‘do or die‘ fight to win OLED orders from Apple. It’s unclear whether Japan Display could have an OLED plant operational in time for next year’s iPhones. Apple first adopted OLED for the Watch, followed by the Touch Bar of the new MacBook Pro – which is rumored to be made by Samsung. Looking further ahead, the company is said to be testing OLED for the main MacBook screens, mostly in the quest for ever-thinner laptops.

Mark Lennihan — The Associated Press By Troy Wolverton, Tech Files Posted: 11/12/16, 3:39 PM PST | Updated: 2 days ago # Comments Having a smart speaker like Amazon Echo or Google Home in the house can feel like you’ve stepped into the future. It can also feel creepy. And sometimes, really annoying. All these impressions coursed through me over the past several days as I tested Echo and Home. I’m still not sure I’d want one in my house, but I can certainly understand their appeal. Home debuted last month as Google’s answer to Echo, which Amazon first released two years ago. Both look like simple speakers, because they lack screens and have few buttons. But looks are deceiving. Sure, both can serve as wireless speaker systems. But more significant, they serve as conduits for powerful artificial intelligence algorithms that can do everything from answering basic questions to ordering products and services to controlling a connected home. Both smart speakers do a very good job at this latter role. I asked bunches of questions of both speakers and made lots of requests. In the vast majority of cases, both understood what I wanted the first time I asked them and responded or complied right away. I asked them to order an Uber. I asked for restaurant recommendations and to play a particular channel on Pandora. And I asked them about the latest exchange rate between euros and dollars. In each of those cases, they had a ready answer or followed my request without problem. It was like being on board the Starship Enterprise, being able to talk to a disembodied computer with the expectation that it would understand and follow my every command. Before asking anything of either speaker, you have to use a trigger word to essentially wake it up. With the Echo, it’s simply “Alexa.” With Home, it’s “OK Google.” Both speakers were very responsive when called upon — and much more reliable in that respect than Apple’s Siri on my iPhone 6S, which has similar capabilities. I’m constantly repeating “Hey, Siri” — the iPhone’s trigger phrase — because Apple’s intelligent assistant responds only about half the time I call it. Out of the box, both smart speakers will do quite a few things. They can tell you how many calories are in a McDonald’s Big Mac, add items to a shopping list and even tell you jokes. But both have their limitations. If you ask Echo what’s happening in the stock market, it will play you a prerecorded news clip that may or may not have updates on the major stock indexes. When I asked Home the same question, it said it couldn’t do that yet — even though it’s supposed to be able to. Some of these limitations can be solved by rephrasing your question or request. In most cases, though, you have to teach the speakers new tricks by adding on features or connecting them to other services using their corresponding smartphone apps. Advertisement So if you want to order an Uber through Echo, you have to link your Uber account to it via Amazon’s Alexa smartphone app. If you want to use Home to order your Chromecast to start playing music on your stereo system, you have to set that up in the Google Home smartphone app. For the Echo, many of these add-on capabilities come through what Amazon calls “skills,” which are kind of like apps for the speaker. These skills can help Echo match some of Home’s built-in capabilities — like translating from one language to another. But they also give it a decided advantage over Google’s device when it comes to connecting to home automation products. You can link Amazon’s gadget to a whole slew of smart home products, including not only popular ones like Google’s Nest thermostats and Philips Hue lightbulbs, but also more obscure devices like connected coffee pots, smart sprinkler controllers and smart meat thermometers. At least for now, by contrast, Home has a more limited set of products it can connect to or control. One thing to note about these add-on services: connecting them to your smart speaker can be tedious because you generally have to add them one by one. Additionally, in some cases, customizing your device may require you to dive deep into the settings of one of the apps. For some reason, Echo gave me restaurant recommendations based on my old work address, even though I linked it to my personal account and haven’t worked in that office for two years. Changing my Echo address to my home address required a Web search, because I couldn’t figure out on the Alexa app where to change that setting. You also may wonder why you might want or need a smart speaker, even if you are interested in stepping into the future. Much of what you can do with Echo or Home you can do already with a smartphone or computer using the intelligent assistants that are built into the iPhone, Android devices and the latest Windows PCs. At least when I got it to respond to me, Siri often handled my questions and requests just as well as Echo or Home. In some cases, it was better, such as when I asked it for restaurant recommendations. In addition to pointing me to the top restaurants, Siri went on to ask me if I wanted to call them or if I needed directions, something neither the Echo or Home did. In other cases, it was worse. Unlike with the Echo and Home, I couldn’t get Siri to play a particular station on Pandora. And there’s another thing to consider when it comes to Echo and Home, and that’s privacy. It’s that factor that’s dissuaded me from having one of these devices in my house in the past. Both devices work by listening for your voice at all times, something that just feels creepy. Both promise to keep only what you say immediately before and after your trigger word or phrase, but I worry about them listening in — even innocently — on my private conversations and moments. When it comes to privacy, Google in particular hasn’t always been upfront about its practices or even kept the promises it’s made to consumers; it’s been investigated by the FTC multiple times and had to pay a $22.5 million fine a few years ago. And both it and Amazon have an interest in collecting and keeping as much data as possible on their customers for marketing purposes. And both companies keep a record of all questions and requests users make through their smart speakers. So, as cool as I think it is to have an intelligent assistant only a catchphrase away, I’m not convinced yet that I need or want one. I hope that’s OK, Google. Subscribe to Home Delivery and SAVE!

Screen Rant You Are Reading: 15 Best Biopics Of The Decade Share On Facebook Comments Next Follow Us Follow @screenrant SR EXCLUSIVES MOVIE NEWS TV NEWS REVIEWS VIDEOS LISTS + TRAILERS PODCASTS TOP MOVIES Comics Gaming Up Next 15 Best Biopics Of The Decade By Joseph Allen 11.12.2016 No Comments 38 Shares Biopic can sometimes feel like a bad word. It can often mean that the film it describes is dry and perfunctory. Biopics are among the most standardized of genres, telling a conventional story of a person’s life. Sometimes, though, biopics can be extraordinary. They can use the characteristics of a single person to say something about a moment in time. Good biopics can be many things. Sometimes, they deviate from the standard formula, and choose to hone in on only a few moments in a person’s life. Other times, they can be interested in what the story of a single person says about the history that surrounds them, and about the world we live in today. The best biopics often do both, and use sharp dialogue and convincing performances to tell a person’s story, without reciting their biography. With all that in mind, here are the 15 Best Biopics of the Decade. 15. American Sniper The tragic story of Chris Kyle, the deadliest sniper in American history, is one that made extraordinary amounts of money at the box office almost immediately. American Sniper sweeps viewers up in its story of a soldier’s struggle, and reminds us of what happens to those who choose to serve their country. While there are several outstanding and intense scenes depicting Kyle’s accomplishments in battle, the most harrowing scenes come from his more intimate moments. Kyle is forever changed by his experiences in combat, and Clint Eastwood’s American Sniper is a careful look at his struggle to leave the battlefield mentally once he has physically come home. It’s these moments that make the experience of being a soldier so intensely personal. Few movies are interested in the experiences a soldier faces after the war is over, but Bradley Cooper’s performance as Kyle creates a powerful portrait of a man who suffers everywhere he goes. 14. 42 Jackie Robinson was a trailblazer, and his trail was a narrow one. 42 tells the story of the first African-American Major League Baseball player, and the strength it took to break that barrier. Brian Helgeland’s film has no qualms about depicting the scene that surrounded Robinson. He was openly stigmatized by all sides, and was forced to play when many didn’t want him to. What’s also true is that Robinson had to choose whether to lash out or remain restrained, and let his talents speak for themselves. Robinson took the latter option. He decided not to roll around in the mud that surrounded him on all sides. He proved that he could be better than those who opposed him, and he did it by proving himself. He had to work twice as hard, and his efforts meant half as much to the bigots that surrounded him. Still, Robinson became an admirable figure precisely because he didn’t let that stop him. Robinson persisted, and that’s why we know his name today. 13. Steve Jobs Aaron Sorkin turned the normal biopic formula on its head. Instead of taking us through every moment in the life of Apple founder Steve Jobs, we get three key moments, and they are framed in parallel. Each moment takes place backstage before a critical product launch for Apple, and each one gives us insight into the enigmatic leader of the company. Ultimately, the movie’s take on Steve Jobs is that his brilliance is often mitigated by arrogance, but also that he’s a sensitive and caring man. The structuring of Steve Jobs makes it feel like a stage play, and the ruthless and constant dialogue gives you a sense of how fractured and haphazard the world Jobs inhabited must have been. Jobs has often been a hard man to capture, although several films have tried. Steve Jobs does it best in part because the film acknowledges that there’s something unknowable about him. Jobs is an enigma, but Steve Jobs does its best to study him anyway. 12. The Imitation Game Alan Turing had such a full life, it’s shocking that no one made a movie about him before 2014. The man invented the first computers, helped put an end to World War II, and was eventually sentenced to chemical castration because he was gay. Any one of these things would be more than enough to tell a compelling narrative, and the fact that they stack on top of one another only makes the film better. Benedict Cumberbatch is remarkable in the lead role, bringing conflicted life to a character who wasn’t defined by his genius or his sexuality. Turing is a sweet man, and he’s also brilliant. The decision at the crux of Morten Tyldum’s film, one which is ultimately about looking for the greater good through a mathematical lens, is given life by Cumberbatch’s subtle expressions. Turing lived a long and tortured life, and The Imitation Game honors every part of his legacy. 11. Straight Outta Compton Straight Outta Compton tells a story rooted in experiences. The history of N.W.A.’s formation is one of unrest and unease, and the movie positions it as a clear response to the war on drugs and police discrimination, two particularly timely themes in 2015, when the film was released. Of course, the story is plenty compelling on its own, as we learn about the dynamic between the members of the group, and about what ultimately drove them apart. F. Gary Gray’s film features a strong ensemble cast, including O’Shea Jackson Jr., who portrays his real-life father, Ice Cube. Paul Giamatti appears as a music producer on two separate entries on this list, and this is one of them. Here, his meddling tears N.W.A. apart, and gives us the sense of what life becomes for the group after they’ve disbanded. The film’s look at the struggles the group continues to face well into their success gives audiences a sense of the difficulties of fame, and the way these difficulties are complicated by issues of race. 10. The Fighter David O. Russell’s first rebound film, The Fighter ostensibly tells the story of boxer Micky Ward, but it’s really the story of a family. The film follows Micky through his personal and professional life as a low-level boxer. For much of the film, the focus is truly on Christian Bale’s Dicky, a crack addict and former boxer who tends to suck up most of the attention available from their family. In someone else’s hands, The Fighter could have become a pretty standard boxing movie, another film focused on an underdog who wins his big match. In Russell’s hands, the film becomes much more. Suddenly, it’s about an unloved son who never got a chance to be the star. It’s an intimate look at a working family that is bizarre and hilarious as it is sweet. Every member of the cast is perfection, and they combine to create a film that is sweet, silly, and uplifting. Micky would be proud. 9. Persepolis Based on an autobiographical graphic novel of the same name by Marjane Satrapi, who also directs the film, Persepolis tells the story of a young girl who comes of age against the backdrop of the Islamic Revolution in Iran. The only animated entry on this list, Persepolis does something that only the best biopics can; it tells an intimate, personal story while giving audiences an accurate sense of the world that surrounds that story. Because the work is autobiographical, Persepolis is filled with the kind of rich detail that can be hard to produce out of thin air. Every moment of the film feels real and lived in, and the experiences of its characters are unique and honest. Persepolis creates a world that is wholly unfamiliar to most viewers, and invites us to understand it on a deep and meaningful level. Pair that with a touching story, and Persepolis becomes endlessly watchable. Animated true stories are a rare beast, but when they come along, they’re almost always surprising and delightful. 8. The King’s Speech Considering its subject matter, it may be surprising that The King’s Speech is largely defined by its sweetness. This is the kind of film that makes you feel warm as you watch it. There are no climactic battles, and the conflict is intimate and deeply personal. The film focuses on King George VI, the man who ascended to the English throne just as World War II was breaking out. Unfortunately for this monarch, he has a speech impediment that keeps him from communicating effectively. The film tracks his progress after he hires an unconventional speech therapist to help him deal with the problem. Buoyed by wonderful performances from Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush, Tom Hooper’s film soars as it tells the story of a sweet, gentle man overcoming a debilitating problem that brings him constant shame. The climactic scene, in which King George is asked to give a simple address, is wonderfully fulfilling, as is the rest of movie. 7. Love and Mercy Love & Mercy is another biopic that chooses to narrow its focus. We follow Brian Wilson, the genius behind all of The Beach Boys’ best music, through both the ’60s and ’80s. In the ’60s, he’s played by Paul Dano, and he’s just a kid whose beginning to discover his own mental illness. In the ’80s, he’s played by John Cusack, and in the hands of Paul Giamatti’s sniveling music producer, who chooses to keep Wilson sick in order to maintain control over him. Meditating on genius and mental illness, Love & Mercy is among the best biopics of this decade precisely because director Bill Pohlad is able to focus so keenly on what’s happening in Wilson’s head. Everything about Love & Mercy is perfectly pitched, and its ultimate message is one of sweetness and serenity. This is absolutely a film about the words in its title. It’s an enormous comfort, and a gorgeously executed biopic. 6. Foxcatcher Foxcatcher is a tragedy, but it’s also a remarkably taut film. If you don’t know the story going in, the ending will undoubtedly shock you. What’s really remarkable about the film, though, is the tension that director Bennett Miller maintains throughout. From moment one, the story of wrestling brothers is full of loneliness and complex psychology. It’s also the story of the strange millionaire who takes a keen interest in wrestling in spite of his own awkward body. This film is really about the complex and completely unique relationships between each character. Steve Carrell, Channing Tatum, and Mark Ruffalo all give remarkable performances, and each is asked to do something very different. Foxcatcher is a movie about isolation, and about the relationships we forge to stave off a feeling of crippling loneliness. It’s not a typical sports movie. There’s no uplift here, and there’s definitely no satisfaction. Foxcatcher is dark, weird, and introspective, and it’s all the better for it. 5. 12 Years a Slave Slavery is the biggest stain on American history, and it’s brought to startling life in 12 Years a Slave, the story of a man who is sold into it against his will. It’s among the most brutally honest films you’ll ever see. Filled with astonishing performances, and anchored especially by Chiwetel Ejiofor as Solomon Northrup, the film is careful to depict the horrors of humanity in full. Unlike most films about slavery, there are no saviors here. Some of the slave owners are more benevolent than others, but all of them treat their slaves as property, and the movie makes it clear that that is always a sin. Michael Fassbender’s wholly malevolent Epps, a slave owner who is cruel to his slaves, is also romantically obsessed with one in particular– the delicate Patsey. It is a fascinating and realistic depiction of what a horrifying slave owner might be like. Although Solomon eventually returns to his family, we understand that many did not gain freedom. Slavery is a crime Americans are still trying to pay off, and Steve 12 Years a Slave makes that abundantly clear. 4. Selma Selma is a powerful movie. It’s about Martin Luther King Jr. and his historic march on Selma, but it’s also about the persistence of racial discrimination in America, and about the ways we are still reckoning with that problem today. The problem with biopics set in the past is that they can sometimes feel removed from the world around us. Selma uses familiar imagery to reveal the ways in which the past it presents is startlingly relevant to the present. David Oyelowo gives a dazzling performance as MLK, a figure who is remembered as a legend, but is startlingly practical throughout Selma. The day-to-day operations of the civil rights movements required frequent sacrifices and even more frequent compromises. What’s most remarkable about Selma is Ava DuVernay’s depiction of the quiet strength of the civil rights movement in the face of frequent violence. The strength of those who stood up to bigotry deserves a story of its own. 3. The Wolf of Wall Street Jordan Belfort is despicable. That’s the basic premise of The Wolf of Wall Street, a film that chooses to revel in one man’s debaucheries for almost three full hours. Martin Scorsese’s film is at turns hilarious and terrifying, and its reflections of our modern excesses and desires could not be more timely or poignant. In so many ways, The Wolf of Wall Street is a movie about this time in history, one in which the rich get to the top by ripping off those below them. What’s brilliant about the film is the way Scorsese chooses to entrance you in its worldview. There are moments of genuine sympathy for Belfort in the film, and it’s easy to see how enticing his world is. It’s true, of course, that the film harshly condemns him in the end, but in its final moments, it also attacks us. It reveals the desires that drive all of us, and shows us what happens if we simply indulge them. 2. Lincoln Politics is definitely a touchy subject right now, but pretty much everyone is in agreement that Abraham Lincoln did a pretty good job. Exactly what Lincoln did so well is on full display in Lincoln, a movie that does what many of the best biopics do, and chooses to narrow its focus. Steven Spielberg’s film follows Lincoln at the end of the Civil War, as he attempts to pass the 13th Amendment. What’s so remarkable about Lincoln is the intimate look at the man himself at its center. Daniel-Day Lewis’ portrayal is already legendary, and that reputation is well-deserved. As depicted here, Abraham Lincoln was a masterful politician capable of teaching warring sides how to work together. Lincoln abolished slavery through sheer force of will, but it’s a lesson many today could learn. Lincoln is remembered as a great president in part because of the things he accomplished and the values he maintained. Lincoln makes it perfectly clear the effort Abe put into doing all that. 1. The Social Network The Social Network begins with a scene that has nothing to do with Facebook. It’s about a disconnect between two people. One of them would go on to found Facebook, and the other only has two or three more scenes in the entire film. In spite of this, the scene perfectly establishes the dynamic at the core of The Social Network. This is a film about a man who connected the world, but found himself completely isolated. He created an entire social experience, but he’s alone. That dichotomy is at the core of David Fincher’s film, and it’s a large part of what makes the film such an unequivocal masterpiece. The breakout performances from Andrew Garfield and Jesse Eisenberg make the film all the more emotionally resonant, and the story at its center is one of power and greed, but also one about what it means to really connect with someone else. The Social Network perfectly captures both this decade, and the figure at its center. — Do these movies make your list of best biopics from 2000-2016? Let us know in the comments.

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Apple Apple to launch bezel-less 10.9-inch iPad Apple Apple to launch bezel-less 10.9-inch iPad By Bindu Nair - Nov 12, 2016 With the launch of the 2016 MacBook Pro done and dusted with, Apple’s is now looking ahead to the future of its iPad series of tablets. Barclays analysts are now alleging that the tech behemoth is going to add 3 new members to its lineup in March 2017. The most interesting slate out of the new lot is a rumored 10.9-inch iPad. This tablet is expected to have no bezels, a brand new development. It’ll apparently still carry the same real estate footprint as the 9.7-inch iPad Pro as a result of this revamped design. AppleInsider notes that this is the third size which has come to the surface regarding Apple’s plans for a 10-inch to 11-inch range for a future iPad. If it is indeed borderless, the device could be considered a handy glimpse into what the company plans to do with the iPhone 8. Also Read: Apple slashes iPhone, iPad prices while doubling storage The handset is expected to be composed of two sheets of glass bound together by a metal frame, with the front panel composed of just a screen with no bezels or a physical home button. However, there’s no telling what Apple is cooking up for its 10.9-inch iPad. Moving on to the other two slates, Apple is supposedly going to launch refreshed 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pros. As per the report, the first won’t be a premium model in spite of having the Pro moniker attached to it. Instead, it’ll be a low-cost model sold alongside the likes of the 7.9-inch iPad Mini. Speaking of the iPad Mini, Apple isn’t likely to launch a refreshed version of the tablet in early 2017. As for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, previous speculation had held that it would be getting a True Tone display just like its smaller 9.7-inch sibling.

Consumers can take a number of steps to avoid becoming a scam victim.   ( Apple ) Advertisement Latest reports revealed that fake retail apps are now populating both the Android and iOS devices to take advantage of hapless holiday shoppers. Naturally, these can be avoided, but the question is how? There are several ways to spot a fake shopping app but, to effectively carry out an evaluation of your own; you need to be aware of some several information first. Fake Apps For Scamming Fake holiday apps often try to clone popular brands. Those that have been duplicated so far include Footlocker, the Dollar Tree and Nordstrom. While some fraudulent app will only bombard users with ads, there are those that will include mechanisms to obtain your credit card information, make you purchase non-existent goods or even hack your mobile device. Chinese Clones Another key variable in this shady online world is that the bulk of clones tend to come from China. There is just so much talent there that Chinese-made fake apps could literally imitate a popular brand's website from its logo to its products, down to the very last detail. These two variables should allow your critical insights to effectively apply some strategies to avoid falling prey to scammers when shopping online. Start In The Official Website The best way to download authentic and legitimate apps is to go directly to the website of the brand you are interested in. Usually this type of website includes app download links to both Android and iOS app market. If the app is not a dedicated e-commerce platform, there is usually a recommended third-party app that sells or distribute their products online. Look For Errors Now since numerous fake apps are developed by Chinese scammers, they often include errors such as those involving spelling and grammar. You can also look out for strange characters and seemingly innocent typos designed to trick users. For example, Footlocker has a doppelganger called Footlocke Sports Co. Evaluate The App Developer Another way to check if an app is legitimate is by taking a look at the developer. This is the name of the company that publishes an app and is found under the app name at Google Play Store and Apple App Store. Both these platforms also provide links to the other apps that a publisher has developed. Browsing through these products could reveal discrepancies and red flags. Check Out App Reviews Users diligence will also pay off. Take time to read app reviews and ask yourself key questions. Does an app have more positive or negative feedbacks? Does it have 10 or 10,000 reviews? These details are easily accessible within the app's Google Play or App Store page. The quality of posted reviews also matter because some developers are able to leave their own positive feedbacks to prop up their apps. To those wondering whether Google and Apple are taking the necessary steps to weed out fakes to make online shopping safe, these companies are working hard to regulate their respective app marketplaces. But the sheer number of fake apps being produced and submitted everyday makes it difficult to root them all in one sweep.

Good Vibrations Tuesday, November 8, 2016 - 5:45 pm · Reply Get rid of a few of those dildos and make room Angie. -hh Tuesday, November 8, 2016 - 4:01 pm · Reply There’s been some “slippery” language spun out this week. The real proof won’t be until the Quarterly SEC filing — Case in point, from 29 November 2006, as reported at twice.com (article by Amy Gilroy): “Port Washington, N.Y. — Microsoft has won a 9 percent unit share of consumer portable digital audio players in the week ended Nov. 18, according to The NPD Group. The research company reported a 13 percent dollar share for Microsoft’s new $249 Zune, making it the No. 2 portable digital audio supplier for the week.” Spark Tuesday, November 8, 2016 - 6:44 pm · Reply I miss the Zune. If only for the entertaining posts by ZuneTang. spyintheskyuk Wednesday, November 9, 2016 - 4:53 am · Reply Well the difference is that these organisations have and always will be, at least for the foreseeable future, mouth peices for the Windows World with little concern for the realities of the situation. Whereas the same organisations tend to take the opposite line wherever Apple is concerned. Even when Apple was on that amazing streak of unparalleled success they continually concentrated on and exaggerated the bad aspects and predicted imminent self destruction and a return to the status quo. So comparing a peice on the zune delusion with any apparent similarity to what may or may not be happening with reports of MacBook Pro sales is like comparing Kim Jong-Un’s expressed views on Western decadence with his expressed views on the glories of North Korean Industrial might. -hh Wednesday, November 9, 2016 - 8:50 am · Reply “So comparing a peice on the zune delusion with any apparent similarities…” Apparently my point was a bit too subtle. 0. Yes, we know that there’s always media spin in their ‘reports’. 1. The current media ‘reports’ on the new MBP is that its initial sales are good. 2. The inference is that this good sales trend will continue. 3. Historically, the FACTS are that the Zune’s initial sales were actually quite good. 4. Historically (again), the media reports on the Zune’s initial sales also were implying that its good sales trend will continue. 5. Historically, the Zune failed, which also means that all of that media spin we saw in (4) was wrong. Contemplate what (5) means in regards to (2). Or as I said: “The real proof won’t be until the Quarterly SEC filing” -hh Ilovemymac Tuesday, November 8, 2016 - 4:23 pm · Reply Why would you pay over $2500 for something that takes away useablity? I use my Sdcard slot and I usually have something USB plugged in. Now I have to. Always carry a dongle with me or if I don’t I can’t connect even power. This is crazy.

Spark Tuesday, November 8, 2016 - 6:45 pm · Reply Thank you. tekriter Wednesday, November 9, 2016 - 5:38 am · Reply Sure, buy a USB-C flash drive…and give it to nobody. If I brought a USB-C flash drive to the others in my office, or in other groups in my company, they couldn’t use it. Kinda defeats the purpose of a flash drive, eh? Tod Tuesday, November 8, 2016 - 5:48 pm · Reply These sales numbers are likely the result of pent-up demand. Wouldn’t be surprised to see sales drop off briskly in the near future. Time will tell. breeze Tuesday, November 8, 2016 - 6:40 pm · Reply Pent up for sure, but there is no non Mac portable alternative if you’re a Mac user, so, like the man says adapt and accept that the times and the prudts and the consumer users are rapidly changing…in a dumb down strange things count. Spark Tuesday, November 8, 2016 - 6:51 pm · Reply I am just thankful that my 2014 MB Pro is going strong. The one with the virgin SD slot. My 2008 MB Pro is still serving my daughter and her kids. I’m looking forward to next year’s version, in which I hope Apple will have the put some of the Pro back into the Macbook Pro. I don’t agree with MDN calling all critics “hit whores.” I know many on this site have legitimate gripes. tekriter Tuesday, November 8, 2016 - 8:41 pm · Reply Well, let’s see…start off with a lower-than-necessary component parts order in case it’s a dud…sell a bunch anyway because you’ve made people wait for so damn long…up your component order to what it should have been in the first place…claim Victory!! Reality Is A Constraint Tuesday, November 8, 2016 - 10:22 pm · Reply Or there is another possibility: a lot of people like it, except for the trolls on this web site.
