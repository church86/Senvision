Anthony Caruana 29 May, 2017 View more articles fromthe author AAA Comments News This editorial was first published in our weekly newsletter. Subscribe to get Mac and Apple news delivered to your inbox each week. Home automation has been one of those tech promises that has never quite been fulfilled. Apple championed the cause through its HomeKit platform, but there haven’t been too many companies that have jumped on the platform in a big way. I’ve been using some Belkin WeMo gear at my home, but it uses its own communications and control standards that don’t work with HomeKit. Although there is now available a new bridge device that allows WeMo devices to play with HomeKit. There are other HomeKit devices, but I really haven’t seen a lot of market or customer enthusiasm for home automation. Some vendors, such as Elgato and Philips, have embraced it and I recently reviewed the Schlage Sense door lock. Being able to remotely control devices is nifty, but I’m looking for the ability for devices to work together. For example, when I unlock the door, the lights come on automatically (but only when it’s dark) and the heater or air-conditioning are turned on when I’m on my way home, when the weather is too cold or hot. HomeKit’s promise is the ability, not to just control, but to integrate devices so they work together. I’m curious – are you interested in home automation? Is it something you’d like to know more about? Is it something you’re doing? Let me know in the comments below.

Rumors are still abound the the tenth anniversary iPhone will be unveiled sometime in September amidst numerous delays. In the previous week, fans have seen quite a number of reinforcing reports about the alleged features of the phone. Starting off with the highly controversial Touch ID sensor. Touch ID to be embedded under OLED display Perhaps one of the most talked about feature of the iPhone 8 of late is the Touch ID sensor. There have been numerous reports in the past suggesting the said feature will be mounted on the rear of the device. There were even some leaked images and renders of the supposed backing for the iPhone 8. These images and renders show that the said sensor is to be installed at the back of the phone. On other notes, there are some articles online that beg to differ. For instance, a reports from Timothy Arcuri of Cowen & Company claims that the Touch ID sensor is indeed to be mounted behind the display. This report was corroborated by Digitimes late last week saying that Economic Daily News cited Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company as the source of the information. 3D render for iPhone 8 back housing (via weibo.com Until now, it is still uncertain where exactly the Touch ID sensor will be located. For sure, Apple tried a variation of configurations for the said sensor on the iPhone 8. Thereby exist multiple reports of the supposed sensor location. Nevertheless, it seems like more and more reports are starting to lean over the in-display mounted Touch ID sensor instead of the rear-mounted one. Apple iPhone 8 display aspect ratio Speaking about the iPhone 8’s display, many would know by now that Apple intends to use an OLED panel, a 2.5D type to be exact, on its next flagship phone. This is something that many iPhone users have been waiting for as most Android phones right now have the same display and they did not want to be left behind. Furthermore, OLED displays offer a few improvements to common LCD displays used on current and previous iPhones. For instance, OLED displays are better in color reproduction. Most images displayed on an OLED panel are more vibrant than an LCD. Another important feature of OLED displays is the inherent increase in power efficiency. This is due to the fact the OLED displays do not use LED backlighting to make the picture elements visible. Finally, on the subject of displays, it was also reported last week that Apple might opt for the same display aspect ratio on the iPhone 8 as with the Samsung Galaxy S8. Market reports claim that OLED manufacturers have ramped up 18:9 aspect ratio display panel production in anticipation for the increase in orders this year, majority of which will be coming from Apple. Alleged iPhone 8 display design (by KGI Securities) Artificial Intelligence with Apple Neural Engine Right now, most mobile devices offer some sort of virtual assistance that encompasses machine learning or artificial intelligence. There are currently a number of iterations of virtual mobile assistants in the market. In Apple’s case, it is Siri. For years now, the company has been trying to improve on the said virtual assistant app. Apple even included Siri on the latest version of macOS Sierra. Rumor has it that on iOS 11, Siri will become even more integrated with iOS devices and applications such as iMessage. Now, Bloomberg reports that Apple is considering developing its own artificial intelligence chip to aid the development of applications in the same area. The report claims that the said chip is currently called Apple Neural Engine. The Apple Neural Engine will be integrated to future devices, not only iOS. It will be used mainly on tasks that require human intelligence. These tasks include facial recognition and speech recognition to name a few. Unfortunately, while this may sound truly exciting, it is still uncertain if the said chip will be featured on the iPhone 8. The Neural Engine is still in its early stages of development. There are chances that it might not make it in time with the phone’s release. Nevertheless, Apple, for the time being, might rely on its in-house A11 chip. This will be enough for much of the augmented reality and artificial intelligence that the iPhone 8 will have. Alleged iPhone 8 mockup (by Benjamin Geskin) It looks like the specs for the iPhone 8 is slowly getting finalized as the days go by. For now, perhaps it is safe to say that anyone expecting an in-display Touch ID sensor will not be disappointed when the phone gets released. The same goes with the rumored OLED display of the phone. Most of the rumors regarding this matter has always been about OLED and they have been pretty consistent all the way. The only question right now is when is the phone getting release. There are many school of thoughts about this issue. Reports left, right and center suggest that Apple is having issues with the production major components for the iPhone 8. Chief of which is the Touch ID and OLED display assembly. Many are still hoping that Apple will unveil the much awaited iPhone later this year. This is mainly because some fans are actually curious as to how the phone would look like in physical form. Furthermore, some analysts believe that if Apple fails to release the iPhone 8 later this year, it would mean a great loss for the company in terms of sales. This is due to the fact that its rival, Samsung, is expected to released another flagship later this year. For more updates on the iPhone 8, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

Demonstrators from all over the country marched down Madrid's main avenue, the Gran Via, behind a banner reading "bread, work, homes and equality." Dozens of trade unions and leftwing groups joined the protest. Organisers put the turnout at 200,000, while the local prefecture put it at only 6,000. An estimate by AFP journalists put it in the tens of thousands. Labour reforms adopted in 2012 by the conservative government of Mariano Rajoy have helped to spur growth and bring unemployment down from 27 percent at the start of 2013 to 18.7 percent in the first quarter of this year. But critics say the downside is that many jobs are precarious, with no guarantee of working hours, and are often poorly paid. The minimum wage in Spain is 825 euros ($922) per month. Apple opens first official store in SE Asia SINGAPORE (AFP): Apple opened its first Southeast Asia store in Singapore on Saturday, drawing hundreds of excited fans to the swanky two-storey site in the city's upmarket shopping district. Located on the affluent Orchard Road, the new shop -- easily distinguished by its iconic glass facade -- is expected to be one of the most popular Apple stores in the world according to the US tech giant. Merchandise such as the iPhone and MacBook were strategically placed on display across the spacious first floor, while the upper level acted as a classroom for customers to participate in hands-on sessions. Hundreds of shoppers camped out in anticipation of the launch, while more than a thousand thronged the store soon after the doors opened, an AFP reporter observed. First in the queue was Xiang Jiaxin, a twenty-five-year-old Chinese national working in Macau who had queued for more than 12 hours overnight and planned a holiday to Singapore specially to coincide with the opening. "I am very happy and excited to be part of this. I have participated in the official store openings in Macau, Guangzhou and Nanjing," he told AFP. Apple, which has a staggering $256.8 billion cash stockpile, celebrated its 40th anniversary last year. The Silicon Valley legend sprang out of Steve Jobs' garage to reshape modern life with trend-setting gadgets. Most of its earnings come from the iPhone, which faces increasingly tough competition in a saturated market. The tech behemoth has almost 500 stores globally with more than a million visitors daily. Aside from Singapore, its Asia shops are located in Hong Kong, China and Japan. A regional transport, business and financial hub, Singapore attracted 16.4 million visitors last year. WCCI Sialkot being set up SIALKOT (APP): Necessary arrangement are being finalized for setting up Women Chamber of Commerce and Industry Sialkot (WCCI-S), said chairperson Departmental Committee on Women Entrepreneurs of SCCI Dr. Maryam Noman. Talking to APP on Sunday, she said that Women Chamber will be operational soon in this export oriented city and hub of cottage industry of the country and this step was being taken to facilitate the business women. At present a large number of business women were registered with SCCI and doing their business successfully she said. Dr.Maryam said main objective of setting up Women Chamber was to empower women folk and to promote women entrepreneurship of Sialkot and its adjoining areas. She said that the dream of national development could not be materialized without the involvement women in the national development process. The chairperson further stated that Pakistani women had the capability and courage to bring revolutionary changes in every sphere of life and cope with global challenges more effectively. The Women Chamber will play its instrumental role in promoting women entrepreneurship enabling them to play their due role in boosting up export volume and Women Chamber will extend necessary support and guidance to females in setting up their independent business and concentrate on capacity building she added. China's coal-rich province suspends mine construction TAIYUAN (APP/Xinhua): Authorities in northern China's Shanxi province have vowed to suspend or hold back the construction of coal mines with a capacity of 120 million tonnes from 2016 to 2020. Besides cutting its coal production capacity by over 100 million tonnes, the province will also suspend the construction of more coal mines over the period to further reduce coal production capacity, according to a recent coal industry development plan published by the local government. As of the end of 2015, Shanxi had or was constructing 1,078 coal mines with a total production capacity of 1.46 billion tonnes per year. Among the coal mines, 541 have a production capacity of 880 million tonnes per year and 537 are under construction. By the end of March 2016, the number of mines in operation rose to 562 with a capacity of 910 million tonnes per year. At the same time, the province will also reduce the number of coal mines by restructuring the companies. With a quarter of China's known coal reserves, Shanxi aims to limit the number of its mines to 900 by 2020, with an average capacity of 1.8 million tonnes annually, according to earlier reports. Earlier this month, the province said it will close down 18 collieries and cut 17 million tonnes of coal production capacity this year.

Sleek and slim, the 2016 machine packs a lot of power in its portable frame. There is just one problem, however. For power users, the 2016 MBP simply does not have enough horsepower to justify its “Pro” moniker and its premium price. If a noted Apple analyst is to be believed, however, the MacBook Pro 2017 might very well address all of the 2016 model’s issues sooner than expected. According to a MacWorld report, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who has a pretty solid track record with regards to his predictions about the tech giant, has stated that the entire Mac lineup would see an update this year. This includes the MacBook Pro, which would be given a processor boost and an upgrade on memory. While a processor and memory boost might appear to be marginal upgrades to the popular professional-grade laptop, these improvements would actually go a long way in establishing the MacBook Pro 2017 as a serious productivity machine capable of handling the most arduous tasks that users could throw at it. Currently, the Skylake chip-8GB RAM configuration of the device is good enough for basic productivity tasks, but when users attempt some serious video or image creation, the 2016 MBP struggles. My weapon blacked out. A post shared by Julian O'hayon (@anckor) on May 27, 2017 at 10:14am PDT The MacBook Pro is currently Apple’s most powerful laptop, but it could be so much better. According to persistent rumors about the upcoming device, the professional-grade laptop would be released with Intel’s Kaby Lake chips this coming June during Apple’s WWDC 2017 event. The Kaby Lake chips would not be all that the laptops would be equipped with, however, as the MacBook Pro 2017 is expected to be fitted with 16GB of RAM as well, which is double the amount that was featured in the 2016 models. Kuo even stated that a higher-end MacBook Pro, possibly a 15-inch model, would launch with 32GB of RAM late this year, which would all but make Apple’s professional-grade laptops worthy of their moniker. If any, the signs that Apple is preparing for an update in its lineup have begun appearing. Over the past few months, numerous Apple products, from the iPad Pro to the MacBook Pro 2016, have started going on sale, as noted by AppleInsider. If the Cupertino-based tech giant’s reputation is any indication, sales and promotions on outgoing models usually indicate that newer products would replace them soon. Ultimately, the 2016 MacBook Pro was a gamble that did not pay off as much as Apple expected. While the sleek machines boasted numerous advancements and new features that were not found in their predecessors, they were unfortunately held back by the design choices that the Cupertino-based tech giant rolled out for the computers. Among these is the retirement of legacy ports in favor of USB-C, which resulted in users scrambling to acquire dongles to get basic tasks done, as well as the removal of popular features such as the MagSafe power connector. Kick off your morning off on the right foot. #chillmorning #classicalmusic #coffee #macbookpro #latte #bestpartofwakingup A post shared by Kevin Yeager (@the_simple_cyclist) on May 28, 2017 at 5:13pm PDT Even the Touch Bar, arguably the MacBook Pro 2017’s most iconic feature, has been met with mixed reviews from users as of date. While the feature is undoubtedly novel, and while it does provide a new way for users to interact with their laptops, many have stated that the Touch Bar is not that useful in real-world applications at all. If any, the advantages of the Touch Bar are far outweighed by the compromises that Apple took when designing the 2016 MacBook Pro. The 2017 MacBook Pro would largely be the same device that was released last year. It would still have the same upgrade restrictions, the same lack of legacy ports and its Touch Bar would still be not as useful. Nevertheless, the added power that he Kaby Lake processors would give, and the ease of use that a RAM upgrade would provide, would surely be appreciated by consumers and avid Apple fans alike. Ultimately, such a push in specs would make the MacBook Pro 2017 worthy of its name.

By Kate Sheridan STAT  May 28, 2017 In March 2015, Apple promised to change the way medical research could be done. It launched ResearchKit, which could turn millions of iPhones around the world into a “powerful tool for medical research,” the company said at the time. ResearchKit is software that gives would-be app developers a library of coding to create health apps on the iPhone and Apple Watch. And it has spawned a number of studies: One team created an app to track symptoms of Parkinson’s disease; another a screening protocol for autism, while a third tracks changes in the moles people have on their skin. Advertisement Many of these apps have been downloaded tens of thousands of times. “Virtually overnight, the research studies that we launched became some of the largest in history,” Jeff Williams, then Apple’s senior vice president of operations, said at an Apple event in March 2016. But much of that early research wasn’t clinical in nature; rather it simply studied the feasibility of using mobile apps to collect health data.

Sign up for more newsletters here Now, however, ResearchKit seems to be on the verge of becoming medically useful. In recent months scientists have published new data on seizures, asthma attacks, and heart disease using the platform. And scientists are already looking ahead to the next milestone: hacking our ubiquitous mobile devices to become potentially lifesaving medical monitors. For epilepsy patients and their doctors, precise answers to standard questions can be hard to get. How many seizures happened in the last month? How many doses of epilepsy medication were skipped? Some patients go by memory, others keep journals or charts. But participants in a recent Johns Hopkins study were the first to use a ResearchKit app to track their seizures, with the data going to Dr. Gregory Krauss and his colleagues. Advertisement For the past two years, Krauss has collected data from participants before, after — and even during — seizures. If the users think they’re about to have a seizure, they can open the app on their watch and begin tests that measure their memory along with their state of awareness. If they stop responding to the test, they’re presumed to have lost awareness until they start responding again. That data is coupled with heart rate and accelerometer data. The team’s results were the first to use surveys taken immediately after seizures to document epilepsy triggers — a feat impossible with previous research methods. Sleepless nights, missed medication doses, and stress were all found to contribute to the likelihood of seizure, according to data presented at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Neurology on April 27. Researchers plan to submit the data for peer-reviewed publication and join just a handful of other ResearchKit teams who have published. And Krauss and his team are working to create a seizure detector to warn participants before the terrifying — and potentially dangerous — event sets in. The EpiWatch app, running in the background on a smartwatch, would use physiological data to detect a seizure and alert its wearer. Meanwhile, other studies using the ResearchKit software are making their way through publication and adding to the scientific literature. The MyHeart Counts app, for instance, studies the impact of physical activity on heart health, and preliminary results were published in JAMA Cardiology in January. More than 20,000 people sent data about their movements to researchers, and about 4,900 people completed a six-minute walk test, an oft-used measure for fitness. The data showed that nearly two-thirds of participants were stationary for half of their day, and those among the least active had higher rates of cardiovascular-related illnesses. Another team at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City published data from its asthma app in March in Nature Biotechnology. Their findings confirmed that more asthma attacks happen in the summer than in spring, and that air quality affects symptoms. The size and speed of data collection in these studies are pretty unbeatable. “I think it would be very hard to do the research without ResearchKit,” said Krauss, the epilepsy researcher. “We’re able to study people in a large range of ages and a large number of different types of seizures across the entire US quickly.” So far, his team has analyzed data from nearly 1,000 participants. One segment of the Mount Sinai study included more than 2,000 people — about as many adults with asthma as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reached during its 2015 National Health Interview Survey. Moreover, the Mount Sinai study could gather data from the same individual over several days, said professor Pei Wang; each person took the CDC survey only once. Despite those advantages, ResearchKit faces two major hurdles. First, because participants register from their personal devices, they have to have been able to afford an Apple product such as a smartphone or a smartwatch. So many low-income individuals would be less likely to participate in these research studies. Secondly, research done on ResearchKit may suffer from a broader diversity problem. The researchers STAT spoke to said they were satisfied with their sample populations but noted that some “techie” cities and regions, such as San Francisco, had particularly high numbers of participants. Though the asthma study had about the same geographic distribution as the those in the CDC survey, its cohort was younger, wealthier, more educated, and more male. Participants were also less ethnically diverse. Only 5 percent were black, while about 14 percent of all adults with asthma are black, according to the CDC. This sampling problem has a few possible solutions. Mobile device prices might get cheaper; groups could donate more devices for research participants; or, developers could just make the apps work on more types of devices, such as Android phones. Expanding to Android might do more than just widen the pool of people able to participate in studies — it could also expand the types of data researchers could collect. “The Android operating system allows researchers to easily get access to information about how people are using their phones,” said Lara Mangravite, president of Sage Bionetworks — including, if the user consents, call logs, and Internet-use data. The latter could be harnessed in surprising ways. For instance, Mangravite said, since people read on their smartphones in the bathroom, combining Internet-use data along with GPS information might help an algorithm predict when someone is having a flare of irritable bowel syndrome.

(Make your mind up will you?) Going from Apple-powered devices to Google's platform is either ridiculously easy or rather taxing, depending on your current setup. Image: Alex Cranz/Gizmodo Do you Google? Good news if you're already heavily invested in the Google ecosystem on your iPhone. You can switch to Android in an hour or two and keep your evening free for seeing friends or browsing Netflix. Otherwise, better cancel those evening plans. Those of you who spend all your time in Gmail, Google Calendar and Google Maps for iOS can simply install those apps on your brand new Android device, sign in using your Google account credentials, and pick up where you left off. The same applies for Google Photos and Google Drive. Google Drive can handle contacts and calendars for you. Image: Google Unlike Apple, Google doesn't have a dedicated app to help you defect to its mobile OS, but it does have a website with a lot of the information you're going to need: essentially you're instructed to use Google Drive to copy over contacts, photos, videos and calendar entries, which we'll cover in more detail below. If you're thinking about switching from iOS to Android in the future, or like to swap mobile OSes on a regular basis, then Google's cloud-centric services make the task much easier — so your best off keeping all your data there. By contrast, the only official Apple app you can get on Android at the moment is Apple Music. Messages and emails Extricating yourself from iMessage is perhaps the biggest challenge facing those jumping ship to Android. iMessage doesn't work on Google's platform, and there's no way to export all your message history into a comparable Android app. You're going to have to say goodbye to iMessage, but you can at least ensure a clean break. As soon as you know you're making the move go into your iOS and navigate to Messages in Settings and turn iMessage off, then go to FaceTime in Settings and turn that off too. Apple's full instructions are here. If you have some precious iMessages or plain old SMSes you can't leave behind, you'll need to rely on third-party software and some rather convoluted processes to back it all up. iSMS2droid promises to import messages from an unencrypted backup you made in iTunes on your computer into Android. If you don't need the backup on your phone, then PhoneView (macOS) and CopyTrans (Windows) are two of many tools that will let you browse your old missives to your heart's content. It's goodbye to iMessage. Image: Screenshot As for emails, Apple's system supports IMAP, so you can carry on checking your iCloud emails through Gmail on Android if you're not having a fresh start and giving up your old email address completely. Tap the drop-down arrow on the Gmail app menu, choose Add account, and follow the configuration instructions provided by Apple. It's the same process if you're using any other kind of email app on your new Android device, like Outlook from Microsoft. The only requirement is that it supports the popular IMAP protocol. You have a couple of other options if putting your iCloud account directly into Gmail doesn't appeal. You can have all your Apple iCloud emails automatically forwarded to your new Gmail address, by going into iCloud Mail on the web and setting up forwarding — you can even delete the originals after they're passed on. Alternatively, you can export all your old emails using Mail on a Mac just in case you ever need them again, then close down your Apple account. Contacts and calendars As long as you just want to make a one-way, one-time switch from iOS to Android, then Google Drive for iOS makes the process of moving contacts and calendars over simple enough. Once you've got the app installed on your iOS device, open the menu then tap Settings and Backup. Choose the data you want to transfer across to the equivalent Google accounts, tap Start Backup and you're on your way — everything from iOS and iCloud gets picked up. Make sure you're on wi-fi, and the iPhone is plugged in during the switchover. Also note, that any previous backups you've done will be overwritten. macOS can help make switching calendars easier. Image: Screenshot If you want a two-way sync, which you might if you're using your Android phone with an Apple laptop, then it's a lot more complicated. The best option, really, is to switch to using Google contacts and calendars as much as you can, and then adding your Google account to the relevant apps in macOS (Add Account from the main app menu in both cases). Even then you need to make sure you're always adding events to the Google calendars (or contacts) and not the iCloud ones for them to show up on your phone. If you absolutely must keep both Google and iCloud services running concurrently, and syncing with each other, then you'll need to put your trust in a third-party app for macOS or Android. Photos and videos Since Google Photos came into the world it's actually pretty easy to get all your personal photos and videos moved over to Android, via Google's servers, as long as they're all still on your iPhone: Install Google Photos for iOS, opt to back everything up, and away you go. You can either pay Google for storage and keep everything at full resolution, or accept some resizing (images max out at 16 MP, videos at 1080p), and store as many photos and videos as you like on the web, free of charge. The process is even more straightforward if you use the Google Drive app as we described in the section above, and Google Photos even supports Live Photos these days, using those extra few frames of animation to create a GIF for you. The only negative is that the albums you've created in iOS don't get copied over (everything appears as one long list of pictures), so you need to create them again. Google Photos can transfer images and videos. (Image: Google) All that is easy enough but if you've got photos in iCloud you've moved off your iPhone then you might have a problem or two on your hands. As we explained in our full guide to the topic of switching between Apple Photos and Google Photos, just about the only option open to you is downloading them all from iCloud to a macOS or Windows machine then uploading them again using a Google Photos client. It's a little convoluted but it's manageable, and it's a lot easier than using the export options in iCloud on the web, which are practically non-existent. If you don't have a computer to act as the middleman between iCloud Photo Library and Google Photos then you're stuck — you'll have to borrow a laptop from someone. Music and movies As we now have Apple Music on Android, getting your iTunes music on your Android device is no longer the exercise in frustration it once was. As far as tunes you've actually purchased directly from iTunes, it's probably the best option out there, though you do need to have signed up for an Apple Music subscription to be able to use the app and get at your purchases. Otherwise, it depends on where your music is and how it's stored. Any plain old MP3s you were syncing to your iPhone from iTunes can be uploaded to Google Play Music instead (50,000 of them can be stored for free), or you can use something like DoubleTwist, which is just about the leading choice if you want to keep on using iTunes alongside Android for your music. If you're signed up for Spotify you just need the Android app. Apple Music, now on Android. Image: Screenshot Likewise, if you've been accessing all your movies and TV shows through Netflix, Plex or Google Play Movies & TV then you just need to find and install the relevant app for Android and you're ready to go. All these services let you stream to multiple devices from a single account, so you can carry on using your iOS device if you need to. However, any videos you've purchased from iTunes won't run on Android at all — there's just no app to do it unless Apple ever gets around to making one. Several tools out there will do the job of removing iTunes DRM for you, but since we're getting into murky legal territory with that, we'll leave you to discover them for yourself. If you've invested hundreds of dollars in an iTunes digital library then you can still watch it on macOS, Windows, and the Apple TV, but not Android. Apps and games Generally speaking, all the apps you use on your iPhone are going to be available on Android as well, though there are a few exceptions — like Overcast and Day One. In terms of paid-for apps, you're going to have to pay for them all again, unfortunately, though something like a Spotify subscription buys you access on both Android and iOS. Whether all your data (from documents to saved games) moves over with you is another matter and worth checking up on before you make the switch. If you're in any doubt, get in touch with the developer directly to see what the situation is (you might be out of luck with anything that relies heavily on the iCloud storage system). Some paid-for iOS games, like Alto's Adventure, are free to play on Android. (Image: Noodlecake Studios Inc) We can't give you a guide to everything out there, but think about your productivity, fitness, and banking apps. Assess how much data is stored locally and what's going to happen to it. If you can, keep your old iPhone and new Android phone running alongside each other for a while until you're certain everything's been moved over successfully without too many bumps in the road. You might not believe it if you've read everything that's above, but moving from iOS to Android is actually much easier than it used to be, thanks mainly to an increased focus on cloud services (even, belatedly, from Apple itself). As long as you take your time, and don't live your life inside iMessage, you don't have to feel daunted by the task.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 29 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Apple Reports Second Quarter Results CUPERTINO, California — May 2, 2017 — Apple today announced financial results for its fiscal 2017 second quarter ended April 1, 2017. The Company posted quarterly revenue of $52.9 billion and quarterly earnings per diluted share of $2.10. These results compare to revenue of $50.6 billion and earnings per diluted share of $1.90 in the year-ago quarter. International sales accounted for 65 percent of the quarter’s revenue. “We are proud to report a strong March quarter, with revenue growth accelerating from the December quarter and continued robust demand for iPhone 7 Plus,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “We’ve seen great customer response to both models of the new iPhone 7 (PRODUCT)RED Special Edition and we’re thrilled with the strong momentum of our Services business, with our highest revenue ever for a 13-week quarter. Looking ahead, we are excited to welcome attendees from around the world to our annual Worldwide Developers Conference next month in San Jose.” Apple also announced that its Board of Directors has authorized an increase of $50 billion to the Company’s program to return capital to shareholders and is extending the program timeframe by four quarters.  Under the expanded program, Apple plans to spend a cumulative total of $300 billion by the end of March 2019. “We generated strong operating cash flow of $12.5 billion and returned over $10 billion to our investors in the March quarter,” said Luca Maestri, Apple’s CFO. “Given the strength of our business and our confidence in our future, we are happy to announce another $50 billion increase to our capital return program today.” As part of the latest update to the program, the Board has increased its share repurchase authorization to $210 billion from the $175 billion level announced a year ago. The Company also expects to continue to net-share-settle vesting restricted stock units. The Board has approved a 10.5% increase to the Company’s quarterly dividend, and has declared a dividend of $0.63 per share of the Company’s common stock, payable on May 18, 2017 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 15, 2017. From the inception of its capital return program in August 2012 through March 2017, Apple has returned over $211 billion to shareholders, including $151 billion in share repurchases. The Company plans to continue to access the domestic and international debt markets to assist in funding the program. The management team and the Board will continue to review each element of the capital return program regularly and plan to provide an update on the program on an annual basis. Apple is providing the following guidance for its fiscal 2017 third quarter:   revenue between $43.5 billion and $45.5 billion gross margin between 37.5 percent and 38.5 percent operating expenses between $6.6 billion and $6.7 billion other income/(expense) of $450 million tax rate of 25.5 percent Apple will provide live streaming of its Q2 2017 financial results conference call beginning at 2:00 p.m. PDT on May 2, 2017 at www.apple.com/investor/earnings-call/.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 29 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Nokia and Apple sign agreement, settle all litigation Cupertino, California and Espoo, Finland — Nokia and Apple announced today that they have settled all litigation related to their intellectual property dispute and agreed a multi-year patent license. “This is a meaningful agreement between Nokia and Apple,” said Maria Varsellona, Chief Legal Officer at Nokia, responsible for Nokia’s patent licensing business. “It moves our relationship with Apple from being adversaries in court to business partners working for the benefit of our customers.” Under a business collaboration agreement, Nokia will be providing certain network infrastructure product and services to Apple. Apple will resume carrying Nokia digital health products (formerly under the Withings brand) in Apple retail and online stores, and Apple and Nokia are exploring future collaboration in digital health initiatives. Regular summits between top Nokia and Apple executives will ensure that the relationship works effectively and to the benefit of both parties and their customers. “We are pleased with this resolution of our dispute and we look forward to expanding our business relationship with Nokia,” said Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer. “This agreement will strengthen our collaboration,” said Basil Alwan, President of Nokia’s IP/Optical Networks business. “We look forward to supporting Apple.” While details of the agreement remain confidential, Nokia will receive an up-front cash payment from Apple, with additional revenues during the term of the agreement. The value of the agreement will be reflected partially as patent licensing net sales in Nokia Technologies and partially as net sales in other Nokia business groups. Nokia will follow its existing practices for disclosing patent licensing revenue in its quarterly announcements and expects that revenues for the agreement will start to be recognized in the second quarter of 2017, including an element of non-recurring catch-up revenue. Due to the up-front cash payment from Apple, Nokia intends to provide a comprehensive update of its capital structure optimization program in conjunction with its third quarter 2017 results. Apple revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984. Today, Apple leads the world in innovation with iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV. Apple’s four software platforms — iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS — provide seamless experiences across all Apple devices and empower people with breakthrough services including the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay and iCloud. Apple’s more than 100,000 employees are dedicated to making the best products on earth, and to leaving the world better than we found it.

This is in keeping with their strategy of offloading tasks from the CPU in iOS and watchOS devices. And it suggests their purchase of Intrinisity in 2010 is part of a long game.. While Apple was an early entrant to the AI game with Siri, they have been caught and overtaken by Google, Amazon and Microsoft. But the Bloomberg report suggests Apple is developing a new chip called the Apple Neural Engine. It will offload AI tasks from the CPU resulting in fast performance and better power efficiency. New silicon takes time to develop so it's doubtful we'll see the Apple Neural Engine in this year's 10th anniversary iPhone, which is expected to be significantly different to the iPhone 7. But after writing about Apple for over a decade the only thing I know is that predicting Apple's next move is about as easy as picking next week's lotto numbers. But, I'd not be surprised to see the Apple Neural Engine pop up in a new router that integrated with HomeKit before it was added to other computing platforms.

Photograph: Yui Mok/PA Privacy & the media Publishers call for rethink of proposed changes to online privacy laws Warning that new regulations will give Google, Apple and Facebook too much control of advertising and personal data Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Mark Sweney @marksweney email Sunday 28 May 2017 19.01 EDT An alliance of news publishers has called on European regulators to rethink proposed changes to online privacy laws, arguing that they will potentially kill their digital businesses and give Google, Apple and Facebook too much control of advertising and personal data. More than two dozen leading publishers – including the Financial Times, Guardian, Le Monde, Spiegel, Telegraph, Daily Mail and Les Echoes – have signed a letter to the European parliament, which is deliberating proposals to tighten up how data is gathered and used by web companies. The publishers argue that new regulations relating to “cookies” – small files that remember users’ digital habits therefore allowing the targeting of relevant ads – could cut off their ability to build digital revenue. Currently, when users visit an individual website or app they are asked if they will consent to a cookietracking them. Under the European commission’s plans, consumers will in the future instead be asked to make a single choice to accept, or reject, cookies from all websites and apps only on one single occasion on their phone or browser. Publishers argue that creating a single “switch” will most likely result in consumers taking the simplest route of opting out of all cookies, leaving them with scant information to support their targeted advertising models. In turn, this would leave the few digital giants used by most consumers to access the web, and those like Facebook that have their own giant data mining capability, in control. “Given that 90% of [digital] usage across Europe is concentrated in the hands of just four companies: Google, Apple, Microsoft and Mozilla, this [proposal]... has the potential to exacerbate the asymmetry of power between individual publishers and these global digital gateways,” the letter says. “The current ePrivacy proposals will result in the data of European digital citizens being concentrated in the hands of a few global companies, as a result of which digital citizens will become less protected. It will give those global companies a tighter grip on the personal data of European digital citizens.” Under the proposals, publishers would be allowed to lobby consumers to go into their settings and unblock individual sites and “white list” them, but news organisations believe that in practice this would prove to be an extremely difficult task. The proposal has been compared to the ad-blocking battle in which publishers ask the increasing number of those who use the software to turn it off, or add their businesses to a white list, explaining how advertising is essential income for many digital news businesses. The proposals are likely to further exacerbate the huge issue publishers already face as Google and Facebook sweep up as much as 90% of all new digital display advertising. “The practice of serving relevant advertising to readers is now an established norm in the advertising industry, and is essential to ensure that publishers can compete with Google and Facebook who already control 20% of total global advertising spend,” the letter says. “If as a result of these proposals news publishers were unable to serve relevant advertising to our readers, this would reduce our ability to compete with the capabilities of dominant digital platforms for digital advertising revenues, ultimately undermining our ability to invest in high quality journalism across Europe,” the letter says. In recent months, Google, which owns YouTube, and Facebook have faced a barrage of criticism for allowing ads to run next to inappropriate content such as extremist videos. The companies have also faced a number of issues that have hurt their previously unquestioned ability to accurately target ads, such as brands being charged for ads viewed by “bots”, computer programmes mimicking an internet user, and Facebook admitting to a number of measurement errors. “The Commission’s ePrivacy proposals will make it more difficult to ensure transparency ... and remove any distinction between publishers who place a high value on trust of their users, and those who do not,” the publishers’ letter says. However, the bad press has so far failed to dent their popularity with advertisers with Google and Facebook enjoying a near duopoly of control of the £11bn UK digital advertising market. Publishers say that they support the overall objective of the draft “ePrivacy” regulation, which they say has the “potential to clean up the digital economy”, but they need to compete on a fair playing field. “Citizens are rightly concerned about the use of their personal data by third-party companies of whom they have never heard, and have no idea about the role that they play in their digital lives online,” the letter says. “[But] the commission’s proposals threaten to prevent news organisations from delivering basic functionality such as the marketing of products and services, the tailoring of news products to the needs and desires of news consumers, and relevant and acceptable advertising.” Topics Privacy & the media Privacy news Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content most viewed The Guardian back to top home US politics world opinion sports soccer tech arts lifestyle fashion business travel environment all sections close home US politics world UK europe americas asia middle east africa australia cities development opinion sports soccer MLS NFL MLB NBA NHL soccer live scores tables competitions results fixtures clubs tech arts movies tv & radio music games books art & design stage classical lifestyle food recipes health & fitness love & sex family women home & garden fashion business economics sustainable business diversity & equality in business small business travel USA europe UK environment climate change wildlife energy pollution science media selected crosswords blog editor quick cryptic prize quiptic genius speedy everyman azed weekend video Media › Privacy & the media back to top UK UK politics education media society law scotland more become a supporter make a contribution Facebook Twitter jobs guardian labs subscribe all topics all contributors solve technical issue about us advertise with us contact us work for us complaints & corrections terms & conditions privacy policy cookie policy securedrop © 2017 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Apple Evan Selleck Contributing Editor | May 28, 2017 1 shares 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0               At the beginning of June, Apple is going to host its latest Worldwide Developers Conference and going to announce new things. While iOS is going to (probably) take the lion's share of time on stage, the company has also launched new and updated platforms over the years. macOS got revitalized with a name change recently, and now there's watchOS and tvOS to really add to the mix. Basically, Apple has a platform for just about everything now, and developers still play a huge role in making those platforms as popular as they are. WWDC's keynote is always buys, with Apple executives taking the stage as well as other company employees getting some time up there to talk about whatever it is they're bringing to Apple's devices and platforms. This year won't be any different. There haven't been a lot of rumors about what the company is going to bring to the newest versions of its platforms, but there does seem to be a feeling that at least iOS 11 is going to see some big changes. So, obviously, it's about time I ask all of you what you want to see. I'll just get this out of the way: As long as Apple doesn't change Control Center all that much, aside from maybe letting me change the bottom row of quick launch apps (I really don't want the calculator down there anymore), and adding some more 3D Touch options (I am trying to use this feature more often), I will be a happy camper. And while I think it's about time that iOS allowed users to change their default apps, I don't think that's going to happen so I'm not going to get caught up on it too much. It's a strange thing, at least it feels like it, with only a little week left to go before a new version of a major platform is revealed, that I don't really have anything I feel is desperately needed. It does make it a little exciting, though, considering the rumor mill has been pretty quiet on this front, so whatever Apple does announce might actually be a surprise for once. Or maybe the rumors are quiet because there's not much to talk about. That's almost depressing. Anyway, I'm more curious to hear what you might have to say about Apple's mobile operating system. That includes from both sides of the camp: The iOS users out there and the folks who aren't using Apple's platform. For the former group, what do you want to see Apple add to the mobile OS you use every day? What could make iOS 11 the best version of Apple's platform to date in your opinion? And for those of you out there who have stayed away from iOS, or maybe who have used it in the past and switched away, what do you think Apple could bring to iOS that would get you to switch over or come back? Anything at all? Let me know! Apple iOS 11 WWDC WWDC 2017 Worldwide Developers Conference Apple Next ArticleLTE connectivity is a welcomed addition to the Surface Pro Don't forget to VOTE!

Checkerboarding, upscaling, temporal anti-aliasing, dynamic resolution. Let's give credit where it's due: at its best, PlayStation 4 Pro's utilisation of these techniques produces some impressive results for 4K displays - no mean feat considering that the Pro's GPU is relatively underpowered compared to today's mainstream PC graphics hardware. And this led us to wonder - what if those techniques were rolled out in the PC space? Could the cost of admission to the world of 4K gaming drop dramatically if the techniques championed by Sony worked just as effectively for PC gamers? EuroGamer Report: More than half of streaming users are sharing their passwords There’s no denying that the television landscape is changing the days, with cable TV putting up dismal numbers (their worst ever, actually). But as more people migrate to streaming video, the scenery there is changing as well. Nearly 3 out of every 4 (72% exactly) Americans who have cable also have access to at least one streaming service and 8% of cable subscribers plan to eliminate their service in the next year. But that doesn’t necessarily mean they’re paying for their streaming service. Streaming Observer A year of Google & Apple maps Shortly after I published my Cartography Comparison last June, I noticed Google updating some of the areas we had focused on: Coincidence or not, it was interesting. And it made me wonder what else would change, if we kept watching. Would Google keep adding detail? And would Apple, like Google, also start making changes? So I wrote a script that takes monthly screenshots of Google and Apple Maps.1 And thirteen months later, we now have a year’s worth of images... Justin O'Beirne How Facebook's tentacles reach further than you think Facebook's collection of data makes it one of the most influential organisations in the world. Share Lab wanted to look "under the bonnet" at the tech giant's algorithms and connections to better understand the social structure and power relations within the company. A couple of years ago, Vladan Joler and his brainy friends in Belgrade began investigating the inner workings of one of the world's most powerful corporations. BBC Google's AlphaGo retires on top after humbling world No. 1 The Google-owned computer algorithm AlphaGo is retiring from playing humans in the ancient Chinese game of Go after roundly defeating the world's top player this week, its developer said Saturday. AlphaGo defeated brash 19-year-old world number one Ke Jie of China on Saturday to sweep a three-game series that was closely watched as a measure of how far artificial intelligence (AI) has come. Phys.org How to build your own VPN if you’re (rightfully) wary of commercial options In the wake of this spring's Senate ruling nixing FCC privacy regulations imposed on ISPs, you may be (even more) worried about how your data is used, misused, and abused. There have been a lot of opinions on this topic since, ranging from "the sky is falling" to "move along, citizen, nothing to see here." Ars Technica The 1961 Mobot Mark II had all the moves In the late 1950s, Sandia Laboratory was looking for a way to handle radioactive materials without putting humans in danger. The answer was the Mobot—short for either “remote robot” or “mobile robot”—a remotely operated system designed by Hughes Aircraft Co. in 1959 that offered a unique and effective combination of strength and dexterity. IEEE Spectrum Faster, more nimble drones on the horizon There’s a limit to how fast autonomous vehicles can fly while safely avoiding obstacles. That’s because the cameras used on today’s drones can only process images so fast, frame by individual frame. Beyond roughly 30 miles per hour, a drone is likely to crash simply because its cameras can’t keep up. MIT How Anker is beating Apple and Samsung at their own accessory game Steven Yang quit his job at Google in the summer of 2011 to build the products he felt the world needed: a line of reasonably priced accessories that would be better than the ones you could buy from Apple and other big-name brands. These accessories — batteries, cables, chargers — would solve our most persistent gadget problem by letting us stay powered on at all times. The Verge Apple is working on a dedicated chip to power AI on devices Apple Inc. got an early start in artificial intelligence software with the 2011 introduction of Siri, a tool that lets users operate their smartphones with voice commands. Now the electronics giant is bringing artificial intelligence to chips. Apple is working on a processor devoted specifically to AI-related tasks, according to a person familiar with the matter. Bloomberg The history of RPGs Computers and RPGs have always gone hand-in-hand. Even when the best adventurers could hope for visually was a few letters and numbers on a screen, what better way could there be to handle stats, die-rolls and complex calculations? Soon enough, though, computer RPGs were capable of doing much more.

This smartphone release will mark the tenth anniversary of the iPhone range, and the consumer electronics giant is expected to pull out all of the stops in order to deliver an outstanding unit. Considering the importance of the iPhone 8 to Apple, it is perhaps not surprising that the rumor mill has been grinding even more relentlessly than usual. Of course, there is never any shortage of speculation regarding Apple devices, but the iPhone 8 has attracted so much rumor and counter-rumor that the ultimate outcome of this handset has become somewhat confusing. Image Source: Muhsin M. Belaal Auckburaully / DBS Design (screenshot) iPhone 8 release dates Firstly, there is considerable debate over precisely when we can expect to see the iPhone 8 emerge on the market. The usual release schedule for Apple smartphones has seen the iPhone released in September, although this has only been a precedent over the last few years. Originally, the iPhone was intended for the summer months, with June preferred for its seminal release. But several reports have suggested that the iPhone 8 may not appear in September this year. Most of these have inidcated that it will appear later rather than earlier, while some have even suggested that we may not witness an iPhone 8 release in 2017 whatsoever. Several different morsels of information have been cited in relation to this prediction, but the lack of OLED displays could be a particularly critical factor. Certainly if Apple wishes to stick to its previous policy, this calendar year would witness iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus releases. But most Apple observers believe that the Corporation will release an all-singing, all-dancing iPhone 8 alongside two upgrades in 2017. Nonetheless, the smart money would still be on the iPhone 8 emerging in September, as a company as powerful as Apple would be unlikely to delay a major device release without extremely good reason. Branding confusion There has also been some disagreement over whether or not the next generation iPhone will even be branded as the iPhone 8. It is possible that Apple could acknowledge the tenth anniversary of the iPhone series by naming this smartphone the iPhone X; the X signifying the Roman numeral for 10. Other reports have indicated that Apple will resist the temptation to release a revolutionary iPhone 8, and will instead follow its usual release schedule with two iPhone 7S units. This goes against the grain of many reports on the matter, which generally suggest that we should expect to see an iPhone 8 before the year is out. Design differences The potential design of the iPhone 8 has also led to numerous different interpretations. There is a general consensus that Apple will slim down the bezels included in the iPhone 8, in order to increase the screen real estate. But there are many differing opinions on precisely how the design of this smartphone will ultimately turn out. Many reports have suggested that Apple will produce a curved screen iPhone for the first time when the iPhone 8 is released, but this has not been the case with all leaks. For example, a new leaked video suggests that the next gen iPhone will be very much a flatscreen device, and that Apple will eschew the temptation to follow Samsung in producing curved screen units. There has also been discord over whether Apple will increase the screen size of the iPhone 8 relative to previous releases. Some suggest that the smartphone will be a compact unit, but that it will only feature a 5.5-inch display, identical in size to that of the existing iPhone 7 Plus. But other reports have indicated that the iPhone 8 will feature a 5.8-inch screen that will be the largest ever included in an Apple release. Resolution There is undoubtedly pressure on Apple to increase the resolution included in the iPhone 8, particularly if it intends to increase the display size. Samsung is also rumored to be considering including 4K resolution in the forthcoming Galaxy Note 8, and this would rather leave the iPhone series behind, should the consumer electronics behemoth stick to merely full HD. Thus, some reports have suggested that Apple will deliver quad HD resolution with the iPhone 8, even if it chooses to freeze the screen resolution in both the accompanying iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus releases. But with Apple reluctant to cram excessive specs into these devices unless it deems it to be absolutely necessary, it has been suggested elsewhere that this will simply be a full HD smartphone. It would be disappointing if Apple were not to increase the resolution included in the iPhone 8, but we know from previous device releases that the Cupertino-based company will never follow the trends of the industry blindly. So don’t be surprised if the iPhone 8 does not deliver quad HD resolution. Apple secrecy The confusion over the iPhone 8 is exacerbated by the fact that Apple is particularly secretive when it comes to its device releases. This tends to provoke a climate of speculation, and this has already been rather rampant with the iPhone 8. Additionally, Apple is releasing the iPhone 8 – if indeed it does choose to do so – into an increasingly complex and challenging technology climate. The reality is that smartphones are delivering diminishing returns in terms of functionality, and thus there is now a requirement for the biggest players in the industry to diligently consider what should and should not be included in any particular release. The days of completely blowing away consumers with amazing new features are probably over, at least until virtual reality and augmented reality become mainstream. This means that there will be room for considerable speculation regarding the iPhone 8 in the coming weeks, and the confusion is not likely to lift until Apple finally unveils the device.

A recent Bank of America Corp (NYSE: BAC)/Merrill Lynch report titled "Occupy Silicon Valley" shows that tech firms Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) valuations are higher than the GDP of every U.S. city besides Los Angeles and New York, and Apple is quickly gaining on L.A. While these figures do not mean these companies are actually worth more than those cities, it does present a relevant conversation about the sheer size and influence these firms have. Apple and Google essentially operate as their own countries, with massive power; their decisions have huge implications on the market and how citizens operate, communicate and conduct daily lives. Here at Benzinga, we wanted to take it a step further and see how these two tech giants stack up against countries worldwide, comparing Market Cap against GDP. Apple And Google Vs. The World (Figures In Millions) Apple’s market cap is current just north of $796 billion, which would put it as the 17th most valuable country in the world, just ahead of the Netherlands, when compared to current World Bank data on global GDP. Google would rank as the 19th most valuable country in the world, ahead of international finance hub Switzerland, at a $672 billion valuation. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) would rank as the 25th biggest country in the world, just behind Poland, with a $467 billion market cap. While these are not apples-to-apples comparisons, it is the best way to gauge the sheer size the tech industry has amassed in the United States. With the presidency now hosting non-traditional and political amateur Donald Trump in the Oval Office, maybe Tim Cook — with his breadth of experience, financial prowess and general popularity — will capitalize and run for president in 2020.

And if its hefty price tag is any indication of just how special it is, then we’re in for a treat. May 28, 2017 WSP We’re just a few months away from seeing the iPhone 8 for real. Yet rumors and speculations still persist and will probably continue until the official unveiling, most likely in September, if Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stays true to its tradition. While we’re still waiting for its arrival, we’ve rounded up what we know so far (and also what we’d like to believe) about Apple’s upcoming flagship phone. For starters, we can’t help but believe that being its 10th anniversary phone, the iPhone 8 (also being referred to by some analysts as iPhone X) will be as spectacular as what we are expecting (and hoping) it to be. Some of its most anticipated features include virtual fingerprint scanning, facial recognition capability, enhanced water resistance and wireless charging. And by wireless charging, we mean true ‘wireless’ charging, allowing the gadget to be charged within a range of about 20 feet, with no wires needed. On the outside, the iPhone 8 variants — we’re expecting 2 or 3 ranging in size from 4.7 inches to 5.8 inches — will likely have no physical home button (we’re assuming Apple has already solved this problem that threatened to push back production). Instead, its Touch ID (fingerprint sensor) will be directly embedded in the display (if not, it will be placed on the phone’s rear). And this is what will make its bezel-less (meaning borderless) design possible. It might be smaller than the iPhone 7, but i8 will have a bigger display that will take up the entire screen. And it’s going to be an OLED display at that, which means brighter, sharper and clearer everything, plus improved power efficiency too. It’s also going to have either an all-glass build, or a combination of stainless steel and glass, which will make it look as sleek as ever. Reports about the camera’s positioning are still contradicting at this stage, with the most popular rumor suggesting that it will have vertical dual cameras at its rear. What’s (almost) certain, though, is that the camera will be an upgraded version. It really has to be to live up to the hype. Of course, it won’t have a headphone jack, because it’s going to be weird to bring back something that’s already been removed. But at least it looks like Apple is planning to include AirPods as part of the iPhone 8 package. There won’t likely be a 32GB variant. The lowest variant will be 64GB, and RAM will be boosted to 3GB. It will be powered by an Apple A11 chip and will run iOS11. Finally, with its rumored high-end and high-tech specs, it’s not hard to surmise that the iPhone 8 won’t come cheap. Of course, no iPhone really is. But this latest one will be the most expensive ever, with a price tag starting at $1,000. Will its price be worth it? We’ll find out soon enough. In the meantime, check out this video from ConceptsiPhone showing what could turn out to be the iPhone 8’s final design.

This should be considered very much a working title, as there is no guarantee that Apple will immediately switch to iPhone 9 branding following the release of the iPhone 8. Indeed, there is already some debate over whether or not the iPhone 8 will actually be the name for the next-generation Apple handset. Nonetheless, reports from East Asia are already providing an insight into how the next but one generation Apple device may turn out. Korea is becoming an extremely important source of news on the smartphones marketplace in general, particularly as Samsung and LG have become such important players in the industry. hurk / Pixabay iPhone 9 OLED linked And Korean media is reporting that the iPhone 9 will definitely feature the OLED technology that has been so strongly linked with the iPhone 8. This definitely wouldn’t come as a surprise, as it is still anticipated by many sources that OLED screens will debut in the forthcoming iPhone 8. But The Investor publication also predicts that Samsung will be the sole supplier for the OLED panels utilized in the iPhone 9, while the screen size in included in the device will also be increased significantly. The Investor asserts that Apple has already placed an order for 180 million OLED units, which the publication suggests is more than double the 80 million that have been requested for the iPhone 8 generation. The report goes on to indicate that the iPhone 9 will feature two screen sizes, with a 5.28-inch display being accompanied by a 6.46-inch device. This is very specific, and these numbers do seem rather odd, but it nonetheless suggests that Apple is willing to break away from the 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch screens that have been standard in recent years. Industry sources close to both Apple and Samsung are also quoted in the article, suggesting that the two mega-corporations have already signed an NDA on the general conditions and display size. It will be interesting to see what parameters Apple includes in the iPhone 8, and whether three models emerge as expected, as this will give us a real clue as to how the iPhone 9 will turn out. Galaxy S9 leaks Meanwhile, there are also rumors circulating about the next-generation Galaxy S9. Again, it is rather early in the day to speak about this smartphone, but at least the Galaxy S8 is already on the market! Regardless of this, major companies such as Apple and Samsung are always thinking several generations ahead, and it is not at all surprising that the two corporations are already making concrete plans for their next major flagships. Another Korean publication, The Bell, indicates that the Galaxy S9 is already under development. Apparently the codename for this important device is ‘Star’, with the development schedule apparently well ahead of previous years. Samsung has perhaps been emboldened by its more than decent recent market performance, and may already be making plans to deliver a particularly outstanding Galaxy S9 release. It is very early days in the development cycle of the Galaxy S9, considering that the Galaxy S8 has only recently been released. But the report goes on to explain that the Galaxy S9 will follow the release schedule of previous Galaxy S devices, and thus we can expect to see it emerge in March 2018. The Bell also suggests that Samsung will focus on developing the Infinity display in the Galaxy S9, possibly addressing the fingerprint scanner which was considered something of a weakness in the Galaxy S8 generation. Based on the rumors surrounding the Galaxy Note 8, it is possible that the Galaxy S9 will be the first ever 4K resolution smartphone from Samsung, considering that the Galaxy Note range can be defined as phablets. 4K enthusiasm Executives in the Samsung hierarchy have already expressed their enthusiasm regarding 4K technology, describing it as something that will become a staple in the mobile industry. This suggests that the Korean corporation will look to move to 4K resolution sooner rather than later, and this could mean that both the Galaxy Note 8 and Galaxy S9 benefit from 4K panels, after the Galaxy S8 also received a resolution boost from the previous iteration in the series. 2018 promises to be another key year in the smartphone battle between Apple and Samsung, with the KoreancCorporation effectively answering the tenth anniversary iPhone when the Galaxy S9 is released. It seems that we can expect some outstanding devices from the two major players in the market when the iPhone 9 and Galaxy S9 hit the stores.

The Next Diabetes Breakthrough Could Come From Apple Apple appears to be developing a non-invasive glucose monitoring prototype that works with its Watch. Sean Williams (TMFUltraLong) May 28, 2017 at 2:02PM Despite improved health education and medicine, one disease that's actually getting more prevalent, not less prevalent, in America is diabetes. Diabetes is no laughing matter According to data from the American Diabetes Association in 2012, some 29.1 million Americans have diabetes, most of whom have type 2 diabetes, which is the non-genetic form that develops over one's lifetime. About 1.25 million people have type 1 diabetes. What's worse, 1.4 million new diabetes diagnoses are made annually, and around 86 million Americans age 20 and older are considered to have prediabetes. In other words, if they don't change their eating habits and activity level, they're at a higher risk than the general population of developing diabetes. Image source: Getty Images. Though it might be a disease that doesn't conjure the type of fear felt with a cancer diagnosis, it's nonetheless the seventh-leading cause of death in the United States as of 2015. Co-morbidities caused from diabetes (e.g., high blood pressure, kidney disease, strike, and high cholesterol) can make life for those who have this disease quite unpleasant. It can also be painful on the wallet, with direct medical costs of $176 billion and indirect costs of $69 billion from reduced worker productivity as of 2012. As such, it's no surprise that drug developers and medical device manufacturers are putting a lot time, effort, and money into researching ways to resolve America's diabetes epidemic. Thankfully, we've seen a number of major advancements over the past couple of years. The diabetes treatment landscape is rapidly evolving Image source: Johnson & Johnson. One of the greater pharmaceutical advancements we've witnessed in dealing with diabetes is the development of SGLT-2 inhibitors, like Johnson & Johnson's (NYSE:JNJ) Invokana, which was the first SGLT-2 inhibitor to hit pharmacy shelves in America back in 2013. Traditional diabetes medications that target type 2 diabetes work in either the pancreas or liver. SGLT-2 inhibitors do their work in the kidneys by suppressing the absorption of glucose and allowing excess sugar to be excreted in the urine in order to control glycemic balance. What's noteworthy about this new method of controlling blood sugar is that SGLT-2 medicines like Invokana also demonstrated lowered systolic blood pressure and weight-loss in clinical studies. It's a welcomed side effect given the nature of co-morbidities associated with diabetes. Later this year, Johnson & Johnson should deliver results from its long-term cardiovascular study on Invokana. Fingers are crossed that it, like SGLT-2 competitor Jardiance from Eli Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim, leads to a clinically significant reduction in the risk of a cardiovascular event and death. The MiniMed 670G. Image source: Medtronic. In terms of medical devices, one of the most exciting advancements in decades was the approval of Medtronic's (NYSE:MDT) MiniMed 670G for type 1 diabetics a full six months ahead of schedule this past September. The MiniMed 670G is the world's very first artificial pancreas. In simpler terms, it's the world's first closed loop system designed to measure blood glucose levels every five minutes and administer insulin on an as-needed basis for the patient. A sensor with a protruding needle is slipped under the skin, while a smartphone-sized insulin pump worn on the abdomen ensures proper administration. The MiniMed 670G should be particularly useful in reducing instances of hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, caused by the administration of insulin. Sensors that communicate with the smartphone-sized pump would prevent administration once blood glucose levels hit a certain threshold.    But, there's still much work and research left to be done. Enter Apple, stage left Interestingly enough, a company that appears up to the challenge of fighting diabetes is one we may not realize has any affiliation with the healthcare industry: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). The tech giant is best-known for its leading smartphones, as well as tablets and Mac laptops. But CEO Tim Cook has made it clear that he also foresees Apple making waves in healthcare. Last week, CNBC reported that Tim Cook was spotted with a glucose-measuring device that worked with the Apple Watch. This corroborates a report from CNBC in April that Apple had a team in Palo Alto, Calif., already working on a way to measure blood glucose levels continuously, but in a non-invasive way. Considering how unpleasant it can be for diabetics to frequently draw blood to assess their blood sugar, a non-invasive method of measuring blood glucose has always been the ultimate goal. Unfortunately, it's also extremely difficult to attain, as evidenced by the fact that there are no non-invasive blood-glucose monitors on the market at present. Image source: Apple. However, Apple's foray into healthcare doesn't appear to be a one-off event. Aside from Cook's admission that he's been wearing a glucose-measuring device for months and monitoring how food and exercise impacts his sugar levels, Cook also envisions Apple being a regular contributor to the healthcare space. Let's not forget that in June 2014, Apple introduced its Health app for tracking various health and fitness data. Aside from the app allowing consumers to keep a close eye on their health habits, an alternative idea behind the app is that it may one day allow for a seamless link and/or continuous monitoring between you and your doctor. The introduction of the Apple Watch, and Cook's use of what appears to be a glucose-tracking prototype, is further evidence of this possible future link (and of the Internet of Things in action). Before you investors get too excited, understand that healthcare is a nascent sales generator for Apple at this point in time. It's still, first and foremost, a technology and innovation company that's reliant on consumers' desires for the latest in content-based gadgetry. But Apple certainly has the financial capacity and wherewithal to pursue healthcare endeavors that incorporate its devices. Exciting things are happening in the diabetes treatment space, and soon enough Apple could be part of that excitement. Sean Williams has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Analysts say cash brought back could be a piggy bank for company stock repurchases or acquisitions. Problem is, President Trump's economic agenda has been stalled amid White House drama. The proposed changes on "repatriated" cash are part of a bigger Trump tax reform package. Randall Stephenson, AT&T's (T) CEO, says tax reform can make it through Congress. "A lot of people are getting pessimistic because of a lot of the noise in Washington right now that tax reform may not be achieved," Stephenson said at a JPMorgan tech conference on May 23. "I am still optimistic something can still get done … bundling tax reform with an infrastructure bill would be big. I think it's achievable." Even so, one worry is that the overseas "tax holiday" for tech firms may not turn out as the bonanza it's made out to be. That depends on whether legislation puts conditions on how money could be spent and creates enforcement mechanisms. Rather than see the money go toward company stock buybacks or acquisitions, Trump and Congress could steer money toward job creation and capital spending, says a UBS analyst. "If the (Trump administration) wants to really drive inward investments within the U.S. there might have to be some sort of mandated use of cash, maybe to spend it on (capital expenditures). As yet, we do not know," UBS analyst Geoff Robinson said in a report. There's reason to think Robinson might be on the right track. "There's trillions of dollars offshore. We want to get that back into America," Gary Cohn, Trump's chief economic advisor, said in a recent interview. "We want the companies to bring the money back and put it back into the economy. We want them to create jobs." Cash-rich tech companies like Apple, Microsoft (MSFT), Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Cisco currently would pay a 35% tax on so-called "repatriated earnings." Rather than take the tax hit, they've kept the money overseas. President Trump has proposed a one-time tax of 10% on offshore earnings while the Republican-controlled House has proposed a lower 8.5% rate. The overseas tax-break that Congress passed in 2004 was called the American Jobs Creation Act, but didn't do much to stimulate the economy, analysts say. The AJCA taxed repatriated earnings at a 5.25% rate. The top five firms in bringing back cash in 2004 were drug companies Pfizer (PFE) and Merck (MRK), as well as Hewlett-Packard, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and IBM (IBM). According to the IRS, $312 billion was brought back in all. However, only 10% of companies eligible to bring back cash in 2004 did so, says Richard Lane, an analyst at Moody's Investor Service. Many companies kept cash overseas because of AJCA requirements, he said. The AJCA required companies to reinvest tax savings in worker hiring and training, infrastructure, research and development and capital projects. According to UBS, however, "Funds in 2004's repatriation may have been earmarked for capital investment but ultimately were spent in large part on share repurchases." UBS says that happened because the AJCA did not include a "tracking mechanism" so the government could audit companies and gauge compliance. The Trump administration could put better enforcement mechanisms in place. S&P 500 companies have more than $2.6 trillion in overseas cash. Some of that may be needed to continue funding foreign operations. The companies currently with the most overseas cash are Apple, Microsoft, Cisco, Google and Oracle (ORCL), Moody's says. While Cisco has stated any cash brought back to the U.S. could be used for reducing debt on its books, analysts have other ideas. If a tax holiday is approved, BMO Capital Markets said in a report that it "expects Cisco and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) to focus more on acquisitions, while Apple and smaller companies would likely lean more toward capital return." In the case of Apple and Cisco, some analysts envision enough cash being brought back to fund "transformative" deals. Apple has about $250 billion in cash, growing at about $50 billion a year. About 90% of Apple's cash is overseas. A one-time, 10% repatriation tax would give Apple some $220 billion for acquisitions or buybacks, Citigroup analyst Jim Suva said in a report. Suva speculated that Apple could buy large companies such as Netflix (NFLX), Walt Disney (DIS) or Electronic Arts (EA). Cisco, meanwhile, could bring back up to $56 billion in cash from overseas, analysts say. In a report, Credit Suisse speculates that enterprise software providers ServiceNow (NOW), Splunk (SPLK), or computer security firm Palo Alto Networks (PANW) could be on Cisco's shopping list. Pacific Crest Securities adds Red Hat (RHT) and Nutanix (NTNX) to the list of possible Cisco targets. Intel (INTC) is among semiconductor companies with a cash hoard overseas. Intel could bring back about $12 billion, says BMO Capital Markets. Nvidia (NVDA) and Qualcomm (QCOM) also have significant overseas cash. But, BMO Capital does not expect a Trump tax holiday to spur an acquisition spree among chipmakers.

(Submitted by Chris Gertridge) Related Stories Kentville to host Apple Blossom parade after all Apple Blossom rolls on after turning to crowdfunding for donations Chris Gertridge modestly calls his large collection of antique Nova Scotia photos "junk," but deep down he knows a handful of them hold great historical value — especially to the Apple Blossom Festival.  The festival has been held in the Annapolis Valley, usually on the last weekend in May, for the last 85 years.  Gertridge may not have been collecting photos for that long, but he's stumbled across a few photographs that date back to the festival's early days.  A snap shot of the Apple Blossom Festival in 1933. (Submitted by Chris Gertridge) "I joke that maybe I'll open up a museum one day with all my junk in it," he said Saturday. Gertridge, who's lived in the Annapolis Valley his entire life, has been acquiring hundreds of antique photos for nearly 20 years. He said he's found them all over the world — as far away as Australia.  He finds them in yard sales, public library sales, but mostly from eBay. He's uses his own money with the only aim of sharing his discoveries with others online.  An early ad for the festival that highlights some of its events. (Submitted by Chris Gertridge) "Obsession is one way to put it," he said. "I try to limit it to under $20, but I've gone so far as to spend $100 on one piece that I felt I couldn't live without." His collection began with postcard dated 1907, depicting the Gaspereau Valley. Chris Gertridge started his collection after spotting this 1907 postcard, which depicts the Gaspereau Valley and even his current home. (Submitted by Chris Gertridge) "And I noticed on this postcard I could see my family's farm. And I thought, 'My gosh, that's really cool! That's the house I live in right now!'"  Gertridge said he'll continue collecting and sharing the images online as long as he has the space. "I don't see it stopping any time soon," he said.  An apple orchard in bloom, just one of many photos from Chris Gertridge's collection of photographs.

Moser creates $27k Apple Watch lookalike Adam Westlake - May 28, 2017 1 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit If you happen to really like the look and design of the Apple Watch, but are also a tired-and-true fan of traditional mechanical watches, then here’s a timepiece that’s just for you. Swiss watchmaker H. Moser has announced a new watch that almost perfectly mimics the look of Apple’s smartwatch, yet it’s 100% mechanical, meaning there’s no display, no touch input, and no health or fitness tracking — no ‘smarts’ of any kind. So, how much would you pay for an Apple Watch-resembling non-smartwatch? Hopefully you said $27,000, because that’s the price H. Moser has come up with for the “Swiss Alp Watch Zzzz” (yes, that’s its real name). At least they only plan to make 20 units in total, making this rarer than the original Apple Watch Edition. At first glance, this really does look exactly like an Apple Watch, and even a devoted Apple fan would have to look closely to notice the differences. Since it’s mechanical, H. Moser’s timepiece has no side button or Digital Crown, instead using a traditional crown for winding purposes. But even the minimally designed face could be mistaken for the now iconic smartwatch’s, despite the fact that there’s no screen to turn on or off. It seems like Swiss Alp Watch Zzzz is intended to be the entire Swiss watch industry’s dig at Apple for superseding them in sales over the last few years. H. Moser’s press release even refers to the design as akin to a “smartwatch which is powered off or in standby.” But here’s the real giveaway: “In this watch, the now iconic model features neither indices nor logo on its dial, proving that true luxury is unmistakable, and immediately identifiable, even without obvious marketing,” says the press release. The only thing this watch is going to be identified as is an Apple Watch, and the only thing unmistakable is that H. Moser must be trying to pull a fast one on us. SOURCE H.

Now that’s some truly impressive trolling. Don't Miss: Verizon may have just made the world’s most pointless thing From the distance, H. Moser’s Swiss Alp Watch Zzzz — yes, that’s a terrible name — looks exactly like an Apple Watch. It’s got the same rectangular shape complete with curved edges that seem to blend right into the metal frame, and a deep black display. However, that’s not a display, and that’s not a smartwatch. Apple Watch fans will also immediately recognize the absence of the Digital Crown and the side button. Also, you shouldn’t be able to see the time on a Watch with the screen turned off. This is just trolling of the highest order. H. Moser even compares the device to “a smartwatch which is powered off or in standby” in its press release, without naming the smartwatch in question. In fact, the press release seems to make a strong case for an Apple lawsuit that would argue H. Moser is simply trying to cash in on the Apple Watch popularity. The Swiss maker might be trolling Apple hard, but the Apple Watch maker is making more money from watch sales than many Swiss companies. “In this watch, the now iconic model features neither indices nor logo on its dial, proving that true luxury is unmistakable, and immediately identifiable, even without obvious marketing,” the press release notes. Yes, you can immediately notice it’s an Apple Watch. “The black dial — stripped not just of any signature, but also of its indices — is strictly minimalist. On this model, there is no interface: the Swiss Alp Watch Zzzz is designed to display the time, something it does beautifully. Seemingly simple, it is anything but,” the press release says. Right. When it’s not trolling Apple, the Swiss Alp Watch Zzzz does four days of life on a power reserve, after which you’ll have to wind it by hand. Aside from the Zzzz model, H. Moser is also selling an equally poorly named Swiss Alp Watch Brrrr that comes with a blue dial. Each model sells for $26,900, and H. Moser will only make 20 units of each.

This includes the LG UltraFine 4K & 5K displays. The discounts were done to help ease customers into the transition to USB-C. Apple’s discounts end at the end of March, which means today, March 31, is the last day customers are able to take advantage of the offers before prices go back up. Today is the last day to purchase the UltraFine displays which are up to 25 percent off, giving customers a deep discount, especially on the 5K display. The 5K display costs $1,299.95 normally but has been discounted down to $974. Non-Apple endorsed USB-C accessories are also discounted, which includes hard drives, cables, adapters, and more. The deal was originally set to expire on December 31, 2016 but was extended until March 31, 2017 after extensive delays on the LG UltraFine 5K Display. Apple could potentially extend the sale again but it’s best to make your USB-C purchases today as it’s unclear if Apple will ever make the sale again.

Click to Skip Ad Closing in... Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Wearables Image Source: H. Moser Swiss watchmaker trolls Apple with $27,000 Apple Watch knockoff Chris Smith @chris_writes May 28th, 2017 at 9:00 AM Share Tweet The watch above is an Apple Watch knockoff, created by a famous Swiss watchmaker, has no smart features and sells for almost $27,000. Now that’s some truly impressive trolling. Don't Miss: Verizon may have just made the world’s most pointless thing From the distance, H. Moser’s Swiss Alp Watch Zzzz — yes, that’s a terrible name — looks exactly like an Apple Watch. It’s got the same rectangular shape complete with curved edges that seem to blend right into the metal frame, and a deep black display. However, that’s not a display, and that’s not a smartwatch. Apple Watch fans will also immediately recognize the absence of the Digital Crown and the side button. Also, you shouldn’t be able to see the time on a Watch with the screen turned off. This is just trolling of the highest order. H. Moser even compares the device to “a smartwatch which is powered off or in standby” in its press release, without naming the smartwatch in question. In fact, the press release seems to make a strong case for an Apple lawsuit that would argue H. Moser is simply trying to cash in on the Apple Watch popularity. The Swiss maker might be trolling Apple hard, but the Apple Watch maker is making more money from watch sales than many Swiss companies. Image Source: H. Moser “In this watch, the now iconic model features neither indices nor logo on its dial, proving that true luxury is unmistakable, and immediately identifiable, even without obvious marketing,” the press release notes. Yes, you can immediately notice it’s an Apple Watch. “The black dial — stripped not just of any signature, but also of its indices — is strictly minimalist. On this model, there is no interface: the Swiss Alp Watch Zzzz is designed to display the time, something it does beautifully. Seemingly simple, it is anything but,” the press release says. Right. When it’s not trolling Apple, the Swiss Alp Watch Zzzz does four days of life on a power reserve, after which you’ll have to wind it by hand. Aside from the Zzzz model, H. Moser is also selling an equally poorly named Swiss Alp Watch Brrrr that comes with a blue dial. Each model sells for $26,900, and H. Moser will only make 20 units of each.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars AR/VR Guest The factions of the mobile AR war Tim Merel@DigiCapitalist May 28, 2017 6:00 AM Above: Augmented reality shooter Fatheri.o Mark Zuckerberg’s “We’re making the camera the first augmented reality platform” was the most important step so far toward mass market AR. Where Pokémon Go gave many consumers their first taste of mobile AR, and Google Tango ushered in the race towards high end mobile AR phones, Facebook’s AR Platform now democratizes mobile AR regardless of hardware. Apple launching an AR enabled iPhone this year or next year could combine with Facebook to kick-start the mobile AR market at scale, and also be the final step towards the next great platform war. Consumers will win as usual, but there will be blood (as we detailed in Digi-Capital’s new Mobile Augmented Reality Report). The platform question Hardware and software platforms are so intertwined that it can be hard to tell the difference, and this has played in Apple’s favor for the last decade. But Apple, Samsung and other phone makers have done such a great job with existing hardware, that this may backfire for mobile AR. Facebook’s AR Platform, for example, has shown exactly how the major social and messaging platforms can play the game using nothing more than a standard smartphone camera. So while device manufacturers roll out new hardware to build an installed base for AR phones, established and startup social/messaging platforms could build a mobile AR ecosystem and user base in a fraction of the time at a fraction of the cost. They’ll also be able to leverage this advantage as dedicated AR phones come to market. What is mobile AR anyway? At one end Pokémon Go is what some industry insiders call “the best worst example of AR”, because its ambient mobile AR is pretty basic. Lovely graphics positioned approximately against the real world on your phone screen, using basic computer vision and positional tracking. Nonetheless it’s introduced mass consumers to mobile AR, and they’ve loved playing with it. At the other end of the spectrum is Google Tango, with hardware based immersive mobile AR driven by integrated hardware and software. Without diving into the technical weeds, Tango phones enable accurate motion tracking, area learning and depth perception in a device that looks much like any other smartphone. The difference comes from a motion tracking camera, a depth sensing camera, an infrared projector, computer vision and Simultaneous Localization And Mapping software. So virtual objects superimposed on the real world appear as you would expect them to if they were really there. But Tango’s time is yet to come in terms of consumer awareness and app ecosystem (though Google, Lenovo and Asus are trying). Facebook and Snap’s software-based immersive mobile AR is a serious contender, as it combines the ubiquity of ambient mobile AR with some of the computer vision and SLAM that previously required dedicated hardware. While Google Tango’s sensors enable heavier duty mobile AR apps, that’s not the problem Facebook and Snap are solving. By plugging immersive software based mobile AR into the largest consumer platforms on the planet, they’re democratizing mobile AR for everyone for free. And free is a good price point. This hasn’t escaped the notice of Tencent in China either. Mark Zuckerberg, Evan Spiegel and Pony Ma didn’t get to where they are by being dummies, and so it is with software based mobile AR. The cool kids There’s another factor in the democratization of mobile AR that Pokémon Go highlighted – demographics. Sixty-eight percent of Pokémon Go users are between 13 and 29 years old. Even though that came from a very specific set of circumstances, it is the largest sample set of mobile AR mass adoption to date. For comparison in terms of major consumer platforms: Eighty-eight percent of Americans from 18 to 29 use Facebook (two-thirds of them use Messenger), 76 percent of U.S. teens own an iPhone (81 percent want their next phone to be one),  75 percent of WeChat users are between 20 and 30, and 60 percent of Snapchat users are between 13 and 24. Spot the pattern? Mobile AR will be adopted by the young. Platforms that can scale mobile AR with 13 to 29 year olds will win. Apple of my eye Tim Cook loves AR, but Apple has been characteristically enigmatic about its plans. We wrote back in January that Apple could launch an AR enabled iPhone this year or next year, with Samsung and others following. But until Tim Cook says “one more thing” about mobile AR, we really don’t know for certain. So let’s think this through. For the last two years we’ve said that Apple is the best-placed of all major tech companies to drive AR, with its end-to-end ecosystem of hardware, software, app store, developers and retail. Combined with iMessage and its renewed push with stickers, an iPhone AR looks like a pretty compelling proposition. But Apple has a problem: Apple. Apple’s closed ecosystem is a huge advantage, but it’s also a weakness. Apple could provide the best and most complete experience for mobile AR, but only for folks who’ve bought a new iPhone AR. Apple expects users to replace iPhones every 3 years, which is a major driver of 200 million plus annual sales. But iPhone 7/7 Plus only makes up around two-thirds of the total. Assuming the iPhone AR is a range-topper that stimulates growth (converting Android users, reducing replacement cycles), we’re looking at an installed base of at first tens and then hundreds of millions of iPhone ARs in a few short years. But Facebook Messenger has 1.2 billion MAU, WeChat has 768 million DAU, Instagram has 400M DAU, WhatsApp Status has 175 million DAU, Snapchat has 160 million DAU. This means it could take Apple well over 5 years to deliver the mobile AR reach Facebook and Tencent potentially have today. Marc Andreessen remains right – software is eating the world. Do androids dream of tangoing sheep? Samsung and Huawei are the largest Android phone makers globally (not forgetting Oppo and Vivo in China), and these two companies could drive the hardware based mobile AR market for the larger Android ecosystem. But Samsung’s S8 and Huawei’s P10 aren’t AR enabled phones, having neither Tango nor their own proprietary AR platforms. So as discussed in January, we’re looking at 2018 as the likely inflection point for Android hardware based mobile AR. There is also the Android ecosystem challenge of the separate Google Play dominating outside China, and a fragmented set of changing players ruling app stores in China. In other words, none of the Android hardware players has the dominant end-to-end mobile AR potential of Apple. Who dares wins Sun Tzu’s “victorious warriors win first, then go to war” is a way of thinking about Mark Zuckerberg kicking off the mobile AR platform war at F8. Facebook’s mobile AR Platform wins outside China. Its user base, platforms (Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp Status), developer ecosystem, mobile AR developer tools, mobile market experience and financial muscle guarantee its success. Plus Mark Zuckerberg’s got something to prove, justifying his $3 billion entry into VR/AR in the first place (even if that was for a VR company). It’s a really smart move, and it’s going to pay off. Big time. Tencent likely wins in China. The potential dominance of WeChat mobile AR when launched in China is as exciting as Facebook’s AR Platform outside it. The battle has already kicked off during Chinese New Year with Tencent’s versus Alibaba‘s mobile AR Hongbao (traditional red envelopes filled with cash). But the Alibaba opportunity looks very different, as it will be the AR eCommerce leader in China rather than the mobile AR platform leader. Baidu is also layering its wealth of data on the real world, but it too has a different opportunity to Tencent. Apple could become the dominant and most profitable hardware enabled mobile AR player, scaling from zero to hundreds of millions of iPhone AR users by 2021. This could become the innovation for which Tim Cook is remembered, and potentially lead towards Apple’s long term smartglasses dominance going into the next decade (assuming smartglasses solve their 5 big challenges). Apple has been looking for a catalyst to take it beyond Steve Jobs’ legacy, and this could give it a real chance of becoming a 100 year company. Samsung, Huawei and other phone makers could do very well when they start to sell AR phones, but don’t have Apple’s inherent ecosystem advantages. To do more than maintain the status quo, they might need to invest in or acquire totally new capabilities. Otherwise they could miss out on the profits others will make using their mobile AR phones. Google’s Tango is currently geared to enabling a large open mobile AR ecosystem to drive its core search advertising and Google Play revenues, similarly to its current Android approach. However as with Baidu, the mobile AR opportunity to layer its data on the real world could improve its position. Snap is already in the mobile AR business, even if it doesn’t call it that yet. But with a user base much smaller than Facebook/Instagram/WhatsApp Status and a closed platform, Evan Spiegel might think about copying Mark Zuckerberg for a change. No dog in this fight Microsoft still hasn’t announced any play for mobile AR. They’ve got massive assets in mixed reality (HoloLens) and VR (Windows VR), so it depends on whether they see themselves as a consumer or enterprise company long term. Steve Ballmer’s biggest regret is missing out on mobile. Hopefully mobile AR won’t become Satya Nadella’s. Amazon has also stayed quiet on mobile AR, despite reports of experiments with AR stores.

International Business Times UK UK World Business Politics Fintech Technology Science Sport Entertainment Opinion Video Pictures Log out Newsletter Signup Smartphones Cybersecurity Innovation Social Media Games Motoring Technology Apple said to be working on a dedicated AI chip The company has tested iPhone prototypes powered with the chip. By Sarmistha Acharya May 28, 2017 13:03 BST Apple working on a dedicated AI processorGetty Images/Don Emmert Apple is working on a processor dedicated to AI-related tasks, suggests a new report. Dubbed Apple Neural Engine, the chip would improve the way the devices handle tasks such as facial recognition and speech recognition. A source familiar with Apple's plan told Bloomberg that the AI-enabled processor would help Apple bundle more advanced features into devices like self-driving cars and augmented reality devices. While Apple devices currently handle artificial intelligence processes through the main processor and graphics chip, the new chip would allow Apple offload those tasks onto a dedicated chip designed for artificial intelligence processing, improving the battery performance of the device. Apple's AI chip is designed to make significant improvements to Apple products. The company even plans to use the chip on the iPhone and iPad, the source told Bloomberg. Apple has even tested iPhone prototypes with the chip. Apple has considered offloading facial recognition in the photos app, parts of speech recognition and the iPhone's predictive keyboard to the chip, the source added. The company is planning to offer developer access to the chip so that third-party apps can also lessen the tasks related to artificial intelligence. Apple may discuss some developments in AI at its annual developer's conference in June, the same event where the company is expected to introduce iOS 11 and updated Mac laptops with faster chips from Intel. "Two of the areas that Apple is betting its future on require AI. At the core of augmented reality and self-driving cars is artificial intelligence" said Gene Munster, former Apple analyst.

Klint Finley Business Date of Publication: 05.28.17. 05.28.17 Time of Publication: 7:00 am. 7:00 am The GIF Turns 30: How an Ancient Format Changed the Internet giphy.com The web’s favorite file format just turned 30. Yep, it turns out the GIF is a millennial, too. At the same time, 30 makes the GIF ancient in web years, which feels a bit weird, given that the proliferation of animated GIFs is a relatively recent phenomenon. Today, Twitter has a GIF button and even Apple added GIF search to its iOS messaging app. Such mainstream approval would have seemed unthinkable even a decade ago, when GIFs had the cultural cachet of blinking text and embedded MIDI files. But today they’re ubiquitous, and not in some nostalgic sense. Animated GIFs have transcended their obscure 1990s roots to become a key part of day-to-day digital communication. Some, like Orson Welles clapping or Michael Jackson eating popcorn, have become instantly recognizable shorthand. Others, like Sean Spicer disappearing into the bushes—itself a remix of a popular Simpsons GIF—serve up political satire. The GIF does double duty as both expression and as badge of digital literacy. Not bad for an image standard that pre-dates the web itself. giphy.com Today GIFs are synonymous with short, looping, animations. But they got their start as a way of displaying still images. Steve Wilhite started work on the Graphics Interchange Format in early 1986. At the time, he was a programmer for Compuserve, an early online service that let users access chat rooms, forums, and information like stock quotes using dial-up modems. Sandy Trevor, Wilhite’s boss at Compuserve, tells WIRED that he wanted to solve two problems. The first was that Compuserve needed a graphics format that worked on all computers. At the time, the PC market was split between several companies, including Apple, Atari, Commodore, IBM, and Tandy, each with its own way of displaying graphics. Compuserve had used other graphics formats of the era, such as NAPLPS, but Trevor thought they were too complex to implement. So he tasked Wilhite with creating a simple format that would work on any machine. Related Stories Liz Stinson Here’s What Happens When You Turn GIFs Into IRL Art Pieces Brian Barrett Futurama Nerds, Rejoice! Morbotron Will GIF Any Quote For You Julia Greenberg Giphy, the Google of GIFs, Gifts the World With a Keyboard Second, he wanted Wilhite to create technology that could quickly display sharp images over slow connections. “In the eighties, 1200 baud was high speed,” Trevor says. “Lots of people only had 300 baud modems.” The average broadband connection in the US is more than 40,000 times faster than even those blazing fast 1200 baud connections, so Compuserve needed truly tiny files. The web’s other major image format, the JPEG, was under development at the time. But it’s better suited for photographs and other images that contain high amounts of detail and won’t suffer from a small amount of distortion. Compuserve needed to display stock quotes, weather maps, and other graphs—simple images that would suffer from having jagged lines. So Wilhite decided to base the GIF on a lossless compression protocol called Lempel–Ziv–Welch, or LZW. Wilhite finished the first version of the GIF specification on May, 1987, and Compuserve began using the format the next month. This was two years before Sir Tim Berners-Lee announced his World Wide Web project and six years before the Mosiac browser made the web accessible to less technical users. But it was the web that made the GIF what it is today. Under Construction The GIF was perfect for displaying logos, line art, and charts on the web for all the same reasons that Wilhite first developed the format. And because portions of an image could be transparent, meaning an image could blend into the background or be fit together with other images in interesting ways, it enabled web designers to create more complex layouts. But the most important thing about the format was that Wilhite had the foresight to make it extensible, so that other developers could add custom types of information to GIFs. That enabled the team behind the Netscape browser to create the animated GIF standard in 1995. “I didn’t ask Steve to put in as much extensibility as he did, but I’m glad he did,” Trevor says. Soon, “under construction” GIFs adorned practically every site on the web. The “Dancing Baby” becoming one the web’s first true viral video sensations. The dancing 7-Up mascot “Cool Spot” also made a unconscionable number of appearances, making it perhaps the first viral #brand GIF. Giphy.com The file format also became the center of one of the web’s first patent disputes. In 1994, IT giant Unisys claimed to own the LZW protocol that Wilhite used in the GIF specification. The company threatened to sue anyone who made software that could create or read GIFs without paying for a license. Unisys’s LZW-related patents expired in 2006, but the ordeal of dealing with the company left a lasting impression on Trevor, who now works as a consultant helping tech companies avoid running into patent suits. The animated GIF epidemic ended about as quickly as it started. As web design professionalized, those under construction GIFs disappeared. Animators and artists, meanwhile, moved on to more sophisticated media like Flash and later HTML5. But the format survived on web forums and sites like 4chan, Reddit, and Tumblr. Adam Leibsohn, the COO of the GIF search engine Giphy, calls the GIF an “insurgent format.” It enables people to publish moving images in places they weren’t necessarily intended, like someone’s signature on a forum. “The easiest, simplest thing wins,” he says. As people realized they could stick tiny, looping bits of animation into web-based conversations, GIFs became a new form of expression. Clips of people clapping, slamming their heads on a desk, or dancing replaced text, and new, more artistic GIFs emerged as a form of micro-entertainment. The rise of smartphones made this form of visual communication all the more appealing. Giphy.com “We’ve reduced our shorthand to things like ‘lol’ and ‘wtf’, things that aren’t very expressive,” says David McIntosh, CEO of the GIF search service Tenor. “With GIFs you can express a wide range of emotions.” About 90 percent of the service’s search terms are related to feelings, he says. It’s hard to say exactly when the GIF re-entered the mainstream web experience. The Nieman Journalism Lab called the 2012 Summer Olympics a “coming-out party” for the animated GIF. That same year, Oxford Dictionaries named “GIF” the word of the year. By early 2013, GIFs were showing up in museums and marketers wanted in. That year Steve Wilhite was awarded a life-time achievement award at the Webbys, where he stirred up a mini-controversy by telling the world that GIF is pronounced like the peanut butter brand Jif, not like “gift.” At the time, it was easy to see GIFs as a passing fad, a throwback to the 1990s along with the “soft grunge” trend. It seemed like surely something newer like Vine or Snapchat would replace GIFs. But all these years later, Vine is gone and the GIF is still with us. Part of that success owes itself to web obsessives, who have built up an enormous inventory of GIF files to choose from. When you want to express dismay or joy or any other emotion, all you have to do is go to Tumblr, Giphy, or Tenor and you can find a ready-made loop. You can think of it as an expansive visual vocabulary built over the years. And while newer formats might bring more options, Tumblr head of creative strategy David Hayes says that the GIF’s technical limitations are actually its strength, not its weakness. After all, artists have long used constraints to spur creativity. “The GIF has constraints that will continue to challenge people,” he says. “You have to make trade-offs with the file size, the frame rate, and the intensity of color.” Instead of asking what’s next, Hayes says, perhaps we should ask whether the GIF is the end-point for visual language. Let’s give it another 30 years and see what happens. Giphy.com Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. gifs History messaging The Web Skip Social. Skip to: Latest News.

I need to take steps now before it’s too late. A: Getting virtually extorted is scary, but it’s especially terrifying when your business — along with its financial records and employees’ personal information — is at stake. Many businesses mistakenly assume they’re safe if they have a firewall and use security software. Those are important steps, but they’re not enough to protect your business anymore. If you really want to have peace of mind, you need to take extra precautions. For example, certain people at my company have two computers on their desk. Click here to learn how I set up my business to protect against ransomware. Advertising to specific places Q: My customers live in certain parts of town. How can I place ads online so only they see them? A: Advertising to specific (physical) places is quite possible, and online marketing experts do it all the time. But like all marketing, “geo-targeting” is something you need to put a lot of work into planning, executing and refining. It’s one thing to set up a cheap thumbnail ad on Facebook; it’s quite another to build a customer base through rigorous online advertising. Click here to learn more about geo-fencing. More on this...

Is it okay to buy a used one on Craigslist? A: The short answer is, “Maybe, but probably not.” There’s good news, though. If you’d like to buy a discounted Apple product, try looking for something “refurbished.” Apple does an incredible job of collecting retired devices and bringing them back from the dead. Not all used devices have been through this process, of course. Most used Apple products were just dropped off at a pawnshop so they could be resold. What you’re looking for is a device that is “certified refurbished” by Apple. So where can you find these discounted phones and tablets? Click here to learn more about refurbished Apple devices. Stop Windows from sharing your Wi-Fi Q: I read that Windows shares my Wi-Fi automatically with other people around me. How do I stop this? A: If more people knew about “Wi-Fi Sense,” they’d probably be much more suspicious of Windows 10. After all, what kind of software is designed to automatically bypass your Wi-Fi password? Why would you want any passing stranger to log on to your network without you even knowing it? Wi-Fi Sense was designed to be a convenience, especially for people who routinely host friends and colleagues. You’ll be relieved to know that Wi-Fi Sense doesn’t share your actual password with anyone. But it’s still a liability for a lot of folks, so you should know how to switch it off. Click here to limit the reach of Wi-Fi Sense. Keep your device safe outside Q: With summer almost here, I often have to use my laptop, tablet and phone outdoors. Is this going to ruin them? A: Very perceptive question. You would not believe how many people abuse their devices without even realizing. Phones, tablets and laptops have become so ubiquitous that we often forget that they are electronic machines, sensitive to temperature, humidity, dust and every other aspect of our environment. So yes, using your laptop outdoors might ruin it. Know the limits of its durability. Click here to learn one mistake that will kill your gadget. What questions do you have?

Here are the pros and cons: CONS 1. Free trial is only 5 days compared to the industry standard of 7 days. 2. PlayStation Vue is more expensive than Sling TV. The cheapest plan PlayStation Vue has is $29.99/month compared to Sling Orange for $20/month or Sling Blue for $25/month. If you’re looking to save money, PlayStation Vue may not be the solution you want. 3. With PlayStation Vue, some channels are not available to watch on mobile phones or tablets even if you pay to subscribe to those channels. You can watch them on your PS3/PS4 or Roku, for example, but some of the channels aren’t accessible when watching PS Vue on your mobile device. According to PlayStation, they say that “Some channels are not available through PlayStation Vue Mobile due to streaming rights, and will be marked as such with a Mobile Restricted badge.” 4. You can’t use PlayStation Vue at your friend or family’s house, or on the road. For some strange season, PlayStation Vue ties your account to your home location. So if you do want to use it outside of your home, you’re unable to do so (there are some workarounds, however). On top of that, if your IP address changes for any reason, expect an array of error messages. 5. If you want to watch PlayStation Vue on your Windows PC or Apple computer, you can’t. There’s no app available for the PC, unlike Sling TV which runs on PCs and Apple computers. You have to watch PS Vue through an approved device such as a PS4, Roku, etc. 6. PlayStation Vue isn’t available on as many devices as fuboTV or Sling TV. You can watch PlayStation Vue only on a PS3 or PS4, or an Amazon Fire TV and Fire TV Stick, iPad, iPhone, Android and Roku. In comparison, Sling TV is available on: Windows 7 & higher, Apple computers (Lion 10.7 & higher), Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV, Amazon Fire tablet (running Android 4.4.2+), Roku, Android TV, ZTE, Channel Master, Apple iOS 8 (& higher) phones & tablets, Android 4.0.3 (and higher) phones & tablets and Xbox One. fuboTV, meanwhile is available on: Windows PC, Mac, Apple iPhone, Apple iPad, Apple TV, Android smartphones, Android tablets, Roku, Amazon Fire TV and Amazon Kindle. 6. PlayStation Vue doesn’t provide access to beIN SPORTS Connect. And without beIN SPORTS Connect, you won’t be able to watch many La Liga, Championship, Serie A, Capital One Cup games, as well as other programming. In comparison, fuboTV provides access to beIN SPORTS Connect. 7. You have to create a PlayStation Network account in order to sign up for a trial to PlayStation Vue. If you already have a PS3 or PS4, then that’s no big deal. But if you don’t have either of those two consoles, you have to register for the PlayStation Network account, and then sign up for the PlayStation Vue trial. With Sling TV and fuboTV, you just sign up for the free trial and you’re in. 8. If you want to sign up for a free 7-day trial to PS Vue on your Roku, you can’t. You have to go to the PlayStation website, sign up for a free PlayStation Network account and then sign up for the trial. It’s a shame you can’t sign up for a free trial directly from the Roku device. 9. When you sign up for a free trial to PlayStation Vue, there’s even more steps. You have to select your sex (male/female), enter your birth date and create a profile name. Why do they need your birthdate to watch streaming? Beats me. 10. The user interface for PlayStation Vue isn’t as good or as easy to use as Sling TV. In particular, Sling TV’s recently improved app for the Roku is much better than PS Vue. PROS 1. PlayStation Vue’s selection of channels available is very comprehensive. For the Elite Slim package, which is $44.99 per month, you get: FOX on demand, NBC on demand, ABC on demand, AMC, American Heroes, Animal Planet, beIN SPORTS, BET, BET Gospel, BET Jams, Boomerang, Bravo, BTN, BTN Alternate, Cartoon Network, Centric, Chiller, Cloo, CMT, CMT Music, CNBC, CNBC World, CNN, Comedy Central, Cooking Channel, Destination America, Discovery Channel, Discovery Family, Discovery Life Channel, Disney Channel, Disney Junior, Disney XD, DIY, E!, EPIX Hits, ESPN, ESPN Deportes, ESPN2, ESPNEWS, ESPNU, Esquire Network, Food Network, FOX Business, FOX College Sports, FOX Deportes, FOX News, FOX Sports regional, Freeform, FS1, FS2, Fusion, FX, FXM, FXX, Golf, HGTV, HI-YAH, HLN, IFC, IMPACT, Investigation Discovery, Logo, Machinima, MGM, MSNBC, MTV, MTV Hits, MTV Live, MTV2, MTVU, Nat Geo Wild, National Geographic Channel, NBCSN, Nick Jr., Nickelodeon, Nicktoons, One World Sports, Outside Television, OWN, Oxygen, Poker Central, POP, Science, SEC Network, Sony Movie Channel, Spike, Sprout, SundanceTV, SyFy, TBS, Teen Nick, TLC, TNT, Travel Channel, truTV, Turner Classic Movies, TV Land, Universal, USA, Velocity, VH1, VH1 Classic, WE tv 2. Unlike Sling TV, you can pause and rewind ESPN programming. 3. PS Vue allows you to stream content in every room of your house at no additional charge. With Sling TV, you’re limited to the number of streams you can run concurrently. 4. PlayStation Vue provides access to NBC Sports App and ESPN3, which opens the door to a lot of soccer programming that isn’t available on NBCSN and the ESPN channels.   PlayStation Vue, while offering NBCSN and the NBC Sports App as well as other soccer networks, is a worthy contender in the soccer streaming space, but isn’t perfect by any means. The quest to find the ultimate streaming service that offers everything you could possibly need continues. PlayStation Vue comes close, but hopefully a more cost-effective and comprehensive service will be available in the near future.

Youre first comment about cost, it would cost the more money to get the same amount of channels on Vue and Sling, and im talking about Soccer channels specifically. To get ESPN, NBC, Fox, and beIN on Sling. You need to get Sling Blue (Fox, NBC), Sling Orange (ESPN) and the Sports addon (+ $5 for beIN Sports) totaling $45. Its $40 for both packages, then $5 extra for beIN, and that doesnt include beIN en Espanol. With Vue you can get all of those with the Core Slim (medium package) for $35, and add the Spanish pack for beIN en Espanol for $5. Not to mention the fact that you get the addons for those channels (Apart from beIN Connect, but Sling doesnt offer that either). So Sling really doesnt offer an advantage in terms of watching Football at all. The mobile restriction thing is something but, with access to Fox Sports Go, Watch ESPN, and in particular NBC Sports, you dont need to go through PS Vue to watch the sports, it would just act as your log in. . And with PS Vue, you didnt even mention the DVR options, Sling doesnt have this. Again the whole sponsorship talk comes into play, considering it is mentioned on every other article that Fubo and Sling are great way to watch Football. The fact that this article is missing a lot of key points, and has others simply incorrect, is bothersome. Granted it really doesnt matter which you like, competition is needed, but writing something like this is, which clearly favors one side for reasons that we can only guess at, is not good for anyone. Reply Christopher Harris July 17, 2016 Velija, thanks for your feedback. I completely disagree with your assertion that Sling TV “is mentioned on every other article that Fubo and Sling are great way to watch Football.” That’s completely untrue. Some people will like Vue better, others will prefer Sling TV. Like I said in the article, it all depends what you’re looking for and want. You raise a good point about DVR functionality. That’s one feature I forgot to mention. With Sling Blue and Sling Orange combined with the Best of Spanish TV package (for a total of $45/month), you get all the FOX channels, all the NBC channels, all the ESPN channels as well as beIN SPORTS, beIN SPORTS Espanol and all of the Univision channels. Reply Jose January 8, 2017 You forget PS Vue is compatible with Chromecast and also you can use your PS Vue login with the native channel apps to watch other games. You can use login just like a cable login to access Fox Sports, NBC Live Extra and WatchESPN which solves your out of your home problem and for use in computers. I don’t think you did your research on this subject. Reply JeremyC July 18, 2016 As a former sling tv member that switched to ps vue, you hit it on the head with your response about the service. However the article was focused on soccer, but i agree that the info in the article was misleading because the PsVue Mid level package is much more valuable than the Sling tv’s patch work of packages, and is worth it. I can watch multiple espn streams on several tvs and phones, at the same time. Ive cut my cable bill by more than 80 dollars and get more. Reply Rye Brook July 17, 2016 Thanks so much for the review, good to see the pro’s and cons of each provider. I agree with Velija that competition is a good thing. I’m still over the moon that online only fans will be able to watch the premier league and other soccer/futbol using devices other than the bloated and expensive conventional TV packages with their lamentable customer service. For me the Sling pack is the only way to go because (1) I’ll be watching mostly on my MacBook Pro and (2) there’s times when I won’t be at my home ISP location. I’m really hoping that, for matches I can’t watch live, Sling will not reveal the outcome/score either by blatantly stating it on the launch page or giving obvious clues by having the link tab covered by a photo of the winning team wildly celebrating! Reply Christopher Harris July 17, 2016 Thanks for the kind words Rye. With so many streaming choices, the winner is we soccer fans who now have plenty of options to choose from. Reply Michael Hayes July 17, 2016 This Fall a new Real-time, interactive, live sports game app is launching. How it works is if you are watching a Premier League, or MLS, game, you open the app to that game and interact in real-time, by predicting and calling plays. The app will be a FREE download, and players can watch their favorite sports team, interactive by making predictions, and calling plays, and the player can earn rewards like hats and shirts, electronics like an iPad or TV, Vacations, Tickets to a Big Game, or even a car. Will change the way we play sports as fans. Launching in the Fall with live NFL Football and MLS Soccer then expand to Premier League, NBA Basketball, and other sports. Next year will be able to watch the British Open and predict shots, scores, and winners, in real-time. Reply Mike July 18, 2016 might as well have cable. My cable bill was $100, $50 internet & $50 tv (including a dvr). So whatever solution has to be not just $50 but well lower to make it worthwhile. I only want about 6 or 7 channels (NBC sports, NBC Sports extra channels, Fox Sports 1, ESPN, ESPN2, ESPN watch, Bien. So until there’s a solution that’s well cheaper than $50 bucks (i’m thinking $20-$30 at most) cable and a dvr is a better option. $45 bucks ain’t enough. I’d rather pay an extra $5, have a dvr, sleep in on weekends and watch games at reasonable hours. Use my dvr and see champions league games when i get home from work. Plus then i’d simply get an extra 100 channels i rarely watch anyways. Reply Steve N July 18, 2016 It should be mentioned that for all the channels that are mobile restricted so that you can’t access them outside the home — that’s not quite accurate. All the channels offer apps for iOS and Android, and you can log in to those channel apps using your Playstation Vue credentials. I use that all the time to access streaming content outside the home. When at home, I use the PS Vue app itself. Reply joe July 20, 2016 PlayStation Vue is hands down better. Reply joman July 21, 2016 without Question PlayStation Vue is the hands down winner, HD viewing of 75+ channels on the mid tier package, all my Philly Eagles , Flyers, Sixers, Phillies on Comcast channel DVR capability for up to 28 -days, plus they have added Roku Adroid Amazon Fire Tv& stick etc. the new Play station vue app just rolled out an updated firmware making the interface more user friendly. Sony has won this battle so far” Reply rev912 July 21, 2016 Question for Vue users, so I can log in and watch on my PS4 in the living room, Fire TV in bedroom, iPad whereever at home but I can’t login anywhere away from my home network like if I am in a hotel or visiting family? It’s tied to your home network or IP? Reply Kailong July 21, 2016 PlayStation Vue is clearly the better one, hands down….. If Sling really doesn’t sponsor this site, then here’s the key points missing out in this review: 1. Streaming quality: This is all we want. With Sling all I get is constant buffering, freezes and lags. What’s the point of lower price with lower quality? 3. IP/Mobile restriction: It is annoying but actually there is easy workaround. Use the Vue credentials on almost any TV everywhere apps and you are good to go. Mobile restriction is absolutely not a big issue here. I’m pretty sure that no one’s ever opened the horrendous Sling app during the Euro and Wimbledon season because of far superior quality on WatchESPN, which unfortunately is the only TV everywhere app supported. To Sling: if you don’t know how to do streaming, at least let others do the job for you. Reply Frill Artist August 13, 2016 Just change the name of the site to SlingSoccerTalk because we all know you’re shilling for them. You didn’t mention Vue’s DVR and CatchUp features. All you did was use every chance to bash and compare their service to Sling. You also lied. Vue has access to BEIN connect. Reply Christopher Harris August 13, 2016 Frill, PS Vue is one of our sponsors too. Regarding beIN SPORTS Connect, when I tested PS Vue this summer, I didn’t see Vue listed at https://beinsportsconnect.tv/index.html and I don’t think it worked when I tried to log in using Vue credentials. If it does work now, I stand corrected. Reply Monte Reed August 13, 2016 beIN Sports Connect is Included with Playstation VUE. Watching it right now on my phone Reply Ashot August 13, 2016 So what’s the best deal for watching Bein (connect), FS1 & FS2, NBCSN (live extra)? VUE Core $45? With Sling it can be cheaper but without Connects & Live extras…or Sling blue + FuboTV but still without Live Extra $35…still expensive for just watching football. Reply Thony August 28, 2016 Do I have access to BeinConnect with PS Vue Slim + Español Pack? I wonder because just includes Bein Sports in spanish, but I don´t see any mention of beinsports in english… I´m currently looking to change my Sling Orange+Spanish (25$/month) to either: – Sling Blue+Spanish (30$/month) which will include Bein Sports, NCBSN and Fox, but no access to online features of those channels.. – PS Vue Slim + Español (35$/month) which will include Bein Sports, NCBSN, Fox and ESPN. And it grants access to online features of those channels. The one I’m not sure is BeinConnected… and it matters a lot to me because I’m a die hard fan of Juventus (Serie A games are usually live in BeinSport (English))… so this matters a lot to me… I Think I´m going to be on the PS Vue side for this one Reply cmotomn September 23, 2016 Just verified that PlayStation Vue subscribers now have access to beIN Sports Connect! Reply FrillArtist February 1, 2017 PS Vue is now available on PC and Mac. The PS Vue interface on PS4 and PS3 is better than any Sling interface. Reply David February 1, 2017 The PS Vue is on Apple TV now as well. Reply Mike February 1, 2017 I’ve tried SlingTV, Fubo TV, PS Vue and Directv Now, all on Apple TV. PS Vue is the best choice in my opinion. With PS Vue Core package for $34.99, you get BeIn, Fox Sports, FS1, FS2, NBCSN, all ESPN channels, CNBC and USA Network (for when EPL games are broadcasted). Plus, you can use your PS Vue credentials to access the Fox Sports app which gives you Fox Soccer Plus games, all games on ESPN 3 and NBCSN. The DVR feature (keeps 10 or so episodes for daily shows, 28 episodes for weekly shows) and pause/rewind live TV is awesome. Sling TV has a problem with buffering/degradation, etc. El Classico match last Spring on Fubo TV was terrible. PS Vue is the way to go for number of sports/soccer channels at the best price. Reply VJ February 3, 2017 I have tried to activate Vue from outside of the US but can’t seem to do it without a US issued credit card. I do of course have VPN. Can anyone assist me? Reply SCH May 27, 2017 Is fox sports a necessary add on if my husband likes to watch all man city games, but also other soccer games? Reply Christopher Harris May 28, 2017 He’ll need FOX Sports in order to watch Manchester City games in the UEFA Champions League next season. Those games will be on either FS1 or FS2 (FOX Sports 1 or FOX Sports 2).

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Smartphones Comparison screenshots showing how much Apple Maps lags behind Google Maps A detailed comparison showing Google Maps' prowess over Apple Maps, has surfaced online in a recent blog post. Vinod Yalburgi   May 28, 2017 15:40 IST Apple Maps vs Google Maps: Which mapping service is better and why Apple Maps has long been playing catch-up with Google Maps as its mapping service has been lagging behind in coverage and other mapping information. The iPhone maker is reportedly making amends to keep up with the competition in recent times, but the latest comparison screenshots published on Justin's blog suggest otherwise. As seen in Justin's comparison review, there have been significant improvements made to Google Maps over the period of last one year as opposed to minor additions to Apple Maps. For instance, you can see the Patricia's Green Park in central San Francisco being compared side-by-side on both Apple and Google Maps. Check out a few of those interesting screenshots below: Comparison screenshot showing how much Apple Maps lags behind Google MapsJustinobierne Quite obviously, you will notice the amazing details like park paths and neighbouring landmarks clearly marked out on the Google Maps, but very sparse details on the Apple Maps. Furthermore, the report adds that the accuracy of information is dubious on Apple Maps, owing to the lack of details. Comparison screenshots showing how much Apple Maps lags behind Google MapsJustinobierne It seems certain business locations are being cycled (added or removed) on a monthly basis on the Apple Maps, while Google Maps will continue displaying all existing landmark locations for a given address without any limitations. The reason for the inflated number of changes being reported on Apple Maps has been attributed to its poor geocoder mechanism. Furthermore, the finer details on Google Maps are coupled with a polished and refined interface, making the points of interest more visible to the user. With the lack of refinements, Apple Maps continues to look outdated and not user-friendly like its Google counterpart.

In fact, the firm is now developing the said chip which has been named the Apple Neural Engine. Apple Neural Engine According to a Bloomberg report, the Apple Neural Engine would be used to "improve the way the company's devices handle tasks that would otherwise require human intelligence—such as facial recognition and speech recognition". This technology is expected to help solve the long-standing issue with battery drain and potentially make the overall smartphone experience better. There have been speculations the Cupertino firm has been testing out this innovation and is looking into releasing the next iPhone models later this year with this chip in tow. However, as common as Apple demeanor, the firm refused to confirm this information. AI developments While there have been no public announcements made by Apple, the missing pieces of the puzzle seem to orchestrate one by one. In the last few years, Apple CEO Tim Cook had mentioned how the company is setting aside a massive amount of time to study augmented reality and artificial intelligence and how to integrate them into their future hardware. In 2016, the firm began publishing its research on artificial intelligence. In January, it entered into the Partnership on AI, a research coalition of Silicon Valley firms whose primary goal is to observe the future of digital innovation and cybernetics. And just in February, it announced its plans to expand its Seattle headquarters wherein much of its AI and machine learning efforts take place. The AI market has grown so fast in the last few years. Pioneers taking the lead like Amazon and Google have stepped ahead of Apple with their Alexa and Assistant devices. Soon after, Apple would be able to pick up and move forward beyond Siri.

Now the electronics giant is bringing artificial intelligence to chips. Apple is working on a processor devoted specifically to AI-related tasks, according to a person familiar with the matter. The chip, known internally as the Apple Neural Engine, would improve the way the company’s devices handle tasks that would otherwise require human intelligence — such as facial recognition and speech recognition, said the person, who requested anonymity discussing a product that hasn’t been made public. Apple declined to comment. Engineers at Apple are racing to catch their peers at Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc. in the booming field of artificial intelligence. While Siri gave Apple an early advantage in voice-recognition, competitors have since been more aggressive in deploying AI across their product lines, including Amazon’s Echo and Google’s Home digital assistants. An AI-enabled processor would help Cupertino, California-based Apple integrate more advanced capabilities into devices, particularly cars that drive themselves and gadgets that run augmented reality, the technology that superimposes graphics and other information onto a person’s view of the world. “Two of the areas that Apple is betting its future on require AI,” said Gene Munster, former Apple analyst and co-founder of venture capital firm Loup Ventures. “At the core of augmented reality and self-driving cars is artificial intelligence.” Improved performance Apple devices currently handle complex artificial intelligence processes with two different chips: The main processor and the graphics chip. The new chip would let Apple offload those tasks onto a dedicated module designed specifically for demanding artificial intelligence processing, allowing Apple to improve battery performance. Should Apple bring the chip out of testing and development, it would follow other semiconductor makers that have already introduced dedicated AI chips. Qualcomm Inc.’s latest Snapdragon chip for smartphones has a module for handling artificial intelligence tasks, while Google announced its first chip, called the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), in 2016. That chip worked in Google’s data centres to power search results and image-recognition. At its I/O conference this year, Google announced a new version that will be available to clients of its cloud business. Nvidia Corp. also sells a similar chip to cloud customers. The Apple AI chip is designed to make significant improvements to Apple’s hardware over time, and the company plans to eventually integrate the chip into many of its devices, including the iPhone and iPad, according to the person with knowledge of the matter. Apple has tested prototypes of future iPhones with the chip, the person said, adding that it’s unclear if the component will be ready this year. Apple’s operating systems and software features would integrate with devices that include the chip. For example, Apple has considered offloading facial recognition in the photos application, some parts of speech recognition, and the iPhone’s predictive keyboard to the chip, the person said. Apple also plans to offer developer access to the chip so third-party apps can also offload artificial intelligence-related tasks, the person said. Developer conference Apple may choose to discuss some of its latest advancements in AI at its annual developer’s conference in June. At the same conference, Apple plans to introduce iOS 11, its new operating system for iPhones and iPads, with an updated user-interface, people with knowledge of the matter said last month. The company is also said to discuss updated laptops with faster chips from Intel Corp. An AI chip would join a growing list of processors that Apple has created in-house. The company began designing its own main processors for the iPhone and iPad in 2010 with the A4 chip. It has since released dedicated processors to power the Apple Watch, the motion sensors across its products, the wireless components inside of its AirPods, and the fingerprint scanner in the MacBook Pro. The company has also tested a chip to run the low-power mode on Mac laptops. In 2015, Bloomberg reported that Apple’s culture of secrecy stymied the iPhone maker’s ability to attract top AI research talent. Since then, Apple has acquired multiple companies with deep ties to artificial intelligence, has begun publishing papers related to AI research, has joined a key research group and has made hires from the field. In October 2016, Apple hired Russ Salakhutdinov from Carnegie Mellon University as its director of AI research. — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Lenovo’s struggling mobile business sets sight on high-end market Apple said to plan dedicated chip to power AI on devices Singapore’s road safety campaign takes a VR twist Upcoming video games: ‘Star Trek’ VR, ‘Tokyo 42,’ ‘Tekken 7,’ ‘Dirt 4,’ ‘Wipeout Collection’ Report: Facebook leaked documents show types of content it allows Report: Facebook leaked documents show types of content it allows You won’t believe how easy it is to fool Samsung Galaxy S8’s ‘eye security’ Samsung investigating Galaxy S8 ‘iris hack’ Samsung to reveal stretchable display North Korea-linked hackers ‘highly likely’ behind WannaCry, says Symantec Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: One Direction's Styles tops Billboard with solo album Reuters Video: Europe can no longer rely on allies, says Merkel Reuters Video: Dutchman Dumoulin wins Giro d'Italia Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Reuters Video: Thai man murders baby, commits suicide on Facebook Live Tilda Swinton unveils strange ‘Okja’ promo clip Related Articles Nokia, Apple bury hatchet in patent dispute Ready, Set, Go!

Bloomberg says the chip’s called the Apple Neural Engine internally, and could be used for “offloading facial recognition in the photos application, some parts of speech recognition, and the iPhone’s predictive keyboard to the chip.” By moving AI processing to a dedicated chip, battery life in devices could also see a boost since the main CPU and GPU wouldn’t be crunching as much data and gobbling as much power. The report says Apple plans to integrate the chip into its devices, but it’s unclear when that’ll happen, and if any iOS devices launching this year will have it. Apple’s work on an AI chip shouldn’t surprise anyone who’s paying attention to the competition. Virtually every tech company is working on improving AI processing on mobile devices. Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 835 chip, which is already in devices like the Samsung Galaxy S8, has a special module dedicated to processing AI tasks. Years ago, Apple started designing its own mobile processors to improve performance and reduce power consumption, and it’s really paid off. Despite having fewer cores, the iPhone 7 still crushes the Galaxy S8 when it comes to sheer performance. iPhones and iPads also come with an Apple-designed “M”-branded motion coprocessor to collect sensor data from the various included sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, compass, etc.). It’s this M chip that helps with tracking health and fitness data. Furthermore, in addition to the main Intel processors in the new MacBook Pros, there’s also a small Apple-made “T1” chip for powering the Touch Bar. Apple’s AirPods also have a custom W1 chip that helps with pairing them to iOS devices. Clearly, Apple loves making custom chips for things. We’re all for it, especially if that means longer battery life.

In the report, Dr. Christopher Thornberg — director of UCR’s Center for Economic Forecasting and Development — argued Husing’s “dismal outlook” does not stand up “under scrutiny.” Thornberg, who was paid $25,000 by the town, aligned with Assistant Town Manager Marc Puckett, who recently said water rates could be lowered by 15 percent if the town earned the right in court to buy Liberty for $100 million at an interest rate between 4 and 4.4 percent. Conversely, Husing’s report — funded by Liberty Utilities — concluded the average residential water bill in town would increase between $502 and $620 per year under town ownership. Husing previously called Puckett’s claim “heroic” given what he saw as a Federal Reserve (FED) “clearly on track to raise interest rates.” His analysis found that a $150 million revenue bond would likely come with interest between 5.25 and 7.25 percent, resulting in annual payments between $10 and $12.4 million, respectively. Thornberg disagreed with Husing’s notion that a $150 million bond would not cover the full cost of acquiring Liberty. Further, he viewed Puckett’s range of $80 to $100 million as “almost assuredly ... on the high side.” Citing a modest “pace of appreciation” in the value of Liberty’s system over the next two to three years, Thornberg pegged a potential sale price at roughly $75 million. “Dr. Husing’s dismal outlook for the town’s purchase plan ... is based on his assumption of (a) very high purchase price paradoxically along with considerably higher interest rates than current rates,” Thornberg wrote. “His justification for these higher numbers does not stand up under scrutiny.” Tony Penna — vice president of Liberty Apple Valley — defended Husing’s analysis, stating residents “can trust the carefully researched conclusions by the High Desert’s most respected economist.” “Repaying $150 million in bond debt plus interest will increase water bills by at least $500 annually,” Penna said. “There has never been an eminent domain takeover where promises of lower water bills came true.” In Felton, customers are paying “$500 every year to repay bond debt, plus water rates have increased by 67 percent,” according to Penna. Both reports focus on Measure F, which residents will vote on in a June 6 special election. A “yes” vote would allow the town to borrow up to $150 million to acquire Liberty’s system; a “no” would likely end the town’s takeover bid. “Dr. Husing’s analysis and recommendation that voters should reject Measure F is consistent with the findings of the Apple Valley Blue Ribbon Water Committee,” Penna said, “which concluded that the debt could exceed $200 million.” Thornberg argued that Husing’s $150 to $200 million sale-price range was supported by “an erroneous interpretation” of Algonquin Power & Utilities Corporation’s purchase of Apple Valley Ranchos and two other systems from the Carlyle Group in early 2016. “Total consideration received by Carlyle was for $327 million, but there was an assumption of $77 million in debt by the buyer,” Thornberg wrote. “This implies that the three utilities were purchased for a cash amount of $250 million ... Husing inexplicably adds the $77 million to the $327 million ... to arrive at a highly inflated cash purchase value of $404 million.” He also attacked Husing’s claim of interest rate hikes. “His implication is that an economy with low unemployment will have higher interest rates,” Thornberg wrote. “Unfortunately, this conclusion ... simply isn’t supported by the historic evidence.” The U.S. last reached full employment in 1988, 1998 and 2006, according to Thornberg. “These were periods of time, not unlike today, where unemployment hit bottom and then remained roughly steady until the next recession, in 1990, 2001 and 2008 respectively,” he wrote. “In all three full-employment periods, long term interest rates actually declined rather than (rose) sharply. Dr. Husing’s rationale for higher rates is simply incorrect.” Like Husing, Thornberg acknowledged the FED is “in the midst of steadily raising the Federal Funds rate,” but he argued “any scholar of interest rates understands that the pass-through to long term rates is small.” “In short, this fact also doesn’t support Dr. Husing’s aggressive predictions at all,” Thornberg writes. “It is worth noting that since he released his reports, long term interest rates have actually dipped.” Town officials sought the independent review in response to “outside criticism” like Husing’s, a statement shows. Town spokesperson Kathie Martin told the Daily Press that Thornberg’s report was paid for with approval of Town Manager Frank Robinson. “The town manager has authority to approve expenses up to ($50,000),” Martin said. Meanwhile, Robinson said he was “delighted” to see Puckett “vindicated” by Thornberg’s report. “Given the amount of criticism … against Marc Puckett and the rest of his team,” Robinson said, “I decided it was important to have an independent economist take a look at the numbers.” Read Thornberg’s full report here.

Jun Zhang, an analyst at Rosenblatt Securities, said in a note to investors that issues with the iPhone 8’s reported rear fingerprint sensor will delay the smartphone’s launch and that materials for its production won’t be available until the holiday 2017 quarter. As a result, Zhang said production orders for the new iPhone 8 will also be smaller than expected. As AppleInsider notes, Rosenblatt has also maintained an aggressively low target of $120 for Apple stock, despite its current price of around $150. Read: Alleged Images Of Apple Smartphone Show Touch ID On Back Of Device, Matte Black Model In the past, Zhang and Rosenblatt's predictions have sometimes been aggressive towards Apple. As AppleInsider pointed out, Zhang previously wrote in 2016 that if the Apple iPhone 7 didn’t have a significant panel upgrade, it would lack a driving feature for sales. The iPhone 7 would go on to fuel stronger year-over-year sales for Apple in the first quarter of 2017. While Apple has kept many details for the iPhone 8 under wraps, various leaks have provided a basic outline for the upcoming smartphone. Apple is expected to pair the iPhone 8 release with an iPhone 7s and 7s Plus refresh. The iPhone 8 is also expected to be a more boutique smartphone model with a possible price point of more than $1,000. The rear of the new iPhone is also expected to include a fingerprint sensor, similarly to the Samsung Galaxy S8 and Google Pixel. The rumored issues with the fingerprint sensor also come alongside similar product delay issues with the iPhone 8. Previously, it was rumored that Apple wanted to include Touch ID — where a user can validate their identity with a fingerprint — directly into the iPhone display. However, Apple reportedly ran into problems during the production process for the feature. At the time, Cowen and Company analyst Timothy Arcuri said Apple could potentially choose to either rely entirely on the front-facing camera with facial recognition for user validation. Apple could also move the Touch ID to the phone's backside or delay production on the phone, but still announce it alongside the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus. Read: Apple iPhone 8's High Price Will Not Dampen Sales, Survey Says For Apple, the company has ample reasons to ensure that the iPhone 8 hits the same heights of past iPhone releases. While the iPhone remains a driving factor in Apple’s current success, the smartphone field will see several high-profile releases this year like the LG G6 and has already seen similar flagship models like the Samsung Galaxy S8 and Google Pixel. Apple likely wants ensure that it gets the iPhone 8 launch right and maintains its current status as a market leader. Related Articles Siri To Get Galaxy S8's Bixby Vision Like Feature?

Over the course of a year, Google quietly turned its map inside-out – transforming it from a road map into a place map. A year ago, the roads were the most prominent part of the map – the thing you noticed first. Now, the places are. And: In our Comparison last year, we found that Apple generally showed a greater variety of places than Google: But look what happens when we resurvey Google a year later: It's quite a difference – and Google's mix is now much closer to Apple's. And: Speaking of Apple... while Google has been making all those changes, what has Apple been up to? After all, Apple announced an "all-new design" for Apple Maps just weeks before Google's Summer redesign. Let's take a look at how Apple looked a year ago, before it released its new design: And now let's see how it looks today: See the difference? I don't either. Last year, in addition to the major redesign, we also got Maps apps, so everything from ride-sharing to reservation making could live in and enhance maps. We also got steady progress for Apple Maps on the web. I expect we'll see some of the next-generation of Maps updates at WWDC 2017 but here's hoping Apple can shed its dependence on TomTom data, accelerate the updates, and start closing that gap. It's not about beating Google at maps either. It's about providing quality maps all Apple's own. Many people simply use whatever's built into the phone or tablet they buy, and for iPhone and iPad, that's Apple Maps. And they deserve as rapid and continuous improvements as possible. Apple's got a great geo team, we just need to see more from them in real time. Maps for iPhone and iPad What's new in the Maps app How to find locations and get directions with Maps How to share location and directions with Maps How to delete your search history and prior destinations in Maps How to use Siri with Maps How to enable and use Maps extensions Best Maps app extensions How to change settings for Maps How to report a problem in Maps How to use Maps with CarPlay Reader comments Apple Maps vs. Google Maps: A year in analysis 23 Comments View All Comments Log In to Comment Register Sort by Date Sort by Rating wesee The week that Apple Maps first came out, I got a wedding invitation that stated, "Don't use Google Maps, because it's wrong." I knew where the church was, and sure enough Google was wrong. I tried it in Apple Maps, and it was perfect. Since then I have used Apple Maps only, and have yet to be let down. I travel all over Southern Ontario, and into the US at times. I know people find spots that are wrong, but that can be said for Google too. I'll happily stick with Apple Maps. 0 1 day ago Reply Rene Ritchie No maps really work for me. Google stopped announcing exit numbers for a while, which meant I couldn't use them on the local highways. Just last week I asked both Google and Apple Maps to take me to a local town hall. Apple showed me the wrong town, Google wanted me to go to the U.S. The floods ended here almost two weeks ago and Google still wants to redirect me around them, but wants to take me through roads blocked by construction for almost a month. I get that mapping is hard and up-to-the-minute mapping almost impossible, so generally I try to just get general ideas and not worry the details much. 0 1 day ago Reply Steve Adams The opposite for us when apple started with maps. We went to a hockey tourney with my son, his iPhone shoed the stadium on the opposite side of town and my nokia brought us right to the correct door. 0 10 hours ago Reply wvayens I really prefer the look of Apple maps. I use maps more to tell me how to get someplace rather than finding places. And I find the "look" when I'm navigating to be much cleaner and easier to read. 0 1 day ago Reply masaoota I'm totally the opposite - I find Google Maps visually a lot easier to view and follow. This is particularly so in London where they have clear classic icons on the map for underground stations and train stations which are often the main landmarks I navigate by. The Apple Maps representation of these is really poor. 0 1 day ago Reply PoisonMaps I think this is an example of why Google Maps is so much better than Apple Maps for countries outside North America. Apple Maps is very much based on roads, which is probably fine in the U.S, where most people drive everywhere, but doesn’t work elsewhere. As you say, in London people’s knowledge of the layout of the city is generally garnered from the tube map (an iconic design that I am unhealthily fond of), and so Google make sure that the stations are prominent. I don’t know for sure, but Apple don’t seem to have the same global knowledge. They have some great transit functionality, with fantastic levels of detail, but the London tube stations are barely shown on the main map unless you specifically select the Transit option. I assume that Apple Maps are coded by guys in Cupertino so this probably seems a reasonable assumption. However I guess that Google have people in each country giving feedback about what locals expect to be on a map, and that makes their maps so much better to use. Apple really need to up their game with maps, especially outside the US. I am sure that they are great for driving, but what about when walking? Especially when in the countryside, which is where Apple Maps is frankly awful. This was understandable when they first started, but is pretty pathetic 5 years later. Why do they show so few (if any) paths? Surely people in the US like to hike as well? Hopefully Apple will up their game in Maps at WWDC. They have made all sorts of amazing peripheral improvements (3D flyovers, transit, reservations etc) but the basic maps are not much better than they were 5 years ago (at least here in the UK). They still prioritise driving and ignore walking, which is pretty poor for a general purpose app. 0 1 day ago Reply indoctrahol I'll give Apple Maps another go around. The issue I have with it when using just for a little bit was there is a bit too much movement when navigating. It becomes a bit hard to reorientate your sense of direction when this happens too much. Maybe I'm just getting old. 0 1 day ago Reply Vox My only problem with Apple Maps is that it's the only option when it comes to Car Play...can't open Waze or Google Maps in the place I need them most...my car. Usually Apple Maps works well here in Monterrey (Mexico), but when it doesn't, I've got to pull out my phone holder and stick it to the window to be able to use Waze (which is usually the best of the 3 for me here). 0 1 day ago Reply Thoughter Rene, by focusing just on the look of Apple Maps, you are leaving out the huge improvements that Apple continues to roll out. For example, it's just in the past year AM has implemented the hugely beneficial "alternate routes" pop up when accidents occur. Apple Transit is also superior to GM Transit, not in number of regions yet, but in accuracy and user features. (Apple could have turned on every region at once, as Google did, if they simply were satisfied with stock data, but Google was criticized for accuracy, etc., and Apple wanted a very different user experience. Also, it would be good for you with your contacts to do an article on what is around the corner with Apple anticipated to compete its base map this year or early 2018. This will lead to some fantastic developments, such as Sky to ground zoom, again far superior than the GM Streetview which is very dated and clunky to use. 0 1 day ago Reply Thoughter Rene, also it would be great in an article to let folks know how huge mapping is in Apple's future. With the debacle of a roll out, Apple has intentionally been low key in building base map and adding features, but they are adding thousands of employees to mapping, e.g., new center in India, and mapping is integral to the future Apple ecosystem, something most don't realize. 0 1 day ago Reply SkydiverTilt Two YEARS after moving into my house I still have to tell people not to use Apple Maps. It's just awful. Apple reallly needs to allow Google maps integration into the iOS for one click directions. Apple maps isn't even close (and I'm an Apple fan boy), not by **** far. Stays deleted (thank you Apple for at least allowing it to be deleted so as not to accidentally click a link and open up that garbage of an app) 0 1 day ago Reply DannyJJK If you've read the previous comments on here, Apple Maps is certainly not garbage. Yes it's probably inaccurate in your area, but just because it's bad in one area doesn't mean it's bad all round. Google Maps is very inaccurate for me around where I live, by your logic that means Google Maps is just as garbage as well 0 15 hours ago Reply stratmansd Google Maps is really better when it comes to overall reference and map information. But when it comes to driving directions, I find Apple Maps and Google Maps are mostly the same. Google maps is good at giving you lane instructions which Apple Maps doesn't do. However, I've had Google either stop giving directions or begin giving me directions in an opposite direction. I haven't had these problems with Apple Maps. Apple Maps is usually reliable when I'm driving and using Car Play. 0 1 day ago Reply AdamHunterATC I am, for the most part, content with Apple Maps. Give me lane guidance and multi-destination routing, and it'll be perfect for me. 0 1 day ago Reply n8ter#AC Most people I know use Google Maps. I haven't driven in like... Years, Lol. So, naturally I only use Maps when told to. In that case, I just use whatever device I have. If I have my Windows Tablet, I will just use that cause it has GPS and Offline Maps. If I'm on my Kindle I'll check on that if I'm tethered. If i'm on my Phone, I will check Apple Maps, cause I don't install redundant apps on my phone (like Google Maps). I've yet to have any of those take me to the wrong place, so I pretty much don't care about these details anymore... 0 21 hours ago Reply iDonev Over where I live (Bulgaria) Apple Maps has much more serious problems than your usual "oh, there aren't enough businesses and places of interest" or the "road is closed due to construction work and it's not reflected on the map". The biggest issue Apple Maps has for me is the omission of small roads and pedestrian walkways. As such Apple Maps cannot even give me the fastest route to my location. Google Maps, on the other hand, is much more comprehensive. That said, I still prefer Apple Maps, I just need to duplicate my route search in Google Maps to make sure that I am going where I need to go and that I will get there as quickly as possible. 0 20 hours ago Reply Ttrq2001 For a very nice job with the same topic, head over here and check out what this other author has to say! Enjoy. https://www.justinobeirne.com/a-year-of-google-maps-and-apple-maps 0 11 hours ago Reply PoisonMaps That's the article that Rene is talking about. 0 11 hours ago Reply Ttrq2001 Ah got it. That article is really good! Thx PM! 0 11 hours ago Reply PoisonMaps No worries. It is a great article that gives a good insight into the difficulty of creating maps that are used for all sorts of purposes. I think they should give the user more control over what they want to see on the map. Both apps have “transport” modes, and Google have “cycling”, but why not have options for hiking, shopping, tourism, emergencies etc? Although then no-one would buy my app! 0 11 hours ago Reply Derrick4Real yes a very good article. And if it's relying on Tom Tom information it explains why for more than a year my like 30 requests for a correction of a business and address went unfixed. They probably could not fix it because it was someone else's information, which i always suspected. That said they did offer a place to offer corrections. So i figured they had some input. 0 2 min ago Reply Steve Adams Oh, for driving, at least, download HERE maps. It's the BEST mapping / navigation for driving . 0 10 hours ago Reply Derrick4Real My experience is very much the opposite. Google has always and still does have far more detail, businesses in my area, LA. The addresses and business names are more accurate too. I even told apple several times about errors that didn't get fixed until just last year. Google street view is the killer feature though and i haven't seen an apple offering that compares to that. I do wish google had a feature where i could just have it in 3d driving mode w/o navigating somewhere. And also even when you're driving or navigating it doesn't always show the map in the direction your moving which is annoying. Google also has maps inside many stores here which was actually quite useful as when i was looking for a used record store i peered inside and it was pretty easy to determine that it wasn't a traditional record store but was more of a joint selling overpriced brand new albums you could get at Urban Outfitters and incense. Apple is ok. i use it sometimes. But it really annoyed me when i used it to drive to "Walmart" only to find out it was really a "Sam's Club", a business owned by Walmart but clearly messed up on Apple's maps. Somehow I'm guessing they got the information messed up. Unfortunately the nearest Walmart was like a 25 minute drive away. And i hate Walmart. I didn't want to have to go in the first place. Interestingly, i noticed Yelp had the exact same error along with several other errors Apple's maps had. I theorized that wherever they got their data from it was the same place. 0 29 min ago Reply Menu Log in or Sign up Search Apple Apps & Games Accessories & Toys Photo & Video Health & Fitness Movies & Music Transport Security Rumors Analysis How To The Best Reviews Deals Newsletter Forums Podcasts Android Central WindowsCentral iMore CrackBerry Connectedly TeslaCentral VRHeads MrMobile Modern Dad About Contact Us Jobs Privacy & Terms Mobile Nations 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2017 Mobile Nations Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Careers: Writer | Dev Licensing External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner

Prices start around $30 for the 38mm and 42mm, so why not grab one for you and one for a friend? See at Amazon Kades stainless steel link bracelet Let's say you've been frustrated by watch bands that are far too big on your wrist for far too long, and you're convinced that the link bracelet look just won't work for you. This bracelet from Kades is out to prove you wrong, friend. You'll be able to remove up to 10 links, even from the 38mm version, so the link look can be yours, all yours! All four color variations have beautiful brushed metal surfaces that look absolutely unique and authentic. Guess who didn't pay hundreds of dollars? You, because Kades sells these beauties for about $29 to $31. For that price, you can get a band in each of the four colors for either your 38mm or 42mm watch and still not come close to Apple's original price. See at Amazon Happy Cell link bracelet band The link bracelet from Happy Cell is only available for the 42mm Apple Watch. For all you watch wearers out there who are looking to stay truer to the exclusive color options from Apple, this is the band you've been looking for. There are three color variations available and they all look sharp. The butterfly clasp locks securely in place, and it's easy to remove multiple links if you find the standard bands just a little loose on your wrist. You'll pay a little more for this band than some of the other alternatives, anywhere from $50 to $90, but that's still a drop in the bucket when you aren't quite ready to buy the real thing. See at Amazon OULUOQI butterfly stainless steel bracelet A warranty can be comforting when you're buying an alternative brand for your Apple Watch, and that's the first way OULUOQI delivers with their band. Their 18 month manufacturer's warranty means that you can get a replacement band if something happens to you gorgeous new band, but it's a comfort you're not likely to need. The well-reviewed band is a favorite for a reason. As alternative brand bands go, OULUOQI is on the more expensive end, with both the 38mm and 42mm watch bands costing about $90. A feature we love about the brand is how some links are removable with a simple release button, so you don't have to fuss with any tiny tools to shrink the band size. Combine that convenience with the spot-on match of Apple's silver and space black colors and you've got a winning watch band! See at Amazon Pomarks Apple Watch Band Wrist Strap Link Bracelet If you're looking for a near-identical dupe to the Apple Watch link band, then we recommend taking a peek at the Apple Watch Band Wrist Strap Link Bracelet from Pomarks.

When he's not bothering his chihuahuas, Mikah spends entirely too much time and money on HomeKit products. You can follow him on Twitter at @mikahsargent if you're so inclined. Want to start using Apple's HomeKit home automation for iPhone and iPad? Here's everything you need to know! Just getting started with HomeKit or recently purchased your first HomeKit-enabled accessory? Awesome! You've just bought into one of the most secure, most easy-to-use connected home platforms — especially if you're using an iOS device like an iPhone or iPad. Now, while Apple's take on the connected home is designed to be simple and secure, it can still be a little daunting. That's why we've put together this guide: to give you all the information you'll need (and then some!) to set up and use HomeKit-enabled accessories and apps. Don't worry, you'll be controlling your home with Siri and the iOS Home app in no time! How HomeKit works What the heck is HomeKit and how does it work? Fair question. When you buy a connected home accessory that works with Apple HomeKit, you're buying a product that's been tested by Apple for both security and functionality. HomeKit is a framework that connects your home automation products and lets you control them with your voice, via Siri, and your taps, via the Home app for iOS. Here's an example: Say you buy Elgato's Eve Room, a HomeKit-enabled product that monitors a room's air quality, temperature, and humidity. After you perform an initial setup process, Apple's HomeKit framework securely connects the accessory to your iOS devices and lets you access its sensors (air quality, temperature, and humidity) in HomeKit-enabled apps and via Siri. You can learn more about how HomeKit operates here: The science behind HomeKit HomeKit FAQ: Everything you need to know Should you use HomeKit? HomeKit has improved quite a bit since its introduction in 2014; at this point I can absolutely recommend going all-in on a HomeKit-enabled home. Serenity Caldwell's original thoughts on HomeKit After four months with HomeKit, I can say that while I love it, it's definitely not perfect: HomeKit accessories only just started arriving in 2015, and the framework is just two years old. As such, there are still plenty of bugs to be fixed and kinks to work out in the system. Siri doesn't always work; Bluetooth-based accessories can't update without a device nearby to check their status; and Wi-Fi based accessories all require different bridges—which leads to a lot of bridges in your network room. Would I use HomeKit to run my door locks? Not yet—it's still a little too finicky for my taste. But for lights, plugs, and thermostats, the service is great. When HomeKit does work, it's downright magical, and when it doesn't, well... the accessories I mentioned above also all have manual control options. So it doesn't outright break anything; you just go back to living in the status quo switch world of before. Four months in, I have around 85 percent reliability with my HomeKit devices, and I'm only seeing Siri's response rate and connectivity increase as time goes on. Is HomeKit worth it if you're willing to suffer the occasional early adopter bug? Absolutely. Considering that you can pick up a HomeKit-enabled plug for just $30 to start your collection, there's no huge monetary buy-in; Apple's emphasis on the security aspect also elevates the home automation service above fellow competitors like Wink and WeMo. And recent support from longtime home automation players like Philips Hue makes it even easier to drop some cash to play in the HomeKit ecosystem. Ultimately, it'll still be a few years before I think we'll see HomeKit really grab mass attention, but it's a ripe playground for early adoption and experimentation. Scenes let you set up complex actions, triggerable by a phrase to Siri; Triggers offer even more control, letting you set up action- and time-based events so that you have to do as little fiddling with switches and Siri as possible. For me, HomeKit is a blast—even with the occasional bug or two—and I can't wait to see where it's going in the future.

Do you have any 'scenes' set up that have both philips hue lights and lutron switches involved? I have the philips lights and i want to add a string of christmas lights with the lutron plug-in dimmer. If i say "hey siri, set the movie scene" will she change the hue lights and the lutron? Is this something you have tried? I've been reading your posts and it sort of seems like it will work. but i'm a little skeptical yet. Thanks for your help! 0 1 year ago Reply SteveW25561 I can't find the answer to these issues I have with HomeKit: 1. Is there an away mode/scene to simulate someone in the house? I can't find any randomization feature, and Google searches about "HomeKit" and "away" yield results talking about the Apple TV or iPad allowing out-of-home access to HomeKit. 2. How well can Bluetooth low-energy HomeKit devices (as opposed to WiFi connected HomeKit devices) connect and work, especially if you have many that are more than 100 feet away or separated by walls? I see this as a major issue if you want to deploy HomeKit devices more than a small radius away from your Apple TV. 0 6 months ago Reply Menu Log in or Sign up Search Apple Apps & Games Accessories & Toys Photo & Video Health & Fitness Movies & Music Transport Security Rumors Analysis How To The Best Reviews Deals Newsletter Forums Podcasts Android Central WindowsCentral iMore CrackBerry Connectedly TeslaCentral VRHeads MrMobile Modern Dad About Contact Us Jobs Privacy & Terms Mobile Nations 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2017 Mobile Nations Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Careers: Writer | Dev Licensing External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner

Speed up app installs and iCloud access on your Apple devices! By Anthony Casella Saturday, May 27, 2017 at 3:00 pm EDT 1 Comment How can I more quickly install apps, get iCloud data, and update all of my Apple devices? Do you have a lot of Apple hardware to maintain? Perhaps you are a small office that manages numerous similar Apple devices? You can speed up the updating of your Macs, the downloading of your apps, and access to your iCloud data while at the same time reducing your internet bandwidth usage by installing the macOS Server Caching Service! What does the Caching service do? In my household, we have (in their various forms): 4 iPads, 4 iPhones, 3 AppleTVs, 3 MacBook Pros, 2 MacBook Airs, 1 MacBook, and 1 iMac. That's a lot of downloading to do for iCloud synchronization and system updates across all of those devices. You may have a metered internet package or you might need to make certain your Apple-related downloads don't use up all of the bandwidth. The Caching service helps by keeping a local network copy of app downloads, system updates, iCloud data, iBooks purchases and the like. Once one iPhone downloads a newly purchased app or goes on to synchronize documents in iCloud, the caching service will automatically save a copy of the file on its hard drive and the rest of your devices can look to the local macOS Server running the caching service to download it rather than downloading it from the internet. This speeds up installation and synchronization on all subsequent devices by many times! Install macOS Server on one of your Macs If you haven't already done so, you'll need to install macOS Server on one of your network Macs. You can follow our detailed guide if you need a little more help, but here is the express version. Launch the App Store application. Search for macOS Server in the search bar at the top right of the app. Click Buy next to macOS Server or if already purchased, you'll be notified that you can download it for free. Click Install. Agree to the User Agreement. How to set up the caching service Launch the Server App Select Caching under the Services listing. Optionally select Edit Permissions to determine which devices on which networks are allowed to connect to your macOS Server. Optionally select Edit Peering Permissions to select from what networks other Caching servers can be used to share data. Leave Cache personal iCloud data enabled to allow for caching of iCloud data to quickly synchronize all of your iCloud-connected devices. Click Change Location if you have a secondary storage device connected to your macOS Server to change the cache location. Click and drag the Slider or type in the Cache Size to set how much of your storage device you want to use for the caching service. Click the OFF/ON button to start the service. Restart all of your Apple devices so that they can detect the caching service running on your network. With that, your devices will automagically start using and storing data and files on your caching server. You can see what type of file and how much space is being used for each type of data populating your server. If ever you need to reset the data in the cache, you need to simply click on Reset on the caching service administration page. Any comments or questions? This is by far one of the most useful and simplest services to set up on your Apple-centric network. It's also one of the most impactful since the bandwidth and time saved can be dramatic across all of your hardware. If you have any questions or comments, leave it below! Reader comments Speed up app installs and iCloud access on your Apple devices! 1 Comment View All Comments Log In to Comment Register Sort by Date Sort by Rating darbmore When does the caching need to be reset? My Server says that the cache is full. Would be convenient if the Server removes old cache dynamically similar to how iOS works with photos and music. 0 1 day ago Reply Menu Log in or Sign up Search Apple Apps & Games Accessories & Toys Photo & Video Health & Fitness Movies & Music Transport Security Rumors Analysis How To The Best Reviews Deals Newsletter Forums Podcasts Android Central WindowsCentral iMore CrackBerry Connectedly TeslaCentral VRHeads MrMobile Modern Dad About Contact Us Jobs Privacy & Terms Mobile Nations 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2017 Mobile Nations Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Careers: Writer | Dev Licensing External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner

Tony Bramwell's stories from inside the inner circle of the band who were the biggest in the world in their heyday will recall the days when they toured Devon and played to hysterical fans in cinemas and dance halls. Music and film producer Tony Bramwell grew up in Liverpool with Beatles George, Paul, and John. His life became intertwined with the legendary band, first working for Brian Epstein at N.E.M.S. and then for The Beatles at Apple, heading Apple Films, then later as the CEO of Apple Records. Tony is pictured (far right) at a function at the Post Office Tower in London with Paul McCartney (second from left) He tells his vivid stories of the Beatles' lives on and off stage in his acclaimed book Magical Mystery Tours - My Life With The Beatles. After the band split, he became the United Kingdom's first independent record promoter, representing artists including Bruce Springsteen. He co-ordinated and promoted music for films including Harry Saltzmann's James Bond features, which included Paul McCartney's Live and Let Die. Other films included Chariots of Fire, Dirty Dancing, and Ghost. Tony will be talking about his life in film and music, including producing music videos for The Beatles, Roxy Music, The Cure and discovering the talent of Eva Cassidy. He will be at the English Riviera Film Festival on June 17 at the English Riviera Centre in Torquay.

The audience at the venue, which sat roughly where Waterstones is now on Exeter High Street, heard performances of All My Loving, From Me to You, Twist and Shout, She Loves You and I Saw Her Standing There. The show featured the Fab Four topping a line up that included the Brook Brothers, The Kestrels and Peter Jay & The Jaywalkers. In all, the Beatles played six gigs in Devon.

(Image Reuters) Apple opened its first Southeast Asia store in Singapore today, drawing hundreds of excited fans to the swanky two-storey site in the city’s upmarket shopping district. Located on the affluent Orchard Road, the new shop –easily distinguished by its iconic glass facade — is expected to be one of the most popular Apple stores in the world according to the US tech giant. Merchandise such as the iPhone and MacBook were strategically placed on display across the spacious first floor, while the upper level acted as a classroom for customers to participate in hands-on sessions. Hundreds of shoppers camped out in anticipation of the launch, while more than a thousand thronged the store soon after the doors opened, an AFP reporter observed. First in the queue was Xiang Jiaxin, a twenty-five-year-old Chinese national working in Macau who had queued for more than 12 hours overnight and planned a holiday to Singapore specially to coincide with the opening. “I am very happy and excited to be part of this. I have participated in the official store openings in Macau, Guangzhou and Nanjing,” he told AFP.

Located on the affluent Orchard Road, the new shop — easily distinguished by its iconic glass facade — is expected to be one of the most popular Apple stores in the world according to the US tech giant. Merchandise such as the iPhone and MacBook were strategically placed on display across the spacious first floor, while the upper level acted as a classroom for customers to participate in hands-on sessions. Hundreds of shoppers camped out in anticipation of the launch, while more than a thousand thronged the store soon after the doors opened, a reporter observed. First in the queue was Xiang Jiaxin, a twenty-five-year-old Chinese national working in Macau who had queued for more than 12 hours overnight and planned a holiday to Singapore specially to coincide with the opening. “I am very happy and excited to be part of this. I have participated in the official store openings in Macau, Guangzhou and Nanjing,” he said. Apple, which has a staggering $256.8 billion cash stockpile, celebrated its 40th anniversary last year.

BY MTHANDAZO NYONI Walter Chidhakwa The government has, through Apple Bridge Investment – a special purpose vehicle established to facilitate chrome ore exports – set prices at which it buys the mineral from local producers. Locally, chrome prices vary from $40 to $80 per tonne for lumpy chrome, depending on the grade, while chrome concentrates attract $84 a tonne. On the export market, Zimbabwe’s chrome attracts between $80 and $100 per tonne for concentrates. According to a position paper prepared by the Confederation of Zimbabwe Small Scale Chrome Miners (CZSSCM) member, Lindiwe Mpofu, the pricing structure should be aligned with global chrome ore market prices. “The pricing structure is harmful and halting export sales. We are requesting under the mandate that CZSSCM has to harmonise with MMCZ/Apple Bridge that an immediate review be conducted and moving forward, the uniform price must be aligned with global chrome ore market prices,” reads part of the paper. The paper indicates that over the past year and a half, the MMCZ/Apple Bridge arrangement has deterred international buyers due to the pricing being largely out of sync with the market. “Evidence is shown by the shockingly low number of export buyers in Zimbabwe. “This has ultimately led to the under capitalisation of small-scale miners as we are unable to execute consistent sales as the market avoids doing business in Zimbabwe due to extremely high pricing,” it reads in part. “A clear example is the current situation where global chrome prices have greatly fallen since December 2016. Despite the price drop, MMCZ/Apple Bridge continues to hold a uniform price that is far higher than the market price. “Currently, MMCZ has decided to hold prices at levels that far exceed the market prices. This has caused a halt to international trade with Zimbabwe”. For example, Mpofu said 44% chrome was priced at $175 per tonne at the mine while current trade prices of the same grade delivered to China averaged $200 per tonne. This means that a buyer is expected to deliver the chrome to a smelter in China for $25 per tonne. “The expectation by MMCZ/Apple Bridge is that all costs, including margin, are to be placed in the $25 dollar allowance,” she said. “This is not possible. $25 cannot even cover the cost of transport out of Zimbabwe, which averages $60 to $70 per tonne. “One of the causes of the high prices by MMCZ/Apple Bridge is that they have relied on chrome trading spot prices as a guide for Zimbabwe chrome prices.” Mpofu said the spot prices used related to chrome being delivered to China CIF with all costs including distributor margins required to get the chrome to the Chinese port. Mpofu said MMCZ/Apple Bridge pricing does not take into consideration the distribution costs, including margins required to deliver the chrome to Chinese ports. “Based on this pricing structure, it appears that there is an expectation by MMCZ/Apple Bridge to have only end users such as international smelters and manufacturers buy directly from Zimbabwe as they have excluded the distributor’s costs [buying houses and traders] from their price planning,” she said. The chrome client base is buying houses and minerals traders. End users such as smelters and manufacturers buy from buying houses and traders because they are the ones equipped to manage supply, reserves and quality, she said. “The market relies on traders and buying houses to efficiently distribute the supply of chrome globally. “Pricing chrome as though these important distributors of chrome do not exist has halted chrome sales in Zimbabwe. The pricing structure currently does not take into consideration the buyer’s costs or the types of buyers in the global marketplace,” Mpofu wrote. To further stress the importance of buying houses and traders, she said these distributors typically buy from multiple sources ensuring supplies in excess of the 100 000 tonne range. “These are the quantities necessary to ensure international smelters do not shut down and that there is no interruption in the supply of chrome during the manufacturing processes,” she added. “Pricing as though MMCZ/Apple Bridge expects a manufacturer to buy directly from MMCZ/Apple Bridge is not an accurate expectation. Only a distributor can manage the quantities manufacturers and smelters require at the time they require it.” Mpofu said when approached by members of CZSSCM to notify them of the pricing issue, MMCZ/Apple Bridge said they should wait the market out and not to make further pricing corrections. “This means that they are willing to halt chrome sales in Zimbabwe. In other words, they would rather earn zero tax revenue for Zimbabwe and zero sales for the small-scale miner for the next six months to a year, while hoping the prices will rise to 2016 December prices caused by chrome inventory shortages,” she said. “Halting trade by refusing to acknowledge market forces has affected the Zimbabwean small-scale miner,” she said. However, MMCZ deputy manager marketing, Masimba Chandavengerwa said they were not chasing away buyers but the challenge was the volatility of chrome ore prices. “The prices have been falling due to low uptake of chrome in China. It’s not that customers have run away and we are not chasing them away,” Chandavengerwa said, adding that even after they had told customers that they would quote prices on spot basis, they did not take a position. Chandavengerwa said prices have fallen from $160 to between $80 and $100 “and even with those prices, no customer is prepared to take a position”. “We are trying to push but customers are not there. If there is a producer who has got a customer, let him/her come forward with it and we finalise. We are there as their ambassadors. The problem is that we have middlemen who don’t care about production costs and therefore, these are the same people who are making a lot of noise,” he said. Chandavengerwa said for chrome to reach its final export destination, it takes longer and as such, due to volatility of its prices, buyers were afraid to make losses. As a solution, chrome miners recommended that MMCZ and Apple Bridge acknowledge the change in market direction and align prices to the market. During this period, the trade prices delivered to China average $225, therefore, ex-mine prices should be calculated within the range of $65-$85 for market buyers to cover the distribution and margin costs in this downward market and as prices improve, we will revert upward on price along with the market, she said. This action will serve to attract the 300-400 buyers required to re-establish the Zimbabwe chrome market. “To mitigate the current situation, we request that immediate action be taken to save our sector in the current downturn. An emergency meeting must be called to rectify the current pricing structure,” she said. “Buyers and investors are pulling out with immediate effect due to the fact that our pricing excludes the cost of distributing and moving the chrome to the final destination”. She said miners require daily gazetted pricing for chrome products aligned with the world market pricing as this was the standard practice for globally traded commodities. Mpofu said publicly published prices would also enable miners to plan their business according to the market price available. Miners minister Walter Chidakwa recently told the Chamber of Mines annual general meeting and conference that Zimbabwe will rake in $3 billion in minerals exports this year mainly due to the rebound in chrome prices on the international market. Zimbabwe and South Africa hold 70% of the world’s chrome reserves. Subscribe Subscribe to our e-mail newsletter to receive updates.

By: Tech Desk | New Delhi | Updated: May 28, 2017 6:37 pm Artificial intelligence and machine learning are increasing becoming important, with players like Google, Amazon and Microsoft pumping millions of dollars. Apple might be developing a new custom chipset for artificial intelligence (AI) processing, reports Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. The chipset, internally known as Apple Neural Engine, will be used to handle AI-related tasks like speech and facial recognition. The chipset could be incorporated into Apple’s upcoming devices such as iPhone and iPad. Gurman writes Apple’s current devices are equipped to handle artifical intelligence processes with two different chipset: the main processor or microprocessor, and the graphics chipset, or “GPU”. The custom chipset would allow Apple to offload some processing done by the main chipset and by the GPU, allowing the company to improve battery performance on its devices. The report goes on to say that Apple plans to integrate the chip into other devices, and has even tested prototypes of iPhones with the built-in chip. That said, it makes sense for Apple as its competitors in the tech industry are increasing betting on artificial intelligence (AI) for future growth. Google, for instance, has developed its own chipset for machine learning, called “TPUs”, the second-generation version of which was announced at this year’s I/O. Similarly, Qualcomm’s latest flagship processor, Snapdragon 835, has a dedicated module for an artificial intelligence (AI). According to Apple analyst Gene Munster,”Two of the areas that Apple is betting its future on require AI. At the core of augmented reality and self-driving cars is artificial intelligence.” Over the past few years, Apple has acquired a number of companies having expertise in artificial intelligence and machine learning. In 2016, Apple hired Russ Salakhutdinov from Carnegie Mellon University as its director of AI research. Most recently, Apple released its first AI research paper, which focused on machine vision technologies. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are increasing becoming important, with players like Google, Amazon and Microsoft pumping millions of dollars. It is possible that Apple could share more information about the chipset at WWDC , the annual developer conference to take place June5-9 in San Jose, California. Apple will unveil iOS 11, the latest mobile operating system, along with a new version of macOS, its computer operating system For all the latest Tech News, download Indian Express App now © IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd Tags: Apple No Comments.

And it made me wonder what else would change, if we kept watching. Would Google keep adding detail? And would Apple, like Google, also start making changes? So I wrote a script that takes monthly screenshots of Google and Apple Maps.1 And thirteen months later, we now have a year’s worth of images. The screenshot comparisons in his post perfectly demonstrate Google's iteration and Apple's relative stagnation. Speaking from personal experience, Google Maps has considerably improved in my area in the past year, while Apple Maps has remained essentially the same. Which isn't to say that Apple Maps is bad – Google simply has an edge over local business information and they're evolving at a faster pace than Apple. To me, Apple Maps looks and feels nicer; Google Maps seems smarter and it has modern features I'd like Apple to add. I wonder what Apple has in store for WWDC and if they should consider separating Maps from their monolithic software release cycle in the summer. (See also: O'Beirne in May and June 2016.)

Hundreds of people waited outside Apple's first store in Southeast Asia in Singapore.  Apple opened its first Southeast Asia store in Singapore yesterday, drawing hundreds of excited fans to the swanky two-storey site in the city’s upmarket shopping district. Located on the affluent Orchard Road, the new shop—easily distinguished by its iconic glass facade—is expected to be one of the most popular Apple stores in the world according to the US tech giant. Merchandise such as the iPhone and MacBook were strategically placed on display across the spacious first floor, while the upper level acted as a classroom for customers to participate in hands-on sessions. Hundreds of shoppers camped out in anticipation of the launch, while more than a thousand thronged the store soon after the doors opened, an AFP reporter observed. First in the queue was Xiang Jiaxin, a twenty-five-year-old Chinese national working in Macau who had queued for more than 12 hours overnight and planned a holiday to Singapore specially to coincide with the opening. “I am very happy and excited to be part of this.

Is AI on iPhones Apple’s Next Big Goal? Is AI on iPhones Apple’s Next Big Goal? Featured NEWS Technology SHARE Christy Gren , May 27, 2017 / 199 0 Apple always thrives to achieve something new with its iPhones during every new release. From excellent quality cameras, to wireless earplugs, Apple Inc. has experimented with everything. So, what now? Well, the latest boiling topics in the Silicon Valley are certainly autonomous vehicles, Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Being the company famous for constantly developing something new and keeping up with the latest advancements; Apple Inc. now plans to bring AI on iPhones with the help of a new chip called- Apple Neural Engine. The tech giant is reportedly developing a new processor that will be dedicatedly used for handling the AI-based tasks. Tasks like speech and face recognition in products like iPhones will be possible with the Apple Neural Engine. Even more, this new Apple chip could also help Apple to power the software used for self-driving technology in cars and AR. Bloomberg reported the news of AI on iPhones with the help of Apple Neural Engine chips, saying that it could even help improve the battery of iPhones. AI on iPhones after Siri Notably, Apple Inc. is one of the early tech companies, who kicked off the use of AI technology and software with Siri in 2011. Siri is a tool helping the user to operate his smartphone by voice commands. But now, Apple plans to bring AI to its chips that will be dedicated specifically for the AI-based tasks, according to a familiar source, reports Bloomberg. While Apple declined a comment on this, the source revealed some details after requesting anonymity to Bloomberg. This chip is internally known as the Apple Neural Engine which is obviously not made public yet. It will improve the way in which Apple’s devices handle tasks requiring human intelligence; tasks like speech and face recognition. A Race towards Leading the AI Technology Apple may have been the first to introduce the use of AI technology with its Siri. But now, it seems like the tech giant is way far behind many other companies who are already leading in the field of AI technology. Alphabet Inc. is using AI in its Google Home Assistant; while Amazon is seeing heaps of success and accolades with its Amazon Echo, Amazon Dot, and Amazon Alexa devices. So, to integrate latest technologies in its devices and stay up-to-date with the pace of technological advancements of the market; the Cupertino company definitely has to come up with AI-packed powerful chips. Gene Munster says that Apple is betting its future on two crucial areas that require AI. Adding to this, he mentions that Artificial Intelligence (AI) is at the core of self-driving cars and Augmented reality (AR). Munster is a former Apple analyst, and also the co-founder of the Venture Capital (VC) firm Loup Ventures. Significantly, AI is the future; competitors already ruling the market with AI-based devices; Apple Inc. should certainly buck up in its game of developing the AI technology; be it for self-driving cars or for using AI on iPhones.

If rumors are any indication, however, it seems that not only would the 10.5-inch iPad Pro 2 live up to the hype, it would also enter the market far earlier than expected. The Cupertino-based tech giant’s tablet sales have been in a slump for years now, with interest in slates decreasing as smartphones get larger displays. Apart from this, numerous users of Apple’s iPads have opted to keep their devices for years, which translated to lost sales and revenue for newer models. Things were shaken up a little bit, however, with the introduction of the iPad Pro series, comprised of a 12.9-inch model and a smaller, slightly more advanced 9.7-inch variant that was released early last year. The two iPad Pros were an entirely different breed of tablets, in the way that they are targeted toward the enterprise market and power users. With hefty specs and a couple of advanced accessories, the iPad Pro series has been dubbed by Apple as the next big thing in personal computing. So far, however, the limitations of iOS has limited the iPad Pros’ potential, and both the 12.9-inch and 9.7-inch variants have pretty much become niche devices. iPad Pro 2 & Apple Pencil 2 concept renderings. #Apple #iPad #iPadPro2 #ApplePencil2 #Concept #Rendering pic.twitter.com/2wTJW4GCTN —  iDesigner (@AppleiDesigner) May 9, 2017 If rumors about Apple’s 2017 tablets are any indication, however, it appears that the Cupertino-based tech giant is preparing to pull out all stops to ensure that 2017’s iPad series would be serious competitors in the computing industry. According to speculations, Apple would be doing this by releasing four tablets this year, a budget device, a refresh for the 12.9-inch and 9.7-inch Pros, and a new 10.5-inch device that would incorporate numerous advances never before seen in an Apple tablet, according to a MacWorld report. The 10.5-inch iPad Pro is rumored to be released with a similar form factor as the 9.7-inch iPad variant. For this to happen, Apple would need to decrease the size of the 10.5-inch iPad’s bezels radically. Over the past few months, renders of the upcoming device have emerged with concepts depicting a full-screen iPad. Considering that the feature might be exclusive to the iPhone 8 this year, however, there is a good chance that the 10.5-inch iPad Pro would still feature a classic Home Button, albeit with far smaller bezels as its predecessors. First attempt at a concept for the iPad Pro 2. With same edge to edge design as iPhone 8. Never done this before. What do you think? pic.twitter.com/K7outWaM3s — Tailosive Tech (@tailosivetech) May 7, 2017 One thing that has struck Apple fans is the rumor that the 10.5-inch iPad Pro would be equipped with the most advanced display that the tech giant has ever released for a tablet. According to a PC Advisor report, developers have found references to 120fps displays in Xcode, which has been interpreted widely as Apple fitting the 10.5-inch slate with a screen that has an impressively quick refresh rate. The current 12.9-inch and 9.7-inch iPad Pros have 60Hz displays, which, while capable enough for conventional applications, still lags at times when using the Apple Pencil to create content. With a 120Hz display, however, even the most taxing graphics applications would be handled by the 10.5-inch iPad Pro 2 with ease. Of course, the critically acclaimed, yet surprisingly rare True Tone display that is found in the 9.7-inch iPad Pro is expected to be fitted on the 10.5-inch iPad Pro 2 as well. The feature, which automatically optimizes the display depending on the ambient light, has received nothing but praise from consumers and critics alike. Despite this, however, Apple has yet to release another slate with the advanced feature. Thus, the 10.5-inch iPad Pro might very well be the device that would debut the feature once more. If rumors prove accurate, the 10.5-inch iPad Pro 2 would see a release this coming June, during Apple’s WWDC 2017. While the tech giant has not confirmed the launch, noted Apple analysts such as KGI’s Ming-Chi Kuo have stated that the chances of the tech giant revealing the 10.5-inch flagship slate on the developers’ conference are very high. Pricing for the 10.5-inch iPad Pro 2 remains unknown, though speculations are high that the device would start at around $699 for the base 32GB model.

(Make your mind up will you?) Going from Apple-powered devices to Google's platform is either ridiculously easy or rather taxing, depending on your current setup. Image: Alex Cranz/Gizmodo Do you Google? Good news if you're already heavily invested in the Google ecosystem on your iPhone. You can switch to Android in an hour or two and keep your evening free for seeing friends or browsing Netflix. Otherwise, better cancel those evening plans. Those of you who spend all your time in Gmail, Google Calendar and Google Maps for iOS can simply install those apps on your brand new Android device, sign in using your Google account credentials, and pick up where you left off. The same applies for Google Photos and Google Drive. Google Drive can handle contacts and calendars for you. Image: Google Unlike Apple, Google doesn't have a dedicated app to help you defect to its mobile OS, but it does have a website with a lot of the information you're going to need: essentially you're instructed to use Google Drive to copy over contacts, photos, videos and calendar entries, which we'll cover in more detail below. If you're thinking about switching from iOS to Android in the future, or like to swap mobile OSes on a regular basis, then Google's cloud-centric services make the task much easier — so your best off keeping all your data there. By contrast, the only official Apple app you can get on Android at the moment is Apple Music. Messages and emails Extricating yourself from iMessage is perhaps the biggest challenge facing those jumping ship to Android. iMessage doesn't work on Google's platform, and there's no way to export all your message history into a comparable Android app. You're going to have to say goodbye to iMessage, but you can at least ensure a clean break. As soon as you know you're making the move go into your iOS and navigate to Messages in Settings and turn iMessage off, then go to FaceTime in Settings and turn that off too. Apple's full instructions are here. If you have some precious iMessages or plain old SMSes you can't leave behind, you'll need to rely on third-party software and some rather convoluted processes to back it all up. iSMS2droid promises to import messages from an unencrypted backup you made in iTunes on your computer into Android. If you don't need the backup on your phone, then PhoneView (macOS) and CopyTrans (Windows) are two of many tools that will let you browse your old missives to your heart's content. It's goodbye to iMessage. Image: Screenshot As for emails, Apple's system supports IMAP, so you can carry on checking your iCloud emails through Gmail on Android if you're not having a fresh start and giving up your old email address completely. Tap the drop-down arrow on the Gmail app menu, choose Add account, and follow the configuration instructions provided by Apple. It's the same process if you're using any other kind of email app on your new Android device, like Outlook from Microsoft. The only requirement is that it supports the popular IMAP protocol. You have a couple of other options if putting your iCloud account directly into Gmail doesn't appeal. You can have all your Apple iCloud emails automatically forwarded to your new Gmail address, by going into iCloud Mail on the web and setting up forwarding — you can even delete the originals after they're passed on. Alternatively, you can export all your old emails using Mail on a Mac just in case you ever need them again, then close down your Apple account. Contacts and calendars As long as you just want to make a one-way, one-time switch from iOS to Android, then Google Drive for iOS makes the process of moving contacts and calendars over simple enough. Once you've got the app installed on your iOS device, open the menu then tap Settings and Backup. Choose the data you want to transfer across to the equivalent Google accounts, tap Start Backup and you're on your way — everything from iOS and iCloud gets picked up. Make sure you're on wi-fi, and the iPhone is plugged in during the switchover. Also note, that any previous backups you've done will be overwritten. macOS can help make switching calendars easier. Image: Screenshot If you want a two-way sync, which you might if you're using your Android phone with an Apple laptop, then it's a lot more complicated. The best option, really, is to switch to using Google contacts and calendars as much as you can, and then adding your Google account to the relevant apps in macOS (Add Account from the main app menu in both cases). Even then you need to make sure you're always adding events to the Google calendars (or contacts) and not the iCloud ones for them to show up on your phone. If you absolutely must keep both Google and iCloud services running concurrently, and syncing with each other, then you'll need to put your trust in a third-party app for macOS or Android. Photos and videos Since Google Photos came into the world it's actually pretty easy to get all your personal photos and videos moved over to Android, via Google's servers, as long as they're all still on your iPhone: Install Google Photos for iOS, opt to back everything up, and away you go. You can either pay Google for storage and keep everything at full resolution, or accept some resizing (images max out at 16 MP, videos at 1080p), and store as many photos and videos as you like on the web, free of charge. The process is even more straightforward if you use the Google Drive app as we described in the section above, and Google Photos even supports Live Photos these days, using those extra few frames of animation to create a GIF for you. The only negative is that the albums you've created in iOS don't get copied over (everything appears as one long list of pictures), so you need to create them again. Google Photos can transfer images and videos. (Image: Google) All that is easy enough but if you've got photos in iCloud you've moved off your iPhone then you might have a problem or two on your hands. As we explained in our full guide to the topic of switching between Apple Photos and Google Photos, just about the only option open to you is downloading them all from iCloud to a macOS or Windows machine then uploading them again using a Google Photos client. It's a little convoluted but it's manageable, and it's a lot easier than using the export options in iCloud on the web, which are practically non-existent. If you don't have a computer to act as the middleman between iCloud Photo Library and Google Photos then you're stuck — you'll have to borrow a laptop from someone. Music and movies As we now have Apple Music on Android, getting your iTunes music on your Android device is no longer the exercise in frustration it once was. As far as tunes you've actually purchased directly from iTunes, it's probably the best option out there, though you do need to have signed up for an Apple Music subscription to be able to use the app and get at your purchases. Otherwise, it depends on where your music is and how it's stored. Any plain old MP3s you were syncing to your iPhone from iTunes can be uploaded to Google Play Music instead (50,000 of them can be stored for free), or you can use something like DoubleTwist, which is just about the leading choice if you want to keep on using iTunes alongside Android for your music. If you're signed up for Spotify you just need the Android app. Apple Music, now on Android. Image: Screenshot Likewise, if you've been accessing all your movies and TV shows through Netflix, Plex or Google Play Movies & TV then you just need to find and install the relevant app for Android and you're ready to go. All these services let you stream to multiple devices from a single account, so you can carry on using your iOS device if you need to. However, any videos you've purchased from iTunes won't run on Android at all — there's just no app to do it unless Apple ever gets around to making one. Several tools out there will do the job of removing iTunes DRM for you, but since we're getting into murky legal territory with that, we'll leave you to discover them for yourself. If you've invested hundreds of dollars in an iTunes digital library then you can still watch it on macOS, Windows, and the Apple TV, but not Android. Apps and games Generally speaking, all the apps you use on your iPhone are going to be available on Android as well, though there are a few exceptions — like Overcast and Day One. In terms of paid-for apps, you're going to have to pay for them all again, unfortunately, though something like a Spotify subscription buys you access on both Android and iOS. Whether all your data (from documents to saved games) moves over with you is another matter and worth checking up on before you make the switch. If you're in any doubt, get in touch with the developer directly to see what the situation is (you might be out of luck with anything that relies heavily on the iCloud storage system). Some paid-for iOS games, like Alto's Adventure, are free to play on Android. (Image: Noodlecake Studios Inc) We can't give you a guide to everything out there, but think about your productivity, fitness, and banking apps. Assess how much data is stored locally and what's going to happen to it. If you can, keep your old iPhone and new Android phone running alongside each other for a while until you're certain everything's been moved over successfully without too many bumps in the road. You might not believe it if you've read everything that's above, but moving from iOS to Android is actually much easier than it used to be, thanks mainly to an increased focus on cloud services (even, belatedly, from Apple itself). As long as you take your time, and don't live your life inside iMessage, you don't have to feel daunted by the task.

Android though? It would constantly hassle and nag me to create a gmail and convert my custom domain google account into an alias. No thanks. All major phone OS support exchange or imap, if you use it for syncing your emails, calendar and contacts it doesn't matter what phone you buy, or if you lose your phone, you will always get them back. Don't get suckered into ANY walled garden whether it be Apple, Google, or even your ISP's email (especially the awful pop3 options). They all exist to keep you as a customer and make moving inconvenient, without offering any real benefit. I have moved from iOS, to Windows Phone, to Android and back to iOS without going through any of the bullcrap in this article, because I set up exchange email/contact/calendar sync from the very beginning on my first smartphone. Now with Windows 10, all the exact same things are synced live. Just make sure your photos are backed up, especially if they're the only place you have 4000 photo's of your children, and you're free of the shackles Apple and Google hope to restrain you. Reply -3 mark_d @mark_d May 29, 2017, 11:46am It would constantly hassle and nag me to create a gmail and convert my custom domain google account into an alias. No thanks. Not once has android ever asked me to convert my custom domain to a gmail service. Try again. Any gmail account is required to use the app store. Gosh, who would have thought just like Apple. Don't get suckered into ANY walled garden whether it be Apple, Google, or even your ISP's email 100% agreed.

Some devices can benefit quite a bit from root and customisation, particularly those afflicted by bloat or lower end hardware. Some software relies on root to work. The vast majority of users don't need it and probably don't even know what it is. Reply 0 mark_d @mark_d May 29, 2017, 11:48am Why do iPhone users have to root the phones by their owners?

Reply 0 soldant @soldant May 29, 2017, 4:34pm You can't selectively sync though, and it still keeps a local copy that chews up local storage. There's no way to really control it. One of the best parts of syncing is the ability to move stuff off local storage (especially given how absurdly expensive storage is on iOS devices).

Generate Enquiries for your Business by Listing on Economictimes.com List Your Business Find Service Near You By Mishi Choudhary and Eben Moglen The world's major societies are now wrestling with the enormous social power wielded by the internet's “platform companies“.In Europe they speak of “GAFA“: Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon.Twitter, Uber and other aspirant companies hover just out of the main ring. Billions of people provide data about their personal lives and business activities to these companies, which are using that data as leverage to change human behaviour to their economic advantage.Governments everywhere see them as rivals to their power and also invaluable allies. India and its government too face immense challenges, but also an extraordinary opportunity , if GoI can lead India in the right direction. Essentially , three basic approaches to deal with the power of these American data miners have emerged. First, the US government sees them as pillars of post-industrial American power, and as an immense national security intelligence resource. It is therefore their strategic ally. Second, proponents of “digital sovereignty“, mostly autocracies, have chosen to build national search engines and social media structures, favouring domestic private market entrants (as has happened in Russia and China), and by exercising control over national telecommunications networks to block the US companies. Third, the European Union has attempted to control the companies' behaviour by regulation and litigation. Europe's open and democratic societies have been as fully colonised by the platforms as the US: the plurality of their citizens' email is read by Google, most of their citizens' social and family lives are surveilled by Facebook, and so on. The European Commission and national governments mostly attempt to regulate the companies through competition and “data protection“ law, both of which assume that profiting by collecting information about customers and their behaviour is essentially legitimate, and that the states' functions should be to require a “level playing field“ for local companies, and the acquisition of uninformed “opt-in“ clocks from the citizens whose intimate lives are being commoditised. Even the pursuit of these very narrow neo-liberal goals, however, means undertaking vastly expensive and complex litigation against the platform companies, expending time and taxpayers' money on the largest scale, with uncertain results at best. India has a golden opportunity to find a fourth way . The market in internet services ­ that is, information technology for use by people in their daily lives ­ is now dominated by companies that provide “free“ services in return for massive privacy invasion. This model, in which the consumer is the product, is doing enormous harm to the human race and destroying our privacy environment completely , in order to provide people supposedly “free“ email and other forms of social communication, calendaring and similar services “in the cloud“. Autocratic “digital sovereignty“ like China or Russia cannot be India's way: more than any other society , India stands to benefit economically from the open worldwide Net. No Indian government can afford to use its law officers, its Competition Commission and its taxpayers' money to spend years litigating with Google, Microsoft, or Facebook over individual business practices, in the European style. But to take an American free-market position with respect to the US platform companies is to endorse an immense act of digital colonialism, in which the private lives of more than a billion Indian citizens are delivered “free“ to the data miners. India's greatest advantages in 21st century global economic competition are the intelligence and education of its people. Software and network-based service industries are core components of any Digital India economic strategy .European countries intuit that spending hundreds of millions of euros and years in litigation with Google over whether search results prioritise Google services contributes less to European welfare than building a European business that would compete with Google globally . But this isn't aerospace and they don't know how. India can. India can invent competition that challenges not just the platform companies but their basic, anti-environmental business model. Indian internet companies can provide global digital service platforms that protect, rather than destroy, privacy . Indian internet industries can provide reasonably priced, universally available, privacy respecting services that compete directly with services provided by the US data miners, priced reasonably in local terms in all the developed and developing societies. Indian industries, providing state-of the-art cloud services ­ social networking, email, travel, calendaring, on-line retailing everywhere, etc ­ could very profitably , given Indian cost structures, compete to provide those services to everyone in the world who has seen the error of “free“ services based on privacy invasion, and wants an alternative she can pay for, with confidence in the privacy technology that is all open source, and works in their interest rather than someone else's. This is “for-profit, pro-privacy IT for humanity .“ And because of the economies of scale in this business, industry will be able to provide Indians with deeply subsidised or no-cost services, based not on invading or selling their privacy to multinationals, but as a consequence of the redistributive effect of selling first world consumers their data privacy as an export industry . As a method of restoring competitive health to an industry , nothing succeeds like competition. India can not only secure its strategic economic role in the 21st century global order, not only provide its own people with a chance to raise themselves by serving their own needs and the world's, but also help restore the privacy environment for all humanity by controlling the platform companies directly , positively, profitably, by making a better mousetrap. The world will beat a path to India's door. (Mishi Choudhary is a technology lawyer.

_ Macworld Australia MAC iPad iPhone iSnap App Guide Gadget Guide mResell HOME NEWS FEATURES REVIEWS HELP/TIPS BLOGS Mac In Business Communications Productivity Security Workflow FORUM MAGAZINE Digital Subscription Current Issue Back Issues Apple’s iOS Setting app needs a major UI overhaul Kirk McElhearn 29 May, 2017 View more articles fromthe author AAA Comments News When you set up a new iPhone or iPad, a few screens walk you through some of the most important settings for the device. You’re asked to enter your Apple ID and password; you’re asked if you want to use location services; and you get queried about Siri. But beyond that, iOS starts working with a slew of default settings. It’s up to you to find them, figure them out and tweak them. Unfortunately, the iOS Settings app can be confusing. It’s hard to find what you need to change and some settings are buried in sub-sub-sub-menus. I count 44 different top-level settings categories on my iPhone and then 84 more because third-party apps also have entries, many of which contain options that are also found in the Location, Notifications, Background App Refresh, Cellular Data and Privacy settings. Few of them contain any actual app settings, and those that do also provide access to those settings from the individual apps. If I add up the iOS settings and the app settings, I have a total of 128 top-level entries in the Settings app. And many users will have more than that, because they have more apps on their devices. (For some reason, I don’t always see these third-party app settings on my iPhone or iPod touch, but I do see them on both my iPads. When I started writing this article, they were not to be found on my smaller devices; the next day, when I was revising my draft, they were visible. Some users have reported this issue. This is a problem because there may be app settings that I cannot access on certain devices.) Fortunately, back in iOS 9, Apple added an option to search the Settings app. It wasn’t visible though; you had to pull down on the screen to access a search box. In iOS 10, Apple changed this and the search box is always visible. So if you’re trying to find a specific setting, you should be able to type its name in the search box and find it, right? Not really. If you search for “Automatic Downloads,” an iTunes Store setting, you can’t find it from the search box; if you want to find the “Enable 4G” setting, searching won’t help; and so on. Many settings don’t show up in the search box and, while I could figure out where to find these, the search box is also a shortcut to not have to scroll and tap to get to a buried setting. But the Settings app is still confusing. It’s hard to know where to look for many of the settings, and if you don’t know what a specific setting is called, you won’t be able to search for it. In addition, there’s no help for the settings; some have text explanations, but you can’t have tooltips, or a Help icon in iOS, to provide more information. I think Apple needs to rethink the way the Settings app works, and the way settings are organised. There are hundreds of discrete settings, making it very confusing to really get a handle on how things work on iOS. In addition, the existence of third-party app settings in the Settings app is wrong. In the early days of iOS, when there were few apps, this may have made sense, but it’s more logical to look for app settings in the apps. It’s also easier to access them, since you don’t need to switch to the Settings app, perhaps change a setting, return to the third-party app to check how something looks, switch back, and so on. Apple does a good job of choosing default settings that work for most users, but every user eventually needs to change some settings. It would be great if this were easier.

Ravi Shankar Prasad, the federal minister for Electronics and IT said, government officials were in touch with Apple and other mobile phone manufacturers for expanding facilities and setting up new plants. Cupertino, California-based Apple last week started making iPhone SE at its Taiwanese contract manufacturer Wistron’s plant in Bengaluru. A small batch of locally made iPhones was rolled out initially, meant as a test for the manufacturing facility. A select few local shops were stocking the “Made in India” iPhones since 2 May, and the manufacturing of the devices had been completed in April itself. The Indian government has agreed to provide Apple with tax concessions on the import of components to be used in the locally made iPhones. Apple had sought a 15 year tax holiday for all imported components, a demand which was rejected. A panel of ministries instead offered concessions on the components that could not be manufactured in India. “Today, almost all the big companies of the world are coming to India because of the sheer pull of India’s market,” Prasad has said.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 29 May 2017 Apple bringing artificial intelligence to chips Booming field: A man uses his phone as he walks past an Apple store in Beijing. Engineers at Apple are racing to catch their peers at Amazon.com Inc and Alphabet Inc in the booming field of AI. — Reuters SAN FRANCISCO: Apple Inc got an early start in artificial intelligence (AI) software with the 2011 introduction of Siri, a tool that lets users operate their smartphones with voice commands. Now the electronics giant is bringing artificial intelligence to chips. Apple is working on a processor devoted specifically to AI-related tasks, according to a person familiar with the matter. The chip, known internally as the Apple Neural Engine, would improve the way the company’s devices handle tasks that would otherwise require human intelligence – such as facial recognition and speech recognition, said the person, who requested anonymity discussing a product that hasn’t been made public. Apple declined to comment. Engineers at Apple are racing to catch their peers at Amazon.com Inc and Alphabet Inc in the booming field of AI. While Siri gave Apple an early advantage in voice-recognition, competitors have since been more aggressive in deploying AI across their product lines, including Amazon’s Echo and Google’s Home digital assistants. An AI-enabled processor would help Cupertino, California-based Apple integrate more advanced capabilities into devices, particularly cars that drive themselves and gadgets that run augmented reality, the technology that superimposes graphics and other information onto a person’s view of the world. “Two of the areas that Apple is betting its future on require AI,” said Gene Munster, former Apple analyst and co-founder of venture capital firm Loup Ventures. “At the core of augmented reality and self-driving cars is artificial intelligence.” Apple devices currently handle complex AI processes with two different chips: the main processor and the graphics chip. The new chip would let Apple offload those tasks onto a dedicated module designed specifically for demanding AI processing, allowing Apple to improve battery performance. Should Apple bring the chip out of testing and development, it would follow other semiconductor makers that have already introduced dedicated AI chips. Qualcomm Inc’s latest Snapdragon chip for smartphones has a module for handling AI tasks, while Google announced its first chip, called the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), in 2016. That chip worked in Google’s data centres to power search results and image-recognition. At its I/O conference this year, Google announced a new version that will be available to clients of its cloud business. Nvidia Corp also sells a similar chip to cloud customers. The Apple AI chip is designed to make significant improvements to Apple’s hardware over time, and the company plans to eventually integrate the chip into many of its devices, including the iPhone and iPad, according to the person with knowledge of the matter. Apple has tested prototypes of future iPhones with the chip, the person said, adding that it is unclear if the component would be ready this year. Apple’s operating systems and software features would integrate with devices that include the chip. For example, Apple has considered offloading facial recognition in the photos application, some parts of speech recognition, and the iPhone’s predictive keyboard to the chip, the person said. Apple also planned to offer developer access to the chip so third-party apps can also offload AI-related tasks, the person said. Apple may choose to discuss some of its latest advancements in AI at its annual developer’s conference in June. At the same conference, Apple planned to introduce iOS 11, its new operating system for iPhones and iPads, with an updated user-interface, people with knowledge of the matter said last month. The company is also said to discuss updated laptops with faster chips from Intel Corp. An AI chip would join a growing list of processors that Apple has created in-house. The company began designing its own main processors for the iPhone and iPad in 2010 with the A4 chip. It has since released dedicated processors to power the Apple Watch, the motion sensors across its products, the wireless components inside of its AirPods, and the fingerprint scanner in the MacBook Pro. The company has also tested a chip to run the low-power mode on Mac laptops. In 2015, Bloomberg reported that Apple’s culture of secrecy stymied the iPhone maker’s ability to attract top AI research talent. Since then, Apple has acquired multiple companies with deep ties to AI, has begun publishing papers related to AI research, has joined a key research group and has made hires from the field. In October 2016, Apple hired Russ Salakhutdinov from Carnegie Mellon University as its director of AI research. — Bloomberg Tags / Keywords: Apple Related Stories Related Stories Apple and Nokia settle patent dispute and sign new deal Apple invests US$200mil in Corning Apple becomes first US firm to top US$800bil value Apple market cap larger than the economies of 45 of the 50 US states Bosch wins IPhone orders in blow to InvenSense You May Be Interested Voir Holdings looking to enter construction and logistics Trading ideas: Mah Sing, YTL Reit, KPJ Healthcare Poor showing at Sudirman Cup costs Vivian-Khe Wei place in world meet Get smart about the idiot box The man who rebuilt this city Racing for a better tomorrow Others Also Read SoftBank’s tech fund rankles VCs as valuations soar Chew: Come to us for help Muguruza hoping to avoid embarrassing exit in Paris Property Related advertisement Latest News Samsung Elec considers adding capacity at China chip plant S&P sees no need for an out-of-schedule China rating review Hong Leong Bank Q3 net profit up 14% AirAsia warns of free ticket scam Market to continue range-bound trading Most Viewed in Business AirAsia warns of free ticket scam Bank Negara kicks off fintech sandbox Boustead records RM2.38bil revenue YTL REIT buys Majestic Hotel for RM380mil cash Voir Holdings looking to enter construction and logistics Online traders must register with CCM Ringgit opens slightly lower against US dollar ML Global banks on orderbook to sustain Zukri: Islamic banking sector ripe for M&As Foreign buying stretches to 16 consecutive weeks advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)
Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 29 May 2017 Acquisitions accelerate as tech giants seek to build AI SAN FRANCISCO: A total of 34 artificial intelligence (AI) start-ups were acquired in the first quarter of this year, more than twice the amount of activity in the year-ago quarter, according to the research firm CB Insights. Tech giants seeking to reinforce their leads in AI or make up for lost ground have been the most aggressive buyers. Alphabet Inc’s Google has acquired 11 AI start-ups since 2012, the most of any firm, followed by Apple Inc, Facebook Inc and Intel Corp, respectively, according to CB Insights. The companies declined to comment on their acquisition strategies. A spokesman for Apple did confirm the company’s recent purchase of Lattice Data, a start-up that specialises in working with unstructured data. The first quarter also saw one of the largest deals to date as Ford Motor Co invested US$1bil in Argo AI, founded by former executives on self-driving teams at Google and Uber Technologies Inc. Start-ups are looking to go deep on applications of AI to specific fields, such as health and retail, industry observers say, rather than compete directly with established companies. — Reuters Tags / Keywords: Startups Related Stories Related Stories Rocket Internet narrows losses, boosts sales at key startups Research tool to track animals’ brain activity US startups load up on debt "Investing for good' gains appeal amid rocky tech startup market Discontent among startup community in Sweden You May Be Interested CIMB Research downgrades Affin to hold Hong Leong Bank Q3 net profit up 14% Poor showing at Sudirman Cup costs Vivian-Khe Wei place in world meet Get smart about the idiot box The man who rebuilt this city Racing for a better tomorrow Others Also Read Teacher accused of molesting 15 girls in class More US tourists coming to our shores soon SoftBank’s tech fund rankles VCs as valuations soar Property Related advertisement Latest News Samsung Elec considers adding capacity at China chip plant S&P sees no need for an out-of-schedule China rating review Hong Leong Bank Q3 net profit up 14% AirAsia warns of free ticket scam Market to continue range-bound trading Most Viewed in Business AirAsia warns of free ticket scam Bank Negara kicks off fintech sandbox Boustead records RM2.38bil revenue YTL REIT buys Majestic Hotel for RM380mil cash Voir Holdings looking to enter construction and logistics Online traders must register with CCM Ringgit opens slightly lower against US dollar ML Global banks on orderbook to sustain Zukri: Islamic banking sector ripe for M&As Foreign buying stretches to 16 consecutive weeks advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

News sign-up Customer centricity is still key for brands News, 29 May 2017 Topics Customer-centricity Brand & customer experience SYDNEY/SINGAPORE: There is no doubt that innovation is important for winning over consumers, but customer centricity and good design continue to have the edge, according to two senior industry researchers. Brian Prentice and Olive Huang, both VPs of research at Gartner, said that creating a great customer experience does not depend solely on being innovative and that brands risk losing out if they ignore customer centricity. Speaking to The Drum, Prentice cited tech giant Apple and Uber, the app-based transport firm, as good examples of companies that achieve high rates of customer loyalty and satisfaction by focusing on experience and design. "Organisations that are more design centric appear to be more innovative than the R&D dollars they spend," he said. "Apple, for example, spends a fraction of R&D compared to Samsung, but their market capitalisation is higher and they seem to have a higher degree of customer satisfaction and loyalty than Samsung does." Similarly, he argued that Uber's use of the cloud and geo-location updates are hardly ground-breaking innovative features, yet "they put it together in a way that is a great experience". "If you don't have good design, you're relying on really, really good technical implementation which may not work," he warned. Today's consumers are changing, added Olive Huang, who said they are now looking for different levels of engagement which brands should not ignore. "If you look at the technology, 40% of all data analytics projects is about customer experience. If you talk about digital transformation, you have the possibilities to get more insights, they look at the data and what they can do to improve the experience," she said. "It is really moving from how do I generate more leads through marketing, to how do I continuously engage the customer in their lifecycle? You then have customer experience becoming the competitive edge," she added. According to Huang, brands face two main challenges when seeking to improve the customer experience they offer. The first concerns how traditional organisations are set up, making the mistake of regarding each customer lifecycle as "individual compartmentalised cycles" rather than recognising that many purchase decisions nowadays involve consumers evaluating information and engaging all at the same time. Secondly, over-reliance on technology can be a major problem if it comes at the expense of human interaction. "Over-engineering is a big problem," she said. "The human factor of the customer experience is very important, and organisations that push customers to only digital channels to save costs will see the customer experience drops."

Originally from John’s Creek, Georgia, Davis is a self-described “southern Jewish girl” living out her dreams in the Big Apple. As a sought-after dating coach, the Georgetown University alum connects singles to each other the old-fashioned way — in person, without the use of dating apps. She’s also helped invigorate the city’s Shabbat scene for singles by organizing more than two-dozen “Shabbatness” dinners, a highly coveted but invite-only experience. Four months ago, the Millennial matchmaker took a “leap of faith” by performing a 6-minute set at Manhattan’s Gotham Comedy Club. During that fateful evening, Davis met sit-com legend Jerry Seinfeld, who also performed. After appearing in several more shows at Gotham, Davis had the honor of Seinfeld “opening” for her during a March performance. “I got in and I got lucky,” said Davis in an interview with The Times of Israel. Having performed a dozen sets in New York and Las Vegas since January, the blossoming comedienne cannot get enough of the spotlight, she said. “I’m addicted,” said Davis of performing. “I’m one of those freaks who gets an endorphin rush from this. I want to push myself to try new material and to improve, to push myself to be uncomfortable,” she said. In making hay of her personal life, Davis takes audiences back to her childhood in Georgia, where her parents met and courted at a Denny’s restaurant. As a teenager growing up outside Atlanta, Davis willed herself to lose 60 pounds and forge a new self-image, and the last laugh is on her audiences. ‘Even worse than being fat and Jewish in Georgia is being hairy’ “Even worse than being fat and Jewish in Georgia is being hairy,” Davis told the crowd at a recent Gotham show. After explaining the perils of being attracted to men who range in age from 22 to 62, Davis revealed that one of her eyebrows was accidentally — but permanently — waxed off by her unibrow-fearing mother. “After many years I just got sick of penciling it in every day,” said Davis. “So I got it tattooed on, and now I’m a Jew with a tattoo,” said the petite comic. As the granddaughter of Holocaust survivors, the “Jew with a tattoo” line is the closest Davis would go to joking about the Shoah, she said. “It’s never okay to joke about it. I think the Holocaust should always be off-limits,” said Davis, who has visited several former Nazi camps with American Jewish Committee delegations. Erin Davis serves food at a mixer in New York City, September 2016 (Courtesy) Davis’s survivor grandparents — Roza and Kissel Goldberg — have long been her inspiration, she said. The couple met while hiding from the Nazis in occupied Poland, each having lost many family members. Their love story, noted Davis, underpins her most cherished matchmaking project: the staging of “Shabbatness” dinners for single Jews on the prowl, always held in private homes and “with lots of booze,” she said. During the weeks before each gathering, Davis carefully selects who will fill the 12 seats. Having paid $72 to attend a Friday evening, participants come with expectations. Last year, two couples who met during “Shabbatness” dinners got married, and many others are still dating, said Davis. To kick off 2017 with something new, Davis organized her first all-male gay dinner in December — “a big brisket dinner with a ‘Jew Year’s Eve’ theme and of course a rainbow challah,” said the Spanish-speaking socialite. Erin Davis participates in a panel about love at Beverly Hills Studios, April 2017 (Courtesy) “I am a slave to these dinners,” said Davis, known for a trademark mini-skirt and high-heels. “I don’t sit at the table or eat. I run ice-breakers and deal with people who are coming in nervous,” she said. With some dinners lasting several hours past midnight, all kinds of relationships can form around the table. “We have business deals come out of these dinners, and we have bromances. When people come together for a shared experience, anything can happen,” said Davis, who is “happily seeing” a man she set herself up with one year ago. ‘Momentum is everything in dating’ As a sought-after dating coach, Davis encounters clients who are unable to break into the dating scene. “‘Can you get me out of my apartment and to an event you think I would like?’ is the most common request I get,” said the animal-loving Davis. She said many young adults are “overwhelmed” by the city’s Jewish community. To cater to this demographic, Davis became a “wing-woman,” taking her clients to bars and events where she can connect them to potential mates herself. A 2016 photo of Erin Davis, founder of ‘Shabbatness’ in New York City and celebrated dating coach (Courtesy) “I am the ice-breaker, I am the wing woman, I do it,” said Davis. “I am the flirt and I run over and connect people. I want them to meet in an organic and wholesome way,” said the effusive coach, who also helps clients avoid common dating mistakes. “The biggest mistake that people make after coming to an event like ‘Shabbatness’ is trying to go out with only their top choice first,” said Davis. “They wait too long to contact the second person. No, no, no! Contact them all right away, because momentum is everything in dating,” said Davis, who will soon be a certified personal trainer. In addition to her Holocaust survivor maternal grandparents, Davis was influenced by the lives of her father’s parents. Their relationship, too, was forged by working through obstacles together. ‘My grandparents’ perseverance and commitment to each was inspiring’ “My grandparents were both deaf,” said Davis. “My dad was an only child born with hearing and full speaking ability, but American Sign Language is his first language,” she said. “My grandparents’ perseverance and commitment to each was inspiring,” said Davis, who moved to New York City in 2010 with virtually no connections in town. Next up, the rising comic hopes to wrap negotiations for a reality TV show based on her romance gigs, said Davis. A wearer of many hats, she is also completing a graduate degree in international affairs at The New School, where Davis researched the role of “love as a bridge-builder between Judaism and other faiths.” Whether on stage with Seinfeld or leading a “Shabbat Shvitz” work-out, Davis said that one theme connects her endeavors to each other. “With all of my projects and businesses, I am trying to address modern Jewish love,” said the Millennial matchmaker.

The investor Alex Parent, 28, always wanted to invest in stocks but was too “scared” of the volatility and possibility of losing money. Then an investor friend managed to allay his fears, and helped him get going. “I was shocked how easy it was,” Mr. Parent says. How he invests “Before starting with real money, I went with a stock-market simulator,” he says. As his comfort level grew, he went to a bank and put money into a real account with its online discount brokerage. His only caution is that the bank “will try to pressure you into getting a financial adviser.” Mr. Parent is happy to invest on his own because he can get the information he needs online. He is discovering that it’s better to buy and hold stocks such as Shopify Inc., rather than trade in and out of them. His portfolio is earning 5 per cent to 15 per cent a month, he says. True, the economy and stocks can go down a lot, too. But studies show if you stay invested and ride out the downturns (or even buy more stocks), you’ll come out ahead in the long run. Best move The price of his Shopify stock has gone up more than 75 per cent since he bought in early February. Worst move He got a scare when he bought a security and sold it within a day or two. As it takes three days for a transaction to settle in a brokerage account, he didn’t put up any capital for the stock purchase. This kind of “free-riding” can result in a cash account being frozen. Advice “For my generation, having a stable job with a pension plan is very hard,” Mr. Parent adds. “I personally think that the stock market is a way out of this frustrating problem.” Want to be in Me and My Money?

An action-thriller novel — book 1 in the KESTREL series. ★★★★★ — Amazon Room To Think May 28th, 2017 tech & ipad-only 9 min read I had good intentions. I know that’s what everyone says, but it’s true. Seven years ago, when I set up my home office in our new place — I’ve worked from home full-time for more than a decade now, by the way — I took a photo of my then-unsullied desk. Here it is. It was an IKEA Galant, configured as a big, L-shaped monster of a thing. I was a consultant iOS and Mac software engineer, and I need a lot of tech gear. Big iMac, keyboard, pointing device, external drives, additional display, test devices, and so on. The clutter grew and grew. Latterly, by the middle of last year, I’d long since switched careers (I’m a writer now), and downsized my computing setup too: I was using just a 12” MacBook or 11” MacBook Air, and I sat at the short leg of the desk, having carved out a small, calm space within so much redundant stuff. I’d try not to notice the rest of it, but of course I always did. It took half an hour to properly dust the whole room. I wasn’t happy with it at all. When my little sister had to move here to Edinburgh for a few months for work, we naturally invited her to stay with us, and I jumped at the chance to finally clear out the office and turn it into a bedroom for her. After dropping my wife off at the airport very early one morning, I spent the whole day transforming the place, bidding a final goodbye to a room that had ceased to be a place of focus for me. Time moved on and little sis moved out, and this year my wife gave me the nudge I needed to do something I’d thought about since we bought the place: create the office I wanted, from scratch. The first thing needing attention was the wooden floor, which for reasons unknown the previous owner had painted magnolia. It looked awful, and was always a bone of contention for both of us. It needed professionally stripped and restored, and we decided to just go for it. Next, we’d have additional power sockets installed in several places, to give more flexibility in hiding away cables, and avoiding any extension blocks trailing around the room. Last but not least, the walls and ceiling needed fully stripped, repaired, plaster skimmed, and painted — including rewiring the ugly smoke alarm cabling back into the wall. We decided to go ahead and get all of it done in series, queuing up tradespeople to visit one after another, during a marathon two-week period. But first, I needed to know how I wanted it to look when it was done. I measured all the relevant surfaces and distances, made a model in Home Design 3D on the iPad, and came up with something radically different from before, to suit my iPad-only setup and my need for a minimalist workspace. Here’s the concept render. I’m a huge fan of feature walls, with a vivid colour to contrast against more subdued decor for the majority of the room. My favourite colour is purple (it was the highlight colour at our wedding, and I have two books out with covers in that colour), so it was an easy decision to choose it for the feature. I wanted clean, empty walls as a blank canvas. I can add some judicious art there later, but initially I wanted to keep the place as formless and distraction-free as I could. To that end, the only piece of furniture from the old office making a reappearance, besides my guitar and exercise bike, was my Aeron chair. The old desk was dead and gone, and far too large for my current needs anyway. I needed something smaller, simpler, and able to slot in below the window that looks out into the park. I chose an IKEA Bekant, again in the oak veneer but this time with white legs to match the woodwork, and with that decision made, we cleared the room, and invited the professionals in. Two weeks later, and having vacuumed, mopped, and wet-dusted more sanded-down plaster dust than I ever care to see again, I had a new office. Here’s how it looks. The guitar is a Fender American Special Stratocaster, maple neck, in Candy Apple Red. The puppy is a labradoodle, and his name is Whisky. Here’s a wider-angle view of the room, incorporating my old, reliable York c101 exercise bike. And here’s the desk. It’s the 140x60cm Bekant, lowered to about 70cm in height. The iPad is a 9.7” Pro, and its stand is from AboveTEK. The plant is faux-grass from IKEA. I’m not sure where the coaster is from, but I have three more just like it. The keyboard is an Apple Magic Keyboard, and there’s also an Apple Pencil in a Samdi holder. All the pens in the pot are black Staedtler pigment liners. I’m especially happy with how the floor turned out. It adds so much warmth and light to the room, and it’s now an element that I can actively enjoy, instead of trying to forget about it. With the exception of the adjoining purple feature-walls where the desk sits, the rest of the walls are a soft grey called turtledove, and all are blank. It has the effect of immediately blurring my visual focus — figuratively speaking — when I look at it, and turning my thoughts inward. That’s exactly what I wanted: a zero-distraction backdrop that pulls me back to what I’m actually thinking about. This is the view towards the door from my chair. The hook on the far wall is for the hatch in the floor, which conceals the stairway down into the basement. In the old office, I had a printer cabinet which protruded into the room, plus a filing cabinet at one end of the curved desk. In each case, the drawers and shelves were junkyards of chaos, and I had no real idea what was in there. Finding anything was an exercise in irritation, and because it wasn’t organised, I had no motivation to keep it tidy, so I regularly added more miscellaneous stuff and just allowed the annoyance and shame to be compounded. Urgh. It was very important to me to not allow things to get that way again. The printer nook is opposite the door, and is a recessed, shallow, open-shelved cupboard within a door-frame; a construct called an “Edinburgh Press”, from its historical use as a linen cupboard where tightly-folded and stacked items would be pressed flat by their confinement, thus keeping them relatively wrinkle-free. I was fortunate enough to find an IKEA unit — the Kullen 3-drawer chest — that fit the space nigh-perfectly, comfortably holding the laser printer. I built the unit but left the back open, so I could route cables inside it, and I’d previously had the electrician install a power socket inside the press itself, again to avoid ugly cables running along the edges of the floor. Here’s how it looks now. The top shelf of the press has a selection of books, including the classics of Computing Science that remind me of university, my previous career, where I came from, and my passion for order and logic. There’s also a series of design-related books that inspired and delighted me, and which I enjoy leafing through. In the middle, there are some nods to my new career, including my first novel, CHANGER. The relative position of each discipline is deliberate; writing a novel requires some of the skills from each of those two other fields, both of which had equal importance when I was writing code instead of words. The second shelf holds a Sound Blaster Roar Bluetooth speaker, which delivers an amazing amount of bass, and impressive clarity in the high range. The mono laser printer is Wirecutter’s recommendation: the Brother HL-L2340DW. Both devices are wired in for power, with the cabling concealed. What’s more important, though, is the drawers themselves. Mindful of the mess of the past, I bought a series of divider trays (with repositionable sub-dividers) and fabric dresser boxes, to carve up the space in the drawers and let me categorise and organise the various necessities of a modern home office — i.e. a lot of USB cables and white Apple adapters. The topmost drawer also has sections for personal items, stationery, and useful tools like a Leatherman, measuring tape, and LED flashlight. There’s some room to grow there, too, but any additions will have to earn their place. Concealed within, there are powered USB sockets to allow charging items with the drawers closed; I made those with USB plugs, USB male-to-female extension cables, and adhesive-mounted cable clips. I’m thrilled with how it all turned out. It’s just what I wanted, and when I open the door in the morning and walk in there, hearing Whisky’s claws clicking on the floor beside me as he makes for his new bed just behind my work area, I feel both energised and relaxed. My focus is immediately on the desk, with the calming vista of the grass hillside out beyond the window, curving down towards the river. The space outside has always been inspiring, but now the space inside no longer pales in comparison. It hasn’t been without stress and hassle, but it was absolutely worth it. I have a room that fits with my evolving sense of what I need from an environment for productivity, and I’m confident that it’s a place where I can get the next phase of my work done.

While the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) has refused to allow the company to sell its second-hand phones in the country, the government is still open to its request of allowing used handsets to be imported to meet Apple’s after-sale service contract. “We are still looking at their proposal of being allowed to import refurbished phones to meet their after-sale service requirements. The discussions are still on in that matter,” a DIPP official told BusinessLine. Allowing Apple to import its used phones into the country for meeting after-sale services requirement would essentially mean that the company be permitted to use the parts of such phones to service the i-phones sold in the country. “The DIPP has received such requests before for products such as photocopy machines and printers, where foreign companies have proposed that they be allowed to import second-hand parts to service products sold in the country,” said another official. “However, a positive decision has not been taken on any of the proposals yet.” The policy uncertainties notwithstanding, Apple started manufacturing its devices in India last week, at its Taiwanese contract manufacturing partner Wistron’s plant, in Bengaluru.

But there are all kinds of occasions for such gift giving, and you want the tech products you pick out to be extra-special, regardless. I have a handful of suggestions for tech-related gear that is attractive, practical and of the highest quality — I know because I’ve used it all. VOICE-CONTROLLED ASSISTANT Amazon’s Echo, a hands-free speaker you control with your voice, is a big hit. That’s partly because the personal assistant can do so much with vocal prompts: read you the news, play your favorite music, set alarms or timers, give you the weather forecast, summon an Uber, even adjust your home’s temperature and lighting if you have smart-home accessories installed. But the Echo is a big, somewhat ungainly cylinder, and a bit pricey at $180. Fear not: Amazon’s Echo Dot is more compact, and a lot less expensive at about $40 (and keep your eye out for deals). Its speaker is sub-par, but the Dot is intended for use with the standalone speakers folks tend to have around the house (I hooked my test Dot up to my trusty ol’ Apple Hi-Fi). And since the Dot has Bluetooth, the speakers turn into wireless gear. BLUETOOTH HEADPHONES Bluetooth headphones are a pain. Wirelessly pairing them to smartphones, tablets and computers can be tricky business, and good luck maintaining the connection. Wouldn’t it be great to have sound gear that just works — every time? Bose’s SoundLink Around-Ear Wireless Headphones II came pretty close for me — pairing them with computers and mobile gizmos was painless, for the most part. And I didn’t even use the headphones’ companion phone app. The SoundLinks sound decent and they are pretty comfortable. Best of all, they’re less expensive than some of Bose’s other, fancier wireless headphones, and as of this writing are steeply discounted — only $230. RELATED: Instead of cash and a personalized mug, these gifts give graduates a good start in life For something a bit more portable, check out Apple’s AirPods. These look just like the company’s EarPods, but without the cords. The $159 AirPods sound pretty good for the money, and stay in place even if you are working out. Phone calls are great on these babies, too. These will work the best with Apple devices — iPhones, iPads, Macs — but will pair up just fine with your Android phone, too. PORTABLE POWER PACKS You are lucky if the charge on your phone, tablet or laptop gets you through the day. All too often, you have a dead gadget when you can least afford it. That is why a booming market in portable battery packs has arisen, and a company called Anker is one of the leaders (it just got written up by tech site The Verge). Anker’s rapidly expanding line of battery packs has something for every budget and situation. Its $66 PowerCore 20100 has two USB ports for charging smartphones and tablets, along with a Micro-USB port for charging the battery pack itself via a home wall outlet. Other options include the $66 PowerCore+ 20100 USB-C model that comes in handy if you have recent-model laptops and smartphones with newfangled USB-C ports. I’ve used both of these packs and love ’em. HARDWARE PROTECTORS There’s also a booming market in cases and sleeves for digital devices, which are just one finger slip away from taking a tumble onto the hard floor and becoming damaged. Two companies, Minneapolis-based Pad & Quill and San Francisco-based WaterField Designs, provide some of the finest device protectors around. Pad & Quill is known for cases that encase devices — from iPhones to MacBooks — in lightweight wood frames that are then wrapped with leather covers. Some of the company’s products eschew the wood for trimmer designs. WaterField tends to take a different tack with soft, padded sleeves and cases that take a pounding with no damage to your devices. Attractive, durable materials used to make these protectors include waxed canvas and ballistic nylon. Related Articles It’s important to protect your computer and the data on it. Just do it.

Digital Trends Home > Mobile > Tips for buying a used smartphone Tips for buying a used smartphone By Simon Hill — Updated May 26, 2017 11:43 am Subscribe Share Jessica Lee Star/Digital Trends Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: The best smartphones pack tempting features into stylish bodies, but they don’t come cheap. You can easily spend upwards of $600 on a new smartphone — the Samsung Galaxy S8 starts at $750, for instance — but you don’t have to clean out your bank account to nab a snazzy smartphone. Buying a used device is a tried-and-true method of saving cash on a purchase. In this guide, we’re going to lay out your options and run through some tips for buying a used smartphone, helping ensure you don’t get ripped off. Not all second-hand smartphones are created equal, so let’s break this down by category. Buying refurbished smartphones The best kind of used smartphone to go for is a refurbished phone. These are phones that were returned to the manufacturer for one reason or another. They are fully tested, factory reset, and certified. They also usually come with some kind of warranty. When you buy a refurbished phone, it should be close to the experience of buying a new phone. If you buy a refurbished iPhone from Apple, for example, it will have a new battery, a pristine outer shell, and a box with all the necessary accessories. It will also come with a one-year warranty, but that won’t be the case if you buy elsewhere. Standards vary, so always check the details carefully. Whenever possible, buy directly from manufacturers, as they have the greatest incentive to ensure the refurbished phones they sell are problem-free. Before you get too excited about refurbished smartphones, however, it’s worth noting that they’re the most expensive kind of used smartphone around. You can often reap significant savings with little risk, but real bargain hunters will be unimpressed. If you want to shop for refurbished phones, then check out these stores: Amazon Apple Best Buy Samsung Walmart Buying certified pre-owned smartphones One step down from refurbished phones, you’ll find the certified pre-owned category. Once again, these phones have undergone some kind of testing, been factory reset, and should come with a limited warranty. They’ll be a bit cheaper than refurbished phones, too, though they probably won’t be in as good condition. Certified pre-owned phones have been tested to make sure that they work properly, but they’re not like-new — these are used smartphones and may have cosmetic damage or internal wear and tear. They also won’t necessarily be re-boxed or presented as new phones, and could be missing some accessories. Always check the details before you buy, because there may be differences when it comes to the definition of certified pre-owned from retailer to retailer. There will also be differences in the warranty they offer.. If you want to shop for certified pre-owned phones, then check out these stores: Amazon AT&T Best Buy Target Verizon Buying used smartphones The biggest bargains are to be found in the used smartphone category, but there are also greater risks in buying a used smartphone. You might be able to secure last year’s flagship with extra accessories at a knock-down price, but you could also end up with a dud and no way to get a refund. You need to check the seller’s description carefully, only consider listings with photos, and ask questions before you buy. Try to deal with sellers who have positive ratings, if possible. Some services offer listing verification and payment protection in the event something goes wrong, while others don’t. You should look for a return policy and use a service like PayPal, so you have some possibility of getting a refund if your new phone turns out to be damaged or stolen. If you’re going to meet in-person to buy a phone, always take someone with you and choose a well-lit public place to meet. Make it clear to the seller that you want to test the phone before you buy, and that you’ll be bringing a SIM card to do just that. This will discourage scammers. Some of the best places to buy used smartphones are: eBay Craigslist Glyde Swappa The price is right You should do some research to get an idea of how much you need to spend. Swappa is particularly helpful for this, because it shows a chart of the average selling prices for each smartphone over time. You can also search the “sold listings” on eBay, if you want to see what the going rate for your desired phone is. Remember that prices for older smartphone models — like the iPhone 5, or Samsung Galaxy S6 — will always fall when a new one is released, as people tend to sell their older devices in order to raise cash for a new one. When you settle on a target price, be patient. If you’re trying to get a better-than-average bargain, then you need avoid being drawn into a bidding war. There’s a ton of variance on sites like eBay, so it can be smart to wait to bid on items until the last moment. Choose listings that end mid-week, because they won’t attract as many buyers as listings that end on Saturday or Sunday. Important things to consider There are several things you need to keep in mind when buying a used smartphone, so here’s a checklist to run through. If any of these things aren’t clear in the listing, then you need to ask the seller before you buy. Is the phone on your network or unlocked? Smartphones that are locked to a carrier tend to be a bit cheaper, so if you’re happy on Verizon, for example, go for a device that’s locked to Verizon. Unlocked smartphones, on the other hand, can be used on any network. Does the phone come with any accessories? Find out if it comes in the original box, with the charger and cable that it shipped with. You need to know if there any extras being thrown in, such as cases or headphones. The original box is a good sign that the phone is not stolen and a case suggests the previous owner has been taking care of the device. Has it been factory reset? You want a phone that has been wiped clean. Make sure the previous owner has removed all personal accounts and watch out for Factory Reset Protection (FRP). It’s a safety feature that Google recently added to Android to discourage would-be thieves. If FRP is not disabled before the phone is sold, then, even after a factory reset, you’ll be prompted to enter the username and password for the last Google account that was registered with the device before you can use it. Is there any physical damage? Ideally, you’ll be able to review a good mix of photos before you buy, but it’s worth checking whether there’s any damage that isn’t obvious from the supplied photos. You may also want to ask about water damage before you make your purchase. Test your phone When your new phone arrives, make sure you test it immediately and thoroughly. Put your SIM in and make sure it works, insert your MicroSD card (if it accommodates one), try charging the phone, and test the headphone port. You should also watch out for battery problems, especially with older phones. After all, batteries deteriorate over time and may eventually struggle to hold a charge. You may also want to try a diagnostic app or use service codes. You can find them for most phones with a quick online search, and they’ll allow you to test the battery, screen, and a few other bits and pieces. If you’re going to find a problem, it’s better to isolate it sooner rather than later. If you have a warranty, then you can quickly make a claim. If not, you can try to return your phone or claim a refund via PayPal. If you’re meeting in person and paying cash, then go to the meeting equipped with a SIM card, cable, laptop, and headphones and perform the tests before making your purchase.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars AI Tech giants acquired 34 AI startups in Q1 2017 Reuters May 28, 2017 9:33 AM Above: Sundar Pichai, chief executive officer of Google, onstage at Google I/O 2017. (Reuters) – A total of 34 artificial intelligence startups were acquired in the first quarter of this year, more than twice the amount of activity in the year-ago quarter, according to the research firm CB Insights. Tech giants seeking to reinforce their leads in artificial intelligence or make up for lost ground have been the most aggressive buyers. Google has acquired 11 AI startups since 2012, the most of any firm, followed by Apple, Facebook and Intel, respectively, according to CB Insights. The companies declined to comment on their acquisition strategies. A spokesman for Apple did confirm the company’s recent purchase of Lattice Data, a startup that specializes in working with unstructured data. The first quarter also saw one of the largest deals to date as Ford Motor Company invested $1 billion in Argo AI, founded by former executives on self-driving teams at Google and Uber. Startups are looking to go deep on applications of artificial intelligence to specific fields, such as health and retail, industry observers say, rather than compete directly with established companies. “What you will see is very big players will build platform services, and startup communities will migrate more to applied intelligent apps,” said Matt McIlwain, managing director of Madrona Venture Group. Healthcare startup Forward, for example, is using artificial intelligence to crunch data that can inform doctors’ recommendations. “For people who really want to focus on core AI problems, it makes a lot of sense to be in bigger companies,” said Forward Chief Executive Officer Adrian Aoun, who previously worked at Google. “But for folks who really want to prove a new field, a new area, it makes more sense to be separate.” Artificial intelligence companies that do remain independent field a steady stream of suitors: Matthew Zeiler, chief executive of Clarifai, which specializes in image and video recognition, said he has been approached about a dozen times by prospective acquirers since starting the company in late 2013. Clarifai’s pitch to customers such as consumer goods company Unilever and hotel search firm Trivago is bolstered by its narrow focus on artificial intelligence. “(Google) literally competes with almost every company on the planet,” Zeiler said. “Are you going to trust them with being your partner for AI?” Tech giants have been locked in a bidding war for academics specializing in artificial intelligence. Startups rarely have the capital to compete, but a company with a specialized mission can win over recruits, said Vic Gundotra, chief executive of AliveCor, which makes an AI-driven portable heart monitor. “They say, ‘I want to come here and work on a project that might save my mother’s life,’” Gundotra said.

But in her next breath, she proved she either isn't telling the truth or doesn't know what she's talking about. "We are making good progress with the companies who have put in place end-to-end encryption, some of them are being more constructive that others but we will continue to build on that," she told the BBC's Andrew Marr. She indicated frustration that messaging firms won't let the government "break" such encrypted messages for anti-terror investigations - among other things. Here's why that makes less than no sense. OK, so what is end-to-end encryption, anyway? Video Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8Cancel Play now End-to-end encryption means messages can only be decoded by the sender or receiver. They use a publicly available algorithm to scramble and unscramble the message on the phone itself, rather than the encryption being done by the service provider. The upshot of this is that Apple, WhatsApp, Telegram and other services that use the technology could not decrypt messages sent through their services if they wanted to. Read More Tory Amber Rudd attacked WhatsApp's encryption and people are all mad about it So when Amber Rudd says she doesn't want to ban it... (Photo: BBC) She's either not telling the truth, or she doesn't know what end-to-end encryption means. There's literally no way to offer a 'back door' to messages encrypted in this way. By its very nature, it is impossible. Would it be so bad if we didn't have end-to-end encryption? (Photo: REUTERS) Well, it depends on whether you like having your bank account hacked. Allowing a back door into end-to-end encryption wouldn’t just make it less secure for terrorists - it’d make loads of things you do online every day more vulnerable to attacks from hackers. This kind of security is not only used by messaging services. It’s used, entirely legitimately, by banks, card companies and healthcare providers to protect users from hackers.

Huawei's position in smartphones and tablets has dramatically risen over the last two years.   On her blog site, Brody notes today that "As Chief Design Executive, and now as Founder and Design Entrepreneur — I am charged with leveraging best UX practices in product design and branding strategy from a holistic perspective. I am delivering industry-defining products in cooperation with executive teams — usually the CEO, CMO and CTO. At Huawei, I was leading a world-class, global design team of 100+ employees with offices based in Shanghai, Shenzhen, Beijing, San Francisco, London and Munich. Very recently, I quit Huawei to focus on my own venture, Abalone.   I am a recognized expert, innovator and contributor in product and UX with numerous granted or filed technology patents encompassing user interface design, gesture interaction and UI implementation strategies for system designs for any platform. I am passionate about humanizing technology by crafting elegant, easy-to-use applications that delight and make a difference in people's lives.   My experience with, and insight into organizational development, design culture, process, strategy and execution is the direct result of having shipped numerous award-winning releases: I spent the majority of my work-life at Apple during its most defining decade (2001-2011) when Steve Jobs was most active and still alive.   I helped to establish the UX discipline within Apple's applications department. I created signature look & feel for: Apple's "ProKit" (Apple's design language for Photo, Video, Word processing and other productivity apps); iOS (for the launch of the iPhone in 2007); iCloud.   By working 1:1 with executives, engineers, stakeholders, and investors, as well as cross-functional software design and development teams, I make sure that products and services — for cloud computing, ecosystems and the internet of things (IoT), AI, AR and VR, self-driving cars — software and hardware, the sky is the limit — exhibit simplicity, consistency, stylistic breadth, attention to detail, balanced beauty, innovation, usability, and deep visceral satisfaction."   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

By Douglas A. McIntyre May 28, 2017 6:38 am EDT Print Email Tweet Source: courtesy of Apple Inc.Expectations for the sales of the iPhone 8 are extraordinarily high. There remain a number of questions among tech experts and Wall St. analysts who follow the company. Among them is whether the iPhone 8 launches in September or later. Even with a delayed release, the forecast for fourth quarter sales is, in some cases, close to 100 million. The iPhone 8 sales expectations depend largely on two things. The first is that the iPhone 7 is close to its one year birthday. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) customers anticipate these anniversaries as the time when they can buy an upgrade. iPhone releases have been a year apart in the past. The second expectations is that the iPhone 8 may be a larger leap in technology and features than any model since the iPhone 5. The iPhone 5 was lighter than earlier versions. It was much thinner. It had an upgraded camera. It was the first model design by Apple’s management after the death of Steven Jobs. There is always tremendous speculation about new iPhone features which begin months before release. For the iPhone 8, this might include a wireless charger. It may have an curved AMOLED display which allows for more picture sharpness and better contrast. It’s “home button” may be gone. The speaker and camera may be behind the display screen. It may come in new sizes. It is impossible to predict which if any of these will wildly excite potential buyers. Apple’s share price is near an all time high and its market cap at a record $800 billion. It cannot hold those numbers if the iPhone 8 is not a home run, both in the third calendar quarter when it will be released and more important the holiday quarter after. Cowen & Co.’s Timothy Arcuri was quoted by Barron’s as saying that what is most important to investors is not when the iPhone 8 is released as much as whether Apple can sell 90 million iPhones in the last quarter of the year. Apple is the best performing Dow stock this year, and to hold that position of the balance of 2017, the iPhone 8 needs to eclipse expectations. For the last quarter of the year, the number needs to be 100 million. I'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter terms and conditions   By Douglas A.

The official release is presumed to be early June. The flagship devices already went on sale in South Korea, China and the United States. Samsung, however, may face hurdles in promoting the Galaxy S8 in Japan as the Japanese smartphone market is dominated by Apple Inc. In the first quarter of the year, Samsung sold some 300,000 smartphones in Japan to account for 3.8 percent of the market share. In 2012, Samsung's presence was 14.8 percent, but it lost ground since then in the face of growing competition with Apple, whose market share topped 50 percent. The Galaxy S8 smartphones feature high resolution displays that bend on both sides and come with various innovative technologies, such as iris and face recognition scanners, and a smart voice assistance program named Bixby.

The video is part of an energy conservation campaign where Tokyo residents can exchange two or more incandescent light bulbs for one LED light bulb at local electronics stores, reports Arama Japan. The campaign will last until July 10.

This includes facial and speech recognition. Apple feels pressured to regain the advantage it once had in this space when it surprised everyone with the inclusion of personal assistant Siri. That took place on October 4th, 2011 with the release of the Apple iPhone 4s.. Since then, not only have companies like Google, Amazon and Microsoft caught up with Apple’s technology, many are well ahead. Apple currently uses both the central processing unit and the graphics processing unit in its devices to handle processes that use AI. Apple could increase processing speed and preserve battery life by having a dedicated chip handle any AI tasks. Chipmaker Qualcomm already has an AI module built in to the Snapdragon 835 chipset, which is currently running high-end Android devices like the Samsung Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+. The chip will also be found inside the recently introduced HTC U11. According to the source, Apple plans on offering third-party developers access to the chip, which will allow them to include AI features on their apps. Former Apple analyst Gene Munster points out the reasons why Apple is working on this chip. “Two of the areas that Apple is betting its future on require AI,” said Munster. “At the core of augmented reality and self-driving cars is artificial intelligence.” We could hear more from Apple about this AI chip during WWDC, which starts next month. Apple will also introduce iOS 11 at the annual conference, which will take place June 5th through June 9th. source: Bloomberg Posted on May 27, 2017Author wiredgorilla Post navigation Previous Previous post: Final ruling from arbitration panel awards BlackBerry $940 million from Qualcomm Next Next post: Unannounced Samsung Galaxy J7 (2017) and Galaxy J5 (2017) star in hands-on videos Web Hosting by Fastdot

Korea in last 5 paras) SEOUL, May 28 (Yonhap) -- Samsung Electronics Co. said Sunday it will release its flagship Galaxy S8 smartphones in Japan next month in hopes that they will help revitalize its brand reputation tainted by the ill-fated Galaxy Note 7 and expand its presence in one of Asia's largest markets currently dominated by Apple Inc. The South Korean tech giant will hold a series of promotion events in Japan for the Galaxy S8 and the Galaxy S8 Plus. The official release is presumed to be early June. The flagship devices already went on sale in South Korea, China and the United States. Samsung, however, may face hurdles in promoting the Galaxy S8 in Japan as the Japanese smartphone market is dominated by Apple Inc. In the first quarter of the year, Samsung sold some 300,000 smartphones in Japan to account for 3.8 percent of the market share. In 2012, Samsung's presence was 14.8 percent, but it lost ground since then in the face of growing competition with Apple, whose market share topped 50 percent. The Galaxy S8 smartphones feature high resolution displays that bend on both sides and come with various innovative technologies, such as iris and face recognition scanners, and a smart voice assistance program named Bixby. More than 1 million customers were using the high-end devices as of Saturday, 37 days after their release here, faster than the 74 days taken for their predecessor, the Galaxy S7, to reach the mark. Samsung Electronics said late last month that global sales of the Galaxy S8 smartphones reached 5 million units in less than a month after their official release. Samsung released the Galaxy S8 and the Galaxy S8 Plus in South Korea, the United States and Canada on April 21, with the flagship smartphones set to reach some 120 countries gradually, including China and Japan. Industry watchers said Samsung is expected to sell 20 million units of the Galaxy S8 series by the end of the second quarter. Annual sales are estimated to be between 50 million and 60 million units. sam@yna.co.kr (END) Most Viewed Seoul to ban smoking at cultural asset sites (4th LD) Park apologizes over alleged sexual misconduct by ex-spokesman Ssangyong says resumption of overnight shift turning point of normalization (2nd LD) N.

Steve Jobs and Kathak danseuse Sangita Chatterjee, besides four little words that fundamentally welds them together—‘Stay hungry stay foolish’. Sangita Chatterjee Jobs once said this during his address at Stanford University. Chatterjee held on to the words ever since. Performing now at the UMAK Festival 2017, they seem to be ringing louder than ever. “The hunger to get better refuses to be satiated. That’s the reason I keep at it even after all these years,” she says. To honour the 82nd birthday of sitarist Pandit Debu Chaudhuri, a two-day festival that commenced on May 27 has been put together. “I’ll start my dance with a Shiv Stotram, which elucidates the omnipresence of Shiva and Shakti, which are synonymous with faith and devotion. Gradually, the pieces elaborate the different faces of the lord,” she says. The first day of the festival saw a showcase of Kuchipudi dance by the celebrated Radha and Raja Reddy, followed by a sitar recital by Pandit Prateek Chaudhuri. To be staged next were thumris and dadras by vocalist Malini Awasthi. On May 28, beats of the tabla and percussions were helmed by Pranshu Chaturlal. This was followed by a Bharatnatyam performance by Sneha Chakradhar. The evening will also see a Dhrupad recital by vocalist Ustad Wasifuddin Dagar, and then a sitar performance by Pandit Debu Chaudhuri. The finalé is a Kathak recital by Vidushi Nalini Kamalini. She concludes with an expressional piece, which portrays  the pain of the  virohatkanthitanayika (heroine), who awaits the arrival of her beloved. With that, the programme bids a lyrical goodbye.   Good to know: May 28, 2 pm onwards, at Azad Bhawan auditorium of the Indian Council for Cultural Relations, near ITO.  O P E N Professional Courses Sponsored link Technology Courses Sponsored link Gallery Brazilians hit the streets to protest against gang gun battles and police My world is my Bond - A look at James Bond 007 Roger Moore's acting life arrow Videos US launches first South China Sea patrol under Trump Manchester United fans celebrate Europa League win arrow FOLLOW US Copyrights New Indian Express.2017 Dinamani | Kannada Prabha | Samakalika Malayalam | Malayalam Vaarika | Indulgexpress | Edex Live Contact Us | About Us | Careers | Privacy Policy | Search | Terms of Use | Advertise With Us Home | Nation | World | Cities | Business | Columns | Entertainment | Sport | Magazine | The Sunday Standard

Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus: Simply stunning! Last updated on: May 28, 2017 08:00 IST There is definitely a case for the S8 plus to be crowned as the champion of the handsets for the year 2017 With the Galaxy S7 handsets, Samsung showed quite impressively what it was capable of. The S7 Edge in particular established Samsung's refined ways of crafting unique phones, and few would have believed that anything could be capable of making the handsets outdated within a span of months. While every year brings the renewed challenge for the handset makers to out perform themselves, the Galaxy Note 7's problems raised the stakes for Samsung further. To everybody's delight, the Galaxy S8 handsets, and again the Plus variant in particular, resoundingly proved that Samsung is not the types to throw in the towel. The 2017 flagship handsets are not only sleeker, taller, and more premium, it carries the hope of redefining the mobile phone market, with the Galaxy S8 leading from the front. While pristine looks combined with top of the line hardware comes at a pretty price, one needs to look realistically about the chances it carries in a fiercely competing industry. There is no shortage of capable handsets with friendlier price tags, and the trend is not going anywhere either. How much really does the all premium Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus hold against its rivals? We try to fish out the answer. Construction While the display is one of the important pillars of a smart phone, there is very little scope for making changes in this department. Samsung seems to have cracked the mystery regarding how the future of phone display will be. A cursory glance at this glass and metal device, and it reinforces the belief that it is indeed futuristic. The handset measures 159.5 x 73.4 x 8.1 mm in all, and weighs a decent 173 gms. This IP68 certified device is a tall phone, and Samsung has done well to keep it slimmer. This should allow a decent leeway while moving the thumb across to access all those app icons. The glass back is curved and further assists in holding the phone comfortably. It is quite remarkable that the Galaxy S8 Plus is right about iPhone 7's size, and yet, it comfortably beats the Apple device's 5.5-inch display in every which way possible. One of the big surprises was that Samsung finally has removed the home button, a permanent fixture on its flagship mobile phones. Instead, Samsung has opted for the onscreen navigation buttons, two of which can be switched as per the user preference. The home button can be accessed from anywhere on the bottom part of the display, and features haptic feedback. The virtual buttons add to the immersive experience of the 'Infinity Display', as Samsung prefers to call it. Turn the phone around and one finds the camera module, the heart rate sensor, and the LED flash. Sitting right next to the camera is the finger print scanner and quite honestly is one of biggest flaws in this design. One has to be mighty dexterous in order to reach it without smudging the camera lens. Samsung clearly had to resort to this placement after it ran out of time to embed the fingerprint scanner underneath the display screen. As for the button placement, the power button has been placed on the right edge, where as the left edge is seen carrying the volume buttons. The top edge has the hybrid dual SIM slot, while at the bottom edge one finds the 3.5 mm audio jack, the USB Type C port, and the single speaker. The left edge also has a new addition to Samsung handsets, a button to launch Bixby -- Samsung's very own voice assistant. Overall, it is a stunning piece of premium hardware, and Samsung has indeed outdone itself with this 2017 blockbuster product. Display True to its image, Samsung again has wowed everybody with their choice and styling of display for the latest flagship handset. The Galaxy S8 Plus boasts of a big, but tall 6.2-inch Super AMOLED display panel. With a resolution of 1440 x 2960 p, the pixel density goes right upto a mind boggling 529 ppi. Samsung has been courageous enough to bring forward both the Galaxy S8 handsets with curved displays. The displays are less steep, and this revised design gives it a very sublime look and feel. Just the way the screen meets the metal, removing scope of any bezel to exist, makes it look like the next logical upgrade in the display department. Another interesting thing to note on the S8 Plus is the 18.5:9 aspect ratio. The tall display has got the interest of the heavy users of media files piqued. The 'Mobile HDR Premium' certification needs to be seen to believed. The screen gets flooded with the content all over, giving a fantastic immersive experience. The effort from Google to bring the apps to match this aspect ratio bodes well for the S8 handsets' chances. While few aspects of videos like subtitles may get cropped out, one cannot deny the fantastic experience while watching the videos. Always on display has been provided, but it could have been a bit more detailed. Little more details on the notifications would have enhanced the effectiveness here. Otherwise, the display has nothing to complain about. Bright enough to be used outdoors without any issues, and Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protection gives some assurance. But the display remains fragile, especially the corners. Users will do well to opt for a sturdy case for this beauty. Specifications Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus comes with the Exynos 8895 SoC. The octa core CPU comprises of four cores operating at 2.3 GHz, while another set of four cores are clocked at 1.7 GHz. The GPU responsibilities are handled by Mali-G71 MP20, and we see 4GB worth of RAM supplied alongside. There is a rich dose of 64 GB worth of onboard storage that comes with the S8 plus, which can be further increased by another 256 GB via microSD card slot. Connectivity The S8 Plus is a dual SIM handset, and comes complete with support for 4G as well as VoLTE technology. Some users may frown at the hybrid slot, which will force them to choose from either the secondary SIM, or the microSD card. Samsung should have spared the users from making this harsh choice. Other connectivity options include WiFi (802.11ac), GPS, NFC and Bluetooth 5.0. The latter allowing not only for faster transfers and longer range, but also the advantage of pairing two Bluetooth speakers to get a good surround sound effect going for their media files esp. Radio feature sadly failed to make the cut. Operating system Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus comes running the Android Nougat (ver 7.0), with a custom skin applied on top. Samsung prefers to call it 'Samsung Experience' now. The software aspect of Samsung handsets has been the consistent recipient of criticism, and it is good to see Samsung finally warming up to the issue. The user interface looks cleaner, refreshed, and well laid out. Users can swipe from anywhere on the screen to bring the app drawer up. They could have optimised this a bit more, but let us not nitpick. They also seem to have addressed the issue of 'Ghost Taps' experienced by the users on the edge variants. Speaking of the edge, users can swipe to get access to their preferred apps, contacts, screenshots or the gif making abilities. The rolling screenshot is a favourite feature, allowing to grab an entire page. Icons look much evolved, and the system apps too have been refreshed in looks. One can long press the app icons to get some additional options. While still not Apple-esque 3D touch, it is a start. The default keyboard may not be appreciated by everybody, and installing a third party keyboard maybe in order. Then there are the issues of the pre-installed software like Microsoft Suite and Samsung's own duplicate apps like browser, the health based apps etc. Not only do they clutter things, most of these are not completely uninstallable either. Maybe next year Samsung will oblige by removing these? Lastly, we come to Samsung's own virtual assistant Bixby. While it has a few tricks up its sleeves like bringing up weather info, system based options, themes and wallpaper options etc, it is also problematic. There is a slight lag while loading it, and it still doesn't do voice commands. Samsung deserves every bit of flak for the Bixby inclusion. Not only is it a half cooked product, it is basically a clone of Android's virtual assistant. The stubbornness of Samsung to not allow the users to remap the Bixby button is counter productive. The only somewhat useful feature of Bixby is enabling the users to look up desired products by clicking their photographs and launching a Bixby based search. How much and how frequently this will be used, is anybody's guess. Camera At the rear, Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus has a 12 MP sensor camera (with Dual Pixels), it has a f/1.7 aperture, and comes complete with Optical Image Stabilisation and Phase Detection Autofocus. While at the first glance one may think that Samsung has not tinkered with last year's S7's camera here, but that is not entirely true. Samsung has indeed gone for a more polished version than last year. To counter the all conquering Google Pixel's camerawork, Samsung has upgraded the last year's camera sensor and the result clearly shows. The Samsung Galaxy S8 handsets now rival Google Pixel in photography department, and these three marquee handsets tower above the competition easily. The images captured by S8 Plus come out looking vibrant. Punchier colours and more vividness give the images an impressive, brighter look and feel. The Auto HDR has been kept on by default and it has got a great deal of contribution in the final results. Seldom will the user feel to tinker around with the auto mode. Pro mode of course is there for the prosumers. The f/1.7 aperture also means better night time photography, and Samsung stands tall in this realm especially. The noise has been suppressed impressively and details come out nicely. The PDAF ensured that the camera locked onto subjects quickly in any condition. Samsung's camera app also has been quite impressive, and using the onscreen shutter button for zooming in and out is a useful feature. Users can swipe anywhere on the screen to switch between the cameras easily. Addition of Snapchat like filters ought to win more admirers, as the filters are not only good looking, the tracking function seems to be on the money as well. The videos mirror the findings from the still photography department, with clips looking brighter and more crisp than from last year's flagships. Even the OIS looks more robust. One can shoot really good looking 4K videos, but the 1080p videos however have the HDR magical feature enabled, and that made the latter resolution an automatic choice. The front facing camera gets a huge bump, with last year's 5 MP camera getting replaced by an 8 MP variant. There is the auto focus mode as well, and everything combined nicely to get sharper selfie shots. Performance This here is one of the most potent configuration here on paper, and the tasks zipped across the screen as expected. Be it the multitasking or the multi window feature being pressed into service, there were no hiccups really. The HD content looked superb on the gorgeous screen and be it the demanding games or the video content, everything fared smoothly. The Samsung Experience UI still has some rough edges it seems. It was a crying shame to see Bixby launching with a little pause, a problem veteran Samsung users have seen with other apps in the past. The very slight stutter with the scrolling will remind you about that little bit of non optimization being left out. Samsung ought to own up and remove these with the next update. While the AKG branded headset brings out good quality sound, the speaker just about does the job. Yes, it is loud, but not really sublime. A stereo speaker would have added to the sheen on this hardware, but that was not to be. The placement makes it easy for the landscape mode lovers to muffle the speaker every now and then. The fingerprint scanner is quick and accurate, but the placement again frustrates a lot. Thankfully, the iris scanner, which should not be called as secure, comes to the rescue. It is fast and does the job even with sun glasses on, but make sure that your photograph is not widely available as that can be used to unlock the handset as well. Battery The Galaxy S8 plus comes with a 3500 mAh non user replaceable battery. While it sounded a tad feeble for the task, thankfully, the handset lasted for a day comfortably on a moderate to heavy usage pattern. Adaptive charging feature has been preferred here, and allows for the battery to go from 0 to 100 per cent charged in about an hour and 45 minutes. Opt for the wireless charging ways, and expect about half an hour worth of increment in waiting time for battery to be fully juiced up. Users can opt for 1080p display instead of cranking it up all the way to conserve the energy. Opting for non HDR mode also gets significant boost for the battery performance. It is good to see Samsung putting in options to exercise during the crunch periods. Verdict The expectations were high, and with the S8+ and the S8, Samsung has redefined the competition, just like how they did it with the introduction of Samsung Galaxy Note. There should be no hesitation by the users of premium phablet users to switch over to the S8+, even if not due for an immediate upgrade of their phones. A stunning display, polished camera which was already had a reckoning, water resistance, microSD card slot, and wireless charging, all these features are enticing enough. There is definitely a case for the S8 plus to be crowned as the champion of the handsets for the year 2017. The battery does its job, and after Samsung published a detailed report about the findings on Note 7 fiasco, their decision not to pack the S8 handsets with extravagant battery packs must be appreciated. The S8 plus is retailing for Rs 64,900 and for the features and the futuristic theme, it looks like a price worth paying for.

HCA provides free services for 70 per cent of home hospice patients in Singapore. (Photo: HCA) By Chong Poh Heng 28 May 2017 09:03AM (Updated: 28 May 2017 05:09PM) Share this content Share on Facebook Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on LinkedIn Share via Whatsapp Share via Whatsapp Share via E-Mail Share via E-Mail SINGAPORE: Before the iconic Steve Jobs of Apple fame died of pancreatic cancer in 2011, he spoke poignantly of his terminal illness: “Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. There is no reason not to follow your heart.” This is the kind of inspirational philosophy that should resonate when we think about how to approach healthcare for those with terminal illness. As Singapore’s largest home hospice care provider, HCA provides free services to about 70 per cent of home hospice patients in Singapore. We operate both home hospice care and a day care service for patients who are well enough to move about independently and would enjoy social activities in a communal setting. Patients are accepted based on referrals from their primary care doctor and must meet specified criteria.  The home hospice care model allows terminally ill patients to stay at home and for the nurses and doctors to come to them instead. (Photo: AP) Advertisement Advertisement We see an average of about 800 patients with life-limiting illnesses at any one time, with about 3,500 admissions per year. Patients who are referred to us typically have a prognosis of 12 months or less. Our average length of service is about three months. While these statistics may seem bleak, the miracle of life always seem to defy the odds: While 2,000 of the admissions each year do pass on, there are about 700 patients who are discharged. Just imagine, one in five of our patients may be well enough to be discharged. They may go back to their own primary physicians for ongoing standard care and other regular home medical care services. Some even return to their own family GPs (general practitioners) just like before. Based on a report in the New England Journal of Medicine, research has demonstrated that a group of lung cancer patients under palliative care not only lived longer compared to those receiving standard care, they also had a better quality of life and enjoy better mental well-being. These patients also experienced significantly lower depressive symptoms than those in the standard care groups, according to the same report. Although many researchers are still trying to decipher what exactly contributed to this astonishing finding, it is actually not a surprise to practitioners like us who do encounter some amazing outcomes among our patients. Many come to us with an initial prognosis of a few months, but go on to live out their supposed terminal illness for many years. A RAY OF LIGHT IN THOSE LAST DARK DAYS There are key differences between home hospice care and institutional care where patients receive palliative care within a healthcare facility. Indeed, there are economic arguments for moving those with terminal illness to a separate facility where they can be collectively taken care of by dedicated and trained staff on hand, and looked after 24/7 to help them manage their symptoms and ensure their safety as they move about. For families with no one around to take care of these patients, this option may indeed be the best option. Although hard-won health and safety practices and rules may win over family members, however, patients in these facilities and their loved ones are subject to various regulations including restrictions on visiting hours and meal times. In all fairness, this is necessary to avoid disruptions to and ensure the smooth running of such healthcare facilities. There are key differences between home hospice care and institutional care where patients receive palliative care within a healthcare facility. (Photo: AP) But for many patients already having to deal with the idea that a terminal illness is cutting their lifespan short, is moving into a new environment, without the warm familiarity of “normal” family life, really a better alternative? We must ask ourselves, is a life of safety what most people want for themselves in those last stages? What do these restrictions mean for the patient’s sense of control and individuality, for people who are living their last days? Do they feel a sense of fear and despair when they are housed in the same place with others “in the same situation”? Are they not constantly reminded of the painful realities and the close to little chance they have of surviving their condition? In this regard, home hospice care, which provides daily door-to-door visits with meals and activities for patients, can be a ray of light in their lives. During each session, nurses render medical services including pain management and change of dressing, as well as non-clinical services including counseling family members to prepare them mentally for the eventuality of the patient’s passing. HCA provides home hospice care for free as we understand that living within an institution or some other medical facility may be expensive and often not necessary for the patient who will be better off living with his or her family. With a medical professional just a phone call away and pacing alongside at every step of their journey, patients have fuller assurance and confidence to face the path ahead. The assurance of having a hospice care professional available 24 hours a day, every day of the week, affirms hope as patients are encouraged to add life to their remaining days. (Photo: HCA) More importantly, they are enabled to life their lives out as “normally” and independently as possible, giving them personal dignity and individual freedom. To answer why patients who receive palliative care seem to lead better lives, perhaps not all things are found in quantifiable data – death is real, but so is hope. When one struggles with unrelieved pain from progressive disease, the will to live can only wane. However, this will to live and strive on can be re-ignited when hospice care staff facilitate important conversations about facing and even conquering fears. The positive impact of this open discussion on patients, caregivers and families can be great. The mindful, compassionate and patient-centred approach to care brings dignity to the process. This dignity often gets lost when one falls gravely ill and has to depend on others for simple, daily chores. It is ironic that dignity is what patients seek most as they face their final challenges in life. FINDING A MUTUAL FRIENDSHIP IN THE FINAL JOURNEY Nurses who travel to our patients’ doorsteps are not just healthcare staff; they become so sensitised to patients’ personal needs that they go the extra mile to address non-clinical issues: This includes cutting their hair, helping with household chores and even finding volunteers to photograph family portraits for patients and their loved ones. One nurse I know even went as far to arrange for a five-year-old boy to visit the zoo because he loved dinosaurs and wanted to see one such exhibition held there. Others also facilitate patients' request to leave behind a lasting legacy through special projects. Whether these are their personal expressions in artwork, or a cookbook of treasured family recipes, these projects have helped many patients and families find a more complete closure. In all these, I find that our people involved in home hospice care have suddenly become more than palliative care practitioners to our patients. They have become family friends. And this friendship is mutual because our patients in turn enrich our own lives. In the many earnest conversations we have had with patients, we were privileged to witness their finding meaning in suffering and demonstration of courage and grace despite the ravages of their debilitating illnesses. These courageous qualities that are brought to bear serves to underscore the critical spiritual care that resonates throughout our care approach. This elusive element of uplifting the spirit often defies objective, clinical measurements. Our care philosophy is to assist the terminally ill live well while at home and more than 50 per cent of our patients are able to pass on comfortably, surrounded by the care and love of their family members. While we all have to make the final journey ourselves, it is perhaps not the distance we should focus on, but the daily pace of the final lap.

White Share Share Tweet Comment Email Print advertisement For a company whose embrace of mobile work predates the internet and even the personal computer, IBM's decision to recall employees back to the office has human resources experts warning that the move could make it harder for Big Blue to compete with the likes of Google and Apple, along with hot startups, to recruit and retain the best people. "I think it is going to be a talent problem," said Jennifer Glass, the Barbara Bush professor of liberal arts at the Population Research Center at the University of Texas. "It's very clear in the literature that autonomy is something talented workers want, especially millennials." The back-to-the-office movement could work if management is clear about the benefits working in an office will provide. Shutterstock A survey by Flexjobs.com found that 80 percent of respondents said that flexibility was a top consideration when considering a new job, and a third reported leaving a job because it didn't offer the flexibility they needed. "People work from home for a lot of different reasons," Sara Sutton Fell, founder and CEO of Flexjobs.com, including accommodating childcare, eldercare and disabilities. "They need it. They don't just want it." Related: Researchers Say This Is the Key to Being Happy at Work Some experts say the rollback of telecommuting reflects a more seismic shift as IBM struggles to adapt to rapid changes in an industry it once dominated. "When technology companies change priorities or shift focus, there can be a change as well to how and where employees work," said Scott Dobroski, community expert at Glassdoor.com. "This is is a sign of something much bigger," said Dave Carvajal, CEO of Dave Partners, a technology-focused recruiting firm. "IBM is struggling to compete in the competitive tech marketplace that has become significantly more agile and nimble over the past decade." IBM's quarterly report last month had higher-than-expected earnings but missed analyst expectations on revenue — marking five years straight of year-over-year quarterly revenue declines. Company executives say making people work together will help reverse its fortunes. At a conference last fall, CFO Martin Schroeter talked to investors about "get[ting] the teams back together as opposed to so spread out," saying the relocation would make them "more agile." It Didn't Work for Yahoo But not everyone agrees that proximity can foster performance gains. "I'm personally a little skeptical," Sutton Fell said. "It didn't really help Yahoo." The news of IBM's reversal on telecommuting drew many comparisons to Yahoo. When CEO Marissa Mayer eliminated Yahoo's work-from-home perk in 2013, it provoked a backlash from those who said the shift placed an unfair burden on working parents — especially since the news was coupled with reports that Mayer had a nursery constructed adjacent to her office so she could bring her then-infant son to work with her. Given IBM's performance struggles, some observers suggested that the shift away from remote work could be a way to shed workers through attrition without resorting to layoffs. Related: Some Companies Encourage Employees to Disconnect During Vacation "IBM has been bringing teams like these together for several years, across many areas of the company: software development, digital marketing, Watson, design, and IBM's CIO teams, just to name a few," IBM spokeswoman Laurie Friedman said via email. She did not respond to a question about how many employees ultimately would be affected but said workers could reapply for other jobs — around 5,000 in the U.S. — with the company, and added that some workers would be able to continue working remotely. "I'm highly suspicious of this idea that if you corral everybody into the same room you're going to get magic," Glass said. "I think it's an attempt to exert more managerial control when business is down and they're under pressure to turn things around." Collaboration May Need to Be Relearned Some experts do see the potential for a positive outcome as IBM expands its work in areas like cloud computing and artificial intelligence. "We know it's an added focus on innovation," Dobroski said. "That's very enticing to today's tech talent." By making people come into the office, managers will be able to focus on more hands-on mentoring and training — benefits that attract ambitious millennials but are harder to execute with a far-flung workforce. "This is the generation that says, if I'm not learning, I'm gone," said Dayna Fellows, president of consulting company WorkLife Performance, Inc. The back-to-the-office movement could work if management is "really smart and clear" about the benefits working in an office will provide, she said. Related: Three-Day Weekends, Free Vacation Money? Taking Job Perks to the Max But to achieve this, experts say IBM will need to invest in restructuring its work environment and culture. "If they simply bring people in and expect them to work exactly the same way in a crowd situation, it will fail," Fellows said. "That would be the mistake, is if everything stays the same but people come in." "Collaboration is helped by being together, but it has to be on purpose. You have to create a culture... It doesn't just happen by bumping into each other," said Ellen Galinsky, senior research advisor at the Society for Human Resource Management. "If the problem is collaboration, that probably needs to be addressed directly. You can't just assume that if people are in the same space, they are going to collaborate and work together," she said. "Holistic change at that level requires real leadership," Carvajal said. Martha C.

QLED greatest selling point is how good it can show colours. The flatscreens are ultra thin and light. Journalists watching a presentation at the Samsung QLED launch at Central Hotel, Panama. Ricardo Gonzalez, audio and video director at Samsung. Given the sleek design of the device, Samsung encourages owners to use innovative design concepts when adding it to their living rooms. 1 2 3 4 5 6 In a technologically competitive market, Samsung has tried to keep ahead by constantly innovating. Apart from their release of the Galaxy S8 smartphone in the United States in the first quarter, the launch of their Quantum Dot LED (QLED) smart TVs is now the company's biggest project in the region. "The Caribbean and Latin American region has been extremely receptive to our premium devices, especially with the fact that people want to engage their TV differently and we are helping them to do so," stated Ricardo Gonzalez, audio and video director at Samsung.   It's all about screen   The launch also showcased Samsung biggest technological strength, which is the production of superior screens. In fact, Samsung has produced screen components for many of its competitors, most notably Apple. Therefore, the brand feels confident with its new TV, which will be available to consumers by next month. The main technology here is Samsung's use of a Quantom Dot layer, which is placed over a LED screen to produce greater colour volumes. The various models with the QLED technology are Samsung Q7F, Q8C, Q7C and Q9F. All are 55 inches, except the Q9F, which is 65 inches. The price range of the devices will be from US$2,600 to $6,000. For us in Jamaica, this means they will most likely cost upwards of $300,000. The launch, which introduces the product to the Caribbean and Latin America, was held in Panama where representatives throughout the region were invited to attend. Samsung boast that this TV will show superior images because of its ability to show extreme contrast in colours. This means that their TVs can show much darker and brighter colours than the previous models. In addition, there is also the option of a curved version, which will give viewers a more immersive viewing experience from any angle.   Preparing for the future   Practically speaking, the price index of most high-end televisions, which uses technology such as QLED, Plasma or OLED, will be beyond the reach of the average consumer for now. It's really a race for the future of technology, much similar to the product wars in the '80s between VHS and Betamax, which VHS won. Brands like Samsung and LG are competing to become the definitive standard-bearer for the next era of visual content consumption. Being a large manufacturer of cell phones and household appliances, Samsung's approach is simple. They want to conquer the consumer market in a comprehensive way, primarily through the integration of their products. In the immediate future, most of their devices will be able to communicate via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth and some are currently being showcased by the brand. Recently, the company demonstrated a glimpse of this with their Samsung Family Hub Refrigerator, which has a touch-screen display on the exterior, equipped with apps to assist the user. Such apps include Shopping List, which can also display photos of grocery items needed. Naturally, this is only the beginning. I'm sure the fridge will soon be able to display this information on Samsung's QLED TVs as well.   Interaction with your cell phone   Currently, their TV can interact seamlessly with Samsung smartphones that has the Smart View app. For example, once a user uses this app and syncs his Samsung TV and phone, his phone can be used as a remote controller for his TV. In addition, the TV can be used to mirror anything on his phone, therefore, if the user is viewing vacation pictures on his phone and wants everyone in the living room to see it, he can easily transmit the photos to the TV. "You can cast whatever you have on your phone to your TV. Also, we try to keep uniformity throughout our platforms, so if you are accustom to the layout of our smartphones, you will easily understand how to use our TVs," shared Gonzalez. Truth be told, many other brands can do this, but not in such an effortless manner. Samsung's main competitor and country mate LG has also launched its new organic light-emitting diode (OLED) TV which directly competes with Samsung's QLED. Both companies have two main objectives, which are to produce great picture quality while making their TVs as thin as possible. "We have been the number one TV manufacturer for 11 years now and the Caribbean has contributed to this accomplishment. We believe this region is always eager to experience new technology and that includes not only the picture quality, but the design and smart platform," Gonzalez concluded.

Its right arm is holding a screen, which playfully challenges visitors to compete with the robot in a manual task: tracing the word YASKAWA as quickly as possible. It’s a trick, of course: The robot always wins. On the multiple times I tried, I never beat the robot, and lost in both accuracy and speed by large margins. The robot could complete, in just a few seconds, a task that took me eight seconds at my fastest, and much more at my slowest (and most accurate). After it beats the visitor, the robot twirls the screen between its two arms, showing off yet another task that a human can’t do nearly as well. And then, a message pops up on the screen, in bright red: “YOU LOSE. ROBOTS WILL ALWAYS WIN ... ALWAYS!!” Popular Searches QBE Insurance Group Ltd QBEIF ▼ 9.53 -0.34 -3.44% Tencent Holdings Ltd TCTZF ▼ 35.60 -0.14 -0.39% Premier Investments Ltd PMV ▼ 12.25 -0.02 -0.16% Ten Network Holdings Ltd TWG ▲ 0.1260 +0.0220 +21.15% Though the message is tongue-in-cheek, its gist appears to be increasingly true. Robots and algorithms are proving themselves better than humans at a number of tasks, both physical and mental. A Google computer program, AlphaGo, is beating top masters around the world at Go, which is considered one of the world’s most difficult games. San Francisco-based Momentum Machines has unveiled a robot that can make 400 hamburgers in an hour, a much faster rate than humans can. Foxconn, the company that builds electronic devices for companies including Apple and Samsung, is reportedly replacing tens of thousands of factory workers with more-efficient robots. The news about these developments often has an air of panic about it, as economists worry about how humans will make a living if the machines are doing all the work. The numbers are certainly concerning: Evidence suggests that industrial robots like the ones made in the Yaskawa factory have cost thousands of American jobs. The number of industrial robots, which are automatically controlled, multipurpose, reprogrammable machines, increased fourfold between 1993 and 2007, according to a recent study by MIT economists Daron Acemoglu and Pascual Restrepo. The authors found that one such industrial robot in a metropolitan area reduced employment by about six workers, costing the U.S. economy 670,000 jobs between 1990 and 2007. But there are positives too. The MIT economist David Autor has emphasized that automation also complements labor, making workers more productive. There are certain tasks that robots can’t do, he writes, and humans will always be needed for those. Working along with robots, humans can also create new, better jobs. Indeed, another study, out of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, shows that between 2010 and 2015, six technology-related jobs were created for every 10 jobs lost. And despite the deployment of thousands of robots across the country, the unemployment rate is at a 10-year-low, and worries of widespread joblessness have yet to materialize. My visit to the Yaskawa factory illustrated these positives. I talked to a 25-year-old process engineer named Greg Smith, who has a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering and is finishing up his master’s in electrical engineering. He showed me an automated vehicle that communicated with a humanoid robot to move parts around a factory floor, as the robots checked the parts to make sure they were made correctly, and retooled those that were not. We walked by a Yaskawa robot that could stack objects on top of one another, and one that took items off an assembly line and packed them in a box. Another robot—one of Yaskawa’s most popular products—welds metal parts together faster and more accurately than humans can. All of those robots are going to replace humans who do the same work, but on the other hand, Smith has a job because of the success of companies like Yaskawa. Increasingly, he told me, he is designing robots that work with humans collaboratively. Smith’s grandmother doesn’t like that he works with robots—she thinks he’s putting people out of work—but his career, at least, is secure. “My job will never go away,” he told me. © Provided by Atlantic Media Company Yaskawa robots picks boxes off an assembly line Smith said his approach to automation is a simple one: If American companies don’t automate, they won’t be able to compete with foreign companies that do. Besides, he said, robots conduct work that humans probably don’t want to do, work that is dirty, dangerous, and dull. Still, it can be awkward, senior process engineer Jack Moore told me, to visit a company whose CEO is talking about replacing people with machines. The CEO will show Moore a line of men welding, and say he wants to replace at least one of them with the product Moore is trying to sell. Load Error What’s the difference between workers like Smith and Moore, and the people who might be automated out of a job? The answer is simple: education. Workers with advanced degrees are going to be designing and making the robots—what Elon Musk refers to as the process of making the machines that make the machines.“The people empowered to educate themselves,” Moore said, “are still going to be here.” That’s not to say that the job of every person with a college education is going to be safe. In a 2013 Oxford study that predicted the jobs that would be most susceptible to automation, Carl Frey and Michael Osborne put insurance underwriters and tax preparers at the top of the list. But jobs that require creativity and critical thinking—jobs like the ones Smith and Moore have—should be secure. The jobs least likely to be automated on Frey and Osborne’s list included surgeons, curators, and mechanical engineers. Ensuring that the American workforce is adept at versatile thinking and has a job that allows them to employ the skill is an intimidating endeavor, one that goes far beyond workforce training. It’s about improving K-12 education and helping more people get on a path to college or some sort of advanced degree. According to a recent study out of the Institute for Spatial Analysis at the University of Redlands, workers without a high-school degree face an almost six times higher risk of their jobs being automated than those with a doctorate. Minorities could be especially hard hit by the coming wave of automation because of their education patterns: Hispanics are 25 percent more likely than whites to lose their jobs to automation, while African Americans are 13 percent more likely. Places like Yaskawa are leading the American workforce into a new future, where certain jobs that were once done by humans are going to be done by machines. That seems like a scary proposition, but it doesn’t have to be. Automation can also creates job, and good ones, for the people whose jobs machines can’t replace. The question will be how to make sure more Americans are in that lucky group. Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

Admittedly, that is Samsung's home market, so you'd expect its compatriots to return to the brand more readily than elsewhere after last year's battery disaster. But a doubling of the sales pace is quite a feat. It adds to the growing news flow suggesting Samsung is recovering well, with consumers lured by its cool bezel-less design and whizzbang features. But I'd posit an alternative reason: habit. Related Content Samsung Galaxy S8: The good and the bad While there are dozens of smartphone makers globally, only Samsung has the geographical reach to make it the default Android option almost everywhere. Much has been said about the rise of Chinese brands such as Huawei, Oppo and Vivo. Yet those three combined don't equal the shipment volumes of Samsung. More significantly, each of them barely exists outside their home market. Advertisement Even Huawei, a global brand in its own right, sells 61 per cent of its devices within China, according to data from Bloomberg Intelligence and IDC. For all manner of political and nationalistic reasons, Chinese prefer not to buy Samsung phones. Many other countries also have local heroes that patriots turn to. But that hasn't stopped the world, in general, from choosing Samsung. Latin America consistently gives it a 30 per cent share while Asia ex-Japan remains loyal quarter after quarter. It's still No. 1 in central and eastern Europe, despite a strong advance from Huawei, and in western Europe, Samsung is second behind only Apple.

Adam Turner May 29, 2017, 12:30pm ⋅ Filed to:  amazon alexa Australian Stories automation feature google home siri smart homes smh Share Image: Supplied With Belkin's WeMo gadgets finally set to take orders from Apple's Siri, the smart home giants are vying for the coveted position of household butler – acting as liaison between the lord of the manor and your digital servants. Apple's Answer To The Amazon Echo Sounds Creepy According to a new report from Bloomberg, Apple is moving forward with plans for a smart home hub, joining the Amazon Echo and the upcoming Google Home device in the battle to take over your house. Read more A smart home is supposed to make life easier but things soon become complicated when you're trying to juggle a dozen different smart gadgets using a dozen different smartphone apps. It's worse if you don't live alone and your loved ones are also trying to navigate your smart jungle, especially youngsters who might not have a smartphone in their pocket. Initially it looked like the easiest solution was to swear your allegiance to a single smart home ecosystem, ensuring all your tech played nicely together, although this can limit your options and become expensive compared to taking a best of breed approach. Can Google Home Really Kill The Amazon Echo? As soon as Google announced its new Home device last autumn, everyone (including this blog) was quick to call it an Amazon Echo Killer. But since then, the Echo has gained some new powers. So how do the two gadgets stack up in a head-to-head spec battle? Pretty evenly — except for the price. Read more This where a smart assistant can come to your rescue, like Tony Stark's AI-powered butler Jarvis. Rather than commanding each gadget in your home separately, you simply tell the butler what you need and it ensures that your will is done, regardless of which gadgets are required and what brand names they bear. Voice-controlled smart benchtop speakers such as Google Home and Amazon Echo are shaping up as the best candidates for the job. Rather than reaching for your smartphone you simply tell Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa what you need – using natural language rather than barking orders – and they take care of the rest. Meanwhile Harman Kardon's new Invoke smart speaker is bringing Microsoft's Cortana into homes, putting even more pressure on Apple to follow suit rather than relying on Siri built into smartphones and tablets. Microsoft Reveals Cortana-Powered Rival To Amazon Echo And Google Home With Microsoft's Build developer conference just two days away, the company has revealed one of the most anticipated announcements from the event. A new Cortana-powered speaker made by German audio giant Harman Kardon. Read more Think of these smart assistants a bit like a Logitech Harmony universal remote control which manages your entire home, focusing on tasks rather than devices. Tell your smart assistant what you want to do and it will execute a complicated string of commands across multiple devices to make it happen. Of course if you own a programmable universal remote like the Logitech Harmony you'll know that, while they're easy to use, they're a pain to set up. That's the next big challenge for the smart home, to make it simple for your average punter to integrate their smart speaker with third-party smart gadgets and ecosystems like Belkin WeMo, along with smart gateways like If This Then That. How To Make Google Assistant And Amazon Alexa Do Whatever You Want Image. Alex Cranz/Mario Aguilar/Gizmodo Our peaceful homes are being invaded by talking Bluetooth speakers and there's nothing you can do about it — so you might as well enlist the help of these AI-powered hubs and get them to do your bidding. Here's how to set up your own custom voice commands on Google Home or the Amazon Echo. Read more Of course you don't want to make things too simple and there will come a time when smart assistant makers are forced to restrict home admin rights to certain voices, lest your young children discover the full power at their disposal. Setting up Google Home to control WeMo gear is surprisingly simple and you can do it right now in Australia, it only took me five minutes. You just need to temporarily change your smartphone's location and language to US English, after which you can add smart home gear from WeMo, Nest, Philips Hue, LifX, Samsung SmartThings and a few others. Belkin's WeMo Smart LED Bulbs Put The Light Switch On Your Phone Belkin continues its pursuit of making home automation a simple plug-and-play affair with the introduction of its new Smart LED lightbulbs to its WeMo line. The 60-watt equivalent bulbs produce 800 lumens and cast a warm 3000 Kelvin glow across a room — so they should satisfy even those who've stocked up on incandescent bulbs. Read more Once they're linked to Google Home you can switch back to Australian English and still ask the smart speaker to turn on WeMo switches and other devices around your home. My next challenge is to see if I can hook up a Nest smart thermostat to my heating and cooling, to put them under the command of Google Assistant. Even Apple's traditionally closed ecosystem is opening up. You'll find a lot of AppleKit-compatible gear from the likes of D-Link and Elgato, but AppleKit-compatibility is also coming to Belkin's WeMo range so you'll be able to ask Siri to control your WeMo devices. Belkin WeMo Insight Switch: Australian Review The WeMo family of smart home gadgets and internet-connected appliances is growing. We've had quite a long wait for this particular apparatus, but you're finally able to pick it up in a JB Hi-Fi or Bunnings Warehouse near you — Belkin's energy-monitoring WeMo Insight Switch is finally available in Australia, with an Australian power plug. Read more Rather than one smart home ecosystem to rule them all, it looks like we're destined to choose one smart assistant to bring order to the smart home chaos. Have you put smart gadgets to work in your home and how do you keep them in order? Setting Up Your First Smart Home Getting started in the world of home automation may seem daunting, but it’s actually fairly simple. Depending on your goals, it can also be quite affordable, and even save you money over time. A smart home isn’t just some automatic lights either - there are loads of options to make day to day life that little bit easier. Read more This article originally appeared on SMH.

MYCROFT Connectivity An Open-Source (and Cute) Alternative to Amazon Echo Mycroft’s voice-enabled assistant is embodied in the startup’s friendly looking Mark 1 gadget, but you can build it into all kinds of devices. by Rachel Metz May 29, 2017 Mark 1 is no Amazon Echo: it looks like an ’80s clock radio mashed up with WALL-E, and speaks with a robotic, bass-heavy British accent. But the startup behind it, Mycroft, hopes it has similar appeal to hackers, students, and companies who want a voice-enabled assistant that they can run on all kinds of devices and alter at will. When it comes to voice-enabled digital assistants, there are plenty of them available these days—in addition to the Echo, which runs Amazon’s Alexa assistant, there’s Apple’s Siri, Microsoft’s Cortana, and Google’s assistant. None of these is open-source, though, so even if developers can use it on various devices (like Amazon’s Alexa), they can’t go under the hood and change its code—ostensibly, to help improve it. Mycroft—whose voice assistant, which runs on Mark 1, is also called Mycroft—isn’t trying to rival any of these big companies’ digital helpers, says CEO Joshua Montgomery. Rather, he says, the idea is to democratize the voice assistant—making it available and adaptable for everyone from kids working on school projects to companies that want to use open-source voice-enabled technology for a call center. While Mycroft will be free to individual users like consumers and developers, who can download it to run on things like computers and other devices, the company plans to charge enterprise users. Mark 1’s LED face has a friendly look. Mark 1, which is for sale online for $180, is a physical manifestation of what that can look like. “We decided to give it a face and to make it cute and personable so people would use it,” Montgomery says.

Incorrect email format Manage your newsletter preferences So far, there are about 90 skills users can activate for Mycroft; the company came up with about 16 of them and developers contributed the rest. They include things like setting reminders, playing music, making Facebook posts, and controlling lights and other connected devices at home. The device comes with some skills already installed, Montgomery says, and users can then add more. Montgomery showed off some of Mark 1’s capabilities for me, alerting it by saying “Hey, Mycroft”—to which a wavy LED line showed up on its face, as a sort of mouth—and then asking it a range of questions like “Who won the 1959 World Series?” and “How’s the weather in San Francisco?” Mark 1 uses Mycroft’s open-source voice-enabled assistant software to do things like check the weather and get the news. Most of the time, it answered correctly, using sources like Wikipedia and Wolfram Alpha to gather information. It was a little sluggish to respond, though, and it didn’t always do as it was told. The company tries to make it clear that it’s still a work in progress, and a more consumer-friendly version of Mycroft with greater capabilities is slated for next February. It can be set to use one of several different speech-to-text systems, including that of Google or IBM—and Mycroft is building its own open-source version, called OpenSTT.

Why India Keeps Making Grand Claims About Its Energy Future The company hopes Mycroft will fit in outside of the home, too. Car maker Jaguar Land Rover made a strategic investment in the company and plans to get its technology into vehicles within several years, Montgomery says. Carolina Milanesi, principal analyst covering consumer technology for tech market researcher Creative Strategies, thinks bringing Mycroft to the car or using it to imbue various home gadgets with voice interactions could be a good tactic, rather than trying to compete with much bigger players in the digital-assistant realm. There are a number of important issues to consider, though, such as how secure the data is that Mycroft is able to access. “For a lot of these interfaces, you’re starting to control very important parts of your life, from the home to the car, and these things need to be secure,” she notes. Montgomery says that user data sent to Mycroft will only be used by the company for improving its technology if users give permission to do so. This could make it tricky for Mycroft’s software to get better over time, though, as the more data it can draw on, the smarter it can get.

Official today, the ARM Cortex-A75 is the new flagship-tier mobile processor design, with a claimed 22 percent improvement in performance over the incumbent A73. It’s joined by the new Cortex-A55, which has the highest power efficiency of any mid-range CPU ARM’s ever designed, and the Mali-G72 graphics processor, which also comes with a 25 percent improvement in efficiency relative to its predecessor G71. The efficiency improvements are evolutionary and predictable, but the revolutionary aspects of this new lineup relate to artificial intelligence: this is the first set of processing components designed specifically to tackle the challenges of onboard AI and machine learning. Plus, last year’s updates to improve performance in the power-hugry tasks of augmented and virtual reality are being extended and elaborated. Before we dive into the detail of this year’s changes, it’s worth recapping what ARM does and why it’s important. This English company, now owned by Japan’s SoftBank, is responsible for designing the processor architecture of practically every mobile device — you’ll have heard of Qualcomm’s Snapdragon, Samsung’s Exynos, and Apple’s A-series of mobile chips, all of which are built using ARM’s instruction sets and based on ARM’s design blueprints. When we talk about the oncoming wave of mobile AI, mobile VR, and smartphones that can perform machine-learning tasks without sending them off to processor farms up in the cloud, developing the capabilities for those tasks starts with ARM. ARM The new Cortex-A75 and A55 are the first Dynamiq CPUs from ARM. Dynamiq is the branding chosen to describe a much more flexible set of design options for silicon vendors like Qualcomm. Where previously ARM allowed for designs that paired a cluster of so-called big CPUs (from its A7x class) and a matched number of little CPUs (from the A5x series), the new design makes it possible to spec a single, mixed-up cluster composed of both big and little CPUs, to a maximum of eight. Thus, chip makers can now have, for example, seven little A55 cores and just one big A75 one: for a favorable mix of long battery life, cost efficiency, and a high ceiling of single-threaded performance when it’s called for. "50x improvement in AI performance over the next three to five years" ARM marketing chief John Ronco says he anticipates a "50x improvement in AI performance over the next three to five years thanks to better architecture, micro-architecture, and software optimizations." ARM’s Dynamiq changes include a redesigned memory subsystem and tweaks to how CPU caches work — which has led to a doubling of memory streaming performance on the A55 relative to the A53 preceding it. Given that the A53 has shipped on 1.7 billion devices over the past three years, it’s truly the A55 that will make the biggest difference in achieving Ronco’s ambitious forecast. In most applications, the new mid-range core will be 10 to 30 percent better than previously, offering up to 15 percent better power efficiency and 18 percent better single-thread performance. But it’s the fact that the new chip designs will be 10 times more configurable, with up to 3,000 different configurations, that will allow chipmakers far greater flexibility to make the most of them by tailoring them to specific tasks. ARM The Cortex-A75 makes double-figure performance improvements across the board Interestingly, ARM won’t just be powering machine learning with its new chips, it’ll benefit from ML too. The new designs benefit from an improved branch predictor that uses neural network algorithms to improve data prefetching and overall performance. The Cortex-A75 makes double-figure performance improvements across the board, with ARM claiming it’s on average 22 percent better than the A73, with 16 percent higher memory throughput, and a 34 percent improvement in its Geekbench score. Single-threaded performance, according to ARM’s Ronco, is up by 20 percent, purely by improving the instructions-per-clock efficiency. The A75 chip is roughly 2.5x the size of the A55, and its intended uses are for infrastructure, automotive, and rich mobile applications. Yes, that means VR, AR, and high-fidelity games, the latter of which ARM’s research has shown have been rapidly increasing in popularity. A major architectural change with the A75 is the opening of a larger power envelope for chips using this core, scaling up to 2W of power consumption, and thus offering up to 30 percent of extra performance on larger-screen devices. This is entirely targeted at the upcoming Windows on ARM reboot, expected later this year. It’s worth noting that in ARM’s world a "large" screen basically amounts to a laptop — and the company set up a dedicated Large Screen Compute division a year and a half ago to more aggressively target the clamshell devices that Intel has been dominant in. ARM As to the new Mali GPU, it has 32 shader cores, 25 percent higher energy efficiency, and a 20 percent better performance density (aka performance per mm² of space). The Mali-G72 is at the heart of ARM’s push toward improving machine learning efficiency, and ARM claims it’s showing itself to be 17 percent better than the G71 in ML benchmarks. The design optimizations from the company are tailored to accelerate inference engines rather than training engines — that’s to say ARM chips will be best at using accumulated ML capabilities rather than developing them, which makes perfect sense for mobile applications. Training AI will be a task better left to Nvidia and AMD graphics cards or Google’s custom TensorFlow TPUs. The Cortex-A75 and A55 designs were released to ARM’s partners at the end of 2016, so by this point, they’ve all had a few months to decide what to do with them. ARM says a "realistic time window" for new mobile devices powered by its latest designs would be the first quarter of 2018 — though the company is also conscious of a new phenomenon it describes as "China speed," where Chinese phone vendors will put its designs into products almost immediately. The Huawei Mate 9, for example, was released just eight months after ARM distributed the Mali-G71 to partners. This faster Chinese cadence could lead to some A75- and A55-based designs this year, but then bulk of them are likely to arrive with the usual smartphone refresh cycle early next year.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 29 May 2017 | MYT 9:00 AM Why you can’t buy a car online – for now by rick popely More US car dealers are offering online services, but there isn't much integration with financing, trade-in values and other services consumers want online. — Dreamstime/TNS As bricks-and-mortar stores around the US close up and more retail sales shift to the Internet, the auto industry seems stuck in the past, plodding along in much the same way that it has for decades.  If you want to buy a new vehicle, you still have to schlep to a dealer, negotiate a price and sign a stack of documents before you drive away. With the notable exception of upstart Tesla Motors, which offers a completely online process, shoppers can start the buying process online, but ultimately they have to visit a dealership to close the purchase.  One reason is that manufacturers who have franchised dealers – everyone except Tesla – cannot compete with their dealers by selling directly to consumers either online or through company-owned stores, like Tesla or companies such as Apple. That is the law in all 50 US states, so buying from a dealership is the only avenue.  Though some consumers clamour for an entirely online experience, the traditional trek to a dealership is still the easiest route. A substantial portion of car buyers rely heavily on the services dealers provide, such as accepting trade-ins, arranging financing and having a selection of vehicles in stock they can see and test drive.  "Buying online is the path of least resistance" for a new-vehicle shopper who is not trading in a car and has good credit, so they are a cinch to get approved for a loan, said Mathew Desmond, head of the North American automotive consulting firm Capgemini.  But most customers will have a trade-in or need to discuss financing, which isn't well-integrated into manufacturer and dealer sites, Desmond said in a telephone interview.  "Dealers use technology heavily, and they're quite savvy, but when it comes to the challenge of integrating finance and insurance platforms for credit approval, for trade-ins and appraisals, and being sure that you have the right value for the vehicle, the integration of all those processes so that they work seamlessly for a great customer experience is a big challenge," he said.  All vehicle manufacturers and dealerships have internet sites, but there isn't a seamless transition from shopping on a manufacturer's site to actually buying a vehicle on a dealer's site. A customer who starts building and buying a car on the manufacturer's site might have to start over with the dealership.  Chicago-area dealer Mark Scarpelli, chairman of the National Automobile Dealers Association, said dealers are adapting to the changing retail landscape and upgrading their online services.  "We're getting to the point where credit applications can be submitted online to a dealership, obviously a car can be picked out, the price can be talked about and somewhat negotiated either on the telephone, through email or a website. All those functions are evolving," Scarpelli said.  "We're going with what the customer likes and dislikes. There's a lot of people who say, 'I'd love to be able to buy the car online, but I still want to negotiate' or 'I want to touch and feel that car, and I want to drive it.' Some of those functions can never be replicated online," he said, adding that many lenders still require borrowers to sign loan agreements in person at a dealership.  A 2016 survey of US consumers by Capgemini bears this out. Sixty percent said they were willing to buy a new car online, and 60% said they want to avoid sales pressure at a dealership. However, 88% said they want to see the vehicle or test-drive it, and 55% said they want to be able to negotiate the price – something they might not be able to do online.  Tesla allows shoppers to build a vehicle with features they choose and place an order online and pick it up at a delivery centre or have it delivered. Buyers also can purchase a vehicle out of inventory online or through a company-owned store. A brand called Lynk & Co that intends to launch in the US in 2019 plans a similar approach of selling directly to consumers online and through company-owned stores.  In comparison, Desmond said General Motors' Shop-Click-Drive program is an example of where other manufacturers are with online purchases. Consumers can shop dealer inventories online, pick a car, and check prices and financing options online, but they have to go to a dealer to complete the transaction and get an actual trade-in value.  GM launched Shop-Click-Drive in late 2013. A spokesman said about 72% of GM's 4,300 dealers participate and the "new- and used-vehicle leads generated by the program approached the half-million mark in 2016." He said he couldn't be more specific.  During that time, though, GM sold more than 9 million vehicles in the US, so it accounts for only a small portion of its total sales, indicating that a vast majority of consumers still do all of their vehicle purchases the old-fashioned way – by going straight to a dealership.  But with consumers making so many other retail purchases digitally, Desmond said that will prod the auto industry to change its approach in the near future so that most or all of a vehicle purchase can be completed online.  He believes that will happen through a partnership of manufacturers working with dealers – not the direct sales approach used by Tesla. Tesla skirts the laws against competing with franchise dealers because it has none (the company owns all Tesla stores).  Desmond said other manufacturers don't want to start wars with their dealers by trying to sell directly to consumers, but he says the current system needs to become more digitally oriented and seamless when manufacturers hand off customers to dealers.  "I don't believe there needs to be a replacement for dealers, but there could be more choices in addition to dealers or different types of experiences with dealers," he said.  "There seems to be a symbiotic relationship where the manufacturer produces the product and the franchised dealer network sells and services it. What it revolves around is customer choice, and the industry needs to provide more choice to customers to meet or exceed their expectations."  University of Michigan law professor Daniel Crane argues that the franchise laws that require manufacturers to sell through dealers have helped keep the auto industry in a 20th Century retail model that is inefficient and reduces choices for consumers.  "With changing technology both in terms of the cars and in which customers are used to buying more products online, now is a moment when the old business model isn't making as much sense as it once did," Crane said of the franchise dealer system that has been in place more than 100 years.  Auto companies should be allowed to choose their own way of selling cars, whether that is online, through stores they own or through dealers, like other businesses, Crane said.  Crane said Tesla may have to use franchised dealers to expand its sales and service network – something that CEO Elon Musk has said could happen – and adopt a hybrid distribution model like Apple, which sells products through its own stores as well as other retailers. Conversely, he added, car companies should be free to try other ways to sell to consumers other than through dealers.  "There are lots of different ways of doing distribution, and every seller has to figure the best way to get its product to market. Having more choice and flexibility is going to incentivize more companies to experiment to find the right pitch for their products," Crane said.  "What you ordinarily want to let happen is a competitive process in the market to sort out what is the best distribution method." — Chicago Tribune/Tribune News Service Related Stories You May Be Interested Malaysians love to Netflix, with or without the chill, at night Acquisitions accelerate as tech giants seek to build AI smarts Poor showing at Sudirman Cup costs Vivian-Khe Wei place in world meet Get smart about the idiot box The man who rebuilt this city Racing for a better tomorrow Others Also Read Star Media treats ePaper subscribers UK police arrest 16th person in connection with Manchester attack Muguruza hoping to avoid embarrassing exit in Paris advertisement Latest News Italian court overturns Uber ban Acquisitions accelerate as tech giants seek to build AI smarts Samsung Elec considers adding capacity at China chip plant Google Search introduces Personal tab to show users’ online content Lenovo’s struggling mobile business sets sight on high-end market Most Viewed in Tech More Heathrow chaos as BA scrambles to recover from IT crash Get smart about the idiot box Malaysians love to Netflix, with or without the chill, at night Lenovo’s struggling mobile business sets sight on high-end market US might ban laptops on all flights into and out of the country Google Search introduces Personal tab to show users’ online content Chipotle says hackers hit most restaurants in data breach BA cancels flights from London as global IT outage causes chaos Maintaining IPv4 is going to get expensive: expert Samsung Elec considers adding capacity at China chip plant Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

Instead, both iTunes and VUDU are individual rental movie services, where you only pay for what you want to watch and in what quality you want to watch it in. You also have the option to purchase the movie, but you’re not going to be forking over one-flat fee for all sorts of content, making these two services quite costly if you love to watch movies all the time. But for those who are habitual users and only want to pay for what they want to see, read on to see how they stack up against each other. Background Wal-Mart Stores bought video-streaming service Vudu.com a while back and it’s a service that allows you to stream directly to your compatible device via the Internet. The account is free and you only pay for whatever movies you watch since it’s an on-demand service. Many who are familiar with iOS and Apple’s Macs already know that iTunes is the place to get all your music downloads, store your MP3s and movies, and get apps and more. It’s the one-stop shop for your iOS devices basically. User Friendly Signing up with both VUDU and iTunes is free. Like all other services, you go through a signup process, where you pick out a username and password that allows you to access your account. Both allow you to browse around before even signing up so that you can easily check out the selection. Once you create an account, you can browse around on any of the compatible devices listed for both below. Winner: Tie Compatible Devices Since iTunes is iOS based, it’s limited in devices you can use to watch movies. So you have any iOS-based device (iPhones, iPads, iPod Touches and, of course Mac computers (and PCs if you download iTunes for it). Oh, and there’s Apple TV, too, which requires you to either buy or rent the movies via iTunes. Once you’ve done this on the Apple TV interface, you can download the movie to your computer running iTunes, too. VUDU works on a lot more devices than iTunes. So in addition to your iOS-based devices mentioned above, it’s available on PC computers, gaming consoles like PS3 and Xbox 360 (only if you have a LIVE Gold membership), in addition to a lot of other Internet-connected Blu-ray players and HDTVS. That basically means almost any device with Internet access really. Just go on the site and under the “Devices” tab, you can easily check out all the models that it works on (way too many to list). Winner: VUDU is compatible with more devices Titles According to VUDU, they have more than 20,000 titles to choose from, with more and more being added all the time. A good thing about it is that a lot of the releases include newer titles that have just been released on DVD and Blu-ray (many even the same day of release). They have a lot of HD movie options, too. iTunes say they have more than 75,000 digital downloads, with about 3,000 of those available in HD (and that’s including both movies and TV shows). VUDU also has TV show options available, but iTunes has the most current episode to date while VUDU has older seasons. Winner: VUDU has a lot of titles, but iTunes takes the cake with their whopping 75,000 digital downloads. Membership Perks Since both services don’t require a monthly membership and are more of movie-a-la-carte services, both offer various advantages to their service. VUDU provides an instant $5 credit for new members and provides movies that are in HDX quality that will totally enhance your viewing experience as if you were in the theatre (but probably with a way smaller screen). The streaming movie service can stream in 1080p and has rich Dolby Digital Plus 7.1 surround sound if you have the right home entertainment theatre system to support such massive audio. And because it’s a streaming service, the content starts right away. Also, you can watch the first 10 minutes of some movies for free to see if you’re down with it or not so that you don’t have to waste your cash if doesn’t catch your attention within the first couple of minutes (newer titles usually go up to two minutes plus they have the trailers, too). VUDU also offers a cool Collections tab that has more sub-tabs, with one being “Showcases” that shows you sale, reduced price and other discounted content you can watch without having to pay full price. Then when you refer a friend, you get a $3.99 credit! So even though it’s a pay-per-watch service, you can really save some cash on certain titles. And you can buy the movies (in most cases) if you want to keep them. VUDU also just started offering its Disc to Digital program that works with Walmart where you convert your old discs (some titles are not included) into digital copies on your VUDU account, even allowing you to upgrade old discs into HDX copies for a small fee at various Walmart location. iTunes is more of a download service and doesn’t allow you to stream. Movies are purchased or rented, with many HD options available. If you like shows, you can easily buy the entire season, even the most current one with new episodes automatically added to your account after they air. You can watch rentals for a certain time period and when it expires, the downloaded content is gone. And with AirPlay you can play content on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch on your HDTV via Apple TV. iTunes also offers lots of movie trailers so you can see what’s coming out in theaters soon. Sometimes it the main site for movies and shows on iTunes will provide discounted items. You can’t test out the movies like VUDU, but you can watch the movie’s trailer. You also have the option to pre-order movies that are coming out soon. Winner: VUDU offers WAY more advantages. Content Both are pretty even on this level. iTunes has a movie catalogue that features movies and stuff from the likes of many big studios, including 20th Century Fox, Warner Bros. Walt Disney Pictures, Paramount Pictures, Sony Pictures and Universal Studios. They also work with lots of TV channels to offer the latest episodes on many of your favorite shows. Then again, VUDU also has all the big movie deals given they release content as soon as it hits DVD. Winner: Tie since both offer a wide array of content, which is why they have so many titles each Speed of Service VUDU streams movies, so you can watch instantly, while you have to download it from iTunes, which can take a while depending on your Internet service, your phone service for mobile devices, etc. BUT< you don’t have to wait for the download to completely finish before watching the movie.You can also watch some of the movie on your Mac, then halfway through, transfer to your iPod or iPhone and pick up watching where you last left off. VUDU’s minimum speed requirements for its services is: 480p: 1 Mbps for SD; 720p: 2.25 Mbs for HD; and 1080p: 4.5 Mbps for HDX.  Winner: VUDU streams faster with less delays Quality It’s pretty even here, too, since both offer HD quality movies and TV shows in 720p and 1080p. VUDU has some 3D titles (but you need 3D devices to watch them in 3D obviously). But VUDU does offer that Dolby Digital Plus 7.1 surround sound providing a slight edge over iTunes. Winner: VUDU has 3D movies and that Dolby Digital Plus 7.1 Limitations So iTunes used to offer TV show rentals, but they got rid of that option in August 2011 and VUDU offers that still. With iTunes Apple TV, movies rented on the device aren’t allowed to be transferred to other devices so that’s not good. For those who don’t have Apple TV, they have to buy other special cables so they can watch from their computer or another device on your TV. VUDU doesn’t offer an Android-based app, so that sucks. For VUDU, people who want to download the moves to their iPhones or iPads can stream movies but can’t keep them on their device. Winner: VUDU has less limitations Price Both offer content-on-demand services with options to rent or buy so you pay for what you want to watch and/or buy. For iTunes, newer releases will run you about $3.99 for SD and $4.99 for HD options. Usually older movies are cheaper like about $2.99. If you to actually buy the content, you’ll going to pay anywhere between $10.99-$14.99 for SD versions, with HD ones going up to $19.99 and up. TV shows are usually more to buy since they include a lot of episodes. VUDU prices vary a bit and can cheaper than iTunes, especially with discounted ones on that special VUDU page. Some titles cost $2 to rent for two nights, others are about $5, with HDX options the most expensive ones. For newer SD movies, you’ll pay $3.99 and HD titles go for $4.99, but you even have the choice to go with HDX for $5.99. Owning them is about the same as iTunes. Winner: Tie since both offer around the same prices for the majority of content Overall Winner Despite both being a buy-want-you-want movie service, VUDU offers a bit more for your buck, making it the winner in our comparison. Since you’re only going to pay for what you want, you might as well get the most out of the experience and VUDU has multiple options in terms of quality, offers 3D movies and that Dolby Digital Plus 7.1 is pretty nice. The fact that you can test out movies before you buy is also a good thing and all those discounts on the site always make watching movies you wouldn’t usually want to rent at its regular price totally worth the try!

I am returning from flying overseas . When you land in another country, Vudu kicks you out and you can not sign into your account. All your downloads “expire” until you return to the US. In Tahiti I downloaded and watched “John Wick II” from iTunes. Bottom line : Vudu won’t work on return flights once you have left and the US. iTunes will. Reply Fee on I have all Apple products and love them. I enjoy iTunes but I find myself going more toward VUDU when it comes to looking, buying, renting movies. I guess it is because it is very user friendly, there are good deals and freebies. I have both a BluRay player with VUDU on it as well as an AppleTV, MacBook, and Apple iPhone. So if you have both ways to utilize iTunes and VUDU you really can’t lose out on what they both offer. Neat to have “Blockbuster” in your home so to speak, ya know? => Reply Denz on VUDU all the way. Nice big boobs Kristie.. Reply Brady Gorman on I actually use both. With iTunes, the picture quality is slightly higher with an Apple TV and some even offer the same bonus features as their Blu-ray/DVD counterparts, but I can get better quality digital copies with Vudu (for a little extra). Also, one just may have a movie that the other doesn’t. Since they’re both free in terms of membership, I’d say you wouldn’t go wrong using both. Reply Michael tristan on Inherently flawed reasearch and especially flawed writing EXAMPLE: “Winner: VUDU has a lot of titles, but iTunes takes the cake with their whopping 75,000 digital downloads.” iTunes wins this but either poor writing or a clear bias makes Vudu appear to win this… This is so ridiculous, ill stop here.. A technologically advanced back end will never overcome a lack of content. Reply Graydon Patterson on one detail you left out, VUDO wont work in Canada, itunes will Reply David on I have used itunes to purchase movies and redeem digital copies for years and I prefer vudu by a long shot now. For starters if you buy a blu ray disk that includes a digital copy shouldn’t that digital copy also be in HD? Well most of the itunes digital copies are SD with no option to upgrade to HD. I alzo love the disk to digital service offered by uv/vudu. For renting movies I love it because most new titles are available the they are released on dvd and they are all available in HD. I wish i could transfer all of my itunes purchases to uv/vudu. Reply James on Kristie.. Great article! Are those real? Reply Long time movie watcher on Wow, I have both and while your article is extensive it is heavily biased. The title should be renamed to why you like VUDU. As an example of proof, you list VUDU as being compatible with more devices but don’t go into to many details then towards the end you mention it’s not compatible with Android. Seems kinda left out of your scoring. Also I didn’t notice any mention that VUDU really doesn’t work well on iOS devices. Checkout the reviews of their app for yourself. That being said I own more on iTunes I own more yet I’ve watched more rentals on VUDU. They are almost apples and oranges but I still prefer buying Blu-rays and renting from Blockbuster. Reply CJ on I have both and will be using VUDU for all of my future purchases since I am able to watch directly from my blu-ray player, TV and gaming console. When she says VUDU works on more devices she is talking about the VUDU app which is native on most blu-ray players, gaming consoles and TVs. Reply Jacko on Thanks Kristie. Trying to work thru the maze of offerings is tough. This was pretty darn good. You are soft on the eyes and thats only a plus. Appreciate your commentary and homework.

This tool will repair most computer errors, protect you from file loss, malware, hardware failure and optimize your PC for maximum performance. Quickly fix PC issues and prevent others from happening with this software: Download ReimagePlus (100% safe download and endorsed by us). Click “Start Scan” to find Windows issues that could be causing PC problems. Click “Repair All” to fix all issues. The new Surface Pro will be available on June 15 starting at $799, but you can also opt for a demo version in Microsoft Stores. The enemy The Surface Pro is here to compete with Apple. Ryan Day from Microsoft made it clear that they designed Surface Pro for people who possess an iPad Pro. And I think the new Surface Pro is a lot closer to being a laptop replacement, unlike the 12.9inch iPad Pro. The Keyboard The Microsoft Keyboards always stand out. The new Surface Pro Type Cover Keyboard have a tiny distance between the keys which is a lot easier for all the fast typers out there, distance to fully push down a key and great tactile feedback. However, there are two issues that need improvement: The Keyboard Material The Alcantara material feels nice and looks good and is a high-end product, (you obviously need to take care of it) but over time it can become a little bit of a problem. The majority of laptops opt for all-metal surfaces because it’s more durable and difficult to stain. I’m not quite sure if the Alcantra will overdue the all-metal design option for the devices but we’ll see after a period of time. The Keyboard Is Selling Separately The Surface Pro is clearly nothing without the Type Cover Keyboard. It’s like buying a laptop without a keyboard and you need to pay an extra $160 for it, because $1,299 wasn’t much at all. Also, it comes in four different colors, giving users the possibility to choose one for their own taste. Baterry Life With a new Intel 7th Gen Core processor, the new Surface Pro boasts 50% longer battery life than the older version, meaning 13.5 hours rather than 9 on the Surface Pro 4. Display It has 12.3inch and a 2736px1824p (267ppi) resolution. The New Surface Pen It is selling separately for $99 with tilt support and 4096 levels of sensitivity pressure, perfect for those who use the device for making art.

Lawmakers were resolving last-minute issues ahead of Monday's final adjournment — but their focus was already shifting to whether Gov. Greg Abbott would order them back to work if a law, like the one that caused national uproar and costly boycotts when it was approved last year in North Carolina, doesn't pass in Texas. "I think it's dead for the regular session between now and tomorrow," said Rep. Ron Simmons, a Republican from Carrollton in suburban Dallas who pushed a version of the bathroom bill in the Texas House. A Democrat hasn't won statewide office since 1994 in Texas, the longest political losing streak in the nation, and the state so relishes small government that its Legislature only convenes every other year. That means state lawmakers won't meet again until 2019, unless Abbott calls a special session, which lasts 30 days and can cover any issue the governor chooses. Abbott has said previously he's hesitant to drag legislators back to work over any issue, but he's also bucked other GOP governors in supporting legislation that could impose transgender restroom restrictions. Abbott spokesman John Wittman declined comment Sunday, referring queries to a statement he released Friday night saying: "The taxpayers deserve to have the Legislature finish their work on time." Tensions between the state Senate and House — both Republican-controlled — have been building for months but boiled over during the final weekend. The more conservative Senate passed a comprehensive law months ago compelling transgender Texans to use public restrooms corresponding to the gender on their birth certificates. The House last weekend approved a scaled-back measure applying only to public schools, which educate roughly 5.3 million students, more than any other state except California. It bars transgender students from choosing the bathroom they use, but allows schools to direct them to separate, single occupancy facilities. The Senate rejected the House version as too watered down. But Republican House Speaker Joe Straus, who has long opposed the bathroom bill as potentially bad for Texas' economy, said his chamber would go no further. Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, a former radio talk show host who oversees the Senate and loves picking conservative fights, responded by imploring Abbott to call a special session. Adding to the tensions was a Saturday letter from Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, Apple CEO Tim Cook and a dozen other tech industry giants. They urged abandoning the bathroom bill. The NFL and NBA have hinted that approving it could cost Texas future top sporting events — even though Houston successfully hosted the Super Bowl in February. Leading businesses and lobbyists have also rejected the would-be law, and top Hollywood and music stars have hinted at state boycotts should it pass. ___ BILL WOULD EXPAND BOARD OF EDUCATION TEXTBOOK VETO POWER The Texas Legislature has approved giving the state's often-combative Board of Education broader veto power over textbooks used across the state. A bill passed in its final form by the state House 78-62 on Sunday lets the board's 15 elected members reject textbook content deemed not "suitable for the subject and grade level." It now goes to Gov. Greg Abbott who can sign or veto it, or allow it to automatically become law. Critics worry the proposal weakens limits in place since 1995, which only allow the board to seek edits to textbooks for factual errors or to better align with Texas curriculum. Even with those, board ideological battles over textbooks have long made national headlines. Texas' textbook market is large enough to affect textbook content in other states. ___ VOTER ID BILL HEADS TO ABBOTT The GOP-controlled Texas Legislature has approved a weakened voter ID law and sent it to Gov. Greg Abbott after a judge twice ruled that the original version deliberately tried to suppress minority voters. The changes given final approval Sunday expanded the list of acceptable IDs first devised in the original 2011 law to include passport cards and recently expired identifications. Still, gun licenses remain acceptable while college IDs aren't. The new law would let people without an ID cast a ballot by signing an affidavit. But anyone lying on affidavits could be charged with a felony. In April, a federal judge reaffirmed that the original law intentionally discriminated. Democrats now want the judge to force Texas to get federal permission before changing election laws under the Voting Rights Act. ___ LEGISLATURE APPROVES 'POLICE INTERACTION' PROPOSAL The Texas Legislature has voted to require all public high schools to provide instruction on how to best interact with law enforcement in traffic stops and other situations. The bill by Democratic Sens. Royce West of Dallas and John Whitmire of Houston is in response to a series of violent encounters between police and the public that made national news. The sponsors want to teach students what's expected of them when interacting with police. It also requires drivers' education courses to include information on how to act during traffic stops. Also mandated would be instruction for police officers on their responsibilities during an encounter. The bill now heads to the desk of Gov. Greg Abbott, who can sign or veto it. If he takes no action, it becomes law automatically. ___ ON DECK Monday is the 140th and final day of the legislative session. Both the House and Senate should have relatively light schedules, and when they are finished, lawmakers won't convene anew until January 2019 — unless Gov. Greg Abbott opts to call a special session. ___ QUOTE OF THE DAY "For the record, patience is a virtue that I do not have. But I hope I've been polite" — Sen. Judith Zaffirini, arguing Sunday evening with Houston Republican Sen. Paul Betancourt over a bill that would excuse some poor Texans from paying qualifying court-ordered fines in full.

Lawmakers were resolving last-minute issues ahead of Monday's final adjournment — but their focus was already shifting to whether Gov. Greg Abbott would order them back to work if a law, like the one that caused national uproar and costly boycotts when it was approved last year in North Carolina, doesn't pass in Texas. "I think it's dead for the regular session between now and tomorrow," said Rep. Ron Simmons, a Republican from Carrollton in suburban Dallas who pushed a version of the bathroom bill in the Texas House. A Democrat hasn't won statewide office since 1994 in Texas, the longest political losing streak in the nation, and the state so relishes small government that its Legislature only convenes every other year. That means state lawmakers won't meet again until 2019, unless Abbott calls a special session, which lasts 30 days and can cover any issue the governor chooses. Abbott has said previously he's hesitant to drag legislators back to work over any issue, but he's also bucked other GOP governors in supporting legislation that could impose transgender restroom restrictions. Abbott spokesman John Wittman declined comment Sunday, referring queries to a statement he released Friday night saying: "The taxpayers deserve to have the Legislature finish their work on time." Tensions between the state Senate and House — both Republican-controlled — have been building for months but boiled over during the final weekend. The more conservative Senate passed a comprehensive law months ago compelling transgender Texans to use public restrooms corresponding to the gender on their birth certificates. The House last weekend approved a scaled-back measure applying only to public schools, which educate roughly 5.3 million students, more than any other state except California. It bars transgender students from choosing the bathroom they use, but allows schools to direct them to separate, single occupancy facilities. The Senate rejected the House version as too watered down. But Republican House Speaker Joe Straus, who has long opposed the bathroom bill as potentially bad for Texas' economy, said his chamber would go no further. Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, a former radio talk show host who oversees the Senate and loves picking conservative fights, responded by imploring Abbott to call a special session. Adding to the tensions was a Saturday letter from Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, Apple CEO Tim Cook and a dozen other tech industry giants. They urged abandoning the bathroom bill. The NFL and NBA have hinted that approving it could cost Texas future top sporting events — even though Houston successfully hosted the Super Bowl in February. Leading businesses and lobbyists have also rejected the would-be law, and top Hollywood and music stars have hinted at state boycotts should it pass. ___ BILL WOULD EXPAND BOARD OF EDUCATION TEXTBOOK VETO POWER The Texas Legislature has approved giving the state's often-combative Board of Education broader veto power over textbooks used across the state. A bill passed in its final form by the state House 78-62 on Sunday lets the board's 15 elected members reject textbook content deemed not "suitable for the subject and grade level." It now goes to Gov. Greg Abbott who can sign or veto it, or allow it to automatically become law. Critics worry the proposal weakens limits in place since 1995, which only allow the board to seek edits to textbooks for factual errors or to better align with Texas curriculum. Even with those, board ideological battles over textbooks have long made national headlines. Texas' textbook market is large enough to affect textbook content in other states. ___ VOTER ID BILL HEADS TO ABBOTT The GOP-controlled Texas Legislature has approved a weakened voter ID law and sent it to Gov. Greg Abbott after a judge twice ruled that the original version deliberately tried to suppress minority voters. The changes given final approval Sunday expanded the list of acceptable IDs first devised in the original 2011 law to include passport cards and recently expired identifications. Still, gun licenses remain acceptable while college IDs aren't. The new law would let people without an ID cast a ballot by signing an affidavit. But anyone lying on affidavits could be charged with a felony. In April, a federal judge reaffirmed that the original law intentionally discriminated. Democrats now want the judge to force Texas to get federal permission before changing election laws under the Voting Rights Act. ___ LEGISLATURE APPROVES 'POLICE INTERACTION' PROPOSAL The Texas Legislature has voted to require all public high schools to provide instruction on how to best interact with law enforcement in traffic stops and other situations. The bill by Democratic Sens. Royce West of Dallas and John Whitmire of Houston is in response to a series of violent encounters between police and the public that made national news. The sponsors want to teach students what's expected of them when interacting with police. It also requires drivers' education courses to include information on how to act during traffic stops. Also mandated would be instruction for police officers on their responsibilities during an encounter. The bill now heads to the desk of Gov. Greg Abbott, who can sign or veto it. If he takes no action, it becomes law automatically. ___ ON DECK Monday is the 140th and final day of the legislative session. Both the House and Senate should have relatively light schedules, and when they are finished, lawmakers won't convene anew until January 2019 — unless Gov. Greg Abbott opts to call a special session. ___ QUOTE OF THE DAY "For the record, patience is a virtue that I do not have. But I hope I've been polite" — Sen. Judith Zaffirini, arguing Sunday evening with Houston Republican Sen. Paul Betancourt over a bill that would excuse some poor Texans from paying qualifying court-ordered fines in full.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars AI Guest Voicebot market growing faster than ever, but here’s a realistic take S. Jason Prohaska, MediaMonks May 28, 2017 4:54 PM Image Credit: Shutterstock.com/Peppinuzzo Voice technology that power devices like Amazon’s Alexa and Google Home is the next frontier for tech companies. Facebook’s announcement to launch ParlAI recently only intensified the industry’s ambition to reach the ultimate goal of having meaningful conversations with computers by voice. But let’s hold our horses; we’re not there yet. At my company, we’re receiving increasing requests from brands eager to explore this emerging utility, and at the same time, working with engineering and product teams to understand exactly what it can do. As it stands, we still have leaps to make, but one thing is sure: voice activated tech is set to get smarter, faster. Recently, I was speaking with a top executive at a leading global consumer products company and while watching TV, he saw an interesting ad for a similar product to his own. This prompted him to test Alexa. He asked what the best brand for the product category was. Alexa promptly responded with a list of competitors. Later, one offered to send him a sample, and the other listed best prices. This goes to show that while we may not yet be having meaningful conversations, voice activated tech is rising and so too are opportunities for brands to embrace it. The good, the bad and the promising A recent study shows the US market for voice-activated assistants has grown nearly 130% since 2016. Today, Amazon Echo (Alexa) and Google Home — which differ from Apple’s Siri and Google Now in that they’re independent, stationary devices — dominate the market. Their main function is to provide a “smarter home” by calling up music, reminding you of your agenda, and even answering trivia questions. One of the biggest benefits of voice-activated tech is saving time. Speaking is more natural than writing, and because you don’t have to take out your phone, it’s faster too. It’s also more accessible for those who, for one reason or another, aren’t able to use keyboards or screens. Enthusiasts such as Hugh Durkin, a Product Manager for Intercom, have even exclaimed: “Soon, unnecessary typing and tapping on a keyboard will be a memory of the distant past.” Perhaps. But this feature is still prone to error. When many people are speaking close to a device at once, they tend to have difficulty actually hearing the activation phrase. In the end, if you have to repeat your request again and again, it can be more time consuming than just walking over to flip a switch. There’s also the issue of privacy to consider. Burger King’s recent TV ad using “OK, Google” is a prime example of this. The ad used the wake word “OK, Google” to prompt devices to describe its burgers, but within hours of release — and hilarious edits to the Whopper Wikipedia page — the commercial was pulled. The widespread coverage of this highlighted that voice technology is still new for many, and the idea of anyone, or anything, listening to what people is unnerving. These issues are mere glitches, however. The biggest challenge is that although we’ve created processes that allow computers to get better at translation, voice recognition and speech synthesis, most computers still don’t understand the meaning of language. Mark Zuckerberg said himself: “No AI system is good enough to understand conversational speech just yet. [It] relies on both listening to what you say and predicting what you will say next, structured speech is still much easier to understand than unstructured conversation.” And, research confirms the average person is struggling to find value adopting voice tech in their daily lives. Brands should start preparing for tomorrow, starting today At it stands, the list of current limitations is long. Despite these drawbacks, advances in machine learning mean that computers are getting better at recognizing what people are saying. We’re not there yet, but Zuckerberg’s ambition may not be far off. In 2011, the global voice recognition market was valued at nearly 47 billion. Six year later that figure has more than doubled to 113 billion. Along with Facebook’s new announced investment, there’s a rush to accelerate the transition from speech recognition to natural language processing at scale. Once this is achieved, Zuckerberg’s wish for computers to have more sophisticated conversations will become possible. Brands can start preparing for this new frontier today. As my earlier example of Alexa demonstrates, soon more and more consumers will be turning to these products to compare, review and shop. Brands need to anticipate this change now by integrating these devices in their e-commerce and marketing strategies. In much the same way online shopping transformed the brick and mortar retail experience, voice activation technology will take this further. Each day, the promise of meaningful conversation and results-oriented solutions provided by humans interfacing with computers is evolving. Let’s all continue to explore and contribute to these technologies as they become smarter, and more meaningful…one word at a time. S.

Brett Hershman Benzinga May 28, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share View photos Maybe the Occupy Wall Street movement was looking to the wrong coast all along. A recent Bank of America Corp (NYSE: BAC)/Merrill Lynch report titled "Occupy Silicon Valley" shows that tech firms Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) valuations are higher than the GDP of every U.S. city besides Los Angeles and New York, and Apple is quickly gaining on L.A. While these figures do not mean these companies are actually worth more than those cities, it does present a relevant conversation about the sheer size and influence these firms have. Apple and Google essentially operate as their own countries, with massive power; their decisions have huge implications on the market and how citizens operate, communicate and conduct daily lives. Here at Benzinga, we wanted to take it a step further and see how these two tech giants stack up against countries worldwide, comparing Market Cap against GDP. Apple And Google Vs. The World (Figures In Millions) View photos apple_vs_the_world.pngMore Apple’s market cap is current just north of $796 billion, which would put it as the 17th most valuable country in the world, just ahead of the Netherlands, when compared to current World Bank data on global GDP. Google would rank as the 19th most valuable country in the world, ahead of international finance hub Switzerland, at a $672 billion valuation. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) would rank as the 25th biggest country in the world, just behind Poland, with a $467 billion market cap. While these are not apples-to-apples comparisons, it is the best way to gauge the sheer size the tech industry has amassed in the United States. With the presidency now hosting non-traditional and political amateur Donald Trump in the Oval Office, maybe Tim Cook — with his breadth of experience, financial prowess and general popularity — will capitalize and run for president in 2020.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Site Archive Awarding excellence: Dr. Prem Reddy Family Foundation awards $57K in scholarships to local students Sunday May 28, 2017 at 4:27 PM May 28, 2017 at 4:28 PM The scholarship program, open to all High Desert residents enrolled in an accredited health care or medical-related degree program, was created to reward students who have achieved academic excellence while being involved in school and community services. Paola Baker Staff Writer @DP_PaolaBaker SPRING VALLEY LAKE — Several local students are closer to the career of their dreams thanks to the generosity of a local businessman and his family. The Dr. Prem Reddy Family Foundation, founded by Prime Healthcare CEO Dr. Prem Reddy and his family in 1994, awarded $57,000 in academic scholarships to 45 local students during a recent awards ceremony held at the Spring Valley Lake Country Club. The scholarship program, open to all High Desert residents enrolled in an accredited health care or medical-related degree program, was created to reward students who have achieved academic excellence while being involved in school and community services. Community involvement was key, according to award winner Zackery Moroste. The 22-year-old Apple Valley native is currently enrolled in California Baptist University’s nursing program and aims to become a nurse anesthetist. Moroste touched on his chaotic childhood growing up with a drug-addicted parent, and how childhood illness and support from his community inspired him to enter the world of medicine. “I’d get sick a lot and end up in the hospital, and became fascinated with medicine,” Moroste said. “And because I’d get sick so much, I received so much support from my local community. It inspired me to go for my career and want to give back.” Moroste’s story, and the stories of all recipients, were expanded on by Dr. Reddy’s daughter and foundation founder Dr. Kavitha Reddy Bhatia, who drew parallels between the recipients’ lives and her own family’s journey. From premature-born twins turned into budding pediatricians, to the single mother of five reaching out to other single mothers while pursuing her own goals, the recipients all embodied the foundation’s focus on giving opportunities to those giving back to their communities. “Winston Churchill said, ‘You make a living by what you get, but you make a life by what you give,’” guest speaker Dr. John Morris said, addressing students directly. “Finish your training programs and go out there and do something great.” Paola Baker may be reached at 760-955-5332 or PBaker@VVDailyPress.com.

Weather Your 4-day local weather forecast Monday May 29, 2017 News Business Larger / SmallerNight Mode 8@eight: Positive open in store for ASX Chris Weston 29 May 2017, 9:13 a.m. Local shares are set to start the week in positive territory on what is expected to be a light trading session with markets in China, the UK and the US closed for holidays. 8@eight: Positive open in store for ASX The information of stocks that lost in prices are displayed on an electronic board inside the Australian Securities Exchange, operated by ASX Ltd., in Sydney, Australia, on Friday, July 24, 2015. The Australian dollar slumped last week as a gauge of Chinese manufacturing unexpectedly contracted, aggravating the impact of declines in copper and iron ore prices. Photographer: Brendon Thorne/Bloomberg Photo: Brendon Thorne Tweet Facebook of ╳ exit Local Business A light session in US trade on Friday it may have been, with volumes running some 25 per cent below the 30-day average through the S&P 500. However, one can still make money in a low volume environment and new highs have been seen and we should see Asian markets open on somewhat of a firmer footing. 1. Low volatility: Predictably the low volatility environment continues to be a dominant theme, with the US volatility index ("VIX") closing firmly below the 10 level. "When in doubt sell volatility", the hedge funds cry and that continues to be a trade that has worked well for some time. Everything from central banks seems so predictable these days, even Trump is predictable when it comes to saying something outrageous and the shock factor is being priced out of markets. However, throw in extremely low implied volatility ("VIX"), low realised volatility, solid earnings from US, European and Japanese corporates and you can see why so few are expecting range expansion and price volatility to be on-going dominant theme any great degree going forward. So the ongoing grind higher in the US and developed equities should continue in my opinion. The Emerging market trade I have been pushing is now looking quite good, with the EEM (Emerging Markets ETF) breaking to the highest levels since May 2015. 2. Wall Street: There has also been a renewed focus on the market breadth of late too in US equities, given around 30 per cent of the gains this year in the S&P 500 have come from Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook. However, if we look at the market internals we can see 18 per cent of companies at a four-week high, which is fairly low considering the index is at an all-time high, but not terrible. If anything, it tells me there is further upside here, especially when you see a mere 59 per cent of S&P 500 companies trading above their 50-day moving average. There are just no signs of euphoric conditions and the index is not over loved in any way. 3. ASX: If we aggregate the US leads, include a solid 2.8 per cent reversal in US crude (from Fridays ASX 200 cash close) and hefty sell-off in iron ore (spot fell 3.9 per cent, while Dalian futures were down 1.2 per cent) we should the ASX 200 open a touch higher, with SPI futures closing up seven points. Weekend news has been quite light, although there are breaking headline around further missile tests from North Korea, but thus far limited moves in USD/JPY suggest a flat open to futures markets at 08:00 aest. The bulls desperately need to see a convincing closing break above 5803. 4. Trump returns: We can also see broad financial conditions continue to improve, with the Bloomberg US financial conditions index pushing up to the highest level since September 2014. The week ahead see's Trump back on home soil after a dominant trip abroad and one suspects he, Kushner et al will retain their spot in the limelight for all the wrong reasons. 5. US data flow: We will also keep an eye on US data points this week the data points like core PCE, consumer confidence, vehicle sales, ISM manufacturing and non-farm payrolls in view. But if financial conditions remain at such extremely accommodative levels it really puts the probability of a June hike at a very high prospect. Recall, the Fed are looking through the weak Q1 GDP print, which was revised up 50 basis points on Friday to 1.2 per cent as "transitory", but there are a few reasons for them to perhaps play a slightly more cautionary note, and look to hike in July instead, although again the base case remains a June hike. This week's US data flow could settle that argument. 6. Europe in focus: I would also be focusing on Europe this week given the market love affair with EUR assets. Speculative FX futures positioning in EUR/USD increased a lazy 74 per cent last week and at 64,845 contracts is the largest net long position speculative traders have held on EUR futures since October 2013. If we look at how far EUR/USD has overrun relative to the US/German bond spread it suggests some downside risks this week to EUR/USD and this pair will no doubt get a good working over from clients. Specifically, look to Wednesdays Eurozone CPI estimate, where consensus believes that inflation should fall from 1.9 per cent to 1.5 per cent. This could be a trigger for profit-taking in EUR. 7. Big week of data: Aside from offshore factors, there is quite a lot for local traders to navigate through, specifically on the Aussie data front. There have been calls from some economists that we are set for a very benign quarter of growth, although the consensus still sits for Q1 GDP of 60 basis points (or 0.6 per cent). This view could change this week with building approvals, private sector credit, Q1 CAPEX and retail sales in play. I would be paying close attention to the Australia/US 10-year bond yield spread, which closed at 16 basis points on Friday and effectively detailed the lowest premium Aussie bonds have held over US Treasuries since May 2000. With the swaps market pricing two basis points of cuts over the coming 12 months, these growth drivers could impact this spread and perhaps market pricing around future RBA action and in turn, the AUD will be sensitive to these changes. It's hard to pick a range, but we can use the options market as a guide and here we see an at-the-money $0.7450 weekly 'straddle' costing 57 pips. That will change when implied volatility kicks in for the start of the week, but for now, the market is saying they expect a modest 57 point move (in either direction) for the AUD/USD and that seems a tad too low for me. 8. Market watch: SPI futures up 7 points or 0.1% to 5763 AUD -0.1% to 74.48 US cents On Wall St, Dow flat, S&P 500 flat, Nasdaq +0.1% Wall Street is closed on Monday (Tuesday AEST) In New York, BHP -1%, Rio -1% In Europe, Stoxx 50 -0.2%, FTSE +0.4%, CAC flat, DAX -0.2% Spot gold +0.9% to $US1266.76 an ounce Brent crude +1.3% to $US52.15 a barrel US oil +2% to $US49.87 a barrel Iron ore -3.9% to $US57.91 a tonne Dalian iron ore -0.7% to 454 yuan LME aluminium -0.4 % to $US1952 a tonne LME copper -1.1% to $US5657.50 a tonne 10-year bond yield: US 2.25%, Germany 0.33%, Australia 2.41% This column was produced in commercial partnership between Fairfax Media and IG The story 8@eight: Positive open in store for ASX first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.

Thor Jensen 05.28.2017 :: 12:00PM EDT kthorjensen Being able to press a button and get a movie instantly sent to your TV is sort of the stuff of science fiction anyways, so it’s not surprising that Netflix has a pretty solid selection of sci-fi to stream. Picking through all of the detritus, though, can be a slog. There are a lot of lousy low-budget disease pandemic freakouts and cyborg fight club cheapies to skip over. If you don’t feel like scrolling forever to find the cream of the crop, we’ve got your back. What follows is a list of the 11 must-watch science fiction flicks that are streaming right now on Netflix. We’ll update it as movies are added and removed, so bookmark this page. You’ll want to come back to it when you’re setting up for a binge. Turbo Kid Created by an idiosyncratic Canadian filmmaking collective, Turbo Kid is a gore-soaked post-apocalyptic homage to classic 80s sci-fi flicks with a personality all its own. When the Kid discovers the armor and wrist blaster of his favorite superhero Turbo Rider, it brings him into conflict with a warlord who grinds up his enemies to extract their precious water. Along with a beautiful female robot named Apple and a one-handed arm wrestling champion, the Kid finds his inner strength and helps change the world for the better. It’s charming, beautifully shot and acted, and a ton of fun. A Trip To The Moon It’s sort of amazing that you can watch a movie from over a century ago whenever you want. Doubly so that it’s the 1902 Georges Méliès classic A Trip To The Moon, which is basically the first science fiction movie ever released. Based on a pair of Jules Verne stories, it tells the tale of a group of scientists who blast off to the Moon, meet the warlike race that lives there, and escape back to Earth. Sure, the science is… a little goofy, to say the least, but the filmmaking craft is astonishing when you consider the technical limitations, and it’s wildly imaginative even 114 years later. The Road John Hillcoat’s adaptation of the Cormac McCarthy novel is one of the grimmest and most uncompromising movies on this list, a stark illustration of post-apocalypse reality. Viggo Mortensen is astounding as a scavenger who will do anything to keep his son alive, and the cinematography is nothing short of brilliant. This isn’t a feel-good film by any means, and everybody involved commits unflinchingly to the atmosphere of the movie. It’s one of the least commercial sci-fi films to ever come out of Hollywood and definitely deserves your time and attention. Primer Shane Carruth’s brilliant $7,000 debut is the best kind of science fiction: one that warps your brain as you watch it. When a pair of engineers accidentally invent a device that loops time in their garage, it sets off a mentally taxing series of journeys that will have you making diagrams on graph paper to keep up. The guys do what any smart person would do – get rich on the stock market – but when one thinks things have gone too far and tries to go back in time to prevent himself from inventing the device, all Hell breaks loose. Carruth’s higher-budget but no less thoughtful follow-up Upstream Color is also streaming, so watch that too. Barbarella Based on the French comics of Jean-Claude Forest, this 1968 Jane Fonda vehicle is a slice of swinging 60s sexploitation that’s visually exhausting. Fonda plays the titular heroine with a heaping dollop of camp, mugging her way through increasingly ridiculous situations like battling off carnivorous dolls and overloading an “orgasm machine” with her furious libido. It’s about as politically incorrect as you can get, but the costumes by Paco Rabanne are insanely good, the production design is great and the Maurice Jarre soundtrack slays. Advantageous This 2015 flick sort of slipped under the radar in theaters, but thankfully Netflix is giving it a second chance at finding an audience. Jennifer Phang’s debut feature is set in the near future, where the technology to transfer your consciousness into a new body has just reached the human trial stage. The protagonist, Gwen, signs up for the procedure because she’s not capable of providing for her daughter, but needless to say science isn’t perfect and “Gwen 2.0” has some pieces missing. Advantageous is a clear-headed and chilly look at a future where the body is as disposable as anything else, and it’s well worth your time. Hard To Be A God One of the coolest things about Netflix’s sometimes schizophrenic selection is the offbeat foreign films that sneak through. Aleksei German’s 2013 Hard To Be A God is a great example. When a group of scientists travel to an Earth-like planet that is technologically centuries behind our own, one is chosen to infiltrate their society and help them progress forward. You can probably guess how well that turns out. Hard To Be A God is dark, deranged and uniquely Russian, well worth a look for a different view of the universe. Upstream Color Recent changes have knocked a bunch of flicks off this list, but they just made room for Shane Carruth’s brilliant follow-up to Primer. Where that movie twisted brains, Upstream Color does the same for hearts, telling the tale of a couple who are, without their knowledge, infected with a fictional parasite that passes from humans, to pigs, and finally to flowers. It’s a deeply affecting meditation on how much of us is “us” and how much is the horde of bacteria, viruses and other stuff that we carry around. One of the most ambitious and invigorating sci-fi films of the last decade. Galaxy Quest It took a while, but in 2016 Galaxy Quest is finally getting the recognition it deserves. When the cast members of a cancelled sci-fi TV show are mistaken for actual space explorers by a desperate alien race, things spin wildly out of control. What could be just a Spaceballs-esque farce brings an unexpected amount of emotional depth to the table? Great performances, including the late Alan Rickman, put it on the list. Apparently, there’s a darker, R-rated cut out there somewhere that nobody’s ever seen, but until that surfaces this version is more than fine. ARQ The first made-for-Netflix film to hit this list, ARQ is a curvy time-travel oddity that is perfect for watching at home so you can rewind if you get confused. The movie stars Robbie Amell as a dude who starts his day over every time he dies, but gets to carry along the memories. Thank the titular ARQ device of the title, a perpetual energy machine that does the same for time. Bad guys are trying to get it, so we get a sort of action-packed Groundhog Day with some fun twists. The writer/director is a veteran of Orphan Black, and that show’s fun messing with sci-fi tropes is present. It’s not an all-time classic but definitely worth a watch. Project X Netflix Streaming is starting to pick up a variety of obscure 70s and 80s studio flicks that ran under the radar for a while but are still good watching. Case in point: 1987’s Project X, a Matthew Broderick vehicle about a chimp being trained to fly jets for the military and the friends who try and free him. In the age of automated drone warfare, putting a primate in the cockpit seems pretty absurd, but the Cold War hysteria is just as relevant as ever. This is a solid flick with a good heart that is definitely well worth watching. Removed From Netflix Sadly, movies don’t stay streaming forever, and every month the selection on Netflix changes. When a movie gets taken off of the service, we’ll put it down here and let you know where else you can get it. RoboCop Paul Verhoeven’s dystopian 1987 classic is one of the most unflinchingly steel-eyed looks at the future of militarized policing, and it’s even more relevant in our modern age of drones blowing up snipers. RoboCop, if you’ve been living under a rock, is the story of Alex Murphy, a devoted Detroit cop who gets the majority of his body blown away in a shootout. He’s transformed into a seemingly emotionless cyborg and put back on the streets to set things right. Let’s not talk about the 2014 remake. Buy on DVD or Blu-Ray Stream on Amazon Video Terminator 2: Judgement Day James Cameron broke all the rules making the sequel to his time-traveling robot murder movie, and in doing so, he created one of the most iconic sci-fi films of the 90s. T2 brings Arnold Schwarzenegger back, but as the hero this time, tasked with protecting John Connor from a morphing liquid metal killing machine. Great performances, unforgettable action scenes and the best nuclear apocalypse ever captured on camera make this one an all-time classic. Buy on DVD or Blu-Ray Stream on Amazon Video The Fifth Element Luc Besson’s sci-fi fantasia is pretty much absurd from beginning to end, but it’s also visually delicious and a hell of a lot of fun. Bruce Willis stars in this 1997 flick as a taxi driver who meets a mysterious woman who just happens to be the key to preventing the extinction of all life in the universe. An incredible performance by Gary Oldman as Jean-Baptiste Emanuel Zorg, one of the best screen-chewing villains of all time, is more than enough reason to watch. Buy on DVD or Blu-Ray Stream on Amazon Video Back To The Future One of the most beloved sci-fi franchises of the 80s, all three Back to the Future movies were on Netflix until October of 2016. It’s absurd that we’d have to recount the plot of these to you, a human being with the Internet, but here we go: ordinary teen Marty McFly gets zapped into the past courtesy an electrified DeLorean and must absolutely not bone down with his mother to save the timestream as we know it. Fast-paced and funny with a career-making Crispin Glover performance, the first flick is the best but the sequel’s pretty solid too. The third one (set in the Wild West)? You can skip it. Buy on DVD or Blu-Ray Stream on Amazon Video The Running Man Arnold Schwarzenegger’s late-80s, early-90s run of movies is pretty unimpeachable, and one of our personal favorites is 87’s The Running Man, an alternately grisly and ridiculous spoof where he gets dropped into a murderous game show and has to fend for his life. Jesse “The Body” Ventura is awesome as “Captain Freedom,” and the other “stalkers” are fun as hell. Long-time game show host Richard Dawson shines in the role of the villainous Killian. In the era of increasingly lurid reality TV, this movie seems more accurate than ever. Buy on DVD or Blu-Ray Stream on Amazon Video E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial Steven Spielberg’s 1982 megahit is one of the most iconic sci-fi movies of all time. When a short, weird-looking alien is stranded on Earth, a group of kids help him find his way home. That’s a grotesque oversimplification, of course, but the plot isn’t what makes E.T. a classic. It’s the great performances, subtle and effective effects work, and attention to exactly what makes kids different from adults – something so many 80s movies mastered and seems to be nearly lost today. This is a prime feel-good movie that will fill you with nostalgia for an era of sci-fi gone by. Buy on DVD or Blu-Ray Stream on Amazon Video Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow Kerry Conran’s 2004 adventure was unusual when it premiered – live actors over CGI backgrounds, with no real sets? Obviously Hollywood caught up with him in the last decade or so, but Sky Captain is still worth a watch. The plot is an overheated mess, but that’s part of the charm, and the setting – an alternate-universe 1939 where mad scientists run amok and flying robots attack New York – is brilliant. This movie is just good clean fun of a kind that we don’t get enough of anymore. Oh, and it has Angelina Jolie in an eyepatch and a skin-tight leather outfit. Buy on DVD or Blu-Ray Stream on Amazon Video Equilibrium Kurt Wimmer’s 2002 flick was pretty much overshadowed by the much more successful Matrix movies, but a decade and a half later it holds up really well. Christian Bale plays a law enforcement officer in a society where emotions are forbidden and all citizens take a daily mood stabilizer. When he accidentally goes a day without his dose, his inner humanity awakens and leads him into conflict with the totalitarian state that rules everything. The special martial art invented for the movie – “gun kata,” where you master different stances for shooting and avoiding bullets – is both silly and sort of cool at the same time. Buy on DVD or Blu-Ray Stream on Amazon Video Star Trek: First Contact None of the Original Series Trek movies are on Netflix, but the Next Generation ones are. The best of them is easily First Contact, which hearkens back to Star Trek IV with a tale of the Enterprise’s crew traveling back in time. It’s not to save whales, though – the mission now is to prevent the Borg collective from changing the timeline themselves. Most of the action takes place on the day of Earth’s first contact with the Vulcans, the moment that created the Federation. Great performances, stirring action set pieces, and the introduction of Alice Krige as the Borg Queen make this one well worth your time.

Meet Joy who loves to  explore places and meet people  to give her an opportunity to learn from other cultures and characters.  What’s inside your bag? My bag contains [my] make up kit, hand lotion and hand sanitizer aside from my other personal belongings like wallet and phone. Nothing beats clean hands! I guess a bag must basically contain things that are useful for our daily activities.  What electronic gadgets are you currently using? For my laptop I am using a Macbook and an iPhone for my phone. It’s a fact that Apple products have always have the good quality and more advanced.  What’s inside your closet? Mostly my dresses from different collections are the major stuff inside my closet. I like glamour office attires, which I can also wear for evening events. I am also into shoes and handbags which occupy the most space in my closet. What is your style of clothing? Talking about my style cannot be defined in one corner. We have to be flexible. For me, it depends on the weather and occasion. Living in Dubai you can see me with fit clothes during summer and you can see me with fur during winter and sportswear every morning as I hit the gym or if I am just at home spending my time painting and  when I am with my music,  I  just merely wear my rugged clothes. What clothing brands do you think closely fit your sense of fashion?  I don’t really have a clothing brand in particular, when I shop, I visit every store and find something that fits my body type. My principle is this: If it looks good on you, buy it! No matter what brand it is, as I shop depending on what makes me look good not just the hype.  That would help you boost confidence.  What is your favorite perfume?  Chloé Eu du Parfum, it has a fresh powdery floral scent which makes me feel happy and boost my self-esteem and femininity. What is your favorite brand of shoes?  I both like Louboutin and Valentino.  I invest in a pair of good quality shoes as those brands produce comfortable shoes, more durable and they last longer especially [since] I always love to wear heels so I need to have a good quality pair of shoes. Are you a shopaholic?  Yes, I was before to be honest, but when I started earning from my own sweat, I intended not to, but I treat myself once in a while. We all have to admit that buying something new (new car, new dress, new shoes, new bags) makes us feel great but it’s only passive. For as long as you are not spending beyond your budget, then that’s totally fine!  What inspires or influences you to buy an item? I normally buy stuff for my basic needs or replacing old items but if I see great deals on the stores, I don’t want to miss the opportunity!              What brands do you trust for your skin care? I use SK-II and Shiseido for my face. I am very careful when buying products for my skin especially since I have acne prone skin. That’s why these two brands stand out for me. I also use Nivea shower gel and Nivea Lotion ever since. What is a Branded Pinoy for you? Branded Pinoy for me is someone who has a positive outlook in life. Our brains are wired to find things we are looking for. If you are always cynical or waiting for things to go wrong, then your life will reflect that. On the other hand, having a positive outlook in life will bring you joy and provide you with inspiration when you least expect it.  Facebook Comments Website Comments free pron March 6th, 2017 Reply HL5bYg Pretty!

Greg Abbott urging him not to pass discriminatory legislation. "As large employers in the state, we are gravely concerned that any such legislation would deeply tarnish Texas' reputation as open and friendly to businesses and families," the CEOs wrote Abbott in a letter dated May 27. "Our ability to attract, recruit and retain top talent, encourage new business relocations, expansions and investment, and maintain our economic competitiveness would all be negatively affected.  "Discrimination is wrong and it has no place in Texas or anywhere in our country." In addition to Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Apple CEO Tim Cook, the letter was signed by Amazon CEO Jeff Wilke, IBM Chairman Ginni Rometty, Microsoft Corp. President Brad Smith and Google CEO Sundar Pichai. The leaders of Dell Technologies, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Cisco, Silicon Labs, Celanese Corp., GSD&M, Salesforce and Gearbox Software also signed the letter. Is 'bathroom bill' proof that business no longer drives the Texas Legislature? "We strongly urge you and the Texas Legislature not to further pursue legislation of this kind," they added. The letter, which has not been made public but was released to The Dallas Morning News, was sent just days before state lawmakers were scheduled to gavel out the 2017 regular legislative session. The year's most controversial and divisive issue has been a Senate proposal to block transgender Texans from using restrooms that match their gender identities.  Abbott has urged lawmakers to find a compromise on this issue before they're scheduled to go home on Tuesday, but the Republican leaders of the House and Senate have been at loggerheads over the issue for months.  Bathroom showdown: Legislative leaders square off over 'bathroom bill,' threaten special session The disagreement reached a head Friday, with House Speaker Joe Straus refusing to pass legislation he said could harm "some very vulnerable young Texans." Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who heads the Senate, then asked Abbott to make lawmakers stay until they passed a so-called bathroom bill. Abbott has been relatively silent on the details of what he'd like to see in the bill. Business groups have openly objected to this and other legislation that they say would hurt Texas' lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community, but the opposition has done little to thwart Patrick's efforts.

The deal, likely to be the last financing round before the company goes public, was put together by a number of cycling enthusiasts. The company is on a steep-growth curve: It has tripled annual revenue, to $170 million, in just a year, and has 100,000 paying subscribers. Noah Wintroub picked up the phone and cold-called Peloton Cycle founder and CEO John Foley. A vice-chairman at JPMorgan, Wintroub had ordered a Peloton Cycle indoor bike. Convinced that Foley had built a great product, he wanted to get to know the company better. "If you've used the product, you get it, innately," Wintroub told Business Insider. "It's like 'Oh my god, these guys are the Apple of fitness.'" Fast forward 18 months or so, and Peloton Cycle closed a $325 million financing round, with the likes of Wellington Management, Fidelity Investments, Kleiner Perkins, and Comcast NBCUniversal pouring money into the company. JPMorgan was sole placement agent for the offering. Wintroub worked on the deal with another cycling enthusiast, Eric Stein, who is head of North American investment banking at JPMorgan. The Series E financing round valued the company at around $1.25 billion, making it a unicorn. Peloton Cycle is built around indoor cycling from the home. It has 22 showrooms around the country, and two studios — a flagship in Manhattan and a studio in Chicago. Customers can choose from a variety of live classes and archived classes. The bike costs $1,995, and unlimited classes cost $39 a month. Some Business Insider employees have tried the bike. The company is vertically integrated, making its own hardware, producing a tablet computer and the bike it sits on, and software, with 75 software engineers in New York City. It produces 12 hours of live television content a day, and sells through its own retail stores. It also delivers its own bikes in some cities. “Peloton is a cultural phenomenon and has redefined what it means to build a connected experience disrupting multiple industries simultaneously: in home fitness, boutique class fitness and connected media devices," said Jon Callaghan, cofounder of True Ventures, another investor in the firm. The new funds will go towards upping the number of retail stores it has, toward 40 by the end of the year, according to Foley, and extending in-house delivery to 10 markets, up from three right now. It also plans to sign a lease on a 30,000 square foot space in Midtown or Downtown Manhattan in the next few months, and to turn it into a fitness facility. "We believe Peloton is the leader in a new business that has significant potential – Physical Interactive Media,” Mary Meeker, a partner at Kleiner Perkins, said in a statement. The $325 million fundraiser was bigger than expected and included the sale of both primary equity, or new shares, and existing shares. Foley said he didn't expect there to be another placement, but that that didn't mean an initial public offering was on the immediate horizon. "We're very well capitalized to have options over the next several quarters," he told Business Insider.

If you want to buy a new vehicle, you still have to schlep to a dealer, negotiate a price and sign a stack of documents before you drive away. With the notable exception of upstart Tesla Motors, which offers a completely online process, shoppers can start the buying process online, but ultimately they have to visit a dealership to close the purchase. One reason is that manufacturers who have franchised dealers — everyone except Tesla — cannot compete with their dealers by selling directly to consumers either online or through company-owned stores, like Tesla or companies such as Apple. That is the law in all 50 states, so buying from a dealership is the only avenue. Though some consumers clamor for an entirely online experience, the traditional trek to a dealership is still the easiest route. A substantial portion of car buyers rely heavily on the services dealers provide, such as accepting trade-ins, arranging financing and having a selection of vehicles in stock they can see and test drive. “Buying online is the path of least resistance” for a new-vehicle shopper who is not trading in a car and has good credit, so they are a cinch to get approved for a loan, said Mathew Desmond, head of the North American automotive consulting firm Capgemini. But most customers will have a trade-in or need to discuss financing, which isn’t well-integrated into manufacturer and dealer sites, Desmond said in a telephone interview. “Dealers use technology heavily, and they’re quite savvy, but when it comes to the challenge of integrating finance and insurance platforms for credit approval, for trade-ins and appraisals, and being sure that you have the right value for the vehicle, the integration of all those processes so that they work seamlessly for a great customer experience is a big challenge,” he said. All vehicle manufacturers and dealerships have internet sites, but there isn’t a seamless transition from shopping on a manufacturer’s site to actually buying a vehicle on a dealer’s site. A customer who starts building and buying a car on the manufacturer’s site might have to start over with the dealership. Chicago-area dealer Mark Scarpelli, chairman of the National Automobile Dealers Association, said dealers are adapting to the changing retail landscape and upgrading their online services. “We’re getting to the point where credit applications can be submitted online to a dealership, obviously a car can be picked out, the price can be talked about and somewhat negotiated either on the telephone, through email or a website. All those functions are evolving,” Scarpelli said. “We’re going with what the customer likes and dislikes. There’s a lot of people who say, ‘I’d love to be able to buy the car online, but I still want to negotiate’ or ‘I want to touch and feel that car, and I want to drive it.’ Some of those functions can never be replicated online,” he said, adding that many lenders still require borrowers to sign loan agreements in person at a dealership. A 2016 survey of U.S. consumers by Capgemini bears this out. Sixty percent said they were willing to buy a new car online, and 60 percent said they want to avoid sales pressure at a dealership. However, 88 percent said they want to see the vehicle or test-drive it, and 55 percent said they want to be able to negotiate the price — something they might not be able to do online. Tesla allows shoppers to build a vehicle with features they choose and place an order online and pick it up at a delivery center or have it delivered. Buyers also can purchase a vehicle out of inventory online or through a company-owned store. A brand called Lynk & Co that intends to launch in the U.S. in 2019 plans a similar approach of selling directly to consumers online and through company-owned stores. In comparison, Desmond said General Motors’ Shop-Click-Drive program is an example of where other manufacturers are with online purchases. Consumers can shop dealer inventories online, pick a car, and check prices and financing options online, but they have to go to a dealer to complete the transaction and get an actual trade-in value. GM launched Shop-Click-Drive in late 2013. A spokesman said about 72 percent of GM’s 4,300 dealers participate and the “new- and used-vehicle leads generated by the program approached the half-million mark in 2016.” He said he couldn’t be more specific. During that time, though, GM sold more than 9 million vehicles in the U.S., so it accounts for only a small portion of its total sales, indicating that a vast majority of consumers still do all of their vehicle purchases the old-fashioned way — by going straight to a dealership. But with consumers making so many other retail purchases digitally, Desmond said that will prod the auto industry to change its approach in the near future so that most or all of a vehicle purchase can be completed online. He believes that will happen through a partnership of manufacturers working with dealers — not the direct sales approach used by Tesla. Tesla skirts the laws against competing with franchise dealers because it has none (the company owns all Tesla stores). Desmond said other manufacturers don’t want to start wars with their dealers by trying to sell directly to consumers, but he says the current system needs to become more digitally oriented and seamless when manufacturers hand off customers to dealers. “I don’t believe there needs to be a replacement for dealers, but there could be more choices in addition to dealers or different types of experiences with dealers,” he said. “There seems to be a symbiotic relationship where the manufacturer produces the product and the franchised dealer network sells and services it. What it revolves around is customer choice, and the industry needs to provide more choice to customers to meet or exceed their expectations.” University of Michigan law professor Daniel Crane argues that the franchise laws that require manufacturers to sell through dealers have helped keep the auto industry in a 20th Century retail model that is inefficient and reduces choices for consumers. “With changing technology both in terms of the cars and in which customers are used to buying more products online, now is a moment when the old business model isn’t making as much sense as it once did,” Crane said of the franchise dealer system that has been in place more than 100 years. Auto companies should be allowed to choose their own way of selling cars, whether that is online, through stores they own or through dealers, like other businesses, Crane said. Crane said Tesla may have to use franchised dealers to expand its sales and service network — something that CEO Elon Musk has said could happen — and adopt a hybrid distribution model like Apple, which sells products through its own stores as well as other retailers. Conversely, he added, car companies should be free to try other ways to sell to consumers other than through dealers. “There are lots of different ways of doing distribution, and every seller has to figure the best way to get its product to market. Having more choice and flexibility is going to incentivize more companies to experiment to find the right pitch for their products,” Crane said. “What you ordinarily want to let happen is a competitive process in the market to sort out what is the best distribution method.” ——— Pros and Cons of the Franchise Dealer Model Automakers have sold cars through franchised dealers for more than 100 years. Dealers say this system benefits consumers, but critics contend it is inefficient and adds cost. Here are some key pros and cons cited by advocates and critics: Pros Lower price: Competition among dealers lowers vehicles’ prices for consumers. Financial services: In addition to selling cars, dealers arrange financing and take trade-ins. Service: Consumers can get their vehicle serviced at the same place they bought it. This can foster a sense of community, trust. Advocacy: With warranty issues, dealerships often advocate on behalf of consumers with the manufacturer. Cons Limited competition: Vehicle manufacturers are required to sell only through franchised dealers, thereby limiting retail competition. Deterrent to innovation: State franchise laws inhibit retail innovations, such as internet sales. Limited choice: Some consumers would prefer to buy directly from the manufacturer and avoid dealers. Higher costs: Dealerships raise costs by adding another layer to the distribution system.

Douglas A. McIntyre 24/7 Wall St. May 28, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share Expectations for the sales of the iPhone 8 are extraordinarily high. There remain a number of questions among tech experts and Wall St. analysts who follow the company. Among them is whether the iPhone 8 launches in September or later. Even with a delayed release, the forecast for fourth quarter sales is, in some cases, close to 100 million. The iPhone 8 sales expectations depend largely on two things. The first is that the iPhone 7 is close to its one year birthday. Apple (AAPL) customers anticipate these anniversaries as the time when they can buy an upgrade. iPhone releases have been a year apart in the past. The second expectations is that the iPhone 8 may be a larger leap in technology and features than any model since the iPhone 5. The iPhone 5 was lighter than earlier versions. It was much thinner. It had an upgraded camera. It was the first model design by Apple's management after the death of Steven Jobs. ALSO READ: Cities Where You Don't Want to Get Sick There is always tremendous speculation about new iPhone features which begin months before release. For the iPhone 8, this might include a wireless charger. It may have an curved AMOLED display which allows for more picture sharpness and better contrast. It's "home button" may be gone. The speaker and camera may be behind the display screen. It may come in new sizes. It is impossible to predict which if any of these will wildly excite potential buyers. Apple's share price is near an all time high and its market cap at a record $800 billion. It cannot hold those numbers if the iPhone 8 is not a home run, both in the third calendar quarter when it will be released and more important the holiday quarter after. ALSO READ: 50 Least Powerful People in the World Cowen & Co.’s Timothy Arcuri was quoted by Barron's as saying that what is most important to investors is not when the iPhone 8 is released as much as whether Apple can sell 90 million iPhones in the last quarter of the year. Apple is the best performing Dow stock this year, and to hold that position of the balance of 2017, the iPhone 8 needs to eclipse expectations. For the last quarter of the year, the number needs to be 100 million.

Tech Apple Science Cars Samsung Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 E3 Memorial Day Deals     Emojis In Android GO Are Redesigned By Google Posted: May 28 2017, 10:39am CDT | by Ahmed Humayun, in News | Technology News     One of the most prominent signature changes that we see in each Android iteration is the redesigning of the standard emoji set. The trend started with the release of Android 4.4, Google has been constantly refining the emoticons of every next Android version, including Nougat. Don't Miss: Nintendo Switch with Neon Joy-Con in Stock Online The famous gumdrop-style emoji we have seen between Android 4.4 and Android 7.0 might presumably be changed now. Apple has been working designing and refining the tradition complete-round emoticons and they seem to be working well for the users. We received a news today that Google has redesigned the set of emoji that will be used in Android O (or Android Go), they are now back to the tradition full-circle style. There hasn’t been much changes, except that the gumdrop is now substituted with the graphical representation of an emoji inside a complete circle. It is probably for the better too, due to Facebook’s preference of circular emoticons, people are much used to and fond of the traditional design of emoticons. Google’s gumdrop design doesn’t have that many followers, at least not enough for Google to keep them in Android O, as we can see. This story may contain affiliate links.

Mohamed Al Zarooni, director of TRA’s Policy and Programs department According to TRA, users may fall victim to criminal software, phishing software, and malware that clone games. Furthermore, the TRA also warned against the illegal download of these kinds of games as illegal software and applications can cause damage to the operating system of smart phones, or be used for spying on its users. Pokemon Go has not yet been made available in app stores both in Apple and Android in the UAE, but can be downloaded through third-party applications. The TRA called on all game fans to wait until the game applications are officially available across official application stores. Aside from privacy issues, TRA also warned against falling prey to criminals as hackers may spy on users, and know when they are in isolated places—giving them the opportunity to rob users of their possessions, or cause them harm. “ . . . The TRA is warning all smart mobile and device users against using these applications in sensitive private places to ensure that their privacy and safety is secure,” Al Zarooni said. For his part, Adel Al Muhairi, manager of TRA’s National Computer Emergency Response Team, said: “The engrossment of game users into these games could possibly lead them to unknown places where unlawful criminals could be waiting for them. These games could also cause injury if used while driving or walking.” Al Muhairi said virtual reality technology also offers beneficial features and advantages, but only if used properly. “ . . . if it is not used correctly, it could have negative repercussions,” he said. Al Muhairi called on parents to join their children in discovering these new tech games to learn more about them so they can evaluate the dangers. He also asked to avoid using the camera options for these games, especially while at home. He encouraged parents to decide on what games are appropriate for the age groups of their children. The TRA said that it is currently studying all related effects, dangers, exploitations on society, when it comes to these games and applications. Recent news from around the world have reported about a number of armed robberies carried out because of the geo-positioning features in these games. Warning to Filipino Pokemon hunters Meanwhile, an official at the Philippine Embassy in Abu Dhabi warned all Filipinos in the emirates who are into the virtual world of Pokemon. “. . . be careful not to trespass in military camps, or government installations, as well as mosques while playing the game . . . We, here at the Philippine Embassy, reiterate the warning issued by the UAE’s Telecommunications Regulatory Authority cautioning all smart mobile and device users that online games, which request geographical locations, could be used against them for criminal activities,” Vice Consul Rowena Daquipil said. The Philippine Consulate General in Dubai also issued its advice to Filipino Pokemon hunters. “Personal safety is as important as personal leisure,” Consul Ferdinand Flores said. “Keep in mind [the] cultural sensitivities when taking photos near women and children, especially Emiratis,” Daquipil added. Pokemon Go craze In an informal survey conducted by Kabayan Weekly last week, two in every 10 Filipino players admitted that they are addicted to the game. One of the respondents who rated himself as Pokemon Go addict, Galiver Salina said he has been a fan of Pokemon since he was a young boy. Galiver, a sales representative working in a gadget store in Dubai, rated himself eight when asked about his addiction to the game. He was asked the question: “On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the most, how would you rate your Pokemon Go addiction?” A private nurse in Abu Dhabi, Mary Margarete Serrano, admitted that she is also addicted to the game. When asked about how long she plays everyday, she said 12 hours. “Last night (Saturday, July 16), I walked at Mangrove Place, from gate tower one at 1 a.m., and just kept on running and chasing Pokemons on the streets,” she said. Another self-confessed Pokemon Go addict, Patrick Valencia said he consumes up to four hours everyday playing the game. “. . . Standby sa Pokestop, tapos ikot-ikot lang sa area. Well, it’s my favorite childhood cartoon and it excites me to discover new places I’ve never been before, and anyway, it’s a good walking exercise,” he said. A Sharjah-based Filipina, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said she once had to cross the pedestrian lane on a red light just to catch a Pokemon. She, too, avowed that she is a Pokemon Go addict. “It was a Charizard [imaginary monster], so I really have to cross the street. I didn’t mind the heat. Marhay ta wara mga police duman sa area na ito (good thing there’s no cop in the area),” she said in Bicol dialect. She said she is aware of the repercussion of the app, but stressed that “snagging a rare Pokémon in Pokémon Go is the reason that keeps me exploring and looking for new areas to reach.” With reports from Jekah Carillo and Ryan Thomas Namia Facebook Comments Website Comments Owen Hudson May 16th, 2017 Reply Awesome blog!

Anytime. Anywhere. Build Apps 5x Faster For Half the Cost Enterprise Cloud Computing On Force.com Serena Williams Accepts a New Challenge, This One in Silicon Valley By Michael Liedtke PUBLISHED: MAY 28 2017 Tennis star Serena Williams has 39 Grand Slam titles, four Olympic medals, major endorsement deals and her own line of clothing and accessories. Now she is embarking on a new mission: She says she wants to help tech companies diversify their workforces and solve one of the industry's most vexing problems. Williams, 35, will get her chance as she joins a Silicon Valley boardroom. Online poll-taking service SurveyMonkey announced Williams' appointment to its board on Wednesday, along with Intuit CEO Brad Smith. "I feel like diversity is something I speak to," Williams said in an interview with The Associated Press. "Change is always happening; change is always building. What is important to me is to be at the forefront of the change and to make it easier for the next person that comes behind me." Williams didn't offer specifics about her goals as a corporate director. She implied that her very presence can help push the company -- and, by extension, the industry as a whole -- in a more diverse direction. Individual board members don't usually exert great influence over the companies they oversee, although they are often compensated handsomely in cash and stock for their part-time work. SurveyMonkey, a private company, didn't say how much Williams will be compensated. Valley Diversity Silicon Valley's lack of diversity has become a recurring source of embarrassment in a region that has long sought to position itself as an egalitarian place that doesn't favor one gender, ethnicity or race over another. Yet that philosophy hasn't been reflected in high-tech workforces , despite the efforts of companies such as Google, Apple and Facebook to fix the problem. Williams has been hanging around Silicon Valley more frequently now that she is engaged to high-tech entrepreneur, Alexis Ohanian, the co-founder of the online forum Reddit. Like many other African-Americans, she says she's disappointed that the vast majority of high-paying technology jobs are filled by white and Asian men. At SurveyMonkey, which employs about 650 workers, only 27 percent of technology jobs are filled by women. Just 14 percent of its total payroll consists of African-Americans, Latinos or people identifying themselves with at least two races, according to numbers the company provided to the AP. What She Can Do Williams' appointment is part of the solution, according to SurveyMonkey CEO Zander Lurie. "My focus is to bring in change agents around the table who can open our eyes," he said. Diversity advocates say women and minorities add value to corporate boards -- as well as companies' executive ranks -- by offering new perspectives and advocating for a broader range of a company's stakeholders, whether that's customers, shareholders or employees. In a report on France's quota requirements for corporate boards, the business research group Conference Board found that the real value of adding women came from the fact that they were more likely to be outsiders. They were more likely to be foreigners, have expertise in more diverse business issues than men and more likely to have risen through the ranks outside traditional networks, such as elite universities. This, in itself, can "substantively" improve the collective decision-making of a board, according to the report. Stepping Stone Racism is something Williams confronted and overcame at an early age when she began playing a predominantly white sport. She grew up to become the top-ranked female tennis player in the world. Diversifying Silicon Valley isn't the only item on Williams' agenda. Like a lot of rich athletes, she is interested in becoming more involved in the business opportunities amid the high-tech boom in Silicon Valley. She says she is already exploring other opportunities in the area, but isn't ready to provide details yet. Her connection to SurveyMonkey came through her friendship with Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer and another member of SurveyMonkey's board. Sandberg's husband, Dave Goldberg, was SurveyMonkey's CEO before he died in 2015 while the couple was vacationing in Mexico. "I have been really interested in getting involved in Silicon Valley for years, so I have been kind of in the wading waters," Williams said. "Now, I am jumping into the deep end of the pool. When I do something, I go all out." © 2017 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media. All rights reserved. Image credit: iStock.

Diversity advocates say women and minorities add value to corporate boards -- as well as companies' executive ranks -- by offering new perspectives and advocating for a broader range of a company's stakeholders, whether that's customers, shareholders or employees. In a report on France's quota requirements for corporate boards, the business research group Conference Board found that the real value of adding women came from the fact that they were more likely to be outsiders. They were more likely to be foreigners, have expertise in more diverse business issues than men and more likely to have risen through the ranks outside traditional networks, such as elite universities. This, in itself, can "substantively" improve the collective decision-making of a board, according to the report. Stepping Stone Racism is something Williams confronted and overcame at an early age when she began playing a predominantly white sport. She grew up to become the top-ranked female tennis player in the world. Diversifying Silicon Valley isn't the only item on Williams' agenda. Like a lot of rich athletes, she is interested in becoming more involved in the business opportunities amid the high-tech boom in Silicon Valley. She says she is already exploring other opportunities in the area, but isn't ready to provide details yet. Her connection to SurveyMonkey came through her friendship with Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer and another member of SurveyMonkey's board. Sandberg's husband, Dave Goldberg, was SurveyMonkey's CEO before he died in 2015 while the couple was vacationing in Mexico. "I have been really interested in getting involved in Silicon Valley for years, so I have been kind of in the wading waters," Williams said. "Now, I am jumping into the deep end of the pool. When I do something, I go all out." © 2017 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media. All rights reserved. Image credit: iStock.

Home Apple News Apple Rumors iPhone iPad iPod Mac Apple TV Apple Watch About iOS News Share on Facebook This is how the impossible design of the iPhone 8 has come true According to multiple sources and after many contradictory speculations, finally, the integration of the Touch ID will be located behind the screen as we all wanted and will require a small frame for the front camera. In this way, we forget the sensor of traces in the back that so many complaints are generating in the Samsung Galaxy S8 by its lack of ergonomics and we take full advantage of the screen without borders, that nevertheless will still have a small edge for a frontal camera that Apple will take advantage of other features. That is, design and innovation will go hand in hand on the iPhone 8. In addition, the sources of leaks are reliable: the first comes from Weibo, a Chinese website that is a gold mine in terms of information. The second comes from Benjamin Gaskin, one of the most technological journalists on the planet and who has already given some exclusive environment to those of Cupertino. As you can see in the images, in the impressive almost borderless screen with OLED technology and the integrated Home button there will be a space where there will be permanent information that will be updated, such as time, date and signal strength. Of course, Apple is not a pioneer in this idea, since Sharp has anticipated integrating the same cut in his Aquos R Compact. Could the notifications be integrated? Probably not, because Apple plans a functional area or function area in the pure Touch Bar style of the MacBook Pro that will vary depending on the content of the screenfor example, appear the controls of the player when we are listening to music. It all sounds better and Apple seems to be taking advantage of these months of delay over the competition by polishing the mistakes of others and developing a truly impressive product.

We’re all familiar with the story: the hand swatting and general lack of physical contact, the sudden fall of Melania’s smile during the inauguration, the lack of chivalry on the part of the president as he often leaves Melania in his wake while meeting dignitaries, the apparent distance between the couple when they dance. So far, Melania Trump has consistently denied rumors about a strained relationship with her husband, but people close to the couple have painted a different picture of the marriage. Perhaps we have been a little spoiled with the incredibly warm, affectionate chemistry between the former First Couple Michelle and Barack Obama. They were always holding hands in public, exchanging loving smiles and speaking highly of one another whenever they appeared in public. Portraying a healthy, happy relationship has been a hallmark of the Presidency for decades. There is a sense that the First Family is required to present an image of a high-functioning, perfect American family. Even through difficult times — for example, the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal — presidential husband and wife teams have always been able to maintain a unified public image. It explains why the allegedly fraught relations between Melania and Donald is getting so much attention. When Mr. Trump exited his vehicle to greet the Obamas on the morning of inauguration day, he left Melania trailing behind him instead of waiting to escort her up the stairs. Then there was the now-famous moment when Trump turned to Melania and said something which made her smile fall instantly. The allegedly unusual behavior prompted social media users to start pro-Melania trends on Twitter, including #SaveMelania and #SadMelania. Since the inauguration day, a few more incidents have occurred, increasing the speculation about possible tensions between Trump and Melania. On Sunday, May 21, Claude Taylor, who is a former staff member in Clinton’s White House administration, took to Twitter to divulge information he had purportedly received from a highly respected journalist that Melania and Trump had signed, but not filed, divorce papers before last year’s election. I was just told by MSM member that Donald and Melania's divorce papers were signed prior to election and settlement agreed to. Then he won. — Claude Taylor (@TrueFactsStated) May 22, 2017 Of course, this is merely an allegation and it has not been independently verified. Nevertheless, the tweet got a huge reaction from Twitter users that led to an informal inquisition. One such user wanted to where the papers had been filed, but Taylor was quick to reaffirm that the supposed documents have not yet been filed. @Nyxiedust Papers signed. Not filed. That's all I was told. — Claude Taylor (@TrueFactsStated) May 22, 2017 Others users weren’t buying the allegation so easily and demanded more proof. Taylor claimed that the reporter who provided him with the scoop was well-known. @JacquiUpNorth44 @Nyxiedust A reporter well known to many said this to me. If they were ready to go on the record with it they would have reported it themselves. — Claude Taylor (@TrueFactsStated) May 22, 2017 @JudyMcLarty @JJohnson2u My source is a well known reporter. Not household name level-but established and respected by peers. — Claude Taylor (@TrueFactsStated) May 22, 2017 After being pressed further by a skeptical user, Taylor mentioned that publications are loath to print stories before being absolutely confident that the information they received is one hundred percent legitimate and verifiable. @JacquiUpNorth44 @InDaZone Editors. You wouldn't believe the legal and editorial hoops MSM have to jump through before they print or air. — Claude Taylor (@TrueFactsStated) May 22, 2017 Donald Trump met Melania Knauss in 1998 at a high-profile fashion event in New York City. Melania was born in Yugoslavia in 1971. Her father is Austrian and her mother Slovenian. Melania became interested in fashion and decided to move to the Big Apple to try her hand at fashion design. At first, Melania supplemented her income by working in the modeling industry. She was the face of a watch brand, modeled lingerie and appeared in a Panasonic television advert. However, according to a report in the New York Post, According to a close friend, Melania was not able to survive on the money she was being paid and, as such, she was considering a return to her home country. “She ran into Donald just at the right time. She was just about out of money, at the end of her rope and about to move back to Eastern Europe.” That is when Melania met Donald Trump, the billionaire real estate mogul who was well-known in social circles and was also quickly gaining fame as the tough-guy who hired and fired contestants on The Apprentice. After a few years of dating, “The Donald” decided to propose to his new love with a $2 million diamond ring. Of course, she said yes. But what exactly was it that drew the Slovenian beauty to Trump? Melania told the New York Post’s Julia Ioffe that Donald Trump reminded her of her father, Viktor Knavs. Melania said her father “likes quality,” enjoys “good food,” and admires cars. Ana Jelančič, a friend of Melania’s family in Yugoslavia, said the Viktor is so charismatic that if “he goes into a bar, people pay attention.” She adds that “Viktor sucks the air out of a room,” and says of his relationship with Melania’s mother, Amalija, that “he is the strong one in the relationship.” According to the friend, “Amalija supports him. She is a wonderful mother and wife.” Viktor and Amalija Knavs, the parents of Melania Trump, disembark from Air Force One at the Palm Beach International Airport. [Image by Lynne Sladky/AP Images] Another similarity between Viktor and Trump is that Melania’s father is a “hard working” salesman with interest in real estate and high business acumen. Apparently, Melania does not dispute the similarities between the two most important men in her life. “They’re both very smart and very capable. They grew up in totally different environments, but they have the same values, they have the same tradition. I myself am similar to my husband. Do you understand what I mean? So is my dad; he is a family man, he has tradition, he was hardworking. So is my husband.” A childhood friend a Melania’s, Vladimira Tomšič, says that she values the traditional family nucleus, much like the relationship between her father and mother. Tomšič adds that this is “the secret of why he’s with her is her traditional values and the importance of family to her.” During an interview with Larry King Live in 2005, Larry asked Trump if he was looking forward to being a father with Melania. Trump responded by saying “there’s nothing like a good marriage and there’s nothing like having children.” Trump also said that Melania would be doing most of the childcare work because “I’m not going to be doing the diapers. I’m not going to be making the food. I may never even see the kids.” Trump also told Larry King that he’s not interested in working on a relationship, preferring to keep things simple. “I work very hard from early in the morning till late in the evening. I don’t want to go home and work at a relationship. I mean, that’s it. A relationship where you have to work at it, in my opinion, doesn’t work. So, maybe I’m wrong.” But what are the indicators that have led to allegations of Melania’s growing unhappiness in the relationship? Some have speculated that she is not too keen on the central role that politics now plays in her life. Melania once told Trump that “he really needs to make sure he knows he really wants to do it, because life changes.” Melania has also thus far been an evasive First Lady, spending most of her time in Trump Tower looking after their son, Barron Trump, while he continues to attend school there.

Bernstein/Getty Images] There are also some indications that Melania is growing weary of Trump’s comments about women, in general. After the Access Hollywood incident involving crude remarks shared between Trump and Billy Bush, Melania lightly admonished her husband. “The words my husband used are unacceptable and offensive to me. This does not represent the man I know. He has the heart and mind of a leader.” However, Melania also subtly defended Trump’s character by asking the public to “accept his apology, as I have, and focus on the important issues facing our nation in the world.” It was not the first time Trump had made disparaging comments about women and had often done the same to Melania. Trump has made a few appearances on Howard Stern’s radio show, and during one interview Stern asked him if he would still be able to love Melania if she “were in a terrible car accident, God forbid, and lost the use of her left arm, developed an oozing red splotch near her eye, and mangled her left foot.” Trump responded by asking if, in this scenario, Melania’s breasts would still look okay. After Stern said “yes,” Trump answered that, in that case, he’d stay with her “because that’s important.” During another conversation with Howard Stern, making a reference to his girlfriend Beth, Trump reminded Stern that “you said something a while ago about Beth that amazed me because it applies to Melania. You said you’ve never seen here do anything like, bad, in terms of her own personal.” “You said you’ve never heard her fart. Is that true? Is that amazing? In years, three and a half years.” Stern then told Trump that Beth has only “pooped four times in three years.” According to Trump, it was the same situation with Melania, adding that he had never seen her make “a doody” and that maybe “they save that for after marriage.” Trump, while referring to sexually transmitted diseases, also told Stern that dating women was like being in Vietnam during the war. “I’ve been so lucky in terms of that whole world. It is a dangerous world out there — it’s scary, like Vietnam. Sort of like the Vietnam era. It is my personal Vietnam. I feel like a great and very brave solider.” Also while on the show, Trump made derogatory remarks about Melania’s body during her pregnancy, even going as far as calling her a “monster.” “You know, they just blow up, right? Like a blimp — in the right places. In her case, the right places. I mean she really has become a monster — in all the right places. I mean monster in the most positive way. She has gotten very, very large — in all the right places.” @JStoddardYoung1 Hit image for a short clip of Melania & Donald Trump on the Howard Stern show. YouTube has more: pic.twitter.com/rGIFEkUTXa — RiotWomenn (@riotwomennn) November 6, 2016 According to a report by Vanity Fair, a friend of Trump once heard the president say that he only “agreed to the baby on the condition that Melania would get her body back.” The source added that Trump was “simply rude” to Melania. “There was no ‘How do you feel?’ No opening of doors, making sure she didn’t fall. Just ‘You wanted to have a baby.'” Michael D’Antonio, who is the author of The Truth About Trump, has previously told reporters that he witnessed Trump forcing Melania to “praise him.” “He begged her to praise him [to me] as a husband…. Literally, he said, ‘Tell him I’m a really good husband.’ She looked at him, and he repeated himself. And she said, ‘Yeah, he’s a really good husband.’ It was being dragged out of her.” As reported by the New York Times, Melania has broken up with Donald Trump before, many years ago. A former roommate of Melania’s, Matthew Atanianhe, purportedly said that “she had some trust issues with him at the beginning.” “She was telling me that she wouldn’t have it, he was back to his old ways. She kept her apartment to have her own space because of this.” While the couple was separated, Trump allegedly said that “Melania is an amazing woman, a terrific woman, a great woman, and she will be missed.” [Featured Image by Michael Bocchieri/Getty Images] Share 300 Tweet 0 Share 0 Share 0 Pin It 0 Contributor Pieter Howes Tags: Donald Trump, First Lady, melania trump, president Donald Trump August 7, 2014 Ugly Feminists Freak Out Over #FeministsAreUgly Hashtag August 7, 2014 Brooklyn Jogger Finds Apparent Skeleton Decked Out In Nets Gear Comments LATEST HEADLINES Hillary Clinton Recent Statement Suggest She Is The Actual Winner Of The 2016 Presidential Election?

Savills said that all of the cities on the list are: "at the top of global shopping lists for tech companies looking for space in which to locate." They created an interactive globe which highlights each city on the list and ranked them under five different categories: Business Environment, Tech Environment, Buzz and Wellness, Talent Pool and Real Estate costs.  Dublin came 12th out of a total of 22 cities, with Savill saying that: "Dublin offers a young, tech-savvy workforce and a host of big names including AirBnb, Apple and Facebook. "A business-friendly, low tax environment may have drawn big players to the city, but it is the city’s legendary social scene that cemented its position as a major global tech player." Business Environment When it came to Business Environment, which looks at things such as investment environment, business costs and start-up culture, Dublin was above the average.  The average GDP per capita was around €46,000, with Dublin coming in at around €58,000. Dublin was below the average when it came to the amount of annual passengers across city airports. The average for the other tech cities was 48 million passengers, with Dublin having 25 million annual passengers.  Tech Environment Dublin was slightly below the average for broadband download speeds, with the average in tech cities being 19.4 megabytes per second (mbps) and Dublin being 17.4 mpbs. Dublin was also below the average when it came to start-ups per 1000 people, with Dublin sitting at 1.1 and the average being 2.3. Buzz and Wellness Possibly the most important metric was the price of a flat white coffee.

Give the Supreme Court credit for taking a big step last week to put them in their place. The court, in a unanimous decision, ruled that patent lawsuits can only be filed in a court where a defendant is incorporated or has a “regular and established place of business.” The ruling should mean the end of patent trolls shopping for plaintiff-friendly district courts across the nation that have a reputation for handing trolls a better chance of winning. Related Articles May 25, 2017 Patent trolls take hit in Supreme Court ruling May 26, 2017 In town that patent trolls built, Supreme Court ruling is big news February 22, 2017 High court ruling limits international reach of patent laws It’s a major win for the tech industry that should be celebrated throughout Silicon Valley. Patent trolls are the bane of tech companies everywhere. They acquire patents, usually from small firms or inventors, and then look for companies they can aggressively sue for infringing them. The shakedown artists costs the tech industry an estimated $30 billion every year. And it’s not just the tech giants — Apple, Oracle, Facebook and Google — that suffer. Two eye-popping studies show the impact on the startup companies that are the future of the tech industry. A 2013 study by Robin Feldman, a professor of innovation law at the University of California’s Hastings College of the Law, found that one in three  startup companies and 70 percent of venture capitalists are targeted by patent trolls. A 2014 study by researchers at the University of Texas and Harvard University found that firms that were forced to pay patent trolls through a lawsuit or out-of-court settlement spent an average of $211 million less on research and development than the firms who won lawsuits against patent trolls. It’s no big surprise, since the average cost of fighting a patent challenge is about $500,000. For the better part of the last two decades, patent trolls’ practice of shopping for “friendly” federal courthouses has gone beyond absurd.  The town of Marshall, Texas, with a population of just over 20,000 near the Louisiana border, routinely handles more than one-quarter of the patent challenge cases every year. The situation would be comical if it wasn’t so costly and detrimental to tech firms. Samsung, for example, went so far in an effort to build goodwill in Marshall — and with potential jurors — that it sponsored an outdoor ice skating rink next to the courthouse. Attorneys for practically every tech titan in the United States know the restaurants and where they can obtain office accessibility in Marshall at a moment’s notice. The Supreme Court ruling should change all that. The case, TC Heartland vs. Kraft Foods, interestingly enough, didn’t involve a tech firm. Kraft sued TC Heartland, charging that it had stolen a liquid drink patent. TC Heartland, which is based in Indiana, objected to having the case tried in Delaware, and the Supreme Court agreed that was unreasonable. The ruling won’t exterminate patent trolls altogether, but it’s a good step toward putting them in their rightful place.

Currency Watch: May 17 - Wall Street Journal (Saumya Vaishampayan): "China's central bank is guiding the currency higher, but the country's investors seem unconvinced. The People's Bank of China on Wednesday fixed the yuan at 6.8635 per dollar, the strongest since Feb. 17, only to have it weaken to 6.88 within minutes... The gap between the central bank's fix and where the currency then trades in the onshore market has widened in recent days. Wednesday's discount was the largest since January. Such a gap 'suggests that the onshore market is still not fully convinced that the Chinese yuan will remain strong,' said Irene Cheung, a senior strategist for Asia at ANZ in Singapore..."

Corn added 0.4% (up 5.8%). Trump Administration Watch: May 19 - Bloomberg (Justine Sink): "Donald Trump won the presidency on the promise he'd drain the swamp. This week, the swamp struck back. The naming Wednesday of former FBI Director Robert Mueller as special counsel to investigate the Russian government's meddling in the U.S. election, including ties to Trump's campaign, abruptly shifted the balance of power in Washington. The city's permanent political class forcefully reasserted itself against an antagonistic president determined to bring them to heel. The Russia investigation will cast a pall over Trump's first term, with Mueller free to pursue the facts where they lead and little urgency to get there." May 18 - Reuters (Julia Edwards Ainsley and Steve Holland): "The U.S. Justice Department, in the face of rising pressure from Capitol Hill, named former FBI chief Robert Mueller... as special counsel to investigate alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election and possible collusion between President Donald Trump's campaign and Moscow. The move followed a week in which the White House was thrown into uproar after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey... Trump, whose anger over the allegations has grown in recent weeks, took the news calmly and used it to rally his team to unite, move on and refocus on his stalled agenda, a senior White House official said. 'We are all in this together,' Trump told his team..." May 13 - Reuters (David Lawder): "U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said... that United States reserves the right to be protectionist on trade, but noted that his international counterparts are growing more comfortable with the Trump administration's economic agenda. 'We do not want to be protectionist but we reserve our right to be protectionist to the extent that we believe trade is not free and fair,' Mnuchin told a news conference at the end of a meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Seven industrial democracies. 'Our approach is for more balanced trade, and people have heard that... And as I say, people are more comfortable today, now that they've had the opportunity to spend time with me and listen to the president and hear our economic message.'" May 15 - Bloomberg (David Goodman and Alessandra Migliaccio): "Group-of-Seven ministers slowly coming to terms with the reality of Donald Trump's administration are about to leave the heavy lifting to their bosses. Finance chiefs in Italy at the weekend spoke of an improving relationship with their U.S. counterpart Steven Mnuchin, in a contrast to previous encounters. But with their gathering in Bari cementing rather than mending disagreements on free trade, the risk is that the diplomatic truce they achieved unwinds when Trump himself meets with G-7 leaders on the island of Sicily later this month." May 16 - Bloomberg (Joe Light): "A top Treasury Department official said the Trump administration wants to boost the role of private capital in the mortgage market, a longstanding Washington goal that has largely befuddled policy makers since the 2008 financial crisis. Transferring risk away from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is 'core' to U.S. housing policy, Craig Phillips, a counselor to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, said... Without outlining any specific plans, Phillips said a central goal is increasing the amount of private loans in the market that lack government backing." China Bubble Watch: May 15 - Bloomberg: "The ferocity of China's bond rout is surprising some of the market's top observers. The yield on sovereign debt due in a decade surged to a two-year-high of 3.7% last week, wrong-footing analysts from Citic Securities Co. and Haitong Securities Co. -- the country's two biggest brokerages -- who had in April predicted a maximum level of 3.6% in the near term. The tumble comes amid intensifying efforts to crack down on excessive borrowing... 'No one knows what kind of indicator would suggest the campaign is over, and no one knows how long this process will last,' said Shan Kun, head of China markets strategy at BNP Paribas (China)... 'When the market is so pessimistic, investors are trading based on expectations, and declines can be illogical.'" May 18 - Bloomberg: "China's anti-leverage campaign is causing a distortion that hasn't happened in the nation's $9 trillion bond market in at least a decade. The five-year sovereign yield is now higher than that on debt due in a decade, the first time the curve has inverted for the tenor in data going back to 2006. This is due mainly to a surge in the shorter-term yield because of a deleveraging campaign, and a limited advance in the 10-year cost as economic growth concerns raise demand for safety... 'It's hard to say where the funding costs will be able to stabilize, so that's curbing demand for the short-end of the curve," said Wu Sijie, a Shanghai-based senior trader at China Merchants Bank Co. 'A liquid market has become the paramount consideration, as people want to escape as fast as they can in a selloff.'" May 16 - Reuters (Samuel Shen and Engen Tham): "China's banking regulator is tightening disclosure rules on lenders' wealth management products (WMP) as it tries to track risky lending practices in the shadow banking sector, the latest in a series of steps by Beijing aimed at defusing financial risks. The China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) said... it plans to launch 46 new or revised rules this year, part of which targets risks related to shadowbanking activities Authorities are trying to better regulate 30 trillion yuan ($4.35 trillion) of WMPs, much of it sitting off-balance sheet in the shadowbanking sector. The WMPS have been used to channel deposits into risky investments, often via many layers of asset management schemes to skirt lending and capital rules. The CBRC will now require that banks report the underlying assets and liabilities of their WMPs, as well as all layers of investment schemes, on a weekly basis." May 16 - Wall Street Journal (Shen Hong): "China's central bank made its biggest one-day cash injection into the country's fragile financial markets in nearly four months Tuesday, a fresh sign that Beijing is trying to mitigate the damage to investor confidence inflicted by its recent campaign to tamp down speculative investing fueled by debt. The People's Bank of China pumped a net 170 billion yuan ($24.7bn) into the financial system... The huge provision of cash follows comments from Chinese officials in recent days that suggest they are concerned that recent moves to tighten market regulation have caused too much disruption." May 17 - Financial Times (Gabriel Wildau and Nan Ma): "One of China's largest insurers has warned of mass defaults and social unrest unless the regulator lifts a ban on its issuance of new products, the latest sign of stress in the industry caused by a crackdown on financial risk. In a letter to China's insurance regulator seen by the Financial Times, Foresea Life Insurance warns that the company expects Rmb60bn ($8.7bn) in redemptions this year and might be unable to meet payouts unless it is able to sell new products. In December, the China Insurance Regulatory Commission banned Foresea for three months from applying to sell new products... In the letter dated April 28, Foresea asks the CIRC to resume new product approvals 'in order to avoid inciting mass incidents by clients and localised and systemic risks, producing greater damage to the industry'... Foresea is a unit of Baoneng Group, a property and financial conglomerate... Baoneng has used the sale of so-called 'universal insurance' products to finance its stake in Vanke and other listed companies. Such policies are, essentially, investment vehicles offering high yields and guaranteed payouts on maturities. Distributed through banks, they bear little resemblance to traditional insurance..." May 14 - Wall Street Journal (Chuin-Wei Yap): "The past two months have been tumultuous for Chinese lenders as a new banking czar has unleashed a blizzard of new directives, uncovered a fraud scandal and issued heavy fines. Since his appointment to head the China Banking Regulatory Commission in February, Guo Shuqing has become a central figure in Beijing's crackdown on risk... The 60-year-old Mr. Guo is navigating narrow straits: He has to tame a freewheeling industry without killing a tentative recovery in bank profits or causing too much disruption. President Xi Jinping has stressed the need for a stable financial sector ahead of a major Communist Party leadership shuffle this fall. On Friday, the CBRC tried to reassure investors that it was aware of the threat of overregulation and emphasized the campaign's value in reducing risk long term. 'We're hoping now to avoid risks that have resulted from the regulations to resolve risk,' said Xiao Yuanqi, a CBRC department head." May 16 - Reuters (Elias Glenn): "China's growth is set for its weakest patch since the global financial crisis as authorities pull back on the stimulus that helped the economy get off to an unexpectedly strong start this year, and keep funds tight to deter risky lending... Massive debt - standing at nearly 300% of GDP - and serious budgetary imbalances mean Beijing can't carry on pump priming. The brakes went on in April, when annual growth in fiscal spending dropped to 3.8% from 21% the first quarter. And worries about speculative bubbles have forced the central bank to tighten short term liquidity, while trying to keep medium term funding available for investment." May 17 - Bloomberg: "China home-price growth eased last month after authorities imposed stricter restrictions on property purchases. New-home prices... gained last month in 58 of the 70 cities tracked by the government, compared with 62 in March, the National Bureau of Statistics said... Prices fell in eight cities and were unchanged in four... Chinese authorities stepped up curbs in a string of large cities last month to rein in prices, following a resurgence in demand the previous two months as buyers tried to get in ahead of further restrictions." Europe Watch: May 12 - Wall Street Journal (Giovanni Legorano and Manuela Mesco): "Europe's establishment breathed a sigh of relief after the pro-European Union centrist Emmanuel Macron was elected French president this week. But another populist storm is brewing in Italy, where the euroskeptic 5 Star Movement has remained strong. Fueled by discontent with slow growth, high unemployment and disillusionment with mainstream politicians, 5-Star has won local elections in Rome, Turin and elsewhere, partly on the strength of its leaders' call for a referendum on Italy's use of the European single currency. Pollsters say about 30% of Italian voters support the movement founded by comedian Beppe Grillo, a level of popularity that has stood firm despite a series of high-profile stumbles..." May 17 - Bloomberg (Piotr Skolimowski): "The European Central Bank is trying to work out a key question about the road to policy normalization: what's the speed limit? Three weeks before their next policy decision, the terms of debate between the ECB's 25 Governing Council members over announcing and implementing an exit from unconventional stimulus have coalesced around the pace. In one camp are those who want to move slowly. In the opposite camp: those who want to move extremely slowly. The June 8 meeting in Tallinn is in the sights of investors and economists seeking a signal that the euro area has recovered enough for the ECB to at least hold its first formal talks on what a policy reversal might look like." May 18 - Bloomberg (Carolynn Look and Alessandro Speciale): "European Central Bank policy makers pointed to June to revisit their policy stance after differing on how much the region's economic outlook had improved. At the next policy meeting on June 8, new staff projections and data will put officials 'in a better position to take stock and reassess the sustainability of the recovery and the outlook for inflation,' an account of the Governing Council's April 26-27 meeting showed... 'Some members considered that the risks to real gross domestic product could now be characterized as broadly balanced,' while 'other members maintained that downside risks to growth still prevailed,' the account showed." May 17 - Bloomberg (Maria Tadeo and Ainhoa Goyeneche): "Spain's government debt pile rose for the fourth consecutive month in March, once again climbing above 100% of gross domestic product... Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy's government has been struggling with a debt-to-GDP ratio hovering around 100% since mid-2014 even as Spain leads the recovery in the euro area." Global Bubble Watch: May 13 - New York Times (Jane Perlez and Yufan Huang): "Along the jungle-covered mountains of Laos, squads of Chinese engineers are drilling hundreds of tunnels and bridges to support a 260-mile railway, a $6 billion project that will eventually connect eight Asian countries. Chinese money is building power plants in Pakistan to address chronic electricity shortages, part of an expected $46 billion worth of investment. Chinese planners are mapping out train lines from Budapest to Belgrade, Serbia, providing another artery for Chinese goods flowing into Europe through a Chinese-owned port in Greece. The massive infrastructure projects, along with hundreds of others across Asia, Africa and Europe, form the backbone of China's ambitious economic and geopolitical agenda... The initiative, called 'One Belt, One Road,' looms on a scope and scale with little precedent in modern history, promising more than $1 trillion in infrastructure and spanning more than 60 countries." May 15 - Reuters (Shu Zhang and Matthew Miller): "Behind China's trillion-dollar effort to build a modern Silk Road is a lending program of unprecedented breadth, one that will help build ports, roads and rail links, but could also leave some banks and many countries with quite a hangover. At the heart of that splurge are China's two policy lenders, China Development Bank (CDB) and Export-Import Bank of China (EXIM), which have between them already provided $200 billion in loans throughout Asia, the Middle East and even Africa. They are due to extend at least $55 billion more... Thanks to cheaper funding, CDB and EXIM have helped to unblock what Chinese president Xi Jinping on Sunday called a 'prominent challenge' to the Silk Road: the funding bottleneck. But as the Belt and Road project grows, so do the risks to policy banks, commercial lenders and borrowers, all of whom are tangled in projects with questionable business logic, bankers and analysts say." Fixed Income Bubble Watch: May 14 - Wall Street Journal (Heather Gillers and Tom McGinty): "The losses from soured investments in Puerto Rico bonds are coming into focus for some of the world's biggest mutual funds, and it is a brutal reckoning. The total red ink for mutual funds that invested in debt issued by the troubled island commonwealth is as much as $5.4 billion over the past five years, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of mutual-fund holdings... Those losses... were tucked inside a wide range of funds..." May 14 - Financial Times (Fraser Lundie): "'The past is always triple-A. We can all remember what the past was. But if we try to make the future triple-A, we have no future. The future is always single-B.' Michael Milken, the 'Junk bond king', was not describing the asset class he created, but he could well have been. In hindsight, high-yield bonds have been one of the best performing asset classes on a risk-adjusted basis of any in the world, an asset class delivering equity-like rewards with half the volatility. Like all things too good to last, capital markets have come to chew the fat off this remarkable record... It is ironic that an asset class that has taken decades to rid itself of the unflattering 'junk' tag now finds itself in a state more likely to exhibit junk status than ever before." May 16 - Wall Street Journal (Min Zeng): "The U.S. bond market is sending a note of caution to the Federal Reserve, which is on track to raise interest rates in June. Hedge funds and money managers have built up the biggest net wagers since 2008 betting long-term Treasury yields will fall. At the same time, wagers betting on an increase in short-term interest rates are near the highest level since 1993. This divergence is happening at a time when the yield premium on the 10-year note relative to the two year has been shrinking." Federal Reserve Watch: May 17 - Bloomberg (Brian Chappatta): "The bond market is interpreting what could be the deepest crisis of Donald Trump's presidency as throwing the Federal Reserve off its path for interest-rate increases this year. The odds that the central bank raises its benchmark rate next month are about 60%, based on the current effective fed funds rate and the forward overnight index swap rate. That's down from 80% a week ago." May 15 - CNBC (Steve Liesman): "While Federal Reserve officials have said they plan to begin a process to normalize their balance sheet, the end result is likely to be a balance sheet that is anything but normal. Interviews with Fed officials, and public statements they've made suggest the Fed's new normalized balance sheet could end up being three times as large as it was before the financial crisis. And it could be bigger than that. The Fed has yet to announce a plan to run off its massive $4.4 trillion balance sheet, but market participants... expect the process to begin in January 2018, months sooner than previously forecast. Some Fed officials have made no secret of their intentions to announce a plan later this year to reduce the balance sheet." May 15 - Bloomberg (Liz McCormick and Alex Harris): "To appreciate just how important the Federal Reserve has been to the U.S. Treasury, consider this simple fact: It alone financed roughly 40% of America's budget deficit last year. So as Fed officials talk up the possibility of unwinding the central bank's crisis-era bond holdings later this year, figuring out what will happen when the U.S. loses its biggest source of funding has become a pressing concern. Of course, finding ready buyers in the Treasury market... has rarely been a problem. But with deficits poised to balloon, bond dealers are divided over which parts of the market will feel the most pain as the Fed pulls back and the Treasury ramps up debt issuance to fill those gaps." U.S. Bubble Watch: May 15 - Wall Street Journal (Laura Kusisto): "Home sales in the first quarter hit their fastest pace in a decade, a sign that rising prices and slightly higher mortgage rates haven't deterred home buyers from rushing into the market. Total existing-home sales climbed 1.4% in the quarter to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.62 million, the highest since the first quarter of 2007... The national median home price, meanwhile, jumped 6.9% from the same quarter a year earlier to $232,100, the sharpest price gain in nearly two years. Demand remains strong as millennials begin to enter the housing market in force." May 17 - CNBC (Diana Olick): "The number of homes for sale in America has been falling steadily for the past year, but the situation is apparently getting much worse as spring demand heats up. 'The inventory is reaching historic lows. It's never declined faster than it did last month. It's freaking us out — it's affecting our business; it's limiting our sales,' said Glenn Kelman, CEO of Seattle-based Redfin..." May 15 - Bloomberg (Patricia Laya): "More confidence among U.S. home builders this month shows the industry remains optimistic demand will keep growing in the face of rising property values, according to data... from the National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo. Builder sentiment rose to 70, the second-highest since 2005, from 68 in April..." May 16 - Reuters (Richard Leong): "The U.S. economy is forecast to expand at a 4.1% annualized pace in the second quarter following the release of April figures on housing starts and industrial output, the Atlanta Federal Reserve's GDP Now forecast model showed... Domestic factory production increased 1.0% last month for its biggest monthly gain in over three years, but housing starts unexpectedly fell 2.6%..." May 17 - Reuters (Jonathan Spicer): "Americans' debt level reached a record high this year, surpassing the peak touched just as the worst of the recession was taking hold in 2008, and marking a milestone for households that now lean less on mortgages and more on auto and student loans. Total U.S. household debt was $12.73 trillion at the end of the first quarter of 2017, up $473 billion from a year ago, according to a Federal Reserve Bank of New York survey... Total indebtedness is now 14% above the 2013 trough of household deleveraging brought on by the 2007-2009 financial crisis and Great Recession. The previous peak, in the third quarter of 2008, was $12.68 trillion, and the New York Fed stressed that the pull-back since then marked an 'aberration' from what had been a 63-year upward trend in household debt." May 18 - Bloomberg (Shahien Nasiripour): "Student debt has more than tripled as a share of total debt owed by U.S. households in less than 15 years.. Student loans made up just 3.3% of total household debt in 2003, for a sum of $240.7 billion, according to estimates... by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. That sum is now about $1.3 trillion, or about 10.6% of all U.S. household debt. The jump reflects higher tuition and campus-related costs, more people seeking higher education..., and declines in state appropriations to public colleges and federal grants to students relative to rising college costs. One in six American adults, or 44 million people, has a student loan." May 17 - Bloomberg (Gabrielle Coppola): "Lenders are tightening the spigot on new auto loans, making it harder for U.S. consumers with weak credit to buy a car, data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York show. New car loans for subprime borrowers fell in the first quarter to $25.9 billion, the lowest in two years... Drivers with credit scores below 620 now comprise less than 20% of new loans, down from almost 30% a decade ago. Borrowers with the highest credit scores -- 760 or more -- made up nearly a third of new auto loan originations in the first quarter as lenders target the safer deals." May 16 - Reuters (Lucia Mutikani): "U.S. manufacturing production recorded its biggest increase in more than three years in April, bolstering the view that economic growth picked up early in the second quarter despite a surprise decline in homebuilding. The broad strength in factory output... added to labor market data in suggesting the growth slowdown in the first quarter was temporary... 'The sharp increase in industrial activity is a clear sign that the first-quarter sluggishness is behind us. It comes at the right time as home construction seems to have hit a lull,' said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors..." May 14 - Wall Street Journal (Tripp Mickle and Eliot Brown): "Apple Inc. employees last month began testing the company's latest innovation: Apple Park, one of history's most expensive corporate campuses and the leading example of the tech industry's newfound love for splashy architecture. The first of 12,000 Apple headquarters employees moved from several drab, stone buildings in Cupertino, Calif., to space across town in the 2.8-million-square-foot circular building that resembles a spaceship. It features a seamless, curved-glass exterior and a theater that architects said was designed to look like a MacBook Air. The estimated $5 billion project commanded years of attention from top Apple executives... Apple Park is the most lavish in a spate of glitzy new architectural projects by tech titans at a time when their businesses are booming and market valuations are soaring to new heights. Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc. have tapped top architects Frank Gehry and Bjarke Ingels for expansions, Amazon is building giant glass globes containing an indoor forest in Seattle, and business-software company Salesforce.com Inc. paid to put its name on a new, 61-story tower that will be the tallest building in San Francisco." May 15 - Bloomberg (Martin Z Braun and Jonathan Levin): "San Juan's gleaming commuter train seemed like a coup -- the kind of big-ticket item many U.S. cities can only dream of. More than a decade on, the Tren Urbano is a monument to the folly, bloat and abuse that finally bankrupted Puerto Rico. Despite years of planning, it sells only a third of the rides it needs to, and loses roughly $50 million a year. The cost so far: $2.25 billion, $1 billion more than planned. That, in a nutshell, is Puerto Rico's story. With Wall Street's help, the U.S. commonwealth borrowed tens of billions in the bond markets, only to squander much of it on grand projects, government bureaucracy, everyday expenses and worse. Debts were piled on debts, even as the economy gave way." Japan Watch: May 16 - Reuters (Leika Kihara): "Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said he was 'quite sure' the central bank could smoothly exit from its massive monetary stimulus when the appropriate time to do so came. But he also said the BOJ 'always' had room to expand monetary stimulus to achieve its 2% inflation target, indicating that wages and prices had been slow to respond to improvements in the economy. The remarks suggest the BOJ is in no rush to swing monetary policy in either direction, particularly toward cutting back on stimulus with the economic recovery still fragile. 'There may be some challenging issues, but I'm quite sure the BOJ has enough tools' to manage an exit from its stimulus program, Kuroda told a seminar..." May 18 - Bloomberg (Keiko Ujikane): "Japan's economy advanced for a fifth straight quarter, the longest expansion in a decade, supported by continued strength in exports. Domestic demand rebounded, but economists question whether this strength will continue. Gross domestic product increased by an annualized 2.2% in the three months ended March 31 (estimate +1.7%), accelerating from a revised 1.4% in the previous quarter... The last time Japan strung together this many quarters of growth was in 2006..." May 15 - Bloomberg (Gareth Allan and Shingo Kawamoto): "Earnings reports by Japan's three megabanks on Monday pointed to a fourth straight fall in combined annual profit, even as the impact of negative interest rates begins to ease. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc., and Mizuho Financial Group Inc. forecast a 4.8% drop in combined net income to 2.13 trillion yen ($18.8bn) in the fiscal year ending March 2018 from the previous 12 months." EM Watch: May 19 - Reuters (Brad Brooks and Lisandra Paraguassu): "Brazil's top court released plea-bargain testimony on Friday accusing President Michel Temer and his two predecessors of receiving millions of dollars in bribes, the most damaging development yet in a historic political corruption probe. The testimony made public by the Supreme Court is from executives of the world's largest meatpacking company, and raises serious doubts about whether Temer can maintain his grip on the presidency. The scandals that have engulfed Brazil's political class and many business elites reduce the chances that Temer, a conservative who took office after leftist former President Dilma Rousseff was impeached last year, can push through economic reforms crucial for Latin America's biggest country to recover from its worst recession on record." May 16 - Bloomberg (Blaise Robinson): "The scorching gains that have put emerging-market equities on track for their best year since 2009 are showing signs of flagging. After the MSCI Emerging Market Index's surge of about 17% this year, momentum indicators suggest the rally is losing steam. The benchmark is approaching a resistance level formed by the trend line connecting the peaks in 2011, 2014 and 2015. While breaking above it would be a bullish omen, other technical signals also point to some overheating." May 19 - Bloomberg (Eric Martin): "Mexico's central bank unexpectedly raised its key interest rate for a sixth straight meeting to keep an increase in consumer prices from deepening after inflation accelerated to almost double policy makers' target... Banco de Mexico, led by Governor Agustin Carstens, lifted its benchmark by a quarter point to 6.75% Thursday..." May 16 - Bloomberg (Isabella Cota, Eric Martin, and Michelle Davis): "Mexican authorities have zeroed in on seven banks, including three from the U.S., as part of a widening investigation into price manipulation in the nation's bond market, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Local units of Banco Santander SA, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA, JPMorgan Chase & Co., HSBC Holdings Plc, Barclays Plc, Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America Corp. have become the focus of the probe..." Leveraged Speculator Watch: May 15 - Bloomberg (Susanne Barton): "Expectations for another boost in U.S. interest rates are wearing down gold bulls. Hedge funds and other large speculators cut long positions in bullion futures and options by the most in more than eight years last week." Geopolitical Watch: May 17 - Reuters (Christine Kim): "South Korean President Moon Jae-in said... there was a 'high possibility' of conflict with North Korea, which is pressing ahead with nuclear and missile programs it says are needed to counter U.S. aggression. Moon made his comments hours after South Korea, which hosts 28,500 U.S. troops, said it wanted to reopen a channel of dialogue with North Korea as Moon seeks a two-track policy... North Korea has made no secret of its work to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of striking the United States and has ignored calls to halt its nuclear and missile programs, even from China, its lone major ally." May 14 - CNN (Brad Lendon): "North Korea says the missile it tested Sunday is capable of carrying a large nuclear warhead, state media said... The country's leader, Kim Jong Un, supervised the launch of the Hwasong-12 missile that reached an altitude of 2,111.5 kilometers (1,312 miles) and flew 787 kilometers (489 miles)... The test was 'aimed at verifying the tactical and technological specifications of the newly developed ballistic rocket capable of carrying a large-size heavy nuclear warhead,' KCNA said." May 16 - Reuters (Christine Kim and Tom Miles): "North Korea's missile program is progressing faster than expected, South Korea's defense minister said... Han Min-koo told South Korea's parliament that Sunday's test had been detected by the controversial U.S. THAAD anti-missile system, which was deployed in South Korea last month, infuriating China. North Korea has defied all calls to rein in its nuclear and missile programs, even from China, its lone major ally, calling them legitimate self-defense. It has been working to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of striking the U.S. mainland, and experts say Sunday's test was another step toward that aim." May 14 - Bloomberg (Jordan Robertson and Rebecca Penty): "An unrivaled global cyber-attack is poised to continue claiming victims Monday as people return to work and turn on their desktop computers, even as hospitals and other facilities gained the upper hand against the first wave. More than 200,000 computers in at least 150 countries have so far been infected, according to Europol, the European Union's law enforcement agency. The U.K.'s National Cyber Security Centre said new cases of so-called ransomware are possible 'at a significant scale.' 'We've seen the rise of ransomware becoming the principal threat, I think, but this is something we haven't seen before -- the global reach is unprecedented,' Europol Executive Director Rob Wainwright said..." May 16 - New York Times (Nicole Perlroth and David E. Sanger): "Intelligence officials and private security experts say that new digital clues point to North Korean-linked hackers as likely suspects in the sweeping ransomware attacks that have crippled computer systems around the world. The indicators are far from conclusive, the researchers warned, and it could be weeks, if not months, before investigators are confident enough in their findings to officially point the finger at Pyongyang's increasingly bold corps of digital hackers. The attackers based their weapon on vulnerabilities that were stolen from the National Security Agency and published last month." May 16 - New York Times (Choe Sang-Hun, Paul Mozur, Nicole Perlroth and David E. Sanger): "They take legitimate jobs as software programmers in the neighbors of their home country, North Korea. When the instructions from Pyongyang come for a hacking assault, they are believed to split into groups of three or six, moving around to avoid detection. Ever since the 1980s, reclusive North Korea has been known to train cadres of digital soldiers to engage in electronic warfare and profiteering exploits against its perceived enemies... In more recent years, cybersecurity experts say, the North Koreans have spread these agents across the border into China and other Asian countries to help cloak their identities. The strategy also amounts to war-contingency planning in case the homeland is attacked. Now this force of North Korean cyberhacking sleeper cells is under new scrutiny in connection with the ransomware assaults that have roiled much of the world over the past four days."     Tweet Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. Author: Doug Noland Doug Noland Credit Bubble Bulletin I just wrapped up 25 years (persevering) as a "professional bear." My lucky break came in late-1989, when I was hired by Gordon Ringoen to be the trader for his short-biased hedge fund in San Francisco. Working as a short-side trader, analyst and portfolio manager during the great nineties bull market - for one of the most brilliant individuals I've met - was an exciting, demanding and, in the end, a grueling and absolutely invaluable learning experience. Later in the nineties, I had stints at Fleckenstein Capital and East Shore Partners. In January 1999, I began my 16 year run with PrudentBear, working as strategist and portfolio manager with David Tice in Dallas until the bear funds were sold in December 2008. In the early-nineties, I became an impassioned reader of The Richebacher Letter. The great Dr. Richebacher opened my eyes to Austrian economics and solidified my lifetime passion for economics and macro analysis. I had the good fortune to assist Dr. Richebacher with his publication from 1996 through 2001. Prior to my work in investments, I worked as a treasury analyst at Toyota's U.S. headquarters. It was working at Toyota during the Japanese Bubble period and the 1987 stock market crash where I first recognized my love for macro analysis. Fresh out of college I worked as a Price Waterhouse CPA. I graduated summa cum laude from the University of Oregon (Accounting and Finance majors, 1984) and later received an MBA from Indiana University (1989). By late in the nineties, I was convinced that momentous developments were unfolding in finance, the markets and policymaking that were going unrecognized by conventional analysis and the media. I was inspired to start my blog, which became the Credit Bubble Bulletin, by the desire to shed light on these developments. I believe there is great value in contemporaneous analysis, and I'll point to Benjamin Anderson's brilliant writings in the "Chase Economic Bulletin" during the Roaring Twenties and Great Depression era. Ben Bernanke has referred to understanding the forces leading up to the Great Depression as the "Holy Grail of Economics." I believe "The Grail" will instead be discovered through knowledge and understanding of the current extraordinary global Bubble period.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: 3 Top Dividend Stocks to Buy Now Ford, Qualcomm, and Welltower have two things in common: high dividend yields and good reasons to buy the stocks right now. Keith Speights (TMFFishBiz) May 28, 2017 at 7:41AM Pretty much anytime is a good time to buy the right dividend stocks. But some times are better than others. Now appears to be a great time to buy three particular dividend stocks: Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM), and Welltower Inc. (NYSE:HCN). All three of these stocks boast high dividend yields. And good things are happening for each company. Here's why Ford, Qualcomm, and Welltower are three top dividend stocks you can buy right now. Image source: Getty Images. Ford: A new driver It hasn't been a great 12 months for Ford. The big automaker's stock is down by a double-digit percentage. Ford recently announced plans to cut around 1,400 jobs this year. And the company replaced its CEO. That makes for plenty of turmoil, but it also gives investors a reason to take a hard look at the stock. New CEO Jim Hackett isn't inheriting as big of a mess as some of the headlines might indicate. Ford posted stellar sales and earnings in 2015 and really good numbers last year. The company's first-quarter performance was dismal, but one quarter doesn't mean a whole lot in the big scheme of things. While it's too early to know how Hackett will do at the helm, I think his hiring gives investors a reason to buy. Hackett did a great job turning things around at SteelCase. He's also very familiar with Ford's business, serving on the board of directors since 2013. Ford's dividend continues to look quite appealing. Its yield stands at 5.52%. The company is currently using less than 64% of earnings to fund the dividend program. With this solid dividend and a new, capable CEO in the driver's seat, Ford looks like a buy in my view. Qualcomm: Bad news presents good opportunities There has been plenty of bad news for Qualcomm so far in 2017. The mobile-chip giant became embroiled in litigation with Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) over patent royalty issues and faced allegations from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) over anti-competitive practices. However, things have started to look up for Qualcomm recently. J.P. Morgan analyst Rod Hall upgraded the stock in anticipation of an upcoming closure of Qualcomm's pending acquisition of NXP Semiconductors. The deal would allow Qualcomm to reduce its dependence on the smartphone market and make it the biggest automotive-chip maker in the world. Qualcomm still faces challenges. Although the company hopes the FTC will drop its antitrust lawsuit, the Apple litigation certainly won't magically go away. Still, closing of the NXP acquisition could go a long way toward relieving investors' anxieties. There are a couple of silver linings to Qualcomm's woes as well. Thanks to the company's issues, the stock's valuation is attractive, with a forward earnings multiple below 15. Qualcomm's dividend yield has also been driven higher and now stands at 3.95%.  Welltower: A positive change in direction Unlike Ford and Qualcomm, Welltower has enjoyed a pretty good year thus far in 2017. Shares of the healthcare real estate investment trust are up thanks in large part to Welltower's continued repositioning of its core portfolio. In November, the company announced that it planned to shift its portfolio away from long-term and post-acute-care (LTPAC) properties and more to private-pay healthcare real estate. This move was positive in two key respects. First, private-pay healthcare, such as senior living communities, tend to be more profitable than LTPAC properties are. Second, the sale of assets helps Welltower reduce its debt load. There is some short-term pain associated with the portfolio repositioning, though. Welltower's first-quarter funds from operations decreased from the prior-year period because of asset sales stemming from the strategic shift. However, the company's senior housing portfolio performed well during the quarter. Welltower's change in focus is good for long-term investors. So is the company's dividend. Welltower currently claims a solid dividend yield of 4.75%.   Keith Speights owns shares of Apple and JPMorgan Chase. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple, Ford, and Qualcomm.

Innovations YEREVAN. - Knowledge of ember.js will speed up the work of Armenian web developers, worker of Ucraft, Tigran Simonyan, told Armenian News – NEWS.am at BarCamp IT forum held in Yerevan on Sunday.   According to Simonyan, Ember makes the framework of application on Javacript, which simplifies web design. Apple is a good example of developing not only web but also desktop apps, he added. Google and Facebook use their libraries of MVC templates, AngularJS and React, but many other large companies like Apple use Ember. In Simonyan’s words, LinkedIn also recently used it to re-write its website. “Ready app frameworks release from the need to make complex architectural working files, considerably simplifying the work. Thus, it is very useful for our web developers to know these technologies,” he noted.  Armenia News - NEWS.am !

Out of the 5,045 people surveyed across five countries -- the US, the UK, Italy, Germany and France -- 30 percent answered they trust autonomous driving technology put together by auto firms, according to the survey complied by Inrix, a US-based connected car services and transportation analytics firm. “Consumers showed a tendency to trust conventional automakers based on familiarity. This is because self-driving technology is not yet complete, and has room for improvement,” according to Inrix. Next up on the list of trusted self-driving technology developer were IT firms, such as Apple and Google, backed by 20 percent of respondents, while 9 percent answered they would not trust autonomous cars at all, the survey showed. The market for self-driving cars is expected to reach $42 billion by 2025, according to US-based global consulting firm Boston Consulting Group. It is also anticipated to stand for one-fourth of vehicle sales worldwide by 2035, said BCG. Conventional automakers, for now, are seen to have an advantage over rival industries in producing affordable self-driving cars. “The era of autonomous driving is just around the corner. However, lowering the cost of technologies related to self-driving, in particular lidar sensors, is a key hurdle in popularizing self-driving vehicles,” said an official of a local auto parts company. (123rf) Lidar, or light detection and ranging sensors measure the precise location of objects and humans surrounding the vehicle. They are essential in self-driving vehicles. “IT firms have so far headed the development of lidar sensors and autonomous driving technologies. Conventional automakers, however, seem to have an upper hand in lowering the cost of lidar sensors due to economics of scale and familiarity,” he added. Hyundai Motor, South Korea’s biggest automotive company, is striving to develop autonomous cars with an affordable price tag, along with a standard platform for autonomous cars that is accessible to the public. “Automotive companies working on autonomous cars are trying to secure self-developed autonomous technologies. Hyundai Motor is putting in all efforts to release mass-produced low-price self-driving models,” said Lee Jin-woo, the head of Hyundai Motor’s Intelligent Safety Technology Center. Lee added, Hyundai Motor is willing to cooperate with related IT and auto parts companies to hasten the day they introduce autonomous cars at a low-price.  By Kim Bo-gyung (lisakim425@heraldcorp.com) 영어뉴스를 통한 ListeningㆍReading 실력 향상 단기 학습 프로그램 [NEST] 1.

He started joining bodybuilding competitions in 1994 like Mr. Philippines and Musclemania World Championship. He won a number of times from the contests. He was the over-all winner in the “Muscleman Universe 2008” held in Miami, Florida, USA. Jerick is currently focusing in coaching since he retired in 2012. What’s inside your bag? I carry my needs inside my bag like my food and vitamin supplements on a daily basis. I also bring my daily important stuffs such as towels, toothbrush, sunglasses, extra shirt, keys, power bank, workout suits and baking soda. Baking Soda has so many uses like alternative for soap and also serves as natural deodorant. What electronic gadgets are you currently using? I am a big fan of Apple. I use iPhone 5S because I prefer a phone with a smaller screen size.  It is comfortable to use and easy to place on my pocket. I intentionally did not upgrade my phone for the mentioned reason. When I go for workout, I like to use my Dr. Dre Beat headphone that helps me feeling good during my workout. For my camera, I am using Canon DSL Camera. What’s inside your closet? I place all my important stuff inside my closet from T-shirts, top tank, shorts, jogging pants, jackets and other personal stuffs. I do have also my formal and casual collections. I bought a vault to keep my important documents like my passport What is your style of clothing? Being a trainer in the gym, I like wearing shorts, top tank, T-Shirts, sports shoes and it also depends on the weather. During winter season, I like to wear formal coat and a jacket especially when I go for strolling. What clothing brands do you think closely fit your sense of fashion? A brand for me has no significant preference when it comes to purchasing clothes. For me, the comfort and the genuine design are the factors I consider in buying clothes. Most of my outfit are from Nike, Billabong and EFS. What is your favorite perfume? It is very seldom that I wear a perfume not unless during special occasion. I have several collections from Dior Sauvage, Giorgio Armani and Hugo. I believe in the carcinogenic effect of the perfumes in our body that’s why I try to limit using it. What is your favorite brand of shoes? My favorite NBA player is Lebron James that’s why I am collecting some pair of shoes from Nike Lebron 12 and I am planning to purchase the Lebron 13 White. For some casual wears, I like the collections from Adidas. Since I am  New Wave baby, I like the Dr. Martens Boots and Creepers shoes by Underground UK. Are you a shopaholic? No. I only purchase an item if it’s necessary and could really pleases me to decide to buy it. That’s why I always keep my favorite quote in my mind “Buy what you need, not what you want”. During weekends when I get bored, I usually go out and visit health stores to explore what are the new offers for vitamins and body building supplements. I like to go out with my family to visit some restaurants as well.  We need to be always practical for us to reach our financial goals. What inspires or influences you to buy an item? Personally, my choice in buying something and availing services is largely affected by the celebrity endorsers from different fields. It has a big impact and influence to consumers. One important factor I consider is the advocacy for a certain product or brand where they get involve like in helping Charitable institutions. What brands do you trust for your skin care? When it comes to skin care, the natural is much better. I like to apply organic and natural products to my skin like apple cider vinegar, avocado, raw honey and baking soda. It is the best way to maintain a healthy skin and get rid of those toxic chemicals which some beauty products are using. What is a Branded Pinoy for you? Being Branded Pinoy means a Filipino who showcase his/her good character traits genuinely. We are known to be a hardworking people. We always show passion to our work that enable us to excel in any field. Ever since I started in body building, I have made a promised that I would excel and make my fellow countrymen proud of me. I have accomplished it when I won the major competition.  Facebook Comments Website Comments come here March 6th, 2017 Reply XY1nAw Muchos Gracias for your blog article.

By Cella Lao Rousseau Saturday, May 27, 2017 at 9:00 am EDT 15 Comments Is there a reason you haven't switched to Android yet? Join the iMore forums discussion and let us know the rhyme to your reason! People who are diehard Apple fans were probably just offended reading the title of this post, but is there an actual reason why you haven't switched to Android? I mean, Android is only coming out with better and better phones, so it would be silly to say that the quality isn't the same or that the features are horrible… So what gives? Mike Tanasychuk 12-05-2016 09:47 AM “ What keeps you tethered to Apple? Have you thought about switching to Android, but just can't take the plunge? Maybe you have a full Apple ecosystem and switching to Android would ruin your flow? Maybe Android's intimidating? I've switched back and forth over the years, and even though iPhone is fun, something always keeps me going back to Android (and my first smartphone was the iPhone...

When using my last one, the Moto X, I realized I kept trying to make my Android device perform and look like an iPhone. I didn't use widgets or any of the extra things built into Android. I grew tired and bored of customizing my devices. I just want my device to work out of the box. In addition fragmentation, disjointed UI, finiky battery life, and lower quality... Reply While others say that their heart will always be with the iPhone, regardless of how fancy Android devices get: toneofark 12-05-2016 03:48 PM “ I've tried others, but I always seem to come back to iPhone. Sure Android gives you more freedom to customize this and that, root and tinker with things. After a while I got tired of all that. I just want my phone and apps to do what they're supposed to do. Add in that iPhone plays nicer with my Mac, as the saying goes "if it ain't broke don't fix it." Reply So if you had a chance to switch from an iPhone to an Android, would you?

After 2 years no longer supported - huge fail for me. Despite minimal apps and apple ram, Nexus 4 slowed down over time. Google Now was useless to me - I do not want to see travelling time to work when I have a day off. Big phone size is an issue for me for all high spec androids. And, no viable android tablet (a tablet is combination of hardware and software).

Everyone said it was the best phone on the market. Still it lagged ever so slightly. Just enough for me to retouch an icon just when something else was popping up and send me into a spin. I hated the phone with a passion. I'm a geek - I love this stuff but I switched back to my buttery smooth Iphone as soon as I could. 0 1 day ago Reply dcdevito I was an iPhone 3G owner then switched to Android in 2009, and then just switched back to the iPhone 2 weeks ago. I grew tired of battery life deterioration after each release on Nougat (OnePlus 3 Oxygen OS), I grew tired of UI inconsistencies, I grew tired of troubleshooting my phone, I grew tired of my GPS losing signal while driving to my new job on my first day (true story), I grew tired of not having a good selection of accessories, I grew tired of poorly written apps, I grew tired of poor signal strength, and I grew tired of inconsistent cameras. I felt in 2017 it's time to start thinking outside the cell phone. I'm an avid runner (~6-10 mi/week) and I felt Android's health accessories, apps and services lacking. I exported all my Google Fit data and imported it into Strava (2017 data anyway), which is now hooked into HealthKit. Just the sheer amount of data Healthkit has is just impressive and a breath of fresh air (no pun intended). I also love Apple Pay. Android Pay (and Google Wallet before it) was so poorly implemented and weak. With Apple Pay I feel more secure about making digital payments and I love how many apps have it included now as well, this just doesn't exist in Android land. And I'm also an avid Google user, and over the last 2 years now it's clear Google is cross platform with all their latest and greatest apps and services are fully functional on Android and iPhone. And now with Assistant on the iPhone it's not only a seamless transition to iOS, but Google has more apps on iOS (and I would also add their iOS app counterparts are actually better designed and better performing ironically). So I'm back home and it feels great on my 6s, my 7 Plus arrives Tuesday. My wife is also sick and tired of Android and she too is getting an iPhone soon. 0 1 day ago Reply DavidMalcolm There's several reasons for me: 1. AirPlay: I have a Sony AirPlay and BT speaker, I also have an AirPort Express, and Apple TV. I love being able to stream content (mostly music) from my phone, Mac or iPad to any of these devices. 2. Yearly updates: Every year around June Apple releases several major new software features, and I don't need to buy a new device to get them. Sure each new iPhone comes out with new features too, but most of those are hardware related. On Android most of the time you don't get many or any new features half way through the life of your product. And you certainly don't get security updates with most devices. 3. Consistent UI: While Android users often beat the drum of being able to customize their devices. I always pick up the devices and even if they're stock, I have to scratch my head to figure out where the settings for email or airplane mode are. I used to do tech support for a major ISP and calls from Android users were the worst. They often were from people who "bought the free one" so they typically weren't bright to begin with. And then getting that person to know what they were doing on the device was often a nightmare. iOS you could just pick up any iOS device and know you were seeing the same thing as the user. Color Accuracy: This one isn't an issue anymore but Samsung used to intentionally oversaturate the greens on their displays. Where as Apple makes a lot more effort in general to be mindful of making colour reproduction across their devices a priority. Responsiveness: iOS was made from the ground up for a touch enabled device. So touch is prioritized differently than Android. Even now new Android devices still often have stuttery jerky behaviour when I play with them, compared to iOS devices. Games: I don't game much right now because I'm not working a job that has me bored a lot. But when I was on the phones iOS games were always the best. You can get games that actually let you pay for them instead of being freemium garbage. Consistency: If my iPhone gets stolen, I can buy a new one, connect to WiFi, and wait an hour or two for everything to be back on my phone just like it was before. People who weren't even intentionally backing up their phones can do that. Most Android users I know end up posting on Facebook "Can everyone text me their numbers? Got a new phone, lost the other one." Hardware Reliability: Apple is still tops for device reliability. Sure your dumb cousin might break their screen. But for people who don't destroy their phones themselves, most iPhones stay reliable through out their lives. Plus if you pay a bit extra for Apple Care Plus you can have piece of mind against even your dumb mistakes. Most Android vendors are finding any corners they can to cut in the hopes of saving small bits of money, but it means the devices are often far less reliable. Apps: Everyone knows if an App is any good it's on iOS and iOS is probably the better version of it since iOS apps take way less work to develop for and clear up issues with. I Buy the Product I'm Not the Product: With Android the whole reason Google develops it is to cause you to use Google more and make them more money. With Apple I know they're making a device that I'm willing to pay for. This little philosophical difference in motivation is evidenced in all sorts of little ways. Those are just some of the reasons for me. Also every time I get a new iPhone I know it's going to be improved over my last one. Where as if you get a new Android phone hopefully it's camera is better, but it might not be. Hopefully it's screen is better, but it might not be. 0 1 day ago Reply markbyrn Why is this moronic troll bait in my RSS feed? Is iMore desperate for hits or what? I can understand some stooge fanboy shilling for Google and it's fragmented OS but iMore have some respect for your readers. BTW, I'm agnostic when it comes to platforms; I use most including Android but don't stooge; consumers should press for better tech regardless of source rather than stooge. 0 1 day ago Reply DannyJJK It's not trollbait, this offers a good discussion as to what the iPhone has which has given people reason not to switch 0 14 hours ago Reply BBelgum Why haven't you switched to RC Cola yet? 0 1 day ago Reply GlennRuss Simple, my needs. I have a MacBook Pro, MacMini(mainly for music) iPad, iPad mini. So an iPhone makes sense. Android has really improved over the years, but after being with Apple so long, switching now means major revamp of my products which will not meet all of my needs. I still have a data free device when the power goes off, and I loose WiFi, and do not want to use up data on LTE. It is called a Sony Walkman. Of course you have to dust off the cassette tapes. 0 1 day ago Reply Crosswhite17 When I switched from iOS to android, all my family told me I would regret it, and they were correct. Although I have several android devices, they all lack something in one way or another. I am switching back to iOS later this year and am currently considering going for the iPhone SE as I prefer the more pocketable form factor. Will probably wait and see if the iPhone 7 gets a drop in price first though as I don't want to spend as much on a phone as the iPhone 8 is rumoured to cost. Posted via the iMore App for Android 0 1 day ago Reply Batavian Two reasons: 1) All my friends use iMessages. 2) Google only supports Android devices for two years. 0 3 hours ago Reply codybryan I have used iPhones because of iTunes. I have over 45,000 songs in my collection. I also have over 300 audiobooks. There is no iTunes for Android. Plus, I have been using Macs since 1991. My current iPhone is the 7 plus with 256 gigs. I use it to keep in touch with friends and relatives in Thailand. Works for me. Androids are great phones, too. This is like the Canon/Nikon debate with cameras. Both do the job. 0 1 hour ago Reply ewelch No, never considered it because I like devices that get updates for years after release. iOS gets more new apps first. ***Omni software!*** Apple's support. I am invested in the ecosystem. Why change and lose all that inventory of apps, knowledge, etc? Also I prefer to avoid Google's intrusive selling me as the product to their real customers, advertisers. 0 7 min ago Reply Menu Log in or Sign up Search Apple Apps & Games Accessories & Toys Photo & Video Health & Fitness Movies & Music Transport Security Rumors Analysis How To The Best Reviews Deals Newsletter Forums Podcasts Android Central WindowsCentral iMore CrackBerry Connectedly TeslaCentral VRHeads MrMobile Modern Dad About Contact Us Jobs Privacy & Terms Mobile Nations 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2017 Mobile Nations Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Careers: Writer | Dev Licensing External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner

The $217 billion spending bill sent to Republican Gov. Greg Abbott will likely be a quiet footnote to a rancorous legislative session that ends Monday - upended by a "bathroom bill" targeting transgender people and an immigration crackdown on so-called "sanctuary cities." The tensions simmered into the final weekend as Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, Apple CEO Tim Cook and a dozen other tech industry giants sent a letter to Abbott on Saturday that again urged him to abandon a so-called bathroom bill. "Such laws are bad for employees and bad for business," the letter read. Democrats, teachers and advocates for Texas' poor warned that the lean new budget for a booming state - which boasts four of the five fastest-growing large cities in the U.S. - will have lasting consequences. Deepening the wound, they say, is the Legislature leaving $11 billion untouched. But a staunchly conservative wing of the Texas Republican Party that's growing in size and influence made their presence on the budget felt. Led by GOP Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, an evangelical former conservative talk radio host, the Senate resisted calls from Republican House moderates to use more emergency savings to offset an oilfield slowdown and funnel more money to classrooms. GUNS ON SCHOOL PROPERTY Texas lawmakers voted to allow handgun permit holders to have guns in their parked cars outside schools. The Senate gave final approval to the measure, sending it to Gov. Greg Abbott for his consideration. The vote came a day after Abbott signed into law a sharp decrease in fees paid to obtain a handgun license. The bill allowing guns in parked cars at schools is aimed at teachers and school workers who want to keep their weapons in their vehicles without violating state law. Opponents worry it raises the potential for danger if a car is burglarized on school property. PROTECTING JUDGES Texas will beef up security for judges under a bill signed into law by Gov. Greg Abbott after an Austin judge was wounded but survived an alleged assassination attempt. The bill requires the state to set up a special judicial security division and allows personal security for state judges who have been threatened or attacked. Court security officers will get special training and the law restricts release of personal information of current and former judges. Saturday's bill signing was attended by State District Judge Julie Kocurek, who was wounded by a gunman in an ambush outside her home in 2015. After a long hospital stay and multiple surgeries, she has returned to the bench. Three men have been indicted in the attack. RIDE HAILING IN AUSTIN Ride-hailing giants Uber and Lyft, which left Texas's tech-savvy capital city a year ago over local fingerprint requirements for drivers, are set to return after state lawmakers intervened. Both companies say they'll be rolling on Austin's streets again Monday, when Gov. Greg Abbott is expected to sign into law a bill that puts the state - not local governments - in charge of regulating the ride-hailing industry. Uber and Lyft fled Austin after losing a bruising and expensive fight in 2016 to replace the city's ordinance that required fingerprint-based background checks of drivers, a variety of data reporting and other requirements. QUOTE OF THE DAY "Slim to none." - Sen. Larry Taylor, R-Friendswood on the hopes of a last-day revival of a school finance bill that includes the so-called "bathroom bill" and voucher provisions.

Gov. Dan Patrick holds a news conference at the Republican Party of Texas Headquarters, in Austin, Texas, on Jan. 9. Associated Press file photos Texas Gov. Greg Abbott talks to reporters outside the White House on March 24. A proposed Texas “bathroom bill” targeting transgender people neared collapse Friday over a deadlock. Republican Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said he is resolved to force a special session if a North Carolina-style law that could restrict bathroom access for transgender people doesn’t prevail ÇƒÓ but Abbott made clear later that he was calling the shots. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File) By PAUL J. WEBER and JIM VERTUNO, PAUL J. WEBER and JIM VERTUNO, Associated Press Published: May 27, 2017, 10:11 PM A   A AUSTIN, Texas — Texas will keep spending $800 million on border security while putting little new money into public schools, maintaining therapy cuts for disabled children and easing handgun license fees as the Republican-led Legislature approved a new state budget Saturday. The $217 billion spending bill sent to Republican Gov. Greg Abbott will likely be a quiet footnote to a rancorous legislative session that ends Monday — upended by a “bathroom bill” targeting transgender people and an immigration crackdown on so-called “sanctuary cities.” The tensions simmered into the final weekend as Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, Apple CEO Tim Cook and a dozen other tech industry giants sent a letter to Abbott on Saturday that again urged him to abandon a so-called bathroom bill. “Such laws are bad for employees and bad for business,” the letter read. Democrats, teachers and advocates for Texas’ poor warned that the lean new budget for a booming state — which boasts four of the five fastest-growing large cities in the U.S. — will have lasting consequences. Deepening the wound, they say, is the Legislature leaving $11 billion untouched. But a staunchly conservative wing of the Texas Republican Party that’s growing in size and influence made their presence on the budget felt. Led by GOP Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, an evangelical former conservative talk radio host, the Senate resisted calls from Republican House moderates to use more emergency savings to offset an oil field slowdown and funnel more money to classrooms. The rift between GOP factions in the House and Senate has now erupted in the final weekend over a “bathroom bill” and threatens to thrust the Legislature into a special session. Abbott, who unlike other GOP governors nationwide has welcomed possible bathroom restrictions for transgender people, gave no indication Saturday whether the he might keep lawmakers in Austin, Texas. Despite the tensions, the budget overwhelmingly cleared both the House and Senate, and Republicans in both chambers praised it as responsible belt-tightening in the face of slumping energy prices. One of the few bipartisan areas of consensus was a half-billion dollars in new money for Texas’ beleaguered child welfare system. “Our economy continued to prosper, but the price of oil fell,” said Republican Sen. Jane Nelson, the Senate budget chief. “We took steps to prepare for a tough budget cycle.” A glaring exception is border security. Two years after Texas nearly tripled state spending on patrolling the U.S.-Mexico border, and railed against then-President Barack Obama over the need to do so, Republicans are not letting up despite President Donald Trump’s vow to build a wall between the two countries. Without mentioning Trump by name, GOP House budget chairman John Zerwas said, “We cannot count on federal assistance at this time.” Democrats blasted the deployment of another 250 troopers and round-the-clock border patrols as unnecessary and criticized those expenditures over not fully restoring Medicaid cuts to therapy services for children with disabilities. Parents of children with speech delays, autism and other disabilities have pleaded with lawmakers since 2015 to reverse $350 million in cuts that were defended as a cost-saving measure. House Republicans wanted to restore 75 percent of the cuts, but the Senate resisted that reversal as well, agreeing to restore 25 percent. Conservatives also balked at a school finance overhaul despite the Texas Supreme Court last year declaring the current state system flawed, albeit still constitutional. Slashing first-time handgun licenses fees from $140 to $40, meanwhile, is expected to cost Texas more than $20 million over the next five years.

Drucken URL 28.05.2017 Von Peter Stelzel-Morawietz Whatsapp, Mail-Checker, Radio, Übersetzer, Passwörter oder das Wetter sind ein paar Beispiele für praktische Browser-Erweiterungen. PC-WELT stellt Plugins für Chrome, Firefox und Opera vor und zeigt, was Edge künftig kann. Empfehlen Diskutieren Drucken PDF URL Xing LinkedIn Twitter Google+ Facebook Webbrowser oder allgemein auch Browser sind spezielle Computerprogramme zur Darstellung von Webseiten im World Wide Web. So lautet die Begriffsdefinition auf der deutschsprachigen Wikipedia-Seite. Diese ursprüngliche Funktion erledigen die Browser natürlich immer noch, aber eben auch sehr viel mehr. Wie weit man das Browser-zentrierte Konzept treiben kann, demonstriert Google mit seinen vor allem in den USA beliebten Chromebooks . Auf diesen Notebooks mit dem Betriebssystem Chrome OS läuft als einzige Anwendung der Browser, alle weiteren Funktionen erfolgen im Web oder als Erweiterung. Und um genau solche Add-ons geht es im folgenden Artikel, in dem wir Ihnen die besten Browser-Erweiterungen am Windows-PC vorstellen. Anhand von zwei Beispielen möchten wir demonstrieren, wie praktisch die Zusatzprogramme für den Browser sind. Nehmen wir als Erstes den Quasi-Standard-Messenger Whatsapp auf dem Smartphone, und nehmen wir weiterhin an, jemand schreibt Ihnen und fragt Sie etwas, das ein wenig ausführlicher erklärt werden sollte. Auf der Bildschirmtastatur Ihres Smartphones wäre das Antworten recht mühsam, ein erläuternder Anruf vielleicht gerade unpassend. Also bleibt das Beantworten am PC, was dank Browser-Erweiterung und Tippen auf der PC-Tastatur eine Kleinigkeit ist. Ähnlich verhält es sich bei den zahlreichen Download-Helfern für Videoplattformen wie Youtube und Co., denn mit der passenden Extension landet der gestreamte Clip schnell auf der Festplatte. Nun ist Browser allerdings nicht gleich Browser, in Bezug auf die Erweiterungen gilt dies noch einmal mehr. Gerade Microsoft wollte mit seinem neuen Edge vieles besser machen und wirbt im Webstore, den man im Browser über "Erweiterungen -> Erweiterungen aus dem Store abrufen" aufruft, selbstbewusst mit "Optimiere Deinen Browser! Hol Dir diese nützlichen Erweiterungen, die speziell für Microsoft Edge entwickelt wurden." Das Angebot ist jedoch mehr als ernüchternd, nur ein gutes Dutzend lässt sich zum Zeitpunkt dieses Artikels installieren. Verglichen mit jeweils Tausenden von Add-ons für Chrome, Firefox und Opera ist das praktisch nichts. Damit haben wir die mit Abstand wichtigsten Browser bereits genannt. Chrome liegt hierzulande mittlerweile deutlich vor Firefox und der wiederum vor Safari. Weil der Apple-Browser aber besonders auf Rechnern mit Mac-OS Verwendung findet und die Erweiterungen nicht in der Windows-Version funktionieren, gehen wir nicht weiter auf Safari ein. Eine Art Geheimtipp stellt dagegen der in Deutschland nur im Ein-Prozent-Bereich verbreitete Opera dar. Denn zum einen ist der Browser aus Norwegen vergleichsweise schnell und bietet seit Kurzem außerdem sicheres VPN ohne Daten-oder Geschwindigkeitsbegrenzung. Zum anderen lässt sich der Funktionsumfang nicht nur mit fast 2000 Erweiterungen aus dem Opera-eigenen Webstore vergrößern, sondern mit einem Trick zusätzlich um die des Google-Browsers (mehr dazu im Kasten). Opera mit Chrome-Erweiterungen Dass Opera ein ausgezeichneter Browser ist, haben wir eingangs bereits begründet. Erweiterungen lassen sich zum einen über die offizielle Opera Add-on -Seite laden. Wir zeigen Ihnen aber auch, wie Sie die unzähligen Chrome-Add-ons im Opera-Browser nutzen. Installieren Sie Opera auf Ihrem Rechner und rufen Sie anschließend die Webseite mit den offiziellen Erweiterungen auf. Die zur Verfügung stehenden Einträge lassen sich hier wie bei Google und Mozilla gezielt heraussuchen, nach Bewertungen filtern oder durch Stöbern in den Rubriken finden. An die Chrome-Erweiterungen kommen Sie nun mit folgendem Trick: Im gerade geöffneten Opera-Webstore suchen Sie das Add-on „Download Chrome Extension“ und installieren es anschließend über die Schaltfläche „+ Zu Opera hinzufügen“. Öffnen Sie dann im Opera-Browser den Chrome-Webstore aufrufen, links die „Erweiterungen“ markieren und dort einen Eintrag auswählen, erkennt der Installationsserver Opera quasi als Chrome. Ein Klick auf „+ Hinzufügen“ installiert die Erweiterung, allerdings müssen Sie sie in den Erweiterungen mit zweimaligem Klick auf „Installieren“ noch aktivieren, weil sie aus einer vermeintlich unsicheren Quelle stammt und eben nicht aus dem Webstore von Opera. Wichtig: Der Trick funktioniert nur bei den echten Erweiterungen, nicht dagegen bei den Apps aus dem Chrome-Webstore. Der einfache Weg zu Ihren individuell besten Erweiterungen Kaum der Erwähnung wert: Auch Monate nach dem Start des neuen Microsoft-Browsers in Windows 10 stehen kaum Erweiterungen für Edge zur Verfügung. Foto: IDG Vielleicht nutzen Sie Whatsapp gar nicht und wollen auch keine Webvideos speichern! Keine Sorge, bei mehr als 10 000 Erweiterungen für Chrome und Firefox ist garantiert auch für Sie etwas dabei. Alle verfügbaren Hilfsprogramme finden Sie im Webstore des jeweiligen Browsers: Für Google Chrome hier , für Mozilla Firefox hier und für Opera hier . Alle drei Webstores sind ähnlich aufgebaut, Ihre persönlichen Favoriten können Sie dann aus dem anfangs schier unübersichtlichen Angebot auf ganz verschiedene Art und Weise heraussuchen. Da ist zunächst einmal die Freitextsuche. Wenn Sie beispielsweise oft online bei Amazon einkaufen, installieren Sie einfach eine passende Erweiterung für diesen Shop. Genauso gehen Sie beim Musikplayer Spotify, bei der Fernhilfe Teamviewer, beim Onlinespeicher Dropbox sowie bei allem anderen vor, was Sie konkret nutzen. Hilfreich sind des Weiteren die Kategorien, in die die Add-ons thematisch eingruppiert sind: Datenschutz, Sicherheit und Suchwerkzeuge sind nur drei Beispielrubriken. Weil die Auswahl teilweise auch darin noch gewaltig ist, orientieren Sie sich einfach an der Beliebtheit, also an der Anzahl der Downloads und an der Bewertung durch andere Nutzer. Alle Hersteller arbeiten mit einem System von null bis zu fünf Sternen für eine Top-Bewertung. Bei Opera fällt das Stöbern derzeit noch ziemlich schwer, da sich die verschiedenen Filter nicht miteinander kombinieren lassen. Große Hilfen für Kommunikation, Mail und den Büroalltag Pocket heißt zwar nicht mehr wie früher ?Read it later?, der Dienst übernimmt aber noch die gleiche Aufgabe: nämlich das Sammeln von Webinhalten fürs spätere Lesen. Praktisch sind die zahlreichen Mailchecker. Sie zeigen hinter der Adresszeile gleich, ob und wie viele neue Nachrichten Sie haben, ohne dass Sie Ihr Mailprogramm starten oder sich im Webmailer erst anmelden müssten. Diese Add-ons stehen für einzelne Provider wie GMX, Web.de, Gmail, Yahoo oder Microsoft Office 365 zur Verfügung. Es gibt allerdings auch anbieterübergreifende Erweiterungen, zum Beispiel das hervorragende Simple Mail. Bereits erwähnt und für Whatsapp-Nutzer ein Muss ist Whatsapp Desktop. Print Edit und Capture & Print (für Firefox) und Print sowie Print Friendly & PDF helfen dabei, Webinhalte und -seiten vernünftig auszudrucken oder im PDF-Format zu speichern. Bewährt haben sich auch Fireshot (Firefox) und Awesome Screenshot (Chrome, Opera) zum Speichern und Verarbeiten von Webseiteninhalten. Der Evernote Web Clipper vereinfacht die Handhabung des gleichnamigen Notizdienstes. Der Google Translator übersetzt Webseiten aus fremden Sprachen ins Deutsche (oder umgekehrt), Wetterberichte fürs alltägliche Nachsehen gibt es zuhauf. Praktisch ist außerdem die Möglichkeit, Webinhalte zu sammeln und dann später zu lesen: Save to Pocket (früher: Read it later) muss bei Chrome nachinstalliert werden, in Firefox ist Pocket bereits integriert - rechts oben durch ein graues beziehungsweise rotes Icon. Voraussetzung für die Nutzung des Dienstes ist eine Registrierung. Übrigens: Die Sammelfunktion beschränkt sich keineswegs auf Text, sondern umfasst sämtliche Seiteninhalte und Videos. Möchten Sie Texte lieber auf Ihrem E-Book-Reader von Amazon lesen, nutzen Sie die App Push to Kindle oder Send to Kindle. Die Add-ons ePubReader und Readium ermöglichen es in Firefox respektive Chrome, E-Books im Browser am PC zu lesen. Wer oft Begriffe im Online-Lexikon von Wikipedia nachschlägt, der erhält mit der gleichnamigen Erweiterung sofortigen Zugriff. Bing-Google (Firefox) eignet sich für eingefleischte Google-Benutzer, die Erweiterungen leiten selbst von Microsoft fest mit der eigenen Internetsuche verknüpfte Dienste konsequent auf Google um. Sicherheit im Netz, Privatsphäre und Verschlüsselung Lange Zeit äußerst beliebt war die Browser-Erweiterung Web of Trust (WOT). Sie stuft Webseiten als vertrauenswürdig ein, ist aber wegen Datenschutzbedenken nun selbst in die Kritik geraten. Foto: IDG Sicherheit und Internet und damit Sicherheit im Browser gehören unmittelbar zusammen. Viele Jahre war "WOT - sicher surfen", die Erweiterung der Sicherheits-Community Web of Trust, sehr beliebt. Anfang November wurde bekannt, dass WOT ganz offensichtlich Nutzer ausgespäht und Benutzerdaten verkauft hat. Google und Mozilla haben das Add-on daraufhin aus ihren Stores entfernt. Deshalb nutzen Sie besser den McAfee Webadvisor, früher bekannt als McAfee Siteadvisor. Diese Erweiterung zeigt auch auf einen Blick über ein Farbsystem, ob eine Webseite vertrauenswürdig ist oder nicht - und zwar nicht erst, wenn Sie die Webseite aufgerufen haben, sondern bereits in der Trefferliste von Google. Grün heißt gefahrlos, Gelb "Bitte Vorsicht" und Rot warnt ausdrücklich vor möglichen Bedrohungen. Noscript (Firefox) beziehungsweise Noscript Suite Lite (Chrome und Opera) blockieren gefährliche Javascripts, Java-Applets, Flash-so-wie Silverlight-Animationen. Die Freigabe muss manuell erfolgen und gilt nur bis zum Schließen des Browsers, alternativ verwenden Sie eine Positivliste. LastPass verwaltet sicher Ihre Onlinezugänge, und Ghostery weist Sie beim Surfen auf versteckte Dienste hin, die im Hintergrund private Daten an Seitenbetreiber übermitteln, und blockiert diese auf Wunsch. Stealthy erfüllt gleich mehrere Funktionen, unter anderem sorgt das Umleiten über einen Proxy-Server für anonymes Surfen und das Verschleiern der IP-Adresse. Click & Clean löscht den Surfverlauf in Ihrem Browser, wenn Sie diesen schließen. Gelöscht werden außerdem der Cache, Cookies, gespeicherte Formulardaten, Passwörter und einiges mehr. Better Privacy soll vor "Super-Cookies" schützen, steht jedoch lediglich für Firefox zur Verfügung. Wiederum für die drei hier genannten Surftools gibt es HTTPS Everywhere. Damit werden Sie automatisch auf einen verschlüsselten Server desselben Anbieters umgeleitet, sofern ein solcher verfügbar ist und Sie zuerst die unsicherere Variante aufgerufen haben. Mithilfe von Mailvelope schließlich können Sie Ihre E-Mails einfach und sicher "end-to-end" verschlüsseln. Mit Ausnahme von Better Privacy existieren alle der zuletzt genannten Addons in Varianten sowohl für Firefox als auch für Chrome und damit auch für Opera. DownThemAll! DownThemAll! Ist ein genialer Download-Manager für Firefox, der den Download-Vorgang beschleunigt und beste Ordnung in die Downloads bringt. VideoDownloadHelper VideoDownloadHelper erlaubt das bequeme Herunterladen von Youtube-Videos auf die lokale Festplatte. Firebug Firebug fügt Firefox eine Reihe von Web-Entwickler-Tools hinzu, mit denen beispielsweise der Aufruf von CSS-, HTML- und Javascript-Code überwacht werden kann. NoScript Mit der Sicherheits-Erweiterung NoScript lässt sich Javascript für Websites deaktivieren, auch vorübergehend bis zum nächsten Aufruf. FlashGot Mit der Firefox Erweiterung FlashGot binden Sie fast jeden Download-Manager in Firefox ein. Klicken Sie zur Konfiguration nach der Installation mit der rechten Maustaste ins Browser-Fenster und wählen Sie "FlashGot Optionen". Google Translator for Firefox Google Translator for Firefox fügt Firefox einen neuen Kontextmenü-Eintrag hinzu, über den ein aktuell markierter Text schnell und bequem mit Google Translator in die eigene Sprache übersetzt werden kann. <br> Tab Mix Plus Tab Mix Plus erweitert die Tabbed-Browsing-Funktionen von Firefox um Funktionen wie das Duplizieren von Tabs, Kontrolle über das Öffnungsverhalten von Tabs und Fenstern, die Wiederherstellung geschlossener Tabs und vieles mehr. Auto-Sort Bookmarks Das Add-On Auto-Sort Bookmarks ermöglicht eine automatisierte Sortierung der Lesezeichen und bietet noch einige weitere praktische Funktionen, die den Umgang mit Favoriten erleichtern. IE Tab 2 Mittels IE Tab 2 lassen sich Websites innerhalb von Firefox mittels der Internet-Explorer-Engine öffnen. FireFTP FireFTP bietet einen leistungsstarken und sicheren FTP-Client direkt im Browser. Deutsches Wörterbuch Deutsches Wörterbuch (neue Rechtschreibung) fügt Firefox eine Rechtschreibprüfung hinzu, die beispielsweise alle Eingaben in Formularen überprüft. LastPass LastPass ist ein vom Browser unabhängiger und vielseitiger Passwort-Manager mit vielen Extra-Funktionen. So werden beispielsweise auf Wunsch automatisch sichere Passwörter für den Zugang zu einem Dienst generiert und gespeichert. Der Zugang zu allen Passwörtern erfolgt per Master-Passwort. ReminderFox Mit ReminderFox können Sie bequem Ihre Listen mit Erinnerungen und Aufgaben verwalten. Das AddOn erinnert Sie dann direkt im Browser an Ihre Termine. Forecast Weather Das Add-On Forecast Weather blendet in der Statusleiste von Firefox aktuelle Wetterinformationen und eine Wetter-Vorhersage ein. Image Block Mit Image Block können Sie das Laden von Bildern auf Websites verhindern. Dadurch wird das Surfen beschleunigt und die dabei übertragenen Daten reduziert. TinyURL Generator Mit TinyURL Generator kann per Mausklick für einen Link eine Kurz-URL via TinyURL erstellt werden. Außerdem zeigt das Add-On an, wohin eine Tiny-URL führt, wenn man mit dem Mauszeiger über einen solchen Link fährt. FastestFox - Schneller Surfen Surfen Sie schneller durch das Internet, durch die Optimierung gängiger Aufgaben. FastestFox hilft Ihnen nach Informationen zu suchen, in Wikipedia zu stöbern, Ihre Lieblingsseiten zu besuchen, beim Kopieren und Einfügen und vieles mehr. FireShot FireShot ist eine Erweiterung für den Firefox-Browser, die es ermöglicht, direkt aus dem Browser heraus ein Bildschirmfoto der aktuellen Internetseite zu erstellen und auf der Festplatte zu speichern. TV-Fox Mit dem kostenlosen Firefox Plugin TV-FOX erweitern Sie den Browser um eine Fernsehfunktion, mit der Sie gleich mehrere tausend Sender empfangen können. Zotero Mit der Firefox-Erweiterung Zotero lassen sich Zitate, Literaturhinweise und andere Fundstellen im Internet einfach und komfortabel sammeln. McAfee Site Advisor Site Advisor vom Sicherheitsspezialisten McAfee für Firefox- und IE-Explorer hilft Ihnen dabei, sicherer durch das Internet zu surfen. Greasemonkey Ist Greasemonkey unter Firefox installiert, lassen sich Greasemonkey-Scripts in Firefox aufnehmen, indem Sie das Script im Browser öffnen und dann „Extras, Install This User Script“ wählen. AniWeather AniWeather zeigt aktuelle Wetterinfos in Firefox an. Die Darstellung des aktuellen Wetters erfolgt animiert. ColorfulTabs ColorfulTabs färbt die geöffneten Tabs in unterschiedlichen Farben ein und erleichtert es dem Anwender so, den Überblick zu behalten. Download Statusbar Download Statusbar zeigt in der Statusleiste den Stand des aktuellen Downloads an. Angezeigt werden die verbleibende Download-Größe und die noch für den Download benötigte Zeit. FireFTP FireFTP ist ein FTP/SFTP-Client für Firefox. Sie können über FireFTP eine Verbindung zu einem FTP-Verzeichnis erstellen. Unterstützt werden SSL-Verschlüsselung, SFTP, Remote Editing und zahlreiche weitere Funktionen. Flagfox Das Firefox-Add-On Flagfox blendet nach der Installation und dem Neustart des Browsers künftig in der Adresszeile eine Landesflagge an, der der Anwender entnehmen kann, in welchem Land sich der Server der gerade aufgerufenen Website befindet. iMacros Immer wiederkehrende Eingaben können Sie mittels iMacros for Firefox automatisieren. Image Zoom ImageZoom fügt Firefox eine Zoom-Funktion für Bilder hinzu. New Tab King New Tab King ersetzt die langweilige leere Seite, die beim Öffnen eines neuen Tabs standardmäßig angezeigt wird. Stattdessen wird eine vollständig personalisierbare Seite angezeigt, die beispielsweise die kürzlich geschlosssenen Tabs oder die am häufigsten aufgerufenen Websites enthält. Personas Personas sind kostenlose, leicht zu installierende Themes für Firefox, die es leicht machen, das Aussehen von Firefox zu ändern. SpeedDial Beim Öffnen eines neuen Tabs können Sie mit SpeedDial eine Übersicht mit ihren Lieblingswebsites einblenden lassen. Genial: Speed Dial zeigt nicht nur einen Screenshot einer Website auf der Übersichtsseite an, sondern aktualisiert diesen auch auf Wunsch regelmäßig, damit Sie sofort auf der Übersichtsseite erkennen können, ob sich etwas auf der Website getan hat. Außerdem können Sie einen Ausschnitt von der gewünschten Website auswählen, der als Screenshot auf der Übersichtsseite angezeigt und dessen Inhalt ebenfalls regelmäßig aktualisiert werden kann. Ideal also beispielsweise für News-Junkies. Stylish Stylish erlaubt das Anpassen des Aussehens von Websites sowie der Programmoberfläche mit Hilfe eigener CSS-Stile. Web Developer Die Erweiterung Web Developer fügt dem Browser diverse praktische Web-Entwickler-Tools hinzu. FoxTab FoxTab spendiert Firefox eine schicke 3D-Ansicht.

My bag contains [my] make up kit, hand lotion and hand sanitizer aside from my other personal belongings like wallet and phone. Nothing beats clean hands! I guess a bag must basically contain things that are useful for our daily activities.  What electronic gadgets are you currently using? For my laptop I am using a Macbook and an iPhone for my phone. It’s a fact that Apple products have always have the good quality and more advanced.  What’s inside your closet? Mostly my dresses from different collections are the major stuff inside my closet. I like glamour office attires, which I can also wear for evening events. I am also into shoes and handbags which occupy the most space in my closet. What is your style of clothing? Talking about my style cannot be defined in one corner. We have to be flexible. For me, it depends on the weather and occasion. Living in Dubai you can see me with fit clothes during summer and you can see me with fur during winter and sportswear every morning as I hit the gym or if I am just at home spending my time painting and  when I am with my music,  I  just merely wear my rugged clothes. What clothing brands do you think closely fit your sense of fashion?  I don’t really have a clothing brand in particular, when I shop, I visit every store and find something that fits my body type. My principle is this: If it looks good on you, buy it! No matter what brand it is, as I shop depending on what makes me look good not just the hype.  That would help you boost confidence.  What is your favorite perfume?  Chloé Eu du Parfum, it has a fresh powdery floral scent which makes me feel happy and boost my self-esteem and femininity. What is your favorite brand of shoes?  I both like Louboutin and Valentino.  I invest in a pair of good quality shoes as those brands produce comfortable shoes, more durable and they last longer especially [since] I always love to wear heels so I need to have a good quality pair of shoes. Are you a shopaholic?  Yes, I was before to be honest, but when I started earning from my own sweat, I intended not to, but I treat myself once in a while. We all have to admit that buying something new (new car, new dress, new shoes, new bags) makes us feel great but it’s only passive. For as long as you are not spending beyond your budget, then that’s totally fine!  What inspires or influences you to buy an item? I normally buy stuff for my basic needs or replacing old items but if I see great deals on the stores, I don’t want to miss the opportunity!              What brands do you trust for your skin care? I use SK-II and Shiseido for my face. I am very careful when buying products for my skin especially since I have acne prone skin. That’s why these two brands stand out for me. I also use Nivea shower gel and Nivea Lotion ever since. What is a Branded Pinoy for you? Branded Pinoy for me is someone who has a positive outlook in life. Our brains are wired to find things we are looking for. If you are always cynical or waiting for things to go wrong, then your life will reflect that. On the other hand, having a positive outlook in life will bring you joy and provide you with inspiration when you least expect it.  Facebook Comments Website Comments free pron March 6th, 2017 Reply HL5bYg Pretty!

Weber and Jim Vertuno, Associated Press Connect with Paul J. Weber and Jim Vertuno Email Don't miss a story. Like us on Facebook. Like The Denton Record-Chronicle's Facebook Page AUSTIN -- Texas will keep spending $800 million on border security while putting little new money into public schools, maintaining therapy cuts for disabled children and easing handgun license fees as the Republican-led Legislature approved a new state budget Saturday. The $217 billion spending bill sent to Republican Gov. Greg Abbott will likely be a quiet footnote to a rancorous legislative session that ends Monday -- upended by a "bathroom bill" targeting transgender people and an immigration crackdown on so-called "sanctuary cities." The tensions simmered into the final weekend as Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, Apple CEO Tim Cook and a dozen other tech industry giants sent a letter to Abbott on Saturday that again urged him to abandon a so-called bathroom bill. "Such laws are bad for employees and bad for business," the letter read. Democrats, teachers and advocates for Texas' poor warned that the lean new budget for a booming state -- which boasts four of the five fastest-growing large cities in the U.S. -- will have lasting consequences. Deepening the wound, they say, is the Legislature leaving $11 billion untouched. But a staunchly conservative wing of the Texas Republican Party that's growing in size and influence made their presence on the budget felt. Led by GOP Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, an evangelical former conservative talk radio host, the Senate resisted calls from Republican House moderates to use more emergency savings to offset an oilfield slowdown and funnel more money to classrooms. The rift between GOP factions in the House and Senate has now erupted in the final weekend over a "bathroom bill" and threatens to thrust the Legislature into a special session. Abbott, who unlike other GOP governors nationwide has welcomed possible bathroom restrictions for transgender people, gave no indication Saturday whether the he might keep lawmakers in Austin. Despite the tensions, the budget overwhelmingly cleared both the House and Senate, and Republicans in both chambers praised it as responsible belt-tightening in the face of slumping energy prices. One of the few bipartisan areas of consensus was a half-billion dollars in new money for Texas' beleaguered child welfare system. "Our economy continued to prosper, but the price of oil fell," said Sen. Jane Nelson, R-Flower Mound, the Senate budget chief. "We took steps to prepare for a tough budget cycle." A glaring exception is border security. Two years after Texas nearly tripled state spending on patrolling the U.S.-Mexico border, and railed against then-President Barack Obama over the need to do so, Republicans are not letting up despite President Donald Trump's vow to build a wall between the two countries. Without mentioning Trump by name, GOP House budget chairman John Zerwas said "we cannot count on federal assistance at this time." Democrats blasted the deployment of another 250 troopers and round-the-clock border patrols as unnecessary and criticized those expenditures over not fully restoring Medicaid cuts to therapy services for children with disabilities. Parents of children with speech delays, autism and other disabilities have pleaded with lawmakers since 2015 to reverse $350 million in cuts that were defended as a cost-saving measure. House Republicans wanted to restore 75 percent of the cuts, but the Senate resisted that reversal as well, agreeing to restore only 25 percent. Conservatives also balked at a school finance overhaul despite the Texas Supreme Court last year declaring the current state system flawed, albeit still constitutional. Slashing first-time handgun license fees from $140 to $40, meanwhile, is expected to cost Texas more than $20 million over the next five years. "In retrospect, I probably shouldn't have voted for a single budget since I arrived in Austin six years ago," Dallas Democratic state Rep. Eric Johnson said.

The South Korean tech giant will hold a series of promotion events in Japan for the Galaxy S8 and the Galaxy S8 Plus. The official release is presumed to be early June. The flagship devices already went on sale in South Korea, China and the United States. Samsung, however, may face hurdles in promoting the Galaxy S8 in Japan as the Japanese smartphone market is dominated by Apple Inc. In the first quarter of the year, Samsung sold some 300,000 smartphones in Japan to account for 3.8 percent of the market share. In 2012, Samsung's presence was 14.8 percent, but it lost ground since then in the face of growing competition with Apple, whose market share topped 50 percent. sam@yna.co.kr (END) Most Viewed Seoul to ban smoking at cultural asset sites (4th LD) Park apologizes over alleged sexual misconduct by ex-spokesman Ssangyong says resumption of overnight shift turning point of normalization (2nd LD) N.

The $217 billion spending bill sent to Republican Gov. Greg Abbott will likely be a quiet footnote to a rancorous legislative session that ends Monday — upended by a "bathroom bill" targeting transgender people and an immigration crackdown on so-called "sanctuary cities." The tensions simmered into the final weekend as Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, Apple CEO Tim Cook and a dozen other tech industry giants sent a letter to Abbott on Saturday that again urged him to abandon a so-called bathroom bill. "Such laws are bad for employees and bad for business," the letter read. Democrats, teachers and advocates for Texas' poor warned that the lean new budget for a booming state — which boasts four of the five fastest-growing large cities in the U.S. — will have lasting consequences. Deepening the wound, they say, is the Legislature leaving $11 billion untouched. But a staunchly conservative wing of the Texas Republican Party that's growing in size and influence made their presence on the budget felt. Led by GOP Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, an evangelical former conservative talk radio host, the Senate resisted calls from Republican House moderates to use more emergency savings to offset an oilfield slowdown and funnel more money to classrooms. ___ GUNS ON SCHOOL PROPERTY Texas lawmakers voted to allow handgun permit holders to have guns in their parked cars outside schools. The Senate gave final approval to the measure, sending it to Gov. Greg Abbott for his consideration. The vote came a day after Abbott signed into law a sharp decrease in fees paid to obtain a handgun license. The bill allowing guns in parked cars at schools is aimed at teachers and school workers who want to keep their weapons in their vehicles without violating state law. Opponents worry it raises the potential for danger if a car is burglarized on school property. ___ PROTECTING JUDGES Texas will beef up security for judges under a bill signed into law by Gov. Greg Abbott after an Austin judge was wounded but survived an alleged assassination attempt. The bill requires the state to set up a special judicial security division and allows personal security for state judges who have been threatened or attacked. Court security officers will get special training and the law restricts release of personal information of current and former judges. Saturday's bill signing was attended by State District Judge Julie Kocurek, who was wounded by a gunman in an ambush outside her home in 2015. After a long hospital stay and multiple surgeries, she has returned to the bench. Three men have been indicted in the attack. ___ RIDE HAILING IN AUSTIN Ride-hailing giants Uber and Lyft, which left Texas's tech-savvy capital city a year ago over local fingerprint requirements for drivers, are set to return after state lawmakers intervened. Both companies say they'll be rolling on Austin's streets again Monday, when Gov. Greg Abbott is expected to sign into law a bill that puts the state — not local governments — in charge of regulating the ride-hailing industry. Uber and Lyft fled Austin after losing a bruising and expensive fight in 2016 to replace the city's ordinance that required fingerprint-based background checks of drivers, a variety of data reporting and other requirements. ___ QUOTE OF THE DAY "Slim to none." — Sen. Larry Taylor, R-Friendswood on the hopes of a last-day revival of a school finance bill that includes the so-called "bathroom bill" and voucher provisions.

Casting to NVIDIA SHIELD TV now supports 5.1 Surround Sound in some apps and 4K YouTube at 60fps Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/05/19 4:17am PDTMay 19, 2017 35 Plus 1 on G+ 33 Share on Facebook 54 Share on Twitter Total Shares122 News NVIDIA SHIELD NVIDIA's SHIELD TV is one of the best Android TV set-top boxes on the market (though the competition isn't that heated threr), but it's also quickly becoming one of the best overall video set-top boxes, even with Roku, Amazon, and Apple in the game. It was only a couple of weeks ago that the SHIELD TV added 4K streaming from Google Play Movies, and now it's announcing a couple of other improvements to its casting feature. A new Google Cast Receiver update has opened up new capabilities to the SHIELD TV and NVIDIA was quick to jump on board and verify they all work as intended. These are: 5.1 Surround Sound when casting from Netflix, Google Play Movies, VUDU, and Plex, Smooth 4K 60fps playback when casting from YouTube. NVIDIA was bragging nice enough to provide a new comparison chart for casting capabilities between its SHIELD TV and the Roku Ultra and Fire TV. The head-to-head doesn't do either of those any justice, proving how far behind they are in supporting several sources. However, if I'm not mistaken, this is a look at the "casting" functionality only, which is the ability to send or mirror something from your phone to the TV, and it doesn't say anything about local apps for directly streaming through these set-top boxes. The difference might not be as dramatic in that regard, but it is telling that Android TV (and SHIELD by extent) really make it easy to move from the small screen on your phone to the large screen on your TV with little hassle and without losing on options and quality.

It just needs a YouTube TV app and I'll be all set. Ishimaru It needs a better YouTube app, is what you mean. Duder12 Both. LethalLunatic I've never used it but cant you cast to it like Chromecast? newtonfb I meant the tv streaming service but it also needs an updated Youtube app which is already in development as we saw from I/O. I wish they would just make it one combined app enoch861 ShieldTV. The only device that keeps giving. The thing came out in what, 2015? And 2 years later it's still receiving new features. thespacecowboy I think it just shows 1) how good the hardware was and 2) how committed NVIDIA are to the platform Kellijerickson Google is paying 97$ per hour!

C64 I wanna bed that it will get Android O too enoch861 It's definitely getting Android O. Ammar Shield TV is awesome. The Bluetooth remote is fucking useless though. Greggs Cell How so? Since that's all I have are 2 controllers, and for almost 2 years have used them all day ,every day. Exactly why are they "****ing useless" as you so eloquently put it? I'll bet you don't have one. *sniff* *sniff* I smell troll. GinAndMiskatonic He said the remote, nothing of the controllers. I agree with him that the actual remote is pretty terrible. Def Ref Greggs is a troll with rage issues as illustrated by his barkings on this thread as he attacks the author for not discussing irrelevant features. Yes, the remote is terrible - pure Apple-style fashion over function. I was so glad to discover the SHIELD has an IR receiver allowing control with my Harmony remote which is superior in every way and even better than the implementation Roku has with their remote. (e.g. tapping FFWD or REW in YouTube app skips 10 seconds and holding it down zips down the timeline.) The only time I use the remote is for voice searching and that's like once every few months. So glad it was free with the SHIELD when I bought it. If I'd paid $50 I would've been punching random puppies. Greggs Cell Oops, I read it wrong, sorry dude OligarchyAmbulance My remote has made me rage for months, and Nvidia just sent me a replacement this week. It's 10000% better, though still not quite perfect. I highly recommend talking to their support and see if you can get a new one. William Worlde Oh, I hadn't seen this before I posted above; will try this. William Worlde And on that note, is there an issue with the remote control's CR2032 batteries?! They seem to run down really quickly! I mean, REALLY quickly to the point of making the remote ineffective and quite useless - even with the latest software. William Worlde Oh, one more thing, as a poster below noted using a 3rd party RC. I rediscovered yesterday that my Samsung TV remote does a fine job with the Shield box. I had forgotten I had set up my existing TV RC to work with the box when I got it. I guess I just wanted to use the sleek, new toy. Anyway, the Samsung RC does all the Shield's RC does - and just as effectively. Now, all's I have to do is figure out how to stop a frigging movie/episode from starting to run when I'm just sitting at its info page reading (or becoming distracted with something else) - if that's even possible! It's extremely annoying! (My MyGica never did that.) Paul Lefebvre Harmony remote works with it too. I have the Harmony Hub and it integrates perfectly with the Shield. Ammar My Samsung TV remote also works with the Shield TV, EXCEPT the home button. The home button on the TV remote triggers the TV's home button action instead of the Shield TV. SyCoREAPER Who cares about casting if you have an actual remote. That chart means nothing when there are dedicated apps for each. Alexis Urena To say the Shield TV is the best set-top box is doing it a dis-service. The competition is pretty much non existent. Plus the level of support for this thing is unparalleled in the age of smart phones being replaced at a higher clip than the manufacturer updates the software on them. RaiDei Exactly. I balked at the $200 price tag at first, but after owning one for over a year, I kinda feel like I owe Nvidia more money, lol. C64 I waisted more then 200 bucks on 3 Chinese Android boxes / sticks (mk808, mxq 805 x2) and a raspberry pi3 before i bought my Shield TV. I always thought it was way to expensive, but it's worth every penny. In combination with the Chromecast 2 in my bedroom it's a perfect combination. CrazySurfaNZ Why do you need shield tv and a chromecast? Greggs Cell In her hurry to be snarky, and "oh so cool", this "journalist" forgot to mention that the Shield is the only Android streamer that supports Amazon Prime. And she also forgot to mention the G Force gaming aspect of this machine, which is a big selling point. I kind of doubt that she even touched one of these Nvidia Shields, let alone actually used one. I think she just read other's reviews and decided that was good enough. Evan Jenkins Troll harder bro Greggs Cell I can't stand it when so called journalists write about things they obviously don't know much about. This is an awesome machine, the best thing I've bought in the last couple years. So if that's "trolling", then, "get off my bridge!" :) Tom Westrick It's almost like those aren't relevant to today's announcement Greggs Cell I kind of think they are, but, maybe not the gaming, the Amazon Prime definitely is relevant though. Def Ref No, it's not because this story is about update to the Google Cast Receiver, not what apps are built into the SHIELD, and Amazon Video currently does not support casting in any form. (No, mirroring your device screen does not count.) Your trollery is like attacking a news story about the fuel economy of a car for not addressing how great the stereo sounds and how big the cup holders are. dizel123 I love how you say it doesn't support casting in any form, then say how the one form that is supported doesn't count, then say he's the one who's trolling. Def Ref Spare me your pedantic trollery, troll. Mirroring your screen isn't casting in the normal sense because the device is now locked into casting the screen and can't do anything else. Everyone who isn't a pedantic troll being trolly knows that mirroring is a kludge trotted out by trolls to be all neener-neener children. Hey, you can get an HDMI adapter and hook your phone to your TV and display the screen that way and while jerks like you will say that counts as casting, it's not. But you know this; you're just being a troll, troll. dizel123 using an HDMI adapter definitely isn't casting. Only someone who doesn't know what casting is(based on your comments I'm guessing that includes you) would think that Mirroring your screen was initially the only way to cast most things since there weren't many apps supporting casting when it first came out. Mirroring is the original casting, saying it doesn't count is foolish at best. And are you a 10 year old who just got a new thesaurus? That's what your comment makes you look like. Next time look up your words first so you can use them properly. Def Ref I'm wasting time making an example of you, but your ilk need to be put down on sight. As you well know - but are pretending to not understand because you are a sad pathetic loser who trolls your betters on the Internet because your allowance doesn't afford you the ability to pay a dominatrix IRL to spank and humiliate you, so you try to get your fix from strangers online - the way casting works NOW in PROPER APPS is that your phone is still able to function in other aspects while the program is playing on the TV. (e.g. you start your stream of Barney and Friends and then can go to the Pokemon fan art site on your phone to fap to erotic Squirtle drawings) For Amazon, while you can start your episode of Bubble Guppies or Dora the Explorer on your phone, after you've mirrored your screen, where are you? You can't simultaneously read your Harry Potter slash-fic site to see how Ron and Harry are doing now that Ron has divorced Hermione and come out of the closet. You can't go to eBay to order a new vibrator to replace the one that broke in half (and you never did find the other half). Nope, you're just stuff watching Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood exclusively. But it's worth it because you get to thump your tiny fist on your sunken chest at a stranger and squeal that mirroring = casting because that's the way it used to be and so yay you, right? Pfffft. dizel123 I know that to mirror my screen I tell my phone to cast it. That means it's casting, but you're too ignorant to understand that there can be more than one way of doing things. Maybe when I watch a movie I don't want to facebook or tweet about how I'm watching it, I want to...watch the movie. I know, your tiny little mind is blown by that idea. But your ignorance isn't surprising given your intimate knowledge of children's programming, indicating that your mental level is that of a child. I'm not sure how you're making an example of me. If your idea is to demonstrate an example of someone more intelligent than you, you literally could pick anyone who has ever been on the internet. But I guess I should feel flattered that you picked me. As far as me trolling, well that's a typical response when someone points out how wrong someone else is they are immediately called a troll. And trolling my betters? The only thing you are better at is naming and describing kiddie shows. But that vibrator story sounds very much like its written from personal experience. I hope it isn't because your mom will be pretty upset that you're going thru her stuff again. She told you to stop wearing her underwear. But don't worry, she won't give you a spanking. You enjoyed it too much last time. Def Ref Blah-blah-woof-woof. Have a grown-up who's not foaming at the mouth explain to you how a pedant isn't something you put on a necklace. dizel123 If I didn't already know what the word meant I would have a grown up explain it to me because I definitely can't ask a know-nothing kid like you to do it Andy Roid Mirroring your screen leads to shitty quality and is in no way equivalent to casting from.a supported app Greggs Cell No, you are wrong, Amazon Prime video IS supported and casts (not mirroring) quite well. It has for a few months now... Do YOU HAVE A SHIELD? Seems all you want to do is call people names, my 10 y/o nephew does that too. Def Ref I'm not sure what the big deal is about this since aren't most of these apps already available in native app form on the SHIELD? Why would people be casting from their phones instead of using the app UI and a remote control other than perhaps they didn't have the remote? If anything the chart sells the actual native apps short because there is currently no way to cast Amazon Video (no, screen mirroring doesn't count) to any Google/Chromecast device while Nvidia was able to make a deal to have full 4K HDR Amazon Video on it as of January, something that Amazon's own Fire TV can't deliver. AuroraFlux If I come across a YouTube link that i want to watch, it'll most likely be sent to me in the form of a message or on a site like this one. If It's either of those, that means that I already have the link up in front of me on my phone or my computer. Why would I open up the YouTube app on my shield TV, search for some keywords, find the exact video, and watch it that way, when I can simply hit one button on my desktop or my phone and send the direct link to the video straight to my Shield? Before, if I wanted to watch a video in all its glory, I had to do just that, even though the video was right in front of me, on my phone, ready to play. Now, I don't have to. Def Ref Sure, but I was thinking more along the lines of when you're sitting there grazing for stuff to watch. Your YouTube example is a specific exception; no one is sending you links to Netflix or Vudu, I'd surmise. Personally, I'd probably hit the link sent me to fire up YouTube and then go to my History to view it that way so I'd still be on the SHIELD when I was done with the sent link and not have to dig back. Just my preference. (I also have a Vizio SmartCast TV so I'd be casting directly to that, though it may be capped to 30 fps; need to check. There's a firmware bug which makes some 4K content cap at 1080p.) makapav There are different use cases and you now have to acknowledge the other one as well which is just as important. Def Ref What are you talking about? Even my initial post made an allowance for a possible reason to want this functionality, but those are exceptions. It'd be like Roku announcing all these casting options when they have all the channels/apps on the device. Why not just get a Chromecast Ultra for $80 (which adds YouTube HDR which no other device and very few smart TVs offer) and save the $120 more a SHIELD TV costs if you're just going to cast from your phone. (Here's where someone swings in to talk about GeForce Now and other gameing uses.) AuroraFlux If your goal was simply to watch 4K content and do nothing else, yes, it might be a better buy for a Chromecast ultra. If you wan to do more than that, have access to interactive Android TV apps, play games, use the NVidia gamestreaming platform, or do what I do, which is use Kodi with local content (I don't do any illicit streaming and I don't use any "plugins" or "repos"), and on top of all of that, you still wanted standard Chromecast functionality (such as audio casting and video casting from anyone else), there is no contest, you buy a Shield TV. > (Here's where someone swings in to talk about GeForce Now and other gameing uses.) Honestly, I don't know what your problem is, you're getting kind of needlessly aggressive; no one is claiming the Shield TV is a universally mainstream device with mass appeal for everyone. If you have a certain set of use cases, a Shield TV is the best Android TV option that you can possibly have. Otherwise, most people would be just fine with a Chromecast or a TV with AndroidTV or Cast built in. Andy Roid What legal local content are you streaming on kodi? Def Ref >"I'm sorry, do you even own a Shield TV? There is no "digging back". If you use the Cast protocol to send something to an Android TV that is doing something else, the moment the cast completes (whether the content is done playing or the user exits it), you are automatically returned to EXACTLY where you left off." Yes, I do and I was about to open my response to acknowledge just this thing precisely when I noticed you'd mentioned it here (hadn't seen this post then). I was watching something on VLC player and got an email on my phone with a YouTube link. Since we'd been discussing just this sort of use scenario, I tried casting it to the TV and when I killed the cast, I was surprised to see it dropped right back to VLC. I genuinely did not know this is how this worked and am happy to admit I stand corrected. Thanks. >"Honestly, I don't know what your problem is, you're getting kind of needlessly aggressive" I'm just annoyed at how so many people are so desperate to be pedantic trolls that they blaze right over ALL the words I write, which make a nod to different use cases, in order to find some sliver I didn't address to be jerks about whatever. Your prior response is of a piece - you took what I wrote, twisted it into the worst-possible pretzel and then attacked it as if I was dissing the SHIELD TV. I own a SHIELD TV and am well aware of its features even if I don't use half of them like the the subscription streaming or even compatible Android titles. (I've got a brawny gaming PC, X360, XBone, PS3 and PS4 and a backlog of games that would take YEARS to put a dent into.) It's a terrific box, but too spendy and specific in it's power set for most users. Nvidia should consider offering a "basic" model without the gamepad for $130-$150 to compete against the Roku Ultra. I'm just bored of the trolls who crap up the Internet with garbage like, "Uhn-uhn! You can cast Amazon! I win!" when they're talking about screen mirroring or run away when called out to prove it's possible without kludges, hacks, extra hardware, etc. AuroraFlux > Sure, but I was thinking more along the lines of when you're sitting there grazing for stuff to watch. If I was sitting there "grazing for stuff to watch", yes, I'd be doing it in the interactive app. I don't know what this even means. You asked this: > Why would people be casting from their phones instead of using the app UI and a remote control other than perhaps they didn't have the remote? I gave you a reason why you'd be casting instead of using app UI, you just don't seem to like the fact it's quite a legitimate reason. > Personally, I'd probably hit the link sent me to fire up YouTube and then go to my History to view it that way This sounds horribly inefficient, and almost foolish. If I got sent a link to YouTube and wanted to see it on the screen, I can hit one button to watch it without all of these gymnastics. > so I'd still be on the SHIELD when I was done with the sent link and not have to dig back I'm sorry, do you even own a Shield TV? There is no "digging back". If you use the Cast protocol to send something to an Android TV that is doing something else, the moment the cast completes (whether the content is done playing or the user exits it), you are automatically returned to EXACTLY where you left off. > (I also have a Vizio SmartCast TV so I'd be casting directly to that, though it may be capped to 30 fps; need to check. There's a firmware bug which makes some 4K content cap at 1080p.) And this sort of demonstrates exactly why I'd rather use a Shield TV for my "smart" functionality. I'd rather buy a Shield TV with a consistent, powerful, and constantly upgraded/supported software version and then spend my money on a TV that has a fantastic quality panel instead of any "smart" gimmicks. I think this is something you haven't quite understood; the "best in class" product isn't always the product that EVERYONE should be. For many people (I'd even argue most people), a Shield TV is absolute overkill and isn't necessary. But for those who have certain desired use cases, it simply is the absolute best product for them, and I really don't understand why it upsets or confuses you so much that those niche users (such as myself) are getting a genuinely useful feature that makes our purchase even more extensible and flexible than before. Just take a deep breath, and take a step back; there's a lot of perspective here to be gained by simply thinking in shoes that are not yours. Bryan Breguet So wait, it didn't do 5.1 with Netflix until now? Is that a joke? Drakenoid They're talking about casting not apps. makapav Even now the inbuilt Netflix and YouTube Android apps do not output 5.1 sound. Ammar Netflix app supports 5.1. Works just fine on my setup. Jeff While 4K 60fps is nice, YouTube still only outputs 2.0 stereo sound. For shame... Ammar Does youtube output 5.1 anywhere? Curious. enoch861 Nope. YouTube doesn't support multi-channel audio. And I doubt they'll support it since a majority of the content on their is 2 channel anyway and probably wouldn't benefit from anything more than a center channel. Also a majority of YouTube consumption is on devices that don't need multi-channel audio (eg, your phone/tablet). Abhimanyu Seth (though the competition isn't that heated threr) "threr"? Paul Lefebvre I have one and absolutely love it. My only frustration is that when casting, it seems to occasionally pause. YaKillaCJ I notice the Xiaomi MiBox missing from the chart.

The $217 billion spending bill sent to Republican Gov. Greg Abbott will likely be a quiet footnote to a rancorous legislative session that ends Monday — upended by a "bathroom bill" targeting transgender people and an immigration crackdown on so-called "sanctuary cities." The tensions simmered into the final weekend as Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, Apple CEO Tim Cook and a dozen other tech industry giants sent a letter to Abbott on Saturday that again urged him to abandon a so-called bathroom bill. "Such laws are bad for employees and bad for business," the letter read. Democrats, teachers and advocates for Texas' poor warned that the lean new budget for a booming state — which boasts four of the five fastest-growing large cities in the U.S. — will have lasting consequences. Deepening the wound, they say, is the Legislature leaving $11 billion untouched. But a staunchly conservative wing of the Texas Republican Party that's growing in size and influence made their presence on the budget felt. Led by GOP Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, an evangelical former conservative talk radio host, the Senate resisted calls from Republican House moderates to use more emergency savings to offset an oilfield slowdown and funnel more money to classrooms. ___ GUNS ON SCHOOL PROPERTY Texas lawmakers voted to allow handgun permit holders to have guns in their parked cars outside schools. The Senate gave final approval to the measure, sending it to Gov. Greg Abbott for his consideration. The vote came a day after Abbott signed into law a sharp decrease in fees paid to obtain a handgun license. The bill allowing guns in parked cars at schools is aimed at teachers and school workers who want to keep their weapons in their vehicles without violating state law. Opponents worry it raises the potential for danger if a car is burglarized on school property. ___ PROTECTING JUDGES Texas will beef up security for judges under a bill signed into law by Gov. Greg Abbott after an Austin judge was wounded but survived an alleged assassination attempt. The bill requires the state to set up a special judicial security division and allows personal security for state judges who have been threatened or attacked. Court security officers will get special training and the law restricts release of personal information of current and former judges. Saturday's bill signing was attended by State District Judge Julie Kocurek, who was wounded by a gunman in an ambush outside her home in 2015. After a long hospital stay and multiple surgeries, she has returned to the bench. Three men have been indicted in the attack. ___ RIDE HAILING IN AUSTIN Ride-hailing giants Uber and Lyft, which left Texas's tech-savvy capital city a year ago over local fingerprint requirements for drivers, are set to return after state lawmakers intervened. Both companies say they'll be rolling on Austin's streets again Monday, when Gov. Greg Abbott is expected to sign into law a bill that puts the state — not local governments — in charge of regulating the ride-hailing industry. Uber and Lyft fled Austin after losing a bruising and expensive fight in 2016 to replace the city's ordinance that required fingerprint-based background checks of drivers, a variety of data reporting and other requirements. ___ QUOTE OF THE DAY "Slim to none." — Sen. Larry Taylor, R-Friendswood on the hopes of a last-day revival of a school finance bill that includes the so-called "bathroom bill" and voucher provisions. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

The $217 billion spending bill sent to Republican Gov.

FILE - In this March 24, 2017, file photo, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott talks to reporters outside the White House in Washington. A proposed Texas "bathroom bill" targeting transgender people neared collapse Friday, May 26, 2017, over a deadlock. Republican Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said he is resolved to force a special session if a North Carolina-style law that could restrict bathroom access for transgender people doesn't prevail - but Abbott made clear later that he was calling the shots. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File) "Such laws are bad for employees and bad for business," the letter read. Democrats, teachers and advocates for Texas' poor warned that the lean new budget for a booming state - which boasts four of the five fastest-growing large cities in the U.S. - will have lasting consequences. Deepening the wound, they say, is the Legislature leaving $11 billion untouched. But a staunchly conservative wing of the Texas Republican Party that's growing in size and influence made their presence on the budget felt. Led by GOP Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, an evangelical former conservative talk radio host, the Senate resisted calls from Republican House moderates to use more emergency savings to offset an oilfield slowdown and funnel more money to classrooms. The rift between GOP factions in the House and Senate has now erupted in the final weekend over a "bathroom bill" and threatens to thrust the Legislature into a special session. Abbott, who unlike other GOP governors nationwide has welcomed possible bathroom restrictions for transgender people, gave no indication Saturday whether the he might keep lawmakers in Austin. Despite the tensions, the budget overwhelmingly cleared both the House and Senate, and Republicans in both chambers praised it as responsible belt-tightening in the face of slumping energy prices. One of the few bipartisan areas of consensus was a half-billion dollars in new money for Texas' beleaguered child welfare system. "Our economy continued to prosper, but the price of oil fell," said Republican Sen. Jane Nelson, the Senate budget chief. "We took steps to prepare for a tough budget cycle." A glaring exception is border security. Two years after Texas nearly tripled state spending on patrolling the U.S.-Mexico border, and railed against then-President Barack Obama over the need to do so, Republicans are not letting up despite President Donald Trump's vow to build a wall between the two countries. Without mentioning Trump by name, GOP House budget chairman John Zerwas said "we cannot count on federal assistance at this time." Democrats blasted the deployment of another 250 troopers and round-the-clock border patrols as unnecessary and criticized those expenditures over not fully restoring Medicaid cuts to therapy services for children with disabilities. Parents of children with speech delays, autism and other disabilities have pleaded with lawmakers since 2015 to reverse $350 million in cuts that were defended as a cost-saving measure. House Republicans wanted to restore 75 percent of the cuts, but the Senate resisted that reversal as well, agreeing to restore only 25 percent. Conservatives also balked at a school finance overhaul despite the Texas Supreme Court last year declaring the current state system flawed, albeit still constitutional. Slashing first-time handgun licenses fees from $140 to $40, meanwhile, is expected to cost Texas more than $20 million over the next five years. "In retrospect, I probably shouldn't have voted for a single budget since I arrived in Austin six years ago," Dallas Democratic state Rep. Eric Johnson said. ___ Follow Paul J.

Dan Patrick holds a news conference at the Republican Party of Texas Headquarters, in Austin, Texas. A proposed Texas "bathroom bill" targeting transgender people neared collapse Friday, May 26, 2017. Patrick said he is resolved to force a special session if a North Carolina-style law that could restrict bathroom access for transgender people doesn't prevail.

Shutterstock?Roger Jegg Fotodesign Jegg.de Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger First developed almost three decades ago, the MP3 format made large digital audio files relatively small and easy to pass across an internet that was largely accessed via a very slow (by today’s standards) phone dial-up connection. Now the companies behind the file compression format, Technicolor and Fraunhofer IIS, have decided to end their support for the licensing program for MP3. The last patent for the tech format is due to expire at the end of the year. So the MP3 is dead. Again. Or is it? What is MP3? MP3 is a form of codec, a way of compressing (co) and decompressing (dec) the data in audio files. The organisation responsible for defining the standards for audio and video compression and decompression is the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG), a working group of several authorities. So MP3 is just short for MPEG-1, Audio Layer 3. The development of MP3. Full resolution digital audio files are relatively large, around 10MB per minute of stereo, CD-quality sound. Today, streaming 10MB/minute might seem trivial but in the early days of digitally transferred data it was a lot. MP3s were initially developed with the goal of a 12:1 compression ratio achieving acceptable sound quality. A 60MB song could therefore be compressed into a 5MB file. Other compression ratios can be used, with higher ratios yielding more obvious sonic artefacts (unwanted sounds) and lower ratios resulting in higher file sizes. Hear the quality (or not) of MP3 compression at different bit rates. A “lossy” compression codec works on the theory that, as the human ear is already discarding a lot of information in the perception of sound, you might as well simply not encode this redundant information. The term lossy comes from the fact that this data is lost, discarded and gone forever. MP3 and rivals AAC (Advanced Audio Coding) and WMA (Windows Media Audio) are all lossy formats. The audio that gets edited out in MP3 compression, in this case from Suzanne Vega’s version of Tom’s Diner. Conversely, lossless compression reduces file sizes, but does not reduce quality. Something like a compressed zip file is an example of lossless compression. Uncompressed files are a straight 1:1 transfer of the digital file. MP3: dead or alive? Developed in the late 1980s and standardised in the early 1990s, MP3 was first pronounced dead in 1995 and nearly abandoned as a technology. It was deemed commercially unsuccessful despite heavy investment from the Fraunhofer institute and a decade’s development by the project’s leader Karlheinz Brandenburg. It was the victim of a format war, led by Dutch manufacturer Philips. Fraunhofer’s MP3 was consistently overlooked in the early 1990s by the MPEG standards group in favour of Philips’ MP2. The MP3 format only found early commercial success in the sports broadcast market, with the compressed digital audio saving broadcasters thousands in satellite transmission costs. So deeply unpopular was MP3 in commercial music applications that the developers effectively gave it away for free. As a result, the format was close to being abandoned by its developers again towards the end 1996, in favour of the AAC format still patented and supported today. The AAC format was developed initially by the same team behind the MP3, in part as a way to circumnavigate technical limitations imposed by Phillips on the MPEG-1 standard. AAC generally performs better than MP3 at higher compression ratios, and the patent does not require a user to obtain a license to stream or distribute AAC encoded audio. Listen carefully to the cymbals. It was only the proliferation of filesharing internet sites, built around the distribution of pirated content, that revived interest in the MP3, first as isolated “warez” sites, and then as peer-to-peer networks such as Napster. Stephen Witt’s 2015 book How Music Got Free (a source for much of this history) says that the first time the term MP3 was used by mainstream press was May 1997, with a USA Today article detailing how college students were uploading bootlegged albums onto university servers via file sharing sites. By this stage, the first time most people had even heard of the MP3 format, the horse had already bolted, and the music industry would never be the same again. The first portable MP3 player, the MPMan, debuted less than a year later, and Apple’s move into the market in 2001, through the release of iTunes and the iPod, cemented the ubiquity of both compact music players and compressed digital formats. Music sharing Early MP3s didn’t sound great and were generally disliked by audiophiles and record producers alike. But they allowed consumers to stockpile music to an extent that had not been possible before, heralding a new relationship between digital information and ownership. A market model based on scarcity had been turned on its head. While copying music had been around for decades, each copy was physically coupled to the medium – a vinyl record or magnetic tape cassette, for instance. The rise of peer-to-peer file sharing networks, most famously Napster, meant that now anyone with a computer and internet connection could access another person’s entire music collection. A single file could by copied by thousands, all at the same time. This changed listening patterns: instead of buying perhaps one album per month (depending on what you could afford), and then listening to it several times, music fans could constantly scour the internet for new music. Some would even stockpile music that they would never even listen to. From share to stream Today, playing MP3 files is increasingly being superseded by the ubiquity of streaming services. With fast and cheap access to mobile internet, services such as Spotify, Apple Music, Google Play and others now all offer extensive music libraries that can be accessed for a subscription fee. Just one of several online music options. Presciently, Brandenburg’s mentor, Dieter Sietzer, had suggested as early as 1982 that the most effective delivery of digital audio was through streaming, as a way to make use of Germany’s new digital telephone lines. His patent was refused. If it was the increase in portable MP3 players and the proliferation of pirated content that cemented the role of the MP3 in youth culture, it is the rise of streaming services that define current habits. Despite Fraunhofer’s termination of its licensing program for the MP3 format, the MP3 file will continue to live on, unsupported by the developers, but now unrestricted by patents or licences. While better codecs now exist for compressing digital music files, it’s interesting to note the revival of the old format of vinyl. Today, events such as Classic Album Sundays are emerging as an attempt to reclaim focused listening experiences through the use of analogue technologies that have been nominally obsolete since the late 1980s. I believe it very unlikely that similar listening parties will develop in an attempt to celebrate the early MP3.

The company has introduced a set of smartphone-based devices that would allow healthcare providers to take photos of the human retina. Figure 1 – Retinal examination performed with oDocs visoscope, a smartphone retinal camera. An award winning mobile innovation was launched by a oDocs Eye Care, a New Zealand based social enterprise. The company has introduced a set of smartphone-based devices that would allow healthcare providers to take photos of the human retina. The company has promised to keep the inventions open-source, one of the very few altruistic motive to ensure that the products remain affordable and accessible. Furthermore, for every item sold, ten percent (10%) of the profit will be donated to a charity for sight. oDocs is the brainchild of Dunedin Hospital-based ophthalmology registrar Dr. Hong Sheng Chiong and Dr. Benjamin O’Keeffe, senior house office of Ophthalmology department at Wellington Hospital. The social enterprise started this bold and ambitious project in 2014 and it took them 3 years of hard work and perseverance to materialise the innovations. In May 2017, The New Zealand Hi-Tech Awards have just named oDocs Eye Care as New Zealand’s Most Innovative Mobile Technology company. The company has won numerous international awards including the prestigious Talent Unleashed Award judged by Sir Richard Branson, and Steve Wozniak. “This is how disruption is done” said Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple. Dr. Hong and his team have developed a smartphone retinal imaging adapter, also known as visoScope. When attached to an iPhone, the device converts the phone into a retinal camera. oDocs have also released a smartphone slit lamp microscope called visoClip. “We have made them extremely affordable and accessible to benefit regions most in need. Conventional equipment would cost around US$ 20000 – 30000, whereas our devices cost a hundredth of that.” Said Dr. Hong. The open-source devices are also compatible with 3D printing and additive manufacturing. Clinicians could just download the files from the web and 3D print the eye equipment locally, saving both cost and time from a logistic perspective.

Samsung Hopes Galaxy S8 Will Revive Its Fortunes in Japanese Market Facebook 0 Twitter 0 E-mail More Google+ LinkedIn KakaoStory May 29, 2017 10:55 Samsung will launch its Galaxy S8 in Japan early next month. The electronics giant initially released the new premium smartphone in about 150 countries at the end of April. Japan is the last country in which it is being rolled out. Apple's iPhone has a strong grip on the Japanese smartphone market, with a more than 50 percent share, compared to a mere 3.4 percent for Samsung, which ranks fifth after Sony, Fujitsu, and Sharp. Samsung hopes to start turning this around with the release of the Galaxy S8. Visitors to Samsung's studio in Tokyo, Japan try out Galaxy S8 smartphones last week. /Courtesy of Samsung Samsung last week opened a studio in Omotesando, a major luxury shopping destination in central Tokyo, for people to test its latest gadgets including the Galaxy S8, and the Gear camera and virtual reality headset. It plans to open more studios across the country this year. The Galaxy S8 series is selling twice as fast as the S6 and S7, with sales surpassing 1 million in Korea in just over a month since its release.  Copyright © Chosunilbo & Chosun.com Previous Next All Headlines Back to Top
