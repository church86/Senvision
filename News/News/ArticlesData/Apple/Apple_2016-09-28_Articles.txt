The bad news? It can’t make enough of those things to ship to everyone quick enough. So, if rumors of an all-glass iPhone next year come to bear, will Apple step up to meet the demand — if there is any? We’ve got plenty of questions to mull over and twelve whole months to do so, but let’s start with more about the all-glass design for what may be the iPhone 8 next year. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has another research note out today. AppleInsider reports that just as Apple has limited the new Jet Black option to the 128GB and 256GB storage options of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, the company may go in the same direction again next year. Part of that may relate to the desire to achieve an all-glass chassis for the iPhone 8. Kuo believes that there won’t be enough R&D progress to make such a phone structurally sound. “[A] metal frame surrounding the edge is necessary for reinforced structure design,” Kuo stated. “As stainless steel has a better look than aluminum and costs more, we expect only high-end new iPhone models to come with a stainless steel frame next year.” Unlike this year’s easily marked Jet Black finish, though, the all-glass design will be just as glossy while being more resistant to scratches. Kuo also rumors that the mostly glass build will be on both the iPhone 8 and the iPhone 8 Plus next year, contradicting the notion that just the Plus models would be getting it. We also may expect an edge-to-edge OLED display that will completely cover the face of certain, if not all iPhones. The home button, earpiece and the FaceTime camera might actually be tucked beneath the screen. Just what kind of research has Kuo and KGI been up to? We don’t know. The firm has called plenty of shots correctly, though it missed on a few major ones before. We’d like to see if these rumors make it past the spring, though.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple 10 Must-Read Tricks for Mastering Your New iPhone John Patrick Pullen TimeSeptember 29, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share When Apple introduced its 3D Touch feature last year with the iPhone 6s, it didn’t exactly become a huge ‘screen saver.’ Not many developers had advance access to the feature, which enables new app interactions based on how hard a user presses his or her iPhone’s screen. Eventually apps caught up, but the iPhone’s operating system itself still didn’t get the much out of the pressure-sensitive input. That has now changed with Apple’s new iOS 10, which makes much better use out of the iPhone 6s and iPhone 7’s 3D Touch feature. But these invisible shortcuts can be hard to find without poking at the screen constantly. Here’s a list of some of the more useful and popular tips and tricks. Feel the (Apple) Music Apple Music’s first incarnation was criticized as needlessly complex. Thankfully, a revision in iOS 10 has made it much easier to use. If you have an iPhone 6s or iPhone 7, it gets even simpler through the use of 3D Touch. By pressing down on albums and tracks, a master menu pops up, providing quick access to features like adding tracks to your library or playlists or looking up lyrics. Take Control of the Control Panel Swiping up from the bottom of your iPhone’s home screen brings the Control Panel to the forefront. (It’s the place you go to put your iPhone in airplane mode or turn on the flashlight.) Pressing harder on the Flashlight, Timer, Calculator, and Camera buttons reveal a bunch of options for fine-tuning your phone. For instance, you can set the torch to a dimmer setting, set a one-minute timer without opening the clock app, quickly copy the figure on the calculator, or pull the camera up in video mode without all the extra taps. Give Facebook the Finger Facebook can be a total timesuck when it comes to productivity. You open it to make a quick post, and 25 minutes later you, you realize you’ve just looked through all your ex’s recent vacation photos. By pressing extra hard on the Facebook app icon, 3D Touch can help you avoid the News Feed and simply write a post or upload a photo. Make the Camera a Snap to Use Even though smartphones put cameras in everyone’s hands, it can still be hard to capture the moment. Using 3D Touch on the Camera app icon pulls up a quick action menu that vaults the camera into the selfie, video, slow-motion or plain old photo mode with only one tap. Stop Apps From Being Downloaded We’ve all been there, held hostage by a trickle of Internet bandwidth while a massive app tries to update itself. Previously you had to dive deep into the App Store to put that download on hold. With 3D Touch, pausing a download is as easily as prodding the app icon. And not only can you cut the install short, you can also tell your iPhone to download one particular app first — a lifesaver when you’ve got a screen full of updates hogging all your data. Watch Your Widgets Pushed to the forefront of iOS 10, widgets are small versions of apps made ready for quick viewing. In Apple’s newest operating system, they’re typically found by swiping the home or lock screen to the right — something that confused many iPhone fans used to “swipe to unlock.” But widgets can also be found by using 3D Touch on the icon of many apps. This can be a time saver for those moments when you want a quick peek at information. Try it out by pressing the Weather icon extra hard, and rather than opening the app fully, you’ll see the Weather widget. Be a Major Netflix Player The heart wants what it wants — unless the Netflix algorithm tells you that you want something else. To stay focused while pulling up your latest binge-watching series, push the Netflix app icon a little harder than usual. This will pull up a quick action menu that can catapult you into your list of favorite shows, display trending videos, or let you pick up your most recent program right where you left off. Nix Your Notifications 3D Touch and Apple’s notifications are a potent mix of information. The “peek and pop” capability of the feature lets users quickly dive into alerts that flash on their screen without losing their place in their phone. But you can also use 3D Touch to push all your notifications out of the way – you just need to know what button to press. On the Notification panel (swipe down from the top of the screen), you’ll see an “X” button. When pressed, this button will clear your recent alerts, but when pushed harder, it gives you the option of deleting all the notifications on that panel. It’s a great way to keep your phone tidy. Read More Be a Speed Deleter Many iPhone users know that by holding down the delete button on a paragraph of text, eventually the cursor moves faster as it gobbles up unwanted words. But if you give the backspace key a little bit of pressure, it will delete unwanted text even faster than before. Shoot Through Your Settings The iOS Settings app is packed full of various system preferences — so much so that it’s difficult to find what you need in there. But by using 3D Touch on the Settings icon, users will find the big four — battery, cellular data, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth — all easy to access with a quick action menu available from the home screen. Just press down and tap on the one you want, and presto, you’re in control of some of your iPhone’s most important capabilities.

(Courtesy of Apple/Roy Zipstein) Following Apple's partnerships with IBM and SAP, the company just announced another joint effort with Deloitte, one of the largest professional services firms in the world and the leader in digital transformation strategy. Apple and Deloitte today announced a partnership to help companies quickly and easily transform the way they work by maximizing the power, ease-of-use and security the iOS platform brings to the workplace through iPhone and iPad. As part of the joint effort, Deloitte is creating a first-of-its-kind Apple practice with over 5,000 strategic advisors who are solely focused on helping businesses change the way they work across their entire enterprise, from customer-facing functions such as retail, field services and recruiting, to R&D, inventory management and back-office systems.  Apple and Deloitte will also collaborate on the development of a new service offering from Deloitte Consulting called EnterpriseNext, designed to help clients fully take advantage of the iOS ecosystem of hardware, software and services in the workplace. The new offering will help customers discover the highest impact possibilities within their industries and quickly develop custom solutions through rapid prototyping. “We know that iOS is the best mobile platform for business because we’ve experienced the benefit ourselves with over 100,000 iOS devices in use by Deloitte’s workforce, running 75 custom apps,” said Punit Renjen, CEO of Deloitte Global. “Our dedicated Apple practice will give global businesses the expertise and resources they need to empower their mobile workforce to take advantage of the powerful ecosystem iOS, iPhone and iPad offer, and help them achieve their ambitions, while driving efficiency and productivity.” “As the leader in digital transformation strategy, Deloitte is an ideal partner that brings a team of Apple-dedicated strategic advisors to help clients truly revolutionize how they work using iOS, iPhone and iPad,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “iPhone and iPad are transforming how people everywhere get work done. And through this partnership, we’re able to help even more businesses tap into the incredible capabilities that only the Apple ecosystem can deliver.” Gadjo Cardenas Sevilla | Post a Comment | Share Article Print Article Permalink tagged Apple and Deloitte, Parnership Email Article in Apple Beat, Apps & Launches, Enterprise, Events and Launches, Press release Reader Comments There are no comments for this journal entry.

Stock Bounces Back After China Concerns Wane (AAPL) Walt Disney Co’s Decline Is A Buying Opportunity (DIS) Recent Posts: Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Shares Slump As Sales Miss Estimates (WMT) Here’s Why Target Corporation is Still a Buy (TGT) Walt Disney Co’s Decline Is A Buying Opportunity (DIS) View All Posts Fitbit Inc (FIT) shares tanked on Thursday following a downgrade from analysts at Pacific Crest. Pacific Crest’s checks suggest that the new Charge 2 fitness wearable is off to a slow start, and they still believe that many people who have purchased a Fitbit stop using it within months of buying it. Needless to say, this presents a long-term problem for the fitness maker, although for now, Raymond James Financial, Inc. (RJF) analysts said on Wednesday that the company still owns the segment despite big gains by the Apple Watch. Is FIT Heading to $11? In a report dated September 28, Pacific Crest analyst Brad Erickson said he has downgraded Fitbit to “underweight” and sees downside to $11 per share. The company recently launched its new Charge 2 wearable, but Erickson’s checks with 15 big box retailers in the U.S. suggest that it isn’t going so well. The retailers his team spoke with said the Charge 2 is now in full distribution, but they have found “meaningful” accumulation of inventory in the channels. In fact, the analyst said they’re finding more than two weeks’ worth of inventory on hand. It’s unclear if Best Buy was one of the retailers Erickson spoke with, but you may recall that only a little over a month ago, the big box electronics chain was talking up demand for wearables. 5 Stocks to Sell for October He does expect sell-through to ramp as the holiday shopping season approaches, but run rates for the Charge 2 are lower than where the Blaze and Alta started out earlier this year. He views this as a disappointing start. After analyzing run rates and current inventory levels, he estimates that Fitbit shipped between 600,000 and 800,000 Charge 2 wearables during the third quarter. The analyst believes Fitbit could find growth to be difficult because of its core utility issue. He still believes “a large portion” of those who own one of the company’s devices stop using it within months of receiving it. Of course this is a very basic problem that results in a high churn rate, making it difficult for the company to find growth. Apple Threatens Fitbit Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Aetna Inc (AET) announced this week that they have struck a deal for the insurer to subsidize or purchase some Apple Watches for customers and employees. Of course this is a huge blow to Fitbit, which has been making headway through corporate partnerships. “That Apple can ink an exclusive deal without a truly mass market device is scary,” Erickson wrote in his report. “Imagine what Apple could do when (not if) it comes out with a $150-$200 fitness tracker, which we expect within the next year or two.” Here’s the Good News for Fitbit On Wednesday, Raymond James analyst Tavis McCourt had some positive news for Fitbit in the form of his firm’s recent survey about fitness wearables. He said the company still has a stranglehold on the wearable market in terms of purchasing intent, with 16% of respondents saying they intended to buy one, which is a new record. Also 14% of respondents already have one, which is also the highest reading ever. Last year those figures were 14% and 12%, respectively. However, McCourt also had some troubling findings regarding Apple, which is closing the gap with Fitbit. Just 2% of his survey’s respondents own an Apple Watch, and 9% plan to buy one. The concern here is that he has found a steady increase in purchase intent for the device, although thus far, that intent has not translated into purchases. The analyst expects a “meaningful uptick” in demand for the Apple Watch the year the company gets the wearable “right,” although it would seem that it hasn’t arrived yet. Apple Inc. (AAPL) Tracks Everyone You Chat With Apple did unveil the Series 2 models along with the iPhone 7 lineup, but so far the new iPhone has gotten all the attention (good and bad). Fitbit shares plunged by about 10% to as low as $14.97 during regular trading hours today, while Apple stock slipped by as much as 1.54% to $112.20 on a bearish report from Barclays.

 Apps are what killed the BlackBerry David Gilbert, VICE News Sep. 29, 2016, 8:06 PM 6,787 facebook linkedin twitter email print An illustrative photo shows Blackberry smartphone Thomson Reuters It was THE status symbol for anyone in the early 2000s, and its physical keyboard made it instantly recognizable, but now the BlackBerry is dead. But it wasn't the slowdown in the smartphone market or intense competition from Chinese companies which killed the BlackBerry, it was apps. When Apple released the iPhone in 2007, Microsoft's then CEO Steve Ballmer famously laughed at its chances. A decade later, Apple dominates and Microsoft is nowhere. But BlackBerry's announcement on Wednesday that it would not longer be making its own hardware, shows that it too completely missed just how important software, apps and the ecosystem surrounding them would be. BlackBerry has been making phones for 14 years but just like Nokia, the company failed to spot the significance of the introduction of the iPhone and subsequently Android smartphones from the likes of Samsung which now dominate the market. For a few years after the introduction of the touchscreen smartphone, BlackBerry continued to grow, but this was down to enterprise customers being tied into its platform and younger users who loved the free BlackBerry Messenger service But with the growth of apps likes Messenger, WhatsApp and dozens more, BlackBerry was losing its edge. Yes it retained its class-leading security, but as more and more people used their phones at home as well as work, the dearth of software and apps for BlackBerry's phones soon became a problem. Business Insider/Jeff Dunn At the height of its powers, almost a decade ago now, BlackBerry controlled 20 percent of the global mobile phone market, just behind Nokia. Today that figure stands at a fraction of 1 percent. BlackBerry's most recent attempt to keeps its hardware division alive was the launch of Android-based smartphones, including the Priv, which featured a physical keyboard, long the most recognisable aspect of the BlackBerry phones. But that was too little too late. "The company plans to end all internal hardware development and will outsource that function to partners. This allows us to reduce capital requirements and enhance return on invested capital," John Chen, BlackBerry CEO said in a statement accompanying the company's latest financial results. The company's stock price jumped more than 5 percent when the market opened on Wednesday following the announcement of the news as the company says it will focus on its growing software and services division. BlackBerry has not said when or if it will release any more devices bearing the iconic name which may be built by third parties, but if they do, they are likely to remain niche players in the market.

M Friday, Nov 18 2016 | Updated at 08:33 AM EST Stay Connected With Us F T R Opinion Academics Students Special Reports Sports Finance Tech Career College Video Sep 29, 2016 11:30 AM EDT By Anita Valencia, UniversityHerald Reporter Apple Rumor: iPad Mini 5 or iPad Pro Mini to Arrive alongside New iPad Pro Tablet - Debut in 2017 Apple iPad Mini new model could have a 2017 release date (Photo : Sean Gallup/Getty Images) iPad Mini 5 could be released alongside the new variant of iPad Pro 2 as predicted by a reliable analyst. Apple rumor: iPad Mini 5 new variant KGI analyst Ming Chi-Kuo has been the person that all media turns to, when it comes to Apple possible updates. Kuo, who has correctly predicted the iPhone 7, claims that a new iPad Pro variant, 10.5-inch screen, will debut in 2017. The model would be an up from the current 9.7 inch iPad Pro, Bloomberg wrote.   Kuo further explains that the new iPad Pro will have 10.5-inch and 12.9-inch models - both are said to get A10X chip, as University Herald has reported a few days ago. With that being said, the 9.7-inch iPad could likely belong to the Mini variant. For the record, the iPad Mini 4 that came in 2015 gets a 7.9-inch display. Apple could upgrade the tablet size along with expected features such as Retina display, a 3GB of RAM and 32 GB of storage. Apple rumor: iPad Mini 5 release date Kuo said that the major overhaul in iPads will not be seen until next year. This could mean that the public should expect the Macbook Pro 2016 released in October without any new iPad models. And since the iPad Mini 4 was launched a year ago, that would make sense to unveil a new product sometime in March 2017. As the major upgrades in iPad Pro include the AMOLED display, it can be argued that the iPad Mini 5 could also sport similar feature. Other than that, Apple is expected to upgrade the display technology - allowing a smoother navigation. Now that the possibility of iPad Mini 5 having a new size, many people question whether the model would get another name. Macworld has speculated that the upcoming 2017 tablet might be named as iPad Pro Mini given its A9X chip that is considered a lower specification.     Tags ipad pro mini, iPad Mini 5, apple rumor ipad mini, iPad Pro 2, ming chi kuo analyst © 2016 University Herald, All rights reserved.

With the update, which bumps the app to version 2.13.1365, iOS and Apple TV users can now watch their favorite content on their TV… First off, the update adds long-awaited support for AirPlay. This means that you can be watching something via the CW app on your iPhone or iPad and instantly send it to your Apple TV by tapping the new AirPlay icon in the app. But for fourth-gen Apple TV users, The CW has more in store… Today’s update also brings with it a brand new Apple TV app for tvOS. This eliminates the need for AirPlay entirely and allows you to simply browse content from The CW on the Apple TV itself. Interestingly, there’s no cable login or login of any sort required. So once you download the app from the tvOS App Store, you can instantly start watching the latest shows from The CW. The content is ad-supported, though, so that’s where revenue is coming from for the network. It’s unique that The CW is not requiring any sort of login to stream content. Generally, TV networks require a cable login in order to verify that you’re a paying cable TV subscriber. The CW, however, appears to have opted for an ad-supported streaming model, instead. Additionally, the CW app on iOS also added Chromecast support with today’s update. Now, you can stream content to your TV with Google’s affordable TV dongle, as well. The full changelog for the latest version of the CW app can be read below and the app can be downloaded from the App Store for free.

Photo: Hemant Mishra/Mint Bengaluru: Online marketplace Flipkart Internet Pvt. Ltd has lined up exclusive partnerships with key smartphone and television brands for its flagship Big Billion Day sale, a move that may give a leg-up to the company in its market share war with arch-rival Amazon India next month. Flipkart’s big smartphone wins include Samsung’s Galaxy On8, Motorola’s E3 Power and Xiaomi’s Redmi 3S. Its important TV exclusives include BPL and LeEco. Additionally, Flipkart and Infibeam were named the only two online resellers of Apple Inc.’s latest iPhone, although it’s not clear if this prohibits other e-commerce firms including Amazon from sourcing the phone from other Apple distributors. The iPhone’s launch is expected on 7 October. To be sure, earlier this month, Flipkart lost exclusivity over LeEco, one of its largest-selling smartphone brands. It has exclusivity with VU TVs, its largest-selling TV brand, but Amazon and others have still found ways to offer the brand on their platforms. Amazon (Amazon Seller Services Pvt. Ltd) has struck its own attractive exclusive smartphones deals such as Lenovo Z2 Plus, HTC Desire 10 and OnePlus 3. In all, Amazon said it has 57 exclusive smartphone partnerships, though a majority of these phones were launched several months ago. Flipkart’s exclusive offerings in smartphones and TVs are important because electronics is the single biggest category in e-commerce. In October 2015, electronic products accounted for roughly 70% of gross sales at e-commerce firms, according to market researcher RedSeer Management Consulting Pvt. Ltd. Within electronics, smartphones are by far the dominant product category, followed by TVs. “The key categories will be smartphones, fashion and large appliances, and whoever dominates these will come out as the winner in October,” said Mrigank Gutgutia, engagement manager at RedSeer. “The hope is that the e-commerce market as a whole will benefit by the addition of new users. We are estimating that monthly users will increase by 20-30% next month.” Flipkart also has an edge over Amazon because of its ownership of fashion retailers Myntra and Jabong. Fashion contributed about 20% of the gross sales at e-commerce firms last year, according to RedSeer. Myntra said it expects daily sales to increase by five times in the Big Billion Day week. Flipkart and Amazon will face off in the first week of October with their respective sale events, Big Billion Day and Great India Festival. This festival season is the most significant ever period for Indian e-commerce companies, particularly for Flipkart, which is trying to revive sales growth and win back market share from Amazon. The US-based online retailer generated higher sales than Flipkart on a standalone basis for the second consecutive month in August, setting the stage for the festival season, the outcome of which could well determine the future of Indian e-commerce firms, Mint reported on 12 September. Including Myntra and Jabong, Flipkart was still ahead of Amazon in the two months. While Flipkart lagged behind Amazon in gross sales in July and August, it finally saw a pick-up in sales growth in these months, indicating that the turnaround efforts of CEO Binny Bansal and Kalyan Krishnamurthy, business and advertising head, are finally yielding improved results. If the company has a successful October, it may get the platform to keep improving its results and raise a fresh round of funds. “Big Billion Day is the biggest sale event of the year in India when millions of new shoppers browse online and we convert many of them into customers,” said Flipkart marketing head Samardeep Subandh. “The intent is to expand the market with Big Billion Day. We have run an extensive marketing campaign and our aim is to reach 30-40% more people with it compared with the campaign for last year’s Big Billion Days.” Subandh declined to disclose the company’s sales targets for October. In last year’s Big Billion Day week, Flipkart generated about Rs2,000 crore in gross sales. ALSO READ | Large appliances the next growth driver for online retail sales Amazon, too, expects user traffic to grow “multifold” this festival season, a spokesperson said by email. “We have 200% more sellers (compared with last October); we have thrice the selection and we have 1.5 time more fulfilment capacity. We expect millions of new customers to shop on the sale and experience Amazon.in for the first time..,” the spokesperson said.

Business Home LBoard Bersih 2.0: Rally will continue, with or without Maria FMT Reporters Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US BlackBerry lesson: Adapt or die in the internet Age AFP | September 30, 2016 The tech sector is young and fast-moving in an internet culture that praises "disruption" and "revolution" of industries and lifestyles. SAN FRANCISCO: BlackBerry has joined Yahoo, Nokia and other technology industry stars felled by an internet age in which companies are forced to evolve quickly or perish. Canadian-based BlackBerry announced Wednesday it would halt in-house production of smartphones, marking the end of an era for the once-dominant handset producer. Originally known as Research in Motion, the company earned a dedicated following of “CrackBerry” addicts and introduced millions to the smartphone. But, its luster faded with the introduction of the iPhone in 2007 and the large number of low-costs Android handsets that followed. BlackBerry travelled a road well-worn. Finland’s Nokia, once the world’s largest mobile phone maker, has seen its smartphone business go up in smoke as well. Internet pioneer Yahoo recently inked a deal to sell its core business to US telecommunications firm Verizon after years of struggling in vain to revive growth in an online search market usurped by Google. “What they have in common is that they haven’t reacted well to rapid change from their original positions,” said Endpoint Technologies Associates analyst Roger Kay. “Tech has high velocity.” The tech sector is young and fast-moving in an internet culture that praises “disruption” and “revolution” of industries and lifestyles. Among mottos found on the walls of leading social network Facebook is “Move fast and break things.” Smartphones themselves have become seemingly indispensible, with people typically replacing handsets every year or two in order to have the newest features or capabilities. Resting on laurels Changing to capitalize on a new trend can be daunting for companies comfortable with products that keep revenue flowing for the moment. “It reminds me of all those old singers going to Las Vegas to do whatever it is they do when they should really have just stopped,” Kay said of tech companies sticking with what early hits. “Everybody wants to do an encore and get paid again.” When Apple launched the iPhone in 2007, some critiques questioned why the California company was “cannibalizing” its successful line of iPods. The iPhone became a global sensation, and a main driver of stellar profit for Apple. Kay noted that when Yahoo ruled internet search it became clear their model was under attack by a newcomer called Google. Yahoo may not have seen the threat, or may have blinded itself to the need for change because its old business model continued to pump revenue, according to Kay. And while there are individual specifics underlying the downfall of incumbent mobile phone titans, they all faced the sudden and simultaneous rise of two powerhouses Apple disrupted smartphones and lifestyles with its iPhone, and Google fired back with an Android mobile operating system that any consumer electronics maker was free to use. The Google and Apple one-two punch was enough to essentially “pivot” a smartphone market that incumbents thought was too stable to rattle, according to independent Silicon Valley analyst Rob Enderle. “None of the big firms were prepared to deal with it,” Enderle said of two companies new to the smartphone scene fueling a revolution. Unlike the birth of search engine Google on a young and growing internet, mobile phones were an existing market that incumbents felt they knew well and were “completely taken aback b the combination of Apple and Google,” according to Enderle. Reinvention Veteran technology firms being overtaken by newcomers is not necessarily inevitable, if established companies have the wit and courage to re-invent themselves, adapting to survive. Analyst Kay noted IBM, a century-old technology company that has embraced transformation time and again, even shedding products along the way. Computer chip giant Intel shifted its focus to microprocessors for mobile devices to adapt to how internet-connected devices were evolving. Apple itself was a computer company on the brink of bankruptcy when it staked its future on iPods and iPhones in a winning move that made it one of the most profitable companies on the planet. The future is a question mark for Microsoft, once the world’s largest company, which has fallen behind Apple and Google as the PC industry declines and which is refocusing on enterprise services. But reinvention isn’t a cure-all, and needs ongoing commitment to change along with vision of where markets are heading. IBM now seems tangled in endless restructuring, with revenue declining for more than four years; Intel continues to struggle to find the kind of success it had with big computer chips. Analysts have taken to wondering whether Apple itself has become too dependent on the iPhone, and is taking too long to come up with “the next big thing.” Comments Readers are required to have a valid Facebook account to comment on this story.

Apple has been pursing a highly secretive project to develop its own venture in the electric and autonomous vehicle space, code-named "Project Titan," and it recently entered negotiations with McLaren on a potential deal, according to The Financial Times. "We can confirm that McLaren is not in talks with Apple in respect of any investment or acquisition," spokesperson Wayne Bruce told the E-Commerce Times. When we asked specifically if Apple had approached the company about a potential deal, Bruce responded, "Such is the nature of our business that a variety of different companies have confidential discussions with us and must remain so." Led by CEO Ron Dennis, McLaren is known in the industry as a long-standing innovator in the European racing and luxury performance car circuits. It built the 12C and 12C Spider and the McLaren P1, and it is known for using lightweight carbon fiber materials that give its vehicles a unique combination of speed and durability. The company is pursuing its own strategy of autonomous vehicle technology, Bruce said, confirming earlier reports that its focus was on adding autonomous safety features to its line of performance cars. Apple Retools Such a tie-up could make sense for Apple, given its history of failed negotiations and its desire to kick-start its car development project to catch up with rivals Tesla and Google, among others. "Having McLaren by their side would give [Apple] a unique position in the automotive arena, a step above what Tesla, Faraday Future and Karma automotive have in mind for their future losses," said Vishwas Shankar, mobility research manager at Frost & Sullivan. "Apple, after many failed talks with German OEMs, needs a partner with global appeal," he told the E-Commerce Times. McLaren has a number of proprietary patents related to its proficiency in race technology, high-tech medical devices and research, Kelley Blue Book analyst Michael Harley told the E-Commerce Times. Second Front Apple also has entered talks to buy startup Lit Motors, which has developed an electric self-balancing motorcycle, according to a New York Times story following up on the FT report. The Times piece cites three anonymous sources. Lit Motors' C-1 is actually a two-wheeled, electric-powered vehicle that looks like a miniature car, with a windshield, roof and doors, and steering wheel. Otherwise, it has features similar to a motorbike or scooter. It uses two gyroscopes to keep it upright, and it uses a steer-by-wire system with sensors. Several former engineers from Lit Motors currently work for Apple, according to the Times report. The rumors come at a critical time for Apple. Its autonomous vehicle project earlier this month suffered a partial closure with layoffs of dozens of employees, according to the NYT. The company this summer lost a key executive, Bart Nabbe, to startup Faraday Future. A feeding frenzy is developing, with major tech companies maneuvering to snap up resources that will help them win the race to dominate the autonomous vehicle business, suggested Steven Polzin, director of mobility policy research at the Center for Urban Transportation Research at the University of South Florida. "It's interesting how the players are being pretty aggressive to stakeout collaborations and partnerships, and nobody wanting to be left out," he told the E-Commerce Times, but it's "not clear how well thought through some of their relationships are."

However Douglas Rushkoff, Professor of Media Theory and Digital Economics at the City University of New York, media theorist and most recently, author of Throwing Rocks at the Google Bus, writes in Digital Trends that The best smartphone is the one you already own. It really salved my own iPhone 7 itch. He is really blunt about it, starting with: Now that Apple has disappointed early adopters with a mere incremental iPhone upgrade, and Samsung has done even worse by releasing exploding Galaxy Note 7s, the preposterous futility of the smartphone wars should be coming apparent. Those people who are trading in perfectly usable phones for the latest models are the suckers. He notes that beyond the cash, there are human and climate costs to these devices, with most of their energy consumption now not in the phones but in the cloud. Siri is not in our phone, but in the computers that it connects to. “The lion’s share of processing activity – and energy consumption – is actually occurring on servers streaming all those videos and making all the harder calculations and analyses.” One could quibble that this doesn't change, whether you are using a new phone or an older model. However he reminds us of all the rare earths and "conflict minerals" that go into making a phone. These include cassiterite from Congo (see our slideshow here) along with gold, tungsten and tantalum. (Apple says it is now auditing 100 percent of its supply chain and claims that "while it isn’t yet declaring its products totally conflict-free, the company said all of its 242 smelters and refiners of tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold are now subject to third-party audits.") Given how minor the improvements are in this round of upgrades, Rushkoff suggests an alternative approach: ..the only real response – the true techie’s response – is to learn how to make one’s phone last as many years as possible. Instead of buying our way out of obsolescence, we program, adapt, and workaround. What makes a phone great is not how new it is, but how long it lasts. It is an interesting problem, particularly now that phones are becoming more like computers, with technical improvements seeming to come more slowly. Four and a half years ago I sought advice from a regular Mac user who, like me, earns his living writing on his machine, and he said “buy the very best, pay for Apple Care, and in 3 years when it runs out, buy a new one.” Now, a year and a half over that time limit, nobody has brought out a machine that is demonstrably better and the MacBook Pro is still working just fine. Similarly my iPhone 6 is out of contract now, over two years old, but I cannot see that the 7 is demonstrably better. (But wait, that camera!) Is the automatic upgrade cycle finally broken?

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 4:00 AM, September 30, 2016 LOS ANGELES — Spotify is in advanced talks to acquire rival music service SoundCloud, according to a report by the Financial Times. An announcement of the acquisition could be made soon, according to the Times. And the acquisition would come just months after SoundCloud launched its own paid streaming service. A Spotify spokesperson declined to comment on the report when contacted; a SoundCloud spokesperson declined as well. Spotify is the market leader in the growing paid streaming business, disclosing earlier this month that it now has more than 40 million paying subscribers. Its biggest competitor is Apple Music, with 17 million paying subscribers. SoundCloud’s own paid service, dubbed SoundCloud Go, likely has not attracted more than a few hundred thousand users ever since it launched in March. However, SoundCloud does have many millions of non-paying users — the latest publicly released metric from December 2014 points to 175 million monthly active users. SoundCloud also has a much larger catalogue than any other streaming music service, to the tune of 125 million tracks. That is because, unlike Spotify and Apple Music, SoundCloud allows its users to directly upload their own tracks without the need to go through any middlemen. This has resulted in emerging artistes posting their demos on the platform, DJs publishing mix sets, and consumers uploading bootleg recordings. In many ways, SoundCloud operates a lot more like YouTube than Spotify, and the Berlin-based startup has long tried to adapt YouTube’s monetisation strategy for streaming music as well. SoundCloud began to monetise free content through advertising last year, and has been looking to offer rights holders the ability to monetise user uploads. That way, a major label would still get paid if a bedroom DJ uploaded a set featuring one of its artistes. Acquiring SoundCloud could help Spotify to bolster its own catalogue and offer emerging artistes an easier way onto the service. It would also help Spotify make the case for ad-supported streaming. Record labels have long pushed Spotify to move towards a purely paid model, similar to the way Apple Music operates. Apple’s service does offer listeners a three-month free trial, but cuts them off after that if they do not open their wallets. Spotify, on the other hand, has long argued that its large free user base has both helped to convert subscribers and monetise those that would never pay. Adding a large number of additional unpaid users could help to bolster that case. However, acquiring SoundCloud would not come without risks for Spotify. For one thing, SoundCloud had to make some concessions in order to get the rights to launch its paid streaming tier. One of them allows major labels to withhold specific tracks from SoundCloud’s free tier, and only make them available to paying subscribers for a set period of time. Spotify has long resisted this kind of windowing, but it may have to change its tune in order to integrate both services.

Now it's also going to develop some of it there. Apple's new landlord in China has revealed some details about the company's first R&D center in the country. The facility, with 500 employees, "will focus on developing advanced technologies, including computer hardware and communications, audio and video equipment and other devices," the state-owned Zhongguancun Science Park Administrative Committee said Thursday in a social media post obtained by the Wall Street Journal. See also Apple's latest numbers show a huge slowdown in China Apple won't crack the Chinese market with the iPhone 7 Apple is pushing into China harder than ever Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. China is one of Apple's most important markets, but the company has struggled there in recent months. In July, Apple revealed its quarterly revenue plummeted by a third in the region to $8.8 billion. The Greater China region (the mainland, Taiwan and Hong Kong) had been poised to become Apple's biggest market in the world, but the June quarter results dropped it to No. 3 behind the US and Europe. And earlier this year, China shut down the iTunes movie and books services in the country. Apple has been trying to improve its situation in China, though. During its developer conference in June, the company showed off China-focused features for its iOS 10 software, and in May it invested $1 billion in Didi Chuxing, China's Uber, possibly part of an attempt to butter up the Chinese government. At the same time, the Chinese government has been trying to expand beyond simply building devices for foreign companies. 10 The iPhone 7 Plus' 'portrait' mode does background blur better Tags Apple Mobile Computers Apple All the latest Apple news, featuring developments on the iPhone, iPad, Macbooks, OS X and much more.

Numerous reports are coming in saying that the iPhone 7 has big problems connecting to in-car Bluetooth. Problems range from BMWs to Kias to my own Ford, and include audio cut-out or problems connecting. Given that I can't use the aux-in cable and also charge my phone, this is a very real problem. DON'T MISS: Yup, now the iPhone 7 is exploding Commenters have cropped up on Reddit, Apple's official support forums, and the MacRumors forum. Going off the number of complaints, it seems like BMW, Kia and Ford vehicles are all having repeat problems connecting, while some users are complaining about intermittent issues with Bluetooth speakers. BMW has confirmed that there is an issue, saying in a statement that "at this time, the Apple iPhone 7 is not an approved device for our vehicles until testing has completed. We do not currently have an estimated time frame regarding the completion of iPhone 7 testing. Please continue to look for an update from Apple for a new iOS and our update website to help resolve your concerns: www.bmw.com/update." It's not uncommon for brand-new phones to have Bluetooth connectivity issues, although a problem that causes audio to cut out (what I've been experiencing in a car with an (admittedly dated) Ford Sync system) is more serious than most. More than anything else, this really highlights why Apple may have been premature in killing the headphone jack. Bluetooth is fantastic when it works, but it's still a glitchy and inconsistent standard. The very idea that BMW needs an "approved list of devices" goes to show that it's not reliable enough to be the only audio connection standard. Cars are also the worst place for the iPhone 7's Bluetooth to be malfunctioning. You can't even use your stupid dongle to plug in, because streaming music while also using Maps will eat through your battery life in ten seconds flat, and you can't charge the iPhone 7 while also listening to music. Hopefully, Apple will get around to fixing this problem soon, although even the latest version of iOS 10.1 beta doesn't fix it for me. But more than anything else, this just goes to show that while removing the headphone jack might be "courageous" in Cupertino's perfect testing environment, in a four-year-old car that hasn't had a firmware update in years, courage looks very different.

Club MacStoriesWeekly Extras MENU ABOUT CONTACT NEWSLETTER ADVERTISE SECTIONS APP REVIEWS LINKED STORIES iOS 10 WWDC 2016 The In-Between Macs My New iPad Pro Keyboard: The Razer Mechanical Keyboard Case Why I’m Considering Bear as a Notes App Replacement This week's sponsor Secrets a beautifully simple password manager, now Free on the App Store Apple Starts Selling App Store Search Ads, Launching October 5th By John Voorhees First announced at WWDC in June and beta-tested over the Summer, Apple launched Search Ads for iOS apps today. The ads will appear at the top of App Store customers’ search results based on a combination of search relevancy and bidding. According to Apple, the program is designed to be a simple way for developers to get their apps in front of potential customers. Developers can sign up today and schedule campaigns, but ads won’t go live until October 5, 2016. In an email to developers Apple says: Search Ads was designed to be effortless for small and independent developers. Invest as much or as little time as you have and still get results. We create your ads and match them to relevant searches. You can refine who sees your ad with optional keyword, audience and location features, and you only pay when a customer taps on your ad. I gave Search Ads a try by setting up an ad campaign for Blink, my iTunes affiliate linking app. The first thing I did was register for the program. I got a confirmation email back from Apple with a $100 promotional credit for trying Search Ads. Picking an app to promote and creating a campaign. Setting up a campaign was straightforward and only took about 15 minutes. There is an introductory video at the top of the Search Ads site, which provides a good overview of the program, but be patient, it took a while to load, undoubtedly because so many people were watching simultaneously. There is also extensive help documentation that explains every step of the sign up and campaign creation process if you have questions. The campaign setup process has three main components: Scheduling, which includes setting a campaign start date, optional end date, and hours of each day of the week that it will run; Budgeting, including picking a total amount to spend on the campaign, an optional daily spending limit, and a maximum cost per tap; and Search keyword selection, which determines which search results your ads will be displayed against. There are a few other details and payment information that must be input, but the process was easy and included contextual help every step of the way that helped where I had questions. Setting up search terms and a completed campaign. During campaign creation, keywords are suggested based on the metadata used for a developer’s app. The ultimate cost per tap to the developer is determined for a keyword auction, subject to the maximum limits developers set. Although the auction plays a role in determining which ads are displayed in the App Store, Apple says that the auction is secondary to ad relevancy. How Apple decides what is relevant is not disclosed in the documentation. It will be interesting to see how Search Ads play out. I am especially curious whether the emphasis on relevancy will give smaller developers who cannot afford to bid as much per tap as larger companies a chance to promote their apps to users. One thing is for sure, App Store ‘relevancy’ is about to launch a whole new branch of the app search optimization industry.

More Comments Tumblr Pinterest Reddit Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon In a cutthroat smartphone market where it is tough to pull consumers away from some of the juggernauts — such as Apple and Samsung — Motorola is betting on modular accessories that can be swapped in and out  to standout.  Purchased by Google in 2011 for US$12.5 billion — which, most importantly, included all of its patents — Motorola was later sold to the Lenovo in 2014 for just under US$3 billion. So now Motorola is back as its own standalone brand and returns to the hardware game once again with the release of the Moto Z and Moto Z Play — the former being their flagship premium model and the latter offering a less expensive alternative.  Both models use what Motorola calls Moto Mods, which have proprietary magnet inputs on the back that allow accessories such as a point-and-shoot camera, projector or speakers to attach to the back and transmit data (allowing for software updates and new features).  After using both phones and the suite of Moto Mods for a couple of weeks now, it’s obvious that these aren’t just a gimmick and actually offer an intriguing value proposition — for a price.  But first, evaluating the phones Though the Moto Z has been available in the U.S. since June (exclusively through Verizon), it’s now available unlocked and in Canada starting $900 off contract. It has a Snapdragon 820 processor, 4GB of RAM, a 13MP camera and weighs 136g. It’s a quad HD 5.5-inch screen with a resolution of 2560×1440 and 535 pixels per inch, meaning it looks great.  Because it’s so thin, the Moto Z doesn’t have a headphone jack and instead can use Bluetooth for audio or the included adapter to convert old headphones to the phone’s USB-C port (sound familiar?). Like with Apple’s new iPhone 7 models, this really doesn’t feel like too much of an issue though in day-to-day use. Now compare all of this to Moto Z’s less expensive sibling, the Moto Z Play (which starts at $650 off contract). The specs aren’t as beefy, with a Snapdragon 625 processor, 3GB of RAM and a 16MP camera (though a higher number, it doesn’t have optical stabilization and has a smaller aperture). It’s thicker, so there actually is a headphone jack and it weighs 165g. The screen is only full HD with a 1920 x 1080 resolution and 403 pixels per inch, meaning compared to the Moto Z it’s not as sharp and apps like YouTube will max out at 1080p (instead of 1440p).  Both come in 32 GB or 64 GB options, expandable up to a whopping 2TB with MicroSD cards. They have water-repellent coating, near field communication for digital wallets, fingerprint reader (though you’ll keep hitting it like a home button) and very impressive TurboPower-capable batteries.  The battery life is rather impressive, easily lasting throughout the day with typical use. Some benchmark tests by other media outlets have batteries lasting nearly a full day in airplane mode playing non-stop video. If the battery does become too low, the handy TurboPower feature gives you up to eight hours of power in just 15 minutes of charging, or in about 30 minutes you can get half of your battery back. Impressive.  Both phones feel good to hold, with the edge going to the Moto Z thanks to its comfortable slim form factor. Sometimes less actually is more as it feels so light, especially compared to Apple’s iPhone 7 Plus. Both phones are responsive and don’t show any signs of sluggishness. If you’re comfortable with Android, you’ll feel at home. However there are still some hiccups. Though the screens are gorgeous natively — even more so on the Moto Z — not many apps take advantage of the large real estate. It’s not the case with every app, but for example Twitter, Facebook or even Google’s built-in suite often feels like the resolution isn’t appropriate, with buttons or text taking up extra space when compared side-by-side to the iPhone — though often media in the app once opened looks fine. I went into the settings to change the phone’s font down to its smallest size to help free up screen space, but that only changes the text and not other elements. Perhaps this is just a victim of the fragmented Android ecosystem, so they can’t be coded for the Moto series directly. Both cameras shoot exceptionally well, too. The colours are a bit more vibrant on the premium Moto Z and its lowlight is better thanks to the different aperture. But though it has a quick autofocus and helpful optical image stabilization, you do see some of the Moto Z’s limitations as some photos aren’t as sharp in cases — such as if there are lots of edges or text to read in a wide-angle shot. But if you’re not using the phones for professional photography, it’s plenty capable and beats out entry-to-mid level competitors. The built-in speaker, on the other hand, is pretty horrible. It’s located in the same opening as the phone’s ear speaker, meaning you can expect plenty of tin-can sounding music or videos. It works as a quick fix, but at peak volumes it quickly starts breaking. Perhaps Motorola just wants you to buy a speaker Moto Mod. Speaking of which… Moto Mods: Choose-your-own-adventure accessories the differentiator What Motorola hopes will woo over users is its line of Moto Mods that work with both the Moto Z and Moto Z Play. On the bottom back of the phones are 16 small metal circles and a magnetic hole that allow various accessories to snap on and off as desired. So, for example, you can slap on a different back to change the look of the phone, depending on your flavour of the day or event you are attending. These Style Backs cost $29 and come in different colours and materials.  But the Moto Mods really get interesting with the accessories that add completely new functionality to the phones. Here’s the break down: Hasselblad True Zoom The flagship Moto Mod is the point-and-shoot style camera add-on that is made in partnership with cameramaker Hasselblad. Called the Hasselblad True Zoom, the accessory uses the native camera app but gives you a 10x optical zoom and set of buttons on the top that truly feel like a standalone point and shoot camera. It comes with its own carrying case, too, so the idea is that if you are out and want to quickly snap a picture of something far away you can reach into your bag and pull out the accessory to attach to your phone. The Hasselblad True Zoom has its own flash, better lowlight functionality than the phone’s built-in camera and optical image stabilization for still photos. You do lose megapixels though, moving down to 12 instead of the 13 megapixels in the phone’s camera, meaning other smartphone cameras can pump out better close-up shots. But the big thing here is the 10x zoom without losing image quality. The zoom works for video, too, but the quality is noticeably decreased because it switches to digital image stabilization and only shoots 1080p. Here are three photos taken with the Hasselblad True Zoom without physically moving. The first is in default position, the second is at 5x zoom and the final is 10x zoom. You can click the images to enlarge. The Hasselblad True Zoom releases in October for $349. Motorola Insta-Share Projector The other really nifty accessory is Motorola’s Insta-Share Projector, which once you attach will project the phone’s contents on the wall up to 70” in size. It has a built-in stand so you can rest the phone and either use the screen or a Bluetooth accessory to control whichever app you’re projecting. The accessory has Auto-Keystone correction up to +/- 40 degrees, so as you change the angle of the phone (say, move from the ceiling to the wall) it will adjust the angle of the projection accordingly. The contrast ratio is 400:1 and it has 50 lumens, meaning it works pretty well in dark and lowlight situations, especially for video or gaming. In brighter rooms it will be fine for presentations or work situations, but you won’t want to use it for anything too detailed. The resolution is only 480p though, and you’ll need to charge it separately. Want to watch a long movie? You’ll definitely need to plug it into the wall, since it only gets about an hour of battery life, plus you’ll want to hook up an external speaker because of the poor built-in speakers. That said, the projector is still a great accessory for those who want to quickly set up Netflix at the cottage, show a fun video to a group of people or if you want to do a quick work presentation. It’ll set you back $399 though, which is a pretty hefty price for an accessory. JBL SoundBoost Speaker If you find the audio quality of the Moto Z and Moto Z Play’s built-in speakers pretty bad, which they are, then the JBL Soundboost Speaker is a decent option. Attach it on the back and flip out the kickstand for better music and video audio quality, plus it can get relatively loud if you want to quickly throw something on for small gatherings. It can hit about 10 hours worth of battery life as well, which is nice. That said, aside from the on-the-go convenience, the audio quality still isn’t fantastic. When you get closer to its maximum volume, the audio does start to pop and gets muddy. It’s great for a few people nearby, but a standalone speaker with Bluetooth functionality may be a better option if you’re looking to play music at a party. Then again, the JBL Soundboost Speaker is designed to be quick, light and more for on-the-go purposes, and it does do all of that just fine. It has a $99 price tag. Incipio offGRID Power Pack As previously mentioned, both the Moto Z and the Moto Z Play have pretty fantastic battery life, plus the TurboPower charging feature makes topping up really quick. But if you still find yourself in need of some extra juice, you can pick up the Incipio offGRID Power Pack to attach on the back and essentially double the phone’s power. Related Apple iPhone 7 and 7 Plus review : No headphone jack, but camera alone enough to impress BlackBerry DTEK50 Review : Secure, reasonably priced but light on battery life Realistically, most people probably won’t need the accessory, but it is a nice option for those who may do intensive tasks for long periods of time and there really are no complaints to find with it. It costs $89. Final thoughts: Motorola is back The flagship Moto Z and cheaper Moto Z Play are both excellent Android phones that I found myself genuinely impressed with overall. Starting at $650 outright, the Moto Z Play in particular is a great value for a mid-range smartphone if you can live with some spec sacrifices. The Moto Z is aimed to be a premium product at a premium price ($900) and it definitely shows in day-to-day use with a better camera, screen and form factor. But now you are entering the iPhone 7’s price range, which has an appealing value proposition with a better camera and better use of screen real estate (albeit you’d get the smaller 4.7-inch iPhone). The biggest problem with the Moto Z and Moto Z Play is also its best feature: the Moto Mods. Quickly swapping out the back of the phone with various accessories for a variety of purposes is not just a great idea, but it’s a great conversation starter when you show it off to people. However it’s a very expensive proposition when compared to alternatives out there since you have to purchase everything separately, especially considering the flagship Moto Mods — like the projector and camera — costing several hundred dollars each.  Nonetheless, the Moto Z is a solid phone that feels great and is worth checking out if you’re in the market for a new Android device. Or, if you’re an iPhone user wanting to test the Android waters, the Moto Z Play is a great less expensive option while also making the Moto Mods look a little more affordable.

Networking | 29 Aug 2016 | Print  | Comment (2) Google’s Duo Video Chat App Links iOS and Android by Julio Ojeda-Zapata Our son is off to college, taking his first smartphone with him. While we’re an Apple household, he’s carrying a Google Nexus 5X on Google’s Project-Fi cell service. This platform gap creates a problem: how will we video chat with our young man? FaceTime isn’t an option. Apple’s video chat service doesn’t work outside the Mac and iOS ecosystems despite Apple’s early assurances that it would be made an open standard at some point. Apple has said nothing about this lately, and I’m not holding my breath. Our family has other options, including Skype (a favorite of my Mac-centric better half) and Facebook Messenger (to which my son and I are addicted). But Google has just swooped in with an intriguing third option: Duo. The previously announced video chat app has a potentially broad audience since it works on both the iPhone and Android phones (see “Google I/O 2016 Includes Announcements with Apple Appeal,” 23 May 2016). Its radical simplicity also makes competing apps look convoluted. However, Duo won’t be the ideal choice for all iPhone users, and FaceTime is likely to remain the default for those using Apple gear. Simple as Can Be -- Duo was designed from the ground up – and separately from Google’s other video chat app, Hangouts – to be simple and easy to use. All it requires for setup is your mobile phone number, which is what other Duo users need to reach you. Punch in your digits, and the app texts you a confirmation number. Tap that in, and you’re good to go. You’re then presented with a minimalist interface – a video window at the top and a Video Call button at the bottom. Tap the button and select a contact. If that person is a Duo user, the app initiates a call. If not, it texts out an invitation to install the app. Once you have a couple of calls under your belt, buttons for those contacts appear alongside the Video Call button, nudging it leftward. I derive comfort as a newly minted empty nester from having a dedicated button for my kiddo available for the tapping anytime. The actual call interface shows the other person full-screen, giving you a small bubble off to the side so you can make sure you’re properly framed. You can tap that button to switch places, showing your face full-screen and the other party in the bubble When you turn the phone to landscape mode, the video window adjusts to the new orientation, but if the other person doesn’t also rotate their phone, you’ll see gray bars on both sides of the picture. Tap the screen during a call to display buttons for muting the mic, swapping to the other camera, and ending the call. That’s Duo in a nutshell — I told you it was simple — although there is one novel twist, called Knock Knock. Knock Knock refers to a preview feature that shows live video of the caller before you accept the call. It’s handy for call screening and may inspire callers to engage in goofy hijinks to entice you into picking up. Knock Knock works only with callers who are in your contact list, so you’re protected from unwanted and potentially icky Knock Knocks. If a contact abuses Knock Knock, you can block them. There is a catch for iOS users: Duo must be open and on the screen for the preview to appear. Otherwise, incoming calls show only a call alert. You also have to unlock the iPhone before you can take the call, which isn’t necessary on Android. Duo Versus FaceTime -- On the surface, Duo seems like a FaceTime clone. Tap a contact, make a call. But FaceTime is more powerful and makes Duo look sparse. Here are things to keep in mind when comparing the two: Just a phone app: The fact that Duo works on Android as well as iOS is a plus, but that’s the extent of its hardware flexibility. It’s a phone app; that’s it. Though it runs on an iPad, even one without cellular service, it’s not optimized for larger screens. FaceTime works natively on the iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Only one device: When I tried to set up Duo on a second phone, Google canceled Duo access on the first device. The app is still there, but it wouldn’t let me use my phone number with Duo on more than one handset at a time. This is an annoyance for people like me who are accustomed to taking video calls on whatever device is handy. Apps like FaceTime, Facebook Messenger, and Hangouts connect with user accounts, not phone numbers, which frees them for use on multiple devices that are all logged into the same account. No audio calls (mostly): Duo’s video quality can adjust to varying conditions, which can range from a blazingly fast home broadband connection to an iffy cellular signal. It can also transfer calls almost seamlessly between Wi-Fi and cell connections. If a connection is particularly poor, Duo drops the call to just audio. This, however, is the extent of the app’s audio-only capabilities. You cannot choose to initiate an audio-only call, as you can with FaceTime and other apps. No group calls: As with FaceTime, Duo offers strictly one-to-one calls. In comparison, Google’s Hangouts and Skype both support video chats with three or more people. No text chat integration: When Google announced Duo in May 2016, the company also revealed the Allo text chat app that looks to give the revamped iOS 10 version of Messages stiff competition (see “iOS 10 Promises New Lock Screen, Open Siri, and More,” 13 June 2016). However, Duo and Allo are entirely separate apps, which is Google’s way of keeping them simple and uncluttered. It succeeded in this regard, particularly with Duo. For some, the lack of integration between the two apps could be problematic. Allo has yet to debut, so it’s possible that Google will link the two apps. That’s roughly what Apple did with FaceTime and Messages. Pull up a contact in FaceTime, and you see buttons to text that person, make a cell call, initiate a FaceTime session (audio or video) or send an email. The absence of such options in Duo is jarring. Separate from other Google apps: I’ve long used Google Voice, which gives me a phone number for calling, texts, and the like. It’s my One Number To Rule Them All, with options to relay incoming calls to other numbers (like my home and work land lines), among a plethora of other features. Google later released Hangouts, and the company has since haltingly and imperfectly labored to integrate Google Voice with Hangouts. Google has never completed that integration to my satisfaction; it’s a longstanding gripe with Google Voice users. And now Google has released yet another calling app that has no connection to Google Voice or Hangouts. This, too, is jarring, but understandable given that Google is starting fresh with a simple app (compared to Hangouts, which is nightmarishly convoluted). So Google users may be excused for watching this increasingly fragmented app landscape and wondering what the heck Google intends in the long term. Google has a history of unceremoniously executing apps and services it deems passé. Security: Duo and FaceTime are on par in one important respect: both Google and Apple offer end-to-end encryption for better security. Do the Duo -- For all of Duo’s shortcomings compared to FaceTime, it’s an app that any iPhone user with Android-using friends or family should install. It’s a painless way to open up another communications conduit that could prove useful. You have nothing to lose. I put Duo on my son’s Nexus 5X before I handed over the device, and made it clear to him that I’d be using it regularly; I couldn’t tell if he was pleased or chagrined. Likewise, I’m encouraging my semi-Luddite parents to use Duo. They have Apple devices but struggle to master their capabilities, and apps like Skype and FaceTime tend to fluster them. Duo is exactly their speed. Luckily, there’s no need for an either-or answer to the question of Duo or FaceTime. Most iPhone users will stick with Apple’s app given its additional features and compatibility across Apple’s hardware line. Those who need Android compatibility can add Duo, and if Duo ends up working better than FaceTime between Apple users, that’s fine too. Should Duo become a hit, I wonder if Apple might kick itself for not making FaceTime cross-platform as it had initially said it would. That seems like a missed opportunity.   READERS LIKE YOU!

They wanted to open source Facetime but they lost a big patent suit by VirnetX, a patent troll. I think it's still under appeal by one or the other, but since it's in East Texas, it's probably best not to hold our breaths.

Here are the best hidden features on the iOS 10 iPhone update: From magnifying text to multiple browsing tabs Just when you thought the nifty updates couldn't get any better!

The new update can be applied to the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch and Apple has described iOS 10 as its “biggest iOS release ever”. New features, such as deleting default apps and sending handwritten messages, have gone down a storm. Last month, we outlined a run-down of the most exciting new iOS 10 additions, but did you know there are some hidden features that may surprise even the biggest tech geeks? From multiple search tabs to magnifying text, here are some impressive features you probably have never noticed… 1. More tabs when browsing #TIL when you put mobile Safari in landscape mode you can search through open *tabs* pic.twitter.com/31ajMiJPwC — Gabriel Visser (@gvssr) June 3, 2016 Finally! iPhone fans no longer have to open multiple windows on Safari when searching the internet. First, rotate your phone horizontally and tap the tabs button in the top right of your device. A new search box will then appear in top left of your phone, where you’re able to search for another topic. When you have typed in the keywords of your choice, you can open the new tab by tapping the screen. 2. You can enlarge text #Magnifier on #ios10 pic.twitter.com/7uNU4no4F3 — primo4k  (@primo4k) June 16, 2016 Struggling to read on your phone? This iOS 10 update allows users to zoom in on difficult-to-see images or words. All Apple users have to do is to open up their settings, select General and then head to Accessibility. You will then have the option to enable or disable the Magnify feature. To use the zoom, tap your home button three times to bring up the Magnify option. Then simply slide your fingers to get closer or further away from the text as you please.

On Thursday, a company that offers bounties for all kinds of unknown exploits in computer systems, known as “zero-days,” increased the payout for anyone who can find a way to jailbreak the iPhone from afar to a whopping $1.5 million. The company, which is called Zerodium, became famous last year when it offered $1 million challenging researchers and bug hunters to find a way to hack the iPhone remotely. “We want to attract more suppliers as we can afford to buy multiple iOS exploit chains,” Chaouki Bekrar, the founder of Zerodium and a well-known zero-day merchant, told Motherboard in an online chat. “We are backed by big buyers and customers, our zero-day acquisition budget is a kind of unlimited.” Read more: Government Hackers Caught Using Unprecedented iPhone Spy Tool Zerodium’s increased payout comes just a few weeks after Apple announced a long-awaited bug bounty program, promising rewards of up to $250,000 to security researchers who find and report bugs to the company. (Apple declined to comment for this article.) “Now that Apple has a well-paying bug bounty, companies like Zerodium will have to pay more to convince researchers to sell their bugs rather than responsibly disclosing them to Apple,” iOS security researcher and jailbreaker C0deH4cker told Motherboard in a chat. The iPhone is widely regarded as the most secure mobile phone in the world, so it’s only natural that companies or government agencies are willing to pay big bucks to get around its air-tight security measures. Despite its higher payouts, some researchers might not want to send their bugs and exploits to Zerodium for moral reasons. “I would rather responsibly disclose iOS vulnerabilities I find to Apple than sell them,“ C0deH4cker said. “If I were to sell a “remote jailbreak” (which is just a euphemism for “complete remote takeover”) to a company like Zerodium, the security vulnerabilities will not get fixed. Also, I would have no idea what my exploits would be used for or who the final buyer would be, such as a domestic or foreign government agency. That’s where the balance of morals and money comes in.“ Other than Zerodium and Apple, another firm, Exodus Intelligence, has attracted attention by offering $500,000 for iPhone exploits the week after Apple launched its bug bounty program. But $1.5 might be above market rate. “Jailbreaks are just too valuable to give away for free because they have been known to go for more than $500,000,” Ryan Duff, a security researcher and former member of US Cyber Command, told Motherboard last week. Moreover, these kind of exploits aren’t that easy to come by. Yes, the iPhone 7 has already been jailbroken by a 19-year-old working by himself, but it takes time, money, and a talent to find exploits that would qualify for Zerodium’s bug bounty. Also, in the case of the young hacker, his jailbreak was local, and not remote. “Figure it takes at least 25% of the total payout amount as upfront investment to find a vulnerability and write an exploit,” Dan Guido, the founder of security firm Trail of Bits, told me. “So you have to spend $375k speculating that you will be able to write the full jailbreak. And it's real speculation. You might spend that much doing the research and come up empty handed.” Yet, for the chance of getting $1.5 million, the risk might be worth it.

The No More Drama songstress burst into song in a preview for her sit-down with the Democratic candidate on her Apple Music show, The 411. In a teaser clip posted to Apple Music’s Twitter page, Blige is seen singing passionately about race and police brutality with her eyes closed as a stoic Clinton watches. The song features the lines: “If an officer stops you, always be polite and never ever run away, Promise mama you’ll keep you hands inside. Is it a gun? Is it a knife? Is it a wallet? This is your life. It ain’t no secret/you can get killed for living in your American skin.” At the end of her impromptu performance the 45-year-old reaches for Clinton’s hand and searches her eyes for answers. There is no denying the intense moment as the politician initially struggles to respond to the display. The clip aired hours after Clinton’s first televised debate with Republican candidate Donald Trump in her race to claim the White House. Blige’s one-to-one singing session divided fans caught up in election fever. While some applauded her for using her platform to evoke change, others claimed that the intense moment was cringeworthy. ” The most awkward video on the internet….Why Is Mary J Blige singing to hillary,” one critic claimed.

Black Friday Tech Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Holiday Gifts Cyber Monday     Redesigned MacBook Pro Is Coming In October Posted: Sep 29 2016, 1:28pm CDT | by Ahmed Humayun, in Rumors | Apple   Concept By Martin Hajek   Its been a long time since Apple released the MacBook Pro with Force Touch pad and upgraded specs. Apple is rumored to announce all new MacBook Pros in October. The iPhone 7 and Apple Watch Series 2 has been the most talked about Apple products in the recent days but now the limelight has shifted to the Mac line-up, which requires updates for quite a while now. Keeping in mind the upcoming holiday shopping season, it has been heard that Apple is preparing to update many of its Mac line up before the next year begins. Don't Miss: The Black Friday 2016 Deals on Sale Now According to Macrumors, the redesigned MacBook Pro will be out in “’as soon as October.” It has been reported that Apple is moving quickly towards the launch of the new MacBook Pro models, and Apple is presently working on the development of the macOS 10.12.1, emphasizing largely on preparing the operating system to support the updated hardware’s brand new features. It has been revealed by many sources to include Touch ID support and OLED “touch bar” replacing the present row of function keys across the top of keyboard. Apple is thought to be switching to "Polaris" graphics chips from AMD on the higher-end 15-inch models. It is considered that the company is planning to test on one more beta version of the macOS 10.12.1 early next week. In order to finalize the software update by the end of that week, so that it can be loaded onto the new hardware presently being made by Apple’s supply chain partners. If eleventh hour bugs or other circumstances require adjustment, that could alter the timeline of Apple’s plans. But if it succeeds it seems that the new MacBook Pro models could be ready to ship off to new customers sometime in the later part of October. Apple seems to be pushing off most of the critical bug fixes and security patches beyond macOS 10.12.1 because of its forthcoming deadline. Less crucial fixes will be incorporated into the following macOS 10.12.2 update. Which we understand Apple is aiming to begin seeding to developers around late October with a goal of public release around late November. Apple is also though of to be launching MacBook Air models with USB-C ports and new iMacs with AMD graphic chips at the end of this year. It is still not clear, whether all three lines will be updated together and will Apple holda a media event to introduce the hardware or choose something more low key such as a press conference, probably accompanied by embargoed media reviews. Apple is also rumored to be working with LG on a new 5k external display to replace the discontinued Apple Thunderbolt display. No timeframe has been reported for the product yet. There is still no word out regarding the Mac Pro and Mac mini, both which need updates.   You May Like The Author Ahmed Humayun Ahmed Humayun is a technology journalist bringing you the hottest tech stories of the day.     Advertisement Leave a Comment Share this Story Follow Us Read the Latest from I4U News Colbert: The New Apple Book Delivers Something Truly Extraordinary 28 minutes ago iPhones in Made in America Possiblity: Report 8 hours ago A Czech Apple-Authorized Reseller claims the Apple Airpod Release date to be set for December 19 hours ago, 1:30pm CST The Official F1 2016 Game for iOS Is Out 20 hours ago, 11:50am CST OLED iPhone 8 To Sit on Top of iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus 23 hours ago, 8:52am CST Victoria’s Secret Angel Elsa Hosk Reveals Secret to Body Confidence 27 minutes ago The North Pole is 36 Degrees Warmer Than Normal 40 minutes ago Victoria's Secret Black Friday 2016 Deals and Tote Announced 53 minutes ago Victoria's Secret Angel Martha Hunt Reveals Her Hard Workout Routine 1 hour ago Top 10 Black Friday Microsoft Xbox One S and Sony PS4 Deals 2 hours ago McLaren Working on a Three-Seat F1-Inspired Hyper-GT 2 hours ago Tesla's Solar Roof to be Cheaper than Regular Roof Even without Energy Factor Says Musk 2 hours ago Scientists Hacked Photosynthesis to Boost Crop Yields 2 hours ago NES Classic In Stock at Walmart at 5pm Last Time 2 hours ago Hyundai Introduces new Autonomous IONIQ Concept at LA Motor Show 3 hours ago Amazon Black Friday 2016 Ad Walmart Black Friday 2016 Ad Target Black Friday 2016 ad Best Buy Black Friday 2016 ad All Black Friday 2016 ads How to Find Hatchimals Deals Find NES Classic Deals Featured News Amazon Black Friday 2016 Deals Announced Walmart Black Friday 2016 Ad Released   How to Beat Bots to Buy Nintendo NES Classic at Walmart Each Day at 5pm Top 100 Black Friday 2016 Deals That Win Black Friday Apple Colbert: The New Apple Book Delivers Something Truly Extraordinary 28 minutes ago iPhones in Made in America Possiblity: Report 8 hours ago A Czech Apple-Authorized Reseller claims the Apple Airpod Release date to be set for December 19 hours ago, 1:30pm CST The Official F1 2016 Game for iOS Is Out 20 hours ago, 11:50am CST More Apple Stories Latest News Victoria’s Secret Angel Elsa Hosk Reveals Secret to Body Confidence 27 minutes ago Colbert: The New Apple Book Delivers Something Truly Extraordinary 28 minutes ago The North Pole is 36 Degrees Warmer Than Normal 40 minutes ago Victoria's Secret Black Friday 2016 Deals and Tote Announced 53 minutes ago More Latest News The Latest ...

Black Friday Tech Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Holiday Gifts Cyber Monday     Apple Is Secretly Meeting With World’s Best Hackers Posted: Sep 29 2016, 1:35pm CDT | by Ahmed Humayun, in Rumors | Apple     Jailbreaking is in danger.... It has been reported by Forbes that Apple is meeting with a group of carefully selected hackers from the jailbreak world and beyond, in secret. The objective of the meeting is to brief the hackers about the upcoming launch of the company’s bug bounty program. As formerly discussed, the Black Hat Conference was used by apple earlier this year to declare the introduction of a program designed to reward security researchers and hackers to look for and report bugs in macOS and iOS. How To: Find Nintendo NES Classic In Stock It is reported that Apple has invited some of the best hackers in the world to participate in the confidential meeting, most probably to go through the details of the new bounty program before its official launch. The list of hackers includes Luca Rodesco, the first person to showcase in public a working jailbreak of iPhone 7. Nicholas Allegra, who is rather known by his online moniker Comex and was responsible for jailbreak solutions such as JailbreakMe, and Patrick Wardle, an ex-NSA employee who has been rather adamant regarding his lack of trust in the security within Apple’s desktop operating system. Apple believes that these hackers, amongst others are talented enough to find critical, and therefore important, bugs in its macOS and iOS platforms. It has also been reported that other famous individuals who have been linked with jailbreak were present at Apple’s meeting. The list of names include Pedro Vilaca, Alex Ionescu, Jonathan Zdziarski, Steven De Franco aka iH8sn0w, Francisco Alonso, and Stefan Esser aka i0n1c who makes an extremely polarizing figure online because of his bold comments on all things security, jailbreak and Apple.It has also been heard that Apple had contacted Hao Xu, a current member of Pangu team, to take part in the meeting on line with the view of giving information on bugs within iPhone and iOS. It is said that there were more people on the list but Apple has kept the list short and confidential. Apple is seeking to give away cash rewards of up to $200,000 for information linked to the critical vulnerabilities present in the system that power its devices, as part of the new bug bounty program. Apple has adopted a new approach. Instead of making the program public, the company has just selected a few individuals to help them in this matter in order to maintain efficiency. Now how Apples new venture will affect the future of public jailbreak releases in something we just have to wait and watch.

The third quarter's smooth ascent was a turnaround from the topsy-turvy returns of the spring, when worries about the British vote to leave the European Union had global markets convulsing. It also keeps most funds on track for an up year. Through Wednesday, 94 percent of the 7,510 funds tracked by Morningstar have made money in 2016. That's a much higher rate of success than 2015, when only 37 percent of funds gained. Last quarter's returns came despite a long list of worries that could have spooked investors. Economic growth around the world is still only modest, and U.S. corporate earnings are in the midst of their longest string of declines since the Great Recession. Even still, the largest mutual fund by assets, Vanguard's Total Stock Market Index fund, managed to return 4.5 percent in the quarter through Wednesday. Interest rates remain low, which is pushing investors to pay higher prices for stocks even though earnings are falling. Bond funds, meanwhile, eked out modest gains. Here's a look at some of the trends that shaped the quarter for fund investors: — The Apple effect A big factor for many funds' good quarter was the resurgence of Apple's stock. The technology company is the largest by market value, and its immense size means its movements have a bigger effect on how indexes — and the funds that track them — perform than any other stock. Apple returned 19.8 percent in the quarter through Wednesday, including dividends. It soared on excitement about orders for its new iPhone model. Funds heavily invested in Apple benefited. The Fidelity Select Computers fund, for example, has roughly a fifth of its portfolio in Apple, and its 16.9 percent third-quarter return through Wednesday was more than quadruple an S&P 500 index fund's return. Many funds run by stock pickers, though, didn't get as big a lift from Apple's rise. That's because many keep a smaller percentage of their portfolios in Apple than index funds do. In fund jargon, managers say they are "underweight" Apple, whose stock had been mostly falling since peaking in early 2015. After looking at the holdings of 435 mutual funds with $1.5 trillion in assets, strategists at Goldman Sachs found that the average fund had 2 percent of its assets invested in Apple stock, lower than their benchmark indexes' 2.7 percent. That makes Apple one of the most "underweighted" stocks for mutual fund managers, along with Exxon Mobil and AT&T. — A quiet quarter for bond funds Bond funds rose last quarter, but not by much. It's a result of the low yields found across the bond market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note dropped to a record low during the summer, and that means bonds are producing less interest income than before. It also means interest rates have less room to fall, and falling rates are what mean price increases for bonds. A sizable group of investors has been saying bonds have become too expensive and are due for a pullback. Despite those predictions, demand for bonds has remained strong, keeping rates low and steady through the third quarter. The largest bond mutual fund, Vanguard's Total Bond Market Index fund, returned 0.4 percent through Wednesday. The fund tracks an index of investment-grade bonds, including Treasurys and high-quality corporate bonds. Actively managed funds have more freedom to focus on areas of the bond market that have higher yields, along with higher risks. The largest actively managed bond funds, the PIMCO Total Return fund and the Metropolitan West Total Return Bond fund, returned between 0.8 percent and 1 percent through Wednesday, depending on which share class you owned. — Emerging strength Some of the best returns this past quarter came from a group of funds that only a year ago were among the world's worst. Emerging-market stock funds have roared higher as investors scour the world for companies able to deliver strong earnings growth in a slow global economy. Bond funds that specialize in developing economies were also strong because they offer higher yields than bonds from the U.S., Europe or Japan. The Oppenheimer Developing Markets fund is the largest actively managed emerging-market stock fund, and it returned 10.1 percent for the quarter through Wednesday, more than double an S&P 500 index fund. That big jump, though, only means that it recovered some of its losses from earlier, when worries about slowing economic growth in emerging markets weighed down returns. The Oppenheimer fund is still down from two years ago. Share or comment on this article e-mail Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

Trending in Apple How Apple’s stock apps will use the Touch Bar on the new MacBook Pro [Gallery] September 29 AAPL: 112.18 -1.77 iPhone 7 Plus: Portrait mode impressions on iOS 10.1 beta [Photos] Zac Hall - 2 months ago @apollozac iPhone 7 View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit I admit that I buy a new iPhone every year for the camera upgrades. My iCloud Photo Library is up to 14,633 photos and 1,261 videos and growing. Almost every one of those were captured with an iPhone so its camera matters to me. Last year’s iPhone 6s introduced Live Photos which I absolutely love. (This from November is just one of my favorites; you can view it on the web thanks to Tumblr’s new Live Photo feature). This year includes Portrait mode on the iPhone 7 Plus which intelligently applies a blur effect over backgrounds on still shots. Portrait mode photos often look like they were shot on dedicated cameras, not smartphones. The feature requires the dual camera system on the iPhone 7 Plus to work and is only available in beta on iOS 10.1 beta for now. Apple wants to fine tune Portrait mode’s performance before it hits primetime, and there are a few things we can already learn about it through testing. I’m a little late to the game here because my 256GB Jet Black iPhone 7 Plus only just arrived yesterday, but I got the chance to try out Portrait mode over the weekend on my wife’s iPhone and a lot more yesterday and today. Benjamin and I discussed it briefly on this week’s 9to5Mac Happy Hour podcast, and I have a few more points to make after further testing. First, people are really impressed by Portrait mode shots when you share them on social media and suspect they came from the iPhone 7 Plus and not a dedicated camera. Photos in Instagram are reduced to such a low resolution and so much detail is lost that flaws in the blur effect are harder to see (example). I shared a few shots on Facebook last night too, for example, and my colleague Dan from 9to5Toys had to verify they were from iPhone 7 Plus. He described the samples as absolutely gorgeous with no difference between nice point-and-shoot cameras. Depth effect photos are easily sharable and people instantly appreciate their quality. Live Photos, on the other hand, have a slight learning curve and generally only play nice in specific apps. Live Photos were also harder to edit until later software updates. Depth effect photos work with all of the usual editing tools including cropping, rotating, applying filters, and changing color/light/B&W levels. You can’t remove the depth effect after you capture the shot, but by default the Camera app captures a regular photo with the depth effect photo so you can choose which to keep. Using the depth effect feature is pretty simple too. My wife tried it before I got the chance and followed the tips in the Camera app to increase the lighting and find the right distance and focus. It’s a bit odd to see instructions like this in an Apple app, especially in the Camera app, but they’re effective at taking anyone form now really knowing about the feature to taking excellent shots with the blur effect. The way blur effect is artificially applied makes me think of Photoshop and users who edit similar effects in post after a photoshoot. Except with the iPhone 7 Plus, you don’t need Photoshop or professional editing skills. Just follow the guidance in the Camera app and shoot great photos. Move closer to or further from your subject, make sure the lighting is decent, and you see the effect in real time. I’ve noticed already that sometimes I find it hard to choose between the original photo and the blur effect version. My advice is keep both if they’re both good in certain instances. Other times either one or the other is clearly superior. Apple’s Photos app also creates a dedicated album called Depth Effect that only shows photos taken with Portrait mode if you want to only see the new style images. Depth effect has the added benefit of blurring out unwanted background when you shoot. Sometimes the background is exactly what you want. It puts the photo in context. Proves that you were actually at the Grand Canyon! But sometimes the background includes an overflowing trashcan or a pedestrian making a funny face. Blur effect can fight the photo bombers. Portrait mode is a beta feature within a beta operating system, so not everything is perfect yet. Apple can fine tune a lot in software so the feature will likely continue to get better over time, but it’s already quite impressive. I’ve noticed that the Portrait mode has a difficult time properly applying the blur effect when capturing the side of someone’s face. This likely varies on the environment, but in my testing the outline of the face lacked the blur effect. You see it in preview, though, so you don’t waste your time with a bad capture. The more complex the outline of the subject, the harder it is to capture correctly. Because the blur effect relies heavily on a subject being within a certain distance in specific lighting, Portrait mode just isn’t ideal for capturing motion. Portrait mode is optimized to work with people, but it can be difficult to convince a three-year-old to pose still. This was especially clear when snapping my kid swinging at the park. Portrait mode just doesn’t work well with the back and forth fast movement. Burst mode or Live Photos will work better but you’ll miss the blurred background. (Side note on Live Photos with iPhone 7 Plus: switching between 1x and 2x optical zoom is totally captured like other motion so there’s a cool effect to try. Here’s an example.) Finally, Portrait mode does not work with Live Photos. You have to pick one or the other; even the normal photo that Portrait mode can capture isn’t a Live Photo. This is certainly a limitation of the current hardware so I don’t expect this to change. I’ve used my iPhone 6s to shoot photos in some instances when I might have been better off using my Nikon 1 because I love the motion and sound captured with Live Photos. Now that same question of Live Photos or better still photos is back, but this time all on my iPhone. Maybe the iPhone 10 will do it all! Overall, I’m very pleased with what Portrait mode has to offer. I’m also eager to see how much better the already good feature improves throughout the beta and in future software updates. If you rely on your iPhone for most photography and you capture a lot of photos like me, it’s a seriously compelling reason to opt for the iPhone 7 Plus over the smaller model. 1x and 2x optical zoom without using Portrait mode isn’t so bad either: Guides iPhone 7 Apple's iPhone 7 and 7 Plus were announced on 7th September 2016 View THe Guide blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

The S&P 500 financial index dropped 1.11 percent after Bloomberg reported that some hedge funds have withdrawn excess cash and positions held at the German lender. Concerns over the stability of Germany's biggest bank have pushed its shares to record lows and its U.S.-listed stock on Thursday tumbled 6.6 percent. Wells Fargo & Co lost 1.67 percent after U.S. lawmakers rebuked CEO John Stumpf over his handling of sales abuses. Citigroup dropped 1.77 percent and JPMorgan Chase fell 1.47 percent. Apple fell 1.44 percent after Barclays cut its price target. The stock was the biggest drag on Wall Street. The S&P healthcare index lost 1.4 percent and also weighed heavily on the S&P 500 as shares of Merck and Johnson & Johnson declined. "Equity valuations are stretched and priced for perfection," said Mike Baele, managing director with the private client reserve group at U.S. Bank in Portland, Oregon. "I would not be surprised to see additional volatility." The CBOE Volatility Index, a gauge of near-term investor anxiety, jumped 14 percent. At 2:32 pm ET, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 0.85 percent to 18,183.69 points and the S&P 500 had lost 0.65 percent to 2,157.28. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.66 percent to 5,283.58. The S&P utilities index, which is sensitive to interest rates, fell 1.01 percent and was on track for its fifth day of losses in a row. Oil prices were up a day after OPEC members agreed to curb production, even as analysts raised questions about the effectiveness of the deal. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.98-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.49-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 22 new 52-week highs and 4 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 74 new highs and 30 new lows.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Apple is going to open a new research and development center in China, with completion expected by the end of this year, according to DigiTimes. China has become an increasingly important battleground for Apple, where it hopes to increase its mobile market share and get its computers in more hands of the public. DigiTimes said the R&D center is located in Zhongguancun Science Park in Beijing and will employ about 500 people to start. The center is reportedly “focusing on the development of computer software and hardware products, communication, audio and video devices, as well as advanced technologies for consumer electronics products and the information industry,” DigiTimes said. Apple has R&D centers around the world. A larger presence in China may not only make it easier for the company to interact with manufacturing partners in the area, but may also show the government, which doesn’t always trust Apple, that it plans to take positive steps to expand its day-to-day operations within the country, too.

Are Apple’s AirPods really more appealing than the Apple Watch? by Chris Smith 29 September 2016 0 shares Read Comments More people plan to buy the wireless AirPods earphones than the Apple Watch Series 2, according to a new survey. 11 per cent of those quizzed by Bank of America said the W1 chip-enabled buds were on their shopping list. While attracting a little more than 1-in-10 iPhone users doesn’t seem too impressive, it could lead to $3 billion in sales for Apple (via CNET). 56 per cent of those who said 'no' claimed their current headphones were up to scratch, while 40 per cent classed the AirPods as too expensive. 11 per cent worried about maintaining a connection. See also: Apple Watch Series 2 vs Apple Watch When it comes to the Apple Watch, 8 per cent of respondents already owned an Apple Watch, while another 8 per cent planned to buy the new Apple Watch Series 2. 70 per cent of those were current-gen owners, so it appears there’s plenty of interest in upgrading from current users. Apple has split opinion with the AirPods, verging away from both a physical connection and the traditional Bluetooth wireless connectivity. The AirPods have earned praise for their fast and efficient pairing as well as their better-than-expected fit and battery life. However, a consensus appears to be the sound quality doesn’t justify the £159 asking price. In a straight fight between an Apple Watch and Apple AirPods, where’s your money going?

Reprints Reprints Most Popular YouTube has hired Lyor Cohen as its global head of music, entrusting the former Def Jam and Warner Music executive with improving the video site's contentious relationship with the recording industry. Mr. Cohen, who started his career under the tutelage of Def Jam co-founder Russell Simmons, helped shape the music business and pop culture though his work with artists such as Run-DMC, Public Enemy and Ed Sheeran. Most recently, he founded 300 Entertainment, a boutique record label that scored a hit last year with rapper Fetty Wap. After decades of watching new technologies transform the music business and the lives of his artists, Mr. Cohen will help YouTube and its parent Alphabet Inc. refurbish its image with artists. Some of the most powerful musicians have criticized YouTube for not doing enough to protect their copyrights, while labels have fought with the company over their share of revenue from advertising on music clips and videos. Related Stories Spotify, Apple Giving Music Industry a Boost After Decline of Nearly 20 Years Music Playlists Can Now Be Sponsored on Spotify Spotify Said to Be Burying Songs by Artists With Apple Deals YouTube, Sprint CEOs Among Business Leaders Endorsing Clinton "I'm confident that we can bridge the worlds of technology and music in ways that benefit everyone, instead of the zero-sum mentality that exists today," Mr. Cohen wrote in a note to his new team at YouTube. "I'm proud to be a music man, and hope that the perspective I bring from both the creative community and the music business at large will help us, our music partners and artists grow and thrive together." Mr. Cohen will remain in his role at 300 Entertainment until December, when he will join YouTube full-time, reporting to Robert Kyncl, YouTube's global head of business. Two of YouTube's principal rivals, Apple Music and Spotify, already have executives with deep ties to artists and labels. Former Interscope Records boss Jimmy Iovine joined Apple when the technology giant acquired his Beats Electronics. He now runs Apple Music, the second-largest paid music service in the world. Its larger rival Spotify hired Troy Carter, former manager of Lady Gaga and John Legend, earlier this year to improve its often contentious relationship with artists. The growth of those subscription services has boosted music industry revenue for the past year and a half, offsetting declines in sales of physical and digital albums. U.S. streaming revenue grew 57% to $1.6 billion in the first half of 2016 and accounted for almost half of industry sales. Ad-supported streaming accounted for just 12% of that total. Record labels still aren't satisfied with their deals with many services, which they say offer too much for free. No service has inspired more agita than YouTube, which offers more than a billion users free access to millions of songs and music videos. Artists, managers and music organizations have accused YouTube of hiding behind the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which shields YouTube from liability when users upload material that infringes copyrights. The onus is on the rights holder to issue a take down notice. YouTube has rejected this criticism, arguing it has followed the law and policed pirated material with tools like Content ID. Google introduced a paid version of YouTube, YouTube Red, last year, a move widely seen as an olive branch to the music business. -- Bloomberg News In this article: Digital Digital Video Digital Video Entertainment Media Mobile Music Music Social Social Social TV Technology Technology Become a Member Register Now Renew Membership Benefits Datacenter Advertising Age     Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Instagram YouTube Tumblr Copyright © 1994-2016 Crain Communications Privacy Statement Terms of Use About Us Advertise Reprints Contact Us AD AGE Creativity LookBook Datacenter Resources Events Jobs On Campus Site by AREA 17 x Scroll to Continue

Vegan. Think. Eat. Thrive.™ News Food Planet Travel Buzz 7 Vegan Starbucks Drinks Just in Time for Fall By Richard Bowie | September 29, 2016 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Whether youre into coffee, tea, blended beverages, or even butterbeer, were showing you how to make sweater weather even better. Days are getting shorter, the air is more crisp, and sweaters are beginning to make an appearance again. Though the season may be changing, one thing remains the same. We need our coffee. Enter Starbucks. With nearly 24,000 stores worldwide, the green giant is the go-to for an estimated 3 trillion visitors each year. And fall marks a particularly lucrative time for the coffee company, with countless customers streaming in for seasonal beverages such as this year’s Chile Mocha, Salted Caramel Mocha, and the infamous Pumpkin Spice Latte. Unfortunately for vegans … they’re not vegan. But thanks to my eight years as a Starbucks barista, I know a thing or two about coffee, and I’m here to enlighten conscientious consumers about festive, dairy-free coffee concoctions. All you need to keep in mind is to replace dairy with soy, coconut, or (the newly launched) almond milk and to avoid whipped cream, and you’re on your way to caffeination bliss. 1. Salted Caramel Mocha No, this salty-sweet concoction isn’t vegan, but it can easily be modified to fit the bill. The bittersweet chocolate mocha sauce, toffee nut syrup, espresso, and sea salt topping are all permissible. Just substitute the dairy-based caramel drizzle for a pump or two of caramel flavored syrup mixed straight into the drink, and you have a winner. 2. Candy Apple Frappuccino Sugary sweet with real organic apple juice, you’ll be transported to a fall time county fair with each sip of this blended beverage. Simply ask for a crème-based Frappuccino with apple juice filled to the first line, your choice of non-dairy milk to the second, blended with cinnamon dolcé syrup, and a half-pump of raspberry syrup. Turn it into a Caramel Apple by switching out the half-pump of raspberry for a full pump of caramel syrup. 3. Cinnamon Chocolate Chai Starbucks’ original Chai Tea Latte is mix of black tea, spices, pepper, and, unfortunately, honey. But if you opt for the Oprah Cinnamon Chai—a brew developed by O herself, along with a little help from the Starbucks team—you’ll get the full, bold, ginger-cardamom chai experience sweetened with brown sugar instead. Order an Oprah Cinnamon Chai Tea Latte, add pumps of mocha, and top with nutmeg and chocolate powder (also vegan). 4. Hazelnut Apple Tart Frappuccino Another blended creation, let this drink serve as inspiration for the festive vegan pastries you’ll want to bring to Thanksgiving. Start by ordering a Vanilla Bean Frappuccino with one less scoop of vanilla bean powder and substitute with a pump of hazelnut syrup. Have your barista pour apple juice to the second line, add a few shakes of nutmeg, then blend and enjoy. 5. Butterbeer Latte Harry Potter fans will revel in this indulgent blend, but even if you haven’t read the books, you’ll still find it wizarding. Starbucks’ steamed organic vanilla soymilk is recommended because of its creamier, rich mouthfeel. Order a soy latte, add caramel, toffee nut, and cinnamon dolce syrups, top with velvety, whipped foam, and add a bit of sea salt topping to draw out all the sweet butterscotch notes. 6. Toffee Coconut Hot Chocolate Love autumn, but still dreaming of summer? Try this seasonally in-between drink to help you transition to cooler weather with ease. Single-origin Sumatran coconut milk serves as the base to a vanilla and bittersweet chocolate-infused cup of warmth accented with toasty toffee flavors. Simply order a classic Hot Chocolate made with coconut milk and add a couple pumps of toffee nut syrup. 7. Vanilla-Nutmeg Bergamot Tea Latte Delicate and smooth, the oaky-citrus flavors of Earl Grey tea mingle with steamed milk, vanilla bean, and nutmeg in this infusion good enough for a vegan high tea. Order an Earl Grey Tea Latte, with a scoop of vanilla bean powder and shakes of nutmeg added before being steeped, then finished off with steamed almond milk and a layer of foam. Richard Bowie is the Associate Editor at VegNews, an eight-year veteran barista, and has triple-checked that mocha (in company-operated US stores) is vegan.

Apple’s new ad focuses on background animations for Messages Posted Sep 29, 2016 by Romain Dillet (@romaindillet) 0 SHARES Next Story Google’s Cloud Machine Learning service is now in public beta Apple is releasing a new video advertisement for the iPhone and iOS. Like previous ads, this video shows a stark departure from its predecessors. You can feel Tor Myhren’s influence on this ad. The recently hired VP of Marketing Communications has an impressive background in the advertising industry and is now in charge of Apple’s ads. That’s probably the reason why these ads look more polished and try to tell a story compared to last year’s ads. Today’s new ad doesn’t show an iPhone until the last seconds. Instead, Apple slowly reveals what happens when you lose a balloon. At the end, you realize it’s all about the Messages effects in iOS 10. It’s a cute ad and it doesn’t try to sell you a product. It’s more about improving Apple’s branding as iOS 10 is a free download after all. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Apple Founded 1976 Overview Apple is a multinational corporation that designs, manufactures, and markets mobile communication and media devices, personal computers, portable digital music players, and sells a variety of related software, services, peripherals, networking solutions, and third-party digital content and applications.

Posted 29 Sep 2016 22:15 Updated 30 Sep 2016 04:40 Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., September 28, 2016. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS: Wall Street dropped on Thursday, weighed down by Apple as well as selling in Wells Fargo, Citigroup and other major banks as investors worried about the health of Deutsche Bank. The S&P 500 financial index declined 1.49 percent after Bloomberg reported that some hedge funds have withdrawn excess cash and positions held at the German lender. Growing concerns over the stability of Germany's biggest bank have pushed its shares to record lows and its U.S.-listed stock on Thursday tumbled 6.7 percent. "This Deutsche Bank story is really casting a very long shadow over equity markets," said Peter Kenny, senior market strategist at Global Markets Advisory Group, in New York. "In some respects, it speaks to fears over large money-center banks having serious problems, and the last time we had that conversation was the financial crisis." Adding to negative sentiment in the banking sector, Wells Fargo & Co lost 2.07 percent after U.S. lawmakers rebuked CEO John Stumpf over his handling of sales abuses. Citigroup dropped 2.28 percent and JPMorgan Chase fell 1.59 percent. Apple fell 1.55 percent after Barclays cut its price target. The stock was the biggest drag on Wall Street. The S&P healthcare index lost 1.84 percent and also weighed heavily on the S&P 500 as shares of Merck and Johnson & Johnson declined. Among the gainers, Qualcomm jumped 6.3 percent after the Wall Street Journal reported the chipmaker is in talks to buy NXP Semiconductors. NXP surged 16.88 percent. Up 5 percent this year, the S&P 500 is trading near 16 times expected earnings, above its 10-year average of 14, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. "Equity valuations are stretched and priced for perfection," said Mike Baele, managing director with the private client reserve group at U.S. Bank in Portland, Oregon. "I would not be surprised to see additional volatility." The CBOE Volatility Index, a gauge of near-term investor anxiety, jumped 14 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average slid 1.07 percent to 18,143.45 points at the close, its sharpest decline since Sept 13. The S&P 500 lost 0.93 percent to end at 2,151.13 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.93 percent to 5,269.15. The S&P utilities index, which is sensitive to interest rates, fell 1.45 percent, its fifth day of losses in a row. Oil prices were up a day after OPEC members agreed to curb production, even as analysts raised questions about the effectiveness of the deal. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 3.87-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.09-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 22 new 52-week highs and 4 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 82 new highs and 35 new lows. About 7.7 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, above the 7.0 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data.

(Photo : Getty Images/Justin Sullivan) Advertisement The iPad Mini is one of Apple's more demure offerings. With a relatively low price point and more midrange than flagship specs, the Mini is a product that targets a demographic that is quite different from Apple's usual consumer base. Regardless of this, however, the iPad Mini has been a massive success, with the device enjoying much success over the years. Its latest incarnation, the iPad Mini 4, already packs a lot of punch, and now that a year has passed since it launched, rumors are abounding about the possibility of a successor being unveiled soon. iPad Mini 5 Release Date Apple has so far not confirmed the existence or even the development of the iPad Mini 5. However, considering the fact that the iPad Mini 4 was launched more than a year ago, speculations are high that the device would soon be announced. With Apple seemingly gearing up for a massive October event for its updated 2016 MacBook Pro, numerous fans are speculating that the iPad Mini 5 would also be announced in the event. If the tech giant does mention the powerful little tablet on its October event, there is a good chance that Apple might officially release the device in March 2017. This is because, as seen earlier this year, Apple seems to be making March an iPad-focused event. Last March, Apple released the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, and it would not be surprising at all if Apple chooses to do something very similar to the iPad Mini 5. iPad Mini 5 Rumors Numerous rumors have emerged about the iPad Mini 5, and though Apple has not confirmed any of them to date, the speculations are very interesting so far. For one, the device is rumored to be packing powerful internals, possibly along the levels of the iPad Air 2, as well as new innovations such as the absence of a headphone jack and waterproof capabilities. The device is also said to be thinner and stronger, with Apple using the same material the tech giant used in the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus. If these rumors are proven true, then Apple might very well have another winning device on its hands.  © 2016 Enstarz, All rights reserved. Do not reproduce without permission.

Plenty of our readers have asked us: “What exactly is a stock split?” Here’s what you need to know. Andrew Tonner (TMFTheDude) Sep 29, 2016 at 11:33AM Image Source: Getty Image In the world of finance, isn't more always better? Though the answer might seem obvious at first, the reality isn't necessarily so clear -- especially when it comes to stock splits. What exactly is the definition of a stock split? Generally speaking, it's when a company increases (or, in the case of a reverse split, decreases) the number of shares of common stock it has outstanding in a fixed ratio. On the surface, a stock split changes the calculation of earnings per share, and little else. However, the reality is somewhat more nuanced. Here are a few well-known companies that have engaged in stock splits in recent years. Company Ticker Symbol Stock Split Date Stock Split Ratio Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) 4/9/15 2 for 1 Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) 6/9/14 7 for 1 Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) 4/3/14 2 for 1 Data Sources: Starbucks, Apple, Alphabet Each of these businesses split its stock for different reasons, so let's dig a bit more deeply into the rationales that drive these maneuvers. Increasing liquidity? There are numerous reasons why a company might choose to split its stock, but some apply far more commonly than others. Perhaps, the most frequent genesis of a stock split is to provide investors with added liquidity by lowering a company's share price. Here, Starbuck's April 2015 stock split -- its sixth as a publicly traded company -- serves as a useful example. At that time, Starbucks split its stock 2 for 1, cutting its share price in half from about $95 to roughly $48 on the theory that this would make it easier for retail investors to purchase shares in the company, thus increasing its liquidity. In fact, CEO Howard Schultz specifically cited added liquidity as a rationale for the move in the press release announcing the move. "This split is a direct reflection of the past seven years of increasing shareholder value, enhancing the liquidity of our shares, and building an attractive share price," he said. There is mixed evidence suggesting that stock splits help spur short-term rallies in share prices, and some attribute such results in part to the increase in liquidity. More exotic reasons for splits Image Source: Getty Images In mid-2014, tech giant Apple announced it planned to split its stock, giving existing shareholders seven shares for every one they owned. Though it never expressly said so, its motivation appeared to be to lower its share price in order to position itself for entry into the vaunted ranks of the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average index. For context, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is a price-weighted index,  meaning each component company's strength in it is determined by its share price; stocks with higher prices have a greater effect on the Dow's daily movements. At its pre-split share price of roughly $645, Apple would have been far and away the costliest equity in the Dow, giving it too large a sway over the index's behavior. The split gave Dow Jones the ability to add Apple to the prestigious index without having the tech company overpower it -- and it did so in mid-2015. Not all companies with high-cost shares choose to engage in stock splits, though. Here, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway stands as one of the most commonly cited examples. Though it created and has split its Class B shares for some complicated reasons (primarily involving a major acquisition),  Berkshire has famously never split its Class A shares, which carry substantially more voting power. Buffett's thinking on the subject is simple. As he explained to his biographer Alice Schroder, "I don't want anybody buying Berkshire thinking that they can make a lot of money fast... They're not going to do it, in the first place. And some of them will blame themselves, and some of them will blame me. They'll all be disappointed."  This speaks to a broader truth -- namely, that stock splits don't alter anything at the company level. They only increase the numbers of slices in the earnings pie; they don't grow the pie itself. So while they can create temporary gains for investors, stock splits are better viewed as one-off events that don't necessarily improve or diminish the underlying quality of a company.

Image: Radu Bercan/Shutterstock Much loved author of the Game of Thrones series, George RR Martin, has agreed a deal with Apple to bring interactive versions of the books to its iBooks store for their 20th anniversary. Having inspired the hit TV show of the same name, the Game of Thrones book series will now be brought into the digital age with a “world of additional content”. According to The Guardian, the usually publicity-shy Martin has spoken of the deal signed with Apple and the book’s publisher, HarperCollins, as being part of “a new period in the history of publishing”. With the release of A Game of Thrones: Enhanced Edition on iBooks as of yesterday (28 September), readers of the digital book will get access to interactive maps of Westeros and annotated family trees of all the major factions in the series. “Anything that confuses you, anything you want to know more about, it’s right there at your fingertips,” Martin said. “It’s an amazing next step in the world of books.” Release timeline confirmed But perhaps the biggest draw for die-hard fans of the series is the inclusion of an excerpt written by Martin from the next book in the series, The Winds of Winter. Previously published on Martin’s own website temporarily, the new interactive book series will now be the only way to read it. With the first book now released, an interactive book of the sequel, A Clash of Kings, will be released on 27 October. The third book in the series will be the last to be published in 2016, with a release date of 15 December, just in time for Christmas. The fourth and fifth books in the series will then be released in February and March of 2017, respectively. With Martin keeping schtum on the release date of The Winds of Winter, we can expect it to be some time before the release of an interactive version of the sixth novel. Game of Thrones books.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Thursday, 29 September 2016 | MYT 11:45 PM Wall St slips as Apple, healthcare stocks drop At 11:01am. ET (Thursday), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 40.85 points, or 0.22%, at 18,298.39. The Reuters photo shows traders working on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. NEW YORK: Wall Street was lower in choppy trading late Thursday morning, pulled lower by Apple and healthcare stocks. The S&P healthcare index fell 0.7%, marking the second straight day of decline as shares of Merck and Johnson & Johnson booked losses. Apple fell 1.23% after Barclays cut its price target. The stock was the biggest drag on Wall Street. Investors are awaiting Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen’s speech in Washington for clues on the timing of the next interest rate hike. “The markets are taking a step back after a couple of pretty good days,” said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. “It is the end of the quarter so there are people messing around with some positions.” The three indexes have registered gains in the past two days. At 11:01am. ET (1501 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 40.85 points, or 0.22%, at 18,298.39. The S&P 500 was down 4.78 points, or 0.22%, at 2,166.59. The Nasdaq Composite was down 22.79 points, or 0.43%, at 5,295.75. Five of the 11 major S&P indexes were lower, with utilities  falling the most by 1.1%. The sector, which is sensitive to interest rates, is on track to mark its fifth day of losses in a row. Kansas City Fed President and voting member Esther George told CNBC that it was time to move ahead with a rate hike, a stand that Atlanta Fed president Dennis Lockhart echoed. Oil prices were up 0.4%, after Wednesday’s 6% rally, as investors questioned whether an Opec agreement to curb production would be enough to rebalance a heavily over-supplied market. ConAgra was the top percentage gainer on the S&P, rising 7.3% after the company’s profit beat analysts’ estimate. Intra-Cellular plunged 63.2% after the company said its schizophrenia drug did not show any clinically significant difference when compared with placebo.

Noted analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities has added more weight to the suggestion the next-generation Apple handset will make what’s old new again. Specifically Kuo reckons there’ll be glass panels on the front and rear of the device, with stainless steel making up the frame (via 9to5Mac). This was a design last used by Apple for the iPhone 4 and iPhone 5 ranges, although any such implementation within the iPhone 8 would likely look much different. Related: iPhone 8 - Everything you need to know According to the analyst, the glass panel would give the handset a glossy finish, minus the unfortunate 'micro-abrasions' associated with the jet black iPhone 7 model. According to Kuo up to 35% of global iPhone 7 pre-orders have been for the jet black model. Using glass again could enable to add gloss to all color variants of the handset, without the low yield rate of the current jet black aluminium solution fawned over at the Apple keynote earlier this month. While that theory is all well and good, it remains to be seen whether glossy gold and glossy pink iPhones would be as attractive to consumers as the jet black model. Kuo also says there’ll be different type of glass deployed, with 2.5D glass more resilient to edge drops than the current 3D glass. The analyst, who has a better track record than most in these circumstances, also says a stainless steel frame could be reserved for a higher-end model.

(Photo by Debbie Harshman/The Paper � Barry, Ill.) By JUSTIN A. COBB/Pike Press Up-and-coming country music band Broseph E. Lee will headline the Barry Apple Festival for a second year in a row this year and should be a major draw, Meleah Flynn, Apple Festival committee co-chair, said by phone Monday evening.   �We had a really good response to them last year and have had several people ask if they would come back so we booked them again,� Flynn said. �It�s probably the biggest draw other than the car show,� which is expected to feature more than 350 cars this year.   Raised in the Midwest, members of Broseph E. Lee are currently working in Nashville and preparing to go national with the launch of a new album, band publicist April Dickey of The BAND Wagon Publicity said via email Sept. 20.   The band will play Saturday evening, 5:30-8:30 p.m., on the Apple Festival stage, but festivities will begin tomorrow with a �hometown kickoff,� Flynn said   �The town kickoff is just our way of getting the town together right before the festival begins,� Flynn said.   Thursday�s events include an apple pie contest, a performance by the Western High School (WHS) chorus, introduction of the Master Apple Jack, Miss Apple Blossom, and Jr. Miss contestants, and Barry�s Got Talent.   Meanwhile, the 2016 WHS afterprom committee will be serving pulled pork, hotdogs, chips, water, and soda, according to Flynn.   �And, of course, we have our pageants Friday night,� Flynn said.   Contestants will take the stage at 7 p.m. following 6 p.m. opening ceremonies in which special award winners will be recognized, according to Flynn.   Those winners include parade marshal Mike McKenzie, Gold Apple Citizen Marvin Hull, and Friend of the Community Bryan Bower, Debbie Harshman, Apple Festival committee secretary, said via email Monday morning.   In addition to the Barry Apple Festival Queen, Jr. Miss, Little Master Apple Jack, and Little Miss Apple Blossom is the Abe Look-A-Like contest Friday night.   �This year we�re having a presidential or first lady look-alike contest,� Flynn said. �It takes the place of the Sour Apple contest we usually have.�   Participants are asked to dress as a U.S. president or first lady in recognition of this year�s theme, �Past Presidents Celebrating U.S. History,� according to Flynn.   There will be plenty of entertainment for all throughout the Apple Festival weekend.  �And, of course, our apple fritters,� Flynn said. �There are always people standing in line for those.� For more information or to see the full schedule of events, please visit the Barry Apple Festival website at barryapplefestival.com.  submit your comments  Sitemap { Newspaper Website Template by bulletlink.com }

Apple User Says iPhone 7 Exploded Just like the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 GO Still no confirmation that this claim is real or fake Sep 29, 2016 16:23 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  Tech companies are often accused of using each other’s ideas to improve their products, but this time Apple might have copied the wrong feature from Samsung. An exploded iPhone 7 is now making the headlines all over the world, after an Apple customer posted photos of the new model on reddit, claiming that this is exactly how he received the phone. While it’s hard to say if this is a fake claim or not, the redditor explains that “something happened between the factory and delivery,” so the iPhone he received was completed destroyed. There’s something fishy And while we wouldn’t be surprised to see an iPhone 7 exploding due to faulty batteries - after all, defective units can be shipped to pretty much any manufacturer out there - there are several details that don’t seem to align with claims that Apple’s new phone exploded. First of all, if you look very close at the photo, it seems that the box didn’t suffer too much damage, even though the phone clearly exploded. There were claims that the iPhone suffered from overheating in the delivery truck, and if this is the case, the box should be completely wrecked too. At this point, it looks like the iPhone exploded outside the box, but it’s hard to believe that it would have been delivered in such a condition. Then, it looks like the model shown in the photo is a Rose Gold iPhone, but the face seems to be black. The real iPhone in Rose Gold comes with a white face, so there’s a bigger chance that this is a Chinese clone that suffered from overheating. Details are pretty sketchy right now, and even though the redditor posted this screenshot online, he didn’t provide too much information, leaving everyone else asking questions about what exactly happened. For the moment, take this with a pinch of salt, but as a general recommendation, it’s better to always keep an eye on your phone because you never know what happens. Be safe out there! UPDATE: More photos of the exploded iPhone are available and all signs seem to point to damage suffered from external sources. #Apple#iPhone 7#Galaxy Note 7#Samsung#iPhone 7 explosion subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Samsung Galaxy Note 7 Explosions Boost iPhone 7 Sales, Top Apple Analyst Says No Joke: iPhone 7 Owners Try to Create Headphone Jack by Drilling Hole in Phone iPhone 7 Plus Versus Samsung Galaxy Note 7 Real-Life Camera Comparison iPhone 7 Bug Makes Call Audio Sound like “It’s Coming from Behind the Phone” Three UK Hacked, Details of 6 Million Customers at Risk Microsoft Replaces Command Prompt with PowerShell in Latest Windows 10 Build Microsoft Can’t Kill Linux Right Now, The Linux Foundation Director Says iPhone 6 and 6 Plus “Touch Disease” Repairs Cost $149, Apple Says Hacker Breaks into Italian Government Website, 45,000 Users Exposed Samsung Galaxy J3 (2017) Leaks in Press Render NVIDIA Makes Available New GeForce Graphics Hotfix Driver - Version 375.95 Three UK Hacked, Details of 6 Million Customers at Risk    Alleged exploded iPhone 7 new ios apps NeuroNation: Train your brain to improve your memory and focus with NeuroNation Flipagram: Create cool videos by mixing up your photos with music Timer+: Set up dozens of timers and control them all with ease Nutshell Camera: Create some pretty cool videos with Nutshell Camera IKEA Catalogue: Check out the IKEA Catalogue for more than just furniture Complete: Complete puts a social twist to your regular to-do list/ task manager WebMD Baby: WebMD Baby offers help in how to best tend to your baby Reader comments Load old comments   iPhone 6 and 6 Plus “Touch Disease” Repairs Cost $149, Apple Says more on: iPhone 6 touch disease i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

This is a very bullish sign for Apple, says BAML. "12% of the US installed base could lead to up to an incremental $3bn in revenue." Customers who didn't show interest in AirPods cited the adequacy of their current headphones (56%) and cost (40%) as reasons for their lack of interest. Notably, the survey found more customers were planning to purchase AirPods than Apple's smartwatch. "Only a small portion of respondents own the Watch Series 1 and only 8% of respondents intend to buy the Watch Series 2." Are you more excited about Apple AirPods or the new Apple Watch?

Thursday, September 29, 2016 [Tweets] [Favorites] Apple’s iMessage Metadata Logs Juli Clover: Conversations in the Messages app feature end-to-end encryption that makes the content of the messages impossible to decipher, but according to documentation found by The Intercept, Apple tracks who its customers send iMessages to and is able to hand that information over to law enforcement when compelled to do so through a court order. When a text message is sent to someone, the Messages app pings Apple’s servers to see if the person has an iPhone or iPad in an effort to determine whether to send a message via iMessage or SMS. Each ping records date, time, number, and IP address, all of which is kept in a log that Apple says it stores for 30 days. John Gruber: It shouldn’t be surprising that Messages does a lookup on each phone number and email address you attempt to send an iMessage to. If there wasn’t some sort of directory lookup, how would the messages get routed? Here’s Apple’s own description, from their iOS Security Guide[…] Rene Ritchie: My understanding is that, at some point, Apple’s iMessage engineers decided they needed to keep a metadata log in order to detect and fix problems with iMessage dispatch. […] As a result of keeping the log, if presented by a court order, Apple has to turn it over. Same with any log kept by any company. iMessage iOS Mac Privacy Comments Stay up-to-date by subscribing to the Comments RSS Feed for this post.

Thursday, September 29, 2016 [Tweets] [Favorites] The State of Apple Music and Streaming Chance Miller: In terms of numbers, there were an average of more than 18 million music subscriptions during the first half of this year, which is double the number reported at the same time last year. “Music subscriptions are now significantly bigger revenue generators than CD sales, and virtually equal to permanent downloads,” Sherman writes. […] Citing label executives, Bloomberg reports that most Apple Music subscribers are people new to streaming services, not former Spotify users. Spotify is believed to have around 40 million paid users, while Apple has 17 million as of earlier this month. […] Sherman notes that while a song streamed from YouTube is no different for the fan, it’s dramatically different for the artists and labels. Sherman also put Spotify’s free streaming tier in the same boat, noting that the payout differences between free music streaming and paid is “jarring and indefensible.” AAPL.To.Break.$115.Soon.>:-): Spotify was founded about ten years ago and is currently available on 8 OSes and offers a free tier. AppleMusic was started fourteen months ago and is available on 3 OSes and offers no free tier. CelestialTerrestrial: Spotify relies solely on the revenue of their music services, whereas Apple relies on hardware sales for their main source of revenues and profits. No one is profitable with streaming services, yet. Nick Heer: Anecdotally, the recommendations I’ve received from Spotify have generally been more well-rounded in almost all regards, despite using the service less than I do Apple Music or local playback. I also appreciate Spotify’s large variety of community-created playlists. But I’d rather pay for just one streaming service, and I’d prefer to use the one that’s integrated into the applications I use most: Music on iOS, and iTunes on my Mac. Unfortunately, as I’ve written before, its recommendations have been lacklustre. […] It remains a complete mystery to me why the rest of Apple Music’s recommendation features are not using iTunes playback and rating data, nor the previously-collected Genius data. Peter Kirn (via Michael Yacavone): And there, unless you’re a big artist or label, the relationship hasn’t been great, either. I’ve yet to talk to many labels or artists happy with their experience dealing with Apple; by comparison, I’m hearing more positive feedback about Spotify. That’s qualitative and just hearsay, but I can’t find material evidence that Apple Music is a place where smaller- and medium-sized artists see much control. Spotify and Pandora are adding new artist connect features, whereas Apple, as Hypebot noted this month, is backing off of its Connect service. What we get instead is front-and-center machine algorithm streams, despite Apple saying publicly that they’ll do more human curation. Matthew Garrahan et al. (via John Gruber): Spotify, the music streaming service, is in advanced talks to acquire SoundCloud, as competition heats up with Apple for the future of digital music, said people briefed on the discussions. SoundCloud, which raised $100m in June from a group of investors including Twitter, was last valued at about $700m.

Follow TechnoBuffalo The iPhone 7 isn’t even a month old, but iPhone 8 rumors are already flying. Now trusted Apple expert and KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo is back with a fresh set of predictions for next year’s iPhone. Kuo reiterates earlier claims that Apple will switch to an all-glass design for the front and back of the iPhone 8 with a metal frame sandwiched in between. He argues that using glass will allow Apple to offer a glossy exterior similar to the popular Jet Black iPhone 7 while also making the device more scratch resistant. He adds that it could solve the production issues facing the current Jet Black model as well. Apple may also differentiate the iPhone 8 by switching from aluminum to stainless steel. However, Kuo notes that the new material might be limited to premium models. Other phones, like the LG V10 and LG v20, have adopted stainless steel for a more rugged design. KGI previously predicted an all-glass design for the iPhone 8. It’s also suggested Apple could introduce a premium version with a 5.8-inch curved OLED display, while smaller models may stick with LCD. Other reports have claimed the company is working on a totally bezel-free design with the fingerprint scanner and front-facing camera embedded into the display. Apple likely won’t announce the iPhone 8 until almost a year from now, and even the device’s name is still up for debate. We wouldn’t get to attached to any particular rumor for now.

Sheriff Craig Apple said the new facility could be opened to the public for safety training courses. "Today we have a lot of reality based training," Apple said. "I want officers to be able to pull in and be able to shoot often." He said he believes officers who practice using their weapon make smarter choices when deciding whether to use lethal force in the field. Construction is slated to begin at the Coeymans site this fall and the range could open as soon as late spring, Apple said. After various site proposals fell through due to neighborhood complaints about noise, the county is working with a municipality on a $1 long-term lease, Apple said. Land needs to be cleared, berms built and excavation completed once the agreement is finalized, he said. Apple declined to give the exact location until the papers are signed but he described the plot as a secure location that will muffle the sound of gunfire. The range will serve as a practice and qualification site for county deputies on weekdays. "Our agency qualifies more than 400 people a year," Apple said. The range will be open to the public on weekends, with an instructor on site for gun safety courses. Pistol permit applications are at an all time high across the Capitol Region, as gun sales soar nationwide. All pistol permit applicants in New York must attend a private safety course before being processed, but Apple said the county could do more. "At that Saturday class, you're going to sit in a classroom and hear about gun safety but you're not going to shoot a gun, you're not going to hold a gun," he said. "My fear is that people will get their permit and not know how to shoot their gun or handle it properly."

In particular, a refresh of the larger-scale model in the iPhone 7 Plus. The 2016 version of the almost ubiquitous 5.5-inch smartphone from Apple looks much likes its 6S Plus predecessor, except there's a new dual camera, new finishes and new tweaks under the hood too. So has Apple created a flagship device that the faithful will lust after, or is the iPhone 7 Plus merely an incremental update that will leave those looking to upgrade turning elsewhere; and is that wide body just too large for a smartphone? iPhone 7 Plus review: Similar design with some tweaks The new Plus model might come in a similarly designed chassis to the last generation, with the same 5.5-inch screen, but it looks a little different thanks to the more subdued antenna lines, especially when presented in its glossy black ("Jet Black") or matte black ("Black") finishes - which join the gold, rose gold and silver colour options. Pocket-lint The new matte black model is the more stealth option of the two, which we have on review here. The finish, which replaces the so-called Space Grey option, is less likely to be prone to smudges and scratches than the gloss black and is a much blunter-looking finish compared to the whimsical rose gold and gold colours. It's like a matte Bentley Continental - and certainly our choice of the two new blacks available (we also review the gloss black iPhone 7 here). By contrast, the gloss is a fingerprint-magnet, reminiscent of the iPhone 3G - but made from metal instead of plastic. Apple iPhone 7 vs iPhone 7 Plus: What's the difference? On the lighter colour models the new antenna design is more apparent, but it no longer cuts through the metal back plate design like it once did. It now wraps around the top edge of the phone rather than intersecting top and bottom. In our matte black model, it's hardly noticeable. Pocket-lint New finishes aren't the only design changes though. The headphones socket has been dumped (yep, no 3.5mm jack here - it's all about wireless or Lightning connector) and replaced with a speaker grille, while the physical Home button has also been changed from a solid state one to one that doesn't move. Those changes mean Apple can now waterproof the iPhone to IP67 standard, meaning you'll be able to get it wet without it being the end of the world. Yep, dropping your phone down the toilet or in the swimming pool isn't going to be the major headache it once was - but we still wouldn't recommend swimming with it. The waterproof rating is 30-minutes in up to a metre of water. Apple iPhone 7 Plus review: Cameras The big differentiator between iPhone 7 Plus and the "standard" iPhone 7 is the introduction of a dual-camera setup in the Plus model. We've seen dual cameras before in devices, from the LG G5's wide and super-wide lenses, to the Huawei P9's colour and monochrome sensors. But Apple does take a different approach to how other manufacturers are tackling it, by offering one wide-angle lens (23mm f/1.8 equivalent), and one standard lens (56mm f/2.8 equivalent; Apple likes to call it "telephoto", but that focal length equivalent is about as close to a standard lens as you can get). The reason for these two lenses is two fold: one, to resolve greater detail of farther-away subjects; two, to offset the depth data between the two lenses to be create a depth map to create a soft blur to backgrounds via software. This new setup also means the iPhone 7 Plus is capable of digital zoom to a 230mm equivalent (that's 10x the wide-angle lens), while being able to resolve more detail than its equivalent wide-angle competitors. Pocket-lint The cameras protrude out the back of the iPhone 7 Plus but sports a more accentuated rectangular design than its predecessor - meaning your old cases are unlikely to fit. That's something else for the shopping list. The protrusion is visible and pronounced enough to make the phone wobble when laid on a desk or table. The iPhone 7 Plus has a number of other camera-focused features, too, including a Quad-LED True Tone flash, body and face detection, and wide colour capture for photos and Live Photos. The front camera also sees an increased resolution to 7-megapixels with an aperture of f/2.2. Like the iPhone 7, the camera in the Plus is very good. It has optical image stabilisation (OIS), as before, and the colour in all our test shots just looks natural; the camera auto-detects and handles exposures well for different situations; there's detail in the close-up shots we've snapped; and those wide apertures don't overdo things - so farther-away subjects remain crisp, while close-up subjects get that lovely blurred background effect. Pocket-lint However, we can still see grain in some areas (we're talking when zoomed in to 100 per cent) and images look better on the phone at smaller scale than they do on a larger computer monitor. Some processing does smear away some finer detail, too, such as the thread in a shirt, as one example. For those really wanting to take things to the next level, you can now shoot raw, but Apple has held back from adding that capability to its own Camera app, so you'll need a third-party app to get access to that feature. iPhone 7 Plus review: 2x Zoom In the iPhone 7 Plus's Camera app the second camera is represented with a single "2x" icon that you can tap at any time to instantly switch from wide-angle to standard lens. A longer press means you can zoom beyond the optical zoom available and achieve up to 10x digital zoom (or 5x digital zoom from the longer focal length lens). Designed to be used one-handed, by pressing and then moving your thumb in an arc, this zoom option works really well in practice. Pocket-lint However, the zoom feature is a novelty that you'll probably find yourself using at the kid's school play because you weren't able to get in the front row. It certainly gets you closer to the action, but so does walking forward too. As for the digital zoom results, these are as you might expect: less detailed. Ever since digital camera manufacturers have been putting digital zoom on cameras we've recommended against its use. Zooming in digitally means you're effectively enlarging the pixels available from the sensor and making up the gaps in-between, which reduces the overall quality and sharpness of the resulting image. Our advice remains the same: if you really must get closer then walk forward a bit, or crop a touch after shooting (just not to the extreme of 10x, otherwise the results will be largely the same). iPhone 7 Plus review: Depth Effect Beyond basic zoom controls, which can be used in any of the camera's shooting modes (including video), Apple has also tried to be clever by utilising the results of both lenses together to create what it calls "Depth Effect". This is for use in Portrait mode only (that's from the 56mm standard lens only, not the wide-angle 23mm one). Pocket-lint Depth Effect is designed to deliver a more DSLR-like photo with a shallower depth of field (read: softer, out-of-focus background) by creating a depth map comparison of what the two differing lenses see in front of them. This allows software to digitally blur the background, which it identifies as being farther away, while keeping the foreground sharp. Or at least that's the idea. Disappointingly, the new feature isn't available yet in iOS 10, but can be found in the iOS 10 Public Beta. Even then, the new feature is in beta as well - yes a beta in a beta. It's all very meta. Because of that, you'll have to take the results as a work in progress, as using it can be hit a miss. Unlike the incredibly simple-to-use photo shooting modes already available, Portrait mode comes with a number of caveats: you'll need plenty of light, to be the right distance away from your subject with ample distance from the background, to have lots of contrast between the foreground and the background, for there to be not too many faces in the picture, oh, and for your subjects to stay still. This is no snap-and-go offering. Pocket-lint The blurred background effect - which pros know as bokeh, but we jovially call "faukeh" when it's being produced by software - happens in real-time on the iPhone 7 Plus's screen so you can see what's going on. At the end you get a Depth Effect picture in place, plus one without the effect so you can see the difference. At times the system gets confused and gives you a blurry shot, but on the whole, and with practice, we've got some fairly good results. We've found that the farther your subject is from the background, the more pronounced the blur effect will be; while you'll notice better blur if you have good contrast between your subject and the background such as contrasting colours. It's clear to see why the feature is a beta in a beta though. The software algorithm is a tough one to crack - and one that no manufacturer has managed so far, Apple included. Subjects can be very soft, foreground details such as hair blurred unnecessarily, details skewed, and, to a trained eye, rather disappointing. Pocket-lint There are times when the algorithm goes way over the top, too, more so than you would ever be able to create using an equivalent lens on a DSLR, and it shows that phone cameras, no-matter how impressive in their normal use, still have some way to go when creating pictures with a pronounced shallow depth of field. For most the Depth Effect results from Portrait mode will be good enough to share on screen, but if you are looking to print them out, then they're likely to have digital imperfections and blurred areas that don't reflect photographic reality - and that you may not be happy with. The good news is that it's promising stuff, but as even Apple points out, it's still not truly ready for primetime. It's not a feature you should buy the phone for, yet. iPhone 7 review: New Home button The Home button is one of the most used elements of the iPhone's design, and upon hearing Apple was ditching the physical "click" element and replacing it with the same technology found in the Apple Watch and MacBook trackpad, we were worried. Thankfully, in practice, it's really good. The button is as responsive as you want it to be and still allows you to flawlessly use it for double-tapping or Touch ID sign-in. Pocket-lint Tap the button and the so-called Taptic Engine inside the phone vibrates - making you believe that the button is moving when in reality it isn't. You can prove it's all "magic" by turning the phone off and seeing that the button really doesn't move. The Home button offers three sensitivity settings to make it as responsive as you prefer. Although Apple says that it hasn't updated the responsiveness of the button compared to the 6S models, with a faster processor and optimised iOS 10, it certainly feels quicker to react. Gushing to say this, but once you try it, you'll wonder why Apple hadn't changed the Home button earlier. iPhone 7 review: Taptic Engine The same Taptic Engine as used to convince you the Home button is physically moving is also used to greater affect across the new iOS 10 user interface. Pocket-lint Playing Codemaster's F1 2016 game, for example, we could feel the nuances of the crashing into the barriers or going over bumps throughout the phone. The same goes with other Taptic-enabled apps. Feeling your phone is going to be a thing now - whether that's just rolling through the dials on a timer or playing with the Noise app by Roli. We are looking forward to seeing how much of a difference it will make to everyday use. iPhone 7 review: Audio Yes, Apple has ditched the headphone socket. There's no 3.5mm jack on the iPhone 7 Plus. For those somewhat panicked by that move, a Lightning-to-3.5mm adapter is included in the box if you aren't going wireless, which means you can use your existing wired headphones. Or plug in Lightning connector headphones for the best wired experience and sound quality. Pocket-lint Where the 3.5mm socket was on the iPhone 6S Plus is now replaced with a speaker in the 7 Plus. That means the new phone features stereo sound from speakers at the top and bottom, which gives a better out-loud audio experience. The speakers are more than good enough for listening or watching - whether that's Netflix, YouTube, or a game. During our testing we've been using the quick-pairing AirPods (which aren't included in the box, they're £159 extra) and a range of other headphones. All work seamlessly. Apple AirPods review: Wire free future or design disaster? iPhone 7 review: Speed and performance A new iPhone means upgraded speed. The iPhone 7 Plus gets the new Apple A10 Fusion processor that promises to increase the power and performance over previous iPhones. Ultimately, it means your phone will be able to load things faster, process things faster, and generally not be in any way sluggish. Over the last couple of weeks using the iPhone 7 Plus it has been as zippy as you would expect, loading powerful games and processing video with minimal effort. Pocket-lint It's got more RAM than the standard iPhone 7, so is the one to go for if you're a gamer. However, the phone still gets hot when playing demanding games though for long periods of time. The screen - which is the same 5.5-inch size and 1920 x 1080 resolution as the iPhone 6S Plus - also feels a lot brighter and more responsive, but Apple has held back from adding the Tru Display technology found on the iPad Pro 9.7. Apple iPhone 7 review: iOS 10 The new iPhone comes with the latest operating system, iOS 10, as standard. Like the hardware refinements, this new software experience is a subtle change over what users will have seen in iOS 9. iOS 10 comes with a number of new features like a dedicated Home app to allow you to control and manage your HomeKit accessories, a much more advanced Messages app that bring things like apps and stickers, and Widgets to the lock screen so you can quickly grab information snippets from your favourite apps (if they are supported).   Apple iOS 10 review: Bringing more complexity and features to your iPhone and iPad The notion that iOS is a simple operating system is now a long and distant memory, given the complexity it opens up for power users. In iOS 10 Apple has focused on layering the experience with even more complexity and depth than ever before. In the same breath, if you're not a phone geek it's still a breeze to use. The iPhone 7 Plus still gets a couple of dedicated features including a landscape home screen, and expanded keyboard functionality, which makes sense for a device of this scale. iPhone 7 Plus review: Battery life Apple made a fairly big song and dance over how the battery life had improved for the iPhone 7 range following efficiencies in processor and software performance. We didn't see gains on the iPhone 7, but with the iPhone 7 Plus the gains are more prevalent. Pocket-lint The iPhone 7 Plus battery lasts more than a whole day, with light use, and unlike the iPhone 7 doesn't drain as fast when using social networking or chat apps. A full day with plenty of messages will see you still with a good 30 per cent battery for the last train home. As always, how you use your phone will determine how long the battery lasts. Messing around with Depth Effect shots in the camera soon gobbles battery, as does playing games, but the iPhone 7 Plus is a lot more forgiving with heavy usage than its smaller brother. Verdict Of the two new iPhone 7 devices, the Plus certainly gets the most new features - making it the more worthy upgrade from either the iPhone 6 Plus or the iPhone 6S Plus. The core design of the iPhone 7 Plus isn't an overhaul though, it's about refinement, with subtle changes - the new Home button and glossy/matte black finishes with better hidden antennas - elevating the design without tearing up the rule book and starting again. The lack of a headphone jack will either infuriate you or go unnoticed. The biggest change is with the cameras. Sure, the Depth Effect is a work in progress, but it doesn't have to be used and doesn't take away from the cameras' overall excellence. Ultimately it's the resulting images that are great, and the 2x optical zoom functionality is welcomed. However, as we've always said of the Plus range, it's a big and heavy device that will divide opinion because of its wide body. Equally, it's an incredibly well-built device that won't disappoint - especially on the power and battery life fronts - because you'll be hard pushed to find a smartphone as capable and well-rounded elsewhere.

Getting Inside the Apple Inc. iPad Apple's current relationship with Imagination Technologies won't easily be broken. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Sep 29, 2016 at 10:30AM Image source: NVIDIA.  In a recent column published by Seeking Alpha, contributor Mark Hibben offered up his commentary on the news (first published here) that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) may opt to use graphics processors from graphics specialist NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) in future Mac products. As part of this commentary, he made the following observation: Since Nvidia already features its Pascal [graphics processing unit] in its ARM-based Parker Tegra processor, I can see Apple turning to Nvidia for GPU licensing in future A series SOCs. An Apple iPad with Nvidia graphics would offer unrivaled graphics. Although this possibility seems interesting, I don't think we'll see it happen anytime soon (if ever). NVIDIA's GPUs are powerful, but Apple has been doing a fine job The graphics processors that Apple includes in its iPad-specific processors, which are implementations of technologies developed by Imagination Technologies (NASDAQOTH:IGNMF), tend to be best in class. According to tests performed by AnandTech, the A9X inside of the 12.9-inch iPad Pro far and away outperforms any other mobile processor in many graphics tests (including 3DMark Sling Shot, GFXBench 3.0, and Basemark ES 3.1). That includes the graphics processor inside of NVIDIA's own Tegra X1 system-on-a-chip (though to be fair, the X1 came out first and is built on an older manufacturing technology, putting it at a disadvantage to the A9X). In August, NVIDIA gave out the first details of its next generation Tegra processor, code-named Parker. This is a part manufactured in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's (NYSE:TSM) 16-nanometer technology (putting it on manufacturing process parity with the A9X) and could very well take the mobile graphics performance crown from Apple. However, it's important to note that the A9X is nearly a year old at this point and is likely to be replaced by the A10X in early 2017. With the A10X I would not be surprised to see Apple take the mobile graphics processor performance crown back from NVIDIA (especially since the A10X is likely to be manufactured in TSMC's newer 10-nanometer technology). The point of this discussion isn't to disparage NVIDIA's Tegra efforts. Rather, the purpose is to show that -- at least when it comes to graphics processors integrated into tablet-class processors -- Apple is already fielding leadership products. Based on this, it's really tough to make a compelling case for Apple to ditch Imagination's offerings for NVIDIA's. What could compel Apple to switch? Nothing is impossible, and I can imagine a scenario under which Apple does switch from Imagination's graphics processors to NVIDIA's. It would essentially come down to NVIDIA putting together significantly more powerful and power efficient solutions than what Imagination would be able to provide. That said, a single generation of leadership isn't likely to be enough to seal the deal. I believe that Apple would have to look at both companies' long-term graphics processor road maps and come to the conclusion that NVIDIA is not only going to take the efficiency lead in one generation, but sustain (or, preferably, grow) that lead out in time. NVIDIA's graphics processors have gotten much more efficient over the years (in the world of graphics processors targeted at personal computers, NVIDIA is generally believed to have the most power efficient solutions available), but Imagination isn't sitting still. Further, I would imagine that Apple has significant influence on Imagination's technology road map. Not only is Apple a key customer of Imagination's graphics technologies, but Apple actually owns a significant portion of Imagination. I'm not saying it's impossible for NVIDIA or another graphics processor vendor (such as ARM Holdings) to displace Imagination, but it'd be exceedingly difficult to do so. As such, I don't recommend current or potential NVIDIA shareholders to invest in the company's stock on the basis of a potential deal to supply intellectual property to Apple for its iDevices.

More Tech The inevitable happened: iPhone 7 gets a headphone jack case By Matthew Humphries 09.29.2016 :: 6:26AM EST @mthwgeek Apple likes to talk about how magical, amazing, and “the best ever” its latest gadgets are, but with the iPhone 7 it’s turning out to be one of the most frustrating, infuriating, control-grabbing version of the smartphone the company has created. And that’s down to one simple reason. No, not courage. The removal of the headphone jack. You can continue to use your existing headphones if you don’t mind an adapter hanging out of your phone. Or you could upgrade to some Lightning headphones if you have the cash and can find some you like. Or you could embrace Apple’s Earpods if they were actually available and didn’t cost a small fortune. But fear not iPhone 7 and 7 Plus owners! The inevitable has happened. A case has been created that adds a headphone jack back into the equation. Not only that, but it also extends battery life while offering scratch and shock protection. It’s called the Fuze Case and it has appeared on Indiegogo attempting to generate $60,000 of funding. Super early birds can grab a Fuze Case for $49, with the price increasing to $59 and then $69 once those early slots have all been filled. Here’s the less than great Indiegogo video: The Fuze Case works by simply integrating the 3.5mm audio jack to Lightning adapter into the bottom on the casing. It makes the iPhone 7 longer and fatter, but removes the need for a separate adapter completely. As for the extended battery, the iPhone 7 version of the case includes a 2,400mAh battery, where as the 7 Plus squeezes in a 3,600mAh battery. If you’re tempted, the cases are expected to ship in December by which point you may have already lost your headphone adapter or given in and purchased some Lightning headphones or EarPods.

Home Entertainment BellaNaija Ladun Liadi Linda Ikeji Nigerian Newspapers Daily Times Guardian Newspaper National Mirror Punch Newspaper The Nation Newspaper Nigerian Pilot Newspaper Vanguard Newspaper Nigeria News PM News Premium Times TV Stations Channels TV Lagos Television TVC News TV Continental Videos Music Videos Notjustok Tooxclusive News Videos YOHAIG Think YOruba HAusa IGbo BlackBerry lesson: adapt or die in the internet Age Posted September 29, 2016 3:26 pm by admin Comments BlackBerry has joined Yahoo, Nokia and other technology industry stars felled by an internet age in which companies are forced to evolve quickly or perish. Canadian-based BlackBerry announced Wednesday it would halt in-house production of smartphones, marking the end of an era for the once-dominant handset producer. Originally known as Research in Motion, the company earned a dedicated following of “CrackBerry” addicts and introduced millions to the smartphone. But, its luster faded with the introduction of the iPhone in 2007 and the large number of low-costs Android handsets that followed. BlackBerry travelled a road well-worn. Finland’s Nokia, once the world’s largest mobile phone maker, has seen its smartphone business go up in smoke as well. Internet pioneer Yahoo recently inked a deal to sell its core business to US telecommunications firm Verizon after years of struggling in vain to revive growth in an online search market usurped by Google. “What they have in common is that they haven’t reacted well to rapid change from their original positions,” said Endpoint Technologies Associates analyst Roger Kay. “Tech has high velocity.” The tech sector is young and fast-moving in an internet culture that praises “disruption” and “revolution” of industries and lifestyles. Among mottos found on the walls of leading social network Facebook is “Move fast and break things.” Smartphones themselves have become seemingly indispensible, with people typically replacing handsets every year or two in order to have the newest features or capabilities. – Resting on laurels – Changing to capitalize on a new trend can be daunting for companies comfortable with products that keep revenue flowing for the moment. “It reminds me of all those old singers going to Las Vegas to do whatever it is they do when they should really have just stopped,” Kay said of tech companies sticking with what early hits. “Everybody wants to do an encore and get paid again.” When Apple launched the iPhone in 2007, some critiques questioned why the California company was “cannibalizing” its successful line of iPods. The iPhone became a global sensation, and a main driver of stellar profit for Apple. Kay noted that when Yahoo ruled internet search it became clear their model was under attack by a newcomer called Google. Yahoo may not have seen the threat, or may have blinded itself to the need for change because its old business model continued to pump revenue, according to Kay. And while there are individual specifics underlying the downfall of incumbent mobile phone titans, they all faced the sudden and simultaneous rise of two powerhouses Apple disrupted smartphones and lifestyles with its iPhone, and Google fired back with an Android mobile operating system that any consumer electronics maker was free to use. The Google and Apple one-two punch was enough to essentially “pivot” a smartphone market that incumbents thought was too stable to rattle, according to independent Silicon Valley analyst Rob Enderle. “None of the big firms were prepared to deal with it,” Enderle said of two companies new to the smartphone scene fueling a revolution. Unlike the birth of search engine Google on a young and growing internet, mobile phones were an existing market that incumbents felt they knew well and were “completely taken aback b the combination of Apple and Google,” according to Enderle. – Reinvention – Veteran technology firms being overtaken by newcomers is not necessarily inevitable, if established companies have the wit and courage to re-invent themselves, adapting to survive. Analyst Kay noted IBM, a century-old technology company that has embraced transformation time and again, even shedding products along the way. Computer chip giant Intel shifted its focus to microprocessors for mobile devices to adapt to how internet-connected devices were evolving. Apple itself was a computer company on the brink of bankruptcy when it staked its future on iPods and iPhones in a winning move that made it one of the most profitable companies on the planet. The future is a question mark for Microsoft, once the world’s largest company, which has fallen behind Apple and Google as the PC industry declines and which is refocusing on enterprise services. But reinvention isn’t a cure-all, and needs ongoing commitment to change along with vision of where markets are heading. IBM now seems tangled in endless restructuring, with revenue declining for more than four years; Intel continues to struggle to find the kind of success it had with big computer chips. Analysts have taken to wondering whether Apple itself has become too dependent on the iPhone, and is taking too long to come up with “the next big thing.” AFP The post BlackBerry lesson: adapt or die in the internet Age appeared first on Punch Newspapers.

Spotify is reportedly in "advanced talks" to acquire online audio distribution platform SoundCloud, according to the Financial Times, which cites "people briefed on the discussions." The move is intended to compete against rivals like Apple Music, which now has 17 million users to Spotify's 40 million paid subscribers. As the FT notes, Soundcloud backers include Twitter, which made a $70 million investment this summer. Spotify and SoundCloud declined to comment on the rumors. In March, SoundCloud launched a new $10 monthly subscription service. But it will likely be difficult for the service to compete with the likes of Spotify, which just this week launched in Japan. //Related Articles Add Spotify Tunes to Your Tinder Profile Available on an invite-only basis for mobile, desktop, and PlayStation users, Spotify Japan comes in free ad-supported or 980 yen-per-month ad-free subscription plans. The program features a number of familiar functions, including Discover Weekly and Release Radar, as well as new elements like curated playlists from Spotify's local team. Plus, Japanese listeners can tap into karaoke-style song lyrics on mobile—making its global debut—alongside desktop lyric support. Local music fans can go online to request an invitation, or just wait for Spotify to roll out to all users in Japan.

(Kiichiro Sato | AP) Print Email Geoff Herbert | gherbert@syracuse.com By Geoff Herbert | gherbert@syracuse.com The Post-Standard Email the author | Follow on Twitter on September 29, 2016 at 11:34 AM comments Earlier this year, Apple opposed a court order to help the FBI hack into an iPhone used by a gunman in a mass shooting in California. A month later, officials said they successfully hacked the smartphone without Apple's help, but wouldn't say how. Apple says iMessages -- text messages sent from Apple devices to other Apple devices -- are encrypted and cannot be viewed by the company. CEO Tim Cook said building software to break the encryption would just invite "criminals, terrorists and hackers... to go to considerable lengths to steal it." A new report, however, says some data in iMessages is tracked by Apple -- and can be shared with the police. The Intercept obtained a document from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement's Electronic Surveillance Support Team that shows the iPhone and iPad maker keeps a log of which phone numbers users are contacting and potentially other metadata, including location. The document, titled "iMessage FAQ for Law Enforcement," reveals Apple servers record a check of contact information to determine if texts, photos and videos are being sent to other devices via standard SMS text messaging or through Apple's iMessages The encrypted iMessages are not visible to Apple and cannot be turned over to authorities, but the log of contacts can be shared with law enforcement when the company is compelled to do so by a court order. Mashable reports the log also includes the date and time that a user entered the phone number, along with their IP address. Apple said in 2013 it does "not store data related to customers' location," but the IP addresses can help authorities determine where someone was when they attempted to contact another person. Apple confirmed to The Intercept that it does retain those logs, but only for a period of 30 days. According to Mashable, the logs, known as Pen Registers, are common on smartphones. Court orders for the data, known as Trip and Trace requests, may be extended in additional 30-day periods and police could determine phone numbers entered by Apple users over several months. The messages are still encrypted and can only be viewed by senders and recipients. Authorities also cannot determine whether messages were actually sent to the recipients in the Pen Registers. "When law enforcement presents us with a valid subpoena or court order, we provide the requested information if it is in our possession. Because iMessage is encrypted end-to-end, we do not have access to the contents of those communications. In some cases, we are able to provide data from server logs that are generated from customers accessing certain apps on their devices," Apple said in a statement. "We work closely with law enforcement to help them understand what we can provide and make clear these query logs don't contain the contents of conversations or prove that any communication actually took place." It still remains unclear how the FBI hacked the iPhone used by Syed Farook when he and his wife died in a gun battle with police after shooting and killing 14 people in San Bernardino, Calif. in December. The U.S. Justice Department said in March it was reviewing information on the phone in its investigation. Store Front Retail business news The latest Syracuse and CNY commercial and retail news. ...

Posted 29 Sep 2016 22:15 Updated 30 Sep 2016 04:40 Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., September 28, 2016. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS: Wall Street dropped on Thursday, weighed down by Apple as well as selling in Wells Fargo, Citigroup and other major banks as investors worried about the health of Deutsche Bank. The S&P 500 financial index declined 1.49 percent after Bloomberg reported that some hedge funds have withdrawn excess cash and positions held at the German lender. Growing concerns over the stability of Germany's biggest bank have pushed its shares to record lows and its U.S.-listed stock on Thursday tumbled 6.7 percent. "This Deutsche Bank story is really casting a very long shadow over equity markets," said Peter Kenny, senior market strategist at Global Markets Advisory Group, in New York. "In some respects, it speaks to fears over large money-center banks having serious problems, and the last time we had that conversation was the financial crisis." Adding to negative sentiment in the banking sector, Wells Fargo & Co lost 2.07 percent after U.S. lawmakers rebuked CEO John Stumpf over his handling of sales abuses. Citigroup dropped 2.28 percent and JPMorgan Chase fell 1.59 percent. Apple fell 1.55 percent after Barclays cut its price target. The stock was the biggest drag on Wall Street. The S&P healthcare index lost 1.84 percent and also weighed heavily on the S&P 500 as shares of Merck and Johnson & Johnson declined. Among the gainers, Qualcomm jumped 6.3 percent after the Wall Street Journal reported the chipmaker is in talks to buy NXP Semiconductors. NXP surged 16.88 percent. Up 5 percent this year, the S&P 500 is trading near 16 times expected earnings, above its 10-year average of 14, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. "Equity valuations are stretched and priced for perfection," said Mike Baele, managing director with the private client reserve group at U.S. Bank in Portland, Oregon. "I would not be surprised to see additional volatility." The CBOE Volatility Index, a gauge of near-term investor anxiety, jumped 14 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average slid 1.07 percent to 18,143.45 points at the close, its sharpest decline since Sept 13. The S&P 500 lost 0.93 percent to end at 2,151.13 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.93 percent to 5,269.15. The S&P utilities index, which is sensitive to interest rates, fell 1.45 percent, its fifth day of losses in a row. Oil prices were up a day after OPEC members agreed to curb production, even as analysts raised questions about the effectiveness of the deal. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 3.87-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.09-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 22 new 52-week highs and 4 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 82 new highs and 35 new lows. About 7.7 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, above the 7.0 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data.

As part of the joint effort, Deloitte is creating a first-of-its-kind Apple practice with over 5,000 strategic advisors who are solely focused on helping businesses change the way they work across their entire enterprise, from customer-facing functions such as retail, field services and recruiting, to R&D, inventory management and back-office systems. Apple and Deloitte will also collaborate on the development of a new service offering from Deloitte Consulting called EnterpriseNext, designed to help clients fully take advantage of the iOS ecosystem of hardware, software and services in the workplace. The new offering will help customers discover the highest impact possibilities within their industries and quickly develop custom solutions through rapid prototyping. “We know that iOS is the best mobile platform for business because we’ve experienced the benefit ourselves with over 100,000 iOS devices in use by Deloitte’s workforce, running 75 custom apps,” said Punit Renjen, CEO of Deloitte Global, in a statement. “Our dedicated Apple practice will give global businesses the expertise and resources they need to empower their mobile workforce to take advantage of the powerful ecosystem iOS, iPhone and iPad offer, and help them achieve their ambitions, while driving efficiency and productivity.” “As the leader in digital transformation strategy, Deloitte is an ideal partner that brings a team of Apple-dedicated strategic advisors to help clients truly revolutionize how they work using iOS, iPhone and iPad,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO, in a statement. “iPhone and iPad are transforming how people everywhere get work done.

Sources: Apple Inc. and Deloitte Consulting LLP MacDailyNews Take: Apple means business™. BTW, IT doofuses, we told ya so, 10 days before Apple sold their first iPhone: The IT guys are in for a rude awakening and the iPhone is only the beginning. They will have to accommodate the iPhone. Too many important employees will demand it and IT won’t be able to stem the tide. The fact is that business people will decide which device they want to carry and their businesses will adapt to it. Just as they did with “Microsoft-incompatible” Research In Motion’s Blackberry. Apple’s iPhone will be a success with business users whether the IT guy wants it or even whether AT&T and Apple tailor marketing to businesses or not. Note to CEOs: Who runs the company, you or the IT guy? It’s your job to make the decisions and it’s the IT guy’s job to implement your decisions that relate to technology. Just as with Macs, you need to educate yourself instead of relying on someone with their own, possibly hidden, agendas to make extremely important technology decisions for your company. Most of you could be saving a LOT of money right now, but you aren’t because you’ve delegated an important part of your company’s decision-making to people who, frankly, in our experience, aren’t capable of making good, sound, strategic, long-term decisions. Most IT guys (and we know many) are not open-minded enough to be able to consider new, better, more efficient, more effective options that would benefit your company. In fact, most IT guys we’ve met will throw up road blocks and repeat myths until they’re blue in the face in order to avoid change. Especially change that might make their department less critical or smaller. Bottom line: most of you CEOs have given the IT guy way, way, way too much power. It’s time to take it back. — MacDailyNews, June 19, 2007 Categories: News Tags: Apple, business, corporate, Deloitte Consulting, enterprise, EnterpriseNext, iOS, macOS, tvOS, WatchOS Thank You for supporting MacDailyNews!

Mike Wednesday, September 28, 2016 - 5:14 pm · Reply Apple’s iOS will evolve into one of many tools that enterprises use for communication. It is absolutely not the only one necessary to run a business. Apple can’t even run its own business on its own technologies, what does that tell you? MDN, you seem to buy the kool aid that CEOs are all-knowing savants who can make clairvoyant technical decisions. They are not. A CEO, despite the insane compensation thrown at them, are only as good as the executive team supporting him/her. That team notably includes a CTO, the “IT Guy”, who almost invariably is given hard budget constraints that prevent a massive change away from the entrenched tools. Change costs money. You want an all-Apple office, please explain how that saves money in the short term or the long term. iOS currently works great for phones. It’s useless for collaboration work at an enterprise level. It’s so easy to throw CTOs under the bus when you have zero experience in business. thetheloniousmac Thursday, September 29, 2016 - 3:46 am · Reply Gee. Thanks a lot MDN. It is my experience, BTW, that it is the CEO who opposes the iPAD along with other key management personnel and employees. Even after you demonstrate that the device can handle most if not all business functions, they remain highly skeptical of a very expensive but under powered device that they have to learn to use.

Apple to Launch New iPhone With Glass Casing and Stainless Steel Frame Next Year [Report] LIKE   TWEET   SHARE   PIN   SHARE   POST MAIL MORE Posted September 29, 2016 at 3:15pm by iClarified · 10053 views · Translate Apple is planning to launch a new iPhone with a curved OLED display and a glass casing next year, says KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo in a new report. Kuo believes the popularity of the glossy Jet Black iPhone 7 will encourage Apple to return to glass as it has a higher gloss finish than metal. While a glossy finish is possible for metal casing, we identify two prerequisites for the 2017 new iPhone to be competitive in terms of casing design, considering competitors will definitely launch smartphone models with glossy metal or glass casing prior to Apple’s launch: (1) adoption of a glossy finish design; (2) enhanced productivity and higher yield will prevent a supply shortage, as has happened with jet black casing, which is manufactured at an unsatisfactory yield rate of 60-70% due to the metal material; and (3) better scratch resistance will improve user satisfaction. All things considered, we see glass casing as the only option. Kuo says Apple will likely stick to a slightly curved 2.5D cover glass to maintain high production yields and better drop test performance. The glass casing will be reinforced by an aluminum metal frame and a new stainless steel frame will reportedly be used for high end models. Metal frame can be stainless steel or aluminum, with former more likely for high-end models. As all-glass casing is not possible at present given technological bottlenecks, a metal frame surrounding the edge is necessary for reinforced structure design. As stainless steel has a better look than aluminum and costs more, we expect only high-end new iPhone models to come with a stainless steel frame next year. Foxconn is said to be the sole supplier of the high-end iPhone models next year as it will be the exclusive manufacturer of the new stainless steel frame. Glass supplier Corning and glass casing maker Lens Technology and Biel Crystal are also said to benefit from the new design. Previously Kuo predicted that Apple would introduce a new 5.8-inch model of the 2017 iPhone. Although the display will be larger, the form factor of the device is said to be smaller than the current 5.5-inch iPhone. If the supply level of the AMOLED displays is sufficient, Apple may replace the 5.5-inch model. Please follow iClarified on Twitter, Facebook, Google+, or RSS for updates.

No way glass is better than aluminum if the phone is dropped..and even the most careful user will drop the phone on the ground at some point. Reply · Like · Mark as Spam . - September 30, 2016 at 1:05pm Well the harder the material is, the more impact the fall makes. Glass continues to improve. Reply · Like · Mark as Spam Why - October 1, 2016 at 1:40pm That's true to a point . But for me I never broke any of my phones . I had the 4 back In The day and I never dropped it But if Apple dose this they better include glass protection in there apple care plan Reply · Like · Mark as Spam Zetaprime - September 29, 2016 at 4:58pm A glass casing is a terrible idea. That will just make the phone more easily broken. Aluminum please!!

The S&P healthcare index fell 0.7 percent, marking the second straight day of decline as shares of Merck and Johnson & Johnson booked losses. Apple fell 1.23 percent after Barclays cut its price target. The stock was the biggest drag on Wall Street. Investors are awaiting Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's speech in Washington for clues on the timing of the next interest rate hike. "The markets are taking a step back after a couple of pretty good days," said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. "It is the end of the quarter so there are people messing around with some positions." The three indexes have registered gains in the past two days. At 11:01 a.m. ET (1501 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 40.85 points, or 0.22 percent, at 18,298.39. The S&P 500 was down 4.78 points, or 0.22 percent, at 2,166.59. The Nasdaq Composite was down 22.79 points, or 0.43 percent, at 5,295.75. Five of the 11 major S&P indexes were lower, with utilities falling the most by 1.1 percent. The sector, which is sensitive to interest rates, is on track to mark its fifth day of losses in a row. Kansas City Fed President and voting member Esther George told CNBC that it was time to move ahead with a rate hike, a stand that Atlanta Fed president Dennis Lockhart echoed. Oil prices were up 0.4 percent, after Wednesday's 6 percent rally, as investors questioned whether an OPEC agreement to curb production would be enough to rebalance a heavily over-supplied market. ConAgra was the top percentage gainer on the S&P, rising 7.3 percent after the company's profit beat analysts' estimate. Intra-Cellular plunged 63.2 percent after the company said its schizophrenia drug did not show any clinically significant difference when compared with placebo. Ebay rose 3 percent after Deutsche Bank upgraded the e-commerce platform's rating to "buy" and raised its price target. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,667 to 1,156. On the Nasdaq, 1,625 issues fell and 995 advanced. The S&P 500 index showed 19 new 52-week highs and one new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 52 new highs and 20 new lows.

In fact, more respondents said they planned to purchase the AirPods than the new Apple Watch Series 2 (eight percent). “Twelve precent of the US installed base could lead to up to an incremental $3 billion in revenue,” the analysts wrote. About 56 percent of respondents find their current headphones good enough and forty percent of respondents won’t be buying the AirPods because they deem the product too pricey. According to analysts, “only a small portion of respondents own the Watch Series 1 and only eight percent of respondents intend to buy the Watch Series 2”. I’m finding the results of this survey eye-opening. For starters, fifty percent more respondents said they would be buying the AirPods than there were those who said the same for the Apple Watch Series 2. That’s remarkable given the Apple Watch Series 2 is on sale and available for hands-on experience in Apple Stores, but the AirPods will arrive in October and cannot be tried out yet. Will you be buying Apple’s wireless earbuds?

I’m getting a Nixon Mission. Yes I know it runs Android. Yes I know I won’t be able to do as much with it as a Apple Watch. No I don’t really care. For a watch that has a 10ATM rating I’m willing to sacrifice seamless integration. AMB_07 Will I buy Apple’s overpriced low-quality not practical and super-easy-to-lose Airpods? No, no I will not. Amid Abdul Pls tell me more why is it overpriced (name one company which has a cheaper true wireless earbuds with these specs) and why is it easy to loose. Watch some early reviews on yt, especially business insider’s. Low quality? LOL AMB_07 Struck a nerve didn’t I? haha Not that I have to justify my opinion to you but allow me to respond anyway: Yes I’ve seen reviews I don’t base my opinion out of thin air. The airpods don’t sound that much better than the included earphones and the price that is asked for this kind of sound quality is too much to me yes ( I am in Canada ). The main attraction of this thing is it being wireless, period. Better options for me do exist out there. They are easy to lose, drop one while running, go ahead. Or if you’re in the metro with dozens of people walking around you. One of those drops in those circumstances good luck finding it back. Sure they’re pretty, but they’re not for me. Amid Abdul Nah, Im totally chilled 🙂 The main attraction is that it is TRUE wireless. I prefer in-ear solutions, but I couldnt find a true wireless from other companies. What they sell is more expensive than the Airpods and their fb page is full of rage because of the unreliable connection. (for example: Bragi) Or they are just a startup, that probably never going to ship. Maybe you have a point about the sound quality, I’ll find out when I try one, Im not an audiofil though. Rowan09 Everyone is an expert now a days and need the most clear headphones on the market but pay a fraction of the price. Studio headphones cost an arm and a leg. Amid Abdul Yeah, the funny thing is everyone is talking about how bad these bt earbuds sound, but they listen to compressed music from spotify or youtube.. 🙂 AMB_07 It is ironic yes, those people wouldn’t know the difference between quality they’ll only look at the brand and the look of the headphones. AMB_07 I wouldnt call myself an audiophile either and I may have pushed it a bit hard when I said low-quality, Apple’s earphones are very “standard” if you know what I mean. By no means bad, but at those prices I can get stuff that sound clearly better (altough not a night/day difference). Anyways man, have fun with your Airpods! Amid Abdul Yeah I hope I wont have to return it because they’re falling out. Thanks btw 🙂 Jamessmooth I won’t buy the earbuds, but I will upgrade my apple watch to series 2 over the holidays! chjode Waiting for a refurb or Black Friday deal on the Apple Watch Series 2. Last year Target had the Apple Watch with $100 gift card that might be worth considering. George V This survey doesn’t make sense because currently the Apple Watch Series 2 is unavailable in the entire country until Nov. 2 philip Mills I ordered my series 2 nike sports on 9th September still not got no email yet does anybody know when it will be available thanks George V I ordered my series 2 that day and got it 2 weeks later only to find out it was defective and they had no replacements so I had to return it…. I don’t understand how they don’t anticipate demand and push production KerChin Teh Hey, if you have access to an Apple Store, you can try to to do an in store pick up. That’s how I got mine. You’d have to check the Apple Store app on your phone or online pretty much everyday to see if they have it in stock or not. Just have the item in your cart and while you’re at check out, do store pick up. It will tell you if it is in stock or not. They update their inventory status at around 8 am everyday. That’s what a specialist told me. Hope this helps! George V Thanks for the tip! I will start checking everyday I hope they get some soon Rowan09 You never make too much, you meet demand instead of predicting it. Jon20 I want them mainly for their seamless integration. Also the fact that if I needed to bring an extra battery pack for my iPhone or the AirPod case, all I need is a lightning cable and that’s it. Currently I’m using Bluetooth headsets that require Micro USB so I always have to carry a Lightning Cable and a Micro USB Cable in the event that I run out of juice. Having everything lightning would make things so much easier. I would also really like them in Black. Being that the design looks a little awkward as it is, the white just stands out too much. Black would sort of blend in a little better like traditional Bluetooth headsets. But I will do the white if I have to. Omkar Nagnur Pretty sure Dbrand or some other company will come up with skins :p TJ I will be buying the Apple Airpods, I see no use for the Apple Watch iByron AirPods cost $159. Apple Watch Series 2 starts at $369. More people are interested in buying a bag of chips than a sheet of Wagyu steaks, too. czbird Still waiting for a serious accoustic quality review of these… totempole90 Will these new Airpods work on older devices like SE and Apple TV 4? Chris Owen Well I don’t know about the TV but the iPhone SE should definitely work with them as long as it’s running iOS 10. Omkar Nagnur Check the apple website. It says all devices running iOS 10 (that includes TV 4 i guess) and os 10.12 will work! ConduciveMammal I would really love to own a pair of these. But £159 is far too expensive for something that could very easily be lost/plucked straight out of your ears. Troy I’m just not interested in the AirPods. I have powerbeats for the gym and my V-Moda Crossfade Wireless for everyday use. Firedomain Release them in black & i might consider it… mwpitt52 Buy the new Beats X. And you will not look like a dork. lou111 Airpods are great, but in natural way these should be add with iPhone 7 in price. Absolutely. If they want to make a evolution they should be consistent. Adaptor is not funny half-measure.. Wolfgang Rumpf This is fairly revealing, actually – if 8% of responders want to purchase the Watch Series 2, that actually translates into significant sales. I do not view this as a negative. Sleetui This better work for older iOS’s. And not have iOS 10 be mandatory for usage.   Search Connect with iDownloadBlog Facebook Become a fan RSS Get the latest news YouTube Watch Us Twitter Stay up to date Newsletter News delivered to you Google+ Add us to your circle   The most recent headlines How to show the storage drive icon on your Mac desktop How to mention someone in your Instagram story MacBook Pro with Touch Bar now available for in-store pickup Get up to $200 off the new MacBook Pro + no tax outside NY Where the Apple Car is going   The latest jailbreak news Jailbreak tweaks of the week: EmojiSuggest, PasswordRecovery, & more… EmojiSuggest brings iOS 10-like emoji suggestions to the predictive keyboard WiJoin lets you know what Wi-Fi network you’re connected to PasswordRecovery stores passwords and recovers them when you forget them NCTextColor lets you add vibrancy to Notification Center iDownloadBlog           iDownloadblog.com About About Advertise Contact Keep in Touch Twitter Facebook RSS Feed Newsletter Push Notifications Podcasts Let's Talk iOS Let's Talk Jailbreak Site Stuff Disclosure Privacy Policy   Copyright iDownloadBlog 2016.

Canadian-based BlackBerry announced Wednesday it would halt in-house production of smartphones, marking the end of an era for the once-dominant handset producer. Originally known as Research in Motion, the company earned a dedicated following of "CrackBerry" addicts and introduced millions to the smartphone. But, its luster faded with the introduction of the iPhone in 2007 and the large number of low-costs Android handsets that followed. BlackBerry travelled a road well-worn. Finland's Nokia, once the world's largest mobile phone maker, has seen its smartphone business go up in smoke as well. Internet pioneer Yahoo recently inked a deal to sell its core business to US telecommunications firm Verizon after years of struggling in vain to revive growth in an online search market usurped by Google. "What they have in common is that they haven't reacted well to rapid change from their original positions," said Endpoint Technologies Associates analyst Roger Kay. "Tech has high velocity." The tech sector is young and fast-moving in an internet culture that praises "disruption" and "revolution" of industries and lifestyles. Among mottos found on the walls of leading social network Facebook is "Move fast and break things." Smartphones themselves have become seemingly indispensible, with people typically replacing handsets every year or two in order to have the newest features or capabilities. - Resting on laurels - Changing to capitalize on a new trend can be daunting for companies comfortable with products that keep revenue flowing for the moment. "It reminds me of all those old singers going to Las Vegas to do whatever it is they do when they should really have just stopped," Kay said of tech companies sticking with what early hits. "Everybody wants to do an encore and get paid again." When Apple launched the iPhone in 2007, some critiques questioned why the California company was "cannibalizing" its successful line of iPods. The iPhone became a global sensation, and a main driver of stellar profit for Apple. Kay noted that when Yahoo ruled internet search it became clear their model was under attack by a newcomer called Google. Yahoo may not have seen the threat, or may have blinded itself to the need for change because its old business model continued to pump revenue, according to Kay. And while there are individual specifics underlying the downfall of incumbent mobile phone titans, they all faced the sudden and simultaneous rise of two powerhouses Apple disrupted smartphones and lifestyles with its iPhone, and Google fired back with an Android mobile operating system that any consumer electronics maker was free to use. The Google and Apple one-two punch was enough to essentially "pivot" a smartphone market that incumbents thought was too stable to rattle, according to independent Silicon Valley analyst Rob Enderle. "None of the big firms were prepared to deal with it," Enderle said of two companies new to the smartphone scene fueling a revolution. Unlike the birth of search engine Google on a young and growing internet, mobile phones were an existing market that incumbents felt they knew well and were "completely taken aback by the combination of Apple and Google," according to Enderle. - Reinvention - Veteran technology firms being overtaken by newcomers is not necessarily inevitable, if established companies have the wit and courage to re-invent themselves, adapting to survive. Analyst Kay noted IBM, a century-old technology company that has embraced transformation time and again, even shedding products along the way. Computer chip giant Intel shifted its focus to microprocessors for mobile devices to adapt to how internet-connected devices were evolving. Apple itself was a computer company on the brink of bankruptcy when it staked its future on iPods and iPhones in a winning move that made it one of the most profitable companies on the planet. The future is a question mark for Microsoft, once the world's largest company, which has fallen behind Apple and Google as the PC industry declines and which is refocusing on enterprise services. But reinvention isn't a cure-all, and needs ongoing commitment to change along with vision of where markets are heading. IBM now seems tangled in endless restructuring, with revenue declining for more than four years; Intel continues to struggle to find the kind of success it had with big computer chips. Analysts have taken to wondering whether Apple itself has become too dependent on the iPhone, and is taking too long to come up with "the next big thing."

Stick It In (or On) Your Ear Analyst Says iPhone SE Was a One-Off for Apple View All Editorials → New Retina MacBook Pro Models Expected in October Jeff Gamet @jgamet · +Jeff Gamet Sep 29th, 2016 10:47 AM EST | News That new MacBook Pro you’ve been holding out for may finally be only a few weeks away. A new report claims Apple plans to release updated models in the second half of October. Reports say new Retina MacBook Pro models coming in October The refreshed Retina MacBook Pro line is expected to replace the keyboard’s function key row with a touch sensitive OLED strip that shows app-specific controls. The new models will also likely ditch the current USB ports for USB-C with Thunderbolt 3 support, gain Touch ID support, trim a little thickness off the body, and higher end models may switch to AMD’s Polaris graphics processor. It doesn’t look like the MacBook Pro will adopt the MacBook’s wedge-shape body and will stick with the flat slab style Apple has used for years, although the overall footprint will be smaller. Sources speaking with MacRumors narrowed Apple’s launch window to the second half of October, getting the laptops out in time for the holiday buying season and fitting in with previous year’s product launches during the month. Those sources didn’t say when Apple would announce the new models, but TMO’s say we should happen on October 11th. The last update to the Retina MacBook Pro line was in May 2015. Prior to that, the last update to the came in October 2013 with the switch from Intel’s Ivy Bridge processors to Haswell, making Apple’s pro laptop ripe for a refresh. Apple could use Intel’s Kaby Lake processors in the new laptops, although that’s something of a longshot. Intel is finally delivering the new chipset to device makers now, but ramping up production for the quantities Apple needs takes time. Intel may not be able to deliver enough Kaby Lake chips until next year, and if that’s the case the new MacBook Pro will ship with Skylake processors instead. While getting a Skylake-based MacBook Pro would be a little disappointing considering the chipset is already a year old, it wouldn’t be a game stopper. The differences between Skylake and Kaby Lake are incremental, and the next major change in Intel’s chipsets isn’t coming until 2017 with Cannonlake. Regardless of which chipset Apple uses, we should see a nice performance boost compared to the Haswell chips in current MacBook Pro models. Hopefully we’ll get better battery life, too.

You mentioned the week of the 10th. 9to5 Mac is saying the 24th. I hope TMO is right. As far as USB-C, if they have TB3 support that’s fine. I can get an adapter for my old devices. However they better have a bunch of ports. I’d like to see 4. The single port on the MacBook is absurd. I hope they keep the memory card drive too. I use it a lot. The OLED Function key row: Meh. Until I see how it’s used I’m withholding judgement. Skylake is fine John M., a few weeks ago, pointed out the performance difference isn’t that great so it doesn’t bother me. What I DO want is storage. That the low end MBP has a 128GB drive is an embarrassment. Bump that up to 256, have the second tier at 512, and top end 1TB with build to order at 2TB. I don’t care if Apple wants us to store stuff on the cloud. The cloud isn’t always accessible. I need local storage. Even if backups and archives, and indeed some files are in iCloud, I have hefty video files that I need to work with locally. I want space. While you’re at it bump the base memory to 16GB. It’s a Pro machine.

Photo: AFP Published on Thursday, 29 September, 2016 at 17:08 (AFP) BlackBerry has joined Yahoo, Nokia and other technology industry stars felled by an internet age in which companies are forced to evolve quickly or perish. Canadian-based BlackBerry announced Wednesday it would halt in-house production of smartphones, marking the end of an era for the once-dominant handset producer. Originally known as Research in Motion, the company earned a dedicated following of "CrackBerry" addicts and introduced millions to the smartphone. But, its luster faded with the introduction of the iPhone in 2007 and the large number of low-costs Android handsets that followed. BlackBerry travelled a road well-worn Finland's Nokia, once the world's largest mobile phone maker, has seen its smartphone business go up in smoke as well. Internet pioneer Yahoo recently inked a deal to sell its core business to US telecommunications firm Verizon after years of struggling in vain to revive growth in an online search market usurped by Google. they haven't reacted well to rapid change from their original positions "What they have in common is that they haven't reacted well to rapid change from their original positions," said Endpoint Technologies Associates analyst Roger Kay. "Tech has high velocity." The tech sector is young and fast-moving in an internet culture that praises "disruption" and "revolution" of industries and lifestyles. Photo: AFP Among mottos found on the walls of leading social network Facebook is "Move fast and break things." Smartphones themselves have become seemingly indispensible, with people typically replacing handsets every year or two in order to have the newest features or capabilities. Changing to capitalise on a new trend can be daunting for companies comfortable with products that keep revenue flowing for the moment. "It reminds me of all those old singers going to Las Vegas to do whatever it is they do when they should really have just stopped," Kay said of tech companies sticking with what early hits. "Everybody wants to do an encore and get paid again." iPhone became a global sensation When Apple launched the iPhone in 2007, some critiques questioned why the California company was "cannibalising" its successful line of iPods. The iPhone became a global sensation, and a main driver of stellar profit for Apple. Kay noted that when Yahoo ruled internet search it became clear their model was under attack by a newcomer called Google. Yahoo may not have seen the threat, or may have blinded itself to the need for change because its old business model continued to pump revenue, according to Kay. And while there are individual specifics underlying the downfall of incumbent mobile phone titans, they all faced the sudden and simultaneous rise of two powerhouses Apple disrupted smartphones and lifestyles with its iPhone, and Google fired back with an Android mobile operating system that any consumer electronics maker was free to use. The Google and Apple one-two punch was enough to essentially "pivot" a smartphone market that incumbents thought was too stable to rattle, according to independent Silicon Valley analyst Rob Enderle. "None of the big firms were prepared to deal with it," Enderle said of two companies new to the smartphone scene fueling a revolution. Unlike the birth of search engine Google on a young and growing internet, mobile phones were an existing market that incumbents felt they knew well and were "completely taken aback b the combination of Apple and Google," according to Enderle. Veteran technology firms being overtaken by newcomers is not necessarily inevitable, if established companies have the wit and courage to re-invent themselves, adapting to survive. Analyst Kay noted IBM, a century-old technology company that has embraced transformation time and again, even shedding products along the way. Question mark hangs over future of Microsoft Computer chip giant Intel shifted its focus to microprocessors for mobile devices to adapt to how internet-connected devices were evolving. Apple itself was a computer company on the brink of bankruptcy when it staked its future on iPods and iPhones in a winning move that made it one of the most profitable companies on the planet. The future is a question mark for Microsoft, once the world's largest company, which has fallen behind Apple and Google as the PC industry declines and which is refocusing on enterprise services. But reinvention isn't a cure-all, and needs ongoing commitment to change along with vision of where markets are heading. IBM now seems tangled in endless restructuring, with revenue declining for more than four years; Intel continues to struggle to find the kind of success it had with big computer chips.

It looks like the company might be saving a log of all of your iMessages in the event the police ever need them. Apple has said that your information is safe, however, The Intercept obtained a document that implies otherwise. We’ll try to explain this as easily as possible, no technical terms. It’s a matter of blue text bubbles vs green text bubbles. The blue bubbles are on Apple’s “more secure network.” While the network may be more secure, it’s also logging each text including the date, time, and your IP address. Now, there’s good news and bad news…The good news is Apple only keeps these records for 30 days. The bad news is that with a court order these logs can be sent to the police for investigation. There are a lot more details HERE, but that’s pretty much the gist. Leigh Ann AdamfacebookFollow More from Leigh Ann Adam Comments Leave a Reply Cancel reply Enter your comment here...

But a solution has come in the form of a new case for the phone that's currently trying to raise funds on crowdfunding platform Indiegogo. The Fuze iPhone 7 case includes a 3.5mm headphone jack that means you won't have to use wireless headphones or Apple's fiddly adapter. Or drill a hole in your phone. Read More Apple October event looks more likely as internet rumours hint at new Macbook (Photo: Indiegogo) "Apple wants you to buy their new AirPod wireless earbuds. Remember how bad it was a few years back when we were first trying Bluetooth earpieces? This is twice as bad. Plus, they’re expensive, and you know that you’ll end up losing one," explains the product's campaign page. The case works by effectively building Apple's Lightning-to-3.5mm adapter into the case itself. It also works in an additional battery so it should boost your iPhone's life as well as giving you the chance to use your favourite wired headphones. Fuze builds the iPhone 7 adapter into the case (Photo: Indiegogo) The case adds 5mm of thickness to the iPhone 7 - almost doubling the initial 7.1mm size. It also adds 28g of weight to the iPhone 7's existing 138g heft.

So far it has achieved over $12,700 (£9,700) in pledges. Apple's decision to remove the headphone jack was widely rumoured before the phone's announcement in September. The decision has been met with both praise and criticism from rumours.

As competition in the music streaming industry between Spotify and Apple Music heats up, Spotify could be looking for a way to fortify its product, reports the Financial Times. The Times goes on to state that SoundCloud has been considering launching a mid-tier subscription model streaming product, making it a threat to similar streaming service from Apple, Amazon and primarily Spotify. However, when the company decided to go with a $9.99 USD option known as SoundCloud Go, it apparently lost its real chance at being competitive. After acquiring over 100 million in capital from a recent funding round and being valued at over 700 million, the amount of Spotify’s potential bid is unclear. This past month, Spotify hit 40 million subscribers whereas Apple Music has grown its service to reach over 17 million subscribers. SoundCloud, on the other hand, despite amassing over 200 million users, has never turned a profit. The platform houses over 135 million tracks, though it hasn’t reported its fiscal results since 2014. It’s reasonable to assume that the trend of generating losses has continued into the present. This isn’t the first time an acquisition has been discussed by the two streaming providers. Last spring, Spotify apparently entered talks to buy SoundCloud but retreated at the asking price. Since then, SoundCloud has completed a $100 million funding round, including investors such as Twitter, which prompted Spotify to reconsider its options. With giants like Apple, Google and Amazon preparing to compete aggressively in music, companies like SoundCloud and Spotify need to capitalize on their early lead in online music. The Times reports that while independent music companies are struggling, music streaming revenues are up by approximately 45.2 percent. While a deal between Spotify and SoundCloud could still fall through, reports indicate that the discussions are fairly advanced.

I do like it. But soundcloud with al the EDM artists I follow .. I hope Spotify dont change it too too much Omar SoundCloud earlier this year IIRC changed up some of their subscription plans for subscribers, trying to increase their profit. I’ve been using it to upload my music since 2011 and it’s improved leaps and bounds over the year. While I understand they want/need to make more money, I feel like Spotify would drastically change the platform in pursuit of that. I would happily pay a few extra dollars a month to keep SoundCloud independent, however. Tyrannosaur3464 If Spotify would’ve introduced a family account in Canada sooner, I would’ve continued to use their service. From my experience I have better luck finding the music I like on Apple Music anyways. Good luck Spotify. Natsunii7 For me soundcloud has plateaued in many ways, if Spotify can get rid of the limitations of Soundcloud and the fact the service has changed so much;preview tracks and region locks which has affected long time users to the point some track don’t appear in playlists or likes and artist paying to upload over a threshold. The site was originally lesser know artists, remixes and people trying out uploading. It has evolved into other styles like rap which take up most of the front page but now it has become a copyright artist site pushing the original intention down the pipe. Some older things need to be brought back and have spotify as the payed alternative for artist so SC can be what it was before, as now well known artist and labels take liberties with soundcloud which has caused what SC is now.

Black Friday Tech Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Holiday Gifts Cyber Monday     Can Police Read Your IMessages Without Consent? Posted: Sep 29 2016, 7:44am CDT | by Noel Diem, in News | Apple   Photo Credit: Getty Images   Apple has made a big deal about how little customer data that they actually store on their servers, that doesn't mean that the iPhone company doesn't have any information that police agencies couldn't use if they needed to - and people are starting to find out about it. Don't Miss: The Amazon Black Friday 2016 Ad The Intercept found that Apple knows which phone numbers you are even considering sending a message to, and that is because as soon as you type in another phone number, Apple's servers start looking to see whether or not the number represents another iOS device. This is what makes the messages on your iPhone turn blue (if they have iMessage and use Apple's own service) or green if it sends as a traditional text message. If you think about it, that shouldn't come as a surprise because the iPhone has to know which type of message to send. However, it is news that Apple will hold onto that information for 30 days. This can create problems, especially when people make a switch from an iPhone to another type of phone and the messages still think they should go over in iMessage format. About 3.5 years ago, Apple engineers started storing these numbers to help identify any bugs or potential problems, according to a source that is familiar with what the company is doing. So what does that mean? Apple does have a lot less information about you and your daily messages than a traditional text message would have since carriers can determine who the messages go to, what they say, and even where and when the message was sent. Apple doesn't even know that, they only know that at one point you typed a specific number into your phone. Still, they have said that they will share data it has access to with law enforcement if they are given a warrant. "Because iMessage is encrypted end-to-end, we do not have access to the contents of those communications," Apple said. "In some cases, we are able to provide data from server logs that are generated from customers accessing certain apps on their devices."

Apple and consulting firm Deloitte are teaming up to help organisations with their business transformation efforts through the use of Apple devices. The move is just the latest sign that Cupertino is feeling the need to get more serious about the business market than in the past. We wonder why... Apple’s latest foray into the corporate arena sees Deloitte creating what it claims as a first-of-its-kind Apple practice to advise customers. This will be staffed with over 5,000 strategic advisors focused on helping businesses transform the way their entire operation works. The centrepiece of this effort is a new service offering called EnterpriseNext, which focuses on the fruity device maker’s iOS ecosystem of hardware, software and services and how these can be applied in the workplace. Among the services EnterpriseNext reportedly offers is a team of iOS architects, designers and engineers able to build native apps to integrate with existing enterprise systems such as ERP, CRM, analytics and HR, and Workshops for iOS to “quickly take ideas from prototype to custom-built iOS solutions”. The move is the latest in a growing trend over the past couple of years for Apple to do deals with outfits that already have an established presence in the enterprise arena, in stark contrast to its traditional disdain for anything corporate. Cupertino’s affair with big business started with a deal with IBM to sell and support its iPhone and iPad models to Big Blue’s customer base, while IBM also developed a line of MobileFirst enterprise applications to run on them. Last year, the love-in moved to a deal with Cisco, focused around making Apple’s mobile devices play better with corporate Wi-Fi networking kit, among other things. This year, the deal was with SAP in a partnership to create native iOS apps for the enterprise firm's HANA analytics platform. This increased focus on corporate partnerships could be a symptom of Apple’s traditional consumer market becoming saturated, and the firm seeking territory where it can still grow demand for its iDevices. Some evidence for this can be drawn from Cupertino’s last earnings presentation, where both Tim Cook and chief financial officer Luca Maestri emphasised progress in the business arena. “We're making great progress with our enterprise initiatives and we see strong growth opportunities ahead of us,” Maestri said, going on to mention a deal with Russia's largest bank Sberbank that will see an additional 22,000 iPads deployed in mobility solutions across the organisation. However, this is a tougher sell than flogging updated phones and fondleslabs to Apple’s adoring fanbase of loyal consumers, as witnessed by the fact that Microsoft’s Surface Pro has so far comfortably outsold Apple’s professional-oriented iPad Pro. The Surface is an “easier sell” to businesses because of compatibility with the existing corporate infrastructure, as The Register pointed out following disclosure of the first quarter sales figures for both devices earlier this year. Hence the focus on doing deals with companies that are already well entrenched in the corporate market and trusted to advise and support enterprise customers with their IT strategy. Expect to see more deals like this in future. ® Sponsored: Magic quadrant for enterprise mobility management suites Tips and corrections 11 Comments Whitepapers Data and Analytics Maturity Model and Business Impact How top performing enterprises use their IT investments to store, process, and use data to make more effective, real-time decisions.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple Invents a Magnetic Array System Allowing an Apple Pencil to Securely Attach to an iPad + | Main | China Reports that Apple Set to Open a New R&D Center in Zhongguancun Science Park Later this Year » September 29, 2016 Apple Reveals New Advances for Future OLED Displays & Revisits Ambient Light Apple Watch Invention   In April of this year Patently Apple posted a report titled "Will Apple Extend their use of OLED Displays to Future iPads, MacBooks & Beyond?" The report covered Samsung's likely introduction of AMOLED panels for notebooks by partnering with a company called Parade. The CEO of Parade stated that "Samsung's introduction of AMOLED panels for notebooks is an important milestone in the PC industry, and we are honored to be chosen as a development partner by Samsung in this endeavor." With Apple partnering with Samsung for iPhone OLED displays, I wondered if Apple had bigger ambitions for OLED displays as in extending their use to other devices. Today a patent filing by Apple came to light at the U.S. Patent Office that clearly indicates that this is so. In addition, Patently Apple posted a report earlier this month titled "Display Experts Claim that the iPhone 7 LCD Display is the Best Ever Tested." In some benchmarks Apple was able to advance LCD's to even better OLED. As Apple is about to shift to OLED, it must be understood that Apple has filed multiple patents to advance OLED and compensate for its many short comings. Today, two more OLED centric inventions have come to light applying to future OLED displays for Apple products. And lastly, an old Apple Watch patent resurfaced regarding the use of its Photodiode sensor that rests against the user's skin.   OLED Patent #1: Organic Light-Emitting Diode Display with Smooth Dimming Control   For geeks who like to dig deeper into some of Apple's more technical patent filings, today is a treat for you. Two new OLED inventions from Apple have come to light. The first patent application is 20160284275 titled "Organic Light-Emitting Diode Display with Smooth Dimming Control."   In this invention Apple points to a problem with OLED displays when it comes to controlling the brightness of displays that use a peak luminance control algorithm that doesn't always work which produces unexpected color shifts in the display.   Apple's invention covers displays that have a brightness that is controlled using a series of cascaded digital-to-analog converter circuits. The display may be calibrated at a series of predetermined display brightness settings. For display brightness settings that fall between two consecutive display brightness settings in the series of predetermined display brightness settings, voltage interpolation operations may be performed to obtain the corresponding display brightness settings. Performing voltage interpolations instead of digital brightness setting interpolation helps minimize luminance jumps and unexpected color shifts when adjusting the brightness of the display.   Apple illustrates in patent FIGS. 1-4 noted above that all of their devices will be able to take advantage of today's advanced OLED technology: FIG. 8 is a diagram of an illustrative display controller; As shown in FIG. 8, display controller #92 may include peak luminance control and brightness control circuitry #100, gamma circuitry #102, source driver circuitry #104, and a timing controller #106.   To review the finer details behind this invention, review Apple's patent application in full here.   OLED Patent #2: Organic Light-Emitting Diode Display with Gate Pulse Modulation   Apple's second OLED centric invention is titled "Organic Light-Emitting Diode Display with Gate Pulse Modulation" found under patent application 20160284276.   Apple notes in this patent filing that "It can be challenging to accurately control the performance of organic light-emitting diode pixels. Drive transistor threshold voltage compensation schemes compensate for threshold variations in the drive transistors, but do not compensate for variations in switching transistors. Dynamic effects for a switching transistor such as clock feedthrough and charge injection can reduce the voltage at the gate of a drive transistor that is coupled to the switching transistor during switching. As a result, pixel brightness range may be reduced and the drive transistor current may be sensitive to variations in switching transistor device parameters. Apple's invention is to fix this problem for future OLED displays that they intend to use.   Apple's patent Abstract states: "Display driver circuitry may load data into an array of pixels via data lines. The display driver circuitry may supply control signals including scan signals to the pixels via control lines. Each pixel may have transistors and capacitor circuitry for controlling the emission of light from a light-emitting diode. A drive transistor may be coupled in series with the light-emitting diode to control the amount of current flowing through the light-emitting diode. The drive transistor may have a drive transistor gate terminal that is coupled to one of the source-drain terminals of a switching transistor. The switching transistor may have a switching transistor gate terminal that receives the scan signal. When transitioning prior to an emission phase of operation, the scan signal may have a two-step transition profile or other shape that enhances display performance by reducing dynamic effects in the switching transistor."   To review the finer details behind this invention, review Apple's patent application in full here.   Original Apple Watch Patent Resurfaces   Another OLED related patent has surfaced today titled "Ambient Light Sensing through the Human Body." It happens to be one of the original Apple Watch patents.   It may appear to be new because it doesn't refer to itself as being a continuation patent. However, anytime you see patent claims "cancelled" it's because it's a continuation patent. In this patent filing, claims 2, 3, 10, 11, 12, 16, 19, 21, 22, 25, 26, 27, 28 and 29 were cancelled from the original filing of November 2013. This is not a new invention.   Apple's patent FIG 3A noted above illustrates a cross-sectional view of an exemplary portable electronic device with optical sensors located outside of the device body on the underside of the device.   More specifically, Apple notes that the optical sensor can sense visible light, infrared light, ultraviolet light, and/or other spectra of light, or can be any combination or portion of the above spectra. The optical sensor may be any type of sensor or sensors, including, but not limited to, a photoresistor, optical detector, chemical detector, photovoltaic cell, photodiode, phototransistor, charge-coupled device, and so on.   As noted in Apple's original Apple Watch graphic noted below, they decided to go with a "photodiode" optical sensor as referenced to in the patent above from Apple's patent point #0034.   So this isn't a new invention as others are claiming today or something that coming in the future. No, it's simply reviewing what was introduced with the original Apple Watch.    To review the finer details behind one of Apple's original Apple Watch Inventions, see patent application 20160284316 here.   Patently Apple presents a detailed summary of patent applications with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each such patent application is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trade Office. Readers are cautioned that the full text of any patent application should be read in its entirety for full and accurate details.

ITProPortal Search RSS News Features Analysis Guides Reviews Categories Business Hardware Security Software Mobile Enterprise Cloud Networks Public Sector Startups Web Spotify may acquire SoundCloud to compete against Apple Music By Anthony Spadafora Spotify is rumoured to be in talks to acquire the streaming music service SoundCloud in order to better compete against Apple Music, Tidal and Amazon Prime. Shares In an effort to better compete against Apple Music and other music streaming services, Spotify may be considering purchasing SoundCloud. Apparently the two companies are in “advanced talks” that could result in Spotify acquiring its rival that has been valued at $700 million. Recently Spotify has faced a great deal of competition from other subscription-based music streaming services including Apple Music, Tidal, Amazon Prime and Deezer. In September, the company reached 40 million paid subscribers who pay $10 a month for premium Spotify service. This upgraded version of the site allows users to play music offline and removes all advertisements from between songs. Apple Music, which launched in June 2015, currently has 17 million paid subscribers which is less than half of Spotify's current Premium users. In order to take on its rivals, Spotify raised $1 billion earlier this year from the private equity firms TPG and Goldman Sachs. These funds will be used to add to the company's resources without it receiving a lower valuation. Spotify is valued at around $8.5 billion, though just like SoundCloud, it has been unable to earn a profit yet. The company however, is attempting to acquire companies and add to its subscriber base before going public next year. SoundCloud, which was founded in 2007, has been able to raise $193.32 million from its funders in previous instalments. Unlike Spotify, it has allowed any artist to upload their music or audio to its platform which is made up of 125 million tracks from 12 million “creators.”  The company has also been working on building up its own subscription service and it launched its own $9.99 streaming service Go in March. Neither Spotify nor SoundCloud has commented on a potential buyout at this time.  Image Credit: Dennizn / Shutterstock ABOUT THE AUTHOR Anthony Spadafora Anthony currently resides in South Korea where he teaches and experiences Korean technological advances first hand.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    The U.S. Supreme Court opens its new term next week in a holding pattern while waiting for a ninth justice. After the next president takes office in January, it may be on the cusp of a historic transformation. A victory in November for Democrat Hillary Clinton would give the court a majority of Democratic appointees for the first time since 1969, at the end of the liberal era under Chief Justice Earl Warren. A 5-4 Democratic court would be more receptive to class-action lawsuits, campaign-finance rules, gun control and pollution regulations. A win for Republican Donald Trump, by contrast, could leave the court leaning right on most of those issues. He has pledged to select from a list of 21 generally conservative potential nominees. The next justice is "effectively going to decide the direction of the court," said Kannon Shanmugam, a lawyer at Williams & Connolly LLP who appears frequently before the high court. The vacancy -- created by Justice Antonin Scalia’s Feb. 13 death and prolonged by Senate Republicans’ refusal to consider President Barack Obama’s nomination of federal appellate judge Merrick Garland -- will hang over the justices in all sorts of ways when they take the bench on the traditional first Monday in October. The next justice’s space at the end of the nine-member bench will remain empty. Arguments will be quieter occasions without the pugnacious Scalia. And the pared-down docket will reflect the reality that, as currently constituted, the justices can’t resolve some of the nation’s most divisive legal issues. Insider Trading The nine-month calendar includes important cases in October on insider trading and patent disputes. The former will set the bar for prosecutions stemming from information passed by a corporate insider to a friend, relative or business associate. The question is whether prosecutors must show that the insider received a concrete benefit in exchange. The patent case marks probably the final chapter in the legal war between Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. over smartphones. Samsung is seeking to reduce a $399 million award to Apple for infringement of its patented iPhone designs. Missing, at least for now, are the types of class-action and arbitration cases that helped define the court as a business-friendly forum in recent years. Business advocates won a string of decisions, many them 5-4 with Scalia in the majority, that let companies channel consumer disputes into arbitration instead of court and limited the ability of people to press claims as a group. Those issues may be back soon. By the end of the year, the court is likely to accept a case that will determine whether employers can use arbitration agreements to force workers to press legal claims individually, and not as a class action. Liberal Majority Arguments in that case could take place in March or April -- potentially after a ninth justice is confirmed. Should Clinton win the presidential election, Garland or another nominee could give the court’s liberal wing a majority to begin opening companies to more class-action lawsuits. "When you think about what’s going to happen with the ninth justice, I think actually class actions is one of the most important areas where we’ll see change," said Neal Katyal, an appellate lawyer at Hogan Lovells and formerly the Obama administration’s top Supreme Court advocate. Katyal blames the vacancy -- and the prospect of a 4-4 deadlock -- for the court’s rejection in June of a class-action appeal he filed on behalf of Google Inc. "I think it was denied because the court really is not sure which direction to go," he said. The prospect of an even divide might also explain the court’s handling of a church-state case on its docket. The issue is whether Missouri violated the Constitution by excluding a church preschool from state funding for new playground surfaces. Slow-Walking The court agreed to hear the church’s appeal in January, before Scalia’s death, but didn’t include the dispute on its argument calendars for October and November, and instead scheduled several newer cases. The unusual delay sparked speculation that Chief Justice John Roberts might be trying to slow-walk the case with an eye toward having a full bench. "It does sort of seem like the court is waiting to schedule this case until, or if, they have nine justices," said Paul Clement, former U.S. solicitor general for President George W. Bush, who is joining the law firm of Kirkland & Ellis LLP. The next justice also might break last term’s deadlock over Obama’s effort to defer deportation for as many as 4 million unauthorized immigrants. The divide left intact a ruling blocking the plan, and the administration is asking the court to take the unusual step of reconsidering once a ninth justice is seated. Even if the high court rebuffs that request, the issue could return after additional lower court proceedings. To a large degree, the Supreme Court’s agenda will hinge on the results of the presidential election. A victory by Trump would give him not only the right to fill the Scalia vacancy, but also the power to rescind the deportation program and other disputed Obama initiatives. Transgender Rights A fight over transgender rights is one that could be derailed. A Virginia school board is appealing a ruling that would let a transgender student use the boys’ bathroom although he was born with female sexual organs. In backing the boy, a federal appeals court deferred to the Obama administration’s interpretation of federal anti-discrimination regulations -- an approach Trump would have the power to change. Election-related uncertainty is one reason Steven Shapiro, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, is optimistic the Supreme Court won’t get involved in the transgender case. "There are a lot of reasons for the court to sort of step back," said Shapiro, whose organization represents the student. The next president may have several chances to fill a vacancy on the court. Three of the remaining eight justices are 78 or older. A liberal shift may take time, though. Changes will happen slowly, even for the 2010 Citizens United campaign-finance decision, which has been a target for Democratic ire, says Paul Smith, a Supreme Court and appellate lawyer at Jenner & Block LLP. "The court doesn’t like to come in and overrule lots of cases very quickly just because there’s been a change of personnel caused by an election," Smith said. "The difference will take place over a decade or more, not in just a couple of years."   © Copyright 2016 Bloomberg News. All rights reserved.

The case also comes packed with a battery pack to enhance the iPhone 7 battery backup. by: Mahit Huilgol   Updated on September 29th, 2016   iPhone News   Fuze case brings back the 3.5mm audio jack for both iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus. The case also comes packed with a battery pack to enhance the iPhone 7 battery backup.   Recomended Apple’s $49 Solution for Listening to Music While Charging the iPhone 7   Apple iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are Water Resistant and Ditch the 3.5 mm Audio Jack   iPhone 7 and 7 Plus Launching in India on Oct 7th starting at Rs 60,000   Apple ditching the 3.5mm Audio jack in iPhone 7 divided the entire world into two bastions, one the fanboys who welcomed the move and made themselves comfy about the idea and other, the haters who were waiting for their pound of flesh by ridiculing Apple. Well, what happened here is that it left the third set of people who were looking forward to buying an iPhone but the very idea of a missing 3.5mm jack made them unsure of the device. We had earlier explained how the Apple Dock could solve your problem, but again one cannot carry it everywhere they go. Ladies and Gentlemen, what we have here is Fuze, an iPhone 7 case that promises to bring back the 3.5mm headphone jack and in the meanwhile also bump up your phone’s backup. Yes, the Fuze is the first iPhone case that not only packs a battery, but also a 3.5mm jack. Essentially, this is what the Fuze does, it connects the lightning to a 3.5mm adapter and the circuit for this has been built in the case, so no more dangling adapters. Also, the Fuze case adds up a generous 2,400mAh of battery life for the iPhone 7 while the Fuze case for iPhone 7 Plus adds a humongous 3,600mAh of power. The case is built out of TPU and ABS, a choice of material that Apple themselves use in the Lightning battery case. This is what the makers of Fuze had to say about their product, “Fuze restores 3.5mm audio jack for iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. It delivers a doubled battery life as well as scratch and shock protection, all while maintaining the iPhone’s compact profile. We need your help to bring back the jack. When you purchase Fuze, you purchase the freedom of choice.” The case is however still at concept phase and one can crowdfund it on Indiegogo. One can back the project starting from $49 for Super early birds and $59 for early birds. However, the case is expected to retail for $69 and hopefully, the company will start shipping by December. The downside though is that the case will render iPhone 7’s water resistance ability redundant as Fuze uses the lightning connector and is not water resistant in itself. It is also not clear if the phone will charge simultaneously while one listens to music. Well, now we might have some folks saying that we should move on and not resist the change but for the others who have already spent money on high-end headphones with 3.5mm jack the Fuze case might be the savior.

That’s not how Apple is positioning it, of course. The official announcement says they’ve teamed up to ‘accelerate business transformation on iPhone and iPad’. As ever Apple doesn’t use the definite article or plural when describing its products, with the apparent aim of inferring they are people or natural phenomena rather than the pieces of equipment the rest of us know them to be. This can all be categorised under the trending buzzword that is ‘digital transformation’, which many people have tried to define but few have succeeded. It seems to concern the movement of business processes into a more digital environment that has been underway for decades, but for some reason it’s finding its way into an increasing proportion of corporate thinking right now. Deloitte seems to have got into bed with Apple big-time with this collaboration, including selling the souls of 5,000 advisors into a new Apple practice that will help businesses become more digital, primarily by staring at an i-screen for most of the day. The quid pro quo seems to be Apple helping Deloitte Consulting develop EnterpriseNext, a new service that is, you guessed it, ‘…designed to help clients fully take advantage of the iOS ecosystem of hardware, software and services in the workplace.’ “We know that iOS is the best mobile platform for business because we’ve experienced the benefit ourselves with over 100,000 iOS devices in use by Deloitte’s workforce, running 75 custom apps,” fawned Punit Renjen, CEO of Deloitte Global. “Our dedicated Apple practice will give global businesses the expertise and resources they need to empower their mobile workforce to take advantage of the powerful ecosystem iOS, iPhone and iPad offer, and help them achieve their ambitions, while driving efficiency and productivity.” “As the leader in digital transformation strategy, Deloitte is an ideal partner that brings a team of Apple-dedicated strategic advisors to help clients truly revolutionise how they work using iOS, iPhone and iPad,” lorded Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “iPhone and iPad are transforming how people everywhere get work done. And through this partnership, we’re able to help even more businesses tap into the incredible capabilities that only the Apple ecosystem can deliver.” It’s hard to view this development as anything other another win for Team Apple. There will presumably be a nice lot of business for Deloitte from this Faustian Pact, but does it really want to be pigeon-holed as the company that gives good iPad?

Daniel B. Kline (TMFDankline) Sep 29, 2016 at 10:09AM One year ago, when Keurig first released its single-serve brewing system for cold beverages, it seemed like a brilliant idea. At the time, the company was riding high in the single-serve coffee space, a market it more or less created in the Unites States, with K-cup machines. Those coffeemakers went from novelties to ubiquitous in just a few years with nearly every major coffee brand signing on as a partner. Building on that success with a cold-beverage brewer designed to compete with SodaStream seemed logical, and it looked even more destined for success when Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) signed on as a partner, taking an equity stake in the company. For the first time, consumers would be able to make Coke, Diet Coke, Sprite, and the rest of the company's product line at home. That, plus the success Keurig had with its K-Cup machine, made what would become the Keurig KOLD seem destined for success. Keurig KOLD. Image source: Keurig. Of course, while it seemed like a good idea, there were also some red flags around KOLD. Keurig had struggled with its attempts to launch non-K-cup brewers, failing with its Vue cappuccino machines, and struggling to get consumers to buy brewers that made full carafes of coffee. By after KOLD hit the market, consumers quickly became less excited and it was no longer a sure thing. It may have been the brewer's $300 price tag, with beverage pods costing around $1 each, but KOLD became an almost-instant failure. Of course, Keurig did not admit that right away, but when the company was purchased by JAB Holdings and taken private, it was only a few months before the new owner killed the KOLD (offering full refunds to anyone who bought it), ending the company's cold-drink, single-serve experiment. Keurig KOLD is not alone in being a product that arrived with heavy hype only to fail miserably. Call it Snakes on a Plane syndrome, but heavy media and public interest in a product do not mean people will actually buy it. And sometimes, companies can manufacture or buy hype when no real interest exists, leading to products that everyone knows about but nobody actually wants. In many cases, these products changed the direction of the companies releasing them, making a big impact, just not in the way the company intended. Keurig dropped its KOLD system when a heavily hyped launch was not followed by sales success. Image source: author. Apple had a tablet before the iPad Sometimes, it takes a big failure to lead to the path to great success. The Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Newton was released in 1993, 14 years before the iPhone and 17 years ahead of its successor, the iPad.  A big, clunky tablet that felt like the tablet version of a 1980s cellphone, Newton was marketed partly based on handwriting recognition. And while its technology was impressive for the time, it still did a fairly lousy job of recognizing what people were writing on it using its stylus tool. That may explain why Apple waited until 2015 before it attempted a similar product, the Apple Pencil, which is sold with the iPad Pro. Newton hit the market at about $700 -- a very high price for a device that really did not do that much. It was breakthrough technology that simply was not useful enough to be worth the money. Apple scuttled the line just a few years after its launch and the product was part of the reason former CEO John Sculley was ushered out and company founder Steve Jobs was welcomed back. Nobody wants an Amazon phone Unlike some of the products on this list, Amazon.com's (NASDAQ:AMZN) phone was met with market skepticism from the time it first became rumored. But even though it was breaking into the smartphone business with a new operating system (in this case, a customized version of Android), the online retailer received some benefit of the doubt because of its success in entering the tablet market. The problem is that the company did not follow the same formula it did when it released its Kindle tablets. Those devices were introduced as a pretty good alternative to the iPad, sold at a much cheaper price. Introduced at $99 versus the roughly $499 low-end iPad cost, Kindle Fire tablets built audience by being cheaper and integrating with its own sales infrastructure -- a valuable thing on a device a lot of people would use to read and watch video content. With Fire Phone, however, Amazon deviated from the formula. Instead of making the device widely available, it was sold only through AT&T. That strategy worked for Apple in the early days of the iPhone, but at that time, the company essentially had the smartphone market to itself. That was only one of the nails in the Fire Phone's coffin, though, and perhaps not the biggest one. Amazon's device may have been more hurt by two things: (1) the fact that its wow feature -- the ability to show products for sale in 3D -- was met with ambivalence and (2) price. Instead of going low and appealing to its massive user base, the company charged iPhone-like prices for the Fire Phone, introducing it at $650 retail or $199 with a two-year contract. Those prices were lowered not long after release, but by then, it was already too late. Amazon killed off Fire Phone about a year after its launch and has made no moves to reenter the smartphone market. You can't beat the real thing The biggest sign that Coca-Cola's effort to replace its classic formulation with "New Coke" was a major flop was that people believed the company intentionally created the controversy in order to reignite interest in its flagship cola. That, however, was not the case and the company insists in its official history of the debacle that it had intended for people to like the beverage's new recipe. On April 23, 1985, Coke replaced its long-standing formula with a new one, which people dubbed "New Coke." To say consumers were less than pleased might be putting it mildly. "We set out to change the dynamics of sugar colas in the United States, and we did exactly that -- albeit not in the way we had planned," then-Chairman and CEO Roberto Goizueta said in 1995 at an employee event honoring the 10-year anniversary of "New Coke." What happened was that the clamor for the return of the original formula was deafening. The company had awakened interest in its product, but not the one it was actually selling. Because of the outcry, Coca-Cola brought its classic formula under the "Classic Coke" moniker, admitting defeat for the new version of the cola even though it was still sold, eventually rechristened Coke II before being taken off U.S. shelves.

Getting Inside the Apple Inc. iPad Apple's current relationship with Imagination Technologies won't easily be broken. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Sep 29, 2016 at 10:30AM Image source: NVIDIA.  In a recent column published by Seeking Alpha, contributor Mark Hibben offered up his commentary on the news (first published here) that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) may opt to use graphics processors from graphics specialist NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) in future Mac products. As part of this commentary, he made the following observation: Since Nvidia already features its Pascal [graphics processing unit] in its ARM-based Parker Tegra processor, I can see Apple turning to Nvidia for GPU licensing in future A series SOCs. An Apple iPad with Nvidia graphics would offer unrivaled graphics. Although this possibility seems interesting, I don't think we'll see it happen anytime soon (if ever). NVIDIA's GPUs are powerful, but Apple has been doing a fine job The graphics processors that Apple includes in its iPad-specific processors, which are implementations of technologies developed by Imagination Technologies (NASDAQOTH:IGNMF), tend to be best in class. According to tests performed by AnandTech, the A9X inside of the 12.9-inch iPad Pro far and away outperforms any other mobile processor in many graphics tests (including 3DMark Sling Shot, GFXBench 3.0, and Basemark ES 3.1). That includes the graphics processor inside of NVIDIA's own Tegra X1 system-on-a-chip (though to be fair, the X1 came out first and is built on an older manufacturing technology, putting it at a disadvantage to the A9X). In August, NVIDIA gave out the first details of its next generation Tegra processor, code-named Parker. This is a part manufactured in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's (NYSE:TSM) 16-nanometer technology (putting it on manufacturing process parity with the A9X) and could very well take the mobile graphics performance crown from Apple. However, it's important to note that the A9X is nearly a year old at this point and is likely to be replaced by the A10X in early 2017. With the A10X I would not be surprised to see Apple take the mobile graphics processor performance crown back from NVIDIA (especially since the A10X is likely to be manufactured in TSMC's newer 10-nanometer technology). The point of this discussion isn't to disparage NVIDIA's Tegra efforts. Rather, the purpose is to show that -- at least when it comes to graphics processors integrated into tablet-class processors -- Apple is already fielding leadership products. Based on this, it's really tough to make a compelling case for Apple to ditch Imagination's offerings for NVIDIA's. What could compel Apple to switch? Nothing is impossible, and I can imagine a scenario under which Apple does switch from Imagination's graphics processors to NVIDIA's. It would essentially come down to NVIDIA putting together significantly more powerful and power efficient solutions than what Imagination would be able to provide. That said, a single generation of leadership isn't likely to be enough to seal the deal. I believe that Apple would have to look at both companies' long-term graphics processor road maps and come to the conclusion that NVIDIA is not only going to take the efficiency lead in one generation, but sustain (or, preferably, grow) that lead out in time. NVIDIA's graphics processors have gotten much more efficient over the years (in the world of graphics processors targeted at personal computers, NVIDIA is generally believed to have the most power efficient solutions available), but Imagination isn't sitting still. Further, I would imagine that Apple has significant influence on Imagination's technology road map. Not only is Apple a key customer of Imagination's graphics technologies, but Apple actually owns a significant portion of Imagination. I'm not saying it's impossible for NVIDIA or another graphics processor vendor (such as ARM Holdings) to displace Imagination, but it'd be exceedingly difficult to do so. As such, I don't recommend current or potential NVIDIA shareholders to invest in the company's stock on the basis of a potential deal to supply intellectual property to Apple for its iDevices.

A report in The Intercept goes into the technical details of what happens every time a user types a number into an iPhone for a text conversation. According to the publication, the Messages app "contacts Apple servers to determine whether to route a given message over the ubiquitous SMS system or over Apple's proprietary and more secure messaging network". This determination results in the green-coloured conversations for SMS and blue-coloured for iMessage chats, which should be familiar to every iPhone user by now. The accusation made by the publication is that Apple logs and stores each of these queries for X days, with the date & time stamp as well as the IP address, which the publication claims can be used to identify a user's location. The Intercept acquired this document as part of a large chunk of documents from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement's Electronic Surveillance Support Team. Although the contents of iMessages sent over Apple's servers are encrypted end-to-end, thereby making them unreadable even to Apple, the metadata mentioned above could be used to connect dots during a criminal investigation.Apple is known for its strong stance towards customer privacy in recent times, including denying the FBI's request to unlock an iPhone of one of the two accused in the San Bernardino shootings in the US. So does the report suggest that Apple is not playing by the high standards it has set for itself? 9to5Mac.com's Jordan Kahn points out that Apple has openly admitted in the past to the alleged accusations. It is mentioned several times in Apple's legal page on their website, that Apple does log this information. The company says, "When you use your device, your phone number and certain unique identifiers for your iOS Device are sent to Apple in order to allow others to reach you by your phone number when using various communication features of the iOS Software, such as iMessage and FaceTime." Furthermore, "Apple has FaceTime call invitation logs when a FaceTime call invitation is initiated. These logs do not indicate that any communication between users actually took place." The same page also suggests that if a device is running iOS 8 or above, Apple will not be able to extract any information, as the data is protected by an encryption key tied to the product's passcode. At this point, only 3 percent of devices run a version older than iOS 8, according to Apple's Developer page. Apple admits it will be able to extract data on products running versions prior to iOS 8, including SMS, iMessage, MMS, photos, videos, contacts, audio recording, and call history. Apple also suggest that upon a search warrant, it may be able to provide iCloud content including photos, documents, contacts, calendars, bookmarks and iOS device backups which contain iMessage, SMS, and MMS messages and voicemail to the authorities. Lastly, The Intercept's claim of Apple storing a user's location was debunked by 9to5Mac, suggesting that IP addresses don't "offer exact location or even always accurate location data that could allow law enforcement or anyone else to pinpoint your location."

Bruce Springsteen: 'I Was Oblivious To Father's Health Issues Growing Up' By WENN in Music / Festivals on 29 September 2016 Facebook Twitter Google+ Pinterest StumbleUpon Reddit Fark Email Comment Follow Bruce Springsteen Bruce Springsteen Kanye West Kendrick Lamar Green Day Bruce Springsteen wasn't aware of his family's history of mental illness as a child. The rocker took part in a moderated conversation Wednesday night (28Sep16) at an Apple store in New York City to promote his new memoir, Born to Run, which was released on Tuesday (27Sep16). The Born in the USA singer's memoir reveals intimate details of his relationship with his late father Doug - a blue-collar worker who struggled with drinking and mental illness, and later in life acknowledged his failings to his son. In the book, Springsteen describes his childhood fear of his father as they struggled in a cash-strapped household in New Jersey and how completely unaware he was of his father's health issues. "As a child, it didn't register," he told moderator, Apple executive Eddy Cue, in the singer's first-ever Facebook Live event. "When I was a kid, it was a deep mystery. I think my music is the first thing that centered me. It was medicinal... It rooted you." The rocker also revealed his own battle with depression in the memoir, in which he pondered if he will get so sick he'll end up like his dad. Springsteen sat down at the Apple store for a 45-minute-long conversation in which he explained his reasons for writing the memoir. "I wanted to let people know what were the influences on my music," he shared. "I wrote songs to figure out who I was," before joking he wanted to put pen to paper before his memory failed him. "I am at that age where you are forgetting things already," he laughed. The rocker was supported at the event by old pal, Beats Electronics co-founder Jimmy Iovine, who worked as recording engineer on Springsteen's classics Born to Run, Darkness on the Edge of Town and The River before co-founding Interscope Records in 1989. The 67-year-old singer is considered rock and roll royalty, but he admitted he does enjoy listening to musicians from other genres. Springsteen singled out critically acclaimed rapper Kendrick Lamar, whom he described as "intense", and Kanye West. He said, "He makes great records. They are creative, amazing records."

Recurring Asian Company Problem I first ran into this when I was studying Sony’s battle with PCs against Dell.  Sony had by far the better looking, higher quality, and more technologically rich solutions.  Dell’s PCs, and this was in the 1990s, by comparison weren’t very attractive, had a tendency to break, and weren’t as advanced.  What made the difference was that Sony’s customer support sucked while Dell’s was world class.  While Sony invested in building a better box, Dell invested in building a better relationship with its customers.  The end result was that Dell touched their customers more often, treated them well, and the customers came back and bought again from Dell.  Sony touched its customers less often, the experience was horrid, and customers tended to then avoid the brand like the plague, and not just for PCs; they started avoiding the brand for pretty much everything from TVs to Stereos.   Apple vs. Samsung Thanks to the Apple stores and more control over its platform, Apple has had a stronger relationship with its customers than Dell has over time.  Given Windows was the industry standard, this allowed them to tread water until they could find a market they could redefine and dominate.  They found that market first with the iPod, then, using that dominance, they moved to dominate smartphones and tablets.  Their Achilles’ heel is their need for large margins and Samsung moved to aggressively take advantage of that with very high quality, lower cost phones like the Galaxy Note.   Apple out spent Samsung in marketing in the early years and thus was able to hold Samsung off from taking over market leadership until Samsung doubled down on marketing and went after Apple’s image of technical leadership.   As a result, for once, Apple looked weak. But Samsung couldn’t sustain massive advertising budgets on a slimmer margin and Apple was able to take back much of what Samsung gained until the firms reached somewhat of a steady state.   Now smartphones are relatively solid state so vendor caused breakage is rare. Yet, when it happens, Apple tends to move aggressively first to fix the perception of the problem and then to eliminate the problem itself.  While this has been somewhat uneven depending on the issue, in general, and largely thanks to some flexibility with the store managers, Apple customers have remained loyal.   But the battery fire issue with Samsung was handled so badly that the phone was largely banned on planes and there was a full recall forced by the U.S. Government.  Samsung’s attempt to minimize costs backfired and people who bought the Galaxy Note 7 were left with a phone that could burn, maim, or even kill them, not to mention the remote possibility that one of these phones could cause a car accident or down a commercial or private plane. Like Sony vs. Dell, Samsung now has a massive brand problem because buyers will likely not trust the brand—not just for phones, but for a broad range of products.  Samsung’s appliances already had a really bad reputation for poor support, and this one event could not only shift business back to Apple for phones but to companies like GE and LG for appliances.   Much like Sony dropped into decline due to a mix of brand damage and some really bad decisions with regard to digital rights management and their screwing up of the PlayStation, Samsung in one fell swoop may have taken themselves out at the knees.   Wrapping Up:  Vendor Loyalty We all have choices to make when it comes to picking a vendor, and most of us choose vendors who we believe have our backs.  While Apple has weakened from the Jobs’ years in this regard, they still lead their segment with respect to customer care.  They just do a better job of it.  Samsung has proven that they don’t have their customers’ best interests at heart even when it relates to physical safety and, I expect, that means a whole lot of you will likely be avoiding Samsung for a few years.   Generally, it takes about five years for a company to recover from a mistake like this, and that is with heavy investment in image recovery –something Samsung apparently hasn’t even started yet.   We may be witnessing the beginning of the end for what was once the most powerful South Korean brand.  I expect we are also witnessing why Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO, seems to be smiling a lot more at the moment.   Edited by Alicia Young Author Info Rob Enderle President and Principal Analyst, Enderle Group Click here to read full bio SHARE THIS ARTICLE Tweet Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. blog comments powered by Disqus Related Articles Virtual vs. Real: Both Count When Selling By: Doug Mohney    11/16/2016 People have been predicting the end of "real" interaction to buy things for decades.

(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan) Share Written by Mike Murphy September 29, 2016 For anyone who has been holding their breath waiting for Apple to finally update its laptops, it seems that you’ll soon get your wish. A new report from MacRumors suggests that Apple is getting ready to host an event at the end of October to show off its updated MacBook Pro line of computers, possibly on Oct. 24. Some Apple computers haven’t been updated in nearly three years, and the company’s current flagship laptops have been left untouched since May 2015. Apple released an upgraded version of its MacBook line earlier this year, but super-thin computers aren’t particularly powerful—last year’s smartphones, the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, are about as fast as these Macs, so many have been holding out for a laptop with a little more under the hood. Details about the revamped MacBook Pro have been sketchy, but according to 9to5Mac, it seems that the laptops will have a new small touchscreen strip about the keyboard that will replace the physical function buttons. They will also have four USB-C ports, and a power button with TouchID—the fingerprint-scanning technology used in iPhones and iPads—built-in. It’s also likely that the new laptops will come in the same range of finishes as the current MacBook line—gold, grey, rose gold, and silver—but hopefully Apple doesn’t release options to match the newest iPhone colors, as a jet black MacBook would get scratched into oblivion in no time. Reports also suggest that, unlike the new iPhone, the new MacBook Pros will likely still have a headphone jack, thankfully. There’s no word yet whether Apple also plans to update its MacBook Air line of computers, or whether the MacBook is meant to replace it. It’s also unclear when Apple will update its desktop computers: The Mac Pro is a dinosaur in consumer tech years at this point, and the Mac Mini is also an antique. Apple wasn’t immediately available to comment on its plans. Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

Apple CEO Tim Cook and Deloitte Global CEO Punit Renjen meet at Apple’s campus to announce a joint effort to accelerate business transformation using iOS, iPhone & iPad. (Courtesy of Apple/Roy Zipstein) Credit: Apple Press Image More like this Psst! Apple’s enterprise iPad plans are coming together Apple products ‘essential to the modern workforce’ - Deloitte Interview: Cisco says Apple ‘world’s most innovative’ mobile tech Video Mingis on Tech: The iPhone 7, Apple Watch 2 -- and the gadget guy! Apple and giant enterprise brand, Deloitte reached an enterprise partnership deal yesterday, another in a series of significant moves that reflect the strong leadership position of iOS in enterprise IT. I hope to have much more on this later, but thought I’d share a few insights into Apple’s enterprise success. Partnership As I’ve noted before, Apple under Tim Cook is dramatically extending its reach. When it comes to the enterprise, the company already has strong and fruitful alliances with IBM, Cisco, SAP, JAMF, and others. These are important partnerships with firms who have already built trust in enterprise IT. Delight Enterprises choosing to use iOS are happy with the results, at least, according to Punit Renjen, CEO of Deloitte Global: “We know that iOS is the best mobile platform for business because we’ve experienced the benefit ourselves, with over 100,000 iOS devices in use by Deloitte’s workforce, running 75 custom apps,” he said. You can see that as a successful real world iOS market test right there. The ecosystem, stupid Apple’s iOS isn’t just the OS, it’s also the most compatible and secure mobile OS. The data travels happily between Mac, PC and iOS device and Apple’s clear commitment to annual upgrades and lack of fragmentation – plus its ability to respond fast in the event of a security threat –make the ecosystem attractive. Developers Provision of strong developer tools and a large and enthusiastic developer community also help. It enables enrterprise to build connected tools for use internally and externally, and opens all kinds of opportnities for new innovations across a score of industries. Just wait to find out how retailers will use indoor mapping solutions and Siri.  In future Swift will contribute energy within this space, cutting the cost of deployments dramatically. Integration At the highest levels C-class execs in enterprise IT recognize that non-fragmented Apple systems work quite well with Windows. They also know that good security policy today encourages IT to shift to multi-platform, heterogeneous networks in the current upgrade cycle. Apple’s products just need to be compatible client devices to Microsoft’s ever more virtual enterprise offering, Azure cloud, servers and virtualization. In the Deloitte deal iOS architects, designers and engineers will be on hand to help build iOS solutions that “integrate seamlessly” with existing systems. Apple already supports highly effective tools for MDM within mixed platforms networks, and has long offered Exchange support. Millennials The next generation of employees is independent, tech-savvy and want to work with the devices and platforms they are used to. They will work long hours in exchange for autonomy, won’t stay in a job they despise and will vote with their feet if they don’t get what they want. These new enterprise employees already choose Apple kit, and given the cost of staff recruitment, training and retention, it behooves enterprise IT to give these valuable people what they want. “The real opportunity for us is expanding how mobile devices are used,” said Apple CEO, Tim Cook. “Many people were living a digital life at home and an analogue life at work.” BYOD BYOD was clear evidence of changing shifts in consumer preferences. Since the launch of the iMac in 1998, Apple’s focus on consumer markets helped it build mindshare that helped create huge success for the iPod and iPhone. These changing consumer preferences led to more demand to use these tools in the workplace, after all – why would you want to use worse tech in the office than you do at home? Ipsos MORI claimed over 91 per cent of US office workers use their personal devices to access, store, share and work on enterprise documents. “When given a mobile device choice, nearly 80 percent of all age groups select iOS compared to just 18 percent who choose Android,” a recent survey claimed. Security first This brings us to security. Now we know that when it comes to mobile exploits around 4 percent of attacks target iOS in contrast to 74% hitting Android, but we also know Apple can respond to such attacks in days, in contrast to weeks or never on some other platforms. If you work in a regulated industry you need rock solid security and no budget conscious IT chief is going to want to pay extra just to secure a platform. Security awareness is also shifting – as cloud services are becoming more widely deployed security is about protecting the data. That means secure networks, securing data on the journey to and from various endpoints, and (critically) ensuring employees fully understand good security practice. There’s some very clever phish out there. And no rational enterprise will ever permit use of devices that can’t or won’t receive regular security patches. Transformation “Studies show that companies that master digital will not only drive more revenue, but will be 29% more profitable on average,” said Rowan Trollope, Cisco’s SVP GM of IoT and Applications Group. He’s not alone, studies from everyone confirms the need to weave digital processes across enterprise relationships. This is a tidal wave and Apple’s surfing flawlessly upon it. Bloomberg recently said “More than 75 percent of all users are accessing the Bloomberg Professional app on Apple products.” Numbers The proof is in the numbers. Almost every Fortune 500 company is using iOS to some extent. Most recently a 451 Research survey found that among U.S. corporate buyers planning to purchase smartphones in the September quarter, 75% plan to purchase iPhones. Corporate buyers reported a 94% satisfaction rate for iPad in as of last June, Apple has claimed. This is not flash in the pan but a sustained trend – in 2014 97% of Fortune 500 companies were using iPhones in some capacity. The conclusion? Apple is in the enterprise and even if you don’t like it you’re going to have to get used to it. Google+?

An anonymous reader writes:According to Chinese media, Apple is launching its first research and development center in the country, located in long-time technology incubation area Zhongguancun Science Park, Beijing. While Apple has yet to comment on the matter, a statement issued by the Zhongguancun Park Management Committee to several Chinese media outlets has identified Apple's presence in the area. According to reports collated by Digitimes, the center has a budget of about $15 million, with a long-term expenditure goal of $45 million over the next few years. The center is allegedly seeking to hire around 500 workers, with no particular focus beyond Apple products and software. The move mirrors similar setups in Japan, and Israel. apple china center ← You may like to read: → Comey Denies Clinton Email 'Reddit' Cover-Up Apple Cites 'Courage' As Reason To Remove 3.5mm Headphone Jack China Threatens To Cut Sales of iPhones and US Cars if 'Naive' Trump Pursues Trade War Company Creates Gun That Looks Like a Cellphone Phil Schiller Says the MacBook Pro Doesn't Need an SD Card Slot DOJ Threatens To Seize iOS Source Code Facebook at Work To Report For Duty Next Month This discussion has been archived.

Blige on Singing to Hillary Clinton: 'She Needed to Feel That This Police Brutality Mess is a Nightmare' 9/29/2016 by Adelle Platon FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Stefanie Keenan/Getty Images for Entertainment Weekly Mary J. Blige attends the 2016 Entertainment Weekly Pre-Emmy party at Nightingale Plaza on Sept. 16, 2016 in Los Angeles. Mary J Blige is using her voice in a different way as the host of her new talk show The 411 with Mary J Blige, powered by Apple Music. For her inaugural sit-down, the Queen of Hip-Hop Soul interviews Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, an intimate conversation that shows both Blige and Clinton outside of their comfort zones.   "I'm a singer before I'm a journalist. This journalist stuff is brand new," the R&B icon told several members of the press at a private Apple Music luncheon in New York City on Wednesday (Sept. 28). While a clip of Blige singing the 2000 Bruce Springsteen song "American Skin (41 Shots)" to Clinton made its rounds on the internet and television following Monday night's presidential debate between Clinton and Republican challenger Donald Trump, Blige explained why she chose to perform the song about the killing of Amadou Diallo by New York City police in 1999 to the Secretary of State mid-interview. "The lyrics impacted me so heavily and deeply, it made me cry," she offered, adding that she didn't warm up and simply pressed play on an iPad while sitting across from Clinton. "It's like a prayer that I needed Ms. Clinton to be impacted the same way so the only way I can get that reaction from her is to sing it." Blige also admitted that she wasn't vocal during the rampant cases of police brutality that burdened the nation but used her conversation with Clinton to address the issues that mattered to her -- and her community. "I never got a chance to say anything [about police brutality] so I got an opportunity to interview Hillary Clinton and somebody like me would never get an opportunity like that -- ever," she said. Mary J. Blige Sings to Hillary Clinton About Police Brutality in Interview "The whole interview was felt," she continued. "I was blown away by how organic and real she was." Blige recalled meeting Clinton at the Democratic National Convention earlier this year, which inspired the idea of sitting with Clinton for The 411. "When I met her, she was generally concerned about what I was doing. She hugged me like a grandma -- and I needed that hug at the moment."  While on the campaign trail in San Francisco, Calif., Clinton met with Blige, who is team #ImWithHer. "What inspired me most about Secretary Clinton is the fact that she's a woman and she's running for president," she says in the clip. Clinton remains in campaign mode throughout the interview, discussing how she clings to her faith through trying times, looks to her late mother as an example of strength and what it means to be "tough and likeable." During light-hearted moments, she also offers her playlist staple (hint: Lin-Manuel Miranda) and the last Netflix show she binge-watched.  The most profound moment in the interview is when Blige sung her rendition of "41 Shots" (a proper version is slated for release this week), which sparks a dialog between the pair about the recent killings of unarmed black men and young people in America. "I have been so heartbroken over what's been going on because it's so fundamentally at odds with and wrong that African-American parents have to sit their children down and deliver the message," said Clinton. "And just say, 'Be careful' and yet we still have so many terrible deaths -- some at the hands of the police, many at the hands of others like Trayvon Martin, whose mother I've gotten to know so well." Here's the Song Mary J. Blige Sings in Her Hillary Clinton Interview Clinton then urged for a "greater opening of our hearts to one another" and offered, "I particularly want white people to understand what that's like and to feel that they must be part of the solution." She added that she will continue to work with police to improve relations between cops and communities, change mindsets and take on the gun lobby. Following the screening, Blige said that there were two topics she wished she could have incorporated into the conversation: mass incarceration and equal pay. "The question got by us not because it didn't matter because what was happening in the moment mattered more," recalled Blige, who said she researched Clinton heavily before the interview and rehearsed the questions when she was by herself. Encouraging her followers to vote also inspired the interview. "That's the whole reason for having Hillary Clinton do an interview with Mary J. Blige because so many people don't want to vote for either her or Donald," the singer said. "To have people see Mary J. Blige sit down with Hillary Clinton hopefully could get people to vote 'cause I like Hillary -- I don't give a s--t about who doesn't like Hillary." Blige noted that it was important for her to conduct the interview with Clinton from an organic place. "I don't underestimate people," she said. "We're all intelligent. We may not know or do the same things at the same time but we're all intelligent beings so I don't play games with us." She added, "I don't like things staged. I like it to flow especially with her." When asked if she will sing during every interview moving forward, she laughed. "That was just for Hillary Clinton with that specific song 'American Skin.' That won't ever happen again," she responded. "You have Hillary Clinton in the room, you're gonna be your best and try to make her feel whatever times we're in. She needed to feel that this police brutality mess is a nightmare." The debut episode of The 411 with Mary J Blige premieres on Apple Music on Sept. 30.

By Bernie Becker 09/29/16 10:00 AM EDT ON THE ONE HAND: It’s no secret that the Treasury Department has taken direct aim at Europe’s decision to slap a $14.5 billion tax on Apple, calling it a break from years of precedent that is wrongly being applied retroactively and a likely drag on the business climate. But for many tax watchers, the irony — in some cases, a bitter irony — is they think that Treasury is ignoring similar arguments as it hurries to finalize in President Barack Obama’s final months the Section 385 regulations that deal with earnings stripping. Story Continued Below “Treasury is talking out of both sides of their mouth — on the one hand saying the state aid cases are a break from precedent that create uncertainty and undermine the investment climate while simultaneously proposing 385 rules that are a break from precedent and which undermine the investment climate by creating uncertainty,” PricewaterhouseCoopers’ Rohit Kumar, a former aide to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, told Morning Tax. The business community and Republicans have basically backed the administration’s efforts to get Europe to back down, while railing against the earnings stripping rules. But those with the opposite view — pro-385 rules, but against Treasury’s staredown with the European Union — also see a contradiction. “It is ironic, to put it mildly, that Treasury defends its use of Section 385 as an innovative resurrection of a code section long given up for dead, while attacking the EC for inventing retroactive new law,” said Edward Kleinbard, the former Joint Committee on Taxation chief of staff. In fact, Kleinbard said, “EU principles of state aid have been applied continuously to tax cases for many decades.” For its part, Treasury appears to believe that its response to Europe and its Section 385 rules are different situations that shouldn’t be directly compared. And even those who do see a contradiction in Treasury’s approach acknowledge there’s one very big common bond there — in both situations, the department is seeking to preserve or enlarge the corporate tax base. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew has called the threat to the U.S. tax base the “most important” aspect of Europe’s Apple decision for American taxpayers. “We have been clear that the administration takes multinational tax avoidance very seriously,” a Treasury spokeswoman told Morning Tax, in a nod to the 385 rules. “If companies are generating income that the United States has the primary right to tax, then that same income should not effectively be taken by the commission,” the spokeswoman added.

CLINTON, SURROGATE STYLE: Remember all that confusion about whether GOP nominee Donald Trump’s new tax plan gave pass-throughs the same 15 percent rate as corporations? Well, no confusion now. Stephen Moore of The Heritage Foundation, a Trump adviser, called the single business rate the “centerpiece of our plan” at a Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget event Wednesday. Moore also pushed back against Gene Sperling, a Hillary Clinton adviser, who said the Trump plan would be a handout to the rich. (To be fair, plenty of people think that one business rate would be prone to gaming or give huge tax cuts to lawyers, hedge funds and the like.) “You get the 15 percent tax rate when you reinvest the money into the company,” Moore said. “If you take the money out in a wage or salary or as a dividend, you’re paying the dividend rate or the individual tax rate.” Sperling also railed against a part of Trump’s plan that has quickly become a Democratic line of attack — how his proposal would hike taxes on millions of families and single parents. The former adviser to Presidents Clinton and Obama said that fact made it clear that Trump, Moore and company didn’t have struggling families in mind when they got to work. “If that’s your focus,” he said, “you’re going to get that right.” THOSE LETTERS KEEP COMING: More than 40 Republican senators are openly lobbying the Treasury Department to withdraw the recently proposed valuation discounts in their current form, joining a fray that’s so far been dominated by business groups and individual companies. The senators, led by John Thune of South Dakota, told Lew the rules would eat into their efforts to offer estate tax relief and “directly contradict long-standing legal precedent, create new uncertainty for taxpayers and put family-owned businesses at a disadvantage.” Any second crack at the regulations, they added, should “more directly target perceived abuses in the valuation of transferred interests in family businesses.” The proposed rules would force more families to pay estate and gift taxes after a business is passed from one generation to another, something Treasury and the White House argue would take away another loophole exploited by the wealthy. And it’s not just letters: Sen. Marco Rubio is expected to be the lead sponsor on legislation to block the rules, which is a companion to a House bill backed by more than 40 GOP lawmakers, according to people in the know in the Capitol. BACK TO THE WELL ON REINSURANCE: Rep. Richard Neal of Massachusetts, a top Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee, is back with one of his favorite measures — a proposal that tries to stop foreign insurance companies from shifting their income here to low-tax countries without paying taxes. And this time, Neal’s been joined by Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), who introduced the measure on the other side of the Rotunda. Neal and Warner said in a release that the measure, which would limit the tax deductions that foreign insurers can take on reinsurance premiums, would also help block inversions. Neal has introduced the bill, which has gotten a mixed reception in the insurance community, several times over the past eight years. THE JORDAN RULES: Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, has made himself into one of the chamber’s most powerful figures through hardline tactics on issues like seeking to impeach IRS Commissioner John Koskinen. But POLITICO's Rachael Bade reports that Jordan’s efforts are rubbing his colleagues the wrong way. “In the case of the impeachment hearing, it gave him and his allies another cathartic moment to rake Koskinen over the coals, but the exercise mostly just angered other Republicans,” Rachael writes. THAT’S A LOT OF HEALTH CARE EXCLUSIONS: The Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center found that U.S. taxpayers wrung $1.17 trillion worth of tax breaks out of the code in 2015, our Toby Eckert reports. But as in the past, the benefits of those preferences weren't spread evenly. The top 1 percent, getting about 17 percent of pre-tax income, received more than a quarter of the benefits from tax incentives. On the other end of the spectrum, the bottom 20 percent of taxpayers get 4 percent of the tax breaks and the same amount of the pre-tax income. AUDITS TAKING A DIVE: The amount of revenue that the IRS racked up through enforcement actions fell about 5 percent in 2015, Treasury’s inspector general for tax administration said Wednesday. Toby reports that the amount of enforcement staffers also fell to its lowest level in a decade, as enforcement revenues dropped from $57.1 billion to $54.2 billion. The elephant in the room, of course: The inspector general noted that the agency’s shrinking budget in recent years played a role in both declines. INTERNATIONAL UPDATE — GIVE A LITTLE BIT: Jeremy Corbyn, the British opposition leader, is offering a deal to the business community, The Guardian reports. Give us some more in taxes, and we’ll make a National Education Service that would oversee preschool to adult education efforts. Corbyn said the corporate tax would only have to go up by under 1.5 percent to boost education in the U.K. “Business shares in economic success and it must contribute to it too,” he said. DRILLING DOWN ON THE PANAMA PAPERS: The European parliament has kicked off its inquiry into the Panama Papers, The Guardian also reports — with a special focus on the fact that about half of the 214,000 entities discussed in the Mossack Fonseca documents were registered in the British Virgin Islands. One member openly worried that a Britain outside of the European Union could grow into the “biggest tax haven in the world” and that “Britain is right at the heart of this.” STATE NEWS — CHRIS CHRISTIE TO THE DEFENSE: The New Jersey governor shrugged off criticism of his decision to end a pact with Pennsylvania that allowed residents in the two states to pay taxes where they lived, regardless of whether they worked in the other state. The current setup, Christie said, via NJ.com, merely lets rich Pennsylvanians to work the system. “People across the state in north Jersey and coastal southern Jersey could very well ask why do we have a tax compact with Pennsylvania, which allows wealthy people to work in New Jersey, to live in Bucks County, and to pay no income tax in New Jersey.” QUICK LINKS — The IRS has its own version of a SWAT team. — Swedish bankers aren’t happy about a tax aimed at their industry. — Wyoming tops the Tax Foundation’s state business climate rankings.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Hot on the heels of one report that suggested Apple is going to release new MacBook Pro computers next month, MacRumors is back with its own report. The website said that Apple will launch the new MacBook Pro, including a 15-inch model with an AMD “Polaris” graphics chip, during the second half of next month. The site suggested that Apple is currently in the final stages of testing new macOS 10.12.1 software that will support Siri integration — already part of macOS Sierra — and the highly-rumored and expected OLED bar that will reportedly exist above the keyboard. The secondary OLED display is expected to serve several purposes, including allowing customizable icons for quick launching applications, interacting with Siri, controlling music or video playback and more. MacRumors reiterated reports that Apple is also working on a new 5K display built by LG, a new MacBook Air and new iMacs, but didn’t clarify if those, too, are expected to launch next month. October is shaping up to be quite busy. Google will also unveil new hardware, including its Pixel smartphones, during an event on October 4. Apple has not yet set a date for unveiling new laptops.

This time last year, Galway County Council approved Apple’s plans for a data centre on a site near Athenry owned by Coillte. Apple said it would create 300 construction jobs and 150 jobs thereafter. The council’s decision was appealed on a number of grounds, including flooding fears and the impact on the environment and climate change. Last month, An Bord Pleanala upheld the Council’s decision and gave the go-ahead for the development. However, the High Court was today asked to consider a judicial review of that decision. Papers raising concerns about the decision-making process were handed into court by a lay litigant. Apple was not put on notice of today’s application, and the case has been adjourned until 17th October.     Main Home Death Notices News Sport Business Directory Shop Advertising Contact Media Listen Live Mobile Apps Podcasts Ireland West Music TV Midwest Irish Radio Schedule Presenters Local Jobwaves Radio Bingo Community Events Radio Station News Midwest Radio Apps Social Policy & Terms Privacy Policy Complaints Midwest West Radio Logo Outside Broadcast Unit Midwest Radio 96.1fm | Clare St, Ballyhaunis, Co.

Barclays reiterated its overweight rating on Apple shares, but removed the company's "top pick" designation on deteriorating smartphone industry trends. "While we maintain a constructive view on the long-term Apple franchise value and think next year ushers in IP8 with revolutionary advancements, the stock could be overbought given how fundamentals may not be as strong," analyst Mark Moskowitz wrote in a note to clients Thursday. "Our research indicates a recovery in global smartphone growth could be pushed out. Plus, conversations with industry participants suggest iPhone sales trends could be at risk of petering out in coming months, similar to last year's post-IP6S launch fall-out."

Apple and consulting firm Deloitte are teaming up to help organisations with their business transformation efforts through the use of Apple devices. The move is just the latest sign that Cupertino is feeling the need to get more serious about the business market than in the past. We wonder why... Apple’s latest foray into the corporate arena sees Deloitte creating what it claims as a first-of-its-kind Apple practice to advise customers. This will be staffed with over 5,000 strategic advisors focused on helping businesses transform the way their entire operation works. The centrepiece of this effort is a new service offering called EnterpriseNext, which focuses on the fruity device maker’s iOS ecosystem of hardware, software and services and how these can be applied in the workplace. Among the services EnterpriseNext reportedly offers is a team of iOS architects, designers and engineers able to build native apps to integrate with existing enterprise systems such as ERP, CRM, analytics and HR, and Workshops for iOS to “quickly take ideas from prototype to custom-built iOS solutions”. The move is the latest in a growing trend over the past couple of years for Apple to do deals with outfits that already have an established presence in the enterprise arena, in stark contrast to its traditional disdain for anything corporate. Cupertino’s affair with big business started with a deal with IBM to sell and support its iPhone and iPad models to Big Blue’s customer base, while IBM also developed a line of MobileFirst enterprise applications to run on them. Last year, the love-in moved to a deal with Cisco, focused around making Apple’s mobile devices play better with corporate Wi-Fi networking kit, among other things. This year, the deal was with SAP in a partnership to create native iOS apps for the enterprise firm's HANA analytics platform. This increased focus on corporate partnerships could be a symptom of Apple’s traditional consumer market becoming saturated, and the firm seeking territory where it can still grow demand for its iDevices. Some evidence for this can be drawn from Cupertino’s last earnings presentation, where both Tim Cook and chief financial officer Luca Maestri emphasised progress in the business arena. “We're making great progress with our enterprise initiatives and we see strong growth opportunities ahead of us,” Maestri said, going on to mention a deal with Russia's largest bank Sberbank that will see an additional 22,000 iPads deployed in mobility solutions across the organisation. However, this is a tougher sell than flogging updated phones and fondleslabs to Apple’s adoring fanbase of loyal consumers, as witnessed by the fact that Microsoft’s Surface Pro has so far comfortably outsold Apple’s professional-oriented iPad Pro. The Surface is an “easier sell” to businesses because of compatibility with the existing corporate infrastructure, as The Register pointed out following disclosure of the first quarter sales figures for both devices earlier this year. Hence the focus on doing deals with companies that are already well entrenched in the corporate market and trusted to advise and support enterprise customers with their IT strategy. Expect to see more deals like this in future. ® Sponsored: Magic quadrant for enterprise mobility management suites Tips and corrections 11 Comments Whitepapers Data and Analytics Maturity Model and Business Impact How top performing enterprises use their IT investments to store, process, and use data to make more effective, real-time decisions.

News Business Business Comment CMA to investigate price comparison sites but don't let that discourage you from switching with them They've generally been a good thing but there are issues with the way they operate. The CMA's review could also help it to put right a mistaken ruling James Moore @JimMooreJourno Thursday 29 September 2016 13:26 BST Click to follow The Independent Online Will the CMA's investigation into price comparison websites cramp the meerkats' style? Price comparison websites are a thoroughly good thing for the most part, but so is the fact that the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has launched an investigation into them.  Here’s why. The likes of confused.com, gocompare.com switch.com, moneysupermarket.com and comparethemarket.com facilitate switching between providers across a huge range of marketplaces. Energy, insurance, credit cards, home loans, personal loans, broadband, they’re all covered, and more besides. Water may be added to their number if Ofwat can make it work.  Read more Banking watchdog CMA unveils measures to help customers switch banks As such they help their users get better deals, and perhaps better service too. They also play an important role in ensuring that providers pay a price for mucking things up, one that has far more impact than fines levied by regulators. You lose your customers, you lose your business.  The trouble is they are not an unalloyed blessing. They are a useful weapon in the consumer’s armoury but they are not necessarily the punter’s best pal.  If you’re comparing markets, you really need to try two or three of them to get the best out of them because they have a habit of throwing different deals up after you’ve given them your details. You could almost do with a Gocomparetheconfuseduswtichmarket site to tell you which one is best.  Users also need to be aware that their first priority is to make money, which they do by charging commissions to the companies they list. It is partly because of this that big insurers such as Direct Line and Aviva shun their services. If you want to compare their prices you have to go direct to them.  Read more Banking watchdog CMA unveils package of measures to help customers switch accounts after two year probe Ofgem to cap prices on pre-payment energy meters and make market ‘fairer and more competitive’ Gap between Big Six energy tariffs and cheapest deals ‘has increased,’ figures show The CMA also recently ruled that they only have to list the deals from energy providers that make them money, which might make the best ones, sometimes provided by smaller outfits, hard to find.  In so dong it reversed an earlier ruling by energy regulator Ofgem, which (rightly) wants to encourage switching. That created quite the furore. The Energy Select Committee, in particular, was not best pleased. This new investigation, we are told, is completely separate from that. The CMA simply wants to to “see what issues it throws up”. It is to be hoped that the latter issue will be one of those. The CMA says it wants to “consider how to maximise the potential benefits” of price comparison websites for consumers. So it surely ought to be. It will be if the CMA knows what’s good for it.  Business picture of the day 35 show all Business picture of the day 1/35 Nintendo shares jump after it announces the launch date for Super Mario Run - Wednesday 16 November The hugely anticipated game is an attempt to capitalise on the smartphone gaming market after the phenomenal success of Pokemon Go.

Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said: “The nationalists' case for independence has been swallowed up by a £14 billion black hole.” Taxes collected from oil production fell from £1.8 billion in 2015 to just £60 million in 2016.

Trending in Apple How Apple’s stock apps will use the Touch Bar on the new MacBook Pro [Gallery] September 29 AAPL: 112.18 -1.77 As expectations grow for MacBook Pro launch next month, different reports suggest late October launch [Poll] Ben Lovejoy - 2 months ago @benlovejoy MacBook Pro View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit With numerous reports suggesting that Apple will launch a new MacBook Pro range in late October, one sketchy rumor suggests that the keynote presentation will take place on October 24. A Monday doesn’t seem particularly likely, and the ‘multiple sources’ cited are apparently just anonymous emails, but sometime around that date seems more likely than not. Logic dictates that a new OS update will be required for these new machines and if they were ready late September/early October, Apple would have added them to the September event. Additionally, Apple is known for its late October launches, having had one in October four of the past five years (skipping last year) and it wants to have its channel full of inventory for the runup to the holidays in November.  So October is a safe guess for upcoming products… IHS Securities – known for its cost-focused teardowns of Apple kit – also predicted recently that we’d be seeing a new 13-inch MacBook Air alongside the new MacBook Pro machines, supporting an earlier Bloomberg report suggesting a new iMac and 5k display (yes please!) at the same time. MacRumors also says that its ‘understanding’ is that ‘the company’s current development work on macOS 10.12.1 focused largely on preparing the operating system to support the updated hardware’s new features.’ Apple will of course need to ensure that macOS Sierra supports the two rumored hardware additions to the upcoming MacBook Pro range … We’re expecting the 2016 MacBook Pro to feature an OLED touchscreen in place of the physical function keys. Leaked images appear to show space for this bar, along with four USB-C ports. There appears to be support for my own theory that the touchscreen bar will be able to offer application-specific shortcuts as well as access to the universal controls currently offered by the function keys. The other significant new hardware feature we’re expecting is a Touch ID power button. This is likely to offer support for Apple Pay on the web, which currently requires handoff to an iPhone, as well as unlocking the Mac itself. We’ve already seen clues in macOS Sierra in terms of support for both features. We’re expecting the new machines to feature Intel Skylake processors, and an option for AMD’s Polaris GPUs. Apple has also been exploring the possibility of removing the headphone socket, but it seems unlikely it will do so this year, In terms of form-factor, the new MacBook Pro is pegged to have a smaller footprint and be thinner than existing models, but not to use the same wedge shape as the 12-inch MacBook and MacBook Air machines. We’ve seen a number of concepts showing how the new machines might look. I’m not expecting to get everything I want from the new machine, but will almost certainly bite the bullet and downgrade from my 17-inch beast to get the latest tech. What about you?

SUBSCRIBE Apple rolls out Search Ads for the App Store Ads go live October 5 -- Apple is offering $100 credit toward the first campaign. Greg Sterling on September 29, 2016 at 8:31 am More After a beta period that began in June, Apple is now opening up Search Ads for the App Store to all publishers and developers. It’s currently available for the iPhone and iPad only in the US. While Apple will certainly make money from this program, the main rationale appears to be app discovery. Google has had search ads in the Play store for well over a year. Search Ads will be delineated with a blue background. Apple will generate the ad images and copy from the app metadata supplied by the publisher or developer, so there’s no ad copy per se. It appears there will only be one ad per search. Developers set a max daily budget and an overall campaign budget. Apple’s Search Ads use the familiar “second price auction” to set winning bid prices. Apple says that relevance and bid price will determine which ads show. (Developers will pay on a “cost per tap” basis.) Search Ads allow for bidding on the iPhone or iPad individually. There’s a keyword suggestion tool, with popularity indicators and negative keyword capabilities. There are audience targeting features, including customer type (e.g., has not downloaded) gender, age and location. And of course there are analytics. App store search is the dominant way that apps are discovered. However, other discovery channels are now growing in relative importance, according to comScore. Beyond this, comScore says that roughly 50 percent of smartphone owners don’t download any new apps in a given month, while the average user downloads two apps per month.   Search Ads will go live in the App Store on October 5. Developers also receive a $100 credit for the first campaign. About The Author Greg Sterling Greg Sterling is a Contributing Editor at Search Engine Land.

Apple’s product cycles used to have a predictable cadence, but the Mac maker is now switching it up. The Motley Fool’s Dylan Lewis and Evan Niu talk about the implications for investors. Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) Sep 29, 2016 at 8:28AM Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) recently unveiled their iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, and despite some dismay around the headphone-less design, the company's stock has popped a whopping 10% on the news of record-breaking pre-order numbers. In this segment from Industry Focus: Tech, Motley Fool analysts Dylan Lewis and Evan Niu discuss what Apple's growth trajectory might look like for the next few years (given the comps they're up against), how and why the company might have to change its design cycle timeline in the not-too-distant future, where the Watch 2 fits into all of this, and why Apple is going to eventually have to come up with a new naming scheme for the iPhone line. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Sept. 16, 2016. Dylan Lewis: This recent rise that we talked about actually pushes Apple above a 13 P/E on a trailing basis for the first time in a year. Evan Niu: Ooh, so expensive! (laughs) Lewis: Yeah, right? It's kind of insane. But looking at how all of this fits into where the business is going, last quarter, the company guided for revenue between $45.5 billion and $47.5 billion. And even if they dramatically beat that guidance, which, they've typically been in the high end of their guidance range or slightly above it, they will likely fall short of previous years' number for the third straight quarter. I believe last year ago quarter, the fourth fiscal quarter, they were around $51 billion, just to give you an idea of how different the guidance is there. It's tough to keep seeing this. The product is really successful. Customer satisfaction was really great. They just keep going up against these really tough comps. Eventually that's going to change, but don't expect that trajectory to be any different for the next couple quarters. I think that's one of the key things investors need to keep in mind here. You're going to probably see year-over-year declines for this quarter, next quarter, possibly even three quarters out. Niu: I think there's a chance the iPhone 7 could, generally speaking regardless of the time... the timing for the year-over-year comps is always tricky, because it's always really dependent on when they launched the phone. In this case, they're launching the phone with two or three weeks left to the quarter. Last year, I think they had just a couple days. So, the launch timing really has a big impact on how much of that launch gets captured in which quarter. But, in general, I think there's a chance that the 7 could push the cycle up. The sense is, iPhone unit sales have picked because they've been flat-ish, roughly, over the past year, year-over-year or whatever. But if you look, every two years, they basically pushed higher because of the cycle, this two-year design cycle of 5, 5S, 6, 6S, etc. So, the performance of the sales, at least for the past two major product cycles, they tend to go in tandem. Because if most people upgrade their phones every two years, and all the people who upgraded for the 6 are probably all going to upgrade for the 7, they had this pattern of going in pairs. Who knows if that actually plays out again this year, because the sales are so high that is hard to really grow. But I think there's a possibility, particularly with all the kinds of indications that we're seeing. But I wouldn't bet on it. I'm just saying, it's like a curveball, it's possible. Lewis: We've talked in the past about the idea of two-year comps being a bit more relevant for Apple, because of the update cycle that they're on. I think, as you talked about before, their refreshes on the product become more incremental and less major step changes, then I start to look at them more on a year-over-year basis. To your point about releases, another important thing to remember here is, all the numbers that Apple will be reporting for fiscal Q4, calendar Q3, only two weeks of that period will have the iPhone 7 available. It will be a part of those numbers, but it will not be a major contributor. You're going to really want to look at fiscal Q1, calendar Q4, for what it's going to be doing for the financial statements. I'm sure we're going to get some commentary in the company call come fiscal Q4. But that's something to keep in mind. Niu: And it's weird, because this is the first time they've ever pushed a three-year design cycle. It'll be really interesting to see how that changes the performance. They've never done a three-year design cycle before. And it's also a testament to smartphones getting more mature. It's kind of like laptops. They redesign laptops every four to five years, but they would redesign their phones every two years. So now you're seeing, they feel comfortable that they can push that limit on the design side. But then, the real question is, what happens next year? Because everyone is expecting a new design next year, maybe another display, maybe no home button, maybe curb display, whatever. Then, it just throws everything out of whack, the fact that they're changing the timing of these cycles. It's going to be cool to see what happens going forward. And plus, what are they going to call it? They can't call it the 7S if they change the design altogether. Lewis: Eventually they're going to have to ditch that naming convention, one way or another. Niu: I've been saying they should ditch that thing for years. This is the iPhone 7. It's the 10th iPhone. And what, next year it'll be the iPhone 8, the 11th iPhone? It just makes no sense. Lewis: Yeah. I think, to bring it back around, and what to watch for here, if the product incremental upgrades that we talked about, some of their performance changes are visible enough to people that maybe currently hold an iPhone 6, or the offers from these wireless carriers look compelling enough, I think you could see some really great numbers for fiscal Q1, which will be calendar Q4. But you won't get a report on that for quite a bit. Be wary of that, and know that any really big enthusiasm is going to come through more on the company's call than in the numbers that the company reports next quarter. Anything else on this? That's kind of investing take away. Obviously, everything that they delivered here was what we'd been expecting from pre-launch leaks and rumors. Niu: Yeah. Everything pretty much came in right on target with expectations, as far as the product specs and things like that. I think the Watch 2 looks OK, it's kind of the same thing, Watch 2 looks like what they should have done with the first one. I don't think many people are going to upgrade from the Watch 1 to the Watch 2. It just doesn't seem very compelling. But maybe they get more first-time adopters that were on the fence about Watch 1 and didn't do it, but now Watch 2 is more compelling, a stronger product, so maybe the people that were on the fence will jump in and go ahead and be a first-time buyer for the smartwatch. And, of course, once they do that, they're on this upgrade track, and they're going to eventually upgrade, however long, who knows. Lewis: Yeah, you have the chance to win over those people who don't want to own a first-generation device with the Watch, basically. Niu: Right. I think the Watch 2 does look compelling in that sense. Of course, there's no detailed results to compare to, because Apple won't give them to us. But just generally, I think, products just get better over time. Next month, they're supposed to have these new Macbook Pros, which might reinvigorate the Mac lineup. That lineup has been there for four years. So, coming out with a new thing there could really juice the Mac performance for the next few years. Dylan Lewis owns shares of Apple.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Fuze battery case for iPhone 7 includes a headphone jack Adam Westlake - Sep 29, 2016 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit If you still haven’t gotten over the fact that Apple “courageously” killed the 3.5mm headphone jack on the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, or if the idea of using a dongle to be able to charge and use headphones at the same time is your personal form of hell, then a new third-party phone case might have just what you’re looking for. The makers of the Fuze Case have just launched an Indiegogo campaign for a solution that not only features a larger battery, but a built-in headphone jack as well. The Fuze Case works similarly to Apple’s own iPhone battery case, protecting the phone while also plugging into the device’s Lightning port. This allows it to add an extra 2,400mAh of battery life to the iPhone 7 and 3,600mAh to the 7 Plus, but it goes a step farther than Apple’s official offering. The case basically incorporates the Lightning to 3.5mm adapter that’s included with every iPhone 7, offering a headphone jack next to the charing port on the bottom — just like the iPhones of previous years. This solutions promises headphones use “no dongles, no adapters, no problems,” the project writes. “Fuze restores 3.5mm audio jack for iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. It delivers a doubled battery life as well as scratch and shock protection, all while maintaining the iPhone’s compact profile. We need your help to bring back the jack. When you purchase Fuze, you purchase the freedom of choice.” The Indiegogo page says the Fuze Case is made out of TPU and ABS plastics, only adds about 5mm to the thickness of the iPhone 7, and will be available in five colors: white, black, gold, rose gold, and blue. Also note that the Fuze Case has a much more pleasing profile that Apple’s own Lightning battery case, with no sign of a “hump” that the latter was criticized for when it debuted last year. Early backers will be able to buy a Fuze Case for $49, but that price will soon rise to $59 as more people place orders. The case is expected to start shipping in December and will eventually be sold at retail for $69. Just note that the accessory does not have the same water resistance as the iPhone 7, so if you get one, make sure to keep your device from getting wet.

Tim Cook took to the stage and revealed it was 25 years since the company unveiled its first ever laptop. There were little surprises as the Apple execs lined up to run through the features of the brand new 2016 MacBook Pro. The main draw was the new Touch Bar sensor that runs above the keyboard. It allows you to perform a variety of different tasks depending on what program you're running. This week's event marked a bit of a change in the Apple calendar - the last time it held an event in October was 2014 when it unveiled the iPad Air 2 and its newest iMac.

Apple claims they are the thinnest and lightest laptops it has ever made. Read More Both models have a new Force Touch trackpad and feature TouchID - the fingerprint reader also on iPhones - meaning you can sign into websites and pay for items with Apple Pay. However, the stand-out feature is a new OLED touchpad above the keyboard that Apple is calling a Touch Bar, which can be can be customised depending on how you want to use it.

Lifestyle Tech Features T3 Awards: Tech companies hold their own Oscars, featuring the best products of the year The awards like to think of themselves as the tech's Academy Awards, giving out prizes to the best products and the people who made them David Phelan Thursday 29 September 2016 11:14 BST Click to follow The Independent Tech will.i.am takes part in an interview on stage as he wins the Tech Personality of the Year Award at the T3 Gadget Awards 2016 Tim P. Whitby/Getty Images What makes a great gadget? A must-have innovation? A slick interface? Killer design? Last night in London, technology magazine T3 revealed its gadgets of the year and, since this was the magazine’s tenth year of awards, its gadget of the decade. That, it turned out, was the iPhone, which can fairly be said to have ticked all the boxes above. Its innovative streak began with the first iPhone, first sold in 2007, when it brought us the pinch-to-zoom effect we now take for granted. The iPhone won through votes from T3 Magazine’s readers. T3 is one of several awards nights coming up in the next few weeks, all of which put the year’s releases into sharp relief. Next is the What Hi-Fi Awards, a mammoth event with over 100 winners including, I kid you not Best AV Cable. Best of all, there’s the Pocket-lint Awards which are unique in polling opinions from, and inspiring lively discussion between, a wider range of technology journalists, including the Independent. Pocket-lint.com is a long-established tech website and the awards are a keen example of founder Stuart Miles’ determination to welcome opinion from every angle: his staff, rival publications and the site’s readers.

And as the star told the Independent last night, he’s hard at work improving the skillset for Aneeda, the voice-activated interface that powers gadgets like the dial, his smart cuff and developing the handsome Bluetooth headphones that come with it. There were also personality awards to Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales and Eben Upton, founder of Raspberry Pi and award presenters included BBC stalwarts Rory Cellan-Jones and (best of all), Johnny Ball, who had more energy, wit and charm than anyone else on stage. Read more Apple iPhone awarded ‘gadget of the decade’, but new one misses out Among products garlanded were the Naim Mu-so Qb, a small but extremely powerful wireless speaker that sounds tremendous for a one-box system. Replaceable grilles mean you can choose from blue, red, orange or black as the colour for your hi-fi – the Qb offers killer design thanks to a distinctive aluminium heat sink at its back and a deeply attractive, tactile touchscreen dial. Naim has built amazing sound into the Qb, and while it’s not cheap (£595) compared to Naim’s high-end models which can run to £100,000, it’s something of a bargain. Apple didn’t win Phone of the Year, one of T3’s most-anticipated gongs, which went to Samsung for its Galaxy S7 edge smartphone. I think the latest handset, the Galaxy Note 7 is even better, but as it’s only now becoming available after the battery-related product recall, this is a deserved win. Samsung had a good night overall, thanks to winning Brand of the Year and the award for Wearable Technology of the Year for its Gear S2 watch. And if you like that, the soon-to-be-released S3 is a real leap forward, so it may figure in next year’s awards. Sony was a big winner, too, grabbing camera of the year for the Sony A7R II, a spectacularly good mirrorless camera with 42.2MP sensor and great performance. And it took home the award for the best TV, the XD93. That’s a great TV but more recent models from Panasonic and indeed Sony, raise the bar much higher so, again, expect more awards to follow for these brands. There were awards for less obvious candidates, too, so the Connected Home Tech of the Year went to Dyson for the Pure Cool Link fan which cools the air as it purifies it, all controllable from a smartphone. And the Ring Video Doorbell which lets you see who’s at the door from your smartphone screen whether your six feet or 6,000 miles away, won the Editor’s Choice Award. The very top accolade, Gadget of the Year, presented in association with EE went to HTC for its amazing Vive Virtual Reality system. The same product also won Gaming Product of the Year. T3’s judges included the magazine’s staff, plus tech industry cognoscenti such as the Sun’s Daniel Jones and Hannah Bouckley from Press Association. I may not have agreed with every choice but the awards provide a key insight into the trends and highlights of the tech world.

A company as technologically advanced and wealthy as Apple should produce a press event for a major product introduction comparable to a "Hollywood experience." Maybe it should hire Industrial Light and Magic, Disney's special effects arm, to stage its events. Commentaries from the technical press who were present made it sound even worse than how it appeared online. In decades of daily coverage of consumer electronics I attended over a thousand press events, most were a snooze. One of the few companies that rose to the occasion was Bose, which frequently staged clever, innovative events. These days, Bose keeps its presentations down to one hour. Most good press events run an hour or less. However, Apple did something right because the iPhone 7 is flying off the shelves. Yet, with the iPhone 7/7s it appears Apple is running out of ideas. They are both first-rate phones that should please users, but they are not better than the competition. Eliminating the conventional headphone jack, which Apple claimed was "courageous," in reality is an exceptional act of arrogance. Not only will users need to connect an adapter to use any of the billions of existing headphones on the planet, but because of Apple's Lightning connector you can't easily charge the battery and use headphones simultaneously (or do certain other external functions simultaneously). Belkin already offers a $40 adapter that's a rather large dongle that solves part of, but not the entire problem. While Android phones may follow Apple's misguided path, the USB-C port they use is far more versatile when it comes to connecting multiple external devices, although an adapter will be required. USB-C is more of an industry standard than Apple's Lightning connector. Apple claimed the second lens of the dual camera 7s is telephoto. It's not. It is double the wide-angle lens of the first camera, making it equivalent to a standard 50mm lens on an SLR camera. Corporate hubris takes its toll. RCA, the No. 1 brand for many years, met its demise with the Selectavision video disc player. Sony, which enjoyed 15 years as the most prestigious electronics company, first stumbled with Betamax, but sealed its fate with MiniDisc. Had Sony abandoned MiniDisc to create a device similar to the iPod (which it had the resources to do), it might not be an also-ran today. Furthermore, Sony even owned a major record label from which to provide content and could easily have set up an online music store. Sony invented the first eBook reader but let it die on the vine. Apple soon may reach possible point of technical and cultural irrelevance. I've received emails from readers upset by Mediacom's email port change and curious as to why even when they changed the ports on their email clients they still could not connect. Security/encryption protocols accompany each port. You need to select not only the correct encryption for each port, but the latest version of it. Mediacom's travails are minor compared with readers who have no cable internet access. Pity this reader: "We have Hughes.net satellite service. It hasn't been very satisfying. Even though we have signed up for their 'fastest' package it's disappointing. "Often we have difficulty in acquiring downloading, slowness or not at all, for periods of time even in clear weather." You basically have two choices: wireless rural microwave internet or using the cellular network. Both have their pros and cons. Cellular internet comes with the bonus of being able to use your cellphone and computer on the same network and those network speeds increase on a regular basis. If Frontier supplies your landline phone service, it slowly but surely is expanding its rural DSL broadband service.

You are also correct that Sony is a horrible company, and that Apple should learn from Sony's mistakes.  Sony was so foolish as to promote their own technology, regardless of the fact that Betamax had better picture quality than VHS.  To this day, I will not purchase a Sony product because of the choice they made 30 years ago.  I also fault them for not inventing the ipod, online streaming music, and the wheel. Apple should certainly watch their step with their promotions, since they are so strapped for cash.  In the future they should consult a person who is as wise, respected, and famous as you are.

Diversity comes in the form of 450 varieties of organic apples in one place as the Salt Spring Island Apple Festival returns Sunday to Fulford Hall in Ganges. It’s the 17th year of the event, which organizers tout as a chance for mortals to visit apple heaven while still on earth. The island’s connection with apple orchards dates back to the 1860s, when it supplied Lower Mainland and Vancouver Island markets. “We have the biggest selection of apple varieties in Canada in one place,” said Harry Burton, founder of the event. Tables at Fulford Hall will groan with the weight of the many displays. About 20 farms will be open to the public on the day of the festival, where visitors will have a chance to sample many of the varieties they saw at the hall Looking for a particular variety? A photo of each will be shown on the Apple Festival website, and organizers can connect apple-lovers with the tree that grows that particular variety. People can buy the trees from the apple farmers. Some dwarf varieties are already potted and available immediately, while others must be ordered for pickup in the spring. Trees can take up to five years before they produce fruit. “I call it the five-year itch,” said Burton, owner of Apple Luscious Organic Orchard. “Because I am itching to find out what it will taste like.” He is also on a mission to get people to try less-than-perfect-looking apples. “Some apples might look ugly, but the taste will blow you away,” he said. Apple experts will be on hand for consultation, and can help identify apples brought to the festival. If you like apple pies, you are in luck. The Pie Ladies will offer a wide selection of baked apple pies made with specific varieties. Last year, there were 26 varieties to choose from. Buy by a slice or a whole pie or mix and match six slices to make up one pie. Other desserts, such as apple tarts and cookies, will also be available. If you get tired of tasting apples, you can purchase lunches prepared by island chefs or savour other locally produced food, such as cheese, wine, beer and, of course, cider. Face painting, even for adults, is available. Admission is $10 for adults, $5 for students and free for children. The event runs from 9 to 5 p.m. Oct. 2 at Fulford Hall, 2591 Fulford Ganges Rd. and at various orchards (a map of participating farms is not released until 9 a.m. Sunday). Tickets are available at Fulford Hall and the Ganges Tourist Information Centre, 121 Lower Ganges Rd. For more information, go to saltspringapplefestival.org.   You’re invited to try fresh-hop beers at Centennial Square Fresh to Death kicks off B.C. Craft Beer Month with an opportunity to sample 20 fresh hop beers from around the province, on Saturday at Centennial Square. Fans of craft beer typically salivate as fall nears, because it signals the annual harvest of the mighty hop. Craft breweries travel to hop farms all around the province to collect fresh hops still wet and juicy from the harvest. They then race back to their breweries to brew a batch of special fresh-hop (or wet-hop) beers. “Using fresh hops can add a really distinct character to the brew,” said Joe Wiebe, the host of the event, in its second year. “It can vary greatly from brewer to brewer, and the hops also come from different farms.” He said that the event is an opportunity for various breweries to showcase their skills in creating this seasonal beer. The brew can range from the popular India Pale Ale to other ales. Participants include local, Vancouver Island and mainland breweries: Bomber, Dageraad, Dogwood, Driftwood, Fernie, Four Mile, Hoyne, Lighthouse, Longwood, Old Yale, Postmark, Spinnakers, Steel & Oak, Strathcona, Tree, Wolf and others. This is the first year the event is to be held at Centennial Square and Wiebe believes that it will lead to more walk-ups. More than 300 people attended last year’s event. The event is put on by the Victoria Beer Week Society and sponsored by Liquor Plus. Tickets are $25 and include entry, a four-ounce glass sampler and three drink tickets, each good for one serving. Additional samples are available for $1.75 each. The event runs from 1 to 6 p.m. Saturday in Centennial Square. Tickets are available online at freshtodeath2016.eventbrite.ca.   Youngsters can get free stamps at VICPEX show Children are eligible to receive free stamps just by attending the VICPEX 2016 Stamp and Postcard Show, Saturday and Sunday at the Comfort Inn. This is the 77th year of the event, hosted by members of the local stamp-collecting community. It is one of a number of events hosted annually by stamp-collecting clubs from Greater Victoria and Vancouver Island. Members at this weekend’s event will set up displays of their collections to compete for one of 11 trophies awarded at the show, including Most Popular Exhibit and Junior Trophy.   Dealers from Alberta and B.C. will also be on hand to buy, sell or appraise stamps and postcards. Admission is by donation. The event runs from 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Saturday and 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Sunday at the Comfort Inn, 3020 Blanshard St. For more information, go to vicstamps.com.       Park walks look at birds, spiders    Learn about spiders and birds during guided walks offered by CRD Parks at two regional parks Saturday and Sunday. Geoffery Newell is a CRD guest naturalist at Birds of Beechey Head, a guided hike for participants age nine and older on Saturday. Walk up Beechey Head at East Sooke Regional park to observe raptors during their fall migration. The event is free and runs from 9 a.m. to noon at the East Sooke park. Meet at the Aylard Farm parking lot off Becher Bay Road. Don’t tell anyone suffering from arachnophobia (fear of spiders) that anywhere they walk in B.C., they will always be less than a metre away from a spider. Arachnophobes probably won’t be anywhere near Elk/Beaver Lake Regional Park on Sunday as CRD Parks presents Spectacular Spiders, a guided walk for those five and older. The walk will be hosted by guest naturalists Claudia and Darren Copley, who will take people on an hour and a half expedition in search of spiders — and more. The activity is free to join — meet at the Beaver Lake Nature Centre, off the main parking lot of Elk/Beaver Lake Regional Park at 2 p.m. The park is on B.C. Transit route #70 and #72. Participants are advised to arrive 10 minutes before the start of the program and leave pets at home. For more information, go to crd.bc.ca/parks.    Royal B.C. Museum hosts family night  The Royal B.C. Museum is offering themed events in October that showcase the diversity of its collection. October kicks off with Night at the Museum, a family sleepover that allows participants to explore the Mammoths! Giants of the Ice Age exhibition without the crowds, go on a midnight behind-the-scenes tour and wake up with morning yoga. Tickets are $80 (10 per cent discount for members). The event starts at 6:30 p.m. Saturday. On Sunday, museum biologists Claudia Copley, Darren Copley and Robb Bennett go into the field on a search for local spiders during Fieldtrippers: Spider Sunday! The event is by donation. It runs from 11 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. at Beaver Lake Nature Centre, (located next to the main parking lot) at Elk/Beaver Lake Regional Park. On Wednesday, drop in for a free lunch-time lecture, Live @ Lunch: Invertebrate Collections. Heidi Gartner, collections manager for the museum, will share what she discovered while researching in the field during the summer. The event is free. It runs from noon to 1 p.m. Oct. 5 in the Community Room (right behind Sequoia Coastal Coffee) at the museum, 675 Belleville St. For more information, go to royalbcmuseum.bc.ca. © Copyright Times Colonist Email to a Friend Your Email Address: * Your Name: * To Email Address: * Message: * * Please separate multiple email addresses with the semi-colon character.

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady Leaked document explains how Apple tracks communication via, shares information with law enforcement Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Thursday, September 29th, 2016, 05:01 Category: iOS, iPhone, Legal, News, privacy, security Tweet In the complicated balancing act between privacy and security, it looks like Apple has been handing the phone number you’ve called over to the police. Following this year’s FBI investigation and Apple’s vows of privacy protection, it appears that Apple in fact keeps a log of everyone you try to contact using iMessage, according to a leaked document found by The Intercept. These logs contain personal contact information, including phone numbers, and are stored in Apple’s servers for 30 days before being deleted. Furthermore, Apple has shared these server logs with police after being compelled by a court order. While Apple has touted iMessage’s end-to-end encryption, meaning the contents of sent messages cannot be accessed outside of its original iOS device, the company is apparently storing both contact information and metadata every time the device sends a message. Apple acknowledged sharing certain data from its server logs with police and sent the following statement along: “In some cases, we are able to provide data from server logs that are generated from customers accessing certain apps on their devices. We work closely with law enforcement to help them understand what we can provide and make clear these query logs don’t contain the contents of conversations or prove that any communication actually took place.” According to the logs, every time you send a message, the Messages app pings the Apple servers to check if the recipient is a fellow iMessage user. Apple keeps a log of all these queries, including the phone numbers or contact information of the parties involved, date, time, IP address and email address, if applicable. Apple stores this information on its servers for 30 days, even if the recipient turned out not to be using iMessage. Phone companies also comply with similar court orders all the time, sharing metadata and call logs, so this new information simply means the iPhone is on par with other smartphones. However, Apple has a reputation as a staunch guardian of users’ privacy, which opens up yet another can of worms. Stay tuned for additional details as they become available.

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady Rumor: Apple to released next-gen MacBook Pro in October, units will ship with macOS 10.12.1 onboard Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Thursday, September 29th, 2016, 05:47 Category: Hardware, MacBook Pro, macOS, Rumor, Touch ID Tweet Apple tends to release things when it feels they’re complete and the current rumor has the next-gen MacBook Pro slated for October. The new 15-inch MacBook Pro will reportedly switch to “Polaris” graphics chips from AMD, which claims Apple could have new units ready to ship sometime in the second half of October. As mentioned before, the updated notebook is rumored to feature a Touch ID bar along the top of the keyboard. This will act as an OLED touch bar that will adapt as needed and replace the function keys. Apple hasn’t made a significant update to the MacBook Pro lineup since May 2015, but that only upgraded the internals and added Force Touch to the trackpad. The October refresh will likely contain some of the biggest changes Apple has made to its notebooks in years. The current word is that Apple is just waiting for development of macOS 10.12.1 to finished to allow the new MacBook Pro to support the revamped hardware’s new features. Apple has already begun seeding macOS 10.12.1 betas to the developer community and is supposedly set to seed one more beta early next week. This version is said to be that much more polished and will then be loaded onto hardware currently in production. Stay tuned for additional details as they become available.

Ireland’s perennial champion trainer announced on Wednesday that the two parties have agreed to go their separate ways after Mullins raised his training fees and Gigginstown, which is run by Ryanair’s Michael O’Leary and his brother, Eddie, refused to pay the new rate. Elliott, who trained Don Cossack to win the Cheltenham Gold Cup for Gigginstown in March, will be one of the main beneficiaries, with around 20 horses making the journey from Closutton to Cullentra. Lorraine O'Sullivan - The Sun Dublin 3 Elliott had the biggest success of his career last year when winning the Gold Cup with Don Cossack Asked when he heard the news, Elliott said: “Just yesterday morning, the same as everyone else. “It’s obviously nice to get a few new horses, but it was a big shock. “I was speaking to Eddie and Michael (O’Leary) last night, they were very straight with everything and it’s a nice opportunity for us. “The horses are coming just before lunchtime today. I think there’s just short of 20 to come, there’s a few nice horses and we’re looking forward to seeing them.” The County Meath-based trainer said he planned to speak with Mullins over the next few days . “No one really knows what the ins and outs of the whole thing are, but it does happen – we all lose horses,” Elliott told At The Races. “You can’t refuse them, they’re world-class horses and we’re in a very lucky position to be getting them. “I haven’t spoken to Willie yet, obviously he’s plenty on his hands. I’ll speak to him before the weekend, either at the races or I’ll give him a ring. “I’d say Willie is in a position where he’s got a lot of horses waiting to come in. He’s a genius at what he does and I’m sure he’ll be doing his best to keep all his staff. He’ll make the right decision.” Getty Images 3 Apple’s Jade (left) is an exciting young recruit for Elliott Among the horses set to join Elliott are Gold Cup third Don Poli and exciting filly Apple’s Jade, who was runner-up in last season’s Triumph Hurdle before bolting up at Aintree and Punchestown. Elliott said: “I need to go through the form of all the horses, but Don Poli is obviously very good. “Willie has done a wonderful job with him and it will be hard to improve him, but if we can keep him at the same level we should have plenty of fun with him. “She (Apple’s Jade) looked very good and obviously she’d be one of the ones you’d be really excited about getting. “We need to learn a bit about her.” With an increased string of “around 160 to 165 horses for the track”, Elliott looks to have his biggest chance yet of being crowned champion National Hunt trainer in Ireland. However, he expect Mullins to be a tough nut to crack once again. He said: “It’s something I dream about – someday being champion trainer – but I’m realistic to know that even with Willie losing this number of horses, he’s going to be a hard man to beat for a long time. “He’s a wonderful trainer and a nice man, too. “I’ll be trying hard. It might not happen this year but hopefully it will happen someday.” Henry de Bromhead, Joseph O’Brien, Mouse Morris – who won the Grand National this year with the Gigginstown-owned Rule The World – and Noel Meade are the other trainers reportedly set to receive a share of the ex-Mullins’ horses. Crispin Rodwell - The Sun Dublin 3 Gold Cup hero Don Cossack may not race again Elliott also revealed that Don Cossack is set to go back into training next month in the hope he has made a full recovery from injury. However, should he not be entirely happy with how the nine-year-old takes to being back in work, he will not hesitate in retiring him. At the moment, Elliott reports the recuperation to be going swimmingly with Don Cossack undergoing regular road work. The horse, owned by Gigginstown House Stud, was last seen winning the Timico Cheltenham Gold Cup in March. He subsequently suffered a tendon injury when being prepared for the Bibby Financial Services Ireland Punchestown Gold Cup in April. “He’s going into his sixth week on the roads having roadwork and the scans have been very good. I saw him last Sunday week and the legs felt good. “When a horse gets a ligament injury it’s day by day, but it seems to be going good and we’ll have back here at Cullentra in the next two or three weeks and it’s all systems go. “We’re under no illusions. If he’s not 120 per cent right at this stage, we’ll retire him. “He’s been a wonderful horse, so we’ll do the best thing for the horse.” READ MORE BETTER THAN EVER Alan King reports Yanworth to be a stronger horse this season ahead of his reappearance in the Coral Hurdle at Ascot MULLINS WOE Plans for both Annie Power and Faugheen are on hold after they suffered setbacks this week ASCOT BEST Connections of God's Own have swerved stepping him up to three miles at Haydock due to the ground TOP WEIGHT CHALLENGE Unowhatimeanharry will bid to become the fourth horse to carry top weight to victory in the Fixed Brush Hurdle Topics Gordon Elliott Willie Mullins Horse racing Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Comments Comments Most Read in Sport Exclusive Red red Wayne Boozy Wayne Rooney is almost too drunk to stand as he's pictured with two women after gatecrashing wedding… Football Pictured REVVED UP ROO Wayne Rooney gives thumbs-up as he arrives for Manchester United training following wedding booze storm Football WAYNE'S SHAME Boozy Rooney issues grovelling apology after being pictured 's***-faced' as he and pal gatecrashed wedding Football Exclusive Welsh Wonders Real Madrid to launch shock £25m bid for Aaron Ramsey to reunite Arsenal star with Gareth Bale Football Exclusive 3 LIONS IN 4AM BENDER Up to TEN England aces face FA drinking ban probe after massive nightclub booze-up... as drunken… Football SORT THIS MESS Barcelona president has called Lionel Messi's dad to start negotiations as fears continue to grow Football Poll ED'S CASE Eden Hazard wins Premier League player of the month... but did Chelsea star deserve to?

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Senator Hatch Holds Utah Tech Tour this Friday with Apple's CEO | Main | Apple Reveals New Advances for Future OLED Displays & Revisits Ambient Light Apple Watch Invention » September 29, 2016 Apple Invents a Magnetic Array System Allowing an Apple Pencil to Securely Attach to an iPad +   Ever since Apple introduced their iPad Pro, users have wondered aloud why Apple didn't allow the Apple Pencil to magnetically attach to the body of the iPad – or least have the option of purchasing an iPad Pencil holder accessory as illustrated here. Today's patent application clearly shows us that Apple is working on a new magnetics system that will allow a future Apple Pencil to attach to the side of an iOS device such an iPhone or iPad. The new magnetics system could also allow two iPads to be attached side-by-side like a notebook; be a part of a new protective case mechanism to better protect against free-falls and provide advanced feedback for playing a virtual piano in GarageBand.   Apple's Invention: Dynamically Stabilized Magnetic Array   Apple's invention covers an iPad that includes at least the following elements: a power source; an electromagnet; a magnetic field sensor that includes a switch that electrically couples the electromagnet with the power source to energize the electromagnet when changes detected by the magnetic field sensor in a magnetic field fall within a predefined range of magnetic field characteristics; and a device housing enclosing the power source, the electromagnet and the magnetic field sensor.   Further, a portable electronic device, either an iPad or iPhone, could include at least a number of electromagnet assemblies, each of the electromagnet assemblies including an electromagnet, a magnetic field sensor and a switch, the switch allowing electrical energy from the power source to energize the electromagnet when the magnetic field sensor detects a magnetic field falling within a predefined range of magnetic field characteristics; and a permanent magnet configured to secure a magnetically attractable device to an exterior surface of the portable electronic device.   In addition, a portable computing device could include a housing formed of a non-ferrous material; a display assembly disposed within the housing; a battery; and a number of electromagnet assemblies disposed within the housing, each of the electromagnet assemblies comprising an analog switching mechanism that supplies power to an electromagnet from the battery when a sensing coil detects a changing magnetic field meeting a predefined magnetic field characteristic.   Permanent Magnets to Connect iPad to Apple Pencil   Apple's patent FIGS. 3A-3B noted above shows various implementations of an iPad that includes sensor actuated electromagnets that can be configured to actuate upon detecting a magnetic field consistent with an Apple Pencil or span device. Apple's patent FIG. 3A shows Apple Pencil having permanent magnet arrays #304 and #306 affixed to one side of the iPad.   This type of system can be embodied in any number of ways. For example, in some embodiments, when the Apple Pencil and iPad are in communication by way of a wired or wireless connection such as Bluetooth, orientation sensors in both the tablet and the stylus can be compared to determine whether alignment of the Apple Pencil. When misalignment is detected, the electromagnets can emit a quick pulse that guides magnets within the Apple Pencil into a predefined position. Alternatively the quick pulsing can be periodically emitted whenever the Apple Pencil is in wireless communication with the iPad.   Apple's patent FIG. 3B shows another optimization of a magnetic connection for a stylus or span connector in which an orientation of the stylus or span device can be corrected to align with an associated electronic device.   Magnets in iPad Protective Case for Fall Protection   Apple's patent FIG. 4A noted above shows an implementation in which electromagnets within an iPad could be configured to interact with permanent magnets and/or magnetically attractable material embedded within a protective case #410 to reduce damage to the iPad in the event of a fall. iPad sensors along the lines of accelerometers and/or gyroscopes could be configured to determine any time the iPad is in free fall and determine a most likely point of impact a position of the iPad within protective case could be adjusted by activating select electromagnets. The magnetically attractable material of yjr protective case could include magnetically attractable or magnetized material. In some embodiments, the magnetically attractable material could include a flexible steel shell that can be manipulated by the iPad's electromagnets so that a distance between corner #412 of protective case and iPad could be maximized by engaging electromagnets #102-1 and 102-2 of the iPad to maneuver it towards a top-most corner of the protective case. 410 as depicted in FIG. 3D. In some embodiments instead of forming all of protective case 410 of magnetically attractable material only discrete elements 414 can be magnetically attractable or magnetic.   In Apple's patent FIG. 4B we're able to see how electromagnets 102-1 and 102-2 bias the iPad towards magnetically attractable elements #414 of the protective case. Once corner #412 of the protective case impacts a hard surface the space between protective case and the iPad forms a crush zone that reduces a rate at which force from the impact is imparted to the iPad, thereby reducing a likelihood of damage.   In some embodiments, power supplied to the electromagnets 102-1 and 102-2 can be slowly reduced to further be controlled. This can be particularly effective once the established crush zone has flattened and no longer has any give left as it can allow even greater control over a rate of deceleration. FET switches within the iPad could be utilized to determine when movement of the iPad with respect to the protective case exceeds a predetermined threshold. Such a detection even by the FET switches could be used to adjust motion of the iPad with respect to the protective case by activating select electromagnets.   Connecting Two iPads Together   Since 2013 Apple has been working on a way to eventually allow power users to connect two iPads together via magnetics. In today's patent application Apple advances their magnetics system to hopefully bring this feature to market in the not-too-distant future.     GarageBand Application   Apple notes that in some embodiments, the iPad could be configured to display a piano style keyboard interface as depicted in FIG. 5D. In a piano configuration, the keyboard would be made up of two types of keys, black keys 554 and white keys 556. In some embodiments, only the black keys could be elevated while the white keys are defined only by visual cues provided by display #502. In some embodiments, the white keys could be elevated only half as much as black keys so that tactile feedback could be provided for each key of the keyboard. In some embodiments, corresponding combinations of electromagnets and permanent magnets can be larger or smaller depending upon an amount of resolution desired when defining three-dimensional shapes upon the iPad's display. While a piano layout is depicted other embodiments are also possible – such as for example a drum layout or in some cases a standard keyboard layout.   Patent Credits   Apple patent application 20160284497 was originally filed in March 2015. Considering that this is a patent application, the timing of such a product to market is unknown at this time.   Patently Apple presents a detailed summary of patent applications with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each such patent application is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trade Office.

Alongside Cook for the trip, notably, is Johny Srugi, Apple’s Vice President of Hardware Technologies, a graduate of Technion, Israel’s Institute of Technology… Rumors surfaced a couple weeks ago that the Apple CEO planned a visit to Israel sometime this month, in part to tour a new set of Apple offices opening in Herzliya, Israel. Based on the size of the office space, Apple is expected to staff between 600 and 1,200 employees in the new buildings. Cook’s visit to Israel follows a stop in Germany at the beginning of the week as the Apple chief visited the newsroom of the famous German newspaper BILD with its editors-in-chief. Cook also met with German Chancellor Angela Merkel to discuss privacy and security issues. Earlier in the week Cook shared a photo from the glass maker in Augsburg for Apple’s Campus 2 project. Earlier this week, Apple announced plans for a $1.9 billion investment for two of the world’s largest clean energy data centers planned for Europe alongside Cook’s international tour.

Try talking to Palestinians who lost their homes when Israel stole their land to build illegal settlements, or Palestinians whose farms were demolished or burnt to the ground by Israelis, or perhaps the residents of Gaza whose children were blown to pieces during the mass communal punishment and genocide which flattened Gaza recently. Israel is the very definition of a rogue, terrorist state, one in which dozens of UN rulings are ignored, one in which an entire race of people is regularly terrorised, attacked, and brutalised, and one in which a giant wall separates two races. To defend Israel is to defend the indefensible. LikeLike Brian Marquis (@briangmarquis) - 2 years ago Reply @inaba-kun deflect much?

LikeLiked by 1 person macusersince1984 - 2 years ago Somehow I can’t get behind a Palestinian Apartheid state which continually postpones elections, jails dissenters, fails to act on honor killings and promotes the ethnic cleansing of Jews from the west bank and Jerusalem just because they aren’t Arabs or Muslims. And that’s just the Palestinian Authority – when you read the Hamas Charter you find that they are even worse. 95% of the Palestinian population lives in Areas A and B or in Gaza and under Palestinian civilian governance. Only 5% of the population lives in Area C where the settlements are. Few if any Arabs have been “displaced” from their homes – that’s a myth. Most settlements were build on previously vacant land and are leased from the State. Nor are Palestinians a “race” – for the Israelis this is entirely a political struggle. What Apple is about is bringing great people and great technology together. Their local VP, as the article states, is an Arab graduate of the Technion. inaba-kun should be ashamed to flaunt his political propaganda and divisiveness into a technical forum.

The President, much like a monarch in England, has very few duties other than ceremonial. The President appoints the Prime Minister and is often seen merely as a figurehead. They’re often esteemed characters within society and are someone to look up to. For instance Shimon Peres, the former President, was viewed as a dove and an innovator within Israeli society. He had much better relations with the West than Netanyahu who antagonised a lot of allies. Because of this Peres was often used for diplomatic purposes because he got on so well with other leaders.

Receive comments via RSS Add a comment Lewis Butler   2016-09-28 16:28 I am reasonably sure that they don't have a choice. SMS messages require logging, and Apple doesn't know if the message is SMS until it checks the phone number. The only way to 'scrub' that information is if Apple then ties the phone number you entered to a SMS-only contact or a iMessage contact. If it ties it to an iMessage contact, that leaks far more information (person has an iCloud account tied to that number) than simply logging the data they are required by law to log. The moral of this story: don't use phone numbers unless you have to.

What to expect in the two tablets?  Apple rumor: iPad Pro 2 to arrive in two models? Hi-tech crowd is going to be amazed by the new iPad Pro if rumors are to be true. The great analyst Ming Chi-Kuo has stated in his report, "We expect three new iPads (12.9" iPad Pro 2, new size 10.5" iPad Pro & low-cost 9.7" iPad) to be launched in 2017", as reported by MacRumors. Analyzing his comment, Kuo makes no mention about iPad Mini 5 but classifying all of the three variants as the new iPads. This could mean that the low-cost iteration that comes in 9.7 inch size could have another name or could it be the iPad Mini new size? And that leaves us two iPad Pros which he clearly mentions: 12.9-inch and 10.5-inch tablets - built with the same chip. Apple rumor: iPad Pro 2 possible specifications Kuo goes on to say that the new iPad lineup will get A10X chip but the 9.7-inch iPad will get A9X instead. Thus, it is unlikely that iPad Pro 2 will come in three variants but one model gets a different processor. Apple rumor: iPad Pro radical overhaul - not until 2018 that we see an AMOLED display on the tablet The Apple Pencil is said to be more advanced as Apple integrates the feature in many applications across the OS instead of in limited developed apps like the current model has to offer, Bloomberg reported. This would make it similar to the stylus in Samsung Galaxy Note series. Kuo's analysis that states about the A10X chip could be true as internal sources who spoke to Bloomberg has also mentioned about smoother navigation to scroll, pan and zoom. This means a new and faster technology is used and it could be coupled with bigger storage base as well. Apple rumor: iPad Pro 2 to get 2017 release date? In July, University Herald reported about the A10X chipset that will go under the hood of the new iPad Pro. It is based on a report of interview with Taiwan's semiconductor who hints at the tablet release in 2017. Furthermore, Motley Fool has also mentioned about iPad Pro 2 specs and claimed that 10 nanometer chip production stage will begin at the end of 2016. The rumors corroborate what recent reports have to say about iPad Pro 2 released in 2017.     Tags iPad Pro 2, macbook pro 2016, ipad pro 2 release date, a10x chip in ipad, ming chi kuo analyst © 2016 University Herald, All rights reserved.
