File/AP  Beware, iPhone users: Fake retail apps surge before holidays By Vindu Goel New York Times News Service Nov 13, 2016 (…) Buy Now Apple said it takes customers' security "very seriously” but weeding out fakes in its online App Store has been a difficult. SAN FRANCISCO — Hundreds of fake retail and product apps have popped up in Apple’s App Store in recent weeks — just in time to deceive holiday shoppers. The counterfeiters have masqueraded as retail chains like Dollar Tree and Foot Locker, big department stores like Dillard’s and Nordstrom, online product bazaars like Zappos.com and Polyvore, and luxury-goods makers like Jimmy Choo, Christian Dior and Salvatore Ferragamo. “We’re seeing a barrage of fake apps,” said Chris Mason, chief executive of Branding Brand, a Pittsburgh company that helps retailers build and maintain apps. He said his company constantly tracks new shopping apps, and this was the first time it had seen so many counterfeit iPhone apps emerge in a short period of time. Some of them appeared to be relatively harmless — essentially junk apps that served up annoying pop-up ads, he said. But there are serious risks to using a fake app. Entering credit card information opens a customer to potential financial fraud. Some fake apps contain malware that can steal personal information or even lock the phone until the user pays a ransom. And some fakes encourage users to log in using their Facebook credentials, potentially exposing sensitive personal information. The rogue apps, most of which came from developers in China, slipped through Apple’s process for reviewing every app before it is published. That scrutiny, which Apple markets as an advantage over Google’s less restrictive Android smartphone platform, is supposed to stop any software that is deceitful, that improperly uses another company’s intellectual property or that poses harm to consumers. In practice, however, Apple focuses more on blocking malicious software and does not routinely examine the thousands of apps submitted to the iTunes store every day to see if they are legitimately associated with the brand names listed on them. Faking it With apps becoming more popular as a way to shop, it is up to brands and developers themselves to watch for fakes and report them, much as they scan for fake websites, said Ben Reubenstein, chief executive of Possible Mobile, a Denver company that makes apps for JetBlue Airways, the PGA Tour and Pokemon Co., among others. “It’s important that brands monitor how their name is being used,” he said. Apple removed hundreds of fake apps Nov. 3 after The New York Times inquired about the specific app vendors that created many of them. Other apps were removed after a New York Post article drew attention to some of the counterfeits earlier this month. “We strive to offer customers the best experience possible, and we take their security very seriously,” said an Apple spokesman, Tom Neumayr. “We’ve set up ways for customers and developers to flag fraudulent or suspicious apps, which we promptly investigate to ensure the App Store is safe and secure. We’ve removed these offending apps and will continue to be vigilant about looking for apps that might put our users at risk.” In September, Apple also embarked on a campaign to review all 2 million apps in the App Store and remove “apps that no longer function as intended, don’t follow current review guidelines or are outdated.” The company says that a significant number of apps have been removed and that the review is continuing. Despite Apple’s efforts, new fake apps appear every day. In some cases, developers change the content of an app after it has been approved by Apple’s monitors. In other instances, the counterfeiters change their names and credentials, and resubmit similar apps after one round of fakes is discovered. “It’s a game of whack-a-mole,” Mason of Branding Brand said. China is by far the biggest source of fake apps, according to security experts. Many of the fake retail apps have red flags signaling that they are not real, such as nonsensical menus written in butchered English, no reviews and no history of previous versions. In one fake New Balance app, for example, the tab for phone support did not list a phone number and said, “Our angents are available over the hone Monday-Firday." Data from Apptopia show that some of the fake apps have been downloaded thousands of times, although it is unclear how many people have actually used them. Reviews posted on some of the apps indicated that at least some people tried them and became frustrated. “Would give zero stars if possible,” wrote one reviewer of the fake Dollar Tree app. “Constantly gets stuck in menus and closes what you were doing and makes you start over.” Most exposed Mason says consumers want to shop online and they search for apps from their favorite stores and brands. “The retailers who are most exposed are the ones with no app at all,” he said. Dollar Tree and Dillard’s, for example, have no official iPhone apps, which made it easier to lure their customers to the fake apps. But the counterfeiters have also mimicked companies that do have an official presence in the App Store, hoping to capitalize on consumer confusion about which ones are real. The shoe retailer Foot Locker Inc., for example, has three iPhone apps. But that did not stop an entity calling itself Footlocke Sports Co. Ltd. from offering 16 shoe and clothing apps in the App Store — including one purporting to be from a Foot Locker rival, Famous Footwear. Similarly, the supermarket chain Kroger Co. has 20 iPhone apps, reflecting the various retail chains in its empire. An entity calling itself The Kroger Inc. had 19 apps, purporting to sell things as diverse as an $80 pair of Asics sneakers and a $688 bottle of Dior perfume. Some of the fake apps have even used Apple’s new paid search ads to propel them to the top of the results screen when customers search for specific brands in the App Store. Jon Clay, director of global threat communications for Trend Micro, an internet security firm, said Apple’s tight control over the iPhone had historically kept malicious apps out of its App Store. Fake apps appeared more often on Google’s Android platform or on third-party app stores, he said. But that is beginning to change. Shortly after the Pokemon Go game was released in the United States in July, for example, a spate of fake iPhone apps related to the game appeared, especially in countries where the game was not yet available. “The criminals are going to take advantage of whatever is hot,” Clay said.

Anytime. Anywhere. NEWS OPS By Tim Bajarin. Updated November 7, 2016 9:24AM SHARE ALSO SEE Apple MacBook Pro Enterprise Hardware Intel Touch Bar Macros Computing Steve Jobs GUI macOS The first time I saw and played with the Touch Bar on the new MacBook Pros, the concept of the macros of the past popped into mind. Like many who read this column who are power users, we all know the value of creating macros and applying them to our apps to speed up a particular business process. What Apple has done through the Touch Bar is basically deliver this kind of functionality, and gives the power of macros to the masses. What Apple has done with the Touch Bar is to give the power of macros to the masses. How many of you remember the role macros played in the early days of the PC? Macros are basically shortcuts to set up an often-used spreadsheet or to add a set of database formats that would be employed for repetitive data input. These were very important during the days when Microsoft's DOS ruled the PC world. Even today, programmers use macros all the time, and power users still create macros for use in various types of apps where they are still supported. However, most users don't even know these shortcuts exists, or if they do, consider them too difficult to find and use. Then Apple introduced the Mac, with its graphical user interface. This, and the next generation of GUIs, made navigating through apps much easier. Also, these GUIs introduced an updated version of cut and paste that, in many ways, allowed a person to do similar things macros did when it came to interjecting what, in binary code, is just mathematical equations used over and over within an app of some type. Another way to look at this is to look back on Apple's influence on UIs in the past. With the Mac, Apple introduced the graphical UI and the mouse. This advanced the user interface of man-to-machine dramatically. With the iPhone and the iPad, the company introduced touch, something that is now mainstream in UIs for smartphones and tablets and even PCs and laptops. But Apple's philosophy on touch does not extend to laptops and iMacs for one key reason. Jobs always believed, right or wrong, that, when your hands were on the keyboard, the best position for input was via a keyboard and mouse. He felt that the motion to take the hand from the keyboard and move it to the screen as part of navigation was unnatural. Although adding a keyboard to the iPad breaks with this view, this is more a function of the iPad's design, and many of us who use iPads with keyboards would love a mouse to use with it. An interesting side note comes with Microsoft's Surface tablet. Most of my friends who use it with a keyboard also carry a mouse, as they don't like using their fingers because the touch input is not as precise as one can get with a mouse. The Touch Bar brings the functions of power-user macros to the general user by demystifying the concept of shortcuts for repetitive tasks, and it adds easy-to-use and fast access to all types of functions within applications that will support it. The Touch Bar is an important evolution of Apple's contribution to user interface design. It brings the functions of power-user macros to the general user by demystifying the concept of shortcuts for repetitive tasks, and it adds easy-to-use and fast access to all types of functions within applications that will support it. This is why the Touch Bar matters. Once people start using it, this will be viewed as a logical next step in UIs for laptops, and we will want this on other Apple laptops and desktops as well. This will be especially true as the software community embraces this new feature and uses Apple's APIs for the Touch Bar in their own applications. At the Apple event, the company showed us the tip of the iceberg for use on its own applications and ones from early partners like Adobe. But Microsoft plans to support the Touch Bar APIs in all of its Mac applications, and by early next year, we should see thousands of macOS apps supporting it. This gives Mac users a new way to speed up navigation and access within apps on a portable computer, and enhances the laptop experience significantly. As for the new MacBook Pro's design, I believe it will be a big hit for Apple's high-end customers, and the entry product, which still has the older function keys, will be targeted as a replacement for the MacBook Air, especially in the enterprise . I have played with this model for about four days now and can see this as a great replacement for the Air. I am concerned with the new MacBook Pros pricing, but to be fair, if this meets the needs of their pro customers, it will still sell well. However, if Apple's new Touch Bar is the next evolution of Apple's contribution to mobile user interface design, I suspect the Touch Bar will eventually be on all laptops Apple brings to market over time, and if history is our guide, the prices of these MacBook Pros will also go down in next-generation models. I realize there will be naysayers who will be skeptical about the role the Touch Bar plays in the future. But if there is one thing I have learned over the 35 years of covering Apple, it is that when Cupertino puts a lot of thought and detail into user interfaces, it is best to take note. That is why I believe the Touch Bar not only matters, but that it and the special chip Apple uses to power it will have more of an industry impact than most can see right now. © 2016 Re/Code syndicated under contract with NewsEdge.

At this point from announcement, the delay has raised concerns and requests for pre-order cancellations — and thus, Apple gets to be educated on how diminishing returns actually come about. One retail worker claimed that his store was expecting a shipment of AirPods late next week. Barclays researchers claim that it is far from the case. They note that factories won’t begin churning them out until December — late into the holiday retail rat race and certainly out of range for the typical shopping binge period of Black Friday and Cyber Monday. The first lot is estimated to range between 10 million and 15 million units. That could leave Apple catching up to demand as it has been with its iPhone 7 Plus models this year. In fact, channel inventory has proved difficult for Apple to manage — if not procure — for the past year as the company has tried to pull batch discounts and manufacturer competition to its favor in getting a good price on its components and assembly. Its failure to keep product flowing has left customers waiting for their products week after week — shipping wait times on the iPhone 7 Plus are still at three to four weeks at this stage. But who knows if exclusivity and prestige may keep Infinite Loop in consumers’ favor. And we’ll have to see if what information the investment firm has is good info.

Users are no longer required to use their Apple Watch to unlock their MacBook Pro. The same could not be said for the new iMac desktop however, and because of that somewhat surprising absence, it has suddenly become more hard to predict a possible arrival date for this particular product. MacBook Pro and Surface Studio both have spectacular and unique features and specifications and it will be hard to decide which is greater and worth buying. It will also provide support for adding emoji's easily. They have also done away with all the traditional USB ports in favor of the new USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports, and they have also killed off the SD card reader, which is actually quite a pity, and also the glowing Apple logo. Bob O'Donnell, president of TECHnalysis Research LLC, said before the Mac announcement that the market believes focus on the iPhone means Apple has "almost given up on Macs", which has led to losing market share to other personal computers. They will be available later in November, starting at C$2,299 (13 inch) and $2,999 (15 inch). Gone are the familiar function keys, replaced by Touch Bar, which you can customise according to Apple's breaking news. The 2016 MacBook Pro has a 6th-generation Intel Core i5 processor. Apple announced three new models in the Macbook Pro range yesterday and there are some interesting features seen on the newly announced devices. Even if loads of people have a Touch Bar-enabled Macbook, the firm says that developers should steer clear of duplicating functionality already available as a keyboard shortcut (e.g. copy, paste, page up, page down). According to Engadget, the iPad Air's future doesn't seem promising, especially now that the Apple has a new line of tablets, the iPad Pro. Both the Macs will come with four Thunderbolt 3 ports and any of them can be plugged in as Power, Thunderbolt, USB, HDMI and much more. The touch bar will adapt to the program now being used, provided it supports this feature. In the performance segment, the new 15-inch MacBook Pro will feature a quad-core Core i7 processor, AMD Radeon Pro graphics with up to 4GB of video memory, and up to 16 GB of RAM. A second-generation Touch ID sensor covered with a sapphire crystal has been included to the right of the Touch Bar on the new MacBook Pro. The new MacBook, which has three models, also gets support for Touch ID as well as Force Touch technology, among other goodies. 12 November 2016 Clinton tells supporters to greet Trump with 'open mind' 12 November 2016 Parrikar's opinion on nuclear doctrine stirs political debate 12 November 2016 Jrue Holiday to return to Pelicans 12 November 2016 Jose Mourinho could face another FA charge after Burnley incident 12 November 2016 Bucks serve as gracious hosts, fall to Pelicans (AUDIO) 12 November 2016 Blac Chyna Does The Mannequin Challenge Hours After Giving Birth 12 November 2016 Give Trump a chance to lead: Clinton 12 November 2016 Wayne Rooney return to Everton would please Ronald Koeman 12 November 2016 President Obama Delivers Remarks On Trump Victory, Clinton Loss 12 November 2016 Blue Jays reportedly sign free agent Morales 12 November 2016 How NRIs can change their rupees 12 November 2016 Halya Coynash: Make Russia's open interference a Pyrrhic Putin - Trump victory Most Read Most Commented Melania Trump, Michelle Obama tete-a-tete over tea at White House The president-elect said he is very much "looking forward" to his predecessor's counsel when he takes office.

Here are some of the discounts from Target, Best Buy, and Walmart on Black Friday. Buy if you're in the market on Black Friday for an Apple iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus then wait no longer. iPhone 7's successor may come with a wireless charging feature. The Apple Black Friday Deals at this store will also reduce the price of iPad Air 2 models by $125. Originally unveiled in Apple's 9.7-inch iPad Pro, the display uses four-channel ambient light sensors to detect the light signature of the room before adjusting screen brightness accordingly. Apple will launch a trio of new iPad Pro models in March, including refreshed 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch versions and an all-new bezel-free 10.9-inch model, according to Barclays Research analysts Blayne Curtis, Christopher Hemmelgarn, Thomas O'Malley, and Jerry Zhang, citing sources within the company's Asian supply chain. Prices for these times while the Apple Black Friday Deals is in effect will range from $900 to $1,599.99. Good thing that this 9.7-inch model will be $150 less during the Black Friday. This is more than Best Buy and Target are taking off the regular iPad Pro price. The iPhone 8 series would be the same size as the existing models - but thanks to the bezel-less design, the phones could feature larger displays. In what's become something of a tradition, many retailers have started publishing their Black Friday deals weeks in advance, presumably so that shoppers can take stock of what's available and plan accordingly. 12 November 2016 Enjoy the Iron Man Experience in Hong Kong Disneyland 12 November 2016 Can Electors Make Hillary Clinton President On Dec. 19? 12 November 2016 AT&T Debuts 'Stream Saver', Will Downgrade Video Quality 12 November 2016 Chargers stadium vote fails, opens door for move to Los Angeles Russia Says It Was In Touch With Trump Campaign During The Election 12 November 2016 Bella Hadid & The Weeknd Have Reportedly Split JK Rowling hopes Potter fans embrace 'Fantastic Beasts' movie 12 November 2016 Deposits above Rs 2.5 lakh to face tax, 200% penalty on mismatch 12 November 2016 India, Japan should march forward to explore bigger potentials: Modi Trump, Clinton split early votes in tiny New Hampshire towns 12 November 2016 Well-preserved bird-like dinosaur discovered in China 12 November 2016 Kohl's tops earnings forecasts on lower costs Most Read Most Commented Michigan, Flint Ordered To Make Home Water Deliveries State lawyers were reviewing Mr Lawson's order, said Anna Heaton, spokeswoman for Governor Rick Snyder.

But, if the rumors prove true in the next few months, the 2017 MacBook Air will be much more than just an alternate. Credit:Stephen Lam/Getty Images On October 27, when Apple officially unveiled the 2016 MacBook Pro, there was no news about the next generation of the MacBook Air. And while the new device is lighter and thinner than its predecessors, there was still a gap left for an entry-level notebook from the Cupertino-based company. If the rumors are anything to go by, however, this whole will soon be filled. The 2016 MacBook Pro, which has started shipping out, is a spectacular piece of technology. As Apple Insider notes, the 15-inch model, which automatically comes with the innovative Touch Bar, is able to smoothly edit 5K ProRes footage on Final Cut Pro X. The publication even goes as far as to state that the new unit runs faster than its Windows counterparts, which boast superior specifications. The previously mentioned Touch Bar provides users with quick access to various features and shortcuts that are specific to the opened application. The entire feature supposedly makes the experience of using the 2016 MacBook Pro more efficient and enjoyable. Users, essentially, have quick access to various commands because of this addition. The publication then went on to note that while having to get used to the USB Type C or Thunderbolt 3 ports might take some getting used to, it will undoubtedly be a non-issue after some months of use. This is true for most of Apple's products, which have often times pushed the limits of how technology is viewed and used by the general public. It is understandable how the 2016 MacBook Pro is no exception. Even before the 2016 MacBook Pro was officially made public, there was speculation that Apple would discontinue its line of MacBook Air units. The reasoning was that the new Pro would be lighter and thinner than any other product that the Cupertino-based company had released. And while the idea was an exciting one, there were still a group of Apple enthusiasts that were crushed at the thought. As International Business Times AU notes, Apple will likely release another MacBook Air unit before discontinuing the line altogether. Therefore, some sources have picked up on the hint of a 2017 MacBook Air device. And while the 2016 MacBook Pro is thinner and lighter than anything before it, the new Air will stick to its definition and will be even more lightweight. In addition to the slight design changes, the publication goes to say that the 2017 MacBook Air will also come with its own features, which will surely set it apart from its competition, as well as the rest of the Mac product line. Reportedly, the unit will sport an E-ink keyboard made by Sonder Design. The company has made a name for itself in creating this type of keyboard. The E-Ink Keyboard will work like the current Touch Bar on the 2016 MacBook Pro. For each application that the user opens, the entire keyboard should alter its dynamic. Whether this is in terms of language or features itself, however, is unclear. Furthermore, the 2017 MacBook Air will also reportedly no longer carry the standard USB Type A ports. Instead, the notebook is expected to arrive sporting the more modern USB Type-C ports. Unfortunately, not much else is known about the upcoming unit. It would, however, be a welcome announcement if Apple were to confirm that the 2017 MacBook Air will arrive with at least the Kaby Lake processor, as well as Touch ID support and a trackpad that can be used with the Apple Pencil.

By Feliciano Rodriguez III Posted on November 12, 2016 Share Tweet Share Share Email Get ready for another Macbook Pro 2016 alternative. This time we do a smackdown between age old rivals Apple and Microsoft. In this article, we’ll compare the new and much criticized 13-inch Macbook Pro with the Surface Book. Both of the laptops are targeted at the professional users. How will they compare with each other? Which of them is the more Pro laptop? Let’s find out.

Again, comparing the new 13-inch Macbook to its Windows competitors expose the glaring outdatedness of its 6th Generation Skylake processors. Tech commentators and Apple fans can’t comprehend why Apple chose to use a one generation old processor for its 2016 Macbook Pros. The Surface Book’s 6th Generation Skylake processor is still quick and battery efficient, even one year after its release. The Surface Book can still duke it out against newer Windows laptops like the updated Dell XPS 13, which now has the newer Intel Kaby Lake processors. Both Laptops feature a generous 8GB RAM and both have gorgeous high definition displays. Check out Microsoft’s official website for a more in-depth look the Surface Book. The Surface Book has more input output options though, compared to the Macbook Pros paltry two USB type C ports. Both laptops weigh in at around 1.4kgs, and both have great build quality. The Macbook Pro has Apple’s trademark aluminum unibody design and the Surface Book is made of two magnesium blocks. The two devices look and feel premium. The Surface Book is about $200 more expensive than the base 13-inch Macbook Pro, however, the Surface Book has a touchscreen display, and is compatible with Microsoft’s excellent proprietary Surface Pen. The Surface Book also has a unique hinge wherein the display can disconnect, transforming the Surface Book into a stand alone full tablet. The Macbook Pro cannot trump this unique feature; It doesn’t even have touch screen. Conclusion If you are fully committed or invested in the macOS ecosystem, then you have no choice but to buy the new 13-inch Macbook Pro, or wait for its more advanced brothers with the much touted OLED Touch Bars. However, if you want a unique laptop with great specs, that also transforms into a tablet, then you can’t go wrong with Microsoft’s Surface Book laptop.

More than just technology news Home Tech Reviews Science Games Culture Video Stay Connected Facebook Twitter RSS Updated Hot Tags Pokemon Go Apple Pokemon Go Update Science Donald Trump Is Apple Working On A New Display Technology For The New iPhone, iPad? Jiran First Posted: Nov 12, 2016 04:32 AM EST After releasing its iPhone 8 and MacBook Pro this year, Apple is rumored to be launching a bezel-less design for the new iPhone and iPad. (iPhoneDigital / Flickr) Both the new iPhone and iPad are reported to be integrated with the new display technology. Specifically, it is possible that both upcoming devices of Apple will feature a bezel-less design. This is among the other major changes that the tech company will do. A Larger Screen For iPhone 8 According to the Fortune, Barclays analysts Blayne Curtis and Christopher Hemmelgarn suggested that the iPhone 8 will have a larger screen than the iPhone 7. Business Insider reported that the iPhone 8 will offer a 5-inch screen. The iPhone 8 Plus will have a 5.8-inch display. This is a bit larger than the 4.7-inch iPhone 7 and 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus. The change of the screen size may have something to do with the rumored bezel-less design of the iPhone 8. The obvious difference would be the curved display of the left and right side of the screen. For comparison, it is akin to the edges of the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. This can be achieved if Apple will use the organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screen technology. Other smartphones already use this particular technology. But it would just be the first time for the tech giant if this pushes through for iPhone 8. Analysts added that the plastic OLED screen will allow a curved bezel-less edge. Apple is yet to confirm this. The New Apple iPad Apple has already announced the release of its new tablets in March. According to the Digital Trends, there might be an iPad with a bezel-free 10.9-inch design. Though the screen size may be larger, the device will have the same physical size as the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. Like in the case of the iPhone 8, such display indicates that it will be the end for the Home button. That is at the cost of having an edge-to-edge design. Apple has been tight-lipped with details about its new devices.

Tuesday November 15, 2016 US WORLD PERSECUTION MINISTRY CULTURE VIDEO Subscriptions Homepage US iPhone 8 release date, news details, specs, price rumors: Apple to work with Sharp and Energous to ensure new features Gracezyl Blanco 12 November, 2016 12:42 PM Like Us Share on Facebook Share on Twitter (Reuters/Beck Diefenbach)iPhone 7's successor may come with a wireless charging feature. Months after Apple released its new 2016 phones — iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus during the Apple Event in September, many fans of the company are already eager for the next generation of iPhones, the iPhone 8, which is expected to sport game-changing features in the smartphone industry. The iPhone 8 is expected to be unveiled at the next Apple launching event in 2017, and since it is also Apple's 20th anniversary next year, many are expecting that it will sport a breakthrough organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screen. It is speculated that Apple will also work with Sharp to come up with new iPhone 8 screens. Aside from that, the new iPhone 8 screen is speculated to have an in-built home button, and will feature a curved display. The upcoming phone is also speculated to have a glass-cased front and back cover. Moreover, Apple is also speculated to add a wireless charging ability for the iPhone 8. As to how this will work, details state that a new system will allow users to charge the iPhone for at least 15 feet away from its dock. It is further speculated that the company will work with Energous on this. In addition, the upcoming phone is said to carry additional security measures that includes an iris scanner and a face-detection system, and it will be powered by an A11 processor chip. Finally, the iPhone 8's speculated price is set at around $600 upon release or around £540 in the United Kingdom. Many fans and Apple aficionados were disappointed that Apple failed to equip the iPhone 7 with new, game-changing features which is usually the company's edge when it comes to the smartphone industry. Many however hoped that the company will be able to pull it off next year with the iPhone 8's launch.

Tags : Apple-Apple+ Apple has published its 2016 Holiday Gift Guide, a focused view of its own products that the company strongly recommends, and while there are no deals or price cuts here, fans of the Apple brand will find it worth taking a quick look at the lineup. After all, an endorsement of a product in the Holiday Gift guide is a strong statement for tight-lipped Apple and it suggests that the products mentioned are of truly outstanding quality and value. Of course, you have the staple products front and center: Apple's Holiday Gift guide shows that some of the best Holiday gifts would be an iPhone 7, a new Apple Watch, the iPad Pro, Macbook, and Apple TV, but along them comes an interesting selection of accessories, as well as separate sections with gifts for music enthusiasts, photography lovers, and games and toys. The cute BB-8 droid is one neat gift ideaThere is a particularly curious selection of products not made by Apple that still made it into the 2016 Holiday Gift guide: the neat Roli Blocks music making solution with its colorful interface and novel way of making beats, as well as the Sonos:Play1 wireless speakers with great quality are prominently featured in the music section. For photography enthusiasts, Apple recommends the extremely tiny and foldable DJI Mavic Pro drone that also features fast speed, as well as some neat following features, as well as the DJI Osmo Mobile gimbal that is great at stablizing your iPhone videos. If you shoot video in the dark, Apple recommends the Manfrotto Lumimuse 3 LED lights system, while vloggers will probably appreciate Apple's recommendation for the Manfrotto Twistgrip universal smartphone mount accessory. Our favorite section, however, is the toys and games, where you find recommendations for the cool Ubtech Jimu Robot Meebot Kit, as well as the cute Anki Cozmo Robot with Power Cubes.  You can find out more cool ideas for Holiday gifts in Apple's 2016 guide right below: 2016 Holiday Gift guide:  Devices | Music | Photography | Toys and Games 2016 Apple Holiday Gift Guide Popular galleries Sprint has Verizon executives sweating and trembling with fear according to its new ads The upcoming OnePlus 3T: 5 expected new features that will set it apart from the regular OnePlus 3 Best smartphones you can buy right now: (October-November 2016) Xiaomi Mi MIX official: 6.4-inch ceramic monster with high-end specs and a 91.3% screen-to-body ratio LG V20 review: 10 key takeaways iPhone 7 catches fire, burns a car Time to look for alternatives: get the Galaxy Note 7's features on the Note 5 with these tips!

Tuesday November 15, 2016 US WORLD PERSECUTION MINISTRY CULTURE VIDEO Subscriptions Homepage CULTURE iPhone 8 release date, news, specs rumors: Curved screen, wireless charging and all other premium features expected Catherine Salvador 11 November, 2016 11:29 PM Like Us Share on Facebook Share on Twitter (Reuters/Beck Diefenbach)iPhone 7's successor may come with a wireless charging feature. iPhone 7 has just been released but Apple enthusiasts are already looking forward to the upcoming flagship phone, the iPhone 8. It has been rumored that Apple is preparing something grand for the upcoming handset as it will be launched in celebration with the 10th anniversary of the initial iPhone model. There are rumors stating that Apple will ditch the iPhone number labels and just release the upcoming flagship as iPhone Pro or The iPhone. However, for the sake of avoiding confusion, enthusiasts continue to call it iPhone 8. In an article by The Wall Street Journal, the Cupertino-based tech giant is planning a grand 2017 with major changes. These changes may possibly be the long-standing rumor about the organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screen and the ditching of the home button by creating a fingerprint sensor. One of Apple's China-based engineers were previously asked why the current model has no major design change and one of them revealed that a "new technology" is on the way and will take some time to be released. Furthermore, iPhone 8 is expected to have a curved screen, which is not seen in the current model as the device is not yet ready to be applied with such technology. In an article by PC Advisor, iPhone 8 will be able to get charged without having to be connected through a wire. However, this has yet to be confirmed. As for the release date, it is still early to speculate. However, enthusiasts believe that 2017 is the year of iPhone 8. Three models may come out, according to Nikkei. These are the 4.7-inch model, 5.5-inch model and the "Pro" model with a 5.5-inch curved screen. Also, since Apple has a release pattern of launching handsets and if assumed to be unchanged, iPhone 7s may also be released in 2017, after the iPhone 7's launch date. Apple apparently has to plan something grand to celebrate the event so an "S" model is highly possible.

First Posted: Nov 12, 2016 04:18 AM EST Apple might actually refresh its iPad line next year. (The Verge / YouTube) Apple may have skipped the iPads during their September and November events but it looks like the company will finally freshen up its tablet line next year. Barclays analysts say that Apple will once again refresh their iPad series in 2017. In fact, three new tablets might come out of Apple's doors in a few months' time. One of which is a low-cost version of the iPad Pro 9.7. Apple iPads 2017 According to GSM Arena, Apple will release refreshed versions of the iPad Pro 9.7 and 12.9 inch. There will also be a device similar to the iPad Air 2 but with no bezels. As for the lower-cost version of the iPad Pro 9.7, it was said that there is a good chance that this iPad will no longer be called "Pro". This, of course, is due to the fact that it would be low cost. Phone Arena says that this iPad will have entry-level specs. Apple iPads 2017 Release There is still no clarity as to when Apple will be releasing the new iPads. However, a March 2017 launch isn't exactly off the table considering the March release of the iPad Pro 9.7. Hopefully, Apple does release the new iPads as early as March so as to avoid making the iPad line a little too outdated. The affordable variant and the bezel-less variant are both welcome additions to Apple's iPad line. This new report, of course, also triggers the rumor that the iPhone 8 2017 could also come with a bezel-less screen. This couldn't be impossible considering the rumors that the next iPhone will have glass exteriors. Needless to say, whatever Apple has planned for its devices next year, it's almost certain that they will hype the Apple fan base once again. It's safe to say that 2017 should be a busy year for Apple not only because of the iPad refresh but also for the anniversary iPhone release.

Tech experts have been reporting that Apple’s new tablet is only months away from being launched. Launch Date The most opportune time for Apple to unveil their new tablet was in October, but Apple chose to release their new MacBook instead. Speculations are pointing out the fact that it might be too late now for the tablet to be launched during 2016, and we can expect it to drop around March 2017. There are some rumors saying that Apple is going to release the tablet in two variants, the 10.5 inch variant and the more affordable 9.7 inch one. Model Name Apple is not keeping their tradition of naming each different version of a product differently, instead of naming the new tablet the iPad Pro 2 they are going to simply name it the iPad Pro. They made the same decision with the iPad Pro versions. Apple Pencil One of the selling points in the iPad Pro series is the Apple Pencil. The device is a pressure sensitive pen that the user can use to take notes or to draw on the tablet. New feature might be implemented in the new iPad pro, and users might be able to send hand written emails, or even draw on web pages. A feature that was inspired from what Microsoft has done with their own pen. Hardware Apple is supposedly going to upgrade the tablet’s camera department and equip it with a 12MP primary camera and a 5MP secondary one. The display is going to see some improvements as well, receiving the True Tone feature. Apple has just introduced the A10 Fusion processor in their iPhone 7 line of devices, and they are expected to install it in the iPad Pro as well. The processor is going to be a great addition to the tablet, it will improve its performance and at the same time its battery life.

By Ritesh Bendre | Published: November 12, 2016 6:46 PM IST Email @GadgetFreak4U comments Tags: Apple News Apple will be celebrating the 10th anniversary of iPhone next year, and it is reportedly planning to launch the next iPhone in three sizes – 4.7-inch, 5-inch and 5.5-inch. However, the next iPhones may not be the only star products as Apple also seems to be gearing up to launch as many as three iPads in March next year. Citing Barclays analysts, Apple Insider reports that the next year’s iPad lineup will include a 9.7-inch and a 12.9-inch iPad Pro model, along with a bezel-less 10.9-inch iPad. All of these iPads will be launched at Apple’s March 2017 event. The report also states that the new 10.9-inch iPad will come in the same enclosure as the existing 9.7-inch iPad Pro, but will omit the side bezels. Barclays also claim that despite carrying the ‘pro’ nomenclature, the 9.7-inch iPad Pro will be a low-cost iPad, and not a premium model. This also means that we may not see the refreshed iPad mini model, at least in early 2017. While details about the specifications and features of the upcoming iPad lineup are unknown, a recent report from KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo did hint at some changes. He mentioned that the next-gen iPads will be powered by Apple’s A10X chipsets made by TSMC and built on 10nm fabrication process. He had also mentioned about ‘revolutionary’ changes to the iPad’s design in 2018, but with the current report of iPad with bezel-less display, it seems like Apple may not wait for another year. ALSO READ: Apple iPad price in India slashed by up to Rs 10,000, storage bumped Based on the reports that we have come across, Apple is likely to ditch the iPhone 7s next year, and would directly release the iPhone 8. Rumors also state that it will come with an edge-to-edge AMOLED display, while eliminating the home button (with Touch ID fingerprint sensor) altogether. With Apple launching the bezel-less iPad in early 2017, it would also offer a sneak peek at how Apple’s iPhone 8 with edge-to-edge display would look like. ALSO READ: Apple iPhone 8 could boast truly wireless charging capabilities Talking about the next-gen iPhone, we recently came across mockups made by Latvian graphic designer and YouTuber Veniamin Geskin, offering us a glimpse at how the iPhone 8 may look like. Apple is expected to give the required resolution bump to the next-gen iPhones – with the 4.7-inch model sporting a full HD panel, whereas the 5.5-inch model finally switching to a QHD (2K) display, just like its competitors. However, details about the display resolution of the 5-inch iPhone aren’t known yet. ALSO READ: Apple patents new technology that will find your lost iPhone even when switched off The new iPhones may also boast a glass back made by Lens Technology and Biel Crystal Manufactory, both factories based in China. The iPhone 4s released back in 2011 was the last Apple device to come with a glass back, after which the company opted for metal housing. The new iPhones may also come with ‘long-distance charging’ technology that will allow users to charge the iPhone from a distance of up to 15 meters. Right now, all these are rumors and leaked reports based on supply chain, but we will have to wait until Apple officially announces these products to see what all features finally make to the devices. ALSO READ: Apple iPhone 8 could come in three sizes and this is how the lineup may look like Mars surface too dry to be habitable: Scientists Gionee S9 teaser reveals front-facing flash, live photos leak too Published: November 12, 2016 6:46 PM IST | Updated: November 12, 2016 6:46 PM IST Mashable Tech Facebook is finally taking a step to combat fake news Tinder launches new trans-inclusive gender options New customizeable book helps girls smash tech stereotypes This book is the perfect gift for every Apple fanboy and fangirl Trending How to watch OnePlus 3T launch live stream at 11:30PM IST Xiaomi Mi Box 4th generation Android set-top box to launch tomorrow; here’s everything we know so far Vivo V5 hands-on and first impressions Gionee S9 with dual-rear camera, 5.5-inch full HD display launched: Price, specifications and features Huawei turned down opportunity to manufacture Google Pixel smartphones; here’s why Related Articles Apple Pay now supports instant donations to non-profit organizations Samsung Galaxy S8 to take on Apple iPhones with new pressure-sensitive display technology: Report Apple working on Google-like augmented reality glasses iPad games are effective in treating amblyopia in children: Study Here’s how the Silicon Valley reacted to Donald Trump being elected as the 45th US President News Online harassment in India lacks awareness, strict laws: Report Reliance Group partners Cisco Jasper for its IoT venture ‘UNLIMIT’ How to watch OnePlus 3T launch live stream at 11:30PM IST Xiaomi Mi Box 4th generation Android set-top box to launch tomorrow; here’s everything we know so far Meizu Pro 7 with 5.62-inch Super AMOLED ‘bezel-less’ display and Kirin 960 SoC leaks online Newsletter Email address: Previous ArticlePreviousGionee S9 teaser reveals front-facing flash, live photos leak too Next ArticleNextMars surface too dry to be habitable: Scientists FOLLOW BGR Like BGR on Facebook Follow @BGR on Twitter BGR on Google Plus Follow BGR on LinkedIn Download BGR App from Play store BGR ON TWITTER BGR India @bgrindia 1h Online harassment in India lacks awareness, strict laws: Report bgr.in/news/online-ha… BGR India @bgrindia 2h Reliance Group partners Cisco Jasper for its IoT venture ‘UNLIMIT’ bgr.in/news/reliance-… BGR India @bgrindia 3h How to watch OnePlus 3T launch live stream at 11:30PM IST bgr.in/news/how-to-wa… About Privacy Policy Contact Us Apple Android BlackBerry Business Exclusives Mobile Reviews Copyright 2016 BGR Media, LLC × Tip Us

Apple‘s last tablet releases included the debut of the large 12.9-inch iPad Pro, followed by a more the more reasonably sized iPad Pro in the 9.7-inch form-factor. But now rumors are buzzing that next year will see refreshed iPad Pros in both those previous sizes, along with a brand-new 10.9-inch model featuring a bezel-free design. This latest information comes from Barclays analysts, which source Apple’s supply chain in Asia. They predict Apple to announce the trio of new iPads at a media event sometime in March. While the release of 12.9-inch and 9.7-inch iPads updated with Apple’s latest processors at some point is obvious, it’s the new 10.9-inch model that’s most interesting. The analysts note that the tablet will eliminate the borders that usually surround the screen, making it an edge-to-edge display. Because of this, the new model will be able to maintain the same physical size as the existing 9.7-inch iPad Pro. iPad Pro 9.7 Review: the laptop killer The remainder of Barclays’ prediction is that Apple will sell the three larger iPad models alongside each other, with the 9.7-inch model becoming the “low-cost” option, despite maintaining the “Pro” name. The 7.9-inch iPad Mini isn’t expected to be refreshed anytime soon, but the existing model, first released in September 2015, will continue to be manufactured and sold. There have been rumors about 10.1 to 10.5-inch iPad for several months now, and reports about next year’s iPhone featuring a bezel-free design for much longer than that. It could be that Apple has been considering a brand-new iPad size/design for some time, and has decided to use it to unveil an edge-to-edge display ahead of the next iPhone.

The company may be planning on releasing a trio of new iPads in March, including one device with a bezel-free 10.9-inch design. According to reports, the bezel-less design will allow the device to have the same physical size as the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, while offering a larger display. That could also signal the removal of the Home button and an edge-to-edge design on the device. The news comes from a research note obtained by MacRumors from Barclays Research analysts Blayne Curtis, Christopher Hemmelgarn, Thomas O’Malley, and Jerry Zhang. More: Great deal! Apple slashes the price of refurbished iPads This isn’t the first time we’ve heard news that Apple was developing an iPad in the 10-inch size range, however we haven’t really heard what the exact screen size would be until now. On top of the new bezel-less iPad, analysts also expect Apple to release a new 9.7-inch low-cost iPad Pro, which will be sold alongside the iPad Mini. Analysts don’t expect the iPad Mini to get an update — instead, Apple will continue selling the iPad Mini 4, which was released by Apple in September 2015. It’s also said that the 12.9-inch iPad Pro will receive its own update. Some expect the device to get a True Tone display, like the smaller 9.7-inch device. That display uses a series of ambient light sensors to change the color of the display depending on the color and intensity of the light that is surrounding the iPad, ensuring that it always appears to look natural. The 12.9-inch iPad Pro will also apparently get the 12MP rear-facing camera from the 9.7-inch device. All three of the new iPad models will reportedly get quad microphones, and will keep the headphone jack, unlike the new iPhone 7.

Tags : iOS-iOS+ Apple-Apple+ Apps-Apps+ Apple is rolling out a tech support app in the App StoreNot everyone knows how to use the Apple iPhone in their hand. That is why Apple has launched the new Apple Support app that is now rolling out to the App Store. The app provides tips to iPhone users, including information about different iPhone models, and will even help get you an appointment at the Apple Store for an iPhone repair. Heck, it will even schedule an appointment with an authorized third party repair shop. With the Support app, you can chat, email or speak with an Apple Support technician. The app will know all of the Apple products you have registered, so if you know your phone only as an iPhone, the app will tell you whether it is an Apple iPhone 6 or an Apple iPhone 6s. The app's home screen will list your Apple produced devices, along with links to certain articles that explain how certain features work on your Apple product. So far, the Support app is not yet available in the U.S. App Store. It is available in the Netherlands, and clicking on the sourcelink will take you to the app's preview page. While we don't know when this will be offered in the states, the app will surely come in handy after the holidays when a number of rookie iPhone owners will need help in learning how to use their new handset. source: AppleSupport via TechCrunch Share Tweet Share Bravely Default: Fairy's Effect coming to smartphones in 2017 12 Nov Prev news Facebook testing chat rooms feature for Messenger 12 Nov Next news Close newer posts Vivo V5 specs leak; both V5 and V5 Plus to feature 20MP selfie snapper 13 Nov Previously leaked bordlerless Meizu phone could be the Pro 7 12 Nov Buy the cloud-centric Nextbit Robin for just $169.99 from Amazon 12 Nov Facebook testing chat rooms feature for Messenger 12 Nov Now reading: Apple Support app starts rolling out to the App Store Apple Support app starts rolling out to the App Store 12 Nov Bravely Default: Fairy's Effect coming to smartphones in 2017 12 Nov Huawei P10 specs revealed by a GFXBench benchmark test? 12 Nov Dell Stack Windows 10 phablet looks gorgeous in leaked render 12 Nov T-Mobile soon to launch the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge in Blue Coral? 12 Nov Microsoft's canceled Nokia Moonraker smartwatch shown in hands-on video 12 Nov older posts Featured stories   Samsung Galaxy S8/S8 edge a.k.a.

I use both iPhone & Samsung. If Apple doesn't give info to authorities on the terrorists I'll only be using Samsung until they give info. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 19, 2016 The tweet was almost a warning to Silicon Valley. And, now that Trump is going to be the next president, the whole of the IT industry is very cautious, including the Indian IT sector. Apple is one company that has faced Trump's ire many times. After Trump won the election, CEO Tim Cook sent a letter to the team in which he talked about diversity, quoting Martin Luther King Jr. Team, I've heard from many of you today about the presidential election. In a political contest where the candidates were so different and each received a similar number of popular votes, it's inevitable that the aftermath leaves many of you with strong feelings. We have a very diverse team of employees, including supporters of each of the candidates. Regardless of which candidate each of us supported as individuals, the only way to move forward is to move forward together. I recall something Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said 50 years ago: "If you can't fly, then run. If you can't run, then walk. If you can't walk, then crawl, but whatever you do you have to keep moving forward." This advice is timeless, and a reminder that we only do great work and improve the world by moving forward. On the other hand, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's message was focused on securing the future for the next generation by tackling disease, improving education, connecting everyone and promoting equal opportunity. As it happens, Peter Theil who is on the Facebook board has been a staunch Trump supporter and has even funded his campaign. He is even rumored to be chairing Trump's transition committee. Meanwhile, reports suggest that Facebook news feed played a part in Trump's win even though Zuckerberg is downplaying it. Google's Indian-born CEO Sundar Pichai wrote a robust post that emphasized the role of immigrants in the US and exhorted support for the Muslim community. It also appealed to the people to not be dictated by fear. One part of the post said: My experience is obviously not unique. It's been said a million times that America is the "land of opportunity" — for millions of immigrants, it's not an abstract notion, but a concrete description of what we find here. America provided access to opportunities that simply didn't exist for many of us before we arrived. And it's not just about opportunity. The open-mindedness, tolerance, and acceptance of new Americans is one of the country's greatest strengths and most defining characteristics. And that is no coincidence — America, after all, was and is a country of immigrants. Let's not let fear defeat our values. We must support Muslim and other minority communities in the US and around the world. Another Indian-born CEO, Microsoft's Satya Nadella, said,"Yesterday we witnessed the democratic process in action here in the US. The results are of importance around the world, and I know that interest is shared among Microsoft employees. We congratulate the president-elect, and look forward to working with all those elected yesterday. Our commitment to our mission and values are steadfast, and in particular fostering a diverse and inclusive culture. With that in mind and looking to the future." Some of the other Silicon Valley figures did not hold back, though. I am not moving to Canada, not surprised by white supremacists & misogynists, and not afraid of Donald Trump. We have got to get to work. — Anil Dash (@anildash) November 9, 2016 Congratulations to @realDonaldTrump. I for one give him my most open mind and wish him great success in his service to the country. — Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) November 10, 2016 We are one country, and we have one goal: provide for the common good. We must question anything that gets in the way of that. — 🚶🏽jack (@jack) November 10, 2016 Back home, the general mood among Indian IT leaders was more openly positive than their US counterparts. "On the campaign trail, statements are not based on calculated assessments, on what is possible or what the impact will be. You could say you will eliminate H-1B visas, build a wall. But practically, you have to see what you can do to boost the economy, create jobs," NASSCOM's president R Chandrashekhar told the Economic Times. "I personally welcome Donald Trump as the president of USA. He is the voice of the people. He is a creator vs professional politician. Second, during Republicans, India was given access to elite nuclear club when George Bush was president. My take is that economic, social and defense-related ties between India and USA will increase during Mr Trump's tenure. Also, he is just straight forward human being with all emotions ranging from love to anger vs. a seasoned professional politician with controlled temperament," Mr Sandeep Aggarwal, Founder, ShopClues & Droom said in a statement. The IT industry sounds cautious in the wake of Trump's victory, as what it fears most, just like any other business, is uncertainty.

Argyll Free Press Growing News Network Tuesday, November 15, 2016 Log in Business Finance Sports Tech & Science Travel Headlines Health United States Apple Launched iBooks StoryTime for Children November 12, 2016 By Deborah Campbell Leave a Comment Apple TV has a new reading app for kids available called iBooks StoryTime. Apple on Thursday has launched a new Apple TV application called iBooks StoryTime. It brings children’s books to the big screen. Kids can go through the pages of various books on their own, or even switch on Read-Aloud narration. The feature will sync the audio to the on-screen text and change pages for you. The app is free to download and works on the 4th generation Apple TV devices that have access to tvOS App Store. However, the books are not free. There’s a giveaway at launch so you can test the app and its functions. The available content is a Read-Aloud book titled Dora’s Big Buddy Race Read-Along. A wide variety of books are available to purchase from the StoryTime app itself, as well as on the iBookstore on Mac, iPad, and iPhone. All compatible content that has been purchased previously will be available in the iBooks StoryTime. Despite the app’s great functionality for kids, it does not have a lot of supported titles at the moment. The available books include certain classic titles like “The Little Red Hen,” “Goodnight Moon,” and “Green Eggs and Ham,” and more. Several popular characters such as Grover, Sophia the First and Cookie Monster are also present in various titles, among others. In case you’re wondering if the content is appropriate for the age of your child, then it’s important to know that the app is aimed at preschoolers that have started to learn how to read. The app deviates from the standard reading apps currently available on mobile and tablets by using the Apple TV. It offers a great balance and educational experience to the hours spent by kids in front of the TV for entertainment purposes. Reading apps can be useful but also inefficient in captivating a child’s attention. The digital medium allows them to easily switch to other, more entertaining apps. This is one reason why physical books for children won’t be replaced anytime soon. Other companies have also started to thinking about more innovative ways to attract and maintain a child’s attention. Amazon’s Rapids reading app builds on how already kids use messaging apps to chat with their friends and family. As such, it uses an interactive messaging-like interface to tell a story.

Bio Latest Posts Deborah Campbell Deborah Campbell grew up on a steady diet of fantasy stories, 19th century poetry and Greek mythology. It’s no wonder she turned into such a hopeless romantic. She has always had a knack for writing, but she has yet to publish any best-seller yet. At the beginning of 2013 she decided to try something a little different: she started working for a web design firm, as a creative artist. That’s where she discovered her second calling. Although seemingly opposite, fantasy and technology are Deborah’s two main passions. She is now part of the argyllfreepress.com team, for which she creates detailed tutorials & reviews for some of the world’s most exciting gadgets. She also tries to squeeze a verse or two in her reviews from time to time.

Well, if you are a frequent visitor to the Apple store, then this new app that the company is now launching will be a life saver for you. Yes, this is none other than a dedicated Apple support app for iOS which you can install on your iPhones, iPads, and iPods. But it’s not here yet. First of all, let’s just see what this application is capable of doing. The Apple Support App requires iOS 9.0 or later and it will allow users to quickly go through some troubleshooting articles for your preferred device or allow you chat with a technician from within the app or maybe if you have an issue which cannot be resolved via the app itself, then it can also schedule an appointment with a nearby Apple Store or Apple-sanctioned service provider. This application is personalized to each and every individual user and it will know all the Apple hardware that you have registered with your account. Hence don’t worry if you don’t know which model of MacBook you own or which iPhone you are using. It will show you the content only for your devices based on the data it collected. And as far as the interface is concerned, there also you won’t have any issue since it looks like it has an easy to use interface. On the home screen, all your products are listed and according to the same, all the relevant articles will also show up for your needs. Well, if you have been following the news, then by now you already know that the recently launched Pixel smartphones from Google come with a 24*7 online support system. And interestingly, you don’t have to go anywhere to solve your issues. All you have to do is, go the support option and select the type of support you want and you are good to go. It is definitely something new and interesting to have on board and gives a sense of confidence while using the device since you know that there is a support team out there. And now talking about the Apple Support App again, as mentioned earlier, there is a catch to this and you cannot start using this just yet. As of now at the time of writing this article, the application is only showing up in the Netherlands App Store. We have no confirmation as to when should we be expecting this app to hit our app stores and other different regions. However, it is good to know that they are working on something like this to ease out the efforts. You can check out the Support App here and if you own and an iOS device outside Netherlands, then keep checking your app store as it might be launched anytime. Stay tuned.

Now, it seems like Apple is following suit — at least a little. The company has quietly launched a support app on the App Store. The app represents a slightly less hands-on approach from Apple, which has traditionally offered more personal support through avenues like the Apple Store. Clearly, the goal here is to help people quickly and easily without them having to come into the Apple Store every time something goes wrong. More: Apple seemingly getting some 2016 MacBook Pro orders ready for shipment The app basically includes help articles for popular topics, and it actually doesn’t stop at the iPhone — users can get help with their Macs and other Apple devices too. When you open the app up, you’ll see a list of devices registered to your Apple account, with help articles for each of them. Thankfully, the app doesn’t stop there — it also offers a live chat feature, so if you can’t find the help you need from the articles, you can get more personal help from an Apple support representative. Not only that, but if you can’t find what you need through the chat feature, you can then call a support agent. Last but not least, if all else fails, you can schedule an appointment at the nearest Apple Store. It seems as though the app is currently only being offered in English, but it’s available in a number of countries around the world, and it is likely we’ll see it open up to more languages in the future. It’s also likely we’ll see the app pre-loaded on future versions of the iPhone. You can get the app for yourself here.

Apple To Launch 3 iPads In March 2017 International Business Times 3 days ago Corazon Victorino © Provided by IBT US Apple could be holding a March 2017 event for the launch of three new iPad models. If the statements of Barclays analysts are to be believed, the Cupertino giant could be unveiling two new iPad Pro devices and a new iPad that will mark the start of a new series.  AppleInsider reported Friday that the iPads that Apple could be launching early next year are new iterations of the 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro tablets. In addition, Samsung’s biggest rival is also rumored to introduce to the market a bezel-less 10.9-inch iPad.   Per Barclays analysts, the 10.9-inch iPad is going to sport the same encolsure size as the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, but it will not have bezels on either side of its display. It is believed that the 10.9-inch model is going to mark the start of the new series of Apple tablets.

On the other hand, the new iteration of the 9.7-inch model is going to be the “low cost” tablet among the three, though it is part of the “Pro” series. This is because the device will be sold alongside the iPad Mini.  Consumers should not expect that the 9.7-inch iPad Pro to debut with premium specs. According to PhoneArena, it is very likely that the smallest tablet among the upcoming three would be manufactured with entry-level specs only. Apple is reportedly planning to lure customers who want a more affordable iOS-running tablet with this iteration. Though no pricing details are available as of late, the new 9.7-inch iPad Pro could sell for a little more than the iPad Mini.  Per GSM Arena, since Apple is not planning to refresh the iPad Mini this year, it’s possible for a new model for the Mini line to arrive next year. This is contrary to reports that surfaced in August saying that Apple could be phasing out its 7.9-inch iPad Mini line because it failed to attract a lot of customers ever since the Plus line of the iPhone was launched.

We share with you how the new tech will work. In the picture is the popular iPhone 6.  ( Kārlis Dambrāns | Flickr ) Advertisement Apple is anticipated to unleash its 10th anniversary edition of the iPhone — dubbed the iPhone 8 — in the second half of 2017. Rumors related to the smartphone have been emerging online and the latest buzz pertains to the alleged wireless charging technology the handset will support. According to a new report, Apple is eyeing the implementation of a new module into the next-gen iPhone. "The company is supposedly looking to implement some sort of module into the iPhone 8 that will connect to a transmitter that gets plugged into a wall outlet. This setup will then allow the iPhone 8 to charge as long as it's within 15 feet of the transmitter, and if this turns out to be true, it could easily be the best method of wireless charging that we've seen yet," reports PhoneArena. Apple is reportedly working in tandem with Energous for the new technology. Energous has affirmed in the past that was collaborating with a "tier 1 manufacturer" in the smartphone space, and experts assumed the company to be Apple. In January this year, we brought to light that the wireless charging technology Apple was preparing was far superior than the traditional charging mats available. Rumors suggested that the company was working with its partners in Asia and the United States to make the wireless tech a reality in 2017. Earlier in February, we reported that Apple was possibly partnering with Energous, the company behind WattUp, an upcoming wireless charging tech that deploys radio frequencies. This tech could potentially enable people to charge their devices even when they would be several feet away from the charging point. In October we shared that Apple was testing the wireless technology  at Foxconn. Now the grapevine reveals that Energous has supposedly received $10 million in funding from Dialog Semiconductor, whose top customer is none other than Apple, accounting for almost 70 percent of the latter's sales. How Will The Tech Work? The WattUp system basically uses a Power Router, which uses radio frequency signals to emanate energy. This signal is transformed into power, which is able to charge batteries that have a WattUp receiver, the possible chip in the iPhone. You simply have a designated charging point or base station and put the iPhone anywhere within a perimeter of 15 feet. A small chip on the iPhone would connect wirelessly to the base station and begin to charge the device's battery. How Will It Be Useful? If such a tech saw the light of day, then one could possibly be in the kitchen and still charge their iPhone from the charging point located in the living area, which was a maximum of 15 feet away. Moreover, one would potentially be able to charge multiple compatible iDevices simultaneously — up to 12 thanks to this tech.

January 29 AAPL: 97.34 3.25 How-To: Automate weight logging w/ the Health app using Siri, Workflow, or a smart scale Greg Barbosa - 10 months ago @gregbarbosa iPad Apple Watch iPhone iOS Devices Apps Comments (11) Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit When news came out that Apple was working on a dedicated Health dashboard app, which would offer a way to take healthcare monitoring mobile, I was extremely excited. I had been recently diagnosed with traumatic arthritis in my knees and I needed a better all-in-one system to track my steps, weight, and BMI. None of the other apps on the market at the time seemed to do any one of those three especially well. Apple’s Health app has since become my go-to app for everything I wanted to log and more. It’s not perfect, but it’s a built-in dashboard with tie-ins to plenty of iOS apps. Within a few weeks of using Health, I soon realized I wanted a better way to automate inputting data into the system. I eventually came to a methodology that worked great for me and decided it was time to share three of the different ways you can automate quickly logging your weight into the Health app. Workflow Before I decided to make the plunge into purchasing a smart scale, I knew I wanted to start taking advantage of automating my weight tracking immediately. Many of the other apps that existed out there made the steps to get in and actually log weight just too cumbersome and complicated for what I really needed. This is where Workflow delivered for me. Workflow (currently $2.99), released a little over a year ago, is an Automator-like tool for iOS. You’re are able to combine different actions together to create something akin to small apps, a workflow. When Workflow was first released, I knew I would be able to use this to log my weight without having to rely on an expensive smart scale. If you’d like to get started using the workflow I created, open this link on your iPhone after installing Workflow. For this particular workflow, I only needed two actions: ‘Ask for Input’ and ‘Log Health Sample’. Once they were added in, I then changed the workflow’s settings so that it was set to a ‘Today Widget‘ and ‘Apple Watch‘ workflow. From there, every morning I would wake up, walk to my basic bathroom scale (an older version of the Sunbeam Easy Read Dial scale), and then log my weight directly from Notification Center or my Apple Watch. Siri Want a less robust but free automation solution? A bit of a hidden feature of Siri in iOS 9 is the ability to be reminded of whatever is currently in context in any given supported app. For example, I could be looking at an iMessage thread, activate Siri, and say “Remind me about this in 15 minutes.” It would then create the reminder for me as expected, but it also includes a direct link back to that Messages thread. This becomes especially useful for remembering to actually log your weight. The biggest problem I had at the start of my whole weight-logging experiment was that I frequently forgot to log it every morning. The more data you log, the more interesting trends will be. To mitigate this, I opened the weight section under the Health app and told Siri “Remind me of this every day at 8:30 AM”. Now when the reminder comes in the morning, I can just launch directly into the Health app from the reminder and input my weight in the correct section. For those that have configured weight-logging using the Workflow app from above, using Siri here is also a great way to bring it one step closer to full automation since you can build them both together. Smart Scale After nearly a year of logging my weight using a mix of these automation methods, I eventually decided it was time to upgrade this process and get a smart scale. I wanted to get a more precise read-out of my weight changes than just relying on a basic scale. Apple has listed the Withings Smart Body Analyzer under its health accessories for the a long time, and with good reason too. Although our primary focus is on weight logging, the Withings scale includes a cornucopia of other features including air quality monitoring and heart rate measurements. The most attractive part of this scale for me was the fact that it also supported logging multiple family members, up to eight different users. It’s a great way to get the whole family more aware of their health in general. Another popular alternative smart scale is the Fitbit Aria which has the advantage of integrating directly into the Fitbit ecosystem, while the Withings solution speaks to Apple’s Health app using HealthKit. Using the power of Workflow, Siri, and a smart scale, it becomes extremely easy to start recording health data and monitoring what it means for your well-being. With all these methods mixed together, I am now logging three major health points. With the smart scale I log my weight and BMI, and with Siri and Workflow, I am logging my caffeine and water intake as well. How are you using the Health app in your day-to-day life? What tools and accessories are you using to make logging the data more useful? I’m always looking for new ideas, so let us know in the comments below! Workflow is available for $2.99 in the App Store and is compatible with iPhones, iPads, and the Apple Watch (Health is only available on the iPod touch and iPhone). The Withings Smart Body Analyzer is available now for $99.99 in black or $149.99 in white, and the Fitbit Aria is available for $119. For those looking for just a basic (non-smart) scale take a look at the Etekcity Digital Body Weight Bathroom scale ($18.48), the BalanceFrom High Accuracy Premium Digital Bathroom Scale ($18.95), or the EatSmart Precision Digital Bathroom Scale ($24.95).

David Q - 10 months ago Reply I have the Withings scale and have found that my weight doesn’t register in the Heslth app until I open the Withings app on my phone first. Withings can automatically send my weight to MyFitnessPal without opening the app but not Apple Health. Wish there was a way to automate that because that’s the only reason I ever have to open the Withings app at all. LikeLike 3rdngoal - 10 months ago Reply I think you have to give the App permission to communicate with the Health.app. Have you done that? Open up Health,app and go under Sources. You should see options under each source to enable or disable. LikeLike David Q - 10 months ago Thank you. I think I figured out the problem. For some reason, Withings was not listed as the first source for recording wright data (it was third behind the Health app and Apple Watch). I moved it to first and will try again once I get home later today. LikeLike Corneliu Harea (@charea) - 10 months ago I do not have Withings listed in App permissions, anyone know why? I have the 6s. LikeLike Eyal Yeruham - 10 months ago Withings doesn’t show up as a source in Health. The only way to sync your weight is via MyFitnessPal – but then you will have to open that app for it to sync your weight from Withings and then to Health. Also it’s a shame, since all the other information goes unnoticed by Health since only your weight syncs. This means that BMI and heart rate doesn’t sync.. LikeLike Zombi Teks - 10 months ago Reply pretty dope, I like the fitbit myself. LikeLike Eyal Yeruham - 10 months ago Reply Somewhat related: does anyone else have the issue that an app that used to sync data to Health and was deleted from the phone doesn’t get fully removed from the list of App permissions within the Health app? LikeLike scottweidig - 10 months ago Reply @David you need to have the Withings HealthMate app installed on your device. That is what gives and gets the permissions for the Withings Smart Scale. I have oned one for about a year new and it is great. LikeLike k0jeg - 10 months ago Reply I’ve been using the Wahoo Fitness scale for a few months now. The reviews were mixed, with many people reporting inaccurate weight over repeated weigh-ins, even a few minutes apart. I guess I got one of the good ones, because mine is very consistent (sometimes frustratingly so!). It does tend to eat batteries. What I’d like to see is a stand-alone app (no need to log in and create a separate account like MyFitnessPal and the other “free” apps) that will track calorie intake as well. Preferably with a BT enabled food scale. Just pick the food from a list, put it on the scale and go. That way I could close the loop, because I know I’m not tracking all the calories as accurately as possible, even when I keep notes. LikeLike capdorf - 10 months ago Reply Should be pointed out prominently, no health app, no work. Or older iPad/Phone, no work. LikeLike happywatchblog - 3 days ago Reply This Workflow works great!

Called iBooks StoryTime, the app, available for free on the App Store, displays interactive books on the TV screen with the Read-Aloud feature, as well as lets pages be flipped with the Siri Remote’s touch pad. Read-Aloud features narration for the books, along with displaying subtitles on-screen to read along to. For supported books, things like sound effects and highlighted words are shown, and multiple character voices are used. When this mode is enabled, pages will automatically turn as the narration progresses. There’s also the option to turn Read-Aloud off, allowing pages to be turned with a swipe on the remote. This is designed to be used when a parent reads to a child themselves, or the child wants to practice reading themselves. “iBooks StoryTime gives your family a different way to experience classic kids’ books and discover new favorites. With Read-Aloud narration and beautiful illustrations, every handpicked title in the app transforms the Apple TV.” Among the supported Read-Along titles are Green Eggs and Ham, The ABCs of Cookies, The Little Red Hen, Goodnight Moon, Meet Tracker, Big Brother Daniel, and Chicka Chicka ABC. These can be purchased from iBooks on any iOS device, and they’ll automatically sync to the Apple TV. The iBooks StoryTime app also comes with Dora’s Big Buddy Race Read-Along Storybook for free, so Apple TV users can give it a try before buying anything.

However, only the iPhone 8 Plus will be fitted with an OLED display. Pictured is the newly released iPhone 7.  ( Sean Gallup | Getty Images ) Advertisement Industry experts report that Apple might have two new smartphones lined up for next year, both of which will feature curved, borderless designs. Analysts from Barclays Research said the tech company is looking to discard the traditional bezel design for its upcoming 5-inch and 5.8-inch iPhone units in order to make them as small as its current 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch offerings. While the design for the iPhone 8 hasn't been confirmed yet, the analysts believe that it could feature a bezel-less look with curved edges and a larger display compared with the original design. The new iPhone could move from 4.7 inches to 5 inches and its Plus version could move from 5.5 inches to 5.8 inches. These details reportedly came from sources within Apple's own supply chain while the analysts were on a recent trip to Asia. Rumored iPhone 8 Design According to MacRumors, the Barclays researchers added that the rumored 5.8-inch iPhone will be the only one to feature an OLED display, giving it a sharper and brighter screen. This will also allow the new handset to have a more energy efficient display compared with other smartphones with LCD screens. So far, Apple receives its supplies of OLED displays from rival smartphone makers LG and Samsung. Sharp is also slated to become a supplier by 2018. The latest iPhone 8 rumor supports earlier statements made by KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. In March, Kuo said that Apple will release a 5.8-inch version of its flagship iPhone with glass casing and curved OLED screen in 2017. Tech blogger and entrepreneur Robert Scoble said the iPhone 8 will have a clear glass case, which could be made from Gorilla Glass combined with polycarbonates for better durability. This clear glass look will allow Apple to incorporate augmented reality technology with the new smartphone. "You pop it into a headset which has eye sensors on it, which enables the next iPhone to have a higher apparent frame rate and polygon count than a PC with a Nvidia 1080 card in it," Scoble pointed out. Meanwhile, Japanese news website Nikkei reported that the upcoming iPhone will have a considerably larger display. This premium model will be featured alongside the company's 4.7-inch and 5-inch handsets that have LCD screens. As far as other possible designs for the iPhone 8 go, Barclays said it doesn't believe that the new smartphone will have its Home button embedded beneath its display, contrary to earlier rumors. The research firms said it is more likely that the upcoming handset will share a few design similarities with Xiaomi's Mi Mix, which features a slight bezel located at the bottom of the unit.

If the statements of Barclays analysts are to be believed, the Cupertino giant could be unveiling two new iPad Pro devices and a new iPad that will mark the start of a new series.  AppleInsider reported Friday that the iPads that Apple could be launching early next year are new iterations of the 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro tablets. In addition, Samsung’s biggest rival is also rumored to introduce to the market a bezel-less 10.9-inch iPad.  Per Barclays analysts, the 10.9-inch iPad is going to sport the same encolsure size as the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, but it will not have bezels on either side of its display. It is believed that the 10.9-inch model is going to mark the start of the new series of Apple tablets.

Apple TV tvOS Has A New Update For Developers Meanwhile, the upcoming 12.9-inch iPad Pro is expected to launch with the new True Tone display that’s already part of the current 9.7-inch iPad Pro. On the other hand, the new iteration of the 9.7-inch model is going to be the “low cost” tablet among the three, though it is part of the “Pro” series. This is because the device will be sold alongside the iPad Mini.  Consumers should not expect that the 9.7-inch iPad Pro to debut with premium specs. According to PhoneArena, it is very likely that the smallest tablet among the upcoming three would be manufactured with entry-level specs only. Apple is reportedly planning to lure customers who want a more affordable iOS-running tablet with this iteration. Though no pricing details are available as of late, the new 9.7-inch iPad Pro could sell for a little more than the iPad Mini.  Per GSM Arena, since Apple is not planning to refresh the iPad Mini this year, it’s possible for a new model for the Mini line to arrive next year. This is contrary to reports that surfaced in August saying that Apple could be phasing out its 7.9-inch iPad Mini line because it failed to attract a lot of customers ever since the Plus line of the iPhone was launched.  Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

November 12 AAPL: 108.43 0.64 First MacBook Pro with Touch Bar orders ship, deliver as soon as Monday Benjamin Mayo - 3 days ago @bzamayo MacBook Pro View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Apple has now started shipping the first new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar orders with the delivery notifications indicating that the laptops will arrive in people’s hands as soon as Monday, November 14. Several 9to5Mac readers and others online report receiving shipping notifications from Apple and or UPS, as pictured above and below. All shipped orders we’ve seen so far are for 15-inch MacBook Pro models. Shipment alerts for the 13-inch units will likely follow soon. Apple originally offered an estimated shipping timeframe of 2-3 weeks with the new MacBook Pro models that first went up for preorder on October 27 following the company’s unveiling. However, this quickly slipped to 4-5 weeks as customers snatched up the first major design revision to the MacBook Pro in four years. The Apple Store is still reporting 4-5 week delivery times for new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar orders. Here’s another 15-inch customer receiving shipment confirmation by UPS; often the courier beats Apple to posting the Shipped notifications on the tracking website. @9to5mac my shipping notification that came in today for a first day order 15" MBP estimates delivery of Monday pic.twitter.com/dfRqSr3ZBp — Andrew Rose (@andrewrose_) November 12, 2016 So far, we are yet to receive confirmation of shipments for 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar or non built-to-order 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar models. However, we expect all SKUs to be shipping shortly with deliveries across the week. @9to5mac @reneritchie received shipping notification for the MacBook Pro this morning. pic.twitter.com/12TADqri5l — Justin L. Fowler (@justinlfowler) November 12, 2016 At its October event, Apple relaunched the MacBook Pro line with three new laptops, a cheaper $1499 13-inch laptop and two new MacBook Pro with the new Touch Bar. The former model has been available for some time but the focus is on the ‘revolutionary’ Touch Bar equipped machines. Instead of physical function keys, the Touch Bar MacBook Pros feature a multitouch OLED screen where the function row usually resides on the keyboard. This enables Apple to offer dynamic buttons, sliders and contextual widgets relevant to the app the user is currently interacting with on the primary display. We’ve walked through how this works in Apple’s apps already and third-party developers have also started announcing integration with their apps. My MacBook Pro shipped. pic.twitter.com/38WUOVabBY — Aaron Zollo (@Zollotech) November 12, 2016 All new MacBook Pro’s feature upgraded CPU and GPU options, 100% faster SSD read and write speeds, USB-C Thunderbolt 3 ports, a larger trackpad and improved speaker system housed in a 20% thinner and smaller chassis enclosure. However, the new Pros have not been accepted by the community with open arms, far from it. The products have caused several controversies in the last few weeks. Most notably, Apple has removed all legacy IO (such as traditional USB-A ports, SD card reader and a HDMI port) in favour of Thunderbolt 3 USB-C ports. The 13-inch MacBook Pro has two USB-C ports and the 15-inch model has four. Although the port is much more flexible than what it replaces, some people were upset with the transition as it means customers need to buy an array of dongles, adaptors and new cables in order to connect their new laptop with existing accessories. In response, Apple is holding a temporary sale of USB-C accessories on its website through the end of the year. Apple has also been criticised for the lack of a 32 GB RAM option (Apple cited battery efficiency concerns) and the general price increases seen with the Touch Bar machines. The new 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar starts from $1799; the 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar starts from $2399. In terms of buyer response, though, the new laptops are appear to be selling well. Apple announced that the new MacBook Pros set a record for online Apple Store sales and a third-party analytics firm said the new MacBooks bested the rest of the industry in just 5 days.

Like what its name suggests, the app is designed to provide support to users through tips and informative articles.  TechCrunch reports that the Cupertino giant’s new app contains a mixture of product information, useful tips and a feature that would enable users to schedule repair appointments at an Apple Store or any authorized third-party shop.  The Apple Support app is designed for both the iPhone and the iPad. However, owners of these devices should know that the app is only compatible with iOS 9.0 and iOS 10. Also, Apple appears to be slowly rolling out this app, since it is only found on the App Store for the Netherlands as of press time.  Based on the official description of the app, it is a “personalized guide” for users of Apple devices. It is said to contain articles that are tailored to answer questions of users about the product they own. Per GSM Arena, the articles the app contains are “How To” reading materials.  Related Stories DoorDash iOS App Now Lets You Order Lunch Through iMessage Group Chat PayPal Debuts Siri Integration In Latest Update Apple Releases Minor iOS 10.1.1 Update The app also comes with a feature that allows users to chat or email an Apple Support technician. If this two are not enough for the user, he or she can make a call to schedule an appointment with a technician.  The screenshot of the app on the App Store for the Netherlands shows that it lists the products a user owns. The list is not limited to the iPhone and iPad only, since a MacBook could also be seen in the screenshot. Moreover, there’s an option that states “Get help with other products,” so the app could also have information about Apple’s other products aside from its smartphones, tablets and MacBooks. Apple Support app screenshot Photo: The Netherlands App Store   According to Engadget, reports about a standalone Apple support app have been circulating the web since last year, but it is only this week that the rumored app is materialized. The tech site also stated that it has reached out to Apple for details about the availability of the app in other countries, but the Cupertino giant has yet to respond.  Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

This Time, it’s the Apple iPhone 7 Plus Another Day, Another Smartphone Explosion! This Time, it’s the Apple iPhone 7 Plus Smartphone explosions have become a rage in recent times. Now, a person in China claims that his Apple iPhone 7 Plus exploded after supposedly dropping from two feet. By: Chakri Kudikala Published: Saturday, November 12, 2016, 16:35 [IST] Smartphone explosions are really pushing the users backwards. After the great Samsung Galaxy Note 7 debacle all these days, we are hit with yet another explosion coming from China. This time, it's not a Samsung device, but the South Korean giant's rival, Apple's iPhone 7 Plus. This news is coming all the way from China as a man accidentally loses control over his new iPhone 7 Plus and the outcome was really horrible. Instead of a cracked screen or dents on the phone, the device exploded horribly. SEE ALSO: Facebook's Messenger Rooms Feature Allow Public Group Chats Similar to Yahoo Chat Rooms Having said that, the phone was dropped just from two feet, which makes the incident even worst. Not so long ago, in Australia, an iPhone 7 exploded and Apple is still investigating that event. And this event makes things even worst for the Cupertino giant. SEE ALSO: Millions Declared Dead on Facebook Including Founder Mark Zuckerberg It's interesting to see how Apple will consider this incident. Thankfully, there was no harm to the owner of the smartphone. The major dent in the smartphone world was the recall Galaxy Note 7, which shook the entire industry. All said, the major issue for all these explosions is the smartphone's batteries.

White Nov 11, 2016 Business Share Tweet … LinkedIn Email Print Text Size During his campaign, Donald Trump touted his experience as a CEO and real-estate tycoon as his most significant qualification for president. His theory has in large part been that running a company counts as qualification for public office because it teaches one about taxes, how to grow a business, manage debt, and how deal with employees—skills he claims will translate to presidential success when it comes to the U.S. economy. Business owners, CEOs, and financial titans have traditionally leaned toward the conservative side when it comes to politics and economic ideology. In part, this is because they stand to benefit from policies that include less stringent regulation and lower taxes. Yet as of May 2016, few top business leaders had thrown money behind Trump’s campaign for the presidency. And some were very outspoken about their opposition to his candidacy. In the wake of Trump’s election, the business and finance community has weighed in on how (and if) they think the new president-elect will influence economic and business growth in the country. Many are also using the election’s results as a chance to address ethical or moral considerations, with many sending letters to their staff post-election. Here’s what they’ve said so far: Carl Icahn, the billionaire investor and long-time Trump supporter told CNBC that Trump’s victory was “a very important thing for our economy in general." Icahn was also excited about the victory for other reasons, including the fact that he reportedly poured around $1 billion into the stock market as futures tanked during the close race, and then presumably reaped the benefits as the market fully recovered on Wednesday. But Icahn and Trump may not see eye-to-eye on everything: The famed investor has said that he doesn’t support a repeal of Dodd-Frank, the post-crisis legislation that Trump has threatened to dispose of. Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Facebook posted a note on his personal page about watching the election with his daughter Max. In it he urged others to continue making strides on big, important task, regardless of who sits in the seat of the president: Holding Max, I thought about all the work ahead of us to create the world we want for our children. This work is bigger than any presidency and progress does not move in a straight line. The most important opportunities of Max's generation—like curing all disease, improving education, connecting everyone and promoting equal opportunity—will take long term focus and finding new ways for all of us to work together, sometimes over decades. Peter Thiel, a Facebook board member, investor, and vocal supporter of Trump told The Wall Street Journal that he thinks the Trump administration will focus on decreasing regulation and of small business and boosting fiscal stimulus. A lot of people voted for Trump because he just got it. He understood that things were very off track even if he didn’t have a precise road map of what to do. Other Republican candidates were almost delusionally Panglossian in their views of America. Hillary was also optimistic in a way that made her very out of touch It’s rumored that Thiel may become part of Trump’s transition team. Indra Nooyi, the CEO of Pepsi and a vocal supporter of Hillary Clinton started a conversation with The New York Times writer, Andrew Ross Sorkin, by first congratulating the president-elect. But, when asked about the crassness of Trump’s language toward women (Trump had once appeared in a Diet Pepsi ad in 1988) and domestic-violence issues among NFL players (Pepsi is an NFL sponsor), and how these issues affect the Pepsi brand, Nooya was more pointed:* “Forget the Pepsi brand — how dare you talk about women that way?” Ms. Nooyi said. “Why do you talk that way about a whole group of citizens?” Also in conversation with Sorkin, Aetna’s CEO, Mike Bertolini, admitted that the company was blindsided by the election, and must now hypothesize what will happen to healthcare and the Affordable Care Act, which Trump has previously vowed to repeal. Bertolini is optimistic that some tenants of the bill will remain: coverage for children until the age of 26, and Medicaid expansion, for example. Other tenets, such as the high tax on high premium plan might be completely done away with. Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple wrote a letter to his staff (published by BuzzFeed) addressing the divisive political election, but never naming Trump. He urged employees to move forward in the spirit of togetherness and offered reassurance that business would continue as usual: While there is discussion today about uncertainties ahead, you can be confident that Apple’s North Star hasn’t changed. Our products connect people everywhere, and they provide the tools for our customers to do great things to improve their lives and the world at large. Our company is open to all, and we celebrate the diversity of our team here in the United States and around the world — regardless of what they look like, where they come from, how they worship or who they love. Trump and Apple have come into conflict before, with Trump criticizing the company’s overseas manufacturing operation, saying, “We're gonna get Apple to start building their damn computers and things in this country, instead of in other countries.” Jeff Bezos, the CEO of Amazon and owner of the Washington Post made a statement that some saw as conciliatory, given the fact that Trump vowed to have the company investigated for antitrust violations and tax violations. On Twitter, Bezos wrote: Congratulations to @realDonaldTrump. I for one give him my most open mind and wish him great success in his service to the country. — Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) November 10, 2016 GrubHub’s CEO, Matt Maloney, wrote an email to his staff expressing surprise at the results and disagreement with the morals he attributes to Trump’s policies. In closing, he said that those who didn’t believe in inclusiveness should quit: I absolutely reject the nationalist, anti-immigrant and hateful politics of Donald Trump and will work to shield our community from this movement as best as I can. As we all try to understand what this vote means to us, I want to affirm to anyone on our team that is scared or feels personally exposed, that I and everyone else here at Grubhub will fight for your dignity and your right to make a better life for yourself and your family here in the United States. If you do not agree with this statement then please reply to this email with your resignation because you have no place here. We do not tolerate hateful attitudes on our team. I want to repeat what Hillary said this morning, that the new administration deserves our open minds and a chance to lead, but never stop believing that the fight for what's right is worth it. Maloney's statement was criticized shortly after it was made public, with some suggesting that he told staffers who voted for Trump to leave. In a second statement Maloney clarifies the intent of his message: I did not ask for anyone to resign if they voted for Trump. I would never make such a demand. To the contrary, the message of the email is that we do not tolerate discriminatory activity or hateful commentary in the workplace, and that we will stand up for our employees. Grubhub welcomes and accepts employees with all political beliefs, no matter who they voted for in this or any election. We do not discriminate on the basis of someone's principles, or political or other beliefs. Mohamed El-Erian, the chief economic advisor at Allianz, appeared on CNBC saying that that markets rebounded in the wake of a massive decline in futures in part because Trump’s late night acceptance speech was more gracious and conciliatory than his campaign. The markets will continue to move in his favor if he maintains the same tone, and focuses corporate tax rates, deregulation, and infrastructure, according to El-Erian. But prioritizing protectionism could quickly make markets sour. So far, much of the response to Trump’s election—including from Trump himself—seems to be about tone setting. The President-elect’s rhetoric in recent days has been more toned down and focused on unification than it was for much of the election. Business leaders, even those who vocally opposed Trump, are taking the same tack and hoping that markets, investors, and consumers will respond positively to a collective confidence and hopefulness about the future of the economy. * This article has been updated to clarify that Nooyi’s comments were in response to a question about the NFL in addition to Trump.

Twitter Facebook Email previousThe U.S. Media Is Completely Unprepared to Cover a Trump PresidencynextFacebook Goes Full Nietzsche, Declares Users Dead Most Popular Presented by Carlos Barria / Reuters Why Hillary Clinton Lost Molly Ball As devastated Democrats cast about for explanations, her campaign’s decisions have come under scrutiny. Why did Hillary Clinton lose last week’s presidential election? The candidate herself believes James Comey, the FBI director who notified Congress in an October 28 letter that he was reopening the inquiry into her private emails, was to blame. Her campaign, meanwhile, has cited “a host of uncontrollable headwinds,” asserting that her team did all they could in an unforeseeably difficult environment. Many Democrats, however, are less forgiving of the campaign and its strategy. It may be true that the Comey letter shaved a crucial few points off Clinton’s vote in the home stretch. But critics believe a better campaign would have left her less exposed to a last-minute surprise. If not for a series of miscalculations, these critics contend, the Comey letter wouldn’t have had the impact it did—and she might be president today. Continue Reading Oliver Munday China’s Great Leap Backward James Fallows The country has become repressive in a way that it has not been since the Cultural Revolution. What does its darkening political climate—and growing belligerence—mean for the United States? What if China is going bad? Since early last year I have been asking people inside and outside China versions of this question. By “bad” I don’t mean morally. Moral and ethical factors obviously matter in foreign policy, but I’m talking about something different. Nor is the question mainly about economics, although for China the short-term stability and long-term improvement of jobs, wages, and living standards are fundamental to the government’s survival. Under China’s single-party Communist arrangement, sustained economic failure would naturally raise questions about the system as a whole, as it did in the Soviet Union. True, modern China’s economic performance even during its slowdowns is like the Soviet Union’s during its booms. But the absence of a political outlet for dissatisfaction is similar. Continue Reading Nathan Chute / Reuters Better Off Before Obamacare? Olga Khazan Before the law, which Trump has said he would repeal, health insurance was cheaper for a few, but outright unattainable for many. Throughout his campaign, President-Elect Donald Trump repeatedly vowed to repeal and replace Obamacare, which he called “a disaster.” That was music to his supporters’ ears. Repealing Obamacare is Republican voters’ biggest priority for the Trump administration, according to a recent Politico/Morning Consult poll. People who are unhappy with the Affordable Care Act overwhelmingly voted for Trump, and now 74 percent of Republicans want it gone. The frustration with the health law is understandable; many people are struggling to afford medical care even if they have insurance. The problem is, it’s not clear Americans would have been better off had Obamacare never been passed. First, some people might be confused about what, exactly, they’re angry at. When we talk about “Obamacare,” we’re talking primarily about the 12.7 million people who are buying individual insurance coverage through state marketplaces or Healthcare.gov. Roughly 60 million people voted for Trump last week, so they can’t all be on Obamacare exchange plans. More than half of all non-elderly Americans still get insurance through work, and premiums on employer-based plans are actually growing more slowly than average. (About a third of Americans are either on Medicare or Medicaid, and the rest are uninsured. Only about 4 percent are on the exchanges.) Continue Reading CBS Stephen Colbert Finds Refuge in Punditry Megan Garber The comedian has long chafed against the bipartisan mandates of network TV. Now he’s taking sides. On Monday evening, Stephen Colbert, television host and comedian, engaged in some light explanation of the political and cultural significance of the alt-right movement in the United States. Colbert, in the opening monologue of the Late Show, summarized for his audience the meaning of Steve Bannon, Trump’s newly appointed chief of White House strategy. “Bannon is considered a leader of what’s known as the alt-right,” Colbert said—“an extreme online movement with ties to white supremacy.” The comedian paused. “Here’s how to understand the alt-right: Think about what’s right, then think about the alternative to that.” Bannon, Colbert added, for more context, “is best known for running something called Breitbart News. If you’ve never read Breitbart, it’s the news your racist uncle gets sent to him by his racist uncle.” Continue Reading Mark Makela / Reuters Liberals Have a Choice: Reach Out to Trump Voters, or Condemn Them Emma Green If progressives want to win back political influence in America, they may need the support of the people they see as racists. PHILADELPHIA—They marched defiantly down John F. Kennedy Boulevard, carrying signs that said “White violence is silence!” and “Dykes against the Klan!” They were young, mostly female, some with blue and shock-blonde hair shaved up the sides. They were black women, brown women, gay women, trans women. They were there to protest the election. They were self-described feminists, fighting back. As Washington slowly hobbles back toward normal, with talk of transition teams and cabinet appointments and the first 100 days, progressives are still reeling. Late last week, several hundred people gathered for multiple rallies in Philadelphia, but this hasn’t just been happening in Pennsylvania. Thousands of protesters outside Trump Tower in New York. Students walking out of class in Oakland. People occupying New York Senator Chuck Schumer’s office in D.C. This is not just “small groups of protesters” coming together, as Donald Trump put it last week. Continue Reading Jason Reed / Reuters ‘The Smell of Corruption Emanating From the Clinton Machine’ Chris Bodenner None So far we’ve heard from two Trump voters in great detail: Alan, who’s most animated by identity politics, and our Southern reader who wants to take a “wrecking ball” to Washington. But both readers also had major qualms with the Trump candidacy. Another reluctant Trump voter, Marco, describes his deep aversion to establishmentarianism and dynastic politics—and doesn’t spare the Republicans one bit: We shouldn’t be asking what happened with Trump. What happened to The Atlantic? I’ve been a reader for years, after abandoning Time and Newsweek because of their People-like superficiality. The appearance of considered thoughts at The Atlantic is what kept me there. But since you decided to take sides in the presidential election, strident hysterical writing is all I find, especially on November 9. That’s perhaps understandable The Day After, but, folks, the sky won’t fall. It won’t fall because the U.S. government’s institutions are designed to prevent irrational outcomes to a good degree. Trust the system a little, if you learned anything from history. I probably do not feel the pain to the same degree as you do, though I am concerned, and on pins and needles. I admit it: I voted for Trump—at the limit of my tolerance for bad taste and unhinged statements. But I did so not because I am an undereducated, violent, intolerant, gun-waving xenophobe—as the press has made habit of defining Trump supporters. I have an MBA. I refuse violence and support gun control. And I’m an immigrant, now a citizen after obtaining green cards twice, all by the legal process. I voted for Trump only because of the smell of corruption emanating from the Clinton Machine. That smell is well documented by Wikileaks and Podesta’s emails depicting the Clinton Foundation / State Department connections. To that you can add the past four decades of continuous scandals—why only them with so many? You get my picture. But there is one more reason to fear their corruption: the history of ALL countries around the world, since WWII, where an immediate relative followed a president or PM (see my list below). In all cases, either the “succession” was made possible by endemic corruption, or advanced it as a result, or both. This is to be expected when the vested interests supporting one person get to take advantage of continued control of the government from behind the scenes by electing the relative. Continue Reading NASA The Prospect of a New Dark Age Ross Andersen How President-elect Trump could affect our ability to understand our changing planet Last Thursday, there was a moment when it was possible to hope that Donald Trump’s presidency wouldn't be as ecologically catastrophic as many feared. As with so many matters of serious policy, Trump’s approach to the environment is difficult to predict, given the paucity of detailed plans he has released, and his tendency to switch positions on a whim. And so, when several of his more extreme campaign promises vanished from his official website, including his vow to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement on climate change, I wondered if he’d reconsidered. Perhaps he decided to heed President Obama’s advice. Perhaps he was swayed by China’s grumbling. Or perhaps, the collected works of an entire generation of climate scientists finally persuaded him that it would be foolish to abandon a collective pledge, negotiated by all of Earth’s nations, to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions.

On the morning of Monday, August 13, 2012, Scott Stevens loaded a brown hunting bag into his Jeep Grand Cherokee, then went to the master bedroom, where he hugged Stacy, his wife of 23 years. “I love you,” he told her. Stacy thought that her husband was off to a job interview followed by an appointment with his therapist. Instead, he drove the 22 miles from their home in Steubenville, Ohio, to the Mountaineer Casino, just outside New Cumberland, West Virginia. He used the casino ATM to check his bank-account balance: $13,400. He walked across the casino floor to his favorite slot machine in the high-limit area: Triple Stars, a three-reel game that cost $10 a spin. Maybe this time it would pay out enough to save him.

Last night, and later tonight, skywatchers around the world will be treated to views of this year's so-called "supermoon," the largest full moon of the year. Today, on November 14, at 6:20 am Eastern time, the moon approached within 356,500 km (221,500 mi) of Earth, in what is scientifically known as a perigee-syzygy of the Earth-Moon-Sun system (perigee: closest point of an elliptical orbit; syzygy: straight line made of three bodies in a gravitational system). Though the moon does appear larger than normal, the size difference is so small that a casual observer would probably never notice. Nonetheless, photographers across the globe set out to capture the event, and collected here are 21 of the most super images of this year's supermoon. If your skies are clear, be sure to look up around moonrise tonight.

During his victory speech last week, President-elect Donald Trump devoted more than a single sentence to just one piece of policy. It wasn’t a border wall or immigration, nor trade, nor even Obamacare. Instead, the very first specific promise Trump made upon claiming the presidency was to follow through on the one issue that united him and Hillary Clinton—and divided Republicans in Washington: infrastructure. “We are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals,” the president-elected pledged. “We’re going to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none. And we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it.” Continue Reading We're Probably Imagining Aliens Wrong Nadine Ajaka Why haven’t we found extraterrestrial life?

  SOFTPEDIA® DESKTOP Windows Games Drivers Mac Linux MOBILE Android APK Phones Tablets WEB Webscripts Web Browsers NEWS Softpedia > News > Apple > iWorld > iPhone FLASH SALE: SpyShelter Firewall      30% OFF! iPhone 8 to Launch with Curved 5.0-Inch and 5.8-Inch Displays and No Bezels GO Analyst cites sources from the supply chain in iPhone 8 speculation, adding that Apple is aiming for a bezel-less design Nov 12, 2016 08:44 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  The next-year iPhone is expected to bring a major overhaul of the existing design, as Apple will celebrate the 10th anniversary of the device, and an analyst now claims that Cupertino is also planning some changes in terms of display size. Barclays forecasts, citing sources from the supply chain, that the iPhone 8 will come with curved screens that will use 5.0-inch and 5.8-inch panels, which means that Apple will increase the size of the iPhone from the existing 4.7- and 5.5-inch models. The iPhone 8 will also adopt a new design, with Apple planning to offer a phone with no bezels, the analyst says. While there’s no confirmation of such a thing, this isn’t the first time we’re hearing about such a plan, with Apple also believed to be working on integrating all front-facing parts into the screen. All-in on the display The company holds patents that allow it to include the FaceTime camera into the display and the removal of the physical Home button from the iPhone 7 is also believed to be a step forward towards the integration into the screen on the next model. If this is true, then Apple could remove the bottom part of the iPhone and go for a bezel-less approach that would put the screen at the center of the whole design. Furthermore, with such a look, the iPhone 8 could have approximately the same dimensions as the existing iPhones, as Apple would only increase the size of the display, but reduce the bezels, obtaining a better screen-to-body ratio. There are also reports that the iPhone 8 could be made entirely of glass and feature an AMOLED display and this is also very likely given the fact that Apple has already discussed such plans with several manufacturers. Keep in mind that all these details are still in the rumor stage for the time being and it’s better to take them with a healthy pinch of salt. The iPhone 8 is projected to launch in the fall of 2017, so quite a lot can change in the meantime, but either way, expect it to be a dramatic overhaul of the existing models. #Apple#iPhone#iPhone 8#iPhone 7 subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news More Evidence Shows iPhone 8 Could Feature Revolutionary Wireless Charging Father Says iPhone Nearly Caught Fire in His Daughter’s Pocket Trump Edition Gold-Plated iPhone 7 Up for Grabs for $3,000 iPhone 7 Plus Reportedly Explodes After Accidental Drop Apple Insider Says iPhone 6 Plus Has a Major Bug, Company Should Start Recall Hackers Steal FIFA Currency, Buy Houses and Expensive Cars with the Money WhatsApp Announces Video Calling Rolling Out to Android, iOS Users Microsoft Announces Black Friday 2016 Deals: Perfect Time to Go Windows 10 KDE Frameworks 5.28.0 Released with Numerous KWayland Improvements, More NVIDIA Makes Available GeForce Graphics Driver 375.86 - Get It Now Microsoft CEO Meets Chinese Official One Day After Warning on Trump Tax Plan Apple Downplays Microsoft Surface, Says Having Touch on a Desktop Is a Disaster    iPhone 7 in matte black new ios apps NeuroNation: Train your brain to improve your memory and focus with NeuroNation Flipagram: Create cool videos by mixing up your photos with music Timer+: Set up dozens of timers and control them all with ease Nutshell Camera: Create some pretty cool videos with Nutshell Camera IKEA Catalogue: Check out the IKEA Catalogue for more than just furniture Complete: Complete puts a social twist to your regular to-do list/ task manager WebMD Baby: WebMD Baby offers help in how to best tend to your baby Reader comments Apple Insider Says iPhone 6 Plus Has a Major Bug, Company Should Start Recall more on: Apple i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

Apple currently plans to wrap up construction by late 2016, so it’s possible the company could move into the new 2.8 million sq ft location starting sometime in early 2017. Apple has been providing sporadic updates on progress on the site, but we have a more comprehensive timeline below that we’ll update as we follow along with Apple’s progress on the under-construction Campus 2 facility in Cupertino.

Hospital stocks are one, with the prospect of Obamacare being unwound. Tech is another. Most of the biggies lost ground, in part because of the things President-elect Donald Trump has said about some of the tech sectors' biggest names — Apple CEO Tim Cook and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos among them. But they also lost ground in part because of what Donald Rumsfeld would call unknown unknowns — the incoming administration's tech policies. We talked with senior tech correspondent Molly Wood about tech policies under a Trump administration.  So what do we know about President-elect Trump's proposed policies for the tech industry? We know next to nothing. In fact, the plan for the first 100 days that is up on the Trump campaign website says nothing about technology. I think there's one line about technical education in a section about schools. The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, which is a non-partisan think tank, have done their best to try to cobble together what might be a bit of tech policy, and mostly, to be honest, it centers around how the business policies might affect the tech industry, specifically around lowering taxes and, of course, immigration policy, and as for the rest of it, it's anybody's guess.   What will happen to the H-1B visas that many tech companies use to hire skilled workers from outside the U.S.? Silicon Valley is extremely concerned about the H-1B visa program. And Donald Trump has said that it is an excuse for people in the valley to hire outside workers and not American workers. But he has not, and is very unlikely, to implement any sort of corresponding funding for technical education in this country, STEM education. He maintains that we graduate more than enough people in fields of technology that should be able to fill those jobs.  Where does innovation in the tech industry go when we literally don't know what the Trump administration's tech policy will be?  I think you could argue that it's an opportunity to innovate around that uncertainty, or to try to set an agenda to get in his ear quickly, and convince him, for one thing, that these issues are important. I think that what Silicon Valley's really worried about is that this has been a really vibrant sector of our economy, and that technology touches every single part of every other business. It is integral to conversations about globalization, to conversations about job growth, because so many of the jobs that the Trump administration is talking about trying to create or bring home are jobs that have been or will very soon be automated. So I think that it's an opportunity for Silicon Valley, if it can stop the freak out, to say, "How can we help shape this agenda in a positive way? Because that's what we do."

It wasn’t long after the original 12-inch MacBook landed that we began our love-hate relationship with USB-C. It was universal, which is great, but without the lineup of our favorite ports on the MacBook, many started to consider life a dongled hell. With the new MacBooks Pro, Apple did its best to change all of that, and its famed reality distortion field helped assuage much of our contempt for USB-C. Pay close attention, and you’ll notice that the term USB-C was muttered only once during Apple’s MacBook unveiling. Phil Schiller said it, and it was only in reference to the connector’s for-factor. Instead, Apple turned the term ‘USB-C’ into ‘Thunderbolt 3,’ which is much more alluring and magical. We tend to think of Thunderbolt as a high-end data transfer port capable of ungodly things — mostly because it’s really that good. With Thunderbolt 3, we’re getting even more good stuff. 40Gbps data transfer is insane, even though it commands a special (expensive!) cable to get there. Apple’s own website leaves USB-C out of the mix, except to discuss the port’s form-factor. Instead, those connection points on a MacBook are now Thunderbolt. Seeing the trend? Reality distortion. A touch of genius. This isn’t a new strategy, and to be fair — Apple’s not wrong, or lying. The ports are Thunderbolt 3 capable inlets; we’re talking distortion, not lies. Apple has done this before, too. The original Thunderbolt ports used the same connection type as Mini DisplayPort, but we didn’t really call them that. Like the new Pros, the former had Thunderbolt ports. But we didn’t have such vitriol surrounding Mini DisplayPort, and it wasn’t in use on smartphones or peripherals. Nobody was calling for Apple to make it universal across mobile and desktop. But Thunderbolt — that’s desktop-class, and a technology many equate to Apple anyway. And once again, Apple is spinning things to make them palatable to a wider audience. If we stop thinking of it as USB-C, and stop calling it USB-C — it’s Thunderbolt. Then it’s special. It’s Apple. And then we stop complaining, and start paying a premium for accessories and dongles because we’ve conditioned ourselves to. Suddenly, and perhaps without even realizing it, everything about the future Apple has pushed us into with these new USB-C Thunderbolt 3 ports seems very normal.

Macs & Mac OS X | 04 Nov 2016 | Listen  | Print  | Comment (28) Responding to Complaints, Apple Drops Adapter and Monitor Prices by Josh Centers Many Apple fans have been irked by how the new line of MacBook Pro laptops offers only Thunderbolt 3 ports (which are backward compatible with USB-C). To connect to existing peripherals, users will require one or more adapters, such as those for USB-A, DisplayPort, HDMI, Ethernet, and even older implementations of Thunderbolt. See “Explaining Thunderbolt 3, USB-C, and Everything In Between” (3 November 2016) for a thorough explanation. Apple doesn’t get any points for thinking ahead, but happily, the company does appear to be responding to the waves of criticism. According to the Loop, Apple is dropping prices on many of its adapters through the end of 2016. Affected products include: USB-C to USB Adapter: from $19 to $9 Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter: from $49 to $29 USB-C to Lightning Cable (1m): from $25 to $19 USB-C to Lightning Cable (2m): from $35 to $29 USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter: from $69 to $49 USB-C VGA Multiport Adapter: from $69 to $49 Apple is also discounting other USB-C products sold in the company’s online store, such as the SanDisk Extreme Pro SD UHS-II Card USB-C Reader, which drops from $49 to $29. If you purchased any of these adapters in the past 14 days — Apple’s return window — the company may automatically credit you for the difference in price; Adam Engst got email from Apple about that after the initial publication of this article. If you don’t hear from Apple in a few days, I recommend calling them and asking for a partial refund. I did that and obtained a $30 refund for my USB-C to USB Adapter and my Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter. MacRumors reports that Apple has also cut the price of the LG UltraFine 5K Display, which it developed with LG, from $1299 to $974 until the end of 2016. Also, Apple slashed the price of the LG UltraFine 4K Display from $699 to $524. The 5K Display isn’t yet available for sale but should launch in December 2016. Apple could have avoided the entire hullaballoo by including an adapter or two in the box with new MacBook Pros or giving customers the option to receive the adapter of their choice for free when ordering. Instead, Apple came off as trying to nickel-and-dime its most eager customers, who were already spending significant sums on the company’s latest gear. And even still, dropping the prices only through the end of 2016 seems stingy, given that Apple’s adapters and cables are almost always the most expensive by far.   READERS LIKE YOU!

Receive comments via RSS Add a comment Mike  2016-11-04 20:48 The one cable that absolutely should have been in there is the Type C to type A adapter, but a USB-C lightening cable should also have been included. As it stands if you buy a laptop and a Magic Mouse you have to pay another $9 just to be able to charge it. I also wish they had a MagSafe to TB3 adapter, as the MagSafes weren't cheap and still work well. Maybe someone else will be able to pull that off with a shallow rough port that it could stay plugged in. Reply dbrugger   2016-11-04 21:27 Quite frankly, Apple has stopped being Apple for the last two machine re-dos, dropping things and adding things as if they were Microsoft software. Waiting for a new laptop, I feel betrayed and that Apple is changing for the sake of changing without any very real innovation. I'm on the search for old refurbished models that have what I want and need. Too bad! Reply Simon   2016-11-05 04:12 Unfortunately I have to agree. As sad as it is. Reply Reinard Schmitz   2016-11-05 05:15 Yep. Sadly I've to agree. Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc  2016-11-08 21:01 Me too. Apple long since lost sight of their customers. In my book the trend began with OS X Lion, which bleached the color, and thus much of the utility (ease of use) out of the Finder window side bar. They only made the problem worse with OS X 10.10 Yosemite, when even more color, depth and usability bled away from the UI. A year from now most the noise over the Thunderbolt 3 ports will have subsided as people adapt to the change. The expense of that adaptation, however, will not be forgotten and it is likely to drive up sales of used Macs. I recently got a good price on eBay for a unibody MacBook Pro, a line which, not coincidentally, is still user serviceable. I replaced the HDD with a comparably sized SSD for about $150 - and it connects to all my gear. As for using adaptors, well, I got used to that problem while servicing MacBook Airs and 11" MacBook Pros, all of which have been short on ports from their inception. I've got Thunderbolt to this and that in my gadget bag. Now I'll have to add TB 3 to this and that. I'm just glad they didn't limit the number of ports any more radically than they did with the new MacBook Pros. Given the precedent set by the MacBook, it could have been worse. Of course, Apple thinks everything can and should be done in the cloud now. But the cloud, particularly iCloud, is far from reliable and even less secure. But, hey, Apple couldn't care less how their imperfect solutions affect actual users. It's their policy and they're sticking with it. Longterm my biggest concern for Apple is their unwillingness to develop a touch-screen PC. Because to do so, of course, would be to admit that Microsoft had a better idea. As far as technology trends go, this is a big one and Apple is ignoring it. Sure, a touch-screen Mac, particularly a laptop, would cut into iPad sales. But touch-screen Windows PCs are going to be shading Apple big time going forward. Adding a few bells and whistles, like the Touch Bar, to the MacBook Pro will not make up the difference. Microsoft ads for the Surface Pro may be obnoxious, but they are on point nonetheless. Touch-screen PCs are not a fad, like Netbooks, that Apple can safely dismiss. They are the future, a future in which Apple is unwilling to participate. And now that Microsoft has introduced their touch-screen desktop computer, the Surface Studio, with a hinge mount that declines to emulate a drawing table (like a Wacom Cintiq), with a Surface Pen and Surface Dial, a high resolution 28" screen that matches the color gamut of the Cintiq, it won't be long before graphics professionals begin to look beyond their iMacs. As it is now you can use a Cintiq with your iMac if you're got room on your desk for the setup, but the Surface Studio will have a much smaller footprint, combining the utility of a capable computer with a large, adjustable, graphics tablet—at half the price. Certainly things aren't going to change overnight, but to my mind the writing is on the wall. Apple's executives are far to insular, cut off from the every day working world of their users. Who would have thought, a decade ago, that Microsoft would be leading Apple in innovation? Reply Simon   2016-11-09 05:20 I'm actually very happy they are refusing to do a touch-screen Mac. One of Steve's strongest suits was recognizing what not to do and knowing when to stay simple. Apple's stance on this issue would have been the same under Steve and I'm very happy about that. No matter how many shiny ads MS puts out and no matter how much consumers think everything has to converge up to the point where your car is also your fridge. Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc  2016-11-09 05:03 Glib remarks about cars and fridges don't enhance your argument. It's not about what consumers think, it's about what they buy. If they don't buy Macs, Apple is in trouble. QED. As for what Steve would like or what he would do, he didn't like the idea of a small iPad or a big iPhone, but Apple is selling them both now. He didn't like dabbling in the enterprise, but Apple is working with IBM and Cisco to expand their footprint in business. Supposing that Steve would like what you like is, well, supply your own synonym for foolish. Personally, I don't need or want a touch-screen computer. But what I want is less than insignificant. Nonetheless, I see the market moving to touch-screen PCs and Apple missing the boat. We're not talking fads here. As I mentioned, Apple made a small iPad when the market favored small tablets and they made large iPhones when the market was going that way. And they are moving into the enterprise to expand their role in business. Ultimately, whether or not to make a touch-screen Mac should be a rational business decision, not one guided by pride, vanity or sentiment. As for simplicity, there's nothing simple about using two devices to do the work of one. Nor is there anything simple about Apple's multi-device, multi-OS market strategy these days. What, pray tell, is simple about iCloud? What's simple about all those Apple apps in your dock? Simplicity is a them trotted out when it suits Apple's purposes and ignored when it does not. It's a red herring—at best. There's nothing simple about Apple. Reply Simon   2016-11-09 05:29 Pride or vanity has nothing to do with it at all. Bottom line is macOS has been heavily optimized for mouse/KB. It would need substantial changes to make it touch friendly. I want Apple to focus that energy on making sure it remains the best OS for mouse/KB. I don't want them to focus on adding something solely because supposedly many consumers are interested in that. Many consumers are also interested in Windows or McD. So what? Ignoring that crowd is not a problem as long as you remain more interested in product quality than in market share. Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc  2016-11-09 13:17 I see. It's all about what you want. Thanks for the heads up. Reply dave nuss   2016-11-04 21:47 Hi! I've seen this price reduction mentioned on several sites today but not mentioned and no email from Apple about those of us that forked over for new MBPs and dongles in the first minutes after the Hello Again... Do we get automagic refunds? ... I see Adam called and got some refund so I went to Apple Chat and after some time got the same. Sad they didn't just automatically apply the credits, but I guess that's how they build up that cash pile. Thanks for reporting this! Reply Adam Engst   2016-11-05 11:55 Josh was the one who called, but we also ordered an adapter last week, but I just got email from Apple saying they were refunding me automatically. I'll add that to the article. Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc  2016-11-08 19:25 Of course not. They're not going to give away money. If you snooze, you lose. Reply Michel Hedley  2016-11-05 02:34 These expensive Apple connectors are not well designed. They are prone to breaking at the plug end. For all of Apple's prowess in design, Apple can't seem to design peripherals that are fit for purpose and make them rugged enough for every day use. Reply Simon   2016-11-05 04:34 I'm really surprised by this move. Apple used to be very good at anticipating customer reaction. Now they come out a few days after the big launch and essentially declare they got the pricing all wrong. Has their marketing been taken over by a bunch of clowns? What have these guys been doing for the past months? Josh is absolutely right in his final paragraph. They could have handled this so much better. When did Apple become so bad at this game? Reply James  2016-11-06 10:31 They haven't admitted the pricing is wrong. They have TEMPORARILY lowered the price in the hopes that people shut the hell up about it and get it out of the mainstream news. Same goes with the 5K Display. How convenient. They've lowered the price on items that you can't even use for another 3 to 5 weeks. By the time the MBPro actually ships, the price on these adapters and the 5K Display will go back up. Reply Simon   2016-11-05 04:35 So what can be inferred form this surprising move? Only days ago their propagandists were trying to spread this claim that early order numbers had been awesome like never before. Had the uptake indeed been that astronomical, would Apple leadership be willing to give up one cent of profit from all these de facto required adapters? A guess would be orders are either low or they're worried they won't be selling enough new MBPs with all the bad press they're getting - much of which is related to the many dongles required and their ludicrous pricing. Reply Simon   2016-11-05 04:32 It's also interesting to see they were forced to do this in connection with the new MacBook Pro. This is the segment where there are a lot of pro users. People using their Macs for actual work, where productivity counts. People who are knowledgable about performance and technlology. People you can't just sway by releasing a fancy feel good campaign celebrating a new pink or gold color. It seems they're a bit drunk with their success in selling expensive status symbols to teenagers in China. I'm surprised they obviously didn't realize they cannot sell to the pro crowd like they do to those people. Reply George Wade  2016-11-05 12:12 OTOH – foreseeing the problem requires a certain amount of guesswork; while just going ahead with delivery of the product results in marketplace demand for what is actually needed in the way of adapters, accessories and cables. Do we demand that Apple use Artificial Intelligence to get a better match ! Reply Adam Engst   2016-11-06 10:36 Determining that people would be unhappy about not being able to use any existing peripherals without buying extra dongles doesn't take an advanced degree. :-) Reply Scott M.   2016-11-08 03:05 Especially considering they did realize that people were going to be pissed about the lack of a headphone jack on the iPhone 7 and thus smartly included an adapter in the box with the iPhone 7 rather than nickel and diming people by forcing them to buy that adapter. I supposed, however, that it could be argued that Apple had advanced warning since the idea of Apple killing the headphone jack had been "leaked" for at least a year before the iPhone 7 was released. Thus, Apple could not avoid hearing all the people complaining about the killing of the headphone jack before they actually did it. There was no such "advanced warning" for the all USB-C fiasco for Apple, at least as far as I can tell (I don't watch all the Apple rumors and such like you might...I only saw one article that suggested it might be possible, but not that it was really a leak). One would think, however, that there is one senior/high level executive (any lower level drone likely would be ignored/steamrolled) that should have been able to put two coherent thoughts together to extrapolate that there might be a similar reaction to having to buy a "dongle" in order to use a run of the mill USB device with their new top of the line "Pro" laptop as there was to the idea of buy a "dongle" to use with their expensive headphones for a new iPhone. But, then maybe I am expecting too much of Apple senior executives these days. And their "sale" on "dongles" does not help their image too much in my opinion. As someone else said, it kind of smacks of "here, have a discount...now we hope everyone will forget about it and we can go back to nickel and diming you". To me, the smart thing would have to just give all purchasers of new MacBook Pros (with the USB-C ports) at least 1 free USB-C to USB-A "dongle" with their order. Either just add it to the order for free automatically or included it in the box (after all, most of the new MBPs have not shipped yet). And for anyone who already got it, just ship them a free one (or refund them the full price if they ordered one). After all, while not every one needs Ethernet or used an external monitor or needs a Firewire "dongle", etc, I would argue that the vast majority of people at least use a flash drive or external drive or even use a USB printer. So, I would expect the vast majority of people make use of at least one USB-A device on a regular basis. Of all the "miscues" that I believe they made with the new MBPs, this was the most unforgivable. And I even put this above Jony Ive's infatuation with form over function and his incessant need to make all Apple devices thinner just for that sake of making them thinner and sexier (I will stop there before I get my "rant on"). Reply Dennis B. Swaney  2016-11-07 19:56 Those dongles are still excessively overpriced: none should cost more than $4.99 which would still give Apple several 100s percent profit. Reply Brian S   2016-11-07 20:22 I'm curious why Apple dropped the monitor prices. It doesn't appear related to the dongle fiasco. Reply Steve L'Heureux  2016-11-07 20:53 I have to say I feel Apple is entirely out of touch with it's older users. I'm 60 and have been with them since 1989. With as much as they charge for their gear, to keep Nickle and Diming us after they keep changing ports year after year is Fu**king pissing me off. I'm disgusted. I'm steering my clients to buy the older refurbs right now. Is it time for Phil Schiller to retire? Who the hell is driving the Apple Bus right now anyway??!! I have to think Steve J would be turning over in his grave right now. Geez, Apple is now even ceding control to Graphics creation to Microsoft with it's Surface Pro!! WTF??!! Who the hell is minding the Store??! Mr. Cook, are you paying attention????? Reply Curtis Wilcox   2016-11-08 17:34 What do you mean, changing ports year-after-year? Before USB-C, what was the last change to a Mac connector? I think it was MagSafe 2 replacing MagSafe and that was four years ago, not that recently. That's also when MBPs dropped built-in Ethernet, which I do miss (I don't miss the optical drive). Replacing USB 2 with USB 3, no downside. Replacing Thunderbolt with Thunderbolt 2, no downside. Replacing Mini DisplayPort with Thunderbolt, no downside. Roughly eight years ago, Mini DisplayPort replaced all their other video connectors, pretty much guaranteeing you'd need a dongle to connect to an external display (until they added HDMI to MBPs). But it also cleared out the mish-mash of different connectors on different models; they had DVI, Mini-DVI, and Micro-DVI on different laptop models all in the same time frame! Mini DisplayPort didn't eliminate "dongle hell" but it did make it more sane. Steve Jobs is the one who dropped all preceding connectors in favor of USB (for which there was not much adoption yet) and floppy drives on the original iMac, his is not a name to invoke when criticizing the forward-looking decision to go all-in on Thunderbolt 3/USB-C. Reply Openreels   2016-11-07 23:23 Nothing new here, Apple's been changing interfaces on us for decades! At least when they introduced TBolt as THE ONE interface they also had a display with breakouts built in. Unfortunately it took quite some time for 3rd parties to bring out alternatives that were badly needed. That could happen again, but at least USB-C has big potential for the long-term (assuming anyone can understand it). Guess I don't need to keep the old ADC video adapter cable any longer, or that crazy non-standard power cord... Reply dbrugger   2016-11-08 13:31 Price reductions don't make it. Put back what you took off so I don't need the adaptors. Then Apple will have made it right. Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc  2016-11-09 15:28 The price of dongles is probably a side show for Apple. And, though I was surprised by the port configuration of the new MacBook Pro, I think there is method to their madness. They no longer have to worry about which ports to include in their ever slimming laptops. The simple fact is that Thunderbolt 3/USB-C will serve every currently popular port, from video through USB to Thunderbolt, FireWire and Ethernet—and memory card readers. Not only that, you can charge external devices or the Mac itself from any of the ports, though I suspect there are some unspoken caveats on that score. With the right adaptor (or hub) you can connect any legacy tech you own. That's quite a coup when you step back and think about it for a minute (or two). The MacBook Pro is now essentially universal. It means the customer doesn't have to worry about which model has which ports. Get a Mac and customize it as you like, with the adaptors for the ports you need. It's a new and rather shocking concept. But it will make sense in the long run. That said, as Josh suggested, Apple could have handled things better. Clearly the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing. But that's nothing new in Apple's security obsessed, vertical silo organization. In fact, it's the norm and is't only surprising when they don't muck something up. Does anyone remember how OS X 10.10 Yosemite did a face plant right out the door? Meanwhile, if they had included an adaptor with the new Macs it would inevitably have been the wrong adaptor for some people. The new meme is about you choosing the adaptors you need. A credit toward an adaptor purchase at the Apple Store might have been nice, but it would almost certainly have been too much for some people and not enough for others. I suspect consternation over the new port alignment was factored into Apple's sales projections. Though I suspect many people enthusiastically ordering a new MBP didn't realize what they were getting into. Apple undoubtedly expected flack over some of their decisions. And just as undoubtedly they expect such flack to subside as people get used to the new reality—as they always do when Apple changes things up. And they expect (or hope) that the luster and charm of the Touch Bar will balance things out a bit. But there are a lot of other questions to be answered. Almost lost in all the hoopla over ports and adaptors is the larger size and Force Touch capability of the MacBook Pro trackpad. That, too, will take some getting used to. It's too soon to tell if the new keyboard, not including the Touch Bar, will be a plus or a minus. The keyboard on the MacBook was not all that well received. Is this one like that one? And, frankly, the Apple Wireless keyboard on which I'm typing this comment is the best Mac keyboard I've ever used—and I've used them all at one time or another. It's comparable to the keyboard on most Mac laptops up till now. Then there's touch ID. Does that mean you cannot start the new MBP with a password? At least on an iPhone you have a choice in how to set it up. And just how good are those new speakers? Does it matter? We won't know till we hear them. Will the 16GB limitation on RAM be an issue? Some people think so. How can you have a "pro" computer these days with only 16GB of RAM?. This was probably a matter of heat dissipation, though there are two new low profile, supposedly quiet fans to cool thing down. There are some cool videos about the MacBook Pro on the Apple web site, http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/, along with some rah-rah explanations of all the new features, of which there are many. I think spending some time studying what Apple has to say about its new Mac will calm the jitters some people are having about it. It did so for me. Oh, and speaking of new features, taken in toto this is more than the usual evolutionary upgrade of the MacBook Pro. The RAM is faster, the system bus is faster, the CPU is faster, the NVRAM is faster, the SSD is faster. The screen is brighter with a higher gamut (color range) and better contrast. The speakers are more robust. The ports are more powerful and versatile. The Touch Bar is almost revolutionary. In other words, Apple waited until they could upgrade literally everything on the MBP. For a change they lived up to Steve's old motto: Apple will introduce no technology before its time. Let's hope this proves to be true in this case. I can't wait to try one out at my local Best Buy—especially the keyboard, which is a make or break item in my book. And, lo, I've almost reached the character limit on this post. Whoa. Reply Scott M.   2016-11-09 16:38 While I have issues with aspects the whole "dongle" thing, I do agree that the USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports are powerful and overall a good thing. Personally, I don't particularly object to "dongles". It does allow for rather flexible and powerful ports that can then be adapted to how users want/need to use them. And I don't really care that "dongles" are ugly. I am totally in the "function over form" (not that I don't appreciate a nice design). Where I do have an issue is that Apple screwed up how they handled it and the plain reality is that it might cost them some sales. In many ways, Apple could predict which "dongles" people might want or need, so there certainly are challenges to the idea of Apple providing some "dongles" in the box. I would argue that is true for most "dongle" options, but not true for at least one simple USB-C to USB-A (i.e. currently available "standard" USB port). Like a headphone jack on an iPhone, I would argue that the vast majority of MacBook Pro use on a rather regular basis a USB device. So, to me, Apple's true screw up on the "dongle" front was not including at least 1 USB-C to USB-A "dongle" with every new MacBook Pro purchase (and I would argue MacBook purchase). After all, with Apple's "here have a discount for a short period of time on these dongles sale, at least until you forget that we screwed this up" sale on "dongles", it would appear that it costs Apple $9 or less to make the USB-C to USB-A dongle (I highly doubt Apple would be will to sell them at a loss even for distraction/marketing sales in the hopes of dying down the controversy until people forget about it). So, Apple's mistake was not just eating the $9 (or less) cost of providing at least 1 USB-C to USB-A dongle with the sale of a MacBook Pro (like they did with the Lightning to headphone jack dongle with the iPhone 7). I also agree there are other aspects of the new MacBook Pro to like, but some that are still unknown (in particular the TouchBar...hard to say how useful it will really be until actually using it) and some that are not so good (such as the limit of 16 GB of RAM). I, however, will not be watching any of Apple's marketing videos. While I love Macs and will generally pick them over a Windows machines the majority of the time (except for certain situations such as a gaming computer), I can only take so much of the Apple marketing koolaid crap of "magical this" and "magical that". In the end, they are still just marketing videos that come from a very biased source (which is true of pretty much all marketing material). To that effect, I have not watched the MacBook Pro keynote and not sure if I will. I did watch the iPhone 7 event and was left rather unimpressed by the presentation. That is not to say that there were some nice upgrades/improvements to the iPhone 7 and other potentially nice new products (such as potentially the AirPods when they are finally released). What left me disappointed was essentially a 2 hour presentation that did not present enough new and innovative stuff to deserve a 2 hour presentation. It came across too much as a self-congradulatory marathon of "magic this" and "magic that"...AND most of it was not magic in my opinion. In the end, I just think that Apple has let itself get trapped in a self-absorbed and self-congradulatory bubble. Yes, they make excellent products that I prefer to use...most of the time...but they have gotten too caught up in their own marketing hype too often. But that is just me.

Shoppers will be hoping for dramatic discounts across a wide range of items, most notably consumer tech and electronics including laptops, televisions and gaming consoles. In terms of what will be up for sales, previous generations models often see the most dramatic discounts, and this year we're expecting deals on Macbooks, iMacs, iPhones, iPads, Apple watches and Apple TVs. Apple products rarely ever undergo price reductions, with people resigned to paying full price for the highly sought-after tech. Last year, the company didn't participate in the mayhem so their staff weren't expected to work such hectic long hours. Therefore, the trick to finding Apple Black Friday deals is knowing where to look — and that's anywhere but the Apple Store. Read More When is Black Friday 2016? Deals predictions, stores to watch and shopping tips ahead of the huge November blow out Which retailer's should I stalk? Major players like Curry's and Amazon should be your first port of call. Likewise Argos, John Lewis, eBay and laptop specialists like LaptopsDirect are also worth browsing during Black Friday. If you're after a cheap Apple phone head to Carphone Warehouse. Many retailers will drip feed deals so keep your eyes peeled - Apple products will be snapped up fast. Current Apple deals We will be updating this page will deals as they're announced so check back for the latest news and offers. Read More Apple deals MacBook Pro iPad Mini MacBook Air iPads Top Black Friday 2016 Apple deals - Ironically, don't expect any Black Friday deals to appear at the actual Apple Store. Other retailers such as John Lewis and Currys will have the best (and only) discounts on Apple products. - Previous generation iPhones are expected to be heavily discounted due to the release of the iPhone 7. Make sure you look at the amount of memory in the iPhone 6s. - After an Apple Watch? Pay attention to whether its the original or the Series 1 as the former has a slower processor (which shops are unlikely to note). - For the best iPad discounts, we suggest investigating deals for the iPad Air 2. Shopping for tech: Dos and Don'ts Whilst we can predict that there are going to be lots of amazing tech deals to be had on Black Friday, it's worth pointing out that not everything will be the good deal that it sounds. So Vouchercloud compiled a list of tips for buying tech this Black Friday: 1. Focus your efforts Create a list of tech items you need or want and don’t stray from it! Big brands often offer package deals on Black Friday and whilst it seems like a good investment at the time, you might be stuck with added extras you'll never use! This will also mean you’re less likely to overspend. 2. Set a budget and stick to it We all know how easy it is to get carried away with spending when it comes to buying the latest gadgets and gizmos. It doesn't matter if you’re buying a Fitbit, iPhone or home entertainment system, set yourself a clear and defined budget... And stick to it! It’s easy to think that spending an extra £50 won’t matter too much but it can all add up if you break the budget on a number of items - remember Christmas is just around the corner! 3. Do your research Most brands will start to announce their discounts before they go live on Black Friday, so try and take a look online or in store before the date and consider the products you’re interested in buying. Always look around for voucher codes on sites such as vouchercloud.com and HotDeals.com and extra discounts before buying a product online too. 4. Use tech to buy tech There is no shame in using your existing tech items to buy more tech - we’ve all done it! You can use your existing phone or tablet to download branded apps such as Amazon as they will have will have dedicated Black Friday tech landing pages so you can scan through deals quickly on the day. 5. Check if the product is the latest version Many of the ‘deals’ you’ll see on Black Friday are a previous gen or they may be poorer quality products that the retailer wants to clear from their stores! It doesn’t mean they’re not worth the investment, but it’s worth checking the specification against recent devices just in case. 6. Deals last the whole weekend Panic normally sets in and most people will try and purchase all of their tech goods on the Friday, but remember that deals will nearly always last the whole weekend. It’s also worth considering that whilst Black Friday and Cyber Monday are huge events in the retail calendar, there are other sales events throughout the year such as Amazon Prime Day. If you don’t get your tech bargain on the Friday - it might be reduced further later in the year. 7. Pay securely If you’re shopping online for tech items, be sure to use a credit card or Paypal. If you do use a credit card, use one that offers you rewards such as air miles or vouchers for money off your shopping to save even further. Looking for something specific? If you're dreaming of an Apple iPad, or want to replace your laptop with an Apple MacBook, now is your chance. Bag yourself some cheap Apple goods this November 25th a.k.a Black Friday.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 11, 2016 at 9:22PM Over on Seeking Alpha, contributor Black Coral Research recently argued that were Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to transition away from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) processors in its Mac line of computers, contract chip manufacturer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) would be a big winner. Apple MacBook Pro computers. Image source: Apple.  "TSMC is benefiting from the halo effect of solid iPhone 7 sales, but its real potential is when Apple decides to design its own silicon for its Mac," the contributor writes. "We estimate that TSMC could generate $5.5 billion in annual revenues from such a venture, leading to 20% revenue and earnings growth." This analysis doesn't stand up to scrutiny. Here's why. The current Mac supplier doesn't even generate that much The biggest problem with this analysis is that it assumes that TSMC will be able to charge Apple a whopping $300 per chip for Apple-designed Mac processors. This is absurd, because this would imply that TSMC would make significantly more from building each Apple-designed Mac processor than current Mac processor provider Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) makes on average from the chips it sells Apple. A quick way to "prove" this assertion is as follows: Apple ships roughly 20 million Mac computers each year, give or take a few million. If Intel sold processors to Apple at an average of $300 apiece, then Intel would generate roughly $6 billion per year in revenue from Apple. Per Intel's form 10-K filings for 2013, 2014, and 2015, Apple wasn't responsible for at least 10% of Intel's revenues in those years. In those years, Intel's revenue was solidly south of $60 billion, so we know that Apple pays much less than $300 for Intel processors on average. Further, even if Intel did take in that much per chip from Apple, Apple's per-unit costs would be lower for Apple-designed chips manufactured by a third party, since the third party isn't getting paid for the chip design. The iPhone opportunity is much larger than the Mac opportunity The Seeking Alpha post suggests that TSMC would have a bigger opportunity to profit from Apple's building an in-house Mac processor than it does from having a monopoly on the iPhone 7 A-series processor business -- as well as the A8, A8X, and A9X chips that currently power the iPad. That doesn't make sense. In Apple's last fiscal year, it shipped nearly 212 million iPhones and 45.59 million iPads. It shipped just 18.484 million Macs in that period. In terms of chip area, and therefore chip dollar content to TSMC, an Intel processor isn't much larger than a high-end iPhone or iPad processor. The A10 Fusion measures in at 125 square millimeters in TSMC's 16-nanometer process; the A9X comes in at 147 square millimeters. These are already large, high-silicon and thus high-dollar content chips to TSMC. Even if we assume Intel's average content across Apple's Mac lineup is twice that found in an iPad processor, TSMC's winning the Apple business over from Intel would amount to the addition of roughly 36 million iPad processors' worth of revenue. In TSMC's 2015 form 10-F filing, the company said its two largest customers, one of which is almost certainly Apple, each made up 16% of its total revenue in 2015. That means TSMC's Apple-related revenue in 2015 -- consisting of A8, A8X, and some A9 chip sales -- was around $4.12 billion. It's unlikely that approximately 18 million Mac processors could generate anywhere close to the kind of revenue for TSMC as all those other chips do combined. Indeed, even if TSMC can capture around $50 per chip for a potential Apple-designed Mac processor -- which is probably too high of an estimate -- then this would amount to annual revenue of less than $1 billion per year for TSMC. As TSMC's annual revenue approaches $30 billion, even $1 billion in incremental revenue would be good for only around 3.33% growth. That'd be good business, but hardly a game changer for the chipmaker. Indeed, capturing 100% of the A10 Fusion chip orders for the iPhone 7-series phones, up from a reportedly minority allocation for the A9 processors in the iPhone 6s-series phones, was probably a bigger deal to TSMC than a potential Mac win ever could be.

The 21.5-inch UltraFine 4K Display went up for pre-order at the same time as the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar. At the time, deliveries were estimated to arrive on November 15 at the earliest. Current delivery estimates are quoted at 5 to 6 weeks. Apple debuted the UltraFine Display at its MacBook Pro event last month in 4K and 5K variations. While the 4K display has been available for pre-order since the event, the 5K display is not yet available. The Cupertino company said it partnered with LG to develop the displays specifically for the new MacBook Pro, with Apple making sure that the displays are optimized for its products. Shortly after announcing the displays, Apple confirmed it was out of the standalone display business. The 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar can power either one 5K UltraFine display or two 4K UltraFine displays, while the 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar can power either two 5K displays or four 4K displays. Additionally, both displays include three downstream USB-C ports and can charge a MacBook Pro over the same cable that carries the video and data signals. In early November, Apple dropped the prices of both displays in an effort to smooth the transition for new MacBook Pro owners. The move was combined with price drops for all of Apple's USB-C adapters. The 27-inch 5K UltraFine display is now $974, a $325 price cut from the original price of $1,299. The 4K UltraFine display is now $524, a $175 price cut from the original price of $699. The lowered prices are only available until the end of the year.

The rear Power plus is in odd location off-center so cable drops down side versus behind the support pole. The thick tick support tube and ugly base. And the cheap plastic. So much for caring about the environment. Clearly this deal was last minute by Apple and rushed by LG. It's why there are no pre-orders. it's still in the labs. I just hope there aren't quality issues due to the rush. Apple needs to remember pros care about the aesthetic of their environment. They should have insisted on a better case, or even better, had Jon's team design something. My dream is LG fixes the case and we see a new form factor before launch. I'll buy two if they clean up the form factor. It shows that it is all about the $ now completely. At apple, does anyone use and external monitor? Would these monitors line up Apples "all Apple" type of ecosystem, especially in their Campus? Apple use to be into the "look" of things and everything being in synergy. They made apple brand mouses, keyboards etc. just so everything is in synergy for the inclusive experience. They use to make the products for themselves (or at least that is what they use to say). Jony is all about design over form which is ok (that is what he prefers). Because they cannot get their margins on a monitor they stop making a monitor?, that sounds more like a company that is solely "bean counting" which now the New Apple (its ok I guess - it made them where they are today). Again, like I have said before, if a company's vision is that, it is ok (as most have to be to stay in business) but apple does not need to operate now like this. It shows that management does not use their products much besides for just photos of their grandkids, surfing the internet and "bean counting" spread sheets (probably now use Excel). I suspect that they only use an iPhone and the the new underpowered MacBook because that is all they need. I would love to know what tech gear they actually now use personally. When Steve Jobs worked with Pixar the Mac Pro was important...why? because he was hanging around those that do creative stuff and wanted them to use Apple stuff. When watching "Toy Story" being created, he probably hated to watch it on a windows XP machine or a Dell or Samsung (ugly at the time) monitor. The Cinema Display was born with the all black edge, giving it a "Cinema feel"...thus the name. With an Apple silver on Black logo on the bottom middle while "His" collaborated movie creation seen above. A beautiful thing... (My thoughts of course). I own the expensive thunderbolt monitor and before the Cinema monitor also. Now...ugly experience... The Mac Pro and the Mini excelled when Jobs was around because....he hung around creative content developers who said, This is what we need to do your dreams Steve (i.e. animation stuff). So..Mac Pro had to be a power house to process animation and video...and a Apple monitor to be seen on so it did not drive jobs crazy seeing his creation on nothing less... Now...sigh....

Designed for all new Apple products, the WySky Music Light is a one stop shop for playing music, charging your phone, and setting the mood all at the same time. "As music lovers, we've always loved speaker systems that plug directly into your phone while it charges, but we thought something was missing." says founder Jeff Wu. "When you listen to music, so much of the pleasure and the experience depends on mood and lighting. So we wanted to combine the sound of music with the ambient lighting of the room, all in a single device. It's a great way to unwind during dinner, at a party, or with a book or a partner after a long day." Most lamps have a set color -- either warm white light, cold white light, or a colored light. WySky is the first lamp that allows you to blend any color together, which means you can choose the precise shade and color that is best suited to your room or mood. The lamp is fully integrated with iOS 10 (iOS 6.1 and newer), is MFi-approved by Apple, and works with iPhone, iPad, and iPod. The team has gone through several iterations of this product to be able to provide the highest quality sound and light. It includes a 4 inch full-range speaker to fill the room with hi-definition audio and 81 LEDs that won't burn out or get hot to the touch, and a software interface which allows for selection within a 16 million color spectrum. The WySky Music Lamp is designed to complement and enhance a mindful lifestyle. It was inspired by the founders' love of music, design, Apple products, and having a quiet and beautiful space to relax every single day. In exchange for pledging to the project, backers can choose from five different styles of varying colors, starting at $99. Each lamp comes will the full range of lighting options, an alarm clock feature, and a 4" full range speaker. Backers have until Wednesday, November 23rd to pre-order and can expect to receive their Music Lamps in January 2017.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 11, 2016 at 9:22PM Over on Seeking Alpha, contributor Black Coral Research recently argued that were Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to transition away from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) processors in its Mac line of computers, contract chip manufacturer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) would be a big winner. Apple MacBook Pro computers. Image source: Apple.  "TSMC is benefiting from the halo effect of solid iPhone 7 sales, but its real potential is when Apple decides to design its own silicon for its Mac," the contributor writes. "We estimate that TSMC could generate $5.5 billion in annual revenues from such a venture, leading to 20% revenue and earnings growth." This analysis doesn't stand up to scrutiny. Here's why. The current Mac supplier doesn't even generate that much The biggest problem with this analysis is that it assumes that TSMC will be able to charge Apple a whopping $300 per chip for Apple-designed Mac processors. This is absurd, because this would imply that TSMC would make significantly more from building each Apple-designed Mac processor than current Mac processor provider Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) makes on average from the chips it sells Apple. A quick way to "prove" this assertion is as follows: Apple ships roughly 20 million Mac computers each year, give or take a few million. If Intel sold processors to Apple at an average of $300 apiece, then Intel would generate roughly $6 billion per year in revenue from Apple. Per Intel's form 10-K filings for 2013, 2014, and 2015, Apple wasn't responsible for at least 10% of Intel's revenues in those years. In those years, Intel's revenue was solidly south of $60 billion, so we know that Apple pays much less than $300 for Intel processors on average. Further, even if Intel did take in that much per chip from Apple, Apple's per-unit costs would be lower for Apple-designed chips manufactured by a third party, since the third party isn't getting paid for the chip design. The iPhone opportunity is much larger than the Mac opportunity The Seeking Alpha post suggests that TSMC would have a bigger opportunity to profit from Apple's building an in-house Mac processor than it does from having a monopoly on the iPhone 7 A-series processor business -- as well as the A8, A8X, and A9X chips that currently power the iPad. That doesn't make sense. In Apple's last fiscal year, it shipped nearly 212 million iPhones and 45.59 million iPads. It shipped just 18.484 million Macs in that period. In terms of chip area, and therefore chip dollar content to TSMC, an Intel processor isn't much larger than a high-end iPhone or iPad processor. The A10 Fusion measures in at 125 square millimeters in TSMC's 16-nanometer process; the A9X comes in at 147 square millimeters. These are already large, high-silicon and thus high-dollar content chips to TSMC. Even if we assume Intel's average content across Apple's Mac lineup is twice that found in an iPad processor, TSMC's winning the Apple business over from Intel would amount to the addition of roughly 36 million iPad processors' worth of revenue. In TSMC's 2015 form 10-F filing, the company said its two largest customers, one of which is almost certainly Apple, each made up 16% of its total revenue in 2015. That means TSMC's Apple-related revenue in 2015 -- consisting of A8, A8X, and some A9 chip sales -- was around $4.12 billion. It's unlikely that approximately 18 million Mac processors could generate anywhere close to the kind of revenue for TSMC as all those other chips do combined. Indeed, even if TSMC can capture around $50 per chip for a potential Apple-designed Mac processor -- which is probably too high of an estimate -- then this would amount to annual revenue of less than $1 billion per year for TSMC. As TSMC's annual revenue approaches $30 billion, even $1 billion in incremental revenue would be good for only around 3.33% growth. That'd be good business, but hardly a game changer for the chipmaker. Indeed, capturing 100% of the A10 Fusion chip orders for the iPhone 7-series phones, up from a reportedly minority allocation for the A9 processors in the iPhone 6s-series phones, was probably a bigger deal to TSMC than a potential Mac win ever could be.

Log in Sign up Login with Facebook Login with Google Go Advanced News Reviews Phones Home News Blog Reviews Comments (18) Post your comment Standalone Apple Support app is launching for iOS 11 November 2016 Apple is currently rolling out a new app for iOS devices. It's called Apple Support and should be available soon in all countries through the App Store. For now, it only shows up in the store for the Netherlands, but that's clearly just a temporary thing. The rollout to other territories might be taking a few days though. The standalone Apple Support app groups everything that's support-related into one place. Its homepage lists your existing Apple devices, including detailed model information. It also offers some featured "How To" articles, which should be tailored to the products you own. The app lets you chat with customer support reps, and schedule visits to physical Apple Stores for repairs. It contains a History section where all of your support queries are listed. Genius Bar appointments can be scheduled through the Apple Store app too, and Apple also has a Tips app that launched with iOS 8 to give you quick feature tutorials, but the new Apple Support app brings all of these things together rather neatly. Hopefully it will become available across the world soon. Source Share Facebook Twitter © 2000-2016 GSMArena.com All brands | Privacy | Terms | Contact us Desktop version

(Google) I always thought Google was missing out on a great opportunity in not having its own phone to take advantage of its Android operating system. Apple learned early on that controlling entire hardware and software systems was the way to go, but Google seemed content to just work on the software end. Sure, there were a few forgettable Google-branded Nexus phones, but they were far from the best Android handsets. Now Google has decided to dive in head-first and design its own phones, the Google Pixel and Pixel XL. HTC is building the phones, but the design is all Google’s. Let’s get one thing out of the way first – Google’s Pixel looks like an iPhone. That’s not necessarily a bad thing. Apple has sold millions of iPhones, and the design and look are proven hits. But even though it looks like an iPhone and costs the same as the iPhone (starting at $650), there are hardware differences that are worth mentioning. HARDWARE AND SPECS I’ve been using the non-XL Pixel for the last few weeks, so my hands-on thoughts will focus on the smaller version. The Pixel is built around a 5-inch AMOLED screen made from Corning Gorilla Glass 4 with a resolution of 1920 by 1080 pixels (441 pixels per inch). It runs a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 quad-core processor with four gigabytes of RAM and ships with 32 gigabytes or 128 gigabytes of storage. The sleep-wake button is high on the right edge, but the volume rocker button is also on the right. This put all the buttons comfortably under your thumb (if you’re right-handed). The big difference in the Pixel’s design is the placement of the fingerprint sensor on the phone’s back, which happens to be exactly where my index finger rests when I’m holding the phone. Putting the fingerprint reader on the back isn’t really better or worse than the iPhone’s front placement – it’s a matter of taste. Because the Pixel chose the back, I have to pick up the phone to unlock it with my finger. I do find I keep my iPhone lying on my desk, so I am able to just touch my finger to the reader without picking up the phone to check a message or text. The body is made of aluminum, but the top third of the phone’s backside is also glass. The main camera has a 12-megapixel sensor and an f/2.0 lens. The front camera has an 8-megapixel sensor with an f/2.4 lens. The camera is top-notch. The Pixel is on par with Apple’s iPhone 7 or Samsung’s Galaxy S7 Edge. I can’t say enough nice things about the camera on the Pixel. I also love invoking the camera app by a quick double flip of the phone or double tapping the sleep-wake button. Google also includes unlimited cloud storage for all photos and videos taken with the Pixel. The charger is USB-C, which seems to be where the world is headed (except for iPhones). The Pixel’s USB-C port uses the faster USB 3.0, which means much faster transfers. According to Google, 15 minutes of USB-C charging from the included 18-watt power supply will provide seven hours of power. The Pixel’s physical dimensions are 5.6 inches by 2.7 inches by 0.2 inches, and it weighs 5.04 ounces. It’s about a quarter of an inch longer than my iPhone 6s. The 2,770 ampere-hour battery easily lasted a day for my use. You’ll find the usual radios – 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.2 along with near field communication. There are a few features you won’t find on the Pixel, including water resistance and stereo speakers (there’s just one). There is no slot for adding storage, and the Pixel does not have wireless charging. ANDROID IN ALL ITS GLORY You may have used Android phones before, but you really haven’t used Android as Google intended. Different wireless carriers and phone manufacturers put their own software on top of Android, often cluttering up the landscape. The Pixel runs pure, unadulterated Android 7.1, and it’s the only phone to feature Google’s new Assistant. Simply say “OK, Google,” and you’ll invoke the Google Assistant, which will answer questions, manage tasks, find photos, entertain you and help you stay on schedule. I think Google’s Assistant is much better than Apple’s Siri. You can have an actual conversation with Assistant. I asked the Assistant how to get to a local park, and the directions from my location were displayed on a Google map. Then I asked, “When was it built?” and the Assistant brought up an article about the park and when it was built. Very cool. There are some other Android tweaks you’ll notice. I had to look up the way you call up the app list on the Pixel. With other Android phones, you’ll have an icon to bring up all the apps. On the Pixel, you swipe up from the bottom of the screen to bring up the apps. The apps are also pretty uniform in their appearance. All the included app icons are round. Third-party apps still can be shaped differently, but I like the round look. Overall the phone was very snappy and responsive. CONCLUSIONS I’m really happy Google has decided to get into the phone game. The company has the most popular operating system, and it’s about time it designed its own hardware to take advantage of it. I’m a longtime iPhone user, so I’m a sucker for the design. I’m still on the fence about the fingerprint sensor placement. There is a lot to like about the Pixel and Pixel XL. I realize this isn’t an in-depth review, but there are plenty of places online to find those. The Pixel is a hit with me, and it joins the iPhone and Samsung Galaxy 7 phones in the top tier of handsets. I can’t wait to see what Google does with the next version of the Pixel The Pixel costs $649 and the XL costs $769 for the 32gb model. Add $100 to each to increase the storage to 128gb. They are available from Google, Verizon stores or Best Buy. You might see commercials or websites that say the Pixel is a Verizon exclusive, but that’s just for sales. If you buy the Pixel through Google, it’s unlocked for use on any carrier.

His words and his example still inspires a world hungry for everything that Jobs stood for. Steve’s bodily absence is compensated in the legacy of thoughts and ideas he left this world. Steve Jobs, the father of Apple, iPhone, and iOS, was a versatile man, forever caught in the balance of enlightenment and ambition. Caught in a decision between joy and effort, he forged a way to have both. He leaves a legacy of ideas for those willing to read, listen, and learn from his example. Apple, iPhone, and iOS almost never happened. It is a little-known fact that Steve Jobs almost chose enlightenment over ambition. Read more in this Inquisitr story. If that had happened, iPhone would be nothing except perhaps an occasional typo. Steve Jobs almost decided to devote his life to spiritual questing in India. He was ready to join an Ashram, but in the end, ambition won out over enlightenment, or did it? Steve Jobs, in fact, learned to use his spiritual nature and his ambition to gift the world with a new means of innovation. Steve Jobs created iPhone, built Apple as a brilliant company, and developed iOS as a platform of infinite creative possibilities. These are the things Jobs did, but why and how are important questions to ask. Steve Jobs believed in what he was doing. Jobs believed in a formula based on feeling passion, changing the world, and breaking all the rules. How else can one individual make a mark on the world? 1. Steve Jobs Endorsed Passion Above All, As The Deciding Factor Of Success <noscript><iframe width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gxo2rGr7Yfg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> For Steve Jobs, Apple was all about Passion. Passion is the first principle of success, according to Jobs. Everything else depends on having a Jobs-level passion. Successful people do what they love, and then it is easier to continue loving what they do. Entrepreneur quoted Jobs as follows. “People with passion can change the world for the better.” Steve Jobs was quoted in DIY Genius, revealing the secrets behind Apple’s success. “People say you have to have a lot of passion for what you’re doing and it’s totally true. And the reason is because it’s so hard that if you don’t, any rational person would give up. It’s really hard. And you have to do it over a sustained period of time.” Steve Jobs felt there were two kinds of workers in this world who create two different types of work for themselves. There are those who work out of need, responsibility, and obligation, and no matter what those people do it is drudgery. Then there are those who work out of a passion for making everything better with their efforts. Those people excel while the others fail or barely hang on. “So if you don’t love it, if you’re not having fun doing it, you don’t really love it, you’re going to give up. And that’s what happens to most people, actually. If you really look at the ones that ended up, you know, being ‘successful’ in the eyes of society and the ones that didn’t, oftentimes, it’s the ones who were successful loved what they did so they could persevere when it got really tough.” Steve Jobs felt so strongly about this that he suggested prospective entrepreneurs without passion take a menial ordinary job to gain experience until passion struck them with a calling in life, one that would fuel their real ambitions. Without true passion and only a sense of duty and drudgery, entrepreneurship will always fail, and so will any but the most menial and rudimentary of jobs. According to Apple founder Steve Jobs, people just have the wrong idea about working. They think they are supposed to hate it, to get tired of it and take time off, without even giving it a thought during the time they are away. They are supposed to compartmentalize their job definition and keep it separate from their real life. That’s not how it works for successful people. It takes passion. “A good answer to the question ‘What time do you leave work?’ is to say, ‘Never, since my work is my passion.’ But it takes a genius to continue by saying, ‘And by the way, my passion is design.'” Finally, the Apple guru advises to always follow your heart, according to Clickhole. “Whatever you do, you must never let the voice in your head control the brain in your heart.” 2. Steve Jobs On Changing The World <noscript><iframe width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gO6cFMRqXqU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> Steve Jobs, the father of Apple and creator of the iPhone, once told John Sculley, then president of Pepsi Cola Company, that he needed a bigger vision for change, according to Entrepreneur. “Do you want to spend your life selling sugar water or do you want to change the world?” Apple had one purpose in Steve Jobs’ mind. To change the world. He wanted to make life better for everyone. He was an innovator who always wanted a brighter future and what was best for the world. So how can just anyone make a difference? Steve Jobs would tell people to dream bigger, and get the message of your dream out there so people can understand it. They want to know what the Apple iPhone, for example, can do for them. They don’t usually care about all the technical stuff the company did. They want to know what the product, service, or idea does for them. Therefore, Steve Jobs believed in designing in a way that improved lives. From the beginning of the creative process to the end of the sale and beyond to customer service, it has to be about what people need. Good ideas are about benefiting others, not just making money. Of course, Steve Jobs cared about money. Sure he had to eat, just like everyone else. He provided rather well for himself by anyone’s definition, but he knew when he went into business that the customers don’t buy because of the CEO’s needs or the employee’s needs. Apple customers buy iPhones, iPads, and etc. because the products being offered meet their needs. Therefore, the customers need comes first, and in the end, it is all about making the world better for those customers. It is really all about a universal spiritual principle of putting others first, but that principle works very well in business. 3. Steve Jobs On Breaking The Rules <noscript><iframe width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8rwsuXHA7RA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> Apple founder Steve Jobs seemed to be born hating the status quo, and loving the troublemakers. Jobs was quoted from an iconic Apple commercial seen in the video above. “Here’s to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They’re not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing, you can’t do is ignore them.” Then Steve Jobs went on to explain why. This bit of advertising explains another secret of success. “Because they change things. They push the human race forward. While some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.” Apple founder Steve Jobs encouraged crime, not the type that breaks laws or hurts people, but he definitely thought the world was full of rules to be broken. “Be a criminal. Commit crimes. I’m not talking about crimes against the law. Those aren’t the important ones. You can commit a crime against boredom. Or a crime against ignorance. Commit crimes against bad ideas, and against the people who have them. Then go commit crimes for innovation and for design. Above all, realize that the product itself isn’t the product. The crime is the product.” Steve Jobs was pointing out there are many ways to do things, and those blind enough to believe that only one way is the right way are the real menace to society. Innovation dictates there is always a better way, but sometimes that means breaking rules and traditions that keep all mankind in a rut. 4. Steve Jobs On Being Prepared To Fail And Fail Big Steve Jobs is responsible for fonts on computers, iPhones, iPods and iPads [Image by Anton Ivanov/Shutterstock] Apple founder Steve Jobs recognized that fear of failure is paralyzing. It keeps people from doing anything, right or wrong. People cannot be so afraid to make mistakes they fail because they don’t act. Refusal to take action is a guarantee of failure. “Most people never pick up the phone and call, most people never ask, that’s what separates the people that do things from the people who just dream about them. You’ve got to act. You’ve got to be willing to fail. You’ve got to be willing to crash and burn.” The willingness to move forward, even if an attempt fails, is part of business. Of course, there are times when one can’t afford to fail, that is where “no” comes in. For all his positivity, Steve Jobs believed in the power of saying no to bad ideas, but he also believed in saying yes to the right idea at the right time. Making a strong move, without hesitation, is part of the path to success. 5. Steve Jobs On Design Apple logo as design [Image by Kena Betancur/Shutterstock] The most important word in the world to Steve Jobs was design, but he never, ever meant appearance. To Jobs, everything was part of design. One idea would flow into another based on a tremendous base of everyday experiences that were all material for design. “Most people make the mistake of thinking design is what it looks like. People think it’s this veneer — that the designers are handed this box and told, ‘Make it look good!’ That’s not what we think design is. It’s not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.” Apple was always largely about design. iPhones are not all that different on the outside, and one might think, what design, but the design of what it does is simply amazing. The form gives way to function as design. RELATED REPORTS FROM THE INQUISITR How iPhone, Apple, And iOS Almost Never Happened: Steve Jobs’ Quest For Enlightenment Vs.

Amaturo More On: new york giants Giants' offensive-line revolving door is getting ridiculous How Conor McGregor pushed Odell Beckham to another level Giants defense goes in time machine in 4th-quarter onslaught McAdoo made the Eli Manning gamble that Coughlin craves Eight games into his NFL career, and Eli Apple has already run the gamut. He’s played a key role in the Giants’ 5-3 start, and he’s also been benched. He’s missed two games with hamstring and groin injuries, and had to deal with an off-the-field issue involving his outspoken mother’s criticism of the team’s questionable handling of the Josh Brown domestic abuse case. “It’s been up and down, injuries and all,” the Giants first-round pick from Ohio State said Friday, and also added this: “I don’t deal with more than any ordinary guy that plays in the NFL deals with.” After he was pulled in Sunday’s victory over the Eagles, Apple owned it. He was asked if his mother’s two columns on SI.com ripping the Giants and owner John Mara had been a distraction, suggesting they had leaned on her son to quiet her. He said no then, and reiterated the stance on Friday. “Everything’s normal,” said the 21-year-old Apple, who still lives with his mother, Annie, in southern New Jersey. SEE ALSO Eli Apple: My mom's wrong, Giants never pressured me :0 No, the Giants did not pressure Eli Apple, their rookie... Eli Apple: My mom's wrong, Giants never pressured me Of particular importance, the Giants are happy with how Apple has responded to getting pulled. Coach Ben McAdoo said “he’s back in the fold,” and defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo raved about the rookie’s week of practice and said, “No one has lost confidence in Eli.” His role will go back to normal, as a starting outside cornerback, when the Giants host the Bengals on Monday night at MetLife Stadium. “I am a big Eli Apple fan. I have said that from the beginning,” Spagnuolo said. “He is going to help us win football games. He has.” Against the Eagles, Spagnuolo said initially the plan was for him to just sit out a series early in the second half after missing a few tackles and getting beaten for a touchdown, but his replacement, Trevin Wade, played so well, they opted not to bring Apple back in. While the injuries have only cost him two games, they have limited his practice time, which has had an adverse effect. “He hasn’t built [up] the calluses to get through a season like this, so he is struggling a little bit with that,” the defensive coordinator said. “But he is going to be fine. He is on the rise.” In the past, when he’s had bad games, Apple said he has made sure to be extra focused during the week leading up to the next game, taking extra notes, watching more film, spending more time talking to teammates and coaches. “I try to be a little more attentive on things,” he said. “Just try to get comfortable, because if you’re comfortable out there, everything is going to come to you, and you’re just going to start making plays. That’s what I’m trying to get back to. “I feel like I have a great opportunity for this last half of the season to really get back on track, and do what I can to help the defense be the best defense we can be.” Apple credited multiple Giants defensive players with talking to him Sunday, during and after the victory. Strong safety Landon Collins was at the top of the list. The overwhelming message: Don’t doubt yourself. Everyone gets benched sometimes. “They were in my ear, letting me know they still got my back,” he said. The coaching staff has sent a similar message by throwing him back in the fire. Apple is excited to atone for his mistakes, especially playing on Monday night for the first time. “You want to make a great impression. It’s a big game for all of us. It’s another big stage,” Apple said. “It’s going to be an electric atmosphere out there. I’ve never been in MetLife when it’s a night game. Everything is going to be a little amplified. That’s when guys really pick up their games.” The Giants are counting on it from their rookie cornerback.

Read more about the stories in today's news: Apple Refurbished iPhones Again Being Offered in the Apple Store Google Pulling the Plug on Free Map Maker Tool SAP Releases Revamped HANA Database Nov. 30 AMD Targets Gaming, VR with New Radeon GPUs       Today's topics include the return of refurbished iPhones return to the Apple store, Google's decision to retire community edits on its Maps application, SAP's report that it will soon release HANA 2, a revamped version of its in-memory database and AMD's plan to target content creators with new Radeon graphics cards. After an extended absence, Apple is again offering refurbished iPhone models at discounted prices through the online Apple Store o buyers who want a refurbished device that comes with a standard one-year Apple warranty. The refurbished iPhones began showing up recently on the Apple website, with discounts ranging from about $80 to $110, or about 15 percent below retail prices. The last time Apple sold refurbished iPhones appears to be in 2007. Google has decided to pull the plug on its free Map Maker tool that people have used for more than eight years to make community edits to Google Maps. The company will formally retire Map Maker as a stand-alone product in March 2017 and integrate its features directly into Maps. Doing so will allow Google to focus on enabling the best editing and moderation capabilities right within the desktop and mobile versions of Maps, the company announced. Google will continue to roll out new features and update existing ones so the user community can continue to contribute to Maps. But there will no longer be a separate stand-alone tool for doing it. Back in December 2010, SAP re-invigorated its entire business with the introduction of the HANA (high-performance analytic appliance) in-memory database. Since then, it has grown into an almost-$2 billion business for the German software company, and prospects continue to look good for sales going into 2017. At its SAP TechEd Conference Nov. 8 in Barcelona, the company announced that it soon will release a new version of the speedy database, SAP HANA 2, which includes new features and enhancements involving database management, data management, analytical intelligence and application development. Advanced Micro Devices is targeting content creators in such areas as gaming and virtual reality with the latest high-end graphics cards for workstations and similar systems. AMD officials this week announced that the Radeon Pro WX Series of professional graphics cards, which are based on the company's 14-nanometer Polaris architecture, are available. They will address the demands rising from such trends as real-time gaming engines, virtual reality (VR), low-overhead APIs—such as DirectX 12 and Vulkan—and open-source tools and applications. GPUs are a key part of AMD's larger effort to grow its fortunes, allowing the chip maker to compete with Nvidia in a range of growth areas, including gaming, immersive computing and VR.       Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

Could Look Like Under President Trump The president-elect already has a tumultuous relationship with Apple -- but that might not mean much in the end. Chris Neiger (TMFNewsie) Nov 11, 2016 at 5:24PM Image source: Getty Images. The dust is still settling from the surprising election of Donald Trump to the U.S. presidency. Markets tanked on the uncertainty of having Trump in the Oval Office, though they have since begun to bounce back. However, investors are still wondering what Trump's policies could mean for their investments, and that's particularly true for companies Trump singled out specifically during his campaign.  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) took several jabs from Trump over the past year, and there are a few policies that could directly affect the company. It's worth noting that Trump reportedly holds millions of Apple shares, so any of the following proposals would directly impact his portfolio as well. Let's take a look at two key proposals and why Apple is likely to remain steady under President-elect Trump. Persuading Apple to make more products in the U.S. Trump said at the same campaign rally where he called for an Apple boycott (over Apple's refusal to unlock an iPhone for the FBI) that he wants the company to bring its manufacturing out of China and into the U.S. Trump said, "I want to see the day when Apple makes its products on our land. We're going to bring our jobs back to this country." That's not all that unique of a proposal, though Trump has taken it a bit further by saying he would force jobs to come back to the U.S. by proposing high tariffs on imported consumer goods (which Wired points out would be virtually impossible to pull off). Apple jobs were actually brought up in the 2012 campaign election as well. And when President Obama met with Silicon Valley leaders in 2011, he asked the late Steve Jobs what it would take to bring iPhone manufacturing jobs back the U.S. Jobs simply replied, "Those jobs aren't coming back.". So, while U.S. presidents love to pitch the idea of Apple bringing most of its manufacturing back to the states, it's not likely to happen. A New York Times article written four years ago describes a possible reason why:  It isn't just that workers are cheaper abroad. Rather, Apple's executives believe the vast scale of overseas factories as well as the flexibility, diligence and industrial skills of foreign workers have so outpaced their American counterparts that "Made in the U.S.A." is no longer a viable option for most Apple products. Don't expect President-elect Trump to be able change Apple's mind on this one. Encouraging Apple to repatriate billions in cash Trump proposed on the campaign trail a plan to offer American companies a tax repatriation fee of just 10%. Right now, many American companies leave their foreign profits in other countries instead of bringing the cash back here because the tax rate for doing so is 35%. President-elect Trump has said about overseas profits, "We'll bring it back, and it'll be taxed only at the rate of 10% instead of 35%. And who would bring it back at 35%? Obviously nobody, because nobody's doing it..." Apple, unsurprisingly, wants this as well. The company has lobbied for tax reforms in the past, namely because it has about $200 billion in cash overseas. Apple CEO Tim Cook said that the company hasn't brought foreign profits back into the U.S. because the tax rate is simply too high. Earlier this year, Cook said: When we bring it back, we will pay 35 percent federal tax and then a weighted average across the states that we're in, which is about 5 percent, so think of it as 40 percent. We've said at 40 percent, we're not going to bring it back until there's a fair rate. There's no debate about it. Considering that Trump is proposing a 10% rate, it seem that this would match up with Cook's "fair rate."  It's still unclear whether or not Trump would be able to do this. But with Republicans gaining control of the House, Senate, and the White House this time around, it seems very possible for them to implement it if they really want to.  That would clearly be a good thing for Apple and its investors. An HSBC economist, Kevin Logan, recently said that a low repatriation rate "could bring a flood of money back into the U.S. that would be available for dividends, share buybacks and possibly for capital investments." Apple stands on its own While a Trump presidency could certainly have some affect on Apple, investors should remember that the future of the company is ultimately determined by how well Apple itself performs. Apple's iPhone revenue fell 13% year over year in the company's fiscal 2016 fourth quarter. iPhones accounted for 60% of Apple's total revenue for the quarter, and its results mark three consecutive quarters of falling profit and revenue for the company. Clearly, Apple has more important things to focus on than what Trump has said. In an internal memo (obtained by BuzzFeed), Cook wrote to his employees following the election, saying, While there is discussion today about uncertainties ahead, you can be confident that Apple's North Star hasn't changed. Our products connect people everywhere, and they provide the tools for our customers to do great things to improve their lives and the world at large. In the wake of Trump's election, Apple's direction remains the same. The company lives and dies based on how well it makes and sells its products and services.

Could Look Like Under President Trump The president-elect already has a tumultuous relationship with Apple -- but that might not mean much in the end. Chris Neiger (TMFNewsie) Nov 11, 2016 at 5:24PM Image source: Getty Images. The dust is still settling from the surprising election of Donald Trump to the U.S. presidency. Markets tanked on the uncertainty of having Trump in the Oval Office, though they have since begun to bounce back. However, investors are still wondering what Trump's policies could mean for their investments, and that's particularly true for companies Trump singled out specifically during his campaign.  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) took several jabs from Trump over the past year, and there are a few policies that could directly affect the company. It's worth noting that Trump reportedly holds millions of Apple shares, so any of the following proposals would directly impact his portfolio as well. Let's take a look at two key proposals and why Apple is likely to remain steady under President-elect Trump. Persuading Apple to make more products in the U.S. Trump said at the same campaign rally where he called for an Apple boycott (over Apple's refusal to unlock an iPhone for the FBI) that he wants the company to bring its manufacturing out of China and into the U.S. Trump said, "I want to see the day when Apple makes its products on our land. We're going to bring our jobs back to this country." That's not all that unique of a proposal, though Trump has taken it a bit further by saying he would force jobs to come back to the U.S. by proposing high tariffs on imported consumer goods (which Wired points out would be virtually impossible to pull off). Apple jobs were actually brought up in the 2012 campaign election as well. And when President Obama met with Silicon Valley leaders in 2011, he asked the late Steve Jobs what it would take to bring iPhone manufacturing jobs back the U.S. Jobs simply replied, "Those jobs aren't coming back.". So, while U.S. presidents love to pitch the idea of Apple bringing most of its manufacturing back to the states, it's not likely to happen. A New York Times article written four years ago describes a possible reason why:  It isn't just that workers are cheaper abroad. Rather, Apple's executives believe the vast scale of overseas factories as well as the flexibility, diligence and industrial skills of foreign workers have so outpaced their American counterparts that "Made in the U.S.A." is no longer a viable option for most Apple products. Don't expect President-elect Trump to be able change Apple's mind on this one. Encouraging Apple to repatriate billions in cash Trump proposed on the campaign trail a plan to offer American companies a tax repatriation fee of just 10%. Right now, many American companies leave their foreign profits in other countries instead of bringing the cash back here because the tax rate for doing so is 35%. President-elect Trump has said about overseas profits, "We'll bring it back, and it'll be taxed only at the rate of 10% instead of 35%. And who would bring it back at 35%? Obviously nobody, because nobody's doing it..." Apple, unsurprisingly, wants this as well. The company has lobbied for tax reforms in the past, namely because it has about $200 billion in cash overseas. Apple CEO Tim Cook said that the company hasn't brought foreign profits back into the U.S. because the tax rate is simply too high. Earlier this year, Cook said: When we bring it back, we will pay 35 percent federal tax and then a weighted average across the states that we're in, which is about 5 percent, so think of it as 40 percent. We've said at 40 percent, we're not going to bring it back until there's a fair rate. There's no debate about it. Considering that Trump is proposing a 10% rate, it seem that this would match up with Cook's "fair rate."  It's still unclear whether or not Trump would be able to do this.

City officials have sought since July to condemn and demolish it as a public nuisance. Attorneys file response to city suit over rotting Cider Ridge house By Zach Tyler, Star Staff Writer, ztyler@annistonstar.com Zach Tyler Nov 11, 2016 (…) Bill Wilson/The Anniston Star A house along Apple Blossom Way is in disrepair. City officials have sought since July to condemn and demolish it as a public nuisance. Attorneys for a Jacksonville man and a homebuilding company at the center of a dispute over a half-finished house in one of Oxford’s priciest subdivisions this week filed responses to a city lawsuit against them both. Cedrick Baker’s attorney argues against demolishing the house, the city’s preferred solution, while homebuilder Chris Birchfield’s attorney says his client is guilty of no wrongdoing. The legal entanglement hinges on the house on Apple Blossom Way, in Oxford’s Cider Ridge neighborhood. Jacksonville resident Cedrick Baker more than two years ago hired Chris Birchfield’s building company, Birch LLC, to build the house according to plans Baker drew. Court documents say Baker halted construction on the $430,000 house when he found that Birchfield’s company wasn’t building it according to his plans. Baker later filed suit against the company, leaving the unfinished house in limbo. A subsequent lawsuit brought by the city of Oxford’s attorney last month, meanwhile, seeks a judge’s permission to condemn and demolish the structure as a public nuisance. Baker’s attorney in her filing this week argues against that. “We believe that the house should be left as-is until a resolution to the dispute is made,” Union Springs attorney Christina Crow said by phone Friday. Crow believes the “best evidence of whether Mr. Birchfield breached the contract and failed to follow specifications would be the house,” she said. Efforts to reach Harry Long, the Anniston attorney representing both Birchfield and his company, were unsuccessful Friday, but Long also filed a response this week to the city’s suit. Long’s answer claims a number of legal defenses while neither admitting nor denying the city’s allegations that the dispute between the company and Baker led to the unfinished, rotting house. The court filing argues that while the company, Birch, and Baker had an agreement, the company’s owner, Birchfield, was never involved in that agreement. Baker in his lawsuit seeks to recoup the $103,573 he’d paid to the company, and punitive damages for what he alleges was negligence and a breach of contract. Long has taken the position that Baker breached the contract, and is entitled to no damages. He has said the city’s suit may speed a resolution to Baker’s dispute with Birchfield and his company. Crow on Friday shared that hope. “Mr. Baker wants a house,” she said. “He doesn’t want a lawsuit.” Staff writer Zach Tyler: 256-235-3564. On Twitter @ZTyler_Star.

Follow TechnoBuffalo The iPad was mysteriously left out in the cold when Apple held its October event. A few models are in need of an upgrade and it was odd Apple didn’t announce anything new. But now we may know the reason why. According to Barclays Research analysts, Apple is prepping refreshed models for the 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch Pro models along with adding a new 10.9-inch bezel-free model in March. The new 10.9-inch iPad will apparently retain the same physical size as the 9.7-inch model, but the elimination of the bezels will allow for the bigger display. This may also hint at the end of the home button. The 12.9-inch iPad Pro refresh will get the True Tone display and 12-megapixel camera present in the smaller Pro model, Barclays Research said. Each new model will also reportedly sport four microphones and will retain the 3.5mm headphone jack—continuing to make the elimination of the port in the iPhone that much more head scratching. Apple won’t refresh the iPad Mini 4, which last received a minor redesign and spec upgrade in 2015. No word on whether the iPad Air 2 will be refreshed or not. What new iPads means for Apple These are just rumors at this point, but it does give us an understanding as to what direction the iPad line is heading. In the past year, with the introduction of the iPad Pro, Apple began making the shift to sell the iPad as more of a computer replacement than a computer companion. But with a new bezel-free iPad model, Apple may surprise us and reinvigorate its tablet lineup.

The latest batch of predictions from Barclays Research analysts fuel the rumor that the next iPhone will break the bezel barrier and go with a curved screen, according to MacRumors. Sources within Apple's supply chain told the analysts that while the design isn't 100% locked-down, it appears Apple is cutting out all the space on the sides of the screen and also dabbling with a wraparound display, Samsung Galaxy S7-style. The report adds that this means the future iPhone could move up to a 5-inch and 5.8-inch display from the 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch screens of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus without actually changing the size of the handset. Rumors of a curved display go back as far as this spring, alongside reports claiming Apple is looking to Samsung to produce said screens with a sharper, more energy-efficient OLED display. Add other rumored features such as wireless charging, a glass-backed finish, and even an iris scanner, and you've got yourself an Apple device that could be radically different than its predecessors - even if such speculation should always be taken with a grain of salt.

Having issues getting your Macbook Air to boot? Forgot how to reset your iPad Air 2's password? Accessing Apple's customer support is now as quick as ever, as the company launches a dedicated Apple Support app for iPhone, iPad, and iPod. The app - which requires iOS 9.0 or later - lets users look up troubleshooting articles on the fly, chat with a technician for more pressing issues, and even schedule an appointment with a nearby Apple Store or Apple-sanctioned service provider if things go beyond a DIY repair. The app also keeps information for multiple devices, making it easier for you (or a customer representative) to diagnose your device without having to guess which generation of MacBook or iPod Touch you're trying to fix.  At the time of writing, the app appears to be available only through the Netherlands region of the App Store. Given the English description on the page and the fact that the Apple Support app comes in a dozen different languages, it's very likely that it is in the process of rolling out, and could open up to different regions in good time. Until then, we contacted an Apple representative to learn more about the Apple Support's app plans to go global, and will update this story as more details emerge.  Get over $100 off a refurbished iPhone 6S or 6S Plus Via TechCrunch Tags MacBook Air ABOUT THE AUTHOR Parker Wilhelm Parker Wilhelm is a freelance writer for TechRadar.

In honor of 2016 Veterans Day, Tim Cook tweeted out a photo of some of the veterans who work at Apple. The App Store’s “For Those Who Serve” section provided resources on “military news, essential health and wellness info and valuable tools for everyday life” and Apple Music promoted playlists curated by former service members.  The App Store’s special 2016 Veterans Day section provides nearly four dozen cherry-picked apps divided into three distinct categories: News, Resources and Welness.

While Apple has always offered support for devices in its many retail locations, it seems to be looking for ways to create a slightly more hands-off approach. The app includes help articles and tips for your device, possibly with the hope that consumers won't come into the Apple store every time a problem comes up.

Rory and Lorelai have small-town charm (and caffeine) running through their veins. They rarely leave Connecticut, making them pretty much strangers to the city. Need proof? Just take a look back at this exchange between Rory and Jess when she went to visit him in Manhattan in the second season. “I’m no stranger to the Big Apple.” — Rory “You are if you’re calling it the Big Apple.” — Jess If they ever decided to leave Stars Hollow for a weekend trip -- never a permanent move -- here’s where they’d probably hang out in the city. The Strand Rory would be in heaven. The only thing that would be able to lure the literary maven from the racks would probably be the site of Jess, Dean or Logan walking by. Other than that, Strand Bookstore, 828 Broadway, Manhattan, would be a total time-suck for the Gilmore, especially once she discovered the lower-level record collection.

(Credit: Strand Bookstore) Tom’s We can picture it now: Lorelai singing "Tom's Diner" by Suzanne Vega every time she drops in for a burger or a cup of coffee. Similar to Luke's, it has been family-owned for decades, which would probably be that ounce of small-town charm Lorelai and Rory would cling to. They may even end up liking Tom's, 782 Washington Ave., Brooklyn, better once they experience the freedom of being allowed to use their cellphones in the diner.

If Lorelai and Rory weren't feeling Tom's -- say Lorelai caused a neighborhood uproar of some sort -- they'd grab their fourth cup of the morning at the original Café Grumpy, 193 Meserole Ave. in Brooklyn. The name would remind them of Luke himself, if the coffee alone didn't. (Credit: Café Grumpy) A Gilmore is never far away from a good coffee backup.

But Lane's mom probably had nearly same amount of antiques, just crammed into a much smaller space. The flea market sure would have come in handy when the Independence Inn caught fire. Lorelai may not have had to hire a decorator (and end up fighting with Emily about it) for the Dragonfly with the Fort Greene market's vast vintage selection.

Evan Niu (TMFNewCow) Nov 11, 2016 at 2:37PM iPhone 7 display. Image source: Apple. Universal Display (NASDAQ:OLED) shareholders, myself included, are no strangers to volatility. OLED display technology has been heralded as the next big thing for easily a decade, thanks to some inherent benefits such as energy efficiency and the possibility for innovative flexible form factors, among others. But the transition has taken quite a while, as weaknesses have had to be addressed over the years. Uncertain adoption has led to heightened volatility for years, but the transition away from traditional backlit LCDs still seems inevitable, even if it's taking longer than expected. Today, shares have surged 8% on no news specific to Universal Display; third-quarter earnings were already reported earlier this month. Well, you've probably already guessed the culprit by now: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Here comes the OLED iPhone 8 Plus The iPhone 8 in 2017 has long been expected to finally be when Apple makes the switch to OLED displays in its most important flagship product. A Sharp executive effectively confirmed Apple's intentions earlier this month, albeit without specifying a time frame. This time around, Barclays analysts have put out a research note on what they expect from the iPhone 8 (via MacRumors). Their supply chain research suggests that Apple is looking to remove the display bezel, which will facilitate larger displays in roughly comparable form factors that aren't much larger than the existing models. This bezel-less design could help the company increase display sizes from 4.7-inch to 5-inch on standard models, and 5.5-inch to 5.8-inch on the Plus models. The pertinent part for Universal Display is that only the larger 5.8-inch models are expected to include OLED displays. Apple is expected to tap Samsung and LG Display, which is unsurprising as those two companies are currently the largest OLED display manufacturers (and also Universal Display's largest customers). Sharp should join the mix within the next two years, and as such will likely announce a long-term commercial agreement with Universal Display to secure pricing on OLED materials, which in itself would be a huge win for Universal Display. Never underestimate Apple's marketing department If Apple chooses to make OLEDs an exclusive feature of the Plus models, you can expect the iPhone maker's marketing department to tout all of OLED's benefits. Apple always picks a feature that it reserves for the Plus models in an effort to upsell the Plus. For instance, last year the iPhone 6s Plus got optical image stabilization (OIS), while the 6s did not. This year, the iPhone 7 Plus has a fancy new dual-camera system, which the 7 didn't get (although the regular 7 now gets OIS). We know that iPhone demand is currently heavily concentrated on the 7 Plus, thanks largely to aforementioned dual-camera system, which should push up average selling prices and margins for Apple by shifting the mix toward larger models. If all of this plays out similarly next year with an OLED iPhone 8 Plus, not only will Universal Display enjoy a ton of revenue upside directly, but Apple would likely bring more attention to OLED displays categorically by focusing its marketing efforts on the inherent benefits. While it's true that most of the major Android OEMs have already adopted OLED to some extent, in which case the benefits of incrementally more awareness could be limited, it never hurts to have Apple market your technology. Apple would be the last big player to jump in. It seems increasingly likely that this years-long rumor may finally materialize in the near future.

Without getting into too much detail, Apple issued a prepared statement indicating that the company needed a "a little more time before AirPods are ready for our customers.” Recently, an optimistic, albeit sketchy, rumor hinted that Apple might begin shipping AirPods to retail outlets as early as late next week. Unfortunately, the rumor now appears to be off-the-mark in light of a new research report which claims that AirPods production might not even begin until December. And as if that weren't frustrating enough, the initial production run is said to be for just limited quantities. DON'T MISS: Leak suggests the iPhone 8 will finally get the redesign it deserves Citing sources close to Apple's supply chain, analysts from Barclays Research write that AirPods won't even hit the production line for at least another three to four weeks at best. What remains unclear, though, is when in December Apple is hoping to begin production. Apple would ideally like to have AirPods packaged and ready for purchase in time for the holiday shopping season, but that's starting to look less and less likely with each passing week. In fact, we wouldn't be surprised in the slightest if AirPods don't start shipping until early January of 2017. MacRumors reports: Barclays said the initial production run will be "fairly small," totaling between 10 million and 15 million AirPods to start. Depending on demand, the limited supply could result in a scenario where AirPods stock is quickly depleted upon launch, resulting in extended shipping estimates akin to a new iPhone launch. All in all, this isn't a good look for Apple. While it's one thing to give users a sneak peek at an upcoming product, promising a launch in October only to delay said launch for as much as two to three months is something that Apple observers used to mock other tech companies for.

Author: Wired Staff. Wired Staff Gear Date of Publication: 11.11.16. 11.11.16 Time of Publication: 2:21 pm. 2:21 pm The Wrist Is Interesting The market for wrist-worn fitness trackers is cooling. With recent reports of Fitbit’s profits dipping and the Apple Watch sales numbers not being super-great, a narrative has emerged over the last few weeks that wearables will soon be dead. There’s some truth to that, though in reality, it just means that the industry is changing to meet new consumer demands. David and Michael discuss what needs to happen for the market to get more interesting. Podcast RSS iTunes Download Some notes: IDC numbers are bad. Canalys numbers are way better. David’s feature story about Fitbit’s quest to get more people wearing Fitbits. David again on smartwatches and fitness trackers. Recommendations this week: Authy and the Garmin Forerunner 735XT.

Wired Staff Gear Date of Publication: 11.04.16. 11.04.16 Time of Publication: 3:40 pm. 3:40 pm Human Enough On this week’s Gadget Lab Podcast, we discuss voice assistants. We’re spending a lot of time talking to our devices. They’re talking back, too—products like Google Home and Amazon Echo can answer questions, give us helpful information, and tell stupid jokes. But what’s the end result of all this gabbing? Smarter AI assistants, sure. But the way we bark commands at our voice-controlled tech and treat the devices like lowly machines … is that making us ruder? Should we design the computers to talk to us more like humans in order to encourage empathy, or should we keep them cold and machine-like so we don’t get unhealthily attached? Is this even a problem? Podcast RSS iTunes Download Some notes: The Google Home is now available, and David talks to it. Also, Tim Moynihan puts Google’s Assistant and Amazon’s Alexa head-to-head to see which one keeps him company better. A year ago, David wrote about the coming wave of “crazy-powerful” AI assistants. David’s recommendation this week is Poisonfeather by Matthew Fitzsimmons. Michael recommends Amanda yerba mate.

For now, some of us still need powerful PCs. This week, we got to see that Microsoft and Apple are still intent on wowing our socks off when it comes to hardware for developers and creative professionals. With the new Surface Studio from Microsoft and the redesigned MacBook Pro from Apple, we’ve got some great options. Podcast RSS iTunes Download Some notes: The Surface Studio looks hot. So does the new MacBook Pro with the Touch Bar. Also see David’s hands-on report. Margaret Rhodes has some additional thoughts on the Touch Bar as well. There’s also a new Surface Book from Microsoft. David’s recommendation this week is Lessons From the Screenplay. Michael’s is the Jaybird X3 sweat-proof wireless earphones.

The Pixel maybe just tipped the scales, and it did so right at the moment we’re getting ready to move on to something else. With so many voice-controlled, non-smartphone devices in our homes, it sure feels like we’re at a flux point. Also, the Google Assistant, which lives in the Pixel, is so so powerful, and we’re headed for more of that. Michael and David (who is back from Bogota) discuss the changes in the personal tech landscape. Podcast RSS iTunes Download Some notes: David’s review of the Google Pixel. A gallery of the full-size images he shot with the phone in Colombia. Tim Moynihan’s story about the Pixel’s advanced camera technology.

We bring in an expert, WIRED’s own Peter Rubin, to chart all of it. Peter manages WIRED’s culture and entertainment coverage and co-hosts The Monitor, our culture podcast. Peter is also well-steeped in face computers: he’s written stellar stories about Oculus and he’s been testing and ranking each new VR system as it’s released. With David out this week, Michael and Peter talk about PSVR, Google Daydream View, and the future of “untethered” real-deal VR. Podcast RSS iTunes Download Some notes: Read Peter’s review of the Sony PlayStation VR headset and his report from last week’s Oculus Connect. Also, Chris Kohler writes about rhythm games and short-play games in VR. David Pierce has the details on Google’s phone-based Daydream View.

This week saw the debut of two new Pixel phones (the first ever phones from Google), plus the retail release of Google Home and the Daydream View phone-based VR headset. The Pixel phones are exciting—not only because of their premium design, but also because they include the new Google Assistant, a more advanced version of Google Now that helps you communicate, make plans, and run your life more efficiently. But, maybe it doesn’t work super-great just yet. Podcast RSS iTunes Download Some notes: Watch Google’s presentation from Tuesday, and read our roundup of everything that was announced. Read Brian Barrett’s story on Pixel’s place in the Android world. Margaret Rhodes on Google’s “Trojan Horse” plan for AI.

What we watch, what we watch it on, and what we do while we watch it. Not only is the technology of TV changing, but the content is morphing in a way that alters what we think of as “television.” Is a YouTube video TV? Sure, right. What about a Snapchat story, or a local city council meeting on Twitter? Yes—why not. The hosts discuss these changes in light of YouTube’s new app, Twitter’s new strategy, Snap’s new hardware, and Roku’s new future-proofed players.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Real Estate Classifieds Site Archive New Dickey's restaurant ready to smoke it up in Apple Valley Friday Nov 11, 2016 at 11:47 AM Nov 11, 2016 at 11:47 AM Rene Ray De La Cruz Staff Writer @DP_ReneDeLaCruz APPLE VALLEY — Hungry guests at the High Desert's newest Dickey's Barbecue Pit gazed up at a menu full of barbecue goodies such as beef brisket, pork ribs, pulled pork and other traditional classics. Located in the Jess Ranch Marketplace in Apple Valley, Dickey's opened its doors for a VIP "family and friends" event a day before the eatery opened to the public for the first time on Thursday. “It’s great to be in Apple Valley and we plan to serve our customers the best barbecue they’ve ever tasted,” General Manager Abel Flores told the Daily Press. “Tonight is a soft opening and we plan on having an official grand opening soon.” While Flores continued to share about the store, visitors of all ages feasted on free smoked meat, classic sandwiches, butcher tacos and side orders of cabbage slaw, potato salad, beans and other Southern classics. A large sign inside the store spotlighted the eatery's "hand rubbed" and "hand sliced" meat that is smoked slowly at 225 degrees on site daily. As employees filled customers orders, behind them was a large refrigerator that shows stacks of meat ready to be smoked and culinary experts assembling meals served on metal trays. “We did so well in Victorville that we felt it was time to move into Apple Valley where we could showcase Dickey’s barbecue menu,” Flores said. “Being close to Victor Valley College and Lucerne gives more people the opportunity to try our barbecue.” Assistant Manager Trenell Sandres, who was busy welcoming guests, said the eatery, just north of the Target entrance and near Apple Valley Road, employs nearly 20 people. “We have an awesome crew working here and it’s been great working with Abel,” Sandres said. “I hope that we can put a lot of smiles on a lot of faces.” Flores said a barbershop quartet will perform at Dickey’s from 4 to 8 p.m. every Saturday in November. On Sunday, Dickey’s will offer a free kid’s meal with a $10 adult purchase. Three lucky guests will win free barbecue for an entire year. Guests can enter to win by using #1FreeYearOfBBQ on social media, by placing an order for the new location online or by signing up for the Big Yellow Cup Club. Considered the nation's largest barbecue chain, Dickey’s Barbecue Restaurants was founded in 1941 by Travis Dickey with the goal of preparing authentic slow-smoked barbecue. With the tag line, "We Speak Barbecue," the Dallas-based, family-run company has expanded to more than 560 locations in 43 states. Dickey’s recently won first place on Fast Casual’s “Top 100 Movers and Shakers” and ranked in the top 10 of Franchise Times’ “Fast and Serious.” Dickey’s Barbecue Pit was recognized for the third year by Nation’s Restaurant News as a “Top 10 Growth Chain” and by Technomic as the “Fastest-growing restaurant chain in the country.” For more information, visit www.dickeys.com. The new Dickey’s is located at 19201 Bear Valley Road in Apple Valley. For more information, call 760-240-5556 or search Dickey's Apple Valley on Facebook.  Rene Ray De La Cruz may be reached at 760-951-6227, RDeLa Cruz@VVDailyPress.com or on Twitter @DP_ReneDeLaCruz.

November 11 AAPL: 108.43 0.64 Apple begins hiring staff for new Campus 2 ahead of move-in early next year Jordan Kahn - 4 days ago @JordanKahn iPhone 7 MacBook Pro Apple Campus 2 View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Apple has started hiring for positions needed at its new Campus 2 facility ahead of a move-in date expected for sometime early next year. Up until now hiring of employees necessary for construction of the new campus has been handled through a third-party. New job listings on Apple’s website appear to be offering permanent positions at the facility set to become the company’s headquarters, specifically for staff that will also be needed to facilitate moving in next year. Of note, one job listing is looking for a “Loading Dock Master” to be responsible for all loading dock operations and to manage and train new staff. The role is also responsible for ‘the delivery of materials from the loading dock to campus locations.” Late last month we noted that Apple was preparing for finishing touches at the new campus as it estimated building construction to be complete by the end of this year. Apple’s current general timeline for the project estimates landscaping work to continue into the first quarter of 2017. The company is currently thought to have plans to begin moving into the new location by the end of January 2017, that is at least according to Tim Cook’s latest to employees earlier this year.  On Apple’s website detailing job creation milestones, the company notes that the new campus in Cupertino will support 41,000 jobs in Santa Clara County with 12,600 full-time construction jobs over three-years it will take to complete. In its latest 2015 update, the company said it was “responsible for creating and supporting 1.9 million jobs” in total around the globe. The new 176-acre campus will include approximately 2.8 million sq ft of office space and house over 13,000 Apple employees when the company begins the move-in process. It will also be home to a new underground 1000-seat “Apple Theater” auditorium expected to play host to upcoming Apple events and product unveilings.  A report last month noted that Apple had recently rearranged office space in its plans for Campus 2, allowing it to accommodate potentially “thousands” of more employees above its original 13,000 estimate. As always, you can stay up to date with the latest updates for Campus 2 in our ongoing construction progress timeline.

Etsy previously accepted Apple Pay within the Etsy app for iOS devices, but with support for Apple Pay on the web, Apple users can pay with Apple Pay using Safari on any supported Mac or iOS device. Etsy is accepting Apple Pay payments in Australia, Canada, France, Hong Kong, Singapore, Switzerland, the United States, and the United Kingdom. Just as it does in Etsy's iOS app, Apple Pay enables buyers to complete their purchases quickly without needing to add their billing or shipping information at checkout. And as with all other Apple Pay transactions, Apple Pay transactions on the web are encrypted using the mobile wallet on the buyer's device. To use Apple Pay on the web while shopping on Etsy, buyers simply select Apple Pay at checkout and then authorize the payment using Touch ID following a prompt on their iOS device.Apple Pay on the web was introduced with iOS 10 and macOS Sierra, giving Apple Pay users an alternative to payment services like PayPal. Since Apple Pay on the web went live, many websites and payment providers have implemented support for the feature, and it is on its way to being widely accepted. With Apple Pay on the web, purchases made on a Mac are confirmed through a connection to an Apple Watch or an iPhone, with the purchase authorized via Touch ID. On iOS devices, making a purchase using Apple Pay on the web is similar to making a purchase within an app. Apple Pay on the web requires iOS 10 or macOS Sierra, along with an Apple Pay-compatible device. On Mac, a purchase needs to be confirmed with an iPhone 6, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone SE, or Apple Watch, while mobile web payments are available on the above listed iPhones and the following iPads: iPad Air 2, iPad mini 3, iPad mini 4, and all iPad Pro models.

By Brooke Crothers Published November 11, 2016 FoxNews.com Facebook0 Twitter0 livefyre Email Print iPhone 7 Plus (Apple) Is the larger iPhone 7 really a meaningful upgrade from the iPhone 6s Plus? Read on. The most striking thing about the iPhone 7s Plus— the 5.5-inch Plus is the larger of the two new phones— is just how similar it is physically to the iPhone 6 Plus introduced in 2014. Ditto on the iPhone 6s Plus, introduced last year. In fact, I’m guessing the non-geek, average consumer couldn’t tell the difference between all three— even after using them. I’ve owned all three and recently switched to the 7 Plus. Here are my impressions. Camera: It’s Apple’s best yet. I’ve compared photos from my iPhone 6s Plus and iPhone 7 Plus and the latter produces better photos in low-light. I take most of my photos in low-light or ambient room light and the iPhone 7 Plus camera renders more accurate colors and detail. But I have to look hard. The difference isn’t going to jump out at you. And, again, the average consumer (non-photography buff) probably wouldn’t notice.   APPLE UNVEILS NEW IPHONES: THE IPHONE 7 AND 7 PLUS I’m trying not to carp. Enthusiasts who obsess about image quality will definitely notice. And it's important to note that camera quality doesn’t improve in big leaps. It’s incremental. So, hats off to Apple for continuing to make its iPhone cameras good enough that most consumers can ditch their stand-alone DSLRs. (I ditched my pricey DSLR when I got the iPhone 5s.) There is one thing that everyone will notice, however, novices and experts alike: the “telephoto” capability that is only available on the iPhone 7 Plus. The telephoto technology uses two lenses (versus one on the smaller iPhone 7).  In short, up to 2X, you get higher-quality zoom. I definitely noticed this right away. The novice will too. No headphone jack: The sole Lightning connector on the iPhone 7 is a game changer. This didn’t hit me until, out of habit, I sat down and unthinkingly tried to plug my old headphones into the iPhone 7 Plus. At that moment, I also realized that I had probably a half a dozen headphones with old-style 3.5mm jacks that I couldn’t use with iPhone 7 Plus without an adapter. And, tangentially, I noticed that using the Lighting headphones with the Lightning port on my iPad Pro doesn’t work for me because it blocks easy access to the home button. That doesn’t bode well for future iPads unless Apple changes the position of the Lightning connector. IS APPLE WORKING ON THE BIGGEST IPHONE GAME-CHANGER EVER? That said, it’s progress. Everyone hates it when technology changes. But after the initial temper tantrum, most people soon forget what all the fuss was about. That will apply to the headphone jack-less iPhone 7 too. Solid-state home button: I welcome the switch to a solid-state home button from the mechanical one on all previous iPhones. And I expect all Apple iOS devices to adopt solid-state buttons. It provides better feedback, is more responsive, and just plain easier to use. Battery life: While I haven’t done exact down-to-the-minute comparisons, generally, after weeks of use, I haven’t noticed a difference – good or bad – between the iPhone 7 Plus and my previous iPhone 6s Plus. And I don’t think the average buyer will be either disappointed by or ecstatic over the iPhone 7 Plus’ battery life. It generally lasts all day unless I’m traveling and using it constantly all day. In the latter case, it needs recharging before the day is out. APPLE OFFERS DEALS ON IPHONES, MACBOOKS, AND MORE Performance: I do notice subtle speed improvements. Though the iPhone 7 packs a new Apple A10 processor, I believe a good chunk of the speed boost comes from the 3GB of RAM in the 7 Plus – that’s 1GB more than the 2GB of the smaller iPhone 7. As anyone who has done a DIY upgrade of a PC knows, if you add RAM, everything gets snappier. That applies to mobile devices too. Water resistance: I have not tested the improved water resistance and will only do so if I’m forced to. Apple doesn't cover water damage under the standard warranty. So, I’m not going to push my luck. But tech sites have done lots of testing so I’ll refer you to in-depth testing. And some tests, by the way, showed that damage did occur. To wrap up, is the iPhone 7 a major improvement over the iPhone 6s? No. And it's not light years ahead of the iPhone 6 either. That said, if you obsess about photo quality, need better water resistance, and insist on having the fastest iPhone, it's worth the upgrade.

News Dow Soars To High On Trump; Big Techs, Gold Lag: Week In Review Donald Trump's presidential victory triggered big stock, gold and commodity shifts, with the Dow hitting a record high. (AP) IBD STAFF 11/11/2016 Reprints Donald Trump's unexpected presidential win shook up global markets, triggering a major sector rotation. Alibaba (BABA) reported solid sales for Singles Day. Walt Disney sees better growth, but not until 2018, while most department stores generally see a positive holiday season while Nvidia (NVDA) led strong chip results. Stocks Rally, Diverge On Trump Win Stock futures crashed Tuesday night as Donald Trump won the presidential election, but rallied Wednesday as investors saw upside to his tax and infrastructure plans. Investors rushed into banks, drugs, materials-related stocks and out of big-name techs such as Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Facebook (FB), as well as defensive consumer staples and gunmakers. The Dow soared 5.4% for the week, its best since December 2011, hitting a record high Thursday. The S&P 500 jumped 3.8%, its best week in two years, rebounding above its 50-day line. The Nasdaq also rose 3.8% but ended the week below its 50-day. Gold prices initially jumped on Trump's win but crashed  as stocks rallied, Treasury yields skyrocketed and Fed rate-hike expectations firmed. Copper prices boomed. Nvidia and Priceline (PCLN) were among leading stocks reporting strong results. Nvidia, Microchip, MaxLinear Beat Q3 Goals Top chip companies Nvidia, Microchip Technology (MCHP), MaxLinear (MXL) and Microsemi (MSCC) saw their stocks rise after posting better-than-expected quarterly results. Graphics chipmaker Nvidia earned 84 cents a share, up 91% year over year, on sales of $2 billion, up 54%. Wall Street expected 57 cents and $1.69 billion. Nvidia also raised its Q4 sales target above views. Microchip EPS rose 42% and sales 56%. MaxLinear also topped views, though guidance was weak due to legacy-product declines. Nvidia shares skyrocketed 30% on Friday to a new high. For the week so far, Microchip rose 4.8%, MaxLinear 12% and Microsemi 9.7%. 'The Force' May Be With Disney's 2018 Walt Disney (DIS) missed fiscal Q4 estimates and warned that 2017 would be "an anomaly" in its growth arc, with the box-office-melting success of "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" making for a tough year-over-year comparison. But investors may already be looking to fiscal 2018, when Disney will release four Marvel movies and two more "Star Wars" films. Disney also said that the factors that have caused ESPN to lose subscribers "have abated," and that the sports network would likely continue to grow as ESPN adapts to more digital platforms. Disney shares rose nearly 6% for the week so far. Department Stores Mixed On Holidays Macy's (M) missed Q3 estimates but cited strong results from Apple and Michael Kors (KORS) products that should continue in the current holiday quarter. (But luxury apparel maker Kors itself warned on its holiday sales). Macy's raised its full-year same-store sales forecast. Kohl's (KSS) reported Q3 EPS and revenue above expectations, with strong back-to-school and October sales that should continue into the holiday season. Nordstrom (JWN) crushed EPS growth estimates. The upscale department store operator raised its full year EPS guidance to $2.85-$2.95, well above Wall Street estimates. However, J.C. Penney (JCP) sales missed expectations and cut its sales forecast. But shares of all four retailers enjoyed double-digit percentage gains for the week. Priceline Travels To New Heights Priceline reported Q3 earnings and revenue that topped estimates, sending its shares to an all-time high. Priceline also said interim CEO Brett Keller is taking over as permanent chief executive, effective immediately. TripAdvisor (TRIP), a Priceline rival, reported weaker-than-expected Q3 revenue, sending shares falling. Alibaba Gets Dumped On Singles Day E-commerce giant Alibaba Group processed $17.8 billion worth of sales on China's biggest online shopping day of the year, known as Singles Day. That busted last year's record of $14.3 billion. But growth slowed to 24% from 60% last year. Alibaba takes a small percentage of sales for managing the transaction for vendors. Alibaba shares fell 1.4% Friday, extending a slide since late September. The Singles Day event towers over the U.S. shopping events known as Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Black Friday last year had total sales of $4.5 billion, and Cyber Monday had $3 billion. NetEase Revenue Falls Short Chinese online game maker and portal NetEase (NTES) earned $3.42 per U.S. share excluding items in the third quarter, up 47%. Sales rose 38% to $1.38 billion in Q3. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected NetEase to earn $2.89 per share excluding items on sales of $1.43 billion. Online games accounted for 71% of revenue. NetEase tumbled 3.6% for the week afternoon, falling significantly below its 50-day line for the first time since April. Gold Prices, Stocks Rally Like A Lead Balloon Gold prices skyrocketed Tuesday night as stock futures and the dollar initially tumbled on fears that a Trump win would spur massive selling and put the Fed on ice. But with stocks actually faring well and bond yields spiking, gold prices quickly reversed for a weekly loss of more than 6%, the worst since 2013. Gold mining stocks that retook some key technical levels went back down. Newmont Mining (NEM) fell 16%, Barrick Gold (ABX) 19%. Meanwhile, industrial miners rallied as Trump infrastructure plans lifted copper, other industrial metals and materials. Momo Beats, But Stock Dives China-based Momo (MOMO) reported Q3 earnings that beat estimates, which the company credited to its success with live video. The provider of a video streaming website and mobile social platform said revenue surged 319% to $157 million, soaring past estimates of $130.5 million. Momo sees Q4 revenue of $185 million-$190 million, above forecasts for $140.2 million. But Momo's stock, which initially rose to a new high, reversed sharply lower to trade down more than 8%. Fiber Optics Earnings Acacia Communications (ACIA) late Thursday reported Q3 earnings minus items that rose 240% to $1.01, as revenue jumped 107% to $135.3 million. Analysts had modeled non-GAAP EPS of 81 cents and revenue of $130.8 million after Acacia revised guidance twice during the quarter. The maker of high-speed optical devices for communications networks sees adjusted EPS of 85-92 cents vs. views of 78 cents. But revenue of $138.5 million at the midpoint of its guidance is just above the consensus for $137.2 million. Acacia fell 1% Friday but rose 12.8% for the week. Fabrinet (FN) late Monday said fiscal Q1 EPS leapt 78% to 80 cents while revenue was up 53% to $332 million, its fourth straight quarter of accelerating growth. Both easily beat analyst estimates. Fabrinet also gave upbeat EPS and sales guidance for the current Q2. Fabrinet shares rose 8.9% for the week. Oil Prices Fall Again Oil prices initially rose but closed down 1.5% to $43.41 a barrel — the third straight weekly slide — amid concerns about rising supply and weak demand. Meanwhile, President-elect Donald Trump has called for less regulation and more drilling for the U.S. industry, which could ultimately boost supply further. Weekly U.S. crude stockpiles rose by 2.43 million barrels, the Energy Information Administration said, an increase that was above analyst expectations. OPEC said its October production hit a record high, adding doubts that it will finalize and implement a production-cut agreement. The International Energy Agency warned that sluggish economic growth will continue to weigh on oil demand, and ConocoPhillips (COP) cut its capital spending for next year.

Move over Apple and Samsung, China's mobile market is after world domination. By David Gilbert November 11, 2016 18:17 GMT The Chinese smartphone revolution is upon us, below are the biggest brands seeking to take down Apple and SamsungReuters The smartphone market is slowing down. Samsung and its exploding phones are struggling and even Apple is feeling the pinch. As the big names in the market begin to wane, others are threatening to supplant them — and they all come from China. The Chinese smartphone market is a bit of a basket case, with hundreds if not thousands of companies producing smartphones which range from premium flagship devices to budget white label products to be sold in developing countries. Most of these companies we will never hear about and will soon disappear as the market consolidates, but for a handful, they have the chance to become household names, looking to leverage their scale and ability to produce premium devices at a fraction of the price of those from Apple and Samsung. So who are these emerging companies? Huawei The best-known of the cohort is Huawei. Already the world's number three smartphone maker, the company has not been shy about stating its ambitions. "When we announced four years ago that we wanted to sell phones, people told us we were crazy. When we said we wanted to sell 100 million phones, they told us we were crazy," Richard Yu, chief executive of Huawei's consumer business group, told Reuters last month. He added that Huawei will overtake Apple as the world's second biggest smartphone maker by 2018, and then set it sights on Samsung. Huawei made its name as the producer of low-priced smartphones, but in recent years has made a significant push into the premium end of the market. While it is already selling its budget Honor brand in the US, last month it announced it would be bringing a flagship smartphone — the Mate 9 — to the American market for the first time. The Huawei Mate 9 sports a crisp 5.9in FHD displayIBTimes UK Huawei still has to overcome some issues related to its brand, but with sales continuing to climb dramatically, it has every chance of meeting its ambitious goals. Xiaomi Xiaomi is best known for being called the Apple of the East, even though the comparison isn't really accurate. The company has made its name selling smartphones in its home country and a handful of other Asian markets. While the company was at one point valued at $45 billion, that valuation has since dropped as the company has struggled to sustain it meteoric sales growth because it does not sell its phones in enough markets. Xiaomi, once hailed as the world's most valuable startup, has seen its fortunes changeReuters The reason? Xiaomi, like many Chinese companies, does not have a robust patent portfolio behind them and expect to be met by lawsuits when they launch in a developed market like the US and western Europe. But, thanks to deals with the likes of Qualcomm and Microsoft that allows access to their respective patents, Xiaomi finally looks set to make a play for the big leagues. Its head of international development, Hugo Barra, who previously ran Android at Google, confirmed last month that Xiaomi was testing its phone on US carrier networks, paving the way for a launch in 2017. Will it succeed? No one really knows. Vivo and Oppo According to IDC, Oppo and Vivo were the world's 4th and 5th biggest smartphone manufacturers in the third quarter of 2016. Both companies are relative unknowns in this part of the world, but we are bundling them together here as they share the same parent company BKK Electronics. OnePlus, another Chinese company which has attracted a lot of attention for its premium smartphones on a budget, is also part of the BKK stable. While these companies have made their name by selling in the sub-£200 market, they are also looking to make themselves stand out by offering unique features, including a unique rapid charging technology and claims to having the world's thinnest smartphone. The OnePlus 3 has been hailed as a budget smartphone beast OnePlus While again China is the main market for these brands (though not OnePlus which has from the start been a global brand), international expansion is now ramping up and we should expect both names to become much more recognisable in the coming 12 months. LeEco The outlier among these companies, LeEco is a company which has made a big splash in the last 12 months, with everything from its own version of Netflix to a self-driving car. Not just smartphones. LeEco is also developing a self-driving electric carLeEco It also sells smartphones and recently held a major launch event in the US to announce its presence, having made its name in China. Its $300 Le Pro 3 smartphone is positioned as competitor to Apple's iPhone and Samsung's Galaxy S7, with the extra appeal of having LeEco's streaming services pre-installed. However, the company's billionaire founder Yueting Jia has just announced that it is running out of cash, so may have to scale back its plans. LeEco clearly has ambitious plans but without the cash to make a major marketing assault on the US or elsewhere, it is hard to see the brand making a significant impact. ZTE One Chinese company which has already made an impact is ZTE. It has been operating in the US and European markets for a few years, having previously operated as a white label manufacturer for carriers. The ZTE Axon 7 is another cheap but powerful smartphone from ChinaZTE It has shrewdly signed marketing deals with sports franchises across the US and Europe while also launching a range of devices in almost all price brackets, including its premium Axon range which competes at the top of the market. ZTE, like Huawei, started life as a manufacturer of networking equipment. It has since built close relationships with carriers around the world, owns a patent portfolio to back up its products and uses a clever marketing strategy — all of which mean it has a much bigger chance of succeeding long term than many of the other Chinese companies which may briefly appear on the bestseller lists, before disappearing just as quickly.

By Guest 26 Comments   Print It’s Friday, everyone! And that means another Primal Blueprint Real Life Story from a Mark’s Daily Apple reader. If you have your own success story and would like to share it with me and the Mark’s Daily Apple community please contact me here. In fact, I have a contest going right now. So if you have a story to share, no matter how big or how small, you’ll be in the running to win a big prize. Read more here. Dear Mark, This letter has been a long time coming. Like many of your readers, I had followed the standard American diet rather thoughtlessly, though I did experiment some with vegetarianism. I loved baking my own bread and even bought and ground my own flour. But though I was rather a skinny teen, I gradually ballooned up. And I do mean balloon. I was so uncomfortable, nothing fit, and all my weight was around my stomach and my face. I knew I couldn’t go on like that. When I turned 40, we decided to get serious about our health and eating. My wife had also gained a lot of weight. We discovered Atkins, lost some and then fell off the wagon and added more back on. We tried again. This time my wife lost a ton, and so did I. I dropped back to about 155 or so. Again, like so many, the weight began to creep back, even when I got stricter with my carbs. It was so frustrating! I never went back to the SAD diet that had gotten me in such sorry shape, but we were eating a ton of substitutionary foods packed with things like Splenda. Well, you get the idea. Enough is enough, I thought. I can do this. I know I can. So I set my mind to be strict with my Atkins and up the exercise. My goal: to be fabulously fit by fifty. And I did a not bad job! I had the flexibility with my work to get in long gym hours and by dent of effort (in other words, chronic cardio), I gradually shaped up quite a bit. My cardio workouts were so insane on the step machine that I found out they called me the crazy man at the desk. One year in, I was very pleased with the efforts: But, of course, there was no way I could keep up that insane workout schedule, and I had grown to hate the stepper and even resented the gym visits all the time. I certainly achieved my personal goal of fabulously fit by fifty, but my knees were killing me. I had taken up running, but found that I couldn’t keep on doing it. I felt like I had a pebble in my knee. My wife and I were always learning, studying, trying to master this. We’d seen such progress, but… Then we read Wheatbelly and were blown away, and somehow that also led us to your website. It was November 2011. Before long things really did begin to change for us. I gave the Vibrams and toe-strike running a try. Knee pain? Gone! I even ran the length of half marathon one year on a cruise ship in the Pacific as Baja floated past. It was insanely fun. Just did it because I could. I tried different workouts, but had difficulty sticking to anything for long. I was glad, though, that I had everything we needed at home. No more gyms sucking up my cash! My wife and I began regular walks and have continued it to this day. We kept learning about eating. Tried some Whole 30’s and some other variations, but we’ve always returned to Primal. It’s just doable for us. We love it. I enjoy my square of chocolate and the occasional glass of red wine (Botabox cab is my favorite). Exercise has become steady: I’ve settled into a routine these days of walking outside at least 10k steps Monday through Saturday, and taking it a bit easier on Sunday, but trying to get 5k. As I walk, I do 200 push-ups on Monday through Saturday (eight sets of 25 each). Additionally, at least two days a week I sprint. I tried sprinting on the bike and just dreaded it. Lately I’ve been sprinting outside and it has been great. I found that the key for me taking off is lifting high those knees. It picks up a little bit of speed at first and then it just takes off. I love it! Thanks to Mr. Money Mustache, my wife and I now ride our bikes up to church and for errands around town. Lots of fun. Anywho, it’s been a trip and a half, and we are grateful to you and your generous spirit and the wonderful information you have provided us through all these years. When I noticed the Friday without a story, I thought: I need to write. I’ve scrounged info from your site for years and have not given back. So here’s my meagre attempt. Tomorrow I will turn 56. I am 5 foot, 10 inches tall, and I weigh about 146 at present. Body fat hangs at about 12% and I’ve never felt better in my life. For the last two days, in fact, my wife and I tackled a tree that needed to come down in our yard. Pay someone to cut it? No way. We cut the sucker down with a handsaw and a pruning hook. Talk about feeling great. Anyway, my last pic is basically where I am now. This was a couple months ago on Father’s Day. Thank you, Mark. My wife and I are among the many thousands who are so thankful for what you do. – William TAGS:  reader-created content   Print Post navigation twentysixteen < Previous post How to Harness the Self-Enhancement Bias (and Claim a Bigger Life) twentysixteen Next post > Shrimp with Kimchi Mayo Subscribe to the Newsletter Related Posts Five Years Paleo—and NEVER Looking Back!

I love the success stories in general, but I really enjoy the ones that are from those who are close to my age (56). It is inspiring to read about youngsters that turn their health around while they still have many years ahead, but it is even more motivating to see that this way of living is beneficial, and doable, for all of us, no matter our age. It’s unbelievable that you are 60 in that last picture! I’m going to have to try your trick for sprinting. I feel like a clod when I try to sprint… 5  |     Reply   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧ William 3 days 20 hours ago Thanks, my friend, but I’m not 60 yet!

I’m 56 and have a lot of digestive challenges, which makes staying on a Paleo diet difficult. Which online support groups do you or others recommend? It needs to be free. I’ve read Mark’s book.

Family, if you have some local, or neighbors. Friends doing this together makes it just great. Enjoy your feasts together; plan on fasting some together; take walks together. I think the internet support is great but only gets you so far. God gave us neighbors for a reason!

If your main PC is a laptop, chances are you appreciate having more than one power adapter available to charge it with. Typically you'll want a couple at home and one at work if it doubles as your work machine. Apple realizes this, and so with the 2016 version of the MacBook Pro it has decided to eke out a little more profit from sales of power adapters. Is anyone surprised? In order for a 2016 MacBook Pro power adapter to work it requires the power adapter itself, the main cable for insertion into a power outlet, and a USB-C cable to connect it to your laptop. Apple sells a 13-inch model power adapter for $69 or a 15-inch model power adapter for $79. But as 9to5Mac rightly points out, both don't work out of the box because neither includes a USB-C cable. You could argue that Apple already provided a USB-C cable with the MacBook Pro, but that's really not the point. When purchasing a new power adapter, especially one that costs upwards of $69, I expect it to include everything required to charge a laptop. Instead, Apple will happily sell you a USB-C to Lightning Cable (1 meter) for $19, or a 2-meter version for $29. //Related Articles MacBook Pro 2016: Should You Upgrade? So, if you only want to use official Apple accessories, and who wouldn't after having paid anywhere between $1,499 and $2,799 for a MBP? An extra power adapter with all the cables required to use it will actually cost from $88 up to $108. There are two reasons I can think of why Apple has decided not to ship a USB-C cable with its power adapters. The first is because customers don't want or need the cable. The second is profit. I highly doubt any customers would be upset by having an extra cable to use, so the second reason makes much more sense. If you have other possible reasons, I'd love to hear them. Apple recently (but only temporarily) dropped the prices of its accessories due to complaints. Hopefully similar levels of upset will push Apple to revisit power adapters and add another cable in the box.

In a research note obtained by MacRumors, the analysts said the 10.9-inch model's borderless design will allow for it to be the same physical size as the current-generation 9.7-inch iPad Pro. That means the display itself will need to have an edge-to-edge design, possibly signaling the removal of the Home button. Multiple rumors have claimed Apple is developing a new iPad in the 10-inch range, but the exact screen size has varied in each report. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said a new 10.5-inch iPad Pro will launch in 2017, while Japanese website Mac Otakara said a new 10.1-inch iPad Pro will launch in early 2017. Barclays, like Kuo, expects the new 9.7-inch iPad Pro to be a "low-cost" model alongside the 7.9-inch iPad mini, which the analysts do not believe will be refreshed alongside the larger tablets. Instead, the research note said Apple will continue to produce and sell the iPad mini 4, released in September 2015. Mac Otakara previously said the 12.9-inch iPad Pro will feature a True Tone display like its current 9.7-inch counterpart, using advanced four-channel ambient light sensors to automatically adapt the color and intensity of the display to match the light in the surrounding environment. That report said all three new iPad Pro models will gain quad microphones, compared to the current dual setup, and retain 3.5mm headphone jacks. The 12.9-inch iPad Pro is also said to gain the 9.7-inch model's same 12-megapixel rear-facing iSight camera and True Tone flash. More "revolutionary" changes to iPads, including a switch to OLED displays, are expected in 2018, according to Kuo's earlier report.

With no bezel, there’s not “safe” place to grip the device while holding it. The OS will have to determine what’s a deliberite touch vs indiscriminate touch.

Not to mention, we have 3 screen sizes now, but 5 iPad models to choose from, before considering 3/4 colors, 3 capacities, and 2 connectivity options. It's starting to seem a lot like Android devices, except with hardware, not software, fragmentation. Rating: 8 Votes BMcCoy 4 days ago at 09:05 am I always laugh at any story about Apple products that suggests a "low-cost" model..! Rating: 8 Votes BWhaler 4 days ago at 09:21 am I would buy the 10.9 in a heartbeat. I use the iPad at work intensely throughout the day. I've longed for a size between the two Pro models. The 12.9 is just too big and bulky, the 9.7 is perfect to carry and not be obtrusive or rude in meetings. But the 9.7 could use a bit more screen real estate. A 10.9 in the package size of a 9.7 would be heaven. Happy to pay a premium for it. Of course, it's a bummer there's no OLED, which in 2017 is shocking. But this is Tim Cooke's Apple now, and we're going to have to get used to MBAs and their spreadsheets trickling out technology over the years to keep us upgrading. The days of Steve getting on stage showing devices packed with the best Apple could make are over, alas. But my main hope for 2017 is Apple has a serious fork in iOS and Apps for the iPad and gets serious about making the iPad a productivity device. Apple doesn't seem to get that what's holding back the line, and the reason I see more and more Surfaces on planes and in meetings, is the software. It's not the lack of speakers or more microphones or the iPads needs more thinness. It's simply that it's harder to do a lot of productivity workflows with the limits of iOS and their first party apps. Moreover, a serious investment from Apple in iPad software would signal the app ecosystem their commitment.

And while some have rushed to call these accessories obsolete, … The smartwatch market is currently dominated by the Apple iWatch and the Samsung Gear smartwatches. And while some have rushed to call these accessories obsolete, other companies see a bright future in this market. One of them is Vector Watch, the maker of the world’s only smartwatch with a battery life of 30 days. The Bucharest-based watchmaker recently joined forces with BMW to deliver limited edition model inspired by the BMW i sub-brand. The Vector Luna BMW i Limited Edition watch was unveiled this week in a private event. Inspired by the design and materials used inside the BMW i3, the smartwatch comes with a matte black bezel and a special stamp on one of its sides, with the production number of the watch engraved. Since only 150 units will ever be made, the exclusive inscription makes them even more valuable. What sets this limited edition version apart from the rest of the Vector watches are the BMW i3 and BMW i8 inspired watch faces – that can be interchanged – as well as the leather strap that has the BMW i logo stamped and is made of the same leather used for the BMW i3. The same supplier was used by Vector to source the leather and with the agreement of BMW, the BMW i logo was integrated into it. Since both the BMW i3 and the Vector Luna watches are focused on efficiency, the collaboration between the two brands was bound to happen at one point. The watch is compatible with iOS, Android and Windows Phone operating systems and has over 100 different faces and apps available for download online. The phone’s pricing is about 600 Euros and it should be available online on various e-commerce websites starting today, even though sources inside BMW claim all of the 150 units have already been sold. BMWBLOG has also been working with Vector Watch to integrate our daily newsfeed with the watch, keeping you up to date with the latest info from the BMW world. That’s something regular Vector watches can’t do. The app for the BMWBLOG feed is still in beta but a stable version should be available shortly, as the manufacturer assured us. smartwatchVector Luna BMW i Limited EditionVector Watch Previous post The BMW 2 Series Active Tourer Is a Success Nobody’s Talking about Next post BMW 635CSi Group 2 Race Car Up for Grabs for €175,000 RECOMMENDED FOR YOU BMW’s Vehicular Small Cell Technology BMW Vehicular Small Cell will automatically connect all mobile devices inside the vehicle, including smartwatches and other smart devices Gesture control using smartwatch unlocks the BMW i3 Smartwatches and smartphones make it possible to easily use the future BMW i Connected Mobility dashboard on-the-go.

By and large, developers and professionals are unhappy with the fact that they patiently waited for years for a meaningful MacBook Pro upgrade only to see Apple deliver a machine that uses the 'Pro' moniker rather loosely. DON'T MISS: Best Buy has a great Black Friday Galaxy S7 deal you can use right now That notwithstanding, it is entirely possible that the controversy surrounding Apple's new MacBook Pro is much ado about nothing. Sure, a small minority of pro users who absolutely need 32GB of RAM no questions asked may be unhappy, but for the majority of customers who will end up buying the machine, it would appear that the new MacBook Pro is a lot more compelling than some are giving it credit for. Speaking to this point, professional video editor Thomas Carter recently took to The Huffington Post where he penned a mini-review of Apple's new MacBook Pro and came away rather impressed. For some additional context, Carter said that he's been using Apple's new Touch Bar equipped MacBook Pro for about a week on actual work-related video projects. As for the specs, which some critics have understandably called disappointing, Carter suggests we have nothing to worry about. First off, It’s really fast. I’ve been using the MacBook Pro with the new version of FCP X and cutting 5k ProRes material all week, it’s buttery smooth. No matter what you think the specs say, the fact is the software and hardware are so well integrated it tears strips off “superior spec’d” Windows counterparts in the real world. Of course, what people are mostly interested in is whether or not the vaunted Touch Bar is a gimmick or if it's actually huge step forward in usability. To this point, Carter leans towards the latter in what is the best encapsulation of the Touch Bar's utility I've seen yet. For years we’ve had single mouse inputs on a graphical user interface. Over time we’ve added more buttons and scroll wheels, trackpads with gestures. The Touch Bar takes this step further by allowing multiple inputs at the same time and combines well with the trackpad. The more I’ve used it the more I’ve replaced certain keyboard shortcuts. Why would I use dual-hand/multi-finger shortcuts if the button was there in front of me? And it’s contextual. It changes depending on what I’m doing. I’m editing picture; it shows me relevant trimming shortcuts. I’m editing titles; it shows me font, formatting and colour options. All without the need to open other menus. It works, it’s faster and it’s more productive. So while hardcore developers and professionals who need insanely tricked out machines may be understandably bummed by Apple's new MacBoo Pro, it really looks as if most everyone else will be more than thrilled with the machine. Indeed, Phil Schiller last week said that orders for Apple's new MacBook Pro with the Touch Bar are higher than what Apple has seen for "any other pro notebook before.” “So there certainly are a lot of people as excited as we are about it,” Schiller added. Carter's full take on the MacBook Pro can be seen via the source link below.

Multimedia Today's Paper Topics ePaper WealthCheck SEARCH Follow Home News Markets Companies Money & Banking Economy Info-tech Opinion Specials Portfolio Catalyst BLink Social Media Computers & Laptops Mobiles & Tablets Other Gadgets E-tailers defy diktat, sell refurbished mobiles Priyanka Pani comments   ·   print   ·   T+  ·   T- Tweet Radu Bercan/shutterstock.com In September, the Environment Ministry had issued a show-cause notice to several e-commerce players for dealing with refurbished phones. Popular mobile brands are being sold at heavily discounted prices Mumbai, November 11:   Despite the government’s diktat to handset makers to not sell refurbished or used phones, these products have made their way into the online channel. Several e-commerce players, such as Amazon, Overcart and eBay, are openly selling used or refurbished phones and the category is only growing. In September this year, the Environment Ministry had issued a show-cause notice to several e-commerce players, including Amazon.in and eBay, for dealing with refurbished and used mobile phones. However, two months since then, it is business as usual for these portals when it comes to selling refurbished phones. In fact, Amazon.in launched its refurbished category in September this year. It has Apple, Lenovo, Motorola, Samsung, Micromax and OnePlus as the most popular brands. The phones are available at heavily discounted prices and with a warranty from the seller and not from the companies. It is also important to mention here that Flipkart, which is an authorised marketplace for Apple, does not deal in used products. The Centre had this year turned down a proposal by Apple to sell refurbished phones in the country as it would clash with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ambitious “Make in India” initiative. Besides, it also would protect the country from being another “dumping ground for e-waste” by cell manufacturers. Apple, meanwhile, was looking at increasing its sales by selling pre-owned phones in the world’s largest mobile market by providing affordable products. While Apple declined any comment on whether the company was aware about the availability of used phones on e-commerce portals, an industry expert said that Apple deals with certified pre-owned phones, which is different from refurbished as Apple completely changes the old phones and converts them into “almost new” phones with a different IMEI number.‘No clear regulation’ “At present there is no clear regulation saying that selling of refurbished phones is illegal. However, the indication is that the government is completely against this,” said Jayanth Kolla, an IT and telecommunications analyst. He further added that while Apple and other companies would not be dealing with this directly, several third-party vendors and distributors, who have access to markets like China and Taiwan would be importing these devices through the grey market or other channels. Pankaj Mohindroo, National President of the Indian Cellular Association, told BusinessLine that while this is not a serious issue, the sellers dealing with refurbished phones require surveillance. Meanwhile, even as the government is yet to come out with clear guidelines with regard to refurbished phones, consumers seem quite happy as they get to use premium products at throw-away prices.Growing sales “The refurbished category has witnessed exponential growth. Within 10 months from December 2015, the category has seen 100X growth,” said Nitin Kocchar, V-P at Shopclues. He added that the refurbished mobiles have emerged as a leading category, not just for revenues but also driving positive margins for the category. On how the marketplaces are selling the refurbished products when they have been termed illegal, ShopClues said the company has been selling them for a year by creating a marketplace for refurbished sellers, who legally buy the used products and refurbish them. “Our unboxed category brands have a brand warranty and refurbished phones have a warranty provided by third-party companies.” Amazon did not respond to mails sent in this regard.

 Apple is still struggling to keep fake apps out of the App Store BI Intelligence Nov. 11, 2016, 10:50 AM 2,031 facebook linkedin twitter email print BI Intelligence See Also Here's what a Trump presidency means for mobile apps and platforms Shifting trends and priorities are set to transform the growing mPOS ecosystem CHATBOTS EXPLAINER: Conversation may power revenues for the next decade This story was delivered to BI Intelligence Apps and Platforms Briefing subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. After Apple had to purge several hundred malicious fake shopping apps from the iOS App Store earlier this week, the company’s security review process has been called into question. Apple often touts its security review process, which new apps must undergo before they can enter the App Store, as a significant advantage of the iOS ecosystem over its Android competitor. However, Apple does not actually review every single new app, according to The New York Times. This leaves it up to developers and brands to keep a watchful eye for fake apps masquerading as their own, as was the case with the hundreds of fake apps Apple recently removed. Apple told The New York Times that it encourages consumers and developers to report suspicious apps so it can quickly review them. Apple is in the midst of a campaign to review the more than 2 million apps in the App Store to remove malicious and outdated apps. Apple has historically had far less malicious code make its way into the App Store compared with Android’s Google Play store and third-party app stores. However, that has begun to change recently. In addition to the spate of fake retail apps, a number of fake apps related to the Pokemon Go mobile game hit the App Store after the game rose to popularity. This means brands and developers will likely need to be more vigilant going forward around threats to their customers stemming from fake apps. Cutting through the noise of an overcrowded app market is already critical for any app developer looking to build a viable user base, and that challenge becomes greater when malicious and fake apps flood the stores. There are now well over 3 million apps available across the world’s five largest app stores. Delivering the right product to the right audience at the right time in this environment is imperative to the success of any app. The challenge of marketing an app effectively has made app-install ads — an ad unit that directs users to download a mobile app — an essential tool for developers seeking to stand out in the Google Play and Apple app stores. This is why it's not surprising that more marketers are using paid channels to drive downloads than ever before. In fact, over 80% of respondents in a survey of the top 100 grossing mobile app developers noted they plan on increasing their spend on app-install ads in 2015. BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on mobile app-install ads that looks at the revenues from app-install ads and how they're expected to grow over the next five years. It also looks at the performance of app-install ads and how these metrics are expected to change over time. Furthermore, the report examines the top app-install ad products and pricing models offered by the leading advertising platforms, including Facebook, Twitter, Yahoo, and Google, as well as newer app-install formats from Instagram and Snapchat. Looking to the future, the report examines how companies are shifting their app-install ad spend to new formats, as well as the new tools they're using to improve optimization and ad effectiveness. Here are some key takeaways from the report: Mobile app-install ads — ad units that direct users to download a mobile app — are an essential tool for developers, and they account for a major share of mobile ad spend. We estimate 25% of total US mobile ad revenue was generated by app-install ads in 2015. A combination of new developers entering the space and rising ad budgets will drive increased spending in years to come. US app-install ad revenue will grow to over $7 billion by year-end 2020, according to BI Intelligence estimates. Mobile app install advertisers have traditionally invested heavily in display and interstitial ads, but are moving to mobile video and native install formats. 86% of developers currently use in-feed video app-install ads, and video ads are seen as the most effective app-install format. As formats like video rise in popularity, older formats are losing their appeal for install campaigns. Static nonnative ads are widely used but are not seen as effective. Free app networks and offer walls have also fallen out of favor. Ad platforms are now developing innovative new install formats to earn even more revenue from these lucrative ad units. New approaches, including deep linking and app streaming, are more contextualized and interactive than older ad formats. In full, the report: Forecasts app-install ad spending in the US through 2020.

Fox News Fox Business Fox News Latino Fox News Go Fox News Radio Fox Nation Fox News Insider Fox News Tech Expand/Collapse Search Home Video Politics U.S. Opinion Business Entertainment Tech Science Health Travel Lifestyle World On Air Tech Home Computers Google Video Games Military Tech War Games Slideshows Apple Is the iPhone 7 Plus better than past generations? By Brooke Crothers Published November 11, 2016 FoxNews.com Facebook0 Twitter0 livefyre Email Print iPhone 7 Plus (Apple) Is the larger iPhone 7 really a meaningful upgrade from the iPhone 6s Plus? Read on. The most striking thing about the iPhone 7s Plus— the 5.5-inch Plus is the larger of the two new phones— is just how similar it is physically to the iPhone 6 Plus introduced in 2014. Ditto on the iPhone 6s Plus, introduced last year. In fact, I’m guessing the non-geek, average consumer couldn’t tell the difference between all three— even after using them. I’ve owned all three and recently switched to the 7 Plus. Here are my impressions. Camera: It’s Apple’s best yet. I’ve compared photos from my iPhone 6s Plus and iPhone 7 Plus and the latter produces better photos in low-light. I take most of my photos in low-light or ambient room light and the iPhone 7 Plus camera renders more accurate colors and detail. But I have to look hard. The difference isn’t going to jump out at you. And, again, the average consumer (non-photography buff) probably wouldn’t notice.   APPLE UNVEILS NEW IPHONES: THE IPHONE 7 AND 7 PLUS I’m trying not to carp. Enthusiasts who obsess about image quality will definitely notice. And it's important to note that camera quality doesn’t improve in big leaps. It’s incremental. So, hats off to Apple for continuing to make its iPhone cameras good enough that most consumers can ditch their stand-alone DSLRs. (I ditched my pricey DSLR when I got the iPhone 5s.) There is one thing that everyone will notice, however, novices and experts alike: the “telephoto” capability that is only available on the iPhone 7 Plus. The telephoto technology uses two lenses (versus one on the smaller iPhone 7).  In short, up to 2X, you get higher-quality zoom. I definitely noticed this right away. The novice will too. No headphone jack: The sole Lightning connector on the iPhone 7 is a game changer. This didn’t hit me until, out of habit, I sat down and unthinkingly tried to plug my old headphones into the iPhone 7 Plus. At that moment, I also realized that I had probably a half a dozen headphones with old-style 3.5mm jacks that I couldn’t use with iPhone 7 Plus without an adapter. And, tangentially, I noticed that using the Lighting headphones with the Lightning port on my iPad Pro doesn’t work for me because it blocks easy access to the home button. That doesn’t bode well for future iPads unless Apple changes the position of the Lightning connector. IS APPLE WORKING ON THE BIGGEST IPHONE GAME-CHANGER EVER? That said, it’s progress. Everyone hates it when technology changes. But after the initial temper tantrum, most people soon forget what all the fuss was about. That will apply to the headphone jack-less iPhone 7 too. Solid-state home button: I welcome the switch to a solid-state home button from the mechanical one on all previous iPhones. And I expect all Apple iOS devices to adopt solid-state buttons. It provides better feedback, is more responsive, and just plain easier to use. Battery life: While I haven’t done exact down-to-the-minute comparisons, generally, after weeks of use, I haven’t noticed a difference – good or bad – between the iPhone 7 Plus and my previous iPhone 6s Plus. And I don’t think the average buyer will be either disappointed by or ecstatic over the iPhone 7 Plus’ battery life. It generally lasts all day unless I’m traveling and using it constantly all day. In the latter case, it needs recharging before the day is out. APPLE OFFERS DEALS ON IPHONES, MACBOOKS, AND MORE Performance: I do notice subtle speed improvements. Though the iPhone 7 packs a new Apple A10 processor, I believe a good chunk of the speed boost comes from the 3GB of RAM in the 7 Plus – that’s 1GB more than the 2GB of the smaller iPhone 7. As anyone who has done a DIY upgrade of a PC knows, if you add RAM, everything gets snappier. That applies to mobile devices too. Water resistance: I have not tested the improved water resistance and will only do so if I’m forced to. Apple doesn't cover water damage under the standard warranty. So, I’m not going to push my luck. But tech sites have done lots of testing so I’ll refer you to in-depth testing. And some tests, by the way, showed that damage did occur. To wrap up, is the iPhone 7 a major improvement over the iPhone 6s? No. And it's not light years ahead of the iPhone 6 either. That said, if you obsess about photo quality, need better water resistance, and insist on having the fastest iPhone, it's worth the upgrade.

Here’s how to protect yours before it’s too late. Use encryption. by April Glaser Nov 10, 2016, 5:11pm EST tweet share Linkedin Spencer Platt / Getty Images Donald Trump doesn’t like encryption. He threatened to call for a boycott of Apple products because they wouldn’t undermine the encryption on the iPhone. Trump also loves surveillance. When he was a candidate, he said he wanted to place mosques under U.S. surveillance and create a national database to track Muslims. He is also in favor of NSA mass surveillance. And on the topic of hacking his enemies, Trump said, “I wish I had that power. Man, that would be power.” As president, he will have that power. Edward Snowden has revealed that the United States already engages in mass digital surveillance of Americans. But the federal government has gone to great lengths to keep its domestic surveillance operation under wraps, getting broad clearance through secret court orders issued by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Court. Under Trump, that surveillance is likely to be a lot more overt. But the ability to have private conversations, to research controversial topics without fear of government reprisal and to engage in political activism and organizing are all key functions of American democracy. If you’re concerned about expanded surveillance, there are a number of privacy-enhancing tips and products you can try that will help keep your digital footprint under wraps. Texts and phone calls Leaks have shown that the NSA and the FBI are capable of intercepting text message and phone data. To keep your text messages private, use a service that offers end-to-end encryption. Apple’s iMessages does this, but only between iMessage users — if you text someone who’s on an Android phone, those messages won’t have the same protection. Signal, a popular encrypted text messaging app Snowden recommends, and Facebook’s WhatsApp, are other options. And both of them work on Apple as well as Android phones. Like iMessage, both parties of the text conversation need to have the app installed for the encryption to work. Internet search data If you want to keep your internet search queries private, try installing Tor, an internet browser that anonymizes your activity by routing the data through multiple destinations before sending it out onto the worldwide web. There are also tools like HTTPS Everywhere, a browser extension which helps to encrypt connections between websites. Two-factor authentication and updates Passwords are hackable, especially if you reuse the same one over and over, like many people do. Don’t do that. One thing you should do to protect your privacy is enable two-factor authentication for all of your accounts. Most services offer the option to text a code to a phone number on file for your account, so only someone with both your password and your cellphone can access it. Also, make sure all your apps and services are fully updated to take advantage of any recent security improvements. recode_divider In this Storystream Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump: Presidential election 2016 Donald Trump says his tweeting as president will be ‘very restrained,’ even as he trolls the New York Times today Trump will be a disaster for online privacy.

Orange Cash offers contactless mobile payments based on a prepaid account with a digital Visa card, issued by Wirecard Card Solutions. The digital card will be provisioned through an app-to-wallet interface directly into Wallet. Customers don’t need to scan a plastic card and run through additional verification processes, thus making the on-boarding process very user-friendly while ensuring high security standards. Security and privacy is at the core of Apple Pay. When using a credit or debit card with Apple Pay, the actual card numbers are not stored on the device, nor on Apple servers. Instead, a unique Device Account Number is assigned, encrypted and securely stored in the Secure Element on your device. Each transaction is authorised with a one-time unique dynamic security code. Nicolas Lévi, Director Payments and Mobile Financial Services at Orange, said in a statement: “With Wirecard on our side, a leading specialist in the field of mobile payment, we found a strong partner. We are driven by our desire to further expand mobile payment coverage on the market. Our innovative spirit helps us to develop the most useful and advanced services for our customers, we believe Apple Pay is just that.” Orange Cash offers one-tap, real-time loyalty and couponing deals from participating retailers through Wirecard’s Card-Linked Offers platform. “By supporting the launch of Orange Cash with Apple Pay in France, for the first time customers with iPhone 6 and later can also benefit from couponing and loyalty deals while using mobile payments. An easy-to-handle one-tap solution for payment and benefits guarantees Orange customers using iPhone 6 and later a smart shopping experience. Together with Orange we are offering the first app-to-wallet provisioning of an Apple Pay solution with Visa in Europe, which makes us proud,” said Brigitte Häuser-Axtner, Executive Vice President Sales Digital Goods with Wirecard, in a statement. Apple Pay is easy to set up and users will continue to receive all of the rewards and beneﬁts offered by credit and debit cards. In France, Apple Pay works with iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus and later, iPhone SE and Apple Watch. Source: Wirecard MacDailyNews Take: Félicitations, France!

Comments Computerworld | Nov 11, 2016 6:54 AM PT RELATED TOPICS Apple Mac MacOS Computer Hardware Apple MacBook Pro Mac Pro Comments Apple’s new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar notebooks swiftly surpassed sales of almost every other decent quality notebook in the first five days availability. Early adopters, adopt Apple has raised its part and component orders with its supply chain partners, telling them that it expects strong shipments to continue until at least the end of the year. Apple’s senior VP Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, recently said: “We are proud to tell you that so far our online store has had more orders for the new MacBook Pro than any other pro notebook before. So there are certainly a lot of people as excited as we are about it." Slice Intelligence notes Apple has struck a chord with early adopters once again with this release. “Those who ordered the new MacBook Pro look strikingly similar to the early adopters who bought the Apple Watch on release,” they say. Touch Bar’s magic touch Interest in the new Macs appears to be driven by the introduction of the new Touch Bar, which is attracting attention among early adopters who are keen to put it through its paces. The Touch Bar replaces the function keys with an OLED MultiTouch glass bar. The bar displays contextual keyboard commands, sliders and other control graphics in response to which application you are in and what you are doing within that application. You may find quick and easy access to image editing tools in Photos or deeply nested commands when working on a Word document, for example. Thomas Grove Carter, a professional video editor who uses Final Cut Pro X at London’s Trim Editing writes: “The more I’ve used [the Touch Bar] the more I’ve replaced certain keyboard shortcuts. Why would I use dual-hand/multi-finger shortcuts if the button was there in front of me? And it’s contextual. It changes depending on what I’m doing. I’m editing picture; it shows me relevant trimming shortcuts. I’m editing titles; it shows me font, formatting and color options.” Love or loathe? Will you like it? There are some who argue that the Touch Bar reflects that many developers insist on hiding controls and options from view, but this has always been the case on every platform. What the Touch Bar enables users to do is to gain an almost instant grasp of how to get things done in almost any application, as commands that may have been harder to find are rendered far more obvious through the contextual device. This means every Mac user should be able to be more productive in any app, thanks to the contextual guide provided by the device. What next? While Apple claims it still remains committed to desktop Macs, it has been over 1,000 days since the company upgraded the Mac Pro. This has generated much concern among Mac users. Given the company’s apparent plan to introduce AR experiences it is worth noting that existing VR systems, such as the HTC Vive demand a lot of computational power. Is it possible future Mac desktops have been delayed as part of the company’s AR deployment plan? I don’t know, but I can easily imagine contextual user interfaces such as the Touch Bar will be very important components of future AR interfaces, as the introduction of contextual computing experiences will need to be matched by depth within the control systems for those experiences. This makes it likely we’ll see external Touch Bar devices for some Macs, I guess. Try it today We don’t have such peripherals yet, but Andreas Verhoeven and Robbert Klarenbeek have created an app that creates a kind of virtual onscreen Touch Bar on any Mac. You can download the software at Github. It’s not perfect and installation is a little troublesome, but it does provide a nice insight into what Touch Bar does. In future all user interfaces may be this way. Google+?

The uptick in delayed reporting contributed to almost 3,000 publicly data breaches this year alone -- exposing more than 2.2 billion records. And the year isn't even over yet. Even as we approach December 31, there's no sign of it ending. Let's take a look back at some of the biggest -- and most dangerous -- hacks and leaks so far. THIS YEAR IN HACKS MySpace hack puts another 427 million passwords up for sale A hacker claims to be selling millions of Twitter accounts One of the biggest hacks happened last year, but nobody noticed 171 million VK.com accounts stolen by hackers Hacker puts 51 million file sharing accounts for sale on dark web Ubuntu Forums hack exposes 2 million users Oracle investigating data breach at Micros point-of-sale division Epic's forums hacked again, with thousands of logins stolen Millions of Steam game keys stolen after hacker breaches gaming site Hackers stole 43 million Last.fm account details in 2012 breach Published: November 15, 2016 -- 15:40 GMT (07:40 PST) Photo by: file photo Caption by: Zack Whittaker FBI hacked terrorist's iPhone 5c Should Apple help the FBI unlock a terrorist's phone? Apple said yes, but not at the expense of everyone else's security and privacy. The FBI brought a case against Apple to compel it to help its agents break into the iPhone of one of the San Bernardino shooters, who killed 14 people and injured dozens in the terrorist attack in December. Apple refused to help the feds "backdoor" its own product, arguing that it can't crack the encryption, and lodged a formal appeal. The FBI eventually buckled under public pressure, but not before hiring hackers to break into the phone at the last minute. It set in motion a chain reaction of proposed laws and measures to try to ensure that Apple could never be above the law.

That in part made it the target by one hacker, who inserted a backdoor in the operating system and hacked the project's website to trick users into downloading the malicious version. Hundreds of users downloaded the affected build. The hacker, who goes by the name of Peace (who was instrumental in other hacks) explained how he did it.

After learning how the system worked, the cyberattackers took the bank's SWIFT code and made a series of transaction requests for cash to be sent from the country's New York-based account to entities across Asia. It was shoddy security at its worst, but lessons were eventually learned.

The alleged billionaire's hotel chain was attacked twice in as many years -- including once in April. It's not all surprising given that his organization was using horribly insecure and unpatched systems that dated back more than a decade. Then, Trump's presidential campaign leaked the resumes of prospective interns, including their names, addresses, and in some cases sensitive employment details. Let's hope his cybersecurity strategy is better when he's in office.

LinkedIn was the first of many hack records that was met (and later surpassed) this year. The business networking company was first hit in 2012, but the scale of the attack was only realized this year when the number of records stolen shot up by almost twenty-fold to 117 million accounts. If that wasn't bad enough, most of the passwords were ridiculously bad -- like "123456" and "linkedin." The alleged hacker was eventually caught in the Czech Republic.

But until recently, not many had heard of Myspace in some time. Sadly, for many, it was bad news. A massive hack led 427 million accounts stolen early in the year. The company, now owned by Time Inc., had at the time of the breach, just 50 million visitors per month -- a significant drop from its heyday, but nevertheless a reminder that security can come back to haunt.

US chief spy James Clapper said that the intelligence community believed that "based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized" hacking activities, such as email leaks on the Democratic campaign. Senior Democrats eventually resigned, and Hillary Clinton's email campaign suffered irreparably -- as the election result proved.

Thanks to a previous leak of Snowden files, reporters confirmed the exploits belonged to the US government.

Oracle said that the hackers responsible for the breach installed malware on the support portal in an effort to scrape usernames and passwords as they were entered. Those account credentials may be used to remotely administer and access point-of-sale devices located in customers' retail outlets. Oracle bought the company in 2014 for $5.3 billion.

Harold Martin, a former staffer, stole 50 terabytes of data from the agency, most of it classified. The breach vastly eclipsed what Edward Snowden stole -- thought to be a little over 50,000 files. Though Wilson was initially charged with mishandling classified information, the scale of his theft bumped the charges up to espionage. How did he get all that data through the NSA? By simply walking out the door, sources said.

 Next year's iPhone is going to have an even bigger screen Kif Leswing Nov. 11, 2016, 9:24 AM 11,693 facebook linkedin twitter email print YouTube/ConceptsiPhone Apple is preparing iPhones with bigger screens for a launch next year.  Although the iPhone 8 design isn't final yet, Barclays analysts Blayne Curtis and Christopher Hemmelgarn provided some new details about Apple's next iPhone in a note distributed to clients on Friday. The analysts are citing supply chain sources spoken to during a trip to Asia.  "iPhone 8 design didn't sound 100% locked down but we believe the move is to a bezel-less design with screen sizes getting larger and curved edges in the original envelope. The IP8 moves to 5" (from 4.7") and the Plus moves to 5.8" (from 5.5")," the analysts write. The mentions of 5-inch and 5.8-inch iPhones lines up with previous reports from Nikkei and KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.  The phones may stay the same size while the screens get bigger, thanks to less space around the screen."We believe Apple is looking to increase the screen sizes with zero bezel such that they will still fit in the same size" casings, the Barclays analysts wrote.  "Maybe the low-end moves to 4.7" [screen] with the new larger sizes coming," they continued.  Only the Plus model will have an OLED screen, a newer type of display technology with better color and deeper blacks, the analysts wrote. Most of the OLEDs will come from Samsung and LG, according to the report.  That's because of supply issues, they say, and the industry expects Foxconn's subsidiary Sharp to get its factories up and running in 2018. "By using a plastic OLED screen, the screen can bend at the edges to allow a curved bezel-less edge," the analysts wrote. The report also suggests that Apple's Force Touch feature may change to a "film-based solution" from the current "flexible PCB" technology that the iPhone 7 uses.  The analysts also had some new iPad predictions based on their trip to Asia. We're expecting Apple's iPhone 8 to be a major redesign to coincide with the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, and Barclays' predictions line up with what we've been hearing. The iPhone 8, or iPhone 10, depending on what Apple decides to call it, could have glass casing, wireless charging, and other new features.  SEE ALSO: A top Foxconn exec talked about the iPhone 8 in a public speech SEE ALSO: Expect new iPads in March with 'borderless' screens NOW WATCH: Here's how Donald Trump can function on barely any sleep — and why you shouldn't copy him Loading video...

(Photo: Raya Hristova, Getty Images/iStockphoto) Q: All the news about hacking has started to freak me out. Did the hackers use a sophisticated attack to go after John Podesta’s email? A: No, they did not. These hackers used one of the oldest tricks in the book. Podesta allegedly received an email from Google that alerted him, “Someone has your password.” It was a classic phishing email that enticed him to hand over his new password to the hackers at a bogus site. Emails published by Wikileaks appear to show Podesta was not using two-factor authentication, a security feature available on several platforms including Google and Facebook. Click here for more about the hacking and the steps you should take now, so you don’t become a victim. Q: I have two pre-teens and just purchased an Apple TV. I’m new to this kind of viewing. Is there a way to censor what they watch? A: Yes, you can adjust the settings so that your children aren’t exposed to mature content based on film or age ratings. With Apple TV, it’s simple to set up. From the main menu, go to Settings > General > Restrictions. The system will ask you for a four-digit passcode so that your kids can’t switch it off without you knowing. It’s just as easy to turn off the restrictions when the youngsters are in bed and you have a hankering for Game of Thrones. Many people don’t know that with the right apps, you can turn your TV into a classic art display or earth viewing station. It’s very cool! Click here for three apps that you’ll love on your Apple TV. Q: I finally finished my novel, and I want to test it out as an ebook. I’m thinking of putting it on Kindle, but I’m not sure if it’s a good deal. Any suggestions? A: Many authors are publishing ebooks because they’re economical and easy to distribute. You can often reach a global audience within 24 hours. KDP is Amazon’s ebook self-publishing service, and it’s very powerful. As always, make sure to read the contract carefully, but the deal is pretty good: You can publish through Kindle exclusively and earn up to 70% royalties, or you can publish through Kindle and other services, like Apple’s iBooks, and earn up to 30% royalties. Of course, there is much more to know. Click here for a step-by-step guide to publishing your ebook and making money at it. Q: I love my iPhone, but my husband loves Android. I am in the market for a new car but I only want a car with Apple CarPlay. Who manufactures cars that have Apple CarPlay? A: Apple CarPlay automatically syncs a car with an iPhone. It lets you use certain apps through an in-dash display, rather than on the phone itself. In fact, the system syncs up to the designated phone without having to remove it from your purse or pocket. You can get directions, make phone calls, send and receive messages, and listen to music. Apple CarPlay is included in a slew of cars from Acura to Volvo. Click here for a complete list of cars with Apple CarPlay for you and Android Auto for your husband. Q: I am a tattoo artist. I saw the Facebook Live videos of your show. I would like to show on Facebook live videos of my work. How do I get started? A: Live-streaming is the new way to express yourself and show the world what’s going on in your life. Using a smartphone or tablet, your circle of friends, family, customers, business associates or fans see you in live video and audio over the internet. Open the Facebook app on your smartphone or tablet. Go to your profile and open up the status bar. You’ll see the “What’s on my mind?” prompt and towards the bottom, select “Live Video.” From there, it’s a series of steps that I have written up in detail.

While the initial delivery window for early buyers ranged from November 17 to November 25, we're now seeing reports that Apple is preparing some units for delivery as early as November 11. DON'T MISS: Target Black Friday 2016 ad leaks: Huge iPhone 7, Xbox One S, TV, and other tech deals That being the case, we can expect some early adopters to start receiving Apple's revamped MacBook Pro as early as this weekend with many more deliveries expected to arrive on doorsteps before November 17. Over the last few weeks, Apple's new MacBook Pro has been absolutely eviscerated from developers and professionals. From complaints about the device's USB C ports and lack of an SD Card reader to complaints about a 16GB RAM limit and less than impressive internals, one would be forgiven for thinking that Apple's next-gen notebook was destined to be a flop. The reality, though, is that most Mac users appear to be excited for Apple's new Touch Bar MacBook Pro. To this point, Apple's Phil Schiller said earlier this month that Apple has seen "more orders for the new MacBook Pro than any other pro notebook before." “So there certainly are a lot of people as excited as we are about it," Schiller added. On a related note, early figures from Slice Intelligence suggest that the new MacBook Pro is selling like hotcakes. We'll of course no more once Apple releases its earnings report in January, but for now it would appear that the Mac is not only far from dead, but may be thriving.

Nov 11, 2016, 08:45 ET Share this article NEW YORK, Nov. 11, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Network-1 Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: NTIP) today announced financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2016.  Network-1 had the largest quarterly revenues in its history with revenue of $34,326,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared with revenue of $3,008,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase in revenue of $31,318,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, was due primarily to additional licensing revenue of $31,000,000 from settlement and licensing agreements entered into with Apple Inc. and Dell, Inc. during the quarter.   Revenue from royalty bearing licenses for patents decreased $232,000 or 14% from $1,658,000 to $1,426,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. Network-1 had revenue of $59,963,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to revenue of $10,382,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase in revenue of $49,581,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was due primarily to additional licensing revenue of $31,000,000 from settlement and licensing agreements  with Apple Inc., and Dell, Inc. as well as a $17,500,000 settlement of a professional liability claim.   Revenue from royalty bearing licenses for patents increased $70,000 or 1% from $8,593,000 to $8,663,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Network-1 reported net income of $10,832,000 or $0.46 per share (basic) and $0.43 per share (diluted) for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared with net income of $407,000 or $0.02 per share (basic and diluted) for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  Network-1 reported net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $22,882,000 or $0.98 per share (basic) and $0.93 per share (diluted) as compared with net income of $1,717,000 or $0.07 per share (basic and diluted) for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  At September 30, 2016, Network-1 had cash and cash equivalents of $57,759,000 and working capital of $50,179,000.  Subsequent to the end of the third quarter, Network-1 entered into settlement and license agreements aggregating $5,000,000, a portion of which will be recorded as revenue for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. Network-1 incurred current Federal, state and local income taxes of $3,817,000 and $26,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively.  The increase of $3,791,000 in such taxes was related to Network-1's full utilization of NOLs during the three months ended September 30, 2016 in connection with significant net income.  In September 2011, Network-1 initiated patent litigation against sixteen (16) data networking equipment manufacturers in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Tyler Division, for infringement of its Remote Power Patent. Network-1 has now reached settlement and license agreements with twelve (12) of the original defendants.  The remaining four defendants in the lawsuit are Avaya Inc., AXIS Communications Inc., Hewlett-Packard Company, and Juniper Networks, Inc. Network-1 seeks monetary damages based upon reasonable royalties.  The litigation is currently scheduled for trial in 2017. The Remote Power Patent relates to, among other things, delivering power over Ethernet cables to remotely power network connected devices including, among others, wireless access points, VoIP telephones and network cameras.  In June 2003, the IEEE approved the 802.3af PoE Standard, which led to the rapid adoption of PoE.  The IEEE also approved the 802.3at Power over Ethernet Plus (PoE Plus) Standard, which increased the maximum power delivered to network devices to 40-60 watts from the current 15 watts under the 802.3af Standard. Network-1 currently has twenty-five (25) license agreements with respect to its Remote Power Patent, which include, among others, license agreements with Cisco Systems, Inc., Extreme Networks, Inc., Dell, Inc., Netgear Inc., Alcatel-Lucent USA, Sony Corporation, Shoretel Inc., Microsemi Corporation, Motorola Solutions, Inc., NEC Corporation, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., and several other data networking vendors. On April 4, 2014 and December 3, 2014, Network-1 initiated litigation against Google Inc. and YouTube, LLC in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York for infringement of several of its patents which relate to the identification of media content on the Internet.  The lawsuits allege that Google and YouTube have infringed and continue to infringe certain of the Company's patents by making, using, selling and offering to sell unlicensed systems and related products and services, which include YouTube's Content ID system.  In December 2014, Google Inc. filed four petitions to institute Inter Partes Review (the "IPRs") at the United States Patent and Trademark Office ("USPTO") pertaining to patents asserted in the litigation. In each of the four IPRs Google sought to invalidate certain claims of the patents at issue within the Cox Patent Portfolio. On June 21, 2016, the PTAB issued its Final Written Decision in the four pending IPRs finding eighty-six (86) claims "not unpatentable" (valid) and, in total, one hundred and nineteen (119) out of one hundred and twenty-nine (129) or 92% of the challenged claims of the patents have survived Google's challenges in the IPRs.  None of the claims of the patents being asserted in the pending litigations against Google and YouTube were found invalid. On August 18, 2016, Google filed Notices of Appeal to appeal the Final Written Decisions on the IPRs to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. On April 13, 2015, Google filed a Petition for Covered Business Method Review (CBM) at the PTAB seeking to invalidate claims pertaining to Network-1's U.S. Patent No. 8,904,464, the patent asserted in the Company's litigation against Google and YouTube filed on December 3, 2014 as referenced above.  On October 19, 2015, the PTAB issued an order instituting the Covered Business Method Review on certain grounds. The oral hearing took place on May 11, 2016.  On October 18, 2016, the PTAB issued its Final Written Decision in favor of Network-1 with respect to the CBM and ruled that Google had failed to show that any of the thirty-four (34) claims of the Company's patent at issue were unpatentable.

Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Nov 11, 2016 at 8:21AM With the market near all-time highs, it can be tough to find "cheap" tech stocks worth starting new positions in. However, three well-known tech stocks -- IBM (NYSE:IBM), Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) -- all still trade at steep discounts to the S&P 500's P/E of 23 and their industry averages. Let's take a look at why investors don't seem interested in these three tech giants, and why they could be great long-term plays at current prices. Image source: Pixabay. IBM IBM currently trades at 13 times trailing earnings, which is much lower than the average P/E of 21 for the IT services industry. IBM's 13% gain has outperformed the S&P 500's 4% gain this year, but that rally was likely fueled by its 3.7% forward yield in a low interest rate environment instead of any notable strengths in its business. IBM has hiked its dividend, which is comfortably supported by its payout ratio of 44%, for 16 consecutive years. Big Blue's main problem is its lack of revenue growth. Its quarterly revenue has fallen year-over-year for 18 consecutive quarters due to rising competition and sluggish enterprise demand for its aging IT services, software, and hardware. IBM's core strategy is to offset those declines with its higher-growth "strategic imperatives" (cloud, analytics, mobility, social, and security) businesses. Revenue from those businesses rose 16% annually to $8 billion last quarter, and accounted for 40% of IBM's trailing-12-month revenue. Unfortunately, that growth didn't fully offset the weakness of its other businesses, which caused its total revenue to dip 0.4% annually. Looking ahead, IBM's painful shift away from older products toward higher-growth ones should eventually pay off. Analysts still expect IBM's revenues to fall through 2017, but its earnings -- boosted by buybacks and a shift toward higher-margin services -- should improve 3.5% next year. It's a long road back for IBM, but its low multiple and high dividend should set a floor under the stock. Baidu Baidu, China's largest search engine, trades at just 13 times trailing earnings, which is much lower than the industry average P/E of 50 for internet information providers. Shares of Baidu have slumped 9% this year due to concerns about its spending and new regulations for its ads. To remain competitive in the rapidly evolving Chinese internet market, Baidu has been adding O2O (online-to-offline) features -- like mobile payments, ride hailing, ticket bookings, and restaurant reservations -- to its core app. These investments are expected to cause its earnings to decline 12% this year. Baidu's top line has been weighed down by more strict regulations regarding ads for healthcare services and pharmaceutical products. The sale of its stake in online travel agency Qunar to Ctrip further distorted year-over-year comparisons. As a result,  Baidu's revenue is expected to rise just 6% this year, compared to 35% growth in 2015. But looking further ahead to 2017, Baidu is expected to post 21% sales growth and 33% earnings growth as its O2O investments start paying off. Apple Despite being the most valuable company in the world by market cap, Apple trades at just 13 times trailing earnings -- a discount to the industry average of 17 for electronic equipment makers. The stock has barely outperformed the S&P 500, with a 5% gain this year, mainly due to ongoing concerns about sales of the iPhone, which generated 60% of the company sales last quarter. Image source: Apple. Shipments of iPhones, iPads, and Macs all fell annually last quarter, causing Apple to post its first year-over-year revenue decline since 2001. Apple's response has been to diversify its hardware business with the Apple Watch, and its services business with Apple Music, Apple Pay, and other software platforms. But these businesses still only generate a small portion of the tech giant's overall revenues. But looking ahead, Apple still has plenty of cash to spend on acquisitions, buybacks, and dividends to keep investors interested. New acquisitions could reduce the weight of its hardware business and give Apple new pillars of growth. Buybacks could boost its earnings growth, and its forward yield of 2% (supported by a low payout ratio of 26%) could easily be doubled to attract income investors. It's tough to see what comes next for Apple, but I certainly wouldn't bet against the tech giant's long-term prospects. Patience pays off... Investors should remember that stocks generally have low P/Es because investors aren't eager to buy them. However, investing in companies with sound long-term growth prospects while their stocks are at low multiples could pay off over the long run. There's no guarantee that investors will suddenly fall in love with IBM, Baidu, or Apple again, but I believe the potential rewards outweigh the risks at their current prices.   Leo Sun has no position in any stocks mentioned.

The search giant removed the feature from the final release of Nougat after giving an early glimpse in a developer preview for Nexus devices as the feature was not completely ready. Now, the 'Night Mode' will reportedly be making its way back to Nexus devices in the upcoming Nougat 7.1 update. After the feature was removed from the final build of Nougat, a thread named "Bring Back Night Mode" was posted on company's issue tracker. Now, the search giant has changed its status to 'Future Release', as pointed out by Phandroid. This indicates that the night mode is likely to come back in a future release, possibly the upcoming Android 7.1 Nougat update. Of course users might have to wait for longer if the company decides to push out the feature with a future update.The 'Night Mode' essentially adjusts the screen colour temperature in order to prevent excessive strain on user's eyes. There have always been apps that can help users adjust the screen colour temperature, such as f.lux, but system-level integration makes this feature extremely useful. Regarding the removal of night mode features in the Android N, a team of Google Engineers had earlier revealed that both dark theme and screen tinting had to be abandoned for similar reasons. The team claimed that both these were not going to be ready by the time Android N was launched publicly. Further, the team said that it did not want to leave a "half-working" feature in the platform. The team pointed out that the implementation on an ecosystem-wide scale was difficult, and work on the features was not judged to be a sound allocation of resources.

Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Nov 11, 2016 at 8:21AM With the market near all-time highs, it can be tough to find "cheap" tech stocks worth starting new positions in. However, three well-known tech stocks -- IBM (NYSE:IBM), Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) -- all still trade at steep discounts to the S&P 500's P/E of 23 and their industry averages. Let's take a look at why investors don't seem interested in these three tech giants, and why they could be great long-term plays at current prices. Image source: Pixabay. IBM IBM currently trades at 13 times trailing earnings, which is much lower than the average P/E of 21 for the IT services industry. IBM's 13% gain has outperformed the S&P 500's 4% gain this year, but that rally was likely fueled by its 3.7% forward yield in a low interest rate environment instead of any notable strengths in its business. IBM has hiked its dividend, which is comfortably supported by its payout ratio of 44%, for 16 consecutive years. Big Blue's main problem is its lack of revenue growth. Its quarterly revenue has fallen year-over-year for 18 consecutive quarters due to rising competition and sluggish enterprise demand for its aging IT services, software, and hardware. IBM's core strategy is to offset those declines with its higher-growth "strategic imperatives" (cloud, analytics, mobility, social, and security) businesses. Revenue from those businesses rose 16% annually to $8 billion last quarter, and accounted for 40% of IBM's trailing-12-month revenue. Unfortunately, that growth didn't fully offset the weakness of its other businesses, which caused its total revenue to dip 0.4% annually. Looking ahead, IBM's painful shift away from older products toward higher-growth ones should eventually pay off. Analysts still expect IBM's revenues to fall through 2017, but its earnings -- boosted by buybacks and a shift toward higher-margin services -- should improve 3.5% next year. It's a long road back for IBM, but its low multiple and high dividend should set a floor under the stock. Baidu Baidu, China's largest search engine, trades at just 13 times trailing earnings, which is much lower than the industry average P/E of 50 for internet information providers. Shares of Baidu have slumped 9% this year due to concerns about its spending and new regulations for its ads. To remain competitive in the rapidly evolving Chinese internet market, Baidu has been adding O2O (online-to-offline) features -- like mobile payments, ride hailing, ticket bookings, and restaurant reservations -- to its core app. These investments are expected to cause its earnings to decline 12% this year. Baidu's top line has been weighed down by more strict regulations regarding ads for healthcare services and pharmaceutical products. The sale of its stake in online travel agency Qunar to Ctrip further distorted year-over-year comparisons. As a result,  Baidu's revenue is expected to rise just 6% this year, compared to 35% growth in 2015. But looking further ahead to 2017, Baidu is expected to post 21% sales growth and 33% earnings growth as its O2O investments start paying off. Apple Despite being the most valuable company in the world by market cap, Apple trades at just 13 times trailing earnings -- a discount to the industry average of 17 for electronic equipment makers. The stock has barely outperformed the S&P 500, with a 5% gain this year, mainly due to ongoing concerns about sales of the iPhone, which generated 60% of the company sales last quarter. Image source: Apple. Shipments of iPhones, iPads, and Macs all fell annually last quarter, causing Apple to post its first year-over-year revenue decline since 2001. Apple's response has been to diversify its hardware business with the Apple Watch, and its services business with Apple Music, Apple Pay, and other software platforms. But these businesses still only generate a small portion of the tech giant's overall revenues. But looking ahead, Apple still has plenty of cash to spend on acquisitions, buybacks, and dividends to keep investors interested. New acquisitions could reduce the weight of its hardware business and give Apple new pillars of growth. Buybacks could boost its earnings growth, and its forward yield of 2% (supported by a low payout ratio of 26%) could easily be doubled to attract income investors. It's tough to see what comes next for Apple, but I certainly wouldn't bet against the tech giant's long-term prospects. Patience pays off... Investors should remember that stocks generally have low P/Es because investors aren't eager to buy them. However, investing in companies with sound long-term growth prospects while their stocks are at low multiples could pay off over the long run. There's no guarantee that investors will suddenly fall in love with IBM, Baidu, or Apple again, but I believe the potential rewards outweigh the risks at their current prices.   Leo Sun has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady Apple improves shipping delivery estimates for some Touch Bar-equipped MacBook Pro buyers, changes status to “now shipping” in certain cases Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Friday, November 11th, 2016, 05:53 Category: MacBook Pro, News, retail, Touch Bar Tweet The first of the Touch Bar-equpped MacBook Pro units look as if they’re about to ship on Friday, November 11th. A number of users have reported that Apple has started changing the status of several preorders from “processing” to “preparing for shipment”, which typically happens in the days before it ships and delivers orders to customers. Reports from the first preorder customers estimated a ship date of November 11th, while others were quickly notified that their orders had been pushed back 2-3 weeks to 4-5 weeks after the units became available via the Apple online storefront. That means that the first MacBook Pro with Touch Bar models could arrive in customers’ hands as soon as this week in markets where next-day and weekend delivery are available, and for some possibly earlier than originally expected. Users can log into their account on apple.com or through the Apple Store app to view their current order status. Earlier this week we noted that Apple had started charging credit cards for some MacBook Pro orders, signalling that the company will soon begin shipping the device to customers. As always, stay tuned for additional details as they become available. And if you get your paws on a new Touch Bar-equipped MacBook Pro in the coming days, please let us know what you make of it in the comments.

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady Rumor: AirPods may arrive come mid-November Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Friday, November 11th, 2016, 05:30 Category: AirPods, Hardware, Hardware, retail, Rumor Tweet Back in late October, Apple delayed the launch of its much-anticipated AirPods, the company stating that it needed “a little more time” before the units were ready for prime time. Since then, the headphones have been listed as “currently unavailable” on Apple’s web site. Previous rumors had the AirPods as arriving in January 2017, suggesting they will not be available in time for this year’s holiday shopping season. Perhaps more optimistically, an employee at Apple reseller Conrad has reportedly told a customer it will receive AirPods stock on November 17, and make them available to purchase by November 18-19. Here’s the quote as it stands: Hello, I have just talked with an employee of the Conrad Online Store, since I am there on 14.10 the AirPods ordered and I wanted to cancel today. According to information from the employee, they have stockpiles from 17.11, I will then have them between November 18-19. Conrad’s website has the AirPods as becoming available for delivery in 7 to 8 weeks, so this rumor could be correct, albeit there remains some doubt to contend with. It’s a rumor, take it or leave it, but it could portend the AirPods you’ve been hankering for being available that much sooner.

Now that it's an increasing norm, the Mate 9 finds itself the focus of greater attention than its predecessors - and for good reason. After all, the big phone market is in something of a spin: Samsung has crashed out with the Note 7, leaving Apple and Google to cruise along with the respective iPhone 7 Plus and Pixel XL phones. Both of which are just about as expensive as phones get, priced from £719 a piece. As long-time Mate fans - we used the Mate 8 for months - we had waited with baited breath to see what the Mate 9's play would be. But unlike its predecessors, it's not gone in with a low-blow price point to send the competition scuppering. Instead this €699 handset has nipped and tucked the screen into a 5.9-inch form (but stuck with just a 1080p resolution), ramped up its interior specification, and comes with a dual camera arrangement too. With the price gap shrinking between the big-screen options, however, and Huawei's latest EMUI 5.0 software rolling out with some overzealous app permissions handling, does it have the big features to stand apart from the competition? How big is the Mate 9 design? 5.9-inch 1920 x 1080 resolution display 156.9 x 78.9 x 7.9mm metal body, 190g Available in white or silver (black front) in UK At first glance the Mate 9 looks a whole lot like its Mate 8 predecessor from the front. The screen is 5.9-inches across diagonally (rather than the 6-inch of the Mate 8), which means the dimensions are the tiniest bit reduced - but only by a millimetre, so you really won't notice that in the hand. Huawei Mate 9 vs Huawei Mate 8: What's the difference? It's only really when flipping the phone over to reveal its new dual camera make-up that the biggest differences can be seen, though. The new twin cameras - one sensor 12MP colour, the other a 20MP Leica-sourced black and white - are stacked vertically in a single protruding, optically-stabilised unit (so are different to the existing P9 model), with flash and laser autofocus positioned alongside. So the Mate 9 is, in essence, a Mate 8S. Which is fine in one sense, because the full metal body with chamfered edges is well made. But in another sense it's not so fine, because Huawei did something very strange at the Mate 9's global launch: it showed off a special-edition Porsche Design model before its new champion. Which has a 5.5-inch screen, curved edges and, despite its huge €1,395 price tag, looks and feels a lot better than the Mate 9 (and a whole lot like the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge, too). Huawei Mate 9 vs Huawei Mate 9 Porsche Design: What's the difference? Perhaps the Porsche Design model will be the footing for the Mate's future - or even a different Huawei series. We just don't know. And, right now, we have to ignore that device because the larger pocket-poker Mate 9 is the phone that's been living in our hands and alongside our leg for a whole seven days. How does the Mate 9 perform? Kirin 960 chipset, octa-core (4x 2.4GHz, 4x1.8GHz) Mali G71 MP8 GPU, Vulkan API 4GB RAM, 64GB on-board storage (plus microSD) The Mate 9 does quick-strike with many points of merit. It's got 64GB on-board storage as standard. There's dual-SIM capability, or the second slot can be used for a microSD card to further expand that storage. It's got a great fingerprint scanner that's well positioned on the rear, too, and works as well as - if not better than - the near competition. And it's got up to Cat 12 4G capabilities meaning multiple bands for speedy wireless connectivity. Pocket-lint Now draw breath. But the biggest thing is the boost to its internal processing and graphical power. As the first device on the market to use the HiSilicon Kirin 960 chipset, with ARM-sourced cores, it's said to be 180 per cent more CPU capable than the earlier Mate 8. You wouldn't think it just looking at the numbers compared ot the 950, but the 960 is nippy. From our point of view, though, it's the latest Mali G71 graphics that really sets the Mate 9 apart from other Huawei phones. Frequently we've bemoaned how games might have the occasional stutter or take a bit too long to load. With this ramped-up GPU on board the Mate 9 hasn't had any such troubles when running titles. From Plants vs Zombies 2, to Candy Crush and beyond. And while those might not sound like the most tasking of gaming apps, plenty of devices will stutter animations between completed levels, or when graphics slide in across the whole screen. Not so the Mate 9. Pocket-lint Which beds the device down well to take-on some of its pricier competition. The one that Huawei really has in its sights is the iPhone 7 Plus. Technically the Mate 9's GPU isn't as proficient as Apple's (even Huawei said this on stage at the Kirin launch in Shanghai), but the company claims the way it interacts with memory and storage makes it faster in almost all cases. We'll hand it to the company: the Mate 9 feels good in use and is consistently quick. What is the Mate 9's software like? Android 7.0 with EMUI 5.0 skin App twin for dual WhatsApp / Messenger Knock Knock knuckle-based commands There's always the "oh, by the way" software point to be made with Huawei though. The Mate 9 comes with Android 7.0 Nougat from launch, with the company's EMUI 5.0 re-skin over the top. By and large it looks and feels like a normal Android operating system, but with some tweaks that serve in both positive and negative ways. Let's preface by saying that, despite the phone telling us it's running EMUI 5.0, that by public release this may be version 5.0.1 or something to fix some of the smaller issues that we've spotted. And there are enough of them, some of which are just scruffy: notifications show as an accumulative number to the top-left corner rather than icons, for example; the battery percentage and 24-hour clock indicators are in different fonts in the default theme. C'mon, details matter. With such a big screen, Huawei has also implemented a system to avoid accidental touches doing things you don't want, such as firing the shutter in camera, for example. We've still managed to shoot pics by accident though. When we've seen it most come into play is when one-handed holding the device and trying to type - the letter "p" tends to stick, not completing the ongoing word when using SwiftKey, for example. The sentiment makes sense, but in practice it's just a minor hindrance. Then there's so-called Knock Knock, which is Huawei's knuckle-based control mechanism to make, say, screen grabs and audio recordings, or write on-screen letters with your knuckle to quick-launch an app. At first sight, back in the (then-called Ascend) P7 era, this tech was terrible. It's come a long way and now, if you remember to use it, it's quite practical. You can switch it on or off if it's too much to manage too. On the positive side, EMUI 5.0 bakes in an App Twin feature that means typically device-locked applications - Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp for UK audiences - can be duplicated, one per SIM. So if you have a business account and a private account both can run simultaneously. It works well. And it's easy to switch off the second SIM if you don't want that part of your life/business active at a given time. There are some additional apps that will thrown themselves into the mix too: Huawei Health, which can track steps and fitness activities to help you achieve goals; HiCare which is a contact service with Huawei if you encounter device issues; HiGame, which, similar to Samsung's implementation, is a pointless secondary receptacle for gaming apps; and Todolist which, like the name says, is a to-do list. How long does the Mate 9's battery last? 4,000mAh battery USB-C charging Average 16-hours life per charge A trait of EMUI software is that it's really critical of battery life. And here's where the software, once again, goes a bit overboard. The app permissions are incredibly demanding by default, limiting all manner of alerts and notifications that you might want active. Pop-up high-level battery use notifications are also commonplace (which happen per application), with repeat dismisses not baking into the phone's memory that you might actually want to see this app each and every time. You can go into permissions manually and make adjustments for individual apps about what they can and can't do - from drawing over other apps, through to closing down when the lock screen is activated - so in that sense there's good granular control, but it's not particularly consumer friendly. Now, the earlier Mate 8's battery life was astoundingly good. The Mate 9 shares the same 4,000mAh cell, but, for a variety of reasons, we've not been getting quite as long a life from it. It'll easily serve a long day, though, we just wouldn't call it a two-dayer. On average, we've been returning around 16-hours of use, which is good going. Examples have differed, such as an office day when out and about - serving 13-hours of mixed use, with two long periods of screen off time. Over a weekend we saw around 21-hours of use from a single charge, with less work-related tasks easing off consumption. One point is that the latest EMUI 5.0 software is brighter, lighter, whiter. It might sound like a toothpaste ad, by ditching the complex colours and themes of earlier software to run with more bright whites, the screen is working harder more often. NFC also seems to be highly impactful on battery life. The new Kirin processor is likely to be more taxing too - it's certainly run hot from time to time. And, of course, dual SIM use will also have an impact - although we haven't used two SIM cards for the duration of this review at all, because we don't run two in everyday life. The Mate 9 isn't going to explode too, right? 4.5V 5A SuperCharge fast-charging Dynamic current adjustment based on source Fortunately fast-charging - which Huawei calls SuperCharge - is on board the Mate 9. By lowering the voltage (to around 4.5V) and upping the current (to 5A) the battery can be charged in double-quick time - some 50 per cent quicker than the Mate 8 - meaning just 30-minutes at the plug could see the Mate 9 have almost 60 per cent charge. Pocket-lint A potential problem here is safety given the increased voltage. We've all heard about Samsung Note 7 phones overheating and exploding into balls of fire. Huawei has put in a dynamic charging mechanism, meaning the Mate 9 can adapt to the source charger and cable used as required - so a shoddy third-party charger will make the phone dynamically lower the current (and slow down charging in the process, but that's fine). A five-gate protection system also checks different points throughout the phone to ensure it's not overheating. That's not to say the phone won't get hot, though, because it can. One of the potential issues with the SuperCharge system is that higher voltage recharging systems are more likely to run down the battery's longevity. Although Huawei denies this will be the case with the battery, it also confirmed the underlying source battery is the same as that in the last-generation Mate 8. Sounds like something is amiss here for all that to add up. But we won't know until after many months of use. Huawei Mate 9 review: What's this born to last stuff about? Intelligent algorithm to improve device longevity Prioritises your favourite apps, based on use One of Huawei's big claims about that Mate 9 is that it is born fast and will remain fast. We've only had the phone for a week, so how true that will be we can't really say. Pocket-lint But here's the background on what the company has done. The new Kirin chipset has been designed to function with a new intelligent algorithm to learn your usage over time and prioritise the importance of apps and avoid slowdown. Before launch Huawei was calling this a very Apple-sounding "iAware" - a name that, unsurprisingly, has vanished from the official product release. This technology is designed to get better over time for an improved life experience that doesn't slow down after a matter of months. Its trio of target areas - smart memory allocation, CPU allocation and storage optimisation - are the basis for its operation. The algorithm, which implements storage defragmentation, doesn't appear to exacerbate any of the pop-up notifications compared to earlier EMUI software. The only way to know for sure that it works is to fast-forward a year into the future or something. Why does the Mate 9 have two cameras? What can dual cameras do? Twin 27mm f/2.2 equivalent rear cameras 12MP colour and 20MP monochrome sensors Optical image stabilisation 4K video (H.265 compression) When Huawei launched the P9 smartphone its headline feature was a dual camera setup - one colour, one monochrome - with a Leica partnership. That relationship continues with the Mate 9, but the arrangement is slightly different. Pocket-lint The two sensors in the Mate 9 are different resolutions: the 12-megapixel full colour one is paired with a higher-resolution 20-megapixel monochrome module. Both peer through 27mm equivalent, f/2.2 aperture lenses, and both offer optical image stabilisation - hence the rear bump on the handset (which is kind of ironic, given how enthused Huawei CEO, Richard Yu, was when unveiling the "no bump" P9). The Leica-partnered software is slightly updated compared to the P9, with a pinch-to-zoom feature that can digitally zoom into the frame. This is Huawei wanting to chase down the Apple iPhone 7 Plus, but without utilising two different lens focal lengths we're not convinced it's a particularly giant leap forward compared to the P9. It does offer a quirky feature though: the 20MP black and white image details can even be utilised by the colour camera to enhance the overall detail in the frame to deliver 20MP colour images. They're still way bigger than you'll need from a phone, though. Pocket-lint Whether you care about a dedicated monochrome sensor or not will come down to your way of thinking. We think proper black and white is fun but not essential, really. We have got some good results out of it. The same can be said for the colour camera. Huawei wants to play with the big boys and this effort - while not the very best out there; the camera app is slower to load than the Google Pixel - is knocking on the door of the best flagships, for sure. Focus is snappy and image processing is well handled. Low-light images don't go overboard with image noise, which is great news, while auto high dynamic range works well. If you want full control - in either colour or mono options - then a swipe up will unveil all the settings you could want. Pocket-lint But while the main camera elements are all good, we find some of the dual camera abilities just gimmicky. The ability to apply a fake bokeh down to f/0.95 in post is often overbearing and just looks plain weird. We get that the cameras can map depth and offset these measurements for relatively convincing results - something Apple, HTC and others have played with (all unsuccessfully) - but it doesn't mean that you necessarily should. Use it subtly, for the right shot, and the fake depth-of-field effect can work. We're just not big fans. How we feel about Mate 9's the cameras largely reflects how we felt about the P9: we think the monochrome sensor is fun, but a rare feature of genuine use; the core camera is handled really well, with point-and-shoot, manual options and even 4K video capture all ticking the boxes; and the post-processing options can sometimes work against what this flagship does so well at a core level. Verdict What might come as a surprise about the Mate 9 is just how much it's like the Mate 8 - and we were expecting bigger changes. It's a big slice of phone and sticks with a not-flagship Full HD resolution screen (1920 x 1080), this time in a 5.9-inch panel. That's good enough, but the also-announced Porsche Design version of the Mate 9 overshadows its standard sibling. With a 5.5-inch screen size and Quad HD resolution (2160 x 1440) it's an entirely different and entirely distracting beauty. Like the Mate flagship we really wanted. Where the Mate 9 clearly differs from its Mate 8 predecessor is with its performance. The latest Kirin 960 processor and GPU runs applications smooth as butter. Battery performance from that 4,000mAh cell is strong for a guaranteed all-day experience and SuperCharge fast-charging is great. But that comes at the expense of the latest EMUI 5.0 software, which can being annoyingly persistent in its strict permissions, excess notifications and alt-Android ways. The Mate 9 also sees a price jump, which at €699 is now knocking on the door of its Apple and Google competitors. It undercuts them slightly, plus delivers headline features such as a decent dual camera. But with that price gap now closing, the Porsche Design model casting a shadow of sorts, and few points of distinction to really set the Mate 9 apart, Huawei is largely banking on Samsung's explosive exit from this market to succeed.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Why is Samsung Racing to launch their first Foldable Dumbphone? | Main | Samsung Reconsiders Foldable Smartphones as Fear of another Market Blunder Weighs Heavily on the Company » November 11, 2016 Apple Supplier Japan Display may get one last Government Bailout to help it Shift to OLED   In September Patently Apple posted a report titled "One of Apple's Top Display Suppliers is on the Ropes." We noted in the report that Japan Display was Apple's leading display supplier. When Apple notified all of the display suppliers that they were switching to OLED, it caught Japan Display off guard. They had committed to new LCD equipment to keep up with Apple's demands and now they were unable to secure new equipment and the Japanese government who was supporting them was was considering to divest because they were too dependent on Apple. A week later we reported on the rumor that Foxconn's Sharp wanted to tag-team with Japan Display in order to become a major Apple OLED supplier in quick order. With the situation becoming dire, the Japanese government is reconsidering a bailout for Japan Display.   It's being reported today by the Wall Street Journal that Japan Display Chief Executive Mitsuru Homma said Wednesday that the INCJ 'is considering financial support to help us grow,' again. INCJ is the Japanese government-backed fund known as 'Innovation Network Corp. of Japan (INCJ).'   Japan Display is projecting a small operating profit for their full fiscal year which ends in March due to Apple's iPhone 7 orders.   Japan Display wants to invest in OLED for the medium to long term while continuing to improve their LCD technology in the hopes of being able to compete against OLED in different markets.     About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

One customer who spoke to an employee at Conrad – an Apple reseller in Germany –  was told the headphones will be ready to launch next Friday, November 18. The source told German site Apfelpage.de, “I have just talked with an employee of the Conrad Online Store, since I am there on 14.10 the AirPods ordered and I wanted to cancel today [sic]. “According to information from the employee, they have stockpiles from 17.11, I will then have them between November 18-19.” Not long now We’ve asked Apple to confirm the release of the AirPods, but the company declined to comment. There’s no guarantee the customer or the supplier is right, but it would make sense as it would be three weeks after the original delay, and a Friday – Apple regularly releases its products on a Friday, so that detail would check out. The reason for the delay isn't currently clear, but Apple did state when the AirPods launched it would only release the headphones when ready for public use.

But the unprecedented win of Republican candidate Donald Trump after such a tumultuous campaign has now prompted Cook to address his employees and the entire company in an effort to unite the people. How To Conduct Business After 2016 U.S. Elections Cook wrote in an email to employees in U.S. and addressed how Apple will conduct business after the result of the 2016 U.S. Presidential Elections has surfaced. In his staff-wide letter, he quoted Dr. Marthin Luther King, Jr. as he expressed empathy for workers who have been crestfallen by the outcome of the Presidential Race recently. He wrote that the company has a very diverse group of workers including supporters of the candidates on both parties. "Regardless of which candidate each of us supported as individuals, the only way to move forward is to move forward together," he said. There is no denying the fact that the 2016 U.S. Presidential Race and campaign period was ridden with conflict, so Tim Cook went on to shed light on to his employees that Apple is a profit-seeking company, which must continue trade as usual. "I recall something Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said 50 years ago: 'If you can't fly, then run. If you can't run, then walk. If you can't walk, then crawl, but whatever you do you have to keep moving forward,'" he added. Apple And Donald Trump Apple's relationship with Donald Trump has been a frigid one, so far. Trump even publicly called to boycott Apple products because of the company's refusal to develop a GovOS version atop iOS to assist the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) following its denial to crack open an iPhone owned by a terrorist responsible for the San Bernardino attack earlier this year due to breaking its security protocols. In line with Trump's public criticism, Apple responded that it put the company in the hands of other good people. More so, Apple decided to hold back its usual technological and financial support for the GOP convention when it selected Trump as its party candidate. The one thing both public figures have in common, in spite of this, is that they both want to reform tax and make it cheaper for companies to repatriate their overseas earnings. Cook has repetitively called for this move and Donald Trump has actually promised to decrease tax on repatriated revenue to 10 percent from 35 percent.

Posted By: Arash FekriPosted date: November 12, 2016In: Technology Page 1 of 212» According to the latest reports, an iOS 10 jailbreak tool is currently working on iPod, iPad, and iPhones. It comes with great features and benefits but the tool doesn’t come from Pangu, it originates from the Unblock-Jailbreak team. People are asking whether this means the end for Pangu and TaiG. The release of the Apple iOS 10 jailbreak means that it comes with many different benefits besides the standard ones. Users can now gain access to Cydia. The benefits will help the users gain access to updates for alifetime, utilize SIM cards from various network providers and also money-back guarantees. Furthermore, it has been assured by the Unblock-Jailbreak team that their newly launched jailbreak tool will not damage the current functions and features of any Apple devices. However, besides the security and safety claims from the team, users are advised to exercise caution before downloading this particular jailbreak tool. Firstly, you must always back up your iPod, iPhone or iPad device before trying to jailbreak your device. The silence from other jailbreak teams like Pangu and TaiG indicates that these hackers have finally surrendered to the stringent security measures of the new iOS 10. Geeky Gadgets reported that the company had released the iOS10.0.2 software update which comes with various performance improvements and bug fixes. Moreover, the new system update will bolster the stability of iOSdevices. The latest move from Apple has left Pangu and TaiG clueless, regarding their next move. Meanwhile, reports from other sources indicate that Pangu has managed to jailbreak IOS 10. Sadly, full information about it is still unavailable. It is possible that Pangu is playing the waiting game with developers from Apple and the jailbreak tool for iOS 10 should be releasedby December. Apple decided to release iOS10.1 just weeks after the release of iOS10. Although it seems like a peculiar move from Apple, this greatly limits the jailbreakers from coming up with another tool within such a short period. As a result, the Chinese team of developers has remained completely silent. As a result, most Apple fans believe that Pangu is playing a waiting game with the iOSdevelopers at the moment. Meanwhile, it is believed that Apple is waiting to release another update titled, iOS10.1.1 to address several issues faced in iOS10 due to the deletion of Apple Health Data along with vulnerability issues faced on 10.1. It is expected that the beta version will arrive anytime soon. Therefore, Apple fans believe that the jailbreak tool should arrive before the holiday season ends. As for a jailbreaker, the first thing that they should do is stay put with iOS10. According to iPhone Hacks, if the user upgrades to 10, he will not be able to downgrade the device to earlier versions if he wants to jailbreak. This is because Apple has stopped providing SHSH blobs for the firmware. The second step that he needs to focus on is use the TinyUmbrella tool to save all the SHSH blobs for downgrading in the future. iPhone Hacks reported that TinyUmbrella is compatible with various iOSversions like iOS 9.3.4 and lower. Since there is no information from Pangu and TaiG, it seems that they may take time developing the tool so as to break all the restrictions imposed by the new iOS. Recently, Apple announced a new application for their Apple TV, and this could entirely change the way in which we stream and view content.

China’s Tech Giants Are Cloning the Apple Store Bloomberg 4 days ago Christina Larson < PREVIOUS SLIDE SLIDE 1 of 3 NEXT SLIDE > The SZ DJI Technology Co. store stands in Shenzhen, China, on Friday, Dec. 18, 2015. © Bloomberg In September, Chinese drone maker DJI opened a flagship store in Hong Kong’s trendy Causeway Bay neighborhood. On the first floor, in an area cordoned off with black netting, like a batting cage, customers test the machines in flight. The second floor resembles a museum, the walls decorated with framed aerial drone photos of a bamboo forest in Kyoto, Japan; white waves trailing a ship near the Philippines; farm equipment combing fields in the Netherlands. The third floor houses a repair station, where on a recent Wednesday afternoon, three people stood in line waiting for advice. Selling in its own stores in China is new for 10-year-old DJI. While the Shenzhen company is the world’s leading seller of consumer drones, it is, unlike most Chinese tech businesses, more popular elsewhere. About 80 percent of sales come from abroad, more than half from the U.S., where hobbyist interest had been cultivated by decades’ worth of radio-controlled helicopters and other toys. The U.S. also taught DJI the value of brick and mortar, says Michael Perry, DJI’s director for strategic partnerships. A deal with Apple put the company’s new Phantom 4 drone in more than 400 Apple Stores around the world this spring, and the resulting bump in sales led DJI to think harder about expanding its in-store presence. In the past year the drone maker has opened stores in Shenzhen, Beijing, and Seoul, along with the one in Hong Kong. “It’s really important to have a place where consumers can see a drone, where they can fly it for the first time,” says Perry. “We want customers to be able to see, touch, and ask questions.” DJI isn’t alone. In the world’s largest e-commerce market, leading technology companies are paying renewed attention to physical retail. Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma surprised shareholders when he wrote in an Oct. 13 letter, “Pure e-commerce players will soon face tremendous challenges.” Now that China’s decade-plus of double-digit growth in internet users has flattened, “in the coming years, we anticipate the birth of a reimagined retail industry, driven by the integration of online, offline, logistics and data,” Ma wrote. Alibaba Chief Executive Officer Daniel Zhang said on a Nov. 2 earnings call that the biggest opportunity in e-commerce is working together with retail operations. “Online and offline will be a single seamless experience, not just in consumer interaction, but also in the entire business operation,” said Zhang. Last year, Alibaba paid $4.6 billion for a 20 percent stake in electronics retail chain Suning. Among the potential symbioses, shoppers could use the chain’s 1,600 or so Chinese stores as showrooms, testing merchandise there before deciding whether to comparison shop online. In October the two companies announced plans to invest 1 billion yuan ($148 million) to set up an e-commerce venture designed to manage Suning stores’ presence on Alibaba sites and strengthen the chain’s customer service, among other things. Other Chinese tech brands are investing directly in shopping options modeled loosely on Apple’s retail efforts, stores in which customers can test devices and ask questions of sales staff. The shift is most clearly on display in the smartphone business, where online purchases peaked last fall and manufacturers are looking to diversify retail options, says CK Lu, a China market analyst at researcher Gartner. In the second half of last year, about 30 percent of smartphones bought in China were ordered online; in the first six months of 2016 the figure dipped to a little more than 20 percent, Lu says. Huawei, the No. 3 phone maker in the world behind Samsung and Apple, operates 515 stores across China and has teamed with retail chains. Five years ago its smartphone business barely existed. Colin Giles, executive vice president for Huawei’s consumer-business division, says its brick-and-mortar presence proved to be a big help. “You can’t ignore it,” he says. “Chinese consumers for sure are looking for a premium shopping experience.” Xiaomi, which made its name with online flash sales of its low-cost smartphones, is now looking to retail to boost its brand image and entice Chinese shoppers to splurge on its internet-connected appliances. The company operates 36 Mi Home stores in China, displaying its latest curved-screen smartphones alongside branded smart rice cookers, hoverboards, robot vacuum cleaners, and other electronics. Xiaomi says it will open 1,000 more stores in China in the next five years. “Physical stores are getting more and more important, because they offer a chance to show the value of the product,” says Jessie Ding, an analyst at researcher Canalys. She says Xiaomi’s weakness offline allowed domestic competitors to overtake it. Like Ding, Shaun Rein, managing director of China Market Research Group, says the maturing of China’s electronics market, and its electronics shoppers, places a heavier burden on companies to distinguish themselves. “It’s an absolute necessity as Chinese consumers develop more refined tastes and are willing to spend a bit more,” Rein says. “They want that personal retail experience. And if they spend more money, they care more about follow-up service.” Huawei’s Giles says his team is using customer surveys and follow-ups to learn as much as possible about what shoppers want more of, both online and off. He, too, recognizes that it’s tougher to stand out in China’s tech market than it used to be. Go to one of China’s big e-commerce sites, like Taobao or JD.com, and “there are probably over 1,000 handsets, all marketed in-site in the same way,” says Giles. “You need to have a brand to cut through.” The bottom line: Several of China’s e-commerce and mobile stars are spending heavily on retail stores to distinguish their customer service.

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Apple iPhone 8 may feature truly wireless charging technology Apple iPhone 8 may feature truly wireless charging technology By Bindu Nair - Nov 11, 2016 An intriguing new report attempts to shed some light on the wireless charging technology which the iPhone 8 may adopt when it comes out next year. Unlike standard wire-free docks or pads, Apple may be developing a truly cordless solution. Previous rumors have held that Apple is working with a company called Energous to implement wireless charging in its future iPhones. The latter’s technology requires a chip to be installed inside a device. This chip can connect to a base station located up to 15 feet away. The transmitter would be plugged into an outlet and power up the device without any physical contact. The system appears to be unlike any other charging solution available in the market right now. It would also handily resolve an iPhone 7 owner’s current dilemma of not being able to charge and listen to music at the same time. As for evidence of this happening, BGR reports that Energous recently stated that it is working with a ‘tier 1’ smartphone manufacturer. Also See- iPhone 8 : All you need to know about it This in itself is too vague to directly assume that the manufacturer is indeed Apple. However, further proof arrives with the fact that Dialog Semiconductor and Pegatron, both major Apple production partners, have invested huge sums into Energous. The former is notably a power management solutions company which has sunk in $10 million as a strategic investment. If not Apple, the other possible tier 1 firm being bandied about is Samsung. This seems very unlikely as of now, though only time will tell whether this assumption is accurate or not.

(Reuters/Robert Galbraith) Share Written by Aimee Groth & Alison Griswold Obsession 2016 November 11, 2016 Silicon Valley is slowly conceding the fact that Donald Trump is the next president of the United States. Aside from one divisive and vocal supporter, its leaders threw their support behind Hillary Clinton, who ran a tech-friendly platform. For eight years, the Valley enjoyed the privilege of Barack Obama’s fascination with their industry—the president enthusiastically hosted science fairs and demo days at the White House, toured innovation factories and tested technology on the cutting edge of AI development, and mused on topics like Universal Basic Income with journalists—which translated into support for policies favored by the industry (around Net Neutrality, patent reform, and immigration, for example). How Trump will engage with Silicon Valley and approach technological innovation more broadly are wild cards. His comments around immigration and putting up a wall along the US border are troubling to tech leaders, who heavily rely on drawing engineering talent from abroad. Many startup founders have remained silent on what a Trump presidency means for their companies, but some executives took the opportunity to rally their teams. The morning after the election, Zuckerberg posted a photo of himself watching the results with his daughter, and shared that there’s “work ahead of us to create the world we want for our children.” Apple CEO Tim Cook emailed employees and reminded them that “Apple’s North Star hasn’t changed.” Facebook and Apple are positioned to weather any sort of storm, of course. Many young founders see the election as a test of their own leadership skills. A few of them shared with Quartz memos that they sent to their teams after election night and weighed in on what a Trump presidency could mean for the industry. * * * Miki Agrawal, a founder of several ventures including THINX, a startup that developed high-tech underwear for women, emailed her 35-person, all-millennial staff, on Wednesday (Nov. 9): Team, Yesterday’s outcome was a wake-up call. As individuals and as a team, we must put our heads together to strive to do even more to raise consciousness, educate people and most importantly, spread love. The angrier we are, the more the wrong people win. Let us come together at 12:30pm today and please, each of you, bring thoughtful answers to the following questions: 1) How do I plan on showing up personally in the next year to come? 2) How can we as a company be agents for positive change during these upcoming tougher times for our greater communities? 3) What can we do differently the remainder of this year (adjust our strategy) with the holidays coming to inspire the people who love our brand and us in a positive way? I am so proud of the people behind this company who care so deeply about issues that bring about equality, so may we now roll up our sleeves even more to create the change we authentically want to see ourselves. We got this ok? We have 3 babies entering the world, we need to plant healthy roots for them! XO M Agrawal’s twin sister Radha Agrawal is a producer for Daybreaker, a community that throws early-morning dance parties popular among startup founders in New York City and San Francisco. On Wednesday morning Daybreaker threw parties that attracted hundreds of entrepreneurs (many of whom campaigned hard for Hillary Clinton) in both cities, followed by a discussion session about how to mobilize their teams after the election. At DoorDash, a food delivery startup headquartered in San Francisco, general counsel Keith Yandell sent a note acknowledging the “surprise, uncertainty, and confusion” expressed by employees in the wake of the election. “I promise to you that DoorDash remains committed to fostering an inclusive and diverse culture that is accepting of everyone,” he wrote. “We can move forward by executing and living out the values upon which the company was founded: that we stand for anyone that is trying to make it.” Marco Zappacosta, CEO of jobs and home services listing site Thumbtack, wrote in a note to employees that Thumbtack would “continue to be committed to creating an inclusive company where all people are empowered to reach their potential.” But, he continued, “we can all make an impact outside our walls”: Political scientists will study this election for a long time to come, but there is no doubt that yesterday’s outcome highlighted that there are many people across the political spectrum who feel like the hopes and dreams they hold most dear are slipping out of reach. Now, we’re not going to solve that problem, but we can do our part to help. The Thumbtack we’re building should let anyone with the talent, time, and hustle move closer to fulfilling their dreams and creating a better life for themselves. While we’re proud to say that we’ve already enabled tens of thousands of small business owners from all walks of life to do this, we know there’s still plenty of room to grow. To be clear, getting to where we want to be as a platform doesn’t mean hitting some arbitrary revenue or GMV number. It means truly becoming a pathway to a middle class career that everyone can access. Other entrepreneurs were similarly optimistic. Startup founders engage with high uncertainty every day; it’s the nature of their jobs. Many are now choosing to see the reality of Trump presidency as a new opportunity. Meanwhile, venture capitalists are saying that for the time being, it’s business as usual. “From chaos comes opportunity,” said Jake Bronstein, who founded Flint and Tinder, a fashion tech startup acquired by Huckberry in February. Like most of his peers, Bronstein voted for Clinton. “From uncertainty comes even more opportunity.” Alex Abelin, a former Google public affairs manager who co-founded Liquid Talent, a platform for gig economy workers (which has paused operations), was also a strong Clinton supporter but is trying to keep an open mind about Trump. “In some weird analogy, Trump is sort of like a startup founder,” Abelin said. “He was never an elected official. He has no real business being CEO of our country. But he has a founder’s mentality, which is that by passion, by vision—though I don’t see his vision—he has this belief that you can start something from nothing.” Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

More Evidence Shows iPhone 8 Could Feature Revolutionary Wireless Charging GO Apple working to offer wireless charging on next iPhone Nov 11, 2016 10:58 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  If you’re a long-time iPhone user, you’re probably OK with the charging system that Apple is offering on its flagship product, but if you come from a Samsung, you certainly miss the wireless and fast charging systems that come in super handy on a daily basis. And while at first glance it might seem like Apple is lagging behind rivals here, Cupertino actually has a plan of offering wireless charging on the next iPhone, but not in a way you’re already used to. In the last few months, we’ve seen several hints that Apple might be working on a wireless charging system that would allow the iPhone to charge without a charging plate, as is the case with the existing implementations, but using transmitters that can be plugged in anywhere in a room. The main idea here is that you could be able to charge the iPhone whenever the device is in close range to the transmitter, and it appears that this is exactly what Apple is aiming for right now. Investments for possible partnership According to a report from BGR, Energous, which is the company that Apple has been rumored to be working with on wireless charging systems, has received a $10 million investment from Dialog Semiconductor, another firm that’s currently working closely with Apple. Cupertino is the number one customer of Dialog, whose main activity is the production of power management solutions for a wide variety of consumer electronics, including phones. Energous previously revealed that it was working with what it called a “tier 1” smartphone manufacturer, projecting increased revenues in the coming quarters. Apple is believed to be this manufacturer, although no confirmation has been provided so far. All signs, however, seem to be pointing that Apple and Energous are working on something very innovative for next year. If this is indeed happening, the new iPhone could launch with wireless charging systems built by Energous and allowing the device to charge from distances of 15 feet (4 meters) from a transmitter plugged into a wall socket across the room. This is possible with a small chip placed on the iPhone’s motherboard which would enable wireless charging. Without a doubt, Apple’s new system will be locked, so although it would be virtually possible to charge other electronics using this system, Cupertino will restrict the feature to iPhones exclusively. #Apple#iPhone#iPhone 8#wireless charging subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Father Says iPhone Nearly Caught Fire in His Daughter’s Pocket Trump Edition Gold-Plated iPhone 7 Up for Grabs for $3,000 iPhone 7 Plus Reportedly Explodes After Accidental Drop iPhones Get a Feature to Secretly Call the Police Without Anyone Noticing Apple Insider Says iPhone 6 Plus Has a Major Bug, Company Should Start Recall Hackers Steal FIFA Currency, Buy Houses and Expensive Cars with the Money WhatsApp Announces Video Calling Rolling Out to Android, iOS Users Microsoft Announces Black Friday 2016 Deals: Perfect Time to Go Windows 10 KDE Frameworks 5.28.0 Released with Numerous KWayland Improvements, More NVIDIA Makes Available GeForce Graphics Driver 375.86 - Get It Now Microsoft CEO Meets Chinese Official One Day After Warning on Trump Tax Plan Apple Downplays Microsoft Surface, Says Having Touch on a Desktop Is a Disaster    iPhones could soon get wireless charging as well new ios apps NeuroNation: Train your brain to improve your memory and focus with NeuroNation Flipagram: Create cool videos by mixing up your photos with music Timer+: Set up dozens of timers and control them all with ease Nutshell Camera: Create some pretty cool videos with Nutshell Camera IKEA Catalogue: Check out the IKEA Catalogue for more than just furniture Complete: Complete puts a social twist to your regular to-do list/ task manager WebMD Baby: WebMD Baby offers help in how to best tend to your baby Reader comments Apple Insider Says iPhone 6 Plus Has a Major Bug, Company Should Start Recall more on: Apple i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

Reuters/Stephen Lam If reports are to be believed, Apple could be introducing a 15-inch variant for the MacBook Air line. In October, when the Cupertino-based tech giant did not mention the MacBook Air 2017, many tech experts felt that the company may be ending the series. However, many suggested that Apple would do so only after releasing another product, the last of its line. While it is impossible to understand what Apple is actually thinking, rumours suggest that the company will be releasing the Apple MacBook Air in 2017 that will be more compact and even thinner than its predecessor. Recent reports stated that a highly-advanced E-Ink keyboard may also be introduced along with the device. Sonder Design is a well-known manufacturer of these keyboards and Apple has reportedly got into a contract with the company to manufacture the keyboards for Apple. Many believe that the Apple MacBook Air 2017 will get an E-Ink keyboard made by Sonder Design, reported Macworld. There are also reports that the Apple MacBook Air 2017 will drop the USB-A ports in favour of the highly-advanced USB Type-C ports, reports MacRumors. Not much is known about the type of processor the device will be incorporated with. Even if Apple does not use the Kaby Lake processors to keep the price under check, it can go with the Skylake chipsets. Fans want Touch ID support, fingerprint sensor and Apple Pencil-enabled Trackpads in the Apple MacBook Air 2017. The new range of Apple products could also be having the virtual personal assistant Siri. All eyes are on March 2017 when Apple fans would expect a MacBook Air 2017 reveal. The future of the MacBook Air line is uncertain and it is high time for the tech behemoth to reveal some information on the product.

Unfortunately, last month Apple announced it’s giving its 11-inch ultraportable the ax. Moreover, by not upgrading the 13-inch MacBook Air ($999), it’s sentencing all of its sub $1,000 laptops to a slow death. That means that in the near future Apple could make the 12-inch MacBook ($1,299) and the 13-inch MacBook Pro ($1,499) the company’s new entry-level machines, sans entry level prices. Fortunately, the Apple Store offers refurbished MacBook Air, MacBook, and MacBook Pro laptops with prices starting at $929. If the idea of a refurbished laptop makes you hesitate, rest assured that Apple’s refurbs are among the best in the industry and they’re all backed by the same 1-year warranty found in Apple’s newer devices. Below we’ve rounded up a few refurb Apple laptops currently available. MacBook laptops on sale from $170 to $210 off: 11.6-inch MacBook Air for $929 ($170 off): There’s no Retina display and its 11-inch screen may be too small for some users, but at $929 — the 11-inch MacBook Air is the cheapest way to set foot inside the Mac laptop ecosystem. This laptop’s classic design has spawned countless imitators — including Apple’s own 12-inch MacBook — and its just 0.3 pounds heavier than the 2-pound 12-inch MacBook. This model has been upgraded to include 256GB of storage space. 12-inch MacBook for $1,182 ($210 off): The 12-inch MacBook is Apple’s most forward-thinking device to date. It defines the bleeding edge in PC portability and just like the original MacBook Air inspired dozens of competitors, so will the 12-inch MacBook. At its full price, however, it offers too little for too much money. As a refurb, it presents a more compelling argument, just keep in mind it doesn’t offer the best battery (that would be the 13-inch MacBook Air) nor does it offer the most horsepower, if CPU muscle is what you require. 13.3-inch MacBook Pro Retina for $1,099 ($200 off): This laptop costs $100 more than the entry-level 13-inch MacBook Air, yet it includes an eye-opening 2,560 x 1,600 pixel Retina Display. This 2015 model may be outdated — when compared to the just-released 13.3-inch MacBook Pro — but in terms of power it leaves the older 13-inch MacBook Air and 12-inch MacBook in the dust.

Press the Ctrl key, and then click your mouse. This is usually the default method of right-clicking with an Apple mouse. The Control key, when held down, switches the mouse to right-click mode. We know that this sounds a little weird, but some people actually prefer this approach. Try using this option for a little while and see what you think. If you can get used to it, great! If you’re still making a yucky face, let’s talk about option two. You can customize your mouse to respond a certain way to match your past habits. Start by heading over to System Preferences in the menu bar, and then select Mouse. For the average Apple mouse, this should open up a window with two tabs. Make sure you are in the Point & Click tab, and look for an option that says Secondary Click. This option should be check-marked. There is a dropdown immediately below this selection that allows you to set the secondary click to the right or left side of the mouse. You probably want to choose the right side—Apple has little videos that show you what the current effects are if this gets confusing. Then exit out and experiment with your mouse! Unfortunately, there’s no option to directly control the sensitivity of these right/left clicks. We suggest you experiment a little and see if the Apple mouse is working for you or if you need to consider a replacement. After all, you don’t have to use any particular mouse.

Reuters/Stephen Lam Since the Apple iPad Air 2 was released on Oct. 22, 2014, there hasn’t been much refreshes on the product. iPad fans have been eagerly waiting for the Cupertino tech giant to reveal some details and specs about the successor, Apple iPad Air 3. Up to now, rumours about the iPad Air 3 have regularly surfaced online and fans have no other choice but to rely on these rumours. According to Tech Times, the Apple iPad Air 3 is expected to sport a 9.7-inch 4K display and will reportedly host the latest A10 processor from Apple. It will also be sleeker than its predecessor. There is a possibility that the device will have a dual-camera setup. The primary camera could be of 8MP whereas the front-facing camera of 2.1MP. The primary camera may support LED flash. A bigger and better battery, a highly-improved display and a 4GB RAM are also expected in the device. A much sharper resolution than the iPad Air 2 is anticipated in Apple iPad Air 3. Some of the features that the device may come with include 3D Touch, fingerprint sensor, waterproof technology and four speakers. Apple will stick to its decision of not including the 3.5mm headphone jack in the device. With the Apple iPad Air 3, Apple may introduce two new colour variants, namely, Rose Gold and Jet Black. There is no concrete information on the Apple iPad Air 3 release date. While some believe the device will be releases in March 2017, other say Apple may choose to end the Air line altogether, writes ValueWalk. It is not known whether the iPad Air 3 will come with Apple Pencil support. Even if the device does support Apple Pencil, it won’t come free with the device. For now, users will have to wait till the first quarter of 2017 to fully understand if there will be an Apple iPad Air 3.

Image: Asif Islam/Shutterstock In the face of a $7.4bn fine, internet giant Google has dismissed the European Commission’s claims that its dominance of the mobile OS market is hurting competition. Google has responded to objections raised by the European Commission (EC) over how it manages Android compatibility and distributes apps. Google said that the Android ecosystem carefully balances the interests of developers, hardware makers and mobile network operators. “Android hasn’t hurt competition, it’s expanded it,” said Google senior vice president and general counsel, Kent Walker. ‘The rapid innovation, wide choice, and falling prices we see in smartphones represent the hallmarks of robust competition’ – KENT WALKER Google launched Android in 2007 as a free, open source operating system. Walker said that because manufacturers don’t have to buy or build expensive operating systems, some Android smartphones can be bought for as little as $45. As a result, globally, Android smartphones represent 87.5pc of all smartphones, compared with 12.1pc of phones that are iOS, according to figures from Strategy Analytics. “Today, more than 24,000 devices from over 1,300 brands run on Android. And European developers are able to distribute their apps to over a billion people around the world. Android is not a ‘one way street’; it’s a multi-lane highway of choice,” Walker said. All is fair in love and competition, says Google Walker said that the EC’s claim that Android and iOS don’t compete is simply not true. “We don’t see it that way. We don’t think Apple does either. Or phone makers. Or developers. Or users. In fact, 89pc of respondents to the Commission’s own market survey confirmed that Android and Apple compete. To ignore competition with Apple is to miss the defining feature of today’s competitive smartphone landscape. “Second, we are concerned that the Commission’s preliminary findings underestimate the importance of developers and the dangers of fragmentation in a mobile ecosystem. “Developers – and there were at least 1.3m of them in Europe in 2015 – depend on a stable and consistent framework to do their work. Any phone maker can download Android and modify it in any way they choose. But that flexibility makes Android vulnerable to fragmentation – a problem that plagued previous operating systems like Unix and Symbian. “When anyone can modify your code, how do you ensure there’s a common, consistent version of the operating system, so that developers don’t have to go through the hassle and expense of building multiple versions of their apps?” He said Google manages this challenge to make sure there is a minimal level of compatibility among Android devices. “Critically, we give phone makers wide latitude to build devices that go above that baseline, which is why you see such a varied universe of Android devices. That’s the key: our voluntary compatibility agreements enable variety, while giving developers confidence to create apps that run seamlessly across thousands of different phones and tablets. “This balance stimulates competition between Android devices as well as between Android and Apple’s iPhone,” Walker said. Pre-installed apps on Android Walker also hit out at the EC’s claims that Google shouldn’t pre-install Google apps such as Mail or Maps as part of a suite. Walker said that Android’s competitors offer less choice in the apps that come with their phones. He pointed out that, for example, on the Galaxy S7 from Samsung with Android 6.0, 11 out of 38 pre-installed apps are from Google; on the iPhone 7 with iOS 10, some 39 out of 39 pre-installed apps are from Apple; and on the Nokia Lumia 550 with Windows 10, 39 out of 47 pre-installed apps are from Microsoft. “On Android, Google’s apps typically account for less than one-third of the preloaded apps on the device, (and only a small fraction of device memory). A consumer can swipe away any of our apps at any time. And, uniquely, hardware makers and carriers can pre-install rival apps right next to ours. In competition-speak, that means there’s no ‘foreclosure’.” Walker also defended the distribution of Google Search and Play which enables it to offer the suite for free, rather than charge licence fees. “This free distribution is an efficient solution for everyone – it lowers prices for phone makers and consumers, while still letting us sustain our substantial investment in Android and Play. “Today’s mobile devices show all the signs of fierce competition with a wide range of business models: from vertically integrated ones like Apple’s iOS, to open-source systems like Android. The rapid innovation, wide choice, and falling prices we see in smartphones represent the hallmarks of robust competition,” Walker said. Google campus at Mountain View, California.

Rohit KVN   November 11, 2016 14:37 IST 1 Shares 1 Shares [Representational Image] Apple iPhone 8 massive leak: iPhone 7 successor tipped to come with game changing battery feature In Picture: Apple iPhone 7Reuters With the new Apple iPhone 7 series reaching to all corners of the world, now the media's attention has shifted to its successor iPhone 8. As 2017 marks the 10th anniversary of the iPhone launch, Apple is leaving no stone unturned to make the iPhone 8 series epic. This might sound a bit little exaggerated, but going by the recent spate of leaks with regard to the iPhone 8, we come to believe it will definitely give a stiff challenge to rivals for sure.

What's so special about this? readers may ask, as this is already seen in many smartphones for more than two years now. Well, Energous technology allows a phone or any device to get charged wirelessly from across a room, BGR reported. Energous charger chip will make any device literally draw power wirelessly It is believed that Apple intends to incorporate Energous-developed chip on the back of the iPhone 8 to enable wireless charging with up to 15 feet from the charging station. With this, iPhone 8 user will never have to leave the device attached to a power point in the home or office. They can carry it around or sit in a different room while it is continuously getting charged. If this revolutionary wireless charging feature in the iPhone 8 does turn out to be true, Apple will set a new benchmark in the smartphone industry, as it did with the first generation iPhone. As of now, neither Apple nor Energous has made any official comments on this report. That said, Energous in its recent earnings call had mentioned that it is working with a 'tier 1' smartphone company, which many believe it to be Apple. Furthermore, it received $10 million in funds from Dialog Semiconductor, which is also one of the top supply partners for Apple components. Other expected features of iPhone 8 series: From what we have gathered so far, Apple iPhone 8 series is expected to come in three screen sizes — 4.7-inch, 5.0-inch, and 5.5-inch. Except to the display size, all the models will have the same internal hardware and come with A11 Fusion series chipset, which is said be more efficient and powerful, as compared to the iPhone 7 series. Another interesting rumour on iPhone 8 series suggests that it will come with Organic Light Emitting Diode (OLED)-based display, a huge improvement over the Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) screen used in the current iPhone 7 series and older devices. And, 3D touch sensor is expected to be integrated right into the OLED screen. Apple's iPhone 8 series is expected to debut in September 2017. Watch this space for more updates.

Updated November 8, 2016 9:48AM SHARE ALSO SEE Apple MacBook Pro Cupertino MacBook Air Laptops Enterprise Hardware USB Apple Watch Apple TV Apple is looking more and more like it's lost its way. Revenue and earnings are falling. Sales of all its major products are in decline. Numerous individual products are getting long in the tooth, waiting years for updates. Even for products that are getting refreshed, the updates are underwhelming. Some of this might be understandable if the company were focusing on new products that will likely pay off big in the future. But the last new product the company launched -- Apple Watch -- looks increasingly like a dud. Apple's long-baking TV project has amounted to nothing; the company's never released either an Apple-branded television or TV service. And, with every new report that comes out, the company's "Titan" car project looks more and more like an expensive debacle. Apple established itself as the premium brand, the one everyone envied, with an enthusiastic customer base. Under Steve Jobs, it made a concerted effort to reach out to new customers with lower priced products such as the iPod shuffle or the Mac Mini. Those worked the same way that an entry-level Mercedes does -- they get people in the door and attached to the brand. Now it seems to have lost touch, and others are passing it by. Windows laptop makers like Razer recently have been releasing the kind of high-powered but elegantly designed machines that we used to expect from Apple. Microsoft just showed off an innovative touchscreen all-in-one desktop computer that's clearly targeted at the kind of creative professionals who have been loyal to Apple for years. And Google, Roku and Amazon are offering digital streaming devices that not only cost less than Apple TV, they support new standards like 4K and high-dynamic range video that it doesn't. During a conference call with financial analysts last month after Apple reported its latest quarterly results, CEO Tim Cook bristled at some pointed questions from Steve Milunovich, an analyst with UBS, about the company's strategy and direction. "We have the strongest pipeline that we've ever had and we're really confident about the things in it, but as usual, we're not going to talk about what's in it," Cook said. When pressed by Milunovich about whether the company had a "strong sense" of how the technology market was changing and how quickly it could respond to those changes, Cook answered curtly: "We have a strong sense of where things go, and we're very agile to shift as we need to." Despite Cook's assertions, Apple, the company that always seemed to know what consumers would want before they knew it themselves, is now making products that may seem cool in Cupertino but don't offer what customers want and are priced beyond what most can afford. "Apple no longer makes anything I care to buy," Seth Lewin, a self-described longtime Apple customer, posted in a comment on a tech blog. "Apple could care less what its customers think or say or want, it seems." We got a glimpse of this last year when Apple rolled out the new Macbook, a laptop that's both costly, at least for its target audience of consumers, and crippled. The $1,300 computer comes with an uncomfortably thin keyboard that's painful to type on and only one port that you can use to plug in things like external drives. You'll almost certainly have to buy some adapters for the computer, because that one port is so new that almost no devices support it yet. Oh, and if the computer's running out of power, you could be in a fix; you have to plug in its charger to the same port. We got another glimpse of Apple's cluelessness more recently when it unveiled the new iPhone, a device that was difficult to distinguish from last year's model, yet still priced the same. One of the few clear differences: Apple in the new model removed the headphone jack, a decision basically no one was calling for. It's a move that ticked off many users, worried others -- and promised to make many folks' lives more difficult by making it that harder to connect the iPhone to older audio equipment. But the company's recent press event may be the best indication of how out of touch it is these days. In the past, Apple has used such events to refresh its Mac lineup, roll out new iPads or update its Apple TV streaming device. With many of its products in those categories a year or more old -- and sales falling in nearly all of them, as best we can tell -- you might have thought Apple would have updated several at least, particularly its lower-priced, consumer-targeted models. Instead the company updated one product -- the MacBook Pro. That computer line was certainly due for an update. But the MacBook Pro is a relatively pricey laptop targeted at professional users, an important but niche audience. Even if Apple scored a direct hit with them, a new MacBook Pro line by itself won't revive Apple's flagging computer sales. The new computers have a cool feature: a touch sensitive bar called the Touch Bar that will display different buttons and features depending on what program is being used. But right now, the Touch Bar is only available on models that start at $1,800, a pricey sum even for professionals. And even as Apple was adding the new Touch Bar, it was taking away or excluding features that professional want and need. Many potential customers criticized the new computers for being underpowered in terms of their graphics processors and the amount of memory they can support. Others hated the fact that the new computers, like the MacBook before them, only have USB-C ports, which means they'd have to buy lots of dongles to attach their older hard drives, external monitors, cameras and the like. Unlike the older MacBook Pro models, the new ones won't have an SD card slot, so users will have to have another dongle to upload photos and videos saved to one. The take of Michael Tsai, a Mac developer, was typical of Apple's core fans. "I was really disappointed with today's Apple event," wrote Tsai on his blog. "It seems like Apple has either lost its way, that it has lost touch with what (some of) its customers want, or that it simply doesn't care about those customers." And, let's be clear, this backlash was against a product that Apple had actually revamped and had, based on its recent standards, been updating regularly. Other products -- and their fans -- haven't been so lucky. It would be one thing if the rest of the market were standing still or if Apple's products were so far beyond the competition that the company could afford to stand pat or if the company's sales were continuing to grow gangbusters despite its neglect. But none of those things is true. And that's not to mention all the new markets from smart home products to virtual and augmented reality that Apple is basically ignoring. But, hey, that Touch Bar sure looks neat. I just hope Apple executives aren't shocked when it doesn't spark a rebound for the company. © 2016 San Jose Mercury News syndicated under contract with NewsEdge. All rights reserved. Tell Us What You Think Comment: Name: Silvio: Posted: 2016-11-13 @ 1:26am PT Good article. By trying to look cool, Apple lost its coolness because the VERY act of trying to be cool makes the "trier" uncool. Also how cool one will look with all those adaptors hanging off a machine? Removing essential ports from the Pro line up is extremely dumb. Not to mention eliminating a super cool feature like the magnetic port! Oh wait! Hold on! By not having the cord snap off computers will now either damage the port or charger tip or go straight onto the ground... either way it will need to be repaired! Oh I get it! The keyboard is essentially useless. Touch bar a gimmick, really! And what is this apple fascination with emojis?! Please! The iPhone innovative features have been on Android for ages! The slow and minimal updates in its line up are pathetic. I'm an Apple guy, but have slowly been pushed away. Photos for example are all on Google Photos which Apple's old iPhoto only NOW has features that are similar and carbon copy of Google's. My next phone will be a Nexus and the day someone makes a system as easy as Apple, so will be my computer. All of my friends think the same and many have shifted. Brexit in the U.K., Trump in the White House, Apple users on windows and Google... who would have thought... Michael Crab: Posted: 2016-11-08 @ 11:40am PT "Apple no longer makes anything I care to buy," I think this is the most telling quote from the article. I believed Apple supporters to be the most die hard when it comes to their mobile devices. I recently met another person that switched to the new Pixel XL from a an iphone 6S plus and was astounded at how easy the process was.

The company is not offering any fabulous deals, but it is throwing in free next-day shipping for in-stock iPhones, including the iPhone 7.  ( Apple ) Advertisement While most of the world is now gearing up for Black Friday deals, Apple is already thinking about Christmas and has launched its 2016 Holiday Gift Guide. Unsurprisingly, the Apple 2016 Holiday Gift Guide recommends an Apple device for everyone. Even less surprisingly, Apple devices are among the most popular holiday gifts each year, so Apple's gift guide might actually come in handy for generous Christmas shoppers looking to lavish their dear ones with expensive gadgets. "There's an art to finding the perfect gift," says Apple. "And nothing can bring to life the passion and creativity of the people on your list like a gift from Apple." The guide contains a number of product recommendations, highlighting its most powerful devices currently available for purchase. The iPhone, MacBook, iPad, Apple Watch, Apple TV, accessories and gift cards are all included in the holiday shopping guide, so basically Apple thinks that all of its devices and products would make great gifts this Christmas. Considering how popular Apple devices generally are, the company is probably right. The latest MacBook Pro and iPhone 7 are already top-selling devices and many Apple fans are likely putting them on their Christmas lists already. That said, Apple is not offering any special deals or perks with this guide, it's simply listing what it has to offer in case you might want to put it under a Christmas tree. iPhone 7 Free Next-Day Shipping The company is offering free shipping on various products, but these vary by country and by product. For interested shoppers in the United States, Apple is offering free next-day shipping for any iPhone, including the latest iPhone 7, if the phone is in stock and the order is placed by 5:00 p.m. local time. Free Two-Day Shipping On Other Apple Products While the much touted iPhone 7 comes with free next-day shipping, other Apple products come with free two-day shipping. This offer is also for U.S. customers who purchase the product by 5:00 p.m. local time, provided the product is in stock. For Canada, all customers will get free standard shipping for all products Apple sells. For the UK, Apple is offering free next-day shipping on products that are in stock, provided the order is placed by 7 p.m. local time. This applies to orders of at least £40. For other Western European countries such as France, Spain, Germany and the Netherlands, Apple offers free next-day deliver for in-stock products that cost at least €40, provided that the order is placed between 3 p.m. and 5 p.m. local time.

(SR) From our archive, 100 years ago The Spokane Daily Chronicle was trying to build anticipation for one of Spokane’s big annual events, the National Apple Show. The opening parade – which the Chronicle called, variously “The Pageant of King Apple,” and “King Pip’s Parade” – was being described in terms nothing short of hyperbolic. “We are going to uncork all of the carnival spirit within hundreds of miles of Spokane for the big celebration Friday,” said the parade chairman. “… King Pip and his royal court will be escorted by a pick bodyguard from each of a number of local organizations and will have a guest of honor King Boreas of St. Paul, who is coming to Spokane with President Louis W. Hill of the Great Northern … “The pageant will move from the Davenport Hotel to the Apple Show grounds along streets brilliantly illuminated with red fire. Every person in the parade will be in costume and the two kings — of Apple Land and the St. Paul Carnival — will be carried in a manner befitting their high rank and dignity.” The Chronicle also announced that it would hold its sixth annual cooking school at the Apple Show. A fancy $90 Arcadian De Luze range would “be given to the woman baking the best apple pie.” Published: Nov. 11, 2016, midnight  Tags: agriculture, apple pie, apples, National Apple Show, This day in history Click here to comment on this story » ​ Follow the Spokesman wherever you are: Facebook Twitter Newsletter Subscribe Unlimited Digital Access Print edition home delivery Help Customer Service Sitemap Directory Subscriber Services Classifieds Classifieds Advertising Obituaries More Staff Cowles Jobs Archives/Research Buy photo reprints Jumble Crossword Horoscopes Contact Us Downtown Spokane 999 W Riverside Ave Spokane, Wa 99201 Mailing Address P.O.

The ad and search giant points out in a neat animated GIF that of the 39 bundled apps on an iPhone, all 39 of them stem from Apple; on a Lumia 550, 39 of the 47 apps are from Microsoft; but lovely Google only has 11 of the 38 pre-installed apps on a Galaxy S7. The argument is a little obtuse since the EC's biggest concern is not the percentage of apps but the fact that Google forces all Android-based phone manufacturers to include its full suite of Google apps – everything from Gmail to Maps to Chrome and YouTube – if they want to add the Play Store to the phone. Since the store is critical to finding and installing quality apps, and installing some security patches, and hence allows a device to function as a competent handheld, the EC argues that Google is abusing its power. Google's response amounts to: if you think we're bad, you should see what others are up to. Plus, it says with wide puppy-dog eyes, bundling its other products with the app store means that it can give people everything for free. If it stopped doing that – the pleading look turning to a gentle growl – it may have to start charging fees. "This free distribution is an efficient solution for everyone - it lowers prices for phone makers and consumers, while still letting us sustain our substantial investment in Android and Play," Google's general counsel Kent Walker notes. Number three The response is the third by the company to a wide-ranging antitrust investigation by the EC. It looked at five areas of concern with Google: content scraping, maps and localized search, advertising, price-comparison features for online shopping, and Android. The EC lodged formal charges on the latter three and Google is finally responding – after a number of extensions – to the last one. We don't have the full response from Google to Europe but it has produced what we can assume is a version of it arguments in an official blog post, complete with GIFs. As well as pointing out it has fewer pre-installed apps than its smartphone rivals, and that it allows rival apps to be installed, Google also complains that the very fact that the iPhone exists is evidence that it is not abusing its position. "To ignore competition with Apple," writes Walker, "is to miss the defining feature of today’s competitive smartphone landscape." In fact, Google says, if anything it has made competition possible. "European developers are able to distribute their apps to over a billion people around the world," his post argues. "Android is not a 'one way street'; it's a multi-lane highway of choice." As for Google flexing its muscles on the hardware side, Walker paints its influence as "working with hardware makers to establish a minimum level of compatibility among Android devices." And argues that it gives manufacturers "wide latitude to build devices that go above that baseline." Fragile What's more, even though Google is one of the largest companies in the world and that there are well over a billion active Android users, the whole thing is, apparently, incredibly delicate. "Open-source platforms are fragile," Walker warns. "They survive and grow by balancing the needs of all participants, including users and developers. The Commission’s approach would upset this balance, and send an unintended signal favouring closed over open platforms. It would mean less innovation, less choice, less competition, and higher prices. That wouldn’t be just a bad outcome for us. It would be a bad outcome for developers, for phone makers and carriers, and, most critically, for consumers." To be fair to Google, it does take a lighter touch than other phone companies, and in some cases, its approach seems to be too lax – such as the broken security update approach where some phones sit unpatched for months or simply not at all. But everything that Google says can be true and it can still be abusing its market power. Just because you help an old granny over the road doesn't mean you can kick a dog. Plus, of course, Android devices now account for three-quarters of the smartphone market in Europe, and that share is increasing. If the EC didn't investigate and didn't put pressure on Google to make sure it is not abusing that enormous level of control, the commission wouldn't be doing its job. As to where things will end up, it's hard to tell. The EC has a long history of wielding antitrust measures against US tech companies. In recent years, it has picked fights with Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook. In some cases, the EC has largely walked away; in others, it has spent years fighting for changes such as when it forced Microsoft to offer Windows without Windows Player. There is of course one additional factor in play now: with president-elect Donald Trump entering the White House in the new year, the extremely cosy relationship between the Obama Administration and Google will come to an end. Without high-level political backing, Google may find its sheen is less bright in political quarters. ® Sponsored: Customer Identity and Access Management Tips and corrections 41 Comments Whitepapers Data and Analytics Maturity Model and Business Impact How top performing enterprises use their IT investments to store, process, and use data to make more effective, real-time decisions.

Investors have been warned to brace for more sharp moves on financial markets as uncertainty endures over how Trump’s campaign rhetoric will translate into policies. Related: Dow Jones hits record high on Trump bump, but London market falters - as it happened But after initially struggling to find direction on Thursday the Dow closed up 218 points at 18807, a rise of 1.17%. The S&P 500 also gained slightly, rising 0.2% but the tech-heavy Nasdaq dipped 0.81%. Trump has clashed with Silicon Valley and threatened Apple, Nasdaq and the world’s largest company, over privacy and its overseas manufacturing. Apple dropped 2.79% on Thursday. Markets benefitted from a continuing sense of relief over Trump’s conciliatory tone in his early remarks, including those following his meeting with the US president, Barack Obama. However European shares, including London’s FTSE 100 index, could not hold on to their early gains as worries grew over the president-elect’s coming longer term impact on global growth due to his protectionist policies. The billionaire businessman vowed on the campaign trail to put American jobs first and scrap or renegotiate trade deals. European markets were also hurt by investors moving their money out of shares and into bonds as yields rose on the prospect that the arrival of a big spender in the White House would mean the US had to issue more government debt. A new flurry of bonds coming on to the market would push down the price of bonds, and yields would move inversely to prices. Related: How America's new president will affect the global economy “It has been another interesting day for the FTSE 100, with the index retreating from the morning high, hit by heavy losses for high dividend stocks, which are looking less attractive after the pickup in US bond yields,” said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at the online trading company IG. The FTSE 100 closed down 1.2% at 6827.98, having gained 1% on Wednesday after Trump’s presidential victory was confirmed. Analysts said the FTSE’s change in direction during the day Thursday reflected a sense of confusion over whether Trump would match tough talk during the presidential race with action once in power. “It is perhaps apt that the reaction to Donald Trump’s victory has been so confused, flipping between bombast and baloney much in the same manner as the soon-to-be president,” said Connor Campbell, financial analyst at the spread betting firm Spreadex. “That’s all well and good for the short-term, especially for those traders looking to benefit from the present volatility; one suspects the seemingly rudderless movements may soon wear thin, however.” There were clear winners and losers from Trump’s presidential victory. His vows to ramp up spending on defence and infrastructure boosted stocks in the defence, construction and commodity sector. The prospect of looser regulation lifted shares in banks. Analysts said more muddled days of trading lay ahead as investors continued to weigh the potential impact of a Trump presidency on different stocks, sectors and regions as well as on the global economy as a whole. “Global growth could be somewhat slower in the years ahead if protectionism takes hold. The additional uncertainty will have a negative impact on equity markets but the extent needs to be kept in perspective,” said Glyn Owen at Momentum Global Investment Management. “On balance we believe that markets will drift for a period in the face of the uncertainty and the increased volatility we have seen in recent weeks will be a feature for the year ahead.” On currency markets there was some respite for the pound as it jumped to a six-week high against the euro and rose against the dollar. Traders put the small recovery in the pound – which has tumbled since the UK’s vote to leave the EU – down to political worries now shifting to mainland Europe. A series of elections are due in Europe next year with the Dutch, French and Germans going to the polls, and possibly the Italians too if their government loses a key referendum next month. After Trump’s win there are predictions that populist movements in those countries will gain further ground. Against that backdrop the pound was up 1.5% against a flagging euro, to €1.1537 in late trading. The pound was up 1.4% against the dollar to $1.2578. That in turn put further pressure on the FTSE 100. The internationally diverse stock index has benefited from the pound’s post-referendum weakness because it has flattered the earnings of those component companies that report in dollars.

Join For Free Here are seven perils and pitfalls to avoid if you want your app to succeed in the language markets of your choice Why iOS localization? Business is international and Apple proves it. Reports from a year or two ago (2015) indicated that the company had started to sell more iPhones in China than it was already selling in the US. Of course, Apple also sells its iOS-based products all over the world. For product managers for iOS apps, that means an opportunity and a threat. If you don’t move to address the needs of different international markets, competitors will fill the void, build up their user bases, and attack you in your home market from a position of globally massive strength. On the other hand, to market an iOS app to international markets for bigger market share and higher revenues, you have a head start. iPhones and iPads are multilingual by design, and make it easy for users to select the local language interfaces they favor. In addition, Apple offers tools to help your developers to produce local language versions of your app that make sense to your target users abroad. You may already be thinking that there is more to iOS localization than meets the eye. You’re right! Here are seven perils and pitfalls to avoid if you want your app to succeed in the language markets of your choice. 1. Thinking You Don’t Need All That IOS Localization What? After our inspiring remarks above, could anybody who has read this far doubt that localization is important, even essential to iOS app commercial success? The point we are making here is rather subtler. Don’t think that localization is simply about translating from one language to another. For instance, if you are an English-speaking person, your point of reference in terms of search engines is probably Google, the 800 pound SE gorilla in the Western world. But not in China (1 billion plus people), where Baidu beats Google. GALA, the Globalization and Localization Association, points out that “Baidu does better than Google because it looks and feels fully native to the Chinese-speaking audience.” The moral of the story is that localization may have to be done at more than one level, and that in some cases an overly shallow approach may not get you any more business benefit than no localization at all. 2. Confusing Internationalization and Localization This is a key point when you’re trying to hammer out release schedules of localized versions with your development team. Full of enthusiasm, you want your Japanese localized version now, and your Spanish version by yesterday. After all, it’s just a matter of handing the app over to translators, right? Not quite. What your development team is probably patiently trying to tell you is that before producing these different localized versions, the software needs to be internationalized. Internationalization essentially ensures that your app can be sensibly localized into any language. It takes care of aspects like number and date formats, changing positions of variables in sentences according to language, and plurals. As an eye-opener, ask your development team how plurals work in Russian and Hebrew, for example, compared to English. Luckily, Apple’s iOS development framework offers developers tools to help get plurals and other tricky issues right the first time for any language. Once the internationalization has been done properly, localization into a specific language is more a matter of handing over a file for translation to a competent translator or translation agency. A decision about whether to add a new localized language can then be as simple as a calculation taking into account the potential additional revenue compared with the translation costs and support effort. 3. Not Distinguishing Between Different Versions of the Same Language Do you think English is the same, wherever it’s used? A quick look at date formats between US and UK English will prove the contrary. If you tell a British native that it’s October 5 using a US date format (10/5), he or she will think you mean May 10. And how about Chinese? GALA suggests that 30 percent of the Chinese population does not speak the country’s national language. Chinese consists of seven different versions or linguistic classifications: Gan (Jiangzinese), Guan (Mandarin), Kejia (Hakka), Min (Hokkien), Wu (Shanghainese), Xiang (Hunanese) and Yue (Cantonese). Mandarin Chinese federates 1.3 billion speakers worldwide, but Cantonese and the Min language are in close second and third position. The equivalent in the US market, for instance, would be to produce different versions of your app for New Yorkers, Texans, Californians, and Alaskans. In the US, this extra effort would be unlikely to make business sense, because standard US English is understood across the country. By comparison, for China, the effort is essential because many people using one version of Chinese will simply not understand people using another version. 4. Missing Or Mishandling Key Localization Aspects Of An App Don’t expect your developers to cover absolutely all the bases when it comes to localization. While they may correctly identify the different user-facing texts in the app, including help and error messages, they may not appreciate other niceties. One example is keyword optimization to help your localized iOS app garner more attention and more users in the Apple App Store. In this case, you cannot even rely on the correct translation of the keywords that work for your iOS app in your home market. The reason for this is that keywords that work for a given market depend on factors specific to that market, such as culture, politics, and national or regional events. For instance, linking your app to a popular presidential candidate in the US could do wonders for take-up in America. Yet it may fall flat in Germany, where they have their own national politics to keep them busy. Localization of a keyword has to be done from the inside out, so to speak, by first finding out which local language keywords are important to potential users of your app within that country and how fierce the local competition is to be ranked on such keywords. 5. Using Automated Translation For understanding the general sense of a text written in a foreign language, automated translation software can be useful. However, for making a favorable impression on end-users, it can leave a lot to be desired. Such software can give very good results in some cases, and very bad results in others, but you’ll never know whether you’re getting the good or the bad. A classic example is the phrase “The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak,” ending up translated into other languages as “The wine is ready, but the meat is underdone.” So don’t give in to pressure from your development team to simply run your app’s file for localization through an automated translation system. They may not have developed your superior sensitivity to the far-reaching linguistic and cultural issues at stake (unless you give them this article to read.) While automated systems continue to improve in quality, there is no guarantee they will be able to replace human translation, at least in the foreseeable future. Competent human translation is therefore what you need, with empathy for your targeted end-users for a given localization. 6. Expecting Your Translators to Work “Blind” Context and situation are often vital pieces of information for a good iOS localization. A word in one language may have several completely different possible translations in another. Classic examples in English for iOS and other software applications are words like “run” and “clear.” Only additional information about the context can help a translator understand whether the words in question are nouns, verbs, adjectives, or some other grammatical construct. Checking translations after they have been done requires painstaking verification word by word. Murphy’s Law then says that the one or two incorrect translations that slip through will be precisely the ones that do maximum damage to the credibility and reputation of your app in its localized version. A better way forward is to give information to translators ahead of time, for instance as comments in the files to be translated. Your smarter, more localization-sensitive developers will already understand the desirability of doing this; you may have to gently educate the others. 7. Failing To Use Native Language Speakers to Test the Localized Version You need human translators to produce a localized version of your app. You also need native speaker human beings to check the final result. It is true that Apple gives developers tools to check if localization of words or phrases has been missed, or if translations will cause screen layout problems due to differences in length. These tools are valuable, but they do not replace native speaker capabilities and judgment about the overall quality of a translation, and whether the localization will meet with approval and subscriptions in the market concerned. Conclusion The big takeaway from all this is that successful iOS localization is about seeing things from the point of view of the customer or user in the market you are targeting. This is a simple to say, but not always easy to do. Nevertheless, two important factors can help your iOS localizations to succeed. The first is that the localization tools Apple provides within the iOS framework can help your developers better understand and handle the issues of different languages. The second is that localization tools and local market experts and are available, externally if not internally, to give you an objective appraisal of what works in your localized app and what should be improved. So with these resources to help you, good luck… or rather, good localization!

REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/File Photo 3/3 By David Morgan | WASHINGTON WASHINGTON Donald Trump's White House victory moves Apple (AAPL.O), Pfizer (PFE.N), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and other big U.S. corporations much closer than they have been in years to winning a big tax break on $2.6 trillion in foreign profits. Tax reform is shaping up as among the most fruitful areas for cooperation between Trump and his fellow Republicans, who held control in Tuesday's elections of both the House of Representatives and the Senate. Trump and congressional Republicans have separate, but similar, tax reform plans. Both would slash tax rates on businesses, simplify and cut individual taxes, and let companies bring overseas profits into the country at a low tax rate, raising prospects for a sweeping deal on taxes. Bipartisan support for corporate tax reform has been growing as multinational companies have amassed tax-deferred profits abroad and brought continuous lobbying pressure over a decade for a tax break on them. "On tax policy, he's basically adopted the House blueprint as his approach," said Rohit Kumar, co-leader of the tax policy services practice at Big Four accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers [PWC.UL]. "There's a better chance that something happens next year than there has been at any point in the last several years." At the heart of the issue is a law that lets U.S. companies hold foreign profits overseas without paying U.S. corporate tax on them, unless and until those profits are brought into the United States, which is known as repatriation. Corporations have $2.6 trillion stashed abroad under this law. That money could be repatriated any time, but businesses choose not to because it would incur the 35 percent statutory corporate income tax. Trump and House Republicans, including Speaker Paul Ryan, would still need to agree on how to pay for lower corporate tax rates and on whether U.S.-based multinationals should pay U.S. taxes on future foreign profits. Trump and congressional Republicans would also need support for tax reform from Democrats if they intend to present the package as a benefit for the country as a whole, analysts say. Such proposals have stumbled before on Democrats' objections that they are corporate give-away, and on Republicans' insistence that they be paired with a cut in the corporate income tax rate. Democrats could still block legislation they dislike from reaching the floor of the Senate, which requires a super majority of 60 votes to advance a measure, but there are procedural maneuvers Republicans could use to bypass them. The one-time surge in revenue that would result from repatriation could help fund another cornerstone of Trump's campaign platform -- a pledge to boost the economy through big investments in U.S. highways, roads, bridges, airports and seaports. Infrastructure spending was not a campaign priority for congressional Republicans. But a new job-creating program could appeal to Democrats and be valuable to lawmakers in the 2018 mid-term elections. The four companies with the largest profits held overseas are: Apple Inc ($200 billion), Pfizer Inc ($194 billion), Microsoft Corp ($108 billion) and General Electric Co (GE.N) ($104 billion), according to March estimates by Citizens for Tax Justice, a corporate income tax watchdog group in Washington. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2eBx2BO). The European Commission in August hit Apple with a 13 billion euro ($14.3 billion) bill for back taxes, fanning concerns among other U.S. multinationals and U.S. officials that their untaxed foreign revenues could be vulnerable to further European penalties. Apple CEO Tim Cook told an interviewer in September that he expects to repatriate billions of dollars in global profits to the United States in 2017 but did not say how. He said in another interview that the company would not bring money back unless there was "a fair rate" and said he was optimistic that tax reform would occur next year. BUSINESS SUPPORT The House tax plan, which Ryan and other leading Republicans promoted throughout the campaign, would lower the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent, force multinationals to repatriate existing foreign earnings and adopt a "territorial" system that would largely end taxation of U.S. companies' foreign income. Trump is calling for a steeper rate cut to 15 percent, and he has proposed a 10 percent tax rate for repatriated overseas profits held in cash, payable over a decade. Some are optimistic that those differences can be overcome. "In the end, there are no differences that can't be solved on the tax issue," said Republican Representative Tom Cole. The House Republican plan has had significant support from business. Kumar's PwC advises the Alliance for Competitive Taxation, which lobbies on tax reform for over 40 companies ranging from Alcoa Inc (AA.N) and Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) to Alphabet's Google Inc (GOOGL.O), Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N). "We know what we want," said Dorothy Coleman, a tax policy expert at the National Association of Manufacturers, referring to a lower corporate tax rate, adopting a "modern, competitive" territorial system, and a permanent R&D credit among other wishes. The House's corporate tax plan would cut revenues by more than $890 billion over 10 years, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. The same research group says Trump's corporate plan would reduce revenues by $2.6 trillion. Trump and Republicans in Congress view tax reform as a way to jump-start economic growth and job creation. Business lobbyists say that higher tax revenues from a growing economy would address much of the House plan's shortfall. Trump advisers say revenue erosion posed by the president-elect's plan would be overcome by growth and policy initiatives including a more aggressive approach to trade.
