Follow @UPROXX Member Sign Up Sign In What Does It Mean If Universal Music Group Is Really Banning Streaming Exclusives? #Drake Bansky Gonzalez 08.23.16 3 months ago Facebook Twitter EMAIL Getty Image Streaming services like Apple Music, Spotify and Tidal have spent the past few years gradually gobbling up shares of the music market, essentially changing the way music is consumed and released, so much so that Billboard eventually changed their calculations for charting music sales. It’s been an adjustment, and labels have stood by idly watching the climate change under their noses, but now Universal Music Group may be implementing a drastic policy and changing the entire process in one fell swoop. According to High Snobiety, UMG sent out a company-wide email Monday essentially banning exclusive streaming rights for all of their releases going forward. The alleged ban comes on the first business day after one of UMG’s artists, Frank Ocean, released two albums exclusively on Apple Music, the visual album Endless and the traditional album Blonde. The move is a game changer as UMG is home to nearly 80 record labels including Interscope, Capitol, Def Jam, Motown, Priority, Republic and artist-ran subsidiaries like Kanye West’s GOOD Music, Cash Money, Dr. Dre’s Aftermath, Eminem’s Shady, J. Cole’s Dreamville and more. UMG is also home to all five of this year’s Grammy nominees for Album of the Year — Kendrick Lamar, Taylor Swift, The Weeknd, Chris Stapleton and Alabama Shakes — as well as seven of 2015’s 10 best-selling albums and 38.5 percent of the year’s recorded music and 2016’s biggest selling artist, Drake. The ban would strip streaming services of some of the power they’ve obtained as the market has changed and streaming music has become more prevalent than actually purchasing music. The removal of exclusivity would increase the potential reach of any given album, but more importantly it should stop streaming services from acting as de-facto record labels and securing artists on their roster like Apple has done with Chance The Rapper or Tidal has with Beyoncé and Lil Wayne, allowing the artist to release music independently, sans label, at their leisure. With a roster as large as UMG’s, the move is sure to make a dent but may not become the industry standard just yet. Exclusive rights are never truly exclusive, and mostly serve to allow one streaming service to have the album and or songs from a particular artist first and works two-fold for the artist: first, by releasing the music digitally first it prevents leaks that are customary with physical product and second, it allows them an extra revenue stream as record sales continue to plummet. Securing a deal with Apple, for example, often lands that artist’s music in playlists that are pushed by Apple, essentially giving the artist and their album a sales boost by placing the music onto consumers playlists even if they don’t choose to listen to that artist themselves. This practice may have been the cause of Drake’s astronomical sales of his album Views, and with all the special Frank Ocean playlists throughout the weekend it assuredly helped pad his sales of Blonde as well. It’s just a rumor for now, and practices within the company aren’t certain to become public knowledge, but their next big release from the Universal group will be telling. But what would be more telling is if another music conglomerate follows suit, and that could be the death knell for streaming exclusivity entirety.

Ever since downloads took a backseat and streaming became the priority for artists and labels, there has been a lot of talk around “exclusive” releases. Over the past 18 months or so, some of the biggest artists in the world have chosen to go for an exclusive window of release with one service or another, but the major players in the cold war have been Apple and TIDAL. RELATED Album Review: Frank Ocean – ‘Blonde’ Teyana Taylor Hadn’t Seen The ‘Fade’ Video Before It Aired on MTV VMAs While artists such as Beyonce, Jay Z and Kanye West have favored TIDAL (where they own a stake), Frank Ocean and Drake have signed deals with Apple Music for their albums. It’s now an open secret that the artists receive some sort of extra compensation for the exclusivity, although none of the streaming companies have revealed the amounts so far. Some argue that the “exclusive” releases are good in the long run because it keeps filling the artists’ pockets but others believe that the practice is very “anti-consumer” and thus needs to stop as soon as possible. The latter section of folks also believes that it is almost unfair trade practice and that the music fan should be left open to decide which service(s) he/she wants to subscribe to, based solely on the quality and user experience. Last month, Kanye West, who himself released his latest album The Life of Pablo exclusively on TIDAL, surprised many when he ranted about the Tidal-Apple “beef” and supported the theory that it’s messing up the music industry. So who is going to take the first step? According to legendary music critic and analyst Bob Lefsetz (you can read about him here if you are unaware of his credentials), Chairman and CEO of Universal Music Group, Lucian Grainge has sent an email to all executives in the company to end all future exclusive releases for artists on its roster. Lefsetz revealed this in an email sent out to subscribers of his newsletter. “Lucian Grainge sent out an email to Universal executives today ending all future exclusives with Universal artists.” Just a couple days ago, Lefsetz sent out a newsletter to his subscribers ranting about the trend of exclusive releases and slammed Frank Ocean for following it just to make some extra money. If this development is true, it is indeed a huge one. Remember that Universal Music Group is the parent company for labels like Republic (Drake), Def Jam (Kanye West, G.O.O.D. Music, Frank Ocean, Justin Bieber), Interscope (Eminem, Dr. Dre) and many more. If this goes through, it will certainly be another twist in the ever changing music industry which continues to struggle in terms of finding a way of making all players in the game happy. UPDATE: Leading digital streaming service Deezer, who recently made its official entry into the U.S. just a few days ago, has released a statement to HHNM in light of Universal’s reported stand. Deezer has voiced its opinion in favor of non-exclusives in interest of the consumers. “We want to offer our users the best possible experience, and support artists by providing a fair and legal streaming service. We believe exclusives often compromise both of these by encouraging piracy and locking users into services they don’t want. While exclusives provide a short term benefit to the service, they ultimately pose more limitations on musicians creating a barrier between artists and their fans.” More on our site Lupe Fiasco Sends Message To Kanye West (Video) Gucci Mane Proposes To Girlfriend Keyshia Ka’oir at Hawks-Pelicans Game (Video) Chance The Rapper Reportedly Cancels Rest of European Tour Due to “Personal Reasons” RATE THIS: Loading... Follow @HipHopNMore Guest It would only be ironic if he was praising Frank Ocean’s exclusivity, and then he sent out a letter shutting down exclusive streams. If he slammed an exclusive release a week early, then banned his company from releasing exclusive streaming the next, that would be expected. Not ironic.

 This is the best tech upgrade I’ve ever made, and it only cost me $27 Kelsey Mulvey, Insider Picks Aug. 22, 2016, 7:04 PM 15,138 facebook linkedin twitter email print The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like. Business Insider has affiliate partnerships so we may get a share of the revenue from your purchase. Amazon I've always had a frugal approach to headphones. I only upgraded from the Apple EarPods that came with my iPhone last year. Since joining the Insider Picks team in May, though, I've read a lot about Bluetooth headphones. The whole concept of charging your headphones had previously sounded bizarre to me, but curiosity — and Apple's decision to ditch the headphone jack for its latest iPhone — got the best of me, so I decided to give them a try. I picked out TaoTronics' sport headphones on Amazon after reading some of their more than 3,600 customer reviews, and they're easily the best tech upgrade I've ever made.  The first thing that attracted me to this pair was the design: They look sharp and feel substantial enough to last me good long while. And after using them for a few weeks now, I can report they're also comfortable. The earbuds fit snugly in my ears and stay put when I go running, plus the back cord that joins the two buds rests nicely on my upper back and doesn't flagrantly flap around. The sound is great, and the pair even has some discrete inline buttons so I can play, pause, and adjust the volume of whatever song I'm listening to without touching my phone. But, as someone who's never put much thought into headphones, great design, comfort, and sound quality aren't what turned me into a Bluetooth believer. The freedom that comes with Bluetooth headphones is the real game-changer. I like to put my phone away and enjoy my company, surroundings, and in this case, music. Sure, my phone is still in my bag when I'm walking around my neighborhood listening to Adele. But since my headphones aren't plugged into it, I can leave it stowed away in my bag and not be glued to my screen. The one place these headphones have proved the most useful is the gym. Back in my corded ones, my phone would regularly fly off the treadmill or stationary bike if I made any sudden movements, with my headphones right behind it. Now, my phone stays put, my headphones stay in my ears, and I'm a lot happier for that. There are still some things that I'm getting used to. Since they're not plugged into anything, I'm always worried that my headphones will suddenly disconnect and everyone will hear that I listen to "Hamilton" while I run. And then there's the whole mind-boggling process of actually charging your Bluetooth headphones. But, all things considered, those are two small prices to pay for clear, unrestricted sound.  TaoTronics Bluetooth 4. 1 Headphones, $26.99, available at Amazon.

Did Apple Abandoned iPhone 7 Pro? A reliable source of Apple rumors, blogsite Macotakara (via Forbes) recently revealed that Apple is gearing towards releasing iPhone 7 and iPhone Plus, "According to the usually reliable Mac Otakara: the 'iPhone 7 Pro' is no more." Like Us on Facebook Subscribe to eNewsletter As Forbes translated, "In a new report the Japanese site explains that Apple decided there is no need to add a new top of the range model above the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. While it will use the 'iPhone 7' moniker for the range to avoid customer confusion, after toying with new branding given the range still uses the core iPhone 6 design launched in 2014." No Concrete News for iPhone 7 Pro With latest rumors surrounding the next big announcement from Apple, some insiders are now suggesting that Apple may have cancelled introducing iPhone 7 Pro; instead, the said smartphone might come at a later date with a new name, suggesting previous rumors that Apple will come to a new dawn of naming its phones after this year. In fact, recent reports about iPhone 7 Pro are just a bunch of rumors, speculations and the likes, but when it comes to talks about iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, there is concrete evidence suggesting their specifications, features and even the price of the two phones.

Apple's Next iPhones are iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, ONLY While speculations that Apple may totally dump the idea of introducing iPhone 7 Pro this coming September are not totally confirmed, the said reports came from a very reliable source, thus, this could prove to have a big bearing. In the same report from Macotakara, the blogsite revealed, "It seems that the performance of the camera is much improved, the Electrostatic Capacitance home button and A10 chip are introduced and that 3.5mm headphone jack is not implemented any more. As the basic design would be fundamentally changed, it seems the number is going to be renewed." So this coming September, you might want to expect only two brand new iPhone models when Apple makes the announcement at their Cupertino office.   Right Now Amazing 1-Year-Old Child Plays A Piano Concert On Her First Birthday.

So much so that Main Street will close for the 150-plus vendors and more than 15,000 people. Locals will find familiar food and family activities, along with more music, art, and community involvement. Musicians will perform both days on at least three stages—17 bands on the Main Stage. In keeping with the Felice Brothers’ roots-folk-rock feel, Whiskey Treaty Roadshow will open, and Jamie Kent will come from Northampton fresh from a tour with Huey Lewis & The News. Restaurants and shops are open late Saturday. During the day, the town will fill with photography and paintings, handmade jewelry, clothing, alpaca wool, woodworking, and more. Big Elm Brewing, Balderdash Cellars, and Hilltop Orchards (home of Furnace Brook Winery) will offer craft-wine and beer tastings. And food will range from local barbecue to Mary Zabian’s towering cakes and St. Helena’s Chapel’s corn chowder. And, of course, apples—caramel apples, apple pies and sauce, and cider, hard and fresh.  This article appears in the September 2016 issue of TownVibe Berkshire Did you like what you read here?

When you want to listen to music or watch a video, you will have to connect your headphones through the lightning port, or use Bluetooth ones. Today, we take a look at the pros and cons of the decision to give up the audio jack. Bluetooth If the audio jack goes missing, a large number of people will prefer getting a pair of Bluetooth headphones. This is good news for Apple, as it recently acquired Beats — and Beats has a dominating market share in Bluetooth headphones. Lightning Back in 2014, Apple introduced certain guidelines for headphones that connected through lightning. The numerous advantages of lightning headphones include lossless audio, and active noise cancellation. Not the first to do it Although Apple was the first to pop up in rumors as the company that killed the audio jack, it certainly wasn’t the first to implement the idea. Motorola (owned by Lenovo) and LeEco have both debuted devices which boast of superior lossless audio — because the headphones don’t connect via 3.5mm jack. It is being said that a number of companies are waiting to see what Apple does with the lightning connector on the iPhone, so that they can find a way to implement the idea into their flagships as well. Legacy of dropping legacy Apple has a long and proven history of getting rid of old technologies to pave the way for newer ideas — and SCSI, floppy disks and DVD drives are prime examples of this. Thinner iPhones Although the 3.5mm port looks tiny, it does occupy some space — especially if you consider how thin today’s flagships are. Removing the 3.5mm audio jack from iPhone 6S — which is just 7.1mm thin — could remove an additional 1mm! Better waterproofing A number of analysts believe that one less port on the iPhone will mean better implementation of waterproofing, if Apple debuts it this year. Ditching the 3.5mm audio jack gets rid of a port which could serve as an entrance for water. Higher quality audio If you start using lightning headphones instead of the ones that connect via 3.5mm jack, you will notice a bump in the audio quality — and that is because there is no need for a digital-to-analog conversion to happen. Better audio amplification Considering Apple’s specifications for lightning headphones, manufacturers can factor in an amplifier inside the headphone. This amplifier will draw power from the iPhone, via the lightning port. Although this may impact battery life, it also guarantees much better sound. What benefits the most The aspect of iPhone that will benefit the most from the ditching of the audio jack is the display real estate. Apple is likely to head in the direction of creating a phone that has zero moving parts — just like a slate. Ditching the audio jack to create more usable space will translate into a haptic home button. This home button will have some resemblance to the trackpad found in the 12” MacBook — it won’t move, but it will give haptic feedback that feels like clicking. Major cons When you actually think about it, you will realize that absence of a headphones jack on the iPhone will mean the demise of all the expensive wired headphones that you own. Apple is expected to include a little dongle with an audio jack on one end, and lightning port on the other. And yes, that means another thing to carry around just for media consumption. Note that if the audio becomes completely digital, it will become far easier for music labels to pave the way for stricter DRM.

The man who co–founded Apple with Steve Jobs has expressed grave concerns about the company’s plans to ditch the standard headphone slot in the forthcoming iPhone 7. Steve Wozniak predicted that Apple would face a barrage of criticism if leaks and rumours about the company’s plans were true. “If it’s missing the 3.5mm earphone jack, that’s going to tick off a lot of people,” he said. Wozniak went on to say that he does not believe existing wireless technology can take up the slack and that traditional headphones are the superior option. “I would not use Bluetooth … I don’t like wireless. I have cars where you can plug in the music, or go through Bluetooth, and Bluetooth just sounds so flat for the same music.” “If there’s a Bluetooth 2 that has higher bandwidth and better quality, that sounds like real music, I would use it. But we’ll see. Apple is good at moving towards the future, and I like to follow that.” Wozniak went on to say that he thought Apple should offer the same USB–C connector found in its MacBooks and rival Android phones. He believes that the standardised port is the future for smartphones and tablets. Despite 300,000 people signing petition to try and prevent Apple from ditching the 3.5mm headphone jack, it now seems certain that the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will only offer headphone connections via its Lightning charging port. Both phones are due out at the start of September. Source: AFR Was this article helpful?

(AAPL) Co-Founder Indicates Disapproval Over Headphone Jack Replacement In iPhone 7 The co-founder of Apple believes that lightening connector on the iPhone 7 will frustrate many users Published By: Ken Bock on August 23, 2016 02:17 pm EST Facebook Google+ Twitter Pinterest Stumbleupon AAPL Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is all set to announce the next generation iPhone during its upcoming September event. As the tech giant is only a few days away from officially launching iPhone 7, speculations regarding the possible features of the upcoming smartphone have taken over the internet. Interestingly, one of the most popular rumors regarding the upcoming device is that it will incorporate a lightening connector instead of a standard 3.5mm headphone jack. Even though the developers of the next generation iPhone might have their reason for incorporating such an unusual change, the co-founder of Apple, Steve Wozniak, highly disagrees with the rumored implementation of a lightening connector. Mr. Steve Wozniak has clearly indicated his disapproval of lightening connector being implemented in the next iPhone, as he believes the rumored move will lead to a huge backlash from potential buyers of the device. He further added that majority of iPhone users are content with 3.5mm headphone jack, as it is the most common port found on any device. Not many users prefer using Bluetooth-connected headphones, which makes incorporating a lightening connector port a highly unpopular move. He stressed that even though users can connect a standard 3.5mm headphone to a lightening connector port via an adapter, but this process will prove to be highly inconvenient for users. According to reliable sources, another reason for the replacement is that the wireless connection will produce higher quality sound for users. Hence, the tech giant banks on the theory that users will learn to love the lightening connector port on the next generation iPhone model. However, incorporating such a drastic change ahead is still a huge risk that could potentially harm the smartphone’s sales once it is officially released next month.

(Photo : Drew Angerer/Getty Images) Samsung and Apple have been competing against each other for as long as everybody can remember. However, the release of the South Korean giant tech company's new flagship "phablet" device could be the best bribe to make iPhone users change their minds. Advertisement Cnet.com has initially has given the new device four and a half stars and said: "The Galaxy Note 7 is a beautiful, capable Android phone that showcases Samsung's best in design, battery life, speed and features. The 64GB base model leaves you plenty of space for photos, videos and games, and it's a real improvement over 2015's Note 5." Initial reviews cited some issues such as the device's price being too high ($849) and some minor problems with the S-Pen. However, after giving the device a go, users have found nothing wrong with the S-Pen. Samsung's small pen doesn't require a battery like the Apple Pencil which makes it perfect for on-the-go use, The Inquistr reported. The Note 7 may look like a monster smartphone at first with its 6.04 x 2.91 x 0.31 inches (153.5 x 73.9 x 7.9 mm) size and would even make you think it's a little heavy at first look. But, you will be surprised to know that it's lighter than what you had originally thought. The smartphone has a slick polished glass feeling only iPhone used to give. However, it's time to say bye-bye to Samsung's cheap looking plastic case, which the company used to use to keep the weight of their smartphones and tablets to a minimum.Gorilla Glass 5 was used to cover the front and back of the device. The new Gorilla Glass is said to stop scratches and, most importantly, prevent cracks in the device after falls. According to CNBC, analysts have branded Note 7 as an example of how the South Korean tech giant can remain on top at the edge of innovation. The Note 7 will "act as a premium showcase which will improve Samsung margins, define how Samsung's strategy differs from Apple and Huawei," analysts IHS said. Samsung has also fixed some screen issue they had with Galaxy S7 Edge and made sure the new Note 7's screen is perfect. S7 Edge's screen was curved a little too much making it easy to accidentally touch the curve with a finger. The new Note 7's screen has the same 2560 x 1440 pixel resolution as the Note 5 and the Galaxy S7 Edge but the screen don't extend too much. The Note 7 runs on the same Snapdragon 820 processor that runs the Galaxy S7 Edge which is a good thing. The same 4GB of RAM seen in the Galaxy Note 5 and the S7 Edge is also present in the new Note 7. There will be no problem running two or three apps at the same time, however, users will notice some lag when they run four app. Still, Note 7 is known to be the fastest phone in existence today, and yes, it's even faster than the iPhone6s or 6s Plus, nrt3.com reported. The iPhone maker has recently been struggling with its declining sales of iPhone if the leaks that have been surrounding the web are true, iPhone 7 could be a lifeless launch with nothing to make it stand out. Because there are a group of iPhone users who purchased the iPhone 6 when it was first launch, they may have already come to the end of their 2 year contract. Surely, these customers are looking for a stand-out up grade, and if Samsung gets the marketing right, this could change the hearts of a lot of Apple customers.

Features 10 Best Songs Album Of The Week Band To Watch Best Covers But Who's Buying? Cover Story Counting Down Interview Premature Evaluation Shut Up Dude Sounding Board Status Ain't Hood Straight To Video The 5 Best Songs Of The Week The Anniversary The Black Market The Week In Pop Ultimate Playlist Where's The Beef? All Features the latest // Status Ain't Hood E-40 Is A National Treasure Songs Videos Lists Share < br />this article: Universal Reportedly Bans Its Artists From Any More Streaming Exclusives Michael Nelson @nelsonicboom | August 23, 2016 - 7:08 pm Share < br />this article: A couple weeks ago, Chance The Rapper’s manager, Pat Corcoran, talked to Billboard about the Chicago rapper’s decision to release his recent mixtape, Coloring Book, as an Apple Music exclusive. It’s an interesting piece that offers a bunch of insight, but here’s the best quote, via Corcoran: There was this big discussion about how to put out Coloring Book: “What’s the best platform? Who is going to give us the most firepower?” I spoke with everyone — Spotify, Tidal, Apple Music, even Audiomack — and it came down to, “What is going to put us in the best position for the most people to hear it?” It’s telling that Corcoran poses that question, but doesn’t quite provide an answer. We’re led to believe that Apple Music was eventually determined to be the outlet putting the artist “in the best position for the most people to hear” the music, but that’s empirically dubious. Apple Music currently claims 15 million subscribers spanning 114 countries worldwide, and its exclusive content is available only to those 15 million subscribers. That’s a larger customer base than the one offered by Tidal (reportedly roughly 4 million subscribers), but a fraction of Spotify’s 100 million global users, and a tiny percentage of the world’s population (7.4 billion). We went over this at length when discussing the strange behavior driving Drake’s VIEWS, and I was admittedly pretty skeptical of the strategy and its alleged results. Now, it appears some major-label execs are also unconvinced. So they’re finally stepping in. According to industry analyst Bob Lefsetz’s newsletter (via The Guardian) today Universal Music Group CEO Lucian Grainge instructed all UMG-owned labels to stop arranging exclusivity agreements with streaming services. Writes The Guardian: UMG, which boasted seven of 2015’s 10 best-selling albums and 38.5% of the year’s recorded-music sales, will be the first major label to ban the practice, which many feel has begun to diminish rather than enhance the way music is distributed and consumed. The list of artists to whom this edict might apply is almost endless — I’m not even going to count down all the labels under the UMG umbrella because we ain’t got all day here. Of course, how this will play out in practice remains to be seen. The Guardian named Taylor Swift as one of the artists affected — and that would be delightful, considering how hard Swift has shilled for Apple over the past year — but Swift’s Big Machine Records is only distributed by UMG, and therefore, presumably isn’t subjected to Grainge’s directive. Forbes seems to confirm Lefsetz’s report’s accuracy. In an earlier email Lefsetz suggests that Frank Ocean’s Blonde was the tipping point here, because Ocean was signed to Def Jam, which is owned by UMG. However, that seems unlikely: According to The Fader, Ocean is no longer under contract with Def Jam, and Blonde was an independent release (per Pitchfork, Friday’s “visual album” Endless fulfilled the terms of Ocean’s agreement with the label, although a former Apple employee suggests otherwise). If Ocean’s deal with Def Jam extends beyond Blonde, though, then this is perhaps the last Ocean album that will get the “Apple exclusive” treatment. (This assumes Apple Music, on-demand streaming, and the internet itself still exist when Ocean’s next album is ready, sometime in the 2030s.) But maybe not? Even if Ocean is still affiliated with Def Jam yet somehow controls his own streaming rights, then Def Jam has no say over his decisions in that regard. Now, it’s pretty unlikely that Ocean would control his streaming rights if he were signed to a major, but Grainge’s hardline stance might backfire on him in other ways: Most notably, it might deter artists from signing with UMG, especially if they share Chance’s view that an Apple Music exclusive puts them in “best position for the most people to hear [them].” They’d be wrong, of course, but they might make a few bucks in exchange for a lot of ears. To be clear, I think Grainge is making a smart call, but I’m suspicious of his motives. UMG owns a significant stake in Spotify, and it stands to make a lot of money when the service goes public next year. The true test here will come after the IPO, when UMG has divested its shares. Because right now, Apple Music exclusives threaten to chip away at Spotify’s market appeal and eventual valuation, and by banning exclusives, Grainge is — whether by coincidence or design — protecting a very large payout that will be safely in his pocket very soon. And once it’s in his pocket, his priorities might shift. That’s not to say they will shift, and it is definitely not to say Apple Music exclusives will ever put any artist in the best position to achieve anything. They absolutely won’t; it’s insane to think they will. BUT if they can bring in some extra scratch for the labels after the labels have cashed out on Spotify? Well then Lucian Grainge might change his tune. That’s free money and none of it is owed to the artist! So it’s a positive development in the short term, but give it time. Wait for the dust to settle and the checks to clear. When all is said and done, that next Frank record might be locked in Apple’s garden after all.

WATCH: See how the oDocs product works here. The startup was awarded “Best Start Up - Social Impact” at the Talent Unleashed Awards in Sydney, as judged by a panel including Sir Richard Branson and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, who is currently in New Zealand. The awards recognise the very best in game-changing technology throughout Europe and the Asia-Pacific. “It’s fair to say we were a bit of an underdog,” says oDocs Co-Founder Dr Hong Sheng Chiong. “We were up against other winners like ResApp Health who’ve raised more than $13m, while we were sharing a hotel room to cut down on costs. We’re a lean operation.” Dr Chiong had to pitch to Wozniak and the panel at the awards to take out the top prize. “Steve Wozniak is the ultimate designer, engineer, maker and entrepreneur, so to earn his praise is incredibly gratifying.” “He’s also a humble guy to talk to and shared a lot of wisdom with us about the importance of working creatively and quickly to stay ahead of the pack. It’s a lesson we’ll take forward as we push on with our mission to prevent the millions of cases of preventable blindness every year.” Dr Chiong, oDocs CEO Hanna Eastvold-Edwins, and Design Director Alain Brideson will have plenty more time to pick Wozniak’s brains with the startup winning a trip to Silicon Valley and mentorship with “Woz” as part of the award. “He gave us one of his stainless steel business cards for the plane ride,” says Eastvold-Edwins. “Woz claims he uses them to cut his steaks when given plastic cutlery. It’s funny, but that shows his ability to look at things in ways most people don’t.” oDocs was founded in 2014 to make eye-care more accessible to all and ultimately help eliminate all cases of preventable blindness. “We’re passionate about preventing blindness; it’s the thing that drives us,” says Eastvold-Edwins. “The eye health industry needs a revolution because at the moment good care is far too cost-prohibitive. 285 million people around the world are blind and 80% of these cases were preventable or treatable, most of these in developing countries.” “We’ve packed $50,000 worth of optometry equipment into two iPhone attachments that we sell for less than $500 USD,” says Brideson. “Paired with our app, this is truly game-changing technology that can deliver world-class eye care to those who need it most and help us decentralise medical care.” And to make it even more accessible, oDocs commits half of all its net profits to saving eyesight in developing countries. oDocs is currently raising a seed round of $500,000 and is preparing to ship products to its first customers later this year.

As Pitchfork reports, Endless apparently fulfilled Frank’s contract with Def Jam and Universal, as the label can be seen in the credits for the album. But on Apple Music, you can see Blond is credited to Boys Don’t Cry, meaning Frank released it independently, unless he’s being bankrolled by another major label secretly with his own imprint. This comes as something of a shock, especially because Apple Music exclusives (What a Time to Be Alive, Views and Major Key, for instance) were all funneled through major labels. If Frank is truly indie now, it means he secured an Apple Music deal without even needing a major label. Perhaps his Three Six Zero management team and Apple Music’s Head of Content Larry Jackson had a talk. Surely Frank got a nice check from Apple for the two-week exclusive, but looking at his projections for first week sales, those royalties will come in handy too. As of now, he’s looking at a No. 1 spot with between 225 and 250,000 copies moved first week. 133 Rapper-Launched Record Labels From the Past and Present Image of Subscribe to XXL on Filed Under: Frank Ocean Category: News SHARE TWEET EMAIL REDDIT More Leave a comment EMAIL Print this page Pin it!

However, a newly discovered patent reveals technology that would use AR for navigation purposes without requiring a GPS or cellular connection to work. Also important is the fact that the patent practically confirms that Apple purchased Flyby Media. DON’T MISS: The iPhone 7 will obliterate the Galaxy Note 7 and every other smartphone Earlier this year, Apple was rumored to have purchased Flyby Media, a company that worked on AR solutions for products such as Google’s Project Tango. Apple Insider reports that Apple was granted a patent detailing an AR-based navigation technology, which marks the first invention to be reassigned from the Flyby Media acquisition. Called Visual-based inertial navigation, the patent lets a device position itself in a 3D space after interpreting data from the camera and sensors including the gyroscope, accelerometer, and others. Using images and taking several measurements, the device can determine its orientation and position in real time. A GPS or cell connection isn’t required to calculate a highly accurate location, down to centimeters. Interestingly, the patent does mention that "smart glasses" are the kind of products that could benefit from such technology alongside smartphones and tablets. Apple’s invention uses a technology called sliding window inverse filter (SWF) to minimize the computational overhead needed to combine data from multiple images and calculate a location. In other words, Apple wants to be able to tell you where you are located inside a building without using too many resources, including extra computing power and battery life, or hog the storage with locally saved images. The SWF technology process information from overlapping images as captured by the camera, and tracks the features in them in order for sensors to determine the device’s state, and then to locate the device’s position in a certain environment, including indoor locations. SWF could be used to support AR navigation on devices, or help users find lost objects or items in a store. Like with any Apple patent that surfaces online, it’s not guaranteed that the technology described will make it to future devices. What is interesting about the patent is that it shows Apple is taking AR very seriously. The full patent is available at the source link.

By Ben Dandridge-Lemco   Tyler Kaufman / Getty Images Universal Music Group - the music corporation that counts Def Jam, EMI, and more among its labels - is discontinuing exclusive releases to streaming services such as Apple Music, TIDAL, and Spotify, The Guardian reports. Lucian Grange, UMG's CEO, announced the streaming exclusive ban in a company-wide email on Tuesday, according to Bob Lefsetz, author of the music industry newsletter, The Lefsetz Letter. As reported Tuesday by The FADER, Frank Ocean is no longer signed to a recording contract with Def Jam, after he fulfilled the terms of his contract with the release of his Endless visual album as an Apple Music exclusive. The visual album would mark the company's last exclusive streaming release. The exclusive trend in streaming music has led to intense competition in the last year between Apple Music and Tidal. Both Beyoncé and Rihanna released their latest albums through TIDAL, where Jay Z is a part-owner. Apple Music has contracted exclusive releases from Chance the Rapper, Future, and Drake this year, and recently signed a deal with Birdman and Cash Money Records. In most cases, the music has remained exclusive to the respective streaming service for two-week periods, although TIDAL and Kanye West recently ran into legal trouble for advertising permanent TIDAL exclusivity of West's The Life of Pablo album. UMG released seven out of ten of the 2015's highest-selling albums, accounting for 38.5% of the year’s recorded-music sales. The company will be the first major label to ban the practice of streaming exclusives. Representatives for Universal Music Group, Apple, and TIDAL were not immediately available for comment.

Part of the reason Tekserve is closing shop? Apple stores — and the internet — are taking its business. “I’d say we had a good run,” said Tekserve founder and owner Dick Demenus. “But the world changed around us. Some of those forces were pretty insurmountable, like the internet.  Brick and mortar were challenged everywhere, and it finally hit us. People could buy things a lot cheaper online from places that have warehouses in a low-rent area.” One of Tekserve's vintage radios, up for auction. - Ben Johnson/Marketplace But the store isn't going before auctioning off its pretty massive collection of old radios, microphones, a human-sized blue robot, and lots of old Macs—some functional, and some not.  “It looks like a Salvador Dali,” Demenus said of one Macintosh for sale that was damaged in a fire before coming to Tekserve for data retrieval.  A Macintosh that was in a fire before going to Tekserve for data retrieval. - Ben Johnson/Marketplace “Partially melted, folding in on itself. I think it’s beautiful,” he said.  The auction begins at 11 am today, and it’s worth stopping by if you’re in the market for an old Mac or an old microphone (!), or just to get a sense of our technology history.  Follow Stephanie Hughes at @stephanie_h.  Stephanie Hughes Stephanie Hughes is the producer of Marketplace Tech, which examines the growing digital economy and looks at how technology is changing the work we do every day.

Your Right to Know Public records complaint program open for business By Kaitlin Fochesato The Columbus Dispatch  •  Tuesday August 23, 2016 6:35 PM A new resource for Ohio students will combine history and technology to provide a comprehensive look at the swing state's pivotal role in presidential elections. Secretary of State Jon Husted announced the launch of the resource, a new Apple iBook titled, "Ohio: Pathway to the Presidency," Tuesday morning. Jason LaMar, an administrator with the Digital Education and Institutional Services at Columbus State Community College, came up with the idea and partnered with the Secretary of State's office to promote the e-book. LaMar was named an Apple Distinguished Educator in 2015 and authored the e-book at no cost as a community outreach project. It was edited by the Ohio History Connection. The e-book is free for users to download it to their iPhone, iPad or other Apple device. No equivalent for other operating systems will be released. LaMar said the book uses audio, video and interactive maps to engage the reader. The first version of the e-book has three chapters: histories of the eight presidents from Ohio, information on how a president is elected and Ohio demographics. Todd Kleismit, director of community and government relations for the Ohio History Connection, said, "We often say, 'Ohio is a content-rich environment when it comes to history,' and this is a great example of that." Additional chapters are slated to be added to the e-book, one of which will be a look at the 2016 presidential race. The final chapter added will be a live feed of election night results in November. "I know oftentimes, history gets a bad rap of being boring, but this is not boring," Husted said. "If I had had this tool in high school, I'd have done a lot better and enjoyed it a lot more." kfochesato@dispatch.com @KaitFochesato Favorite Print Story Advertisement • Place an ad News Video More Videos Advertisement • Place an ad Explore Columbus Search Businesses Featured Businesses Loading...

The company has publicly accused Apple of anticompetitively favoring its own streaming services, giving third-party offerings like Spotify a disadvantage. Now, it appears that Apple Music is causing Spotify even more trouble, this time when it comes to negotiating with labels. As noted by MBW, Spotify has been out of contract with all three major music companies for a significant period of time due to disputes over revenue splits. According to the report, Spotify has been out of contract with Universal Music Group for over a year, while its contract with Warner Music Group expired in early 2016. Furthermore, Spotify’s agreement with Sony Music expired a few months back. For the end user, this hasn’t had any major effects yet. Currently, Spotify is still streaming content from all three labels with month-to-month contracts and it’s unlikely that any of the companies will abruptly pull their catalog from the service. What’s notable, however, is that Spotify’s relationship with labels is becoming more tense as the company looks to grow subscriber numbers with cheaper promo plans. It’s no secret that the launch of Apple Music has pressured Spotify into looking at other ways to grow its install base, including lower-priced streaming tiers. In fact, labels are reportedly uncomfortable with Spotify introducing promotion plans without having a secure deal in place, with one label executive describing it as a “very grey area.” It’s widely believed that Apple is paying publishers 13.5 percent to 15 percent of revenue, which is slightly lower than that of Spotify. Additionally, Apple pays record labels 58 percent of revenues, while Spotify pays 55 percent. With the contracts having run out, labels and publishers are now looking for Spotify to match those numbers. Spotify, however, struggles to do that with its current revenue numbers. In 2015, it posted a loss of $194 million on over $2 billion in revenue during 2015. According to today’s report, both Spotify and major labels remain “optimistic” about striking a new deal, despite Spotify’s wish to lower the percent paid out in royalties. Spotify’s lack of long-term deals with labels, however, comes as it is facing increasingly strong competition from Apple Music when it comes to securing exclusive rights to content. Apple Music currently is exclusively streaming Frank Ocean’s new album “Blond,” while the upcoming Britney Spears album “Glory” will also be an Apple Music exclusive. At WWDC earlier this year, Apple announced that its streaming music service has 15 million active paying users, which is half of the 30 million Spotify reports having. Nevertheless, it’s clear that the streaming music wars are heating up and that Apple’s increasingly large cash pile is helping its efforts and subsequently hurting Spotify’s. And it’s likely that Spotify won’t be afraid to voice any displeasure it has regarding Apple Music. And Apple won’t be afraid to reply.

Gliimpse’s story Started by Anil Sethi and Karthik Hariharan, Gliimpse was founded in 2013. Anil, a serial entrepreneur, has almost a decade of experience in the healthcare sector and had also worked with Apple during the late 1980s as a systems engineer.  Before starting up Gliimpse, Anil had also founded Xlipstream, Sequoia Software and Pinch Bio. Gliimpse was born of a personal need, shared Anil on his LinkedIn page. The platform focuses on patients who are battling diseases like cancer and diabetes. It provides a secure platform where consumers can manage and share their medical records and information with whomever they wish. Apple’s interest in the healthcare sector Notably, Apple recently roped in a paediatric endocrinologist who developed a HealthKit app for teens with Type 1 diabetes, signalling an increased interest in applications for chronically ill users. Additionally, the tech giant had also acquired healthcare startups, including HealthKit, CareKit and ResearchKit startups, which allow patients, doctors and researchers to access relevant health and wellness data.   Advertisement Advertisement The acquisition deal, which was closed earlier this year, was not disclosed, but has now been confirmed by the company. In a statement, the company said, "Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans." The acquisition affirms the tech giant’s keen interest in the healthcare sector. Recently, Apple also launched a HealthKit app that helps users monitor personal health and fitness data on the iPhone 6.   Apart from this, Apple recently also acquired technology startups, including VocalIQ, Perceptio and Emotient. Genee’s story Founded by Ben Cheung and Charles Lee, Genee was launched in 2014. Since then, the startup has been helping consumers by intelligent scheduling coordination and optimisation through artificial intelligence (AI), and chat bots. Charles Lee, in an official blog post, said, A new beginning means the end of another. The Genee service will shut down on September 1, 2016. While Genee will no longer send you useful reminders and agendas from your calendar, all existing calendar entries created by Genee will remain. We thank all of you who participated in Genee's private and public betas. Microsoft’s interest Acquired by Microsoft, Genee’s founders will now join Microsoft. Explaining how Genee’s platform will help Microsoft, Rakesh Jha, corporate Vice President of Microsoft said- “Say you want to meet a potential customer, Diana, for coffee. Simply send an email to Diana and copy Genee, like you would a personal assistant. Genee understands that you want to “Find a time to meet with Diana for coffee next week” and will streamline the process by emailing her directly with appropriate options that work with your calendar and preferences. Genee will even send out the meeting invite on your behalf– freeing up your time. A coffee meeting scheduled in a snap!” It is unclear whether the duct will be integrated with any of Microsoft's existing applications, but comments from the company suggest Genee's expertise could be used across Microsoft's Office 365 suite of products. Commenting on the acquisition Rakesh said that it will help in further enhancing new Office 365 productivity capabilities and improve the services, as well as bring intelligence into every digital experience. Major tech firms are focusing on bolstering the capabilities of their digital personal assistants. Genee's expertise could be used to improve the capabilities of Microsoft's Cortana, as it competes with the likes of Google Now and Apple's Siri. More Acquisitions On The Way Acquisitions have been a common phenomenon this year. Apart from the startup acquisitions in the indie scene, Yahoo’s acquisition by Verizon for $4.83 billion in cash, Linkedin’s acquisition by Microsoft, Oracle buying out Netsuite for $9.3 billion and Media.net’s recent acquisition, have been the major deals that have been in the news lately. With the ongoing funding crunch, more acquisition deals are likely to be closed in the near future. However, at such times, product-driven startups with viable business models will draw the attention of the ecosystem as well as entice investors.  If  you are an entrepreneur working on innovative product solutions then apply to Airbus BizLab accelerator. Applications closing shortly.

Business Business Columnists The Apple Store is now just Apple, and all retailers could learn from that Apple Store Anthony Souffle / Chicago Tribune Pedestrians walk past the Apple Store on North Michigan Ave. Pedestrians walk past the Apple Store on North Michigan Ave. (Anthony Souffle / Chicago Tribune) Phil RosenthalContact ReporterChicago Tribune The Apple Store is no longer the Apple Store. It now is just Apple, as in Apple Orland Square Mall or Apple Lincoln Park. This is subtle, but in no way trivial. It may be just one word, but taking Store out of the name is a statement about focus, purpose and expectations as surely as when Steve Jobs pared Apple Computer to just Apple about six months before the first iPhones were released to the public in 2007. Turning the Apple Store into the Apple store speaks to the role the tech powerhouse envisions for its public outposts and, if it's right, could lend other traditional retailers such as Macy's a potential survival guide for an increasingly e-commerce future. Make no mistake: Apple is still selling, always. But the buying? That can be done anywhere and anytime, and this is an acknowledgment of that. A store isn't necessary to transact business, so that may not be its primary purpose. The name change coincides with the opening of retail spaces newly designed to be hangouts for consumers as much as anything else, which makes sense. If the only time most people come to the Apple store is to buy merchandise, get it repaired or even check out the latest products, it's not a very effective use of real estate. But using these places as virtual Apple clubhouses, strengthening existing bonds with devotees and welcoming newcomers into an inviting, immersive experience, you're selling Apple and its products with or without immediate transactions. How do you like those Apples? Waning wow factor for iPhone a drag for Cook Phil Rosenthal Remember when people were in awe of the Apple iPhone and the other smartphones that followed its lead?

Remember when people were in awe of the Apple iPhone and the other smartphones that followed its lead? After nine years or so and about 1 billion iPhones sold, no one gets that excited anymore. What affection there is for the iPhone and Apple — which looks to the handsets for about two dollars... (Phil Rosenthal) Visitors learn about what Apple offers, how to make the best use of it and, if they do nothing but relax a bit and check email, they come away with a good experience to associate with the company. Not every store will have trees around in the area where its team of troubleshooters work, as found at Apple Union Square, which opened earlier this year in San Francisco. But Apple World Trade Center opened last week in New York with a bit of greenery, and is said to give off a similar vibe. The 20,000-square-foot Apple space now under construction at Pioneer Court on North Michigan Avenue holds the same promise with its river exposure. The new Apple location in Manhattan is just one of the attractions in the Oculus, the $3.9 billion Santiago Calatrava-designed structure at the World Trade Center's transportation hub connecting commuter trains and subways. As such, it's showy space in a showy space. The shopping area is managed by Australia's Westfield, a mall operator that has had to adjust to changing consumer habits. It has benefited from becoming less reliant on retail stores to be the draws they once were. While restaurant, cineplex and other nonshopping components accounted for less than 10 percent of Westfield malls' floor space in 1990, The Economist recently noted leisure uses now take up one-third or more of the company's big new projects. Not all sellers are in the doldrums. Bargain hunters have helped outlet malls and warehouse clubs, but old-school brick-and-mortar retailers can't count on the old tricks to draw a crowd and open wallets. Discounts and selection can be matched online and then some, and online merchants are coming up with faster and cheaper delivery. Amazon, according to a recent Geek Wire report, is poised to open a pickup facility for its online grocery shoppers in Seattle, and the implications of that are considerable should it prove effective. That Amazon recognizes the potential value in establishing a physical presence should reassure everyone that there's a place for physical retail outlets going forward. But the only way to make a lease and team of employees pay is if the brick-and-mortar outlets do something for themselves and the public that can't be done as well digitally. That might involve buying stuff. It's also allowing someone to play with the merchandise, strong and engaged customer service, education on how best to use what's being sold, or just being a good brand ambassador by offering a place to sit with strong Wi-Fi. So Apple declaring a store isn't a store is no mere word game. It's a game plan. philrosenthal@chicagotribune.com Twitter @phil_rosenthal Copyright © 2016, Chicago Tribune Oh sure, it's easy now to say fears were overblown in Rio On Target, toilets, $20 million and keeping a brand out of the tank Want a ride?

By T.S. Fox · Aug 23, 2016 in Music  ·   Comments Shares http://hypebeast.com/2016/8/universal-streaming-ban-frank-ocean-blonde-apple-music?utm_source=link&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=share+buttons Blonde could very well be ushering in the end of an era: Universal Music Group — the parent company of Def Jam, which put out Frank Ocean’s highly anticipated LP — is reportedly banning its artists from signing exclusive deals with streaming platforms (a la the Apple Music and iTunes release of Blonde). According to industry insider Bob Lefsetz of The Lefsetz Letter fame, UMG CEO Lucian Grainge — who’s widely considered to be the most powerful executive in the entire music industry — sent out a company-wide email yesterday informing everyone of the new policy and its ban on the practice of exclusive distribution deals. If the move is indeed happening, it would be unprecedented as Universal would become the first label to throw exclusive deals out the window. So why exactly would Grainge want to make the change? As The Guardian points out, UMG was home to seven of the top 10 best-selling albums of 2015 — including the likes of Taylor Swift’s 1989 (like Blonde, an Apple exclusive upon release), Drake’s If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late, Justin Bieber’s Purpose and The Weeknd’s Beauty Behind the Madness — and boasted 38.5% of the year’s recorded music sales overall. Though exclusive deals like Ocean’s and Swift’s undoubtedly helped drive their respective album sales (and line the pockets of the artists in the process), it stands to reason that those sales would have been even higher had other platforms and retailers had an opportunity to stream and sell the releases as well. And, of course, more sales means even more profits for UMG. As The Guardian puts it, “the ultra-hyped Frank Ocean release coming exclusively through Apple, coupled with a deal announced earlier this month between Apple and Cash Money Records, whose artists include Lil Wayne, Nicki Minaj and Birdman, appears to have been sufficient to provoke label executives to action.” In his latest newsletter, Lefsetz touches on exclusive distribution deals and how they’re “anti-competitive and ultimately” harm both “the consumer and the artist.” He even goes so far as to say the United States government should investigate Apple Music — who just so happens to be led by former UMG head honcho Jimmy Iovine — with regards to antitrust concerns “because there’s a conspiracy between Apple Music and the industry to change the game, to get everybody to pay for a subscription by putting hit content behind a paywall.” He doesn’t just hold Apple accountable, though: Lefsetz says the artists are as much to blame as anyone. Writing about Ocean, Lefsetz says: Shame on you Frank, and shame on everybody else who takes money from Apple and screws fans. There’s enough money in music without taking every last buck, and the joke is on you, for thinking so short term, you want your music available to everybody, because in these days of information overload we need nobody, everybody is superfluous, you don’t want to enter the marketplace with one hand tied behind your back. Ultimately, only time will tell if UMG’s reported move sets off a domino effect that changes the way music is currently consumed. Until then, exclusivity will continue to be one of the main points of leverage a streaming platform or retailer has over its competition. Do you think an end to exclusive distribution deals would be a positive or negative? How would it change streaming and sales going forward? Sound of below and head on over to Lefsetz’s website to read his latest newsletter in its entirety.

Even if you’re not a college student, you’re probably aware that this is the time of year that many companies host back to school sales for incoming students – and these deals typically aren’t just for students. Anybody can take advantage of them. A hot product that has surfaced recently are hybrid devices – that is, devices that can act as a tablet or as a laptop. Three of the most popular hybrid devices on the market (Surface Pro, Surface Book, and iPad Pro) are created by two of the biggest manufacturers in the industry, Microsoft and Apple. While there are numerous other hybrid devices on the market, these three are unquestionably the most recognizable among them. I’m a student, and this year some of my classes are hosted online. I decided that I wanted to invest in a hybrid of my own, and I eventually narrowed it down to the Surface Book, Surface Pro, and the iPad Pro. However, making a final decision wasn’t easy. Sifting through countless articles and reviews and visiting demo stations several times ended up helping very little when it came time to actually purchase a device. Eventually, it had to be done, and I finally made a decision based on a very non-technical list of reasons why I should or shouldn’t buy a certain product. iPad Pro I really wanted the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. I have an iPad Air, and the 9.7-inch display is, in my opinion, the absolute perfect size for a tablet. Even if you went with the larger 12.9-inch variant, the iPad Pro is light and portable, has True Tone display (9.7-inch display only), four stereo speakers, and it’s compatible with Apple Pencil, which is widely regarded as one of the most accurate digitizers in the industry at the moment. The iPad Pro is also excellent for people who are already invested in an Apple ecosystem. If you already own an iPhone or a MacBook and are just looking for something smaller to take around for jotting down notes to edit later on a Mac or PC, then the iPad Pro works really well. Ultimately, the iPad Pro works better as a tablet than it does a laptop, although it does have some laptop-like features if you opt to purchase the Smart Keyboard along with it. If you plan on using apps over full-fledged software applications that you’d find on a laptop, then the iPad Pro might be the perfect solution for you. It’s also worth mentioning that Apple has some excellent battery management in its iPads. I’m still amazed at how long my iPad Air lasts between charges, and the device is 3 years old. However, since I wasn’t really invested in the Apple ecosystem and needed something more robust than iOS for school and work, I had to cross the iPad Pro off of my list. Surface Pro 4 In my head, the next logical step was to consider the Surface Pro. The Surface Pro is similar to the iPad Pro in form, but a bulkier, larger (12.9-inch display, which is also an option for the larger iPad Pro) and not as keen on battery life; but where it lacks in battery life, it makes up for in its overall ability to do more with Windows 10. There are a lot of spec options for the Surface Pro, depending on how powerful of a machine you’re looking to get. The Surface Pro comes with the Surface Pen, which sort of makes the price increase from the base 9.7-inch iPad Pro ($599) to the base Surface Pro 4 ($899) a little more justifiable. The base model of the Surface Pro 4 also comes with 128GB of storage (with option to expand via microSD) over the iPad Pro’s 32GB base. Even if you were to buy the next tier iPad Pro with 128GB of internal storage, if you purchased the Smart Keyboard and Apple Pencil along with it, the price is almost identical to a base Surface Pro 4 with Type Cover ($1,019.97 for the iPad Pro 9.7, Pencil, and Cover; $1029.98 for the Surface Pro and Cover). Still, the Surface Pro 4 can get pretty pricey if you find that you need more power. Great battery life isn’t really something the Pro 4 is known for, either, so expect to invest in a power bank of sorts if you don’t think you’ll be near an outlet very often. Finally, much like the iPad Pro, the Surface Pro 4 is intended for those who would use it as a tablet more than a laptop. However, I’d argue that the Surface Pro 4 is much more efficient at being a hybrid that the iPad Pro is, given that the iPad Pro runs on iOS and not OS X. The Surface Pro 4 runs on a full version of Windows 10.   But I still wasn’t satisfied. What I wanted was a laptop first, tablet second, and a device with decent battery life. This is where the Surface Book comes in. Surface Book The Surface Book was looking to be the best option for me. It had all of the components of a Surface Pro 4, but had better battery life (in laptop form, not tablet; there is a battery in the keyboard base and also with the display, but the display’s battery is much smaller, but I hardly ever use it when it isn’t connected to the base anyway). It also includes both the keyboard base and the Surface Pen; with the Surface Pro 4, you have to purchase the Surface Keyboard separately if you want it. Overall, I chose the Surface Book because it is a laptop first, tablet second, which was exactly what I needed. I also think I ended up getting a decent deal with the Surface Book. Students can get a good deal on a Surface Book/Pro and Xbox bundle, plus an extra 10% off the $150 discount Microsoft already has. It still ends up being more expensive than an iPad Pro, but for me it was worth it because I already know that I’d have more use for PC software than I would apps. I’m also grateful for expandable storage. So, overall, here’s what I deduced when it came to choosing between the three: Apple’s iPad Pro works best if you: Want a tablet with the option of using first-party keyboard. Are invested or plan to invest in the Apple ecosystem. Want a tablet with a good active digitizer for less money. Value great battery life. Prefer apps. Microsoft’s Surface Pro 4 works best if you: Want equal parts tablet and laptop functionality. Want included stylus. Want the option to use a mouse. Need USB ports. Have a need for PC software, but not a wide array of apps. Would like to have expandable storage. Want options for a more powerful device. Microsoft Surface Book works best if you: Want more laptop functionality than tablet. Want the option to use a mouse. Need USB ports. Would like to have expandable storage. Want a hybrid that includes a keyboard and a stylus. Need more power (including dedicated GPU in some models). Decent battery life. So that’s how I ended up deciding which hybrid worked best for me. Definitely not the most technical decision-making, but I’ve never really been the most technical person. To compare specifications, you can find specs for the iPad Pro models here for both the 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch models. Surface Pro 4 models can be viewed here, and Surface Book models here. In addition, there’s no reason not to consider the Surface Pro 3 as well if you’d rather save some money rather than having the latest model.   Readers, have you purchased a hybrid device recently?

Apple was the most sold stock in the second quarter by the largest hedge funds, primarily due to activist investor Carl Icahn's public exit from the stock. But Apple wasn't the only large stock that smart money dumped as it continued to flee equities last quarter. The top 10 hedge funds had aggregated equity holdings of $150 billion at quarter's end, up from $141 billion in the first quarter, while the total number of stock positions held by all 10 hedge fund managers fell to 399 from 408, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of McGraw Hill Financial, in its quarterly hedge fund tracker. The report analyzed Securities and Exchange Commission 13F filings by the 10 largest hedge funds by asset size to spotlight big buying and selling trends. Besides Apple, the technology and health care sectors overall had the biggest net sells from the top hedge funds, while stocks in the consumer discretionary sector were the most bought in the three months ending June 30, while the report said. The quarter saw buying in six of the 10 S&P sectors compared with net selling in nine of the 10 sectors in the first quarter. Apple is a holding in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS charitable portfolio. The smart money warmed up to Charter Communications . The cable service provider was the most-bought stock by the 10 largest hedge funds, including Third Point, Tiger Global Management, Glenview Capital Management and Lone Pine Capital. Check out the other most-sold stocks last quarter. 1. JD.com© Provided by Thestreet.com Market Cap: $37.1 billion Who Sold?: Lone Pine Capital Stephen Mandel's Lone Pine Capital sold all 22 million shares -- exiting its position -- of JD.com in the second quarter. Notably, Viking Global increased its position in the Chinese e-commerce site by 7.4 million shares. At quarter's end, Viking Global owned 22.5 million shares, which would have a present value of $580 million if still owned, according to Bloomberg. Also of note, Tiger Global owns roughly 44 million shares, or 3.8%, of JD.com, which did not change last quarter. The present value of that stake would be $1.13 billion, according to Bloomberg. The stock is down more than 20% this year. Click ahead to see more stocks sold. © PA Wire General view of Motorola's Basingstoke offices in Hampshire 2.

Anthem Market Cap: $34.1 billion Who Sold?: Viking Global Investors Viking Global Investors sold out of its entire position -- 4.8 million shares -- in Anthem during the second quarter.

The 18 million-share stake was valued at $1.8 billion at the end of the first quarter, according to Yahoo! Finance. Viking Global Investors also shaved its Netflix stake. The hedge fund sold off 1.7 million shares. At quarter's end, Viking Global still owned 6.3 million shares of the streaming service company. Viking Global's stake would be worth $600 million at present value. The stock is down approximately 16.7% this year. © Provided by Thestreet.com 5. Apple Market Cap: $585 billion Who Sold?: Icahn Capital, Tiger Global Management Apple was the most-sold stock in the quarter. Activist investor Carl Icahn sold his entire stake -- 45.7 million shares -- of the iPhone-maker's stock in April, he announced. Apple is a holding in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS charitable portfolio. In August 2013, Icahn was very public about his purchase of Apple shares. He took to Twitter to disclose his stake. "We currently have a large position in APPLE," he wrote. "We believe the company to be extremely undervalued. Spoke to Tim Cook today. More to come." Tiger Global also slashed its stake in Apple. The hedge fund sold 4.3 million shares of Apple. It still owns 1.4 million shares, valued presently at $150 million. Apple shares are up 3.1% this year.

Share this post 12 Ways the Galaxy Note 7 Beats the iPhone Posted on August 23, 2016 in Business Share Share Tweet4 Pin Stumble August 2016 may go down in history as the day Apple began to lose the smartphone wars. For the best part of a decade Apple has been smug in the knowledge that their handsets were just a cut above the rest. No more. With the launch of the Galaxy Note 7 this week; Apple is now firmly on the back foot. Here are 12 ways that the Galaxy Note 7 beats the iPhone: The Iris Scanner Fingerprint scanning just became old hat. It’s never been the best way to open a phone – slide your finger on the case; it’s just so… manual. With the Galaxy Note 7 there’s a built in Iris scanner and you can now open the open the phone with just a glance. That’s the kind of technological jump that we all love and early adopters will enjoy thrilling their friends with as they show off their new buy. The S Pen The S Pen has had a few ups and downs along the way but this generation appears to be just right. The large comfortable pen shaped stylus makes drawing on the screen incredibly easy. It’s perfect for doodling in a boring meeting or for designer’s to use as an impromptu sketching tool when their graphics pads are out of reach. Virtual-Reality Samsung has partnered with Oculus Rift and that means your new phone is perfect for viewing and accessing virtual-reality content on. What’s more because Oculus is the premier name in VR, for the moment at least, it means you’ll get access to the widest amount of VR content too. If you want to make use of this facility – you’ll need to buy a Gear VR headset (approx. $99 on top of the cost of the phone). Best in Class Camera The camera used in the Note 7 is widely considered to be the best-in-class camera for all smartphones. That simply means that it takes better photos than the Apple phone does. Given how important smartphone photography has become in recent years – that’s a big deal and a great reason for Apple users to make the switch to the Note 7. It’s Water Resistant Water resistance is a big deal when you buy an expensive handset. Why? Because so many people end up dropping them in puddles or even in the lavatory. Many smartphones are water-resistant in that they can take a little splash with a few drops of water but the Galaxy Note 7 can be fully submerged in water and survive for up to half an hour! The Big Screen and Small Footprint The iPhone 6 Plus has a big screen but the Note 7’s is bigger. Bigger doesn’t always mean better when it comes to handsets, after all it increases the size of the phone doesn’t it? Not this time round. The Note 7 has a bigger screen but a smaller overall footprint that the iPhone 6 Plus. You’ll find it goes in your pocket easier and is just a little easier to keep hold of too. Low Cost Wireless Charging The beauty of the Android ecosystem is that you’re not usually locked in to a manufacturer’s set of accessories. That’s the case with Galaxy Note 7 too and that means you can hook up the phone to any wireless charging pad (and not just Samsung’s) to get your battery charged without breaking the bank on a charger. Extra Performance Charging If you want faster charging you can always plug the Galaxy Note 7 into the wall or alternatively; you can go wild and buy Samsung’s wireless charger. Fully optimized for working with the Galaxy Note 7 it offers a small but significant performance boost over the generic wireless chargers. Security and Privacy One nice touch with the Galaxy Note 7 is that Samsung has recognized that there may be content on your phone that you don’t want to share with everyone. To make that easy for you – they’ve supplied a secure folder which can be unlocked through the iris scanner or using a touch screen passcode. Use Whatever Headphones You Like The current range of iPhones have a headphone jack in recognition of the fact that some people like to listen to music on their phones without paying a small fortune for wireless headphones. Sadly, when the iPhone 7 launches – it won’t have a headphone jack. The Samsung Note 7 does and that means even on the minor details; the Samsung is simply a better phone than the new Apple. SD Card Expansion The Galaxy Note 7 has an SD card slot and that means you can boost its already impressive storage capacity easily and cheaply. The onboard support is for up to a 256GB SD card and if that weren’t quite enough – during the launch phase of the Galaxy; they’ll be putting a free 256GB SD card in the box. So not only can you upgrade the phone but you can do it for no additional investment. Heart Rate Sensor The heart rate sensor on the back of the Samsung phone is kind of handy; sure it’s not going to sway many users between the two eco-systems but Samsung has one and Apple doesn’t and it’s another little benefit that may be of use in the long-term. Summary The design team at Samsung can feel justly proud of the Galaxy Note 7. It’s a genuine game changer and one where for the first time ever – Samsung’s ability to innovate has exceeded Apple’s. With no major changes anticipated in the iPhone 7; Samsung can rest, temporarily, on its laurels knowing it has the best smartphone on the market today.   Share Share Tweet4 Pin Stumble Previous Post: The 10 Worst Things Businesses Do Next Post: 10 Great Ways to Rapidly Improve Your Credit Score <a href="http://ox-d.popcrunch.com/w/1.0/rc?cs=524c24a9265ef&cb=<?php echo $random_number; ?>" ><img src="http://ox-d.popcrunch.com/w/1.0/ai?auid=183519&cs=524c24a9265ef&cb=<?php echo $random_number; ?>" border="0" alt=""></a> Popular Posts 12 Practical Business Lessons From Social Psychology - 323K Total Shares The 50 Best Mind Hacks on the Web - 250K Total Shares 15 Weird and Mysterious Books - 143K Total Shares 10 Body Language Techniques to Make You Succeed in Business - 138K Total Shares 25 Most Promising Green Businesses - 97K Total Shares 10 Accidental Discoveries That Generated Great Wealth - 96K Total Shares 10 richest criminals of all time - 91K Total Shares 20 Animals That Have Been Cloned - 86K Total Shares 10 Most Profitable Sexual Enhancers - 59K Total Shares 10 Halloween Costumes that will Make Your Wallet Scream in Terror - 56K Total Shares <a href="http://ox-d.popcrunch.com/w/1.0/rc?cs=524c24a9265ef&cb=<?php echo $random_number; ?>" ><img src="http://ox-d.popcrunch.com/w/1.0/ai?auid=183519&cs=524c24a9265ef&cb=<?php echo $random_number; ?>" border="0" alt=""></a> Recent Posts How to Have Better Business Meetings How to Keep Your Employees Happy Without Giving Them a Raise Content Marketing Sins and How to Avoid Them Draw: The Best Free to Use Flowchart Software for Small Businesses in 2016 Lucidchart: The Best Value Flowchart Software for Small Businesses in 2016 Visio: The Best Flowchart Software for Small Businesses in 2016 10 Facebook Marketing Mistakes and How to Avoid Them For Your Business Zoho Books Review: The Best Accounting Software for the Smallest Businesses 51 Ways to Define Leadership GetResponse Review: The Best Budget E-mail Marketing Software for Small Businesses <a href="http://ox-d.popcrunch.com/w/1.0/rc?cs=524c24a9265ef&cb=<?php echo $random_number; ?>" ><img src="http://ox-d.popcrunch.com/w/1.0/ai?auid=183519&cs=524c24a9265ef&cb=<?php echo $random_number; ?>" border="0" alt=""></a> Design & Development by Best Online Universities Back To Top

Bishop’s Orchards Farm Market was named Best of the Shoreline in two categories: Pies and Apple Cider Six generations have contributed to the growth of Bishop’s from a roadside stand to a local market known for its apples, cider and fresh produce, to a full service grocery, where a visit can feed a family from appetizers to dessert. Stop by there before any major holiday and the parking lot will be overflowing with cars and the store and grounds all decked out with seasonal decorations. You’ll be sure to run into your neighbors and out-of-town friends, but you may also run into celebrities such as American Idol winner Nick Fradiani, Jr., who grew up in Guilford. In honor of his visit this spring, Bishop’s created a special ice cream, “Fradiani Frenzy” based on his two favorite flavors, chocolate and peanut butter. Back in 2013, legendary and now retired Yankee closer Mariano Riviera — a day after being honored for his career achievements at Yankee Stadium — brought his family to the landmark farm to pick apples and shop in the market. He was spotted carrying gallons of apple cider. Muffins, cookies, cider donuts, and breads aside, Bishop’s pies are legendary. Apple, of course, as well as various other fruit pies are de rigueur for holiday meals. Half pies are available for modest appetites as well as frozen ones that can be popped in the oven without the elusive task of rolling out the perfect piecrust. With the expansion of the market a few years ago, the bakery has grown to accommodate all kinds of baked delights. Bishop’s is synonymous with locally produced sweet apple cider. They’ve been making it since the 1930s on site from apples grown in their own orchards. It’s a carefully controlled process that ensures perfect cider from September until June or later. Bishop’s expertise in cider making has been incorporated into the hard cider that’s become a part of its award-winning winery headed up by Keith Bishop. More than 179 medals have been earned since the winery was opened in 2005. The wine bar, located in the 1928 barn section of the market, is open for tastings seven days a week. The growing season is reflected in the Pick Your Own schedule, which runs from strawberries in June to pumpkins in September and October. Recent expansions have also introduced an outstanding selection of meats and poultry and prepared foods, soups and entrees. Pies, produce, and cider just scratch the surface of Bishop’s bounty. Come for family fun and leave with a cartload of healthy, delicious food that will sustain you.

 It's going to be a lot easier to find a new big-screen iPhone to buy when it comes out Kif Leswing Aug. 23, 2016, 2:39 PM 12,590 facebook linkedin twitter email print Getty When the iPhone 6 first came out in 2014, there were significant shortages of the bigger model with a 5.5-inch screen. Demand simply outstripped supply. This fall, when the iPhone 7 comes out, don't expect the same crunch and month-long wait times. According to Credit Suisse analyst Pauline Chen, who cites supply chain research, Apple will make a larger proportion of iPhone 7 Plus compared to the standard-size iPhone than it has for the past two years, which has hovered around 30%.  The bigger iPhone coming out next month will be more technologically advanced than the smaller model. (It's also going to be $100 more expensive.) It's expected to have a camera with two lenses, which means it will be able to zoom, and it can produce brighter, more detailed photos, according to Bloomberg. Chen writes:  "We expect 5.5" to account for a bigger portion in the [holiday quarter] ... We think Apple has incentive to maximize the volume of its premium model (5.5"), given its recent results (iPhone blended ASP down 10% YoY), Samsung's success in the premium GS7 Edge model (accounting for half of total S7 volume, according to IDC), and the much stronger July sales growth by Largan/Flexium (up 28% MoM, vs iPhone supply chain up 10-15% MoM). As a result, we expect the new 5.5" model (with dual camera) to account for 35-40% of new models' volumes in 4Q16E (assuming there are no longer supply constraints)." There's one caveat: the supplier selling the dual camera module to Apple might not be able to make enough to meet Apple's order. Apple is expected to launch two new iPhones next month at an event in the Bay Area, along with new Apple Watches and MacBook laptops.  But the iPhone is Apple's moneymaker, accounting for about 70% of its earnings, and its reception will be closely watched, especially since iPhone sales have dropped on an annual basis for the past two quarters.  Analysts and rumormongers expect devices similar to last year's models, with a few key improvements:  A re-engineered home button that uses motors to simulate a click. Significantly improved waterproofing. Upgraded hardware and components. No headphone jack — Apple will include earbuds that plug in through the Lightning charging port or a dongle instead.  It will probably look like the phone depicted below on the right: tech.infeng SEE ALSO: Get ready — here's when the iPhone 7 will probably come out NOW WATCH: This hidden iPhone feature will boost your reception Loading video...

The firm is working on a music subscription service that would only work on its Echo hardware, tech news website Recode reported, citing sources. Amazon would like to launch the services in September, but has not finalized deals with major music labels and publishers, Recode reported. Scroll down for video  Amazon would like to launch the services in September, but has not finalized deals with major music labels and publishers, Recode reported. Amazon was preparing to launch a standalone music streaming subscription service at $9.99 per month, in line with major rivals, Reuters reported in June, citing sources. The Recode report said one sticking point, sources say, is whether Amazon will sell the cheaper service for $4 or $5 a month.

Earlier this year music streaming service Spotify claimed Apple is attempting to block competition for Apple Music by refusing to approve a new version of the app.  Amazon launched the Echo — an internet-connected speaker powered by Alexa, the company’s AI software — last year, and reportedly sold a million units. HOW THE STREAMING SERVICES COMPARE Service  Cost  Apple Music  $9.99 a month or $14.99 for a family plan (up to six family members) - both with a three-month free trial (£9.99 and £14.99 in UK) Tidal $9.95-a-month for standard sound quality and $19.99-a-month for 'lossless high fidelity sound quality' (£9.99 and £19.99 in the UK) Spotify   Free level with adverts, Premium $9.99-a-month service (£9.99 in the UK) Beats Music   $9.99-a-month or $99 per year Pandora  $4.99-a-month for Pandora's ad-free internet radio service Deezer  Free with adverts, $9.99-a-month for Premium+ (£9.99 in the UK) Rdio  Free with adverts, Rdio Unlimited costs $9.99 (£9.99 in the UK) and US users can also get Rdio Select for $3.99 a month with limited downloads  It has added hundreds of new features to the sevice,  and the e-commerce giant envisions its voice assistant functioning like the 'Star Trek computer', in that it will answer users no matter where they are in their home with instant feedback. And, more than 10,000 developers have registered to add the virtual assistant to products, bringing this dream closer to a reality. Since Amazon has outsourced Alexa, more than 10,000 developers have registered to build more innovated skills for the virtual assistant. And the firm boasts that this group has grown Alexa's skills to over 1,400. Since the beginning of 2016, Alexa's smart home API skills selection has increased by more than 5 times. Amazon wants Alexa to boldly go where no AI has gone before. David Limp, Amazon's senior vice president for devices, envisions the voice assistant functioning like the 'Star Trek computer', in that it will answer users no matter where they are in their home and right away  'We are thrilled that tens of thousands of developers are already building skills for Alexa, helping to grow our Alexa skill selection by 50% in just over a month,' said Steve Rabuchin, Vice President, Amazon Alexa. 'We're excited to introduce new features that make it even easier for customers to discover those skills.' Spotify's general counsel, Horacio Gutierrez, sent a letter to Apple on 26 June, saying Apple is 'causing grave harm to Spotify and its customers', according to Recode.  The letter says Apple turned down a new version of the app while citing 'business model rules' and demanded Spotify use Apple's billing system if 'Spotify wants to use the app to acquire new customers and sell subscriptions.' Apple's Eddy Cue unveiled the major overhaul of Apple Music at the firm's WWDC in San Francisco earlier this month, which came after repeated complaints from customers over the streaming service Apple launched Apple Music, its own music service, in June 2015. For the past year, Spotify has argued publicly that Apple's subscription policies punish third-party music services that use Apple's platform, in favour of Apple Music.   Read more: Amazon wants to sell a cheaper music subscription service that will only work on its Echo player - Recode Share or comment on this article e-mail 17 shares Most watched News videos Gruesome moment Korean chef dissects a LIVE octopus Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Teen films a burning 'meteorite' moving across sky in Japan Shocking moment man hits women in mass chicken shop fight Supermodel Gigi Hadid fights off man who grabs her at Milan show Tidal surge filmed on Sunaoshi River in Tagajo, Japan The moment a 7.4 magnitude earthquake hit Fukushima Kim Kardashian attacked in Paris by notorious prankster Mystery homeless woman in Rome avoids questions from reporter Cyclist films moment car causes him to crash then drives away 100 special police agents protect suspected paedophile from mob Doorman knocks-out troublemaker during two-on-one confrontation Six rebel electors have signed an agreement to try to block...

Lizette Chapman @lizette_chapman More stories by Lizette Chapman August 23, 2016 — 1:54 PM EDT August 23, 2016 — 1:54 PM EDT Venture capitalists are now the ones making a pitch. As both major presidential candidates promote U.S. tax policies aimed at ending special tax treatment for investment managers' income, Silicon Valley is girding itself for potential reforms. Venture investors, facing the possibility of bigger tax bills, are trying to convince Washington that they’re special and should be exempt. At issue is a decades-old tax rule on carried interest, which is the share of profit awarded to fund managers when selling their stakes, or when companies are acquired or go public. Investment managers say that paying them in carried interest ties their compensation to the performance of long-term, often riskier, investments. Under current law, their carried-interest income qualifies for being taxed as capital gains at a rate as low as 23.8 percent, compared with the top individual income-tax rate of 43.4 percent on ordinary income. During their campaigns, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have each singled out carried interest, calling it a tax loophole benefiting the rich. It’s likely to be a topic of conversation on Wednesday among attendees at a Clinton fundraiser in Silicon Valley hosted by Apple Inc. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook. “Outside of this being a populist topic, it doesn’t make any sense,” said Peter Barris, a managing general partner at New Enterprise Associates who has been at the VC firm for more than two decades. “We are playing around with the golden egg.” VCs will spend the next few months making their case to Washington for why they shouldn’t be lumped together with hedge funds, private equity, and real estate investors. They will argue that higher taxes would lead to a VC brain drain, deter new funds from forming, and discourage risk taking. In other words, the tax proposals threaten American innovation. For a Quick Take on carried interest, click here. Carried interest has periodically been a target of scrutiny for at least a decade. It was a flash point during the Occupy Wall Street movement and dogged Mitt Romney, co-founder of private-equity firm Bain Capital, during his failed 2012 presidential run. Over the past decade, some members of Congress have proposed treating carried interest as regular income for tax purposes, but those measure have failed. In this election cycle, carried interest has become calcified in a larger economic debate. “It’s become the poster child for inequality,” said Matt Gardner, executive director at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a think tank in Washington. “When you see these tax breaks that aren’t available to the general population of wage earners, it erodes the public's faith in the tax system and in Congress.” Gardner said eliminating carried interest tax benefits could generate an estimated $25 billion over 10 years. He said the amount is small, but it would be a huge symbolic gesture. And wealthy VCs will have a difficult time convincing the public that they should get a pass: “They all argue they are special.” The VCs can mount a pretty convincing defense. They’ve helped transform novel business ideas into some of the world’s most valuable companies, including Apple, Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Facebook Inc., and Microsoft Corp. According to a 2015 study by Stanford University, 43 percent of public U.S. companies founded since 1979 had raised venture cash. Venture capitalists argue that tax incentives encourage them to prioritize a startup’s long-term success over quick gains. They typically work with their companies for seven to 10 years before seeing a return. Because 4 of every 5 startups fails, investors said they bank on meteoric hits—and the accompanying tax benefits—to make up for losses. As much as 60 percent of a venture investor’s compensation can comes from carried interest, according to the National Venture Capital Association, a U.S. lobbying and trade group. “It’s basically doubling our tax rate,” said Venky Ganesan, the organization’s chairman. Hiking taxes could make investing a less attractive career for those with high-paying jobs at tech companies, where many VCs come from, he said. The elimination of the carried interest provision would reduce the number of new funds and push the industry to make safer investments in more mature companies instead of gambling on areas such as medicine and clean technology, he said. Not all VCs are panicking. Fred Wilson, co-founder of Union Square Ventures, has expressed support for taxing carried interest as ordinary income. Sam Altman, the president of business incubator Y Combinator, said in December that it’s “ridiculous” for VCs to pay a lower rate on their returns than Americans do on their salaries.

The industry was excluded from the 2010 Dodd-Frank law, partly because Americans have a greater understanding of the unique value VC funding provides to the economy, he said. “Eliminating carried interest deductions for VCs either shows an ignorance of the issues, or it means you are truly anti-entrepreneur,” Schlein said. “It’s a much more nuanced topic than politicians give it credit for.” Fighting to keep the carried interest provision risks creating a bigger problem. Appealing for special treatment could make Silicon Valley financiers appear greedy and out of touch, putting their reputations at risk. Tom Perkins, the late co-founder of Kleiner Perkins, wrote a 2014 op-ed in the Wall Street Journal comparing the treatment of rich Americans with the persecution of Jews in Nazi Germany. The article was thoroughly ridiculed and quickly disavowed by other VCs, including those at his own firm. Perkins later defended his comments on Bloomberg TV: “It’s absurd to demonize the rich for being rich and doing what the rich do, which is get richer by creating opportunity for others.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Zach Epstein BGR NewsAugust 23, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Android 7.0 Nougat is here! It's finally here! But, well, not really... Last year, Google released Android 6.0 Marshmallow and as of Google's latest Android version distribution numbers, it's only installed on 15.2% of active Android devices. To quote a certain presidential candidate, sad! Despite the fact that Android update adoption continues to mosey along at a dreadfully slow pace, the company on Monday released yet another new version of Android. If history has taught us anything — and it has — Android Nougat will become the most popular version of Android sometime in 2018. But don't worry, because you likely won't have to wait quite that long to get it on your Android smartphone. DON'T MISS: I built a Wi-Fi paradise and all I needed was one device When Apple releases a new iOS software update, it's released directly to end users. By controlling iPhone hardware and software Apple is able to bypass third parties (though third parties are obviously involved with testing). Android, of course, works differently in most cases. When Google releases a new Android software update, it has to be tested by Google. And Android device makers. And wireless carriers. Compounding matters is the fact that while Apple only sells a few different iPhone models, Android vendors offer many different phone models at any given time. So, while Google did in fact release Android 7.0 Nougat to the public on Monday afternoon, the only people who can use it for the time being are owners of Google's Nexus branded smartphones. So, when are you going to get Android 7? If you're reading this right now, the odds are fairly good that you're a savvy tech fan who owns a fairly recent flagship Android phone model as opposed to an older phone or a mid-range device. Newer flagships are always the first to get Android updates, and things trickle down from there. As for when the latest crop of smartphones is set to get Nougat, the bad news is that info is scarce for the time being. As both ZDNet and Wired report, however, we can learn a bit from the past. So far only HTC has confirmed anything, having stated that the HTC 10, HTC One A9, HTC One M9 and unspecified other handsets will be updated to Android 7.0 Nougat later this year. That sounds a bit vague indeed, but there are only four months left in 2016 so the wait can't be too long. As for other smartphone vendors, you're probably in fairly good shape if you have a newer Motorola smartphone because Moto is generally quick with updates. LG has a good track record as well. Samsung generally takes a bit longer, which is certainly understandable since it sells far more smartphone models and works with far more carrier partners than any other Android vendors out there. So, if you have a Samsung smartphone, odds are good that you'll still be running an older Android version when you ring in the new year.

The supermarket chain, which has 626 stores across the U.K., recently confirmed on Twitter that Apple Pay is something it is "currently trialling in a few of our stores," but it remains unclear if the testing will lead to a wider rollout in the future. A few Asda customers have recently tweeted about the newly enabled Apple Pay support at superstore locations in Aberdeen, Scotland and Ferring, a small village located about 60 miles southwest from London, England. @Hyperglaucoma Thanks, I believe this is something we're currently trialling in a few of our stores. Thanks, Beth— Asda Service Team (@AsdaServiceTeam) August 15, 2016 As recently as August 12, a support representative tweeted that Asda does not currently accept Apple Pay, but that it does accept contactless payments in some of its stores. Apple Pay generally works where contactless payments are accepted, but some retailers have specific policies against accepting Apple Pay. In 1999, Asda was purchased by Walmart, which recently completed a nationwide launch of its own QR code-based mobile payments solution Walmart Pay in the United States. Walmart was initially committed to the Merchant Customer Exchange (MCX) consortium and its now indefinitely postponed payments service CurrentC. In related news, Clydesdale Bank, Yorkshire Bank, and digital banking service B introduced Apple Pay support for cardholders in the U.K. last week.

In 1965, when the Asquith brothers approached Associated Dairies to run the butchery departments within their small store chain, a merger was proposed. So they joined together with Noel Stockdale, Arthur Stockdale's son, to form a new company, Asquith + Dairies = Asda (capitalised from 1985).

At first I thought it was about data grabbing on your shopping habits, but everyone has a loyalty card to do that these days, so you don't really need the payment method to do that.

We've talked extensively about the missing headphone jack on the upcoming iPhone. While some say that the move will ruin user experience -- something that has already started to seem that way in the real world -- a few argue that someone needs to push the needle to move the technology forward. Now Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak has something to say about the missing legacy audio jack as well. He is asking Apple to fix the Bluetooth first if the company intends to give users to move to wireless headphones. From a Financial Review report: Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak has warned Apple is going to frustrate a lot of customers if it removes the headphone jack from the upcoming iPhone 7. [...] Customers wanting to use their existing, wired earbuds and headphones might have to buy an adaptor that attaches to the iPhone's Lightning port, or to whatever port does remain on the phone. "If it's missing the 3.5mm earphone jack, that's going to tick off a lot of people," Mr Wozniak told The Australian Financial Review. "I would not use Bluetooth ... I don't like wireless. I have cars where you can plug in the music, or go through Bluetooth, and Bluetooth just sounds so flat for the same music." Mr Wozniak said he would probably use the adaptor to connect his existing earphones to his next iPhone, and said that, like many other users he is attached to the accessories that he uses alongside the phone. "Mine have custom ear implants, they fit in so comfortably, I can sleep on them and everything. And they only come out with one kind of jack, so ''ll have to go through the adaptor," he said. "If there's a Bluetooth 2 that has higher bandwidth and better quality, that sounds like real music, I would use it. But we'll see. Apple is good at moving towards the future, and I like to follow that." apple iphone music ← Related Links → Didi Launches Car Rental Service In China Taking the Headphone Jack Off Phones Is User-Hostile and Stupid 'Headphone Jacks Are the New Floppy Drives' iPhone 7 To Start at 32GB Storage, Says WSJ Phones Without Headphone Jacks Are Here... and They're Extremely Annoying iPhone 7 Finishes Last In New Test of Battery Life Steve Wozniak May Swap His Tesla For A Chevy Bolt Apple To Unveil 'AirPods' That Use Custom Bluetooth Chip Apple Announces Event On September 7: iPhone 7, Apple Watch 2 Expected Cory Doctorow On What iPhone's Missing Headphone Jack Means For Music Industry Class Action Lawsuit Grows Over iPhone 6 Plus 'Touch Disease' FBI Investigating Russian Hack Of New York Times Reporters, Others This discussion has been archived.

Very often it clashes with the compression that many audio files use. I found this out the hard way by buying a Bluetooth to stereo device to plug into my home theatre receiver, to play music from my phone over house speakers. If the file was even high-rate MP3, I could hear artifacts of the two compression algorithms fighting with each other; it actually set my teeth on edge. Using AAC instead of MP3 helped, but I'm sure the guys with really sensitive ears will still hear some artifacts to set their teeth on edge, even with something 'lossless' like FLAC or Apple's lossless compression, or maybe even with an uncompressed audio file.

If the source is bad, it cannot be better at the other end. AFAIK, Bluetooth uses an A2DP pipe and this pipe allows the transmission of data using 4 codecs : - SBC : the first historically, the worst in quality - AAC - MP3 - aptX SBC, AAC and MP3 are lossy codecs. I never saw a product that accept AAC or MP3. There must be a license to pay to use MP3; may be also for AAC. aptX is both lossy and lossless. And most source devices (smartphones, computers ...) are aptX ready. So, the technology already here to allow a much better quality than what we know (as long as one can force the use of the lossless variant of aptX, which is ... well, you know ... Obfuscated to say the least). Then what ? Then CSR : the dominating Bluetooth chips manufacturer. More than 70% of the chips last time I heard. CSR has patents on aptX. And patents are meant to make money (yes; were you told otherwise ?). So, the sink devices (BT speakers, car audio systems, ...) are aptX ready only if the manufacturer paid CSR. I'm not sure, may be $1 per product. That's a lot compared to the rest of the BOM. A BT speaker you pay $150 cost less than half when leaving the Chinese factory. And guess what : manufacturers like profit, so they don't pay CSR for aptX and stick to SBC. The hardware is always ready, the firmware may contain the aptX codec, but if the license key, linked to the BT MAC address of the chip, is not present in the firmware, aptX won't be negotiated as an available codec with the source device. Only SBC will be used, even if your source device can do aptX. By the way, if you like your music, listen to it on real speakers in your living room !

Thoughts?   The AUX as in the 3.5mm jack that connects to your (analog) headphone jack? THIS headphone jack?: > It doesn't seem to have that great of a headphone DAC as it sounds mediocre on everything I plug it into. If you're plugging from a regular headphone jack, the DAC in the car shouldn't be involved - it is already analog. As for the "bad DAC", trying turning the volume down considerably on the source and compensating by turning it up on the amp. Any modern DAC should have distortion below the threshold humans can detect in music. HOWEVER, the tiny amp for the headphones or the input it is plugged into could very well be overdriven. Turning down the volume on the source may very well fix your problem. Here's what happens, when things are right and when they're wrong. When levels are right: DAC sends 0.14 volts to headphone amp. Volume is set at 5, so: Headphone amp multiplies by 5 and sends 0.7V to car input. (Car input sees near maximum loudness, line-level car input maxes out at 0.77 volts). Car amp multiplies by 20 and sends 14 volts to speakers. How things go wrong: DAC sends 0.14 volts to headphone amp. Volume is set at 10, so: Headphone amp multiplies by 10 and tries to send 1.4 to car input. Headphone amp can only manage 1volt, so the tops of the waves get cut off. Car input gets 1V, but sinces it maxes out at 0.77V, it chops even more off the top of the wave. Car amp multiplies by 20 and sends 15 volts to speakers, but not as a smooth wave, the tops are chopped of square. Speakers try to move in smooth motion, not chopped, distorting the sound even more. Having the level TOO low on the source creates a different problem. Suppose there is 0.05V of noise in the source and the wire. Source outputs 0.2V of music. Car set to amplify by 40 (to compensate for low source level) also amplifies the noise by 40X. 2V of noise goes to speakers, along with 8V of music.

Jobs had many failures with the Apple III, the Apple Lisa, the Apple Macintosh under his original tenure (others turned it around after his ouster), the NeXT computer, etc. The eventual partial success of NeXTSTEP as Mac OS X was a fluke of history, of Apple's two internal classic Mac OS replacement projects failing. When NeXTSTEP was standing on its own two feet it was never very popular outside of computer science labs. It was Apple's adoption, something independent of Jobs' vision, and the grafting of a Mac OS user interfaces for NeXTSTEP that made it partially successful (its core, not its original UI). Jobs' vision also failed with respect to larger screen iPhones. His vision failed with the 6th generation iPod Nano that was developed under his tenure. Plus Jobs v2.0, the person who revitalized the Mac and pivoted from computers to phones, was a very very different person than the Jobs v1.0 that founded Apple and developed the original Mac. He spent many years learning from old and new mistakes to get from v1.0 to v2.0. Woz in contrast took off a lot of time to teach, literally, in public schools. Its silly to compare Woz and Jobs, in v1.0 days they were trying similar things, but in v2.0 days they were not and hence the comparison fails. The fact remains that in those v1.0 days is was Woz and the Apple // saving Jobs over and over as Job's post Apple // vision failed repeatedly.

Photo: Shutterstock Originally Published By: The co-founder of Apple has predicted backlash if one rumor of the upcoming iPhone 7 holds merit. Steve Wozniak said a lot of customers will be frustrated if Apple removes the headphone jack, without fixing pre-existing issues with the iPhone’s Bluetooth. “If it’s missing the 3.5 mm earphone jack, that’s going to tick off a lot of people,” Wozniak told The Australian Financial Review. “I would not use Bluetooth … I don’t like wireless. I have cars where you can plug in the music, or go through Bluetooth, and Bluetooth just sounds so flat for the same music.” Wozniak said he expects people will still be able to connect wired headphones into the lightning port of the iPhone, but they will have to have an adapter. Steve WozniakPhoto: Getty Images “Mine have custom ear implants, they fit in so comfortably, I can sleep on them and everything. And they only come out with one kind of jack, so I’ll have to go through the adapter,” he said. Wozniak said he would only consider going wireless if Apple fixed problems with its Bluetooth. “If there’s a Bluetooth 2 that has higher bandwidth and better quality, that sounds like real music, I would use it,” he said. “But we’ll see. Apple is good at moving towards the future, and I like to follow that.” The technology entrepreneur said he believed Apple should follow the lead of Google and Samsung by introducing the USB Type-C port — a next-generation industry standard offering ultra-fast data transfer speeds, device charging and video output. “One of my favorite Android phones, the Nexus 5X, uses that connector. It gives it a higher level in my own thinking,” he said. “I think USB-C is going to be the future.” Despite leaving Apple in 1985, Wozniak continues to provide the company with advice and these comments could be no exception. With the iPhone 7 expected to be released in early September, people will have to wait until then to see what Apple has planned.

The bears have something big going for them: Recent momentum. Apple shares have been trapped in a vortex of pain over the past year and a half, with lower highs and lower lows creating what Krinsky terms a "falling channel." But he observes that Apple shares, which are up about 10 percent in the past month, have recently reached up to the top of this channel. And he believes that the stock is set to rise through the top of it, thanks to something else it has going for it: $90. The story of the $90 level on Apple's chart starts in April 2012, when the stock topped out at $92 — which was then actually $644, as it was before Apple's 7-to-1 stock split. After reaching a bit higher a few months later, the tech giant remained stuck below that level until mid-2014. Then, in 2015 and 2016, Apple's dips were frequently capped at $90. That leads Krinsky to posit that $90 is a former level of resistance that has become a level of support. The investor can now clearly see the lines of combat surrounding the stock. Apple is set to either break up and out of its sinking channel, or to break below its significant support level of $90. Krinsky is betting on the former, and further predicting that the stock is set to rise back to $125 or $130, which would take the tech giant near all-time highs. But this thesis is contingent on the stock's support holding. "We'd be a buyer of Apple — as long as it's above $90," he said Monday on CNBC's "Trading Nation." As of midday trading Tuesday, Apple shares are up about a third of a percent, in line with the overall market.

For example, Genee can be copied into an email exchange to act as a virtual assistant of sorts to pin down a time for a business or social meeting. Jha touted Genee as having designed “an intelligent virtual assistant specialized in the appointment decision.” The technology was expected to be put to work in Office 365 software that Microsoft offers as a service in the internet cloud. The team that started Silicon Valley-based Genee in 2014 will join the Microsoft and the existing service will be discontinued next month, according to the companies. Apple confirmed press reports that it has bought startup Gliimpse, which uses machine learning as part of its formula for in letting people securing manage and share personal medical information. “Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans,” Apple said in a statement. Gliimpse offers a unique platform allowing users to compile medical and health data from different sources, and share as needed with third parties, including doctors. “We've built a magical machine,” Gliimpse said on its website. “It takes incomprehensible electronic medical records and turns them into understandable, standardized, coded elements and terminology that both humans and machines can easily understand and use.” Apple has introduced features and software platforms for its mobile devices to be tools for people to manage and improve fitness and health. Microsoft Apps Coming to Lenovo Devices Also on Monday, Microsoft announced that apps such as Office and Skype would be installed on Lenovo mobile devices powered by Android software. The U.S. technology giant and the Chinese computer titan said they were “deepening their strategic relationship” with a move that could add to the ranks of people using Microsoft programs as services hosted in the internet cloud. “The marriage of Microsoft's apps and Lenovo's Android-based devices will enable customers around the world to be more productive, more connected and achieve even more,” Microsoft corporate vice president Nick Parker said in a statement. Lenovo is expected to ship millions of Android-powered devices in the next several years. The deal includes cross-licensing that will allow patented Microsoft technology to be used in Lenovo and Motorola devices, according to the companies. “Our collaboration with Microsoft will create new opportunities for our customers to take advantage of some of Microsoft's most popular apps,” said Lenovo leader of corporate alliances Christian Eigen. Microsoft and leading Android smartphone maker Samsung announced a deal last year to bring the U.S. company's software to smartphone and tablets made by the South Korean firm.

Steve Wozniak, the 'Wizard of Woz', helped create some of the world's most influential tech products,  but when it comes to New Zealand, his first thought was sport. "We played our first Segway polo match - something my Silicon Valley team invented - we played our first match against New Zealand," Mr Wozniak says. But it's not just Segway polo he invented - he's Steve Jobs' other half. They co-founded Apple in a family garage in the mid-1970s. "I always wanted to have the best computers at my command, and what we have today is so much further than what I thought we could have ever had today," he says. The Woz is right about that. Apple now has more money in the bank than the Czech Republic, Peru and New Zealand make in GDP a year. After all, the Californian company created technology we can't live without. "If something is big and huge and everyone is doing it... it's a steamroller," he Wozniak. "You stand in front of it and you're going to get mowed down." Apple's success story was taken to the big screen. "A lot of things I didn't like in it, because they portrayed Steve Jobs at a point in time when he was really a kid and a learner, and they portrayed him as a master thinker and a guider of everything," Mr Wozniak says. "It's never bizarre to see myself on screen because they always portrayed me as being smart and nice." Mr Wozniak left Apple in 1985, but he's still an employee and shareholder and he's still passionate about all things techy. So what does the original computer whiz predict for the future? "The biggest area for growth will be in augmented reality and virtual reality," he says. He reckons it could be used for job training and education. "Maybe someday a computer could be a teacher." And he backs driverless cars, but says there's room for improvement. "A self-driving car needs to see every little thing on the roads so we're only on the path." It's a path that the Woz carved out for us. Newshub.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A      With the general stock market relatively calm amid uncertainty about the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate antics, Motley Fool suggests that it’s the perfect time to follow Warren Buffett’s strategy and buy two stocks loved by consumers. “Apple and Coca-Cola are both great long-term, low-risk investments for investors -- typical characteristics of Buffett investments. If not worth buying, they're at least worthy of a spot on your watch list,” the Fool advised. Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway recently increased its stake in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL ) by 55%, bringing the total value of its Apple stock to about $1.7 billion, the Fool reported. “With a position this large, Berkshire's Apple position is now worth more than its $1.6 billion position in General Motors,” it said. “Given Berkshire's tendency to avoid technology stocks, Buffett or his investing lieutenants must be confident the stock is undervalued in order to build a position worth nearly $2 billion in such a short period of time. Of course, it doesn't take a genius to realize Apple's price-to-earnings ratio of under 13 does look a bit like a buying opportunity; it's not very often market leaders trade with valuations this conservative,” the Fool said. Berkshire owns $17.6 billion worth of Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), making it Berkshire's third-largest holding after Kraft Heinz and Wells Fargo, the Fool said. “With a price-to-earnings ratio of 25, the stock certainly doesn't look as cheap as Apple. But when it comes to a sustainable business, Coca-Cola is one of the best examples there is. So investors shouldn't expect Coca-Cola to trade at a cheap-looking valuation any time soon. Combining its powerful beverage brands with the company's unparalleled global distribution, Coca-Cola boasts both pricing power and economies of scale -- a formidable combination, making up a strong competitive advantage,” the Fool said. “Thanks to Coca-Cola's consistent ability to drive decades of healthy profits for shareholders, it has a nice dividend, too. Investors who buy today get a dividend yield of 3.2% (this easily beats Apple's dividend yield of 2.1%) and the comfort of knowing future increases are likely: Coca-Cola has increased its dividend for 53 years straight.” And Newsmax Finance Insider Tony Sagami applauds Buffett's business acumen for focusing on dividends. "One of the biggest dividend lovers of all is Warren Buffett. He has more than 90% of the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio invested in dividend-paying stocks," Sagami wrote.

The Californian company will launch three models in 2017; one sized at 4.7-inches and two measuring 5.5-inches - one of which will sport a display which curves down over its sides, according to the Nikkei Asian Review . The other two devices will have regular flat screens like past iPhone models, the source added. This is not the first time a curved iPhone has been rumoured. Artist Martin Hajek created these concept images ahead of the iPhone 6 launch, based on similar rumours at the time.

(Photo: Martin Hajek) Nikkei Technology Online has previously reported that Apple met with LG and Samsung to discuss increasing OLED screen production ahead of September 2017 - the date the theoretical iPhone 7s is likely to be released. Both LG and Samsung are among Apple’s suppliers. OLED displays use less power and are generally brighter than their LED counterparts. Samsung is currently the only manufacturer to take advantage of an OLED display’s flexibility, starting with the curved sides of the Galaxy Note Edge in early 2015 and continuing with this year’s Galaxy S7 Edge.

In July it announced sales of its smartphone were down 15% during its third financial quarter, and forecast they would fall again during the fourth. Introducing a new iPhone with a physical difference from its predecessors could help to reignite consumer interest in the smartphone. Apple iphone 6 (Photo: Getty) The last radical hardware change was the introduction of the larger iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, a full 0.7-inches and 1.5-inches larger than the previous iPhone 5, which measured 4-inches. The larger sizes proved such a hit with customers the company posted the biggest profits ever reported by a company, selling a record 74.5 million iPhones in three months, the equivalent of 34,000 units per hour. Apple is due to reveal the much-anticipated iPhone 7 in the next few weeks. Rumours suggest the new model could do away with both the physical home button and headphone jack.

Here is a back-to-school guide for getting the best price on the laptop that's right for you. By Caroline Thompson, Brad's Deals August 23, 2016 Save for later Saved An Acer Aspire laptop, left, and a Lenovo IdeaPad U310 Touch are seen at a demo table at a Microsoft event in San Francisco. Jeff Chiu/AP/File View Caption About video ads View Caption of It's hard to believe, but the time has come to pack up your beach bags and bust out the backpack. If you're a student in need of a new laptop, now is the time to buy. With help from our tech editors, David and Michael, we put together this back-to-school guide for getting the best price on the laptop that's right for you. Apple is offering free Beats headphones with select Mac purchases. Yes, Apple computers are top of the line, but they're also very expensive. Unless your school or program specifies that you NEED one, you're probably going to be just fine opting for a cheaper brand that gives you access to the internet and a decent word processing program. That being said, there are ways to get deals on Apple products if you've got your heart set on the latest MacBook. Apple gives education discounts for both students and educators year-round, but right now, they're sweetening the pot by offering  a free pair of Beats Solo2 Wireless Headphones with select laptop purchases. Recommended: Can you manage your money? A personal finance quiz. The Beats offer ends 9/5, but if you're not in need of a new pair of headphones, another way to get great deals on an Apple laptop is by buying refurbished. We covered this in great detail a few months back in our blog post,  The Case for Apple Refurbs: Why New Isn't Always Better, so check that out if you want more information on why buying refurbished is just as good as buying brand new from Apple. Basically, they back their refurbs with the same one-year extendable warranty they give new products.  Browse through their current selection of refurbished laptops here. Test your knowledge Can you manage your money? A personal finance quiz. Photos of the Day Photos of the day 11/22 Don't discount third-party retailers who sell Apple products. Yes, buying direct from the Apple store (or the Apple Refurb store) is the only way to get access to the Apple warranty and the Apple Geniuses themselves, but if you're looking for actual discounts on Apple products, don't discount third-party retailers like B&H Photo, who offer best-of-web pricing on MacBooks every day. Tech editor David called out B&H specifically  in his recent article on common shopping mistakes that waste money: "Any time we post a great deal on a TV or laptop from a large retailer like  Walmartor  Best Buy, it usually sells really well. Yet if we post an even better deal on a similar item from a smaller reputable dealer like  B&H Photo, it's typically not as popular. We suspect this has something to do with name recognition, maybe some shoppers think only well-known retailers can provide truly good discounts? This is not the case at all! In fact, of the several small tech dealers that we write about, like  B&H,  BuyDig,  PC Richard & Son and  Adorama, run great deals on some of the best tech items on the market. These are deals with lowest prices you will find online, and many of them offer free shipping and don't charge sales tax in most states because they have a smaller physical footprint. Plus, they are all authorized retailers, which is important when it comes to tech, because you want to make sure your warranties will be honored." One major deal on B&H Photo right now?  This 13.3-inch MacBook air for just $799!  Check out B&H Photo's selection of back-to-school MacBook deals here! PC laptops are the best bang for the average college student's buck. They might not be as fancy as that shiny new MacBook, but unless you're running programs like the Adobe Suites, doing a lot of video editing, or are enrolled in a program that specifically calls out the need to have a Mac, a Windows computer is a perfectly acceptable, half-price alternative! Best Buy offers a year-round promotion for college students, that cuts $150 off select laptops and computers. This promotion applies to both Macs and PCs, and is also available on sale items as well.  Check out all Best Buy's college student deals here! Staples also has some decent laptops in their weekly deals section, and finally, here's a roundup of all the laptop deals we currently have live on Brad's Deals: 50 percent off refurbished Dell laptops -- Use code BRADS50 at Dell Refurbished Dell 4K Touchscreen Laptop -- $899 at the Microsoft Store Inspiron Laptop + Free 15" HDTV -- $700 at Dell Lenovo 12" Laptop -- $130 at Best Buy Dell 15.6" Laptop -- $250 at Staples Asus 15" AMD Quad Core Laptop -- $399 at Newegg's Official eBay Store This story originally appeared on Brad's Deals.

Apple Evan Selleck Contributing Editor | August 23, 2016 23 shares 11 7 0 4 0 0 0 1 0               It’s hard to believe that it’s already 2016, and Apple first introduced the Apple Watch, its “most personal device ever,” back in 2014. There was a long wait before future owners could get their hands on it, or the wearable strapped around their wrists, considering the company didn’t release it until April of 2015. Which all boils down to this: It’s been over a year since Apple launched the Apple Watch, and all of its merry variants, and people are starting to expect a new device will be unveiled soon. Rumors suggest that while the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will take up the lion’s share of this September’s event, the Apple Watch 2 will probably make an appearance as well. (And maybe even a totally revamped MacBook Pro, too!) As it stands right now, I can’t help but wonder if this year’s September iPhone event is going to be all that busy, or entertaining for that matter. We know they’re going to go over the iOS 10 features again, especially as they relate to the new iPhones, and Apple will have some things to talk about as far as new features for their new iPhones, but there probably won’t be a lot to talk about. Which is why having more products on hand makes sense. In the technology market, we’re accustomed to things being upgraded in a relatively quick fashion. Every year, mostly. The fact that Apple is waiting two years to announce the Apple Watch 2 is unprecedented, for better or worse, and it will be interesting to see how that carries over to upgrades. It’ll also be interesting to see if they wait to release it, too, so the Apple Watch 2 doesn’t start shipping until April 2017. Whatever the case, it’s the upgrade part I’m most curious about. Recently we heard that the Apple Watch 2 probably won’t feature cellular connectivity, and I’m of the mind that I don’t really care about that. I don’t want to pay my carrier just so my wearable has a network connection, and I basically always have my phone on me, so that takes care of that. Still, I can understand why a network connection would be an important feature for some. With word on the street that the Apple Watch 2 (just like the iPhone 7 compared to the iPhone 6/6s) will be a modest upgrade compared to its predecessor, I can’t help but wonder how many owners of the original wearable will be upgrading this year or next. And maybe that’s why time is on Apple’s side here? If Apple’s second-generation wearable really is a modest upgrade, with built-in GPS baked in, a slightly better battery, and other minor alterations, is it a good thing that Apple waited almost a year and a half to announce it? If Apple doesn’t launch it until April of next year, a full two years after the first’s arrival, will that make it easier to upgrade for current Apple Watch owners? Or will it not matter at all? We already know watchOS 3 is going to arrive for the original Apple Watch, bringing a whole host of new features, and while the Apple Watch 2 will probably get some specific new additions for the new hardware, upgrading might not be that essential for anyone who already owns an Apple Watch — no matter how long it’s been since it launched. So I’m curious to hear from all the Apple Watch owners out there. Are you already planning on upgrading to the next iteration of the wearable whenever Apple gets around to announcing it? Or does it depend on what new features/design Apple brings to the table? Do you plan on keeping the original no matter what, and waiting for the third-generation device? Let me know!

According to Bob Lefsetz, author of an influential music industry newsletter, Grainge sent out a company-wide email on Monday. UMG, which boasted seven of 2015’s 10 best-selling albums and 38.5% of the year’s recorded-music sales, will be the first major label to ban the practice, which many feel has begun to diminish rather than enhance the way music is distributed and consumed. The directive will affect dozens of bands under the UMG umbrella, including all five of this year’s album of the year Grammy nominees: Kendrick Lamar, Taylor Swift, the Weeknd, Chris Stapleton and Alabama Shakes. The practice of artists offering exclusives to competing streaming and download services, including Apple and Tidal, has been gaining traction this year. Both Beyoncé and Rihanna launched their recent albums through Tidal, the streaming service part-owned by Beyoncé’s husband, Jay Z. Frank Ocean: Endless first-listen review – brilliantly confounding Read more The ultra-hyped Frank Ocean release coming exclusively through Apple, coupled with a deal announced earlier this month between Apple and Cash Money Records, whose artists include Lil Wayne, Nicki Minaj, Young Money and Birdman, appears to have been sufficient to provoke label executives to action. Lefsetz, like many others in the business, believes making exclusive distribution deals is anti-competitive and ultimately harms the consumer and the artist. He says the Cupertino hardware giant whose music arm, Apple Music, is steered by former Universal head Jimmy Iovine, should be investigated by the government over anti-trust concerns “because there’s a conspiracy between Apple Music and the industry to change the game, to get everybody to pay for a subscription by putting hit content behind a paywall”. But, he continues, the truth is few care. “Most people don’t give a crap about the new Frank Ocean album. We’ve got an industry that promotes marginal products that appeal to few and makes them unavailable to most people? That’s hysterical!” Unhappiness over Apple’s exclusive control of the Frank Ocean release comes a year after Taylor Swift wrote an open letter to Apple and its CEO, Tim Cook, finding it to be “shocking, disappointing, and completely unlike this historically progressive and generous company” that the firm was refusing to pay artists streaming revenue during its free, three-month trial period. Apple ultimately backed down. Previously, Apple had been forced into an embarrassing apology after loading half a billion Apple iTunes users with the latest U2 album during an iPhone launch. The download, for which Apple paid the band a reputed $60m, proved to be a PR disaster for the company and the band. How Beyoncé's Lemonade became a pop culture phenomenon Read more The company’s dispute with Swift predates the current trend for “exclusives” among streaming services – often accused of paying pitiful rates to copyright holders – as part of an effort to drive up subscriptions. For some artists, the war for subscribers has proved highly profitable even if, as many argue, the services ultimately serve to restrict rather than enhance broader consumer appeal. Last year, Apple paid the Canadian rapper Drake a reported $19m for an exclusive deal – a figure Apple has since disputed – to steal him away from signing with Jay Z’s Tidal. “I think that’s just his competitive nature, and I don’t know if he’s looking at the bigger picture: that it’s not about me and it’s not about him. It’s about the future of the music business,” Jay Z later said of Iovine. But as the battle for artists, especially those from the hip-hop/R&B world, heats up, can Grainge – recently named the music business’s most powerful executive – or any other label rival hope to compete? “Upfront money talks,” points out one former record company head, cautioning that the deals work for the streaming services but not necessarily for artists and labels. But with industry leader Spotify competing against the deep-pocketed tech giants Apple, Google and Amazon, hungry for market share, the stage is set for a new showdown over control as streaming becomes the dominant means of distribution. To Lefsetz, exclusives represent a misreading of the market that will ultimately alienate consumers. “Apple Music is a me-too product that works badly that’s locked behind a paywall and the music industry wants it to be the dominant platform so the fan is squeezed and indie acts are pushed down to the bottom where they belong.” But as the music industry awaits confirmation that UMG is pulling out of streaming exclusives, Lefsetz is also taking artists who sign exclusive distribution deals to task. “Shame on you Frank, and shame on everybody else who takes money from Apple and screws fans. There’s enough money in music without taking every last buck, and the joke is on you, for thinking so short term, you want your music available to everybody, because in these days of information overload we need nobody, everybody is superfluous, you don’t want to enter the marketplace with one hand tied behind your back,” he wrote.

Meanwhile, older models of the MacBook Pro lineup are now being sold for a discounted price to pave way for Apple’s forthcoming laptop flagship.   Apple, the prominent portable computer manufacturer might be enhancing the new technologies to be incorporated in the next MacBook Pro. The rumors on the next MacBook Pro are indeed faster released than Apple's experimentations.  Touch ID technology - according to 9to5mac, this technology is incorporated by Apple in its smart phones, which made the phones more secure. It is a security feature for the users to keep their phones safe. Also, it is such a time saving feature which allows users to unlock the phone without typing long passwords. The stories are in air that the next Macbook Pro will involve the Touch ID technology in the power button or touch pad. As a matter of fact, location doesn't influence much whereas the involvement of this feature might make the user's life easy. Thinner and lighter - a reliable Apple analyst Ming-Chi kuo at KGI securities made a note that Apple is planning to have a lighter and thinner design which takes some design cues from the 12-inch Mac book. The new release is rumored to have lighter weight than the current MacBook Pro available and it might make users think that the old one was weighty - as per 9to5mac, OLED display touch bar - there are rumors of incorporating OLED display touch bar which will replace the physical function keys along the top of the keyboard. The mind behind this OLED bar might make the users tension free in knowing what each key performs. The OLED bar might be customizable and allow user to keep the buttons which is needed. USB type C-ports - these ports are multifunctional type ports, which allows users to connect external devices and charge the MacBook Pro with the same port. This is a USB technology which enables the user to twist the purpose of ports. The MacBook might come with these ports, the same that was featured in 12-inch MacBook earlier. New Intel Chips - according to Pastemagazine, Intel's new micro architecture chip Skylake will be embedded inside the MacBook Pro as per the sources. Intel's new technology Skylake has significant performance and also has some good impact on the battery life of the device. Apple's next release will signify whether these rumors will turn into reality or not however, there is nothing in official from Apple.     Share ( 0 ) Tweet ( 0 ) TAGSmac book pro, apple, rumors Copyright © 2016 News Everyday Fun Stuff See More << Sailor Moon Takes Part On Preventing Sexually Transmitted Disease Through Custom-Made Condoms 'One Piece' Chapter 847 Spoilers, News and Update: Straw Hat Pirates Will Suffer, Sanji Escapes Wedding Capcom's Monster Hunter is in the Works!

Privately owned Chinese electronics company Xiaomi has lauched its first tablet and low-price 4K TV on Thursday. The newly launched 'Mi Pad' is looking to shake up the tablet market to rival Apple's iPad mini with a new low-price slate set. (VCG/VCG via Getty Images) Xiaomi Mi Notebook Air is suggested to be the new competitor of Apple's Macbook Pro when it comes to specs. Xiaomi's only laptop, which currently sells at $627, houses premium specs that are reportedly quite similar to the Macbook Pro. The Chinese online retailer GearBest is expected to ship the device all over the world. Xiaomi Mi Notebook Air comes in two models, the 12.5-inch model and the 13.3-inch model that are suggested to highlight unique designs. However, reports claimed that GearBest will only ship the 12.5-inch model of the notebook. The 12.5-inch model sports a very slim design at 14.88mm that weighs 1.28kg, making it a worthwhile challenger to Apple's Macbook Pro. Some other specs of Xiaomi Mi Notebook Air include 4GB of RAM, 128GB SSD and a 5,000mAh battery that powers the device which supports fast charging. The laptop is integrated with all the standard connectivity options such as HDMI, 3.5mm audio jack, Bluetooth 4.1 and USB Type-C ports. However, Xiaomi seemed to miss the mark on the device's camera front as it only comes with a 1MP camera. Meanwhile, Apple's Macbook Pro 2016 is expected to support a USB-C connector similar to Xiaomi Mi Notebook Air. It also sports a Thunderbolt 2 connector support which is expected to transfer data through a process similar to Apple's legacy FireWire connector. Apart from these, rumors and speculations suggest that Apple will be adding more changes to its MacBook Pro line. Xiaomi Mi Notebook Air has been reported to come with Windows 10 Home Chinese version and an inactivated Windows 10 Home English version. This may pose a little challenge as some characters may still appear in Chinese even after changing the language in the Settings menu. Xiaomi Mi Notebook Air fans are interested about the device pre-orders, it is now currently open and will ship from Sept. 13. Watch Xiaomi Mi Notebook Air review here.

Thanksgiving Eve parties: Highlights at Lehigh Valley clubs Shop O Matic Tips to save you more Entertainment Food & Dining Shop O Matic How to switch carriers and keep your old cellphone Advice on how to bring your cell phone to a new carrier and save. Getty Images/iStockphoto Getty Images/iStockphoto Doreen ChristensenContact ReporterSun Sentinel Dear Doreen: How do I switch carriers and keep my old cell phone? Dear Doreen: Sunday's article about cellphone data plans was informative, but one significant factor in "jumping to a new carrier" is that your phone may not be compatible with that carrier so you'll have the expense of buying a new phone.   That was the case with me. I purchased the iPhone 6s from Apple right when it came out. You have to choose which carrier you'll be going with when you do that because the hardware is different. I chose T-Mobile because of the fact that they don't charge for data usage or texts (and calls are only 20 cents per minute) when I travel out of the country.   Well, after using it for about a year, I found that if you get slightly off the beaten path there is no service while my husband's Verizon phone worked just fine. And when overseas, the data speed was so slow it made using Google Maps impossible.  Doreen Christensen: Cell carriers eliminate overage charges, go unlimited with new data plans | Commentary Cell phone carriers are "simplifying" data plans again. Yet another brutal cell-phone war has erupted as the four major carriers try to please video-hungry consumers with new plans aimed at easing the climbing costs of data. Consumers will be able to save big bucks if they're willing to sacrifice... Cell phone carriers are "simplifying" data plans again. Yet another brutal cell-phone war has erupted as the four major carriers try to please video-hungry consumers with new plans aimed at easing the climbing costs of data. Consumers will be able to save big bucks if they're willing to sacrifice...Read the column So, when I decided to switch back to Verizon, I found out that I would have to buy a new phone because my iPhone 6s was not compatible with Verizon. After spending $800 for a phone that was only 1 year old, I decided to stay with T-Mobile, at least for now.   It's ridiculous that Apple won't make a phone that works with several different service providers! - H.H., Fort Lauderdale Dear H.H.: I have written about this compatibility issue in the past and probably should have included a line about that in my piece. It’s not Apple’s fault. Each network uses different technology to carry cell signals. AT&T and T-Mobile use GSM-compatible devices, and Verizon and Sprint use CDMA. (Here's some useful advice from Consumer Reports on how to bring your cellphone to a new carrier.) Your expensive smartphone is likely compatible on AT&T’s network, which offers premium service similar to Verizon. Call Apple to verify your phone is unlocked and can be used on AT&T's network. When considering a new cell carrier, I always recommend reviewing coverage maps posted on their websites to ensure strong signals are available where you live and frequently travel. Top carriers Verizon and AT&T have spent billions on network infrastructure so you don't lose service when you wander off the beaten path, as you say. That's why service on those premium networks costs more. If you do decide to switch to AT&T, your husband could jump, too, so you both could bundle service and data on the new Advantage plans. AT&T will buy out contracts for up to $650, too, which helps cover the cost of new phones. All the carriers offer similar deals. Also, Best Buy is offering buy-one-get-one free deals on new phones and $200 gift cards with trade-ins.

Rick Munarriz (TMFBreakerRick) Aug 23, 2016 at 11:24AM Image source: Amazon.com. Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) rarely makes mistakes, but it may be about to stumble in the potential pursuit of standing out in the crowded digital music market. Recode is reporting that Amazon could roll out a premium music subscription service as early as next month. That's a brazen move. Offering a smorgasbord of unlimited on-demand tunes for $10 a month is a market where few outside of Spotify and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) have succeeded. Spotify was early, and the international darling was the first to get it right. Apple Music has made a dent in this niche because of the iPhone's success and its earlier market dominance when downloading music was the aural consumption platform of choice. That's about it when it comes to winning with on-demand tunes. The cash-rich tech giants behind Xbox and Android haven't been able to shine through in this market, and Amazon will face an even more challenging experience as a late arrival. The move at least makes some sense since it has already been offering a limited catalog of tracks to Amazon Prime subscribers at no additional cost, but its chances of success here are slim. However, the real gamble for Amazon is that Recode's also reporting that Amazon plans to also offer a discounted service of the same on-demand platform that will be exclusively for Amazon Echo devices. Folks would pay $4 to $5 a month to access streaming music only on the voice-activated, internet-tethered hands-free speaker. That's not going to be much of a market. Echo chamber I've owned Echo since Amazon's introductory offer that made it half-priced for Amazon Prime members early last year. It's a useful gadget to have around at best, and a novelty conversation piece when guests come over at worst. However, the reason why the rumored discounted service will flop is because I can't imagine anyone that would want to only stream on-demand music through Echo. Satellite radio has been a hard sell outside of the car. Spotify and Apple Music sign up most of their users via mobile devices. Premium music is something that works when people are on the move. It's the soundtrack on the drive. It's the score for the gym. There is certainly a time to blast music through a modest speaker of serviceable but not ideal quality, but it's most certainly not the only time that you want to be streaming your favorite playlist or that new album that you've been meaning to hear. That's the rub with a half-priced music service that won't follow you on your commute, stroll, or coffee shop visit. It's not much of an addressable market. You can already stream Spotify or free ad-supported platforms through Echo. An Amazon Prime subscriber also has access to a decent-sized library without paying more. Echo isn't smarting for tunes, and even a juicy subscription discount won't change that. Music labels wouldn't let it happen if it was going to be a hit. They would be undoing the value proposition of $10 a month that is already a sacrifice for the industry if half that much would suffice for music fans. Amazon doesn't whiff often. The ill-fated Fire smartphone, its Endless.com high-end shopping hub, and Amazon Auctions stand out because the leading e-tailer gets it right so much more often than it gets it wrong. Rolling out a premium music service that only works on a single home-tethered device -- if that is in fact what it does next month -- would be one of those rare moments where Amazon misreads the market and fails.     Rick Munarriz owns shares of Apple.

Tuesday, August 23, 2016 [Tweets] [Favorites] Apple Drops “Store” Juli Clover: Apple appears to be making a slight branding change to its retail business, dropping the “Store” moniker when referring to its Apple Store locations. Apple has already made the change online, and all of its store pages now refer to stores by names like “Apple Union Square” or “Apple Valley Fair” or “Apple The Grove,” instead of “Apple Store, Valley Fair” or “Apple Store, The Grove.” John Gruber: Now that Apple’s stores are well established, it makes sense to drop the “Store”. Think about the brands that are Apple’s peers in retail. No one goes to the Tiffany Store or Gucci Store, they just go to Tiffany or Gucci. Daniel Jalkut: The difference between these brands and Apple is that Apple’s identity has long been independent from the notion of a store. Calling it the “Apple Store” was not only important because the stores were a novelty, but because Apple is a brand that transcends retail. Michael Rockwell: I suppose this is the biggest problem with Apple dropping the word “store” — it devalues the Apple brand. Nick Heer: Perhaps “Apple at location” would sound better in nearly all circumstances. But, then again, Apple has always been funny about their phrasing — note, for example, their persistence in dropping the definite article when referring to any of their products: it’s always “iPhone”, never “the iPhone”. Craig Hockenberry: With the removal of “Store” from Apple retail locations, I’m wondering what we’ll call the one on campus. Apple Apple? Mitchel Broussard: A trio of former Apple Store employees recently delved into some stories of their tenure at various retail locations of the company’s well-recognized brand. Although their names were changed to keep their identities a secret, the group which spoke with Thrillist included: Lucas, a Lead Genius with five years of experience; David, who worked part-time as a Sales Specialist for four-and-a-half years; and Tony, a Family Room Specialist for five years at an Apple Store. […] Lucas and David went further into the specifics of the “distinct hierarchy” of the Apple Store, detailing an “odd” dynamic imbalance between entry level employees and those higher up. Most of the full-time positions were “seen as an accomplishment” due to Apple’s extensive training program that flew out applicants to Cupertino or Austin for a few days. This created an “off-putting” atmosphere for new employees trying to get by in the store and still years off from being able to take advantage of the company’s perks.

Scroll down for video  Amazon would like to launch the services in September, but has not finalized deals with major music labels and publishers, Recode reported. Amazon was preparing to launch a standalone music streaming subscription service at $9.99 per month, in line with major rivals, Reuters reported in June, citing sources. The Recode report said one sticking point, sources say, is whether Amazon will sell the cheaper service for $4 or $5 a month.

Earlier this year music streaming service Spotify claimed Apple is attempting to block competition for Apple Music by refusing to approve a new version of the app.  Amazon launched the Echo — an internet-connected speaker powered by Alexa, the company’s AI software — last year, and reportedly sold a million units. HOW THE STREAMING SERVICES COMPARE Service  Cost  Apple Music  $9.99 a month or $14.99 for a family plan (up to six family members) - both with a three-month free trial (£9.99 and £14.99 in UK) Tidal $9.95-a-month for standard sound quality and $19.99-a-month for 'lossless high fidelity sound quality' (£9.99 and £19.99 in the UK) Spotify   Free level with adverts, Premium $9.99-a-month service (£9.99 in the UK) Beats Music   $9.99-a-month or $99 per year Pandora  $4.99-a-month for Pandora's ad-free internet radio service Deezer  Free with adverts, $9.99-a-month for Premium+ (£9.99 in the UK) Rdio  Free with adverts, Rdio Unlimited costs $9.99 (£9.99 in the UK) and US users can also get Rdio Select for $3.99 a month with limited downloads  It has added hundreds of new features to the sevice,  and the e-commerce giant envisions its voice assistant functioning like the 'Star Trek computer', in that it will answer users no matter where they are in their home with instant feedback. And, more than 10,000 developers have registered to add the virtual assistant to products, bringing this dream closer to a reality. Since Amazon has outsourced Alexa, more than 10,000 developers have registered to build more innovated skills for the virtual assistant. And the firm boasts that this group has grown Alexa's skills to over 1,400. Since the beginning of 2016, Alexa's smart home API skills selection has increased by more than 5 times. Amazon wants Alexa to boldly go where no AI has gone before. David Limp, Amazon's senior vice president for devices, envisions the voice assistant functioning like the 'Star Trek computer', in that it will answer users no matter where they are in their home and right away  'We are thrilled that tens of thousands of developers are already building skills for Alexa, helping to grow our Alexa skill selection by 50% in just over a month,' said Steve Rabuchin, Vice President, Amazon Alexa. 'We're excited to introduce new features that make it even easier for customers to discover those skills.' Spotify's general counsel, Horacio Gutierrez, sent a letter to Apple on 26 June, saying Apple is 'causing grave harm to Spotify and its customers', according to Recode.  The letter says Apple turned down a new version of the app while citing 'business model rules' and demanded Spotify use Apple's billing system if 'Spotify wants to use the app to acquire new customers and sell subscriptions.' Apple's Eddy Cue unveiled the major overhaul of Apple Music at the firm's WWDC in San Francisco earlier this month, which came after repeated complaints from customers over the streaming service Apple launched Apple Music, its own music service, in June 2015. For the past year, Spotify has argued publicly that Apple's subscription policies punish third-party music services that use Apple's platform, in favour of Apple Music.   Read more: Amazon wants to sell a cheaper music subscription service that will only work on its Echo player - Recode Share or comment on this article e-mail 17 shares Most watched News videos Gruesome moment Korean chef dissects a LIVE octopus Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Teen films a burning 'meteorite' moving across sky in Japan Shocking moment man hits women in mass chicken shop fight Supermodel Gigi Hadid fights off man who grabs her at Milan show Tidal surge filmed on Sunaoshi River in Tagajo, Japan The moment a 7.4 magnitude earthquake hit Fukushima Kim Kardashian attacked in Paris by notorious prankster Mystery homeless woman in Rome avoids questions from reporter Cyclist films moment car causes him to crash then drives away 100 special police agents protect suspected paedophile from mob Doorman knocks-out troublemaker during two-on-one confrontation Six rebel electors have signed an agreement to try to block...

Welcome Home: Google's $130 smart speaker Google's smart Home speaker still has a lot of learning to do, and loses out to Amazon's Echo in some areas - but has incredible potential 'Not quite an iPhone replacement': Google's Pixel phone Google's Pixel handset is good, and boasts an amazing camera and smart assistant. It's the king of the Android handsets - but still not great. Xbox One S review: Console that will make your 4K TV shine Microsoft's Xbox One S has shrunk the giant console by 40%, and is stunningly designed console with 4K HDR capabilities - but comes with some caveats. The $1,000 wireless speaker that really IS worth the price: Naim Mu-so Qb review Naim's incredible Mu-So Qb takes you back to the good old days - where the music captivates and enthralls, rather that simply being something in the background. The hi-tech $2,000 spin bike that really could change your life Peloton's hi-tech bike lets you stream live and on demand rides to your home - and it's one of the best examples of fitness technology out there - at a price. Apple's new 9.7inch iPad Pro is a powerhouse you can take anywhere Apple has added a few improvements to the smaller version, creating a tablet that is astonishingly powerful, but, unlike its big brother, is something you'll be able to carry everywhere. A familiar old friend that could be the perfect starter phone: Dailymail.com's verdict on the iPhone SE The new iPhone SE has a 4inch screen and familiar design - but has had a huge upgrade on the inside, making this a perfect first time iPhone. Speaker that looks as good as its sounds: B&W Zeppelin Wireless review It's not cheap, but the $699 (£500) Zeppelin Wireless is perfect for the design conscious music fan. The iPad grows up: Apple's iPad Pro The iPad Pro is, for many, a real laptop replacement - and a way to combine work and play in a gadget that will last all day and won't break your back to carry. 'A glimpse into the future of the living room': The new Apple TV Apple says apps are the future of TV, and while its new $149 box does have some issues, its combination of streaming services, games and other apps make it the best way to make your TV smart. The end of wonky wifi: Google's OnHub It's incredibly simple to set up, and we found it tripled the speed of our home wifi connection - but at $199 is expensive.. The best all in one wireless speaker you'll ever hear: Naim Mu-so review It might not be a name familiar to the US market, but Naim is a legendary British brand hoping to make a splash with the American launch of its $1499 Mu:So speaker. From the Makers of Candy Crush Farm Heroes Saga, the #4 Game on iTunes.

Owners of Nexus devices, including the Nexus 6, the Nexus 5X, the Nexus 6P, the Nexus 9, and the Pixel C, should be upgraded to Android Nougat over the next few weeks. The same goes for anyone enrolled in the Android Beta Program. However, everybody else will have to wait until the phone manufacturers decide they’re worthy.

Which is a huge shame, and probably the biggest problem with Android Google has left to fix in the future. Apple Plans a Curved iPhone for 2017 Apple is rumored to be releasing a curved iPhone in 2017, as it prepares three new models designed to give consumers more choice. The iPhone equipped with a curved screen will be sold as a premium model, with the standard model (sans curves) coming in two different sizes. Ads by Google This all comes courtesy of a report by the Nikkei Asian Review, which cites “a source familiar with Apple’s plans”. This source supposedly said, “There will be a 4.7-inch model, another that will be 5.5-inches and a premium handset that will be either 5.5-inches or larger equipped with a screen bent on the two sides.” Apple sees iPhone sales fall again? Well, maybe innovate again and see sales rise. Oh yeah, DON'T REMOVE THE STANDARD HEADPHONE JACK MORONS! — Joe (@bxbrew) July 27, 2016 This description is rather vague, and leaves a lot of wiggle room as to the final design. However, if it’s true in any capacity, it suggests Apple is copying Samsung in its bid to win back customers. In fact, Samsung will be one of Apple’s suppliers, as the Korean company is the only one currently producing flexible OLED screens. This is Apple playing catch-up to a certain extent, as Samsung already offers consumers curved screens on the Galaxy 7 Edge and Note 7. But then Apple needs to do something to compete, as Android now enjoys an 86.2% share of the market Android Is Killing iOS, Uber Launches Self-Driving Cars...

Sony Ups the Price of PlayStation Plus Sony is raising the price of PlayStation Plus 5 Awesome Games That Make PlayStation Plus Worth The Price [MUO Gaming] 5 Awesome Games That Make PlayStation Plus Worth The Price [MUO Gaming] I recently wrote an article about the biggest rip offs in the history of video games. In it, I was quick to point out that Microsoft charges $60 a year for a service that simply... Read More , the subscription service which allows PlayStation owners to play online and earns them free games as a reward. In the United States, annual rates are increasing from $50 to $60, with the 3-month subscriptions rising from $18 to $22. The monthly subscriptions are remaining at $10. The price increases come into effect on September 22nd. PlayStation Plus content manager Greg Lewickyj explained the price changes on the PlayStation Blog, saying: “PlayStation Plus strives to enrich your PlayStation experience through a world-class service built for our fans. This marks the first time that PS Plus membership prices will increase in the U.S. and Canada since the launch of the service in 2010. The new pricing reflects the current market conditions while enabling us to continue providing exceptional value to our members.” Suffice to say this hasn’t gone down well with PlayStation gamers. There have been complaints for months regarding the quality of the free games Sony is giving away, and the increases have been announced in the same month the PS Plus freebies were especially bad.

Watch Paper Slice Through Wood And finally, if, like us, you didn’t think paper could possibly ever cut wood, this video will likely blow your mind. OK, perhaps that’s a little too hyperbolic Buzzworthy: 5 Clickbait Headlines Guaranteed to Annoy [We Ask You Results] Buzzworthy: 5 Clickbait Headlines Guaranteed to Annoy [We Ask You Results] You may consider the headline of this article to be clickbait. But it isn't, honestly. Read More , but it will at least demonstrate the power of motion, as that’s all that’s required to make paper slice through wood. Under normal circumstances, paper would completely fail to even make a dent in wood. But when it’s attached to a circular saw the motion makes it much stiffer and adds a healthy dose of friction. The result is a sheet of paper capable of slicing through wood. While leaving some rather impressive scorch marks.

In the context of a curved smartphone, OLED panels offer one major advantage. Unlike traditional panel types, OLED screens are flexible, making viable the creation of curved screen smartphones like the recent Note 7. However, at the moment, there’s only one company that produces at scale the type of OLED panels Apple needs to make a curved iPhone: Samsung. According to Hsieh, Apple will single source OLED panels for the 2017 5.5-inch iPhone from its South Korean rival. Apple is expected to announce its 2016 lineup of iPhones on September 7. Nikkei, corroborating earlier reports from Bloomberg, says it expects the company to release a 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus model with two back-facing cameras, and another 4.7-inch model with a signal back-facing camera. Moreover, according to Bloomberg‘s Mark Gurman, in an effort to make its new smartphone even thinner, Apple has removed the iPhone 7’s headphone jack. He says consumers can also expect the device to feature a pressure-sensitive home button. Based on leaks that have come out in the past, the iPhone 7 will look a lot like the current iPhone. SourceNikkei Asian Review ViaThe Verge Mo Dabbas ohhhh. now samsung will sue apple for the curved edges that Samsung is gonna provide. Such a smart move Sammy. PopCornTime let’s hope costco will have some discount on Pop-corn Ali F. Actually, Apple will sue Samsung. They will argue that Samsung guessed what Apple will do on 2017 and did it before. Now Samsung need the best lawyer firm to defend their devices or else! Captain Henry Morgan “a premium handset that will be either 5.5-inches or larger equipped with a screen bent on the two sides”. Oh you meant like Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge? Omar I got a warm, fuzzy feeling inside when I read that Apple was going to get their screens from Samsung. Ali F. The problem is, when iZombies buy the “NEW” edge bent iPhone, they will start showing off how their iPhones are great and always ahead of everything else. Do Do Lol, yes of course removing the headphone jack will make the iPhone thinner. Mamba Every time these kinds of speculated and unofficial rumors starts going around, I would always jump right to the haters, oops, comments section. And every time I see exactly the same kinds of comments like: 1) Apple is copying others now 2) fanboys are gonna brag about it again 3) Apple will sue others and claim they did it first It’s getting boring year after year after year. Anyone else got something new for a good laugh? Do Do Yea, it’s boring but still based on truth. Mamba It goes both ways. Anton Bruckner So what? We should tolerate idiotic Blackberry fanboys who would have you believe another phone with tactile keys is something new and exciting? lol! There isn’t much that’s going to change with this technology in the near future and most consumers seem pretty satisfied as it is with all the choices that exist to fit your budget. Square passport phones, slider phones and more slabs are nothing to get thrilled about either. Do Do You know, I am a little tired but I don’t get your point. Nor what you’re talking about as far as Blackberry “fanboys” go. Blackberry fanboys? I haven’t even seen a blackberry outside of a work environment in a couple of years let alone a Blackberry fanboy. Sighmonsez It’s just Anton being Anton. meister The new iPhollow 7!!! It will also have a new unlock system called iScan as in eyeScan! 😀 Brad Fortin I still don’t see the appeal of the curved edge. It looks shiny and novel, sure, but I don’t see what problem it’s trying to solve. What problems are people having on a flat screen that a curved screen solves? Do Do It solves nothing. Samsung fanboys are rationalizing it now and so will Apple fanboys if it comes out. I tried one recently in a store and found it completely pointless. Furthermore, when I hold my current note 4 with one hand I’m often opening apps and moving apps that are close to the edge on the desktop by accident. I can only imagine this would be worse with a curved screen, while its on of course. However, if I’m being honest, it does look good.

 Android Pay finds its first loyalty partner in Walgreens BI Intelligence Aug. 23, 2016, 11:01 AM 678 facebook linkedin twitter email print BII See Also Dunkin' Donuts emphasizes its growing rewards program EMV is growing by leaps and bounds at some merchants Chase Pay has officially launched This story was delivered to BI Intelligence "Payments Briefing" subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. Walgreens, the U.S. pharmacy chain with more than 8,000 stores, will become the first merchant to integrate its loyalty program into Android Pay, the company announced.  Users will be able to tap to earn and redeem loyalty points at the checkout ahead of making a payment. This is a significant development because loyalty is the top desired service among mobile wallet users, and Apple Pay already offers this capability. Twenty-two percent of US adults noted that they would like to use their mobile phones to organize, track, and store gift cards, memberships, loyalty, and rewards points as of the end of last year, according to the Federal Reserve. That number spikes when loyalty is directly affiliated with mobile wallets specifically — 67% of UK and US adults want loyalty card integration for their mobile wallets, according to data from Urban Airship. And when it is available, consumers take to it quickly. In Q4 2015, just a few months after Apple Pay enabled store and loyalty card integration, 25% of cards loaded into Apple Pay among US iPhone 6 users were store or loyalty cards. Pharmacy chains are a good place for mobile wallets to begin implementing loyalty. It’s likely that pharmacy chains like Walgreens have strong loyalty programs with an active, engaged user base because consumers tend to visit on a recurring basis to buy goods or fill prescriptions. Walgreens counts 85 million members in its Balance Rewards program, 45 million of whom are likely Android users based on data from comScore.    That provides Android Pay with a strong addressable base who might test Android Pay for Balance Rewards and ultimately load in other payment cards and begin using the service in other locations. And in turn, it might give the service, which remains largely underutilized, a needed boost and begin to kickstart adoption. Mobile payments are becoming more popular, but they still face some high barriers, such as consumers' continued loyalty to traditional payment methods and fragmented acceptance among merchants. But as loyalty programs are integrated and more consumers rely on their mobile wallets for other features like in-app payments, adoption and usage will surge over the next few years. Evan Bakker, research analyst for BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on mobile payments that forecasts the growth of in-store mobile payments in the U.S., analyzes the performance of major mobile wallets like Apple Pay, Android Pay, and Samsung Pay, and addresses the barriers holding mobile payments back as well as the benefits that will propel adoption. Here are some key takeaways from the report: In our latest US in-store mobile payments forecast, we find that volume will reach $75 billion this year. We expect volume to pick up significantly by 2020, reaching $503 billion. This reflects a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 80% between 2015 and 2020. Consumer interest is the primary barrier to mobile payments adoption. Surveys indicate that the issue is less the mobile wallet itself and more that people remain loyal to traditional payment methods and show little enthusiasm for picking up new habits. Integrated loyalty programs and other add-on features will be key to mobile wallets taking off. Consumers are showing interest in wallets with integrated loyalty programs. Other potential add-ons, like in-app, in-browser, and P2P payments, will also start fueling adoption. This strategy has been proved successful in China with platforms like WeChat and Alipay. In full, the report: Forecasts the growth of US in-store mobile payments volume and users through 2020. Measures mobile wallet user engagement by forecasting mobile payments' share of their annual retail spending. Reviews the performance of major mobile wallets like Apple Pay and Samsung Pay.

 There may be a 3rd iPhone model next year with a better screen Antonio Villas-Boas Aug. 22, 2016, 1:29 PM 6,736 facebook linkedin twitter email print A report from Japanese news site Nikkei claims that Apple will unveil a third iPhone model with a 5.5-inch organic light-emitting diode display with curved side edges. It was first reported by Reuters in January that Apple could adopt OLED displays for iPhones in 2018, but if this latest rumor is true, then we could see this new OLED iPhone as soon as next year. kedarkulkarni95/YouTube The third iPhone model will apparently be released alongside the regular 4.7- and 5.5-inch iPhones with LCD displays. OLED displays are superior to the LCD technology found in iPhones. For one, they have much better contrast where darks are darker and brights are brighter, which helps make anything on the screen "pop." OLED displays also reproduce deeper colors than an LCD could. They can even be more power-efficient than LCD displays, as they can turn off specific parts of the screen for anything that's colored black. An LCD display, on the other hand, is always on, even when displaying the color black. Below is a comparison between the iPhone 6S Plus' LCD display against the OLED display on the Galaxy Note 5. Both have the same picture of the color black, but it's clear that the iPhone's LCD screen looks more gray than it does black. The same image on the Note 5's OLED display is clearly showing a more accurate black color. In fact, the majority of the Note 5's screen is off because OLED displays actually turn off to display the color black.

The location, which first opened on October 29, 2005, has been closed for renovations since March. The renovated space is expected to have a Jony Ive-inspired next-generation design and double the square footage within the shopping mall. Apple The Oaks, opened on October 29, 2005, prior to renovations Meanwhile, Apple's retail location at the CambridgeSide Galleria shopping mall in Cambridge, a suburb of Boston, Massachusetts, will close for renovations one day later on Sunday, August 28. During the closure, Apple recommends that customers visit the nearby Apple Boylston Street or Apple Chestnut Hill locations. The closure is presumably to allow for similar next-generation design updates. Apple CambridgeSide, opened on December 15, 2001, prior to renovations Apple is in the process of renovating several of its retail locations in the U.S. and around the world. The new layout includes a combination of The Avenue, Genius Grove, The Forum, The Plaza, and The Boardroom. All new locations since around mid 2015 have been based on the new design language, including the flagship Apple Union Square. Apple now has over 30 retail locations based on the new design language.

Since the Galleria store is closest to home, I had assumed many had been done by the time they renovated it because Buffalo is a medium sized city. Walden Galleria is technically in Cheektowaga, which is even smaller! I remember when that store was closest to me until (1) Apple Mapleview ('http://www.apple.com/ca/retail/mapleviewcentre/') opened and (2) I moved closer to Toronto, which has 4 stores within city limits and another 2 stores in the direct suburbs.

The cordless, portable 1A/3.70V charging solution has a built-in 4,000 mAh lithium-ion battery that can charge an Apple Watch up to six times before it needs to be recharged itself. GoPower Watch has a built-in magnetic charging puck, the same one that comes with the Apple Watch, and a USB port for simultaneously charging an iPhone with a Lightning cable. It has pass-through charging while connected to power via Micro-USB, meaning that Apple devices charge first, and then the battery pack recharges. To charge an Apple Watch or iPhone, simply press the button on the front of the GoPower Watch. The LED indicator displays battery levels and charge status. GoPower Watch is available in Space Gray for $99.95 on Kanex's website. The portable battery works with all 38mm and 42mm Apple Watch models.

PT Written by Dave Mark One of the features I’m most excited about in this new round of betas is the ability to use my Apple Watch to automatically unlock my Mac. To set this up yourself, you’ll need an Apple Watch running watchOS 3 and a Mac running Sierra. You’ll also need your iPhone and Mac to be using Two-Factor Authentication, as opposed to the older Two-Step Verification (2SV). When I first encountered 2FA and 2SV, I was confused. The names are very similar, and the process of switching from one to the other is not particularly straightforward. To keep this straight in your head, think: step is old, factor is new or, as I prefer, think: Only one of these is authentic. Rene Ritchie put together this excellent guide that walks you through the process of enabling Two-Factor Authentication. Note that if you have the older Two-Step Verification enabled, you’ll need to disable it first. Rene’s guide will show you how to do that as well. Once you have 2FA enabled on your Apple ID (check your iPhone and Mac to make sure the change shows up on both), head over to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General, and check the Allow your Apple Watch to unlock your Mac checkbox. I originally added a password to my Mac to keep my cats from laying on my Mac, causing unpredictable results (like this one time, when my cat Skyped my friend, and he thought I was having a stroke – true story). Moments after I turned on Apple Watch unlock, I went over to get a cup of coffee, my cat laid on my keyboard, my Apple Watch kindly unlocked my Mac for her, and I heard an ominous beeping coming from my Mac. Hmmm. No harm done. But good to know that your Mac will be unlockable anytime you are within Bluetooth range. DonatelloNinjaTurtle Hmm, from some early reviews it sounded like it was only supposed to be unlockable when the watch is within inches of the Mac? Jordan Krahn You’ll also need to have a Mac that supports Continuity I believe (not an option on my 2011 iMac) Steven Fisher Please say you still have that “are you having a stroke?” log and you can anonymize it and post it somewhere (maybe Twitter). 🙂 By Jim Dalrymple and Dave Mark About Contact The Dalrymple Report Podcast Membership Sponsorship Shop Amazon—Support The Loop Ads Via The Deck Give the Gift of Good Sleep Thanks to Hullo for sponsoring The Loop this week.

Today’s How-To is focused on something very specific but with a lot of optimization potential: trimming down your Mac’s photo library. Particularly after installing OS X 10.10.3 with Apple’s new Photos app, you might be surprised to learn that you’ve lost a lot of hard drive space, and that there are suddenly tons of duplicate photos on your Mac. After installing OS X 10.10.3, the new Photos app converted my 90GB Aperture library into a 126GB Photos library, and left both on my hard drive. That’s an incredible amount of wasted space attributable to duplicates, so it’s no surprise that a $1 utility called Duplicate Photos Fixer Pro has recently become the #1 paid Mac App Store app, while a superior alternative called PhotoSweeper ($10) is in the top 50. I’ve used both apps, as well as many others, and can help you choose the one that’s best for your needs… Gauging The Size Of Your Mac’s Problem If you’re not sure just how much space your photo collection is consuming on your Mac, there are two ways to figure it out. The simplest technique is to open a Finder window and right-click the Pictures folder under Favorites, choosing Get Info. A window will pop up with a number, which in my Mac’s case was over 236GB between a number of different photo libraries — Apple’s Photo Booth, Aperture, iPhoto, and Photos, just to name a few. If you do the math relative to your hard drive’s size, you’ll understand how much photo libraries are weighing down your computer: they were consuming around 1/4 of my iMac’s 1TB of drive space. I personally like to see disk information presented visually rather than mathematically. GrandPerspective, the free disk space mapper I recommended last week, quickly shows just how out of control the photo libraries have become: my OS X Photos and Aperture libraries are the two huge blocks on the left, consuming 1/3 of all used space on the drive. If your libraries are this big, you have a lot of potential to recover hard drive space. But even if your photo library is smaller, there’s a very good chance that there are duplicate images inside, swelling what could be a manageable collection into something needlessly bigger. The duplicate eliminating tools below turn what could be days of agonizing hunting-and-pecking into a mostly automated hour or two of deleting unneeded images. Exercise Extreme Caution Before going any further in this How-To, read this carefully: Be very careful (yes, that’s bold, underline, and italics all at the same time) before deleting any of your “duplicate” photos, particularly in bulk. One of these libraries may be the only record you have of precious memories, and making the choice to just dump a giant collection of images can be calamitous. That’s why lost photo recovery tools are almost as popular as duplicate removers. Exercising caution when using duplicate photo tools can be challenging. Each app makes certain assumptions (with your guidance) as to what should be called a “duplicate.” You can make those assumptions strict, or loosen them to catch images that are extremely similar. The looser your rules are, and the less you manually manage the list of duplicates before hitting the “Delete All” button, the greater the chance you’ll accidentally delete something worthwhile. It’s tempting to dump as much as possible when you’re presented with the opportunity to reclaim gigabytes of lost space by just hitting a button, but be sure you’ve given everything a look-over, first. The same warning applies if you’re thinking of deleting an entire previous photo library. If you’ve already decided to switch from iPhoto or Aperture to OS X Photos or Adobe’s Lightroom 6, you could trash your old iPhoto/Aperture photo library and use Photos or Lightroom’s new library for everything going forward. My advice: move your old library in its entirety over to a high-quality external hard drive and keep it there until you are absolutely certain that Photos or Lightroom imported everything correctly. That way, you have the option of going back and grabbing lost images if needed, but aren’t cluttering up your main hard drive with an old photo collection that’s almost entirely duplicates. PhotoSweeper At $10, Gwinno Software’s PhotoSweeper isn’t the cheapest of the duplicate photo removal tools out there, but in my experience, it’s the best. With the recent release of version 2.1, PhotoSweeper (unlike cheaper rivals) can find duplicates within OS X Photos libraries, as well as iPhoto, Aperture, and Lightroom libraries, plus images that are sitting in random photos on your hard drives. It has a reasonably straightforward but powerful user interface, which begins by giving you a Media Browser showing any Photos, iPhoto, Aperture and Lightroom libraries on your machine, letting you decide which to drag over into the main window for processing. If you only want to look at a portion of a given library, you can, or you can bring multiple libraries and folders together for comparison.PhotoSweeper will take some time (varying based on the speed of your Mac and size of your photo collection) to canvas everything, then will present you with a “What to Find?” window. This is one of PhotoSweeper’s best features, as you can pick from four main options: “Duplicate Files” (shown above), “Similar Photos: Basic,” “Similar Photos, Advanced,” or “Series of Shots.” Each one will process your photo library differently. Duplicate Files looks strictly for pure duplicates, and has only one option: “Compare photos with the same name only.” Leave it unchecked and PhotoSweeper will look at each photo’s checksum, presenting you only with 100% identical files; check it and you’ll only see 100% identical files with the same name.  While Duplicate Files is basically foolproof, Similar Photos loosens the rules. Under Basic Settings, Similar Photos will let you use fuzzy logic — image analysis on a scale from “partial” to “exact,” plus time comparisons and your choice of either same size or same aspect ratio — to find images that are close to one another. This is an ideal tool to use if your library somehow contains full-sized original images (the ones you probably want to keep forever), slightly modified versions, and/or smaller thumbnails that were created by another app. Using the “same aspect ratio” setting, PhotoSweeper can look for images that are the same overall but in larger and smaller versions. The Advanced Settings tab lets you calibrate the comparison engine, looking for matchups either of thumbnails or histograms, as well as color and detail levels in the thumbnails. Series of Shots is the last option, included to handle split-second bursts of photos like the ones taken by recent iPhones, or looser groupings of images taken at nearly the same time. This option shows you clusters of images taken close together — you set how close — and lets you pick the one you prefer without looking for a 100% exact match. It’s handy to get rid of not-quite-as-good “near-duplicates” that might be taking up a ton of space in your library. Once you’ve selected your sorting scheme, PhotoSweeper will go through everything and create “groups” of photos that it has identified as being similar. Each group will contain at least two photos, so you can either trust PhotoSweeper to automatically mark the ones it thinks should be deleted, or manually mark them yourself. PhotoSweeper has a list of 20 Auto Mark rules hidden within its Preferences menu, so you can check the rules you want to use, put them in the right order, and run the marking process. For instance, if you simply want the app to auto-mark the file with smaller size, DPI, or dimensions, you can do any of those; you could also auto-mark files with lower star ratings, fewer keywords, or other metadata criteria. Auto marking saves you from having to manually choose the image to delete from each group yourself, but should always be manually audited before moving on. That manual audit — checking as many images as you want to make sure you’re not tossing out good files — is your most critical step. When you hit the Trash Marked button, all green images will stay, and all red ones will disappear. You may need to let PhotoSweeper automatically open the photo library’s app (as with OS X Photos) so it can complete the deletion process. Using PhotoSweeper in the right way can safely free up a tremendous amount of space on your Mac; you can run it several times using different “What to Find?” options to eliminate different types of duplicates. Even though you may get tired during the manual audit process — and might just opt to trust that PhotoSweeper is picking the right duplicates to eliminate — bear in mind the cautionary details above so that you don’t lose any important files. Duplicate Photos Fixer Pro Although it’s currently at the top of the Mac App Store charts due to its temporarily low $1 price, Systweak Software’s normally $19 Duplicate Photos Fixer Pro has some serious limitations compared with PhotoSweeper. It won’t import OS X Photos, Aperture, or Lightroom libraries — only “iPhoto 9 or newer” and individual photos. You can choose from two settings: “Exact Match,” or “Similar Match,” and you’ll see an ad every time you don’t find duplicates. Duplicate Photos Fixer Pro has far fewer settings to tweak its matching engine. It generates and compares only thumbnails, not histograms, and can use time intervals, GPS proximity, and a sliding scale “matching level” to sort your photos. At its weakest matching level, you’ll see “duplicates” that are clearly substantially different shots; at the strongest matching level, images will need to be pixel-perfect clones to be IDed. Even after doing the initial comparison, you can adjust the Matching Level slider and see just how many shots would be considered duplicates at each of the slider’s levels. Like PhotoSweeper, you can auto-mark images using rules, though there are only six rules here, and they’re not as useful. Hitting the Trash Marked button lets you purge duplicates after a quick warning, with a reminder that you can find any accidentally deleted images in the trash can. Having used PhotoSweeper quite extensively with Aperture and OS X Photos libraries, it’s hard for me to recommend Duplicate Photos Fixer Pro given that it’s so much more limited — fewer types of photo libraries are supported, the duplicate finding and auto marking features are less powerful, and there are other little annoyances in the user interface. At its normal $19 price point, there would be zero reason to prefer it over PhotoSweeper. But if you’re only using iPhoto or loose photo folders, want a budget solution, and don’t mind doing searches that mightn’t net as many actual duplicates as PhotoSweeper finds, this could be worth a try. One More Option: Duplicate Detective Although I wouldn’t generally recommend it for photographs, there’s another handy app for getting rid of duplicate files: Fiplab’s $3 Duplicate Detective. This app can be used across numerous types of files, quickly finding exact matches and letting you purge them. You simply point Duplicate Detective at a folder (or hard drive) full of files, start the scan, then pick the files to delete using simple (oldest/newest) criteria. Why include Duplicate Detective in this article? Depending on how you’ve organized your photo libraries, you may have stored your iPhone, iPad, or iPod home videos along with your photos, or separately on your hard drive. These video files (particularly slow-motion and 1080p HD videos) can be gigantic, and if you want to hunt for duplicates of them or any other non-photo file, Duplicate Detective can help.

But then I moved the older Aperture library to another external drive, unmounted it, and the Photos library was still there… I don’t know how it works really, and what type of decision will Photos make to keep a referenced library, or make a duplicate of it. And I must have had a duplicate, otherwise disconnecting the drive would have resulted is seeing no pics in Photos (full size, I mean). And if you have a referenced Photos library, you will have to live with 2 “libraries” on your Mac forever? What is the logic behind Referencing vs Duplicating? available disk space?

LikeLiked by 2 people coolfactor - 2 years ago The new Photos library uses “hard links” to the files on disk. In this case, iPhoto, Aperture and Photos all have libraries pointing to the same files. Delete one or two of those libraries, and the third library still points to the files on disk. There’s no duplication happening, just links. The visual nature of the Finder may lead you to think that the photos live “inside” those libraries, but that’s just a representation. The file system looks at how many links are associated with each file, and when that reaches zero is the file actually deleted from disk. LikeLiked by 1 person David Griffin - 2 years ago Reply Are you SURE you have duplicate photos, or are you just witnessing the symptoms of the use of hard links?? Photos uses hard links so that your photos are NOT duplicated. You might see a 80GB iPhone library and a 100GB Photo library, but this does NOT mean you are using 180GB worth of space!!!! You might only be using 110GB of space, because of the overlap of hard links. Be careful!!! What are hard links? Just two hard references to the same file on the disk. If a file has two hard links, and you delete one, the file remains intact and NO space is freed. Delete the last hard link, and the file is removed. LikeLiked by 3 people Jeremy Horwitz - 2 years ago Reply The problem I’m personally seeing (of two separate large libraries) may be a symptom of the way Photos handled migration from a referenced (and notably much larger) Aperture library.

You might have had a 90gb iPhoto library and created a 126 gb photos library. But that doesn’t mean you’ve used another 126 gb of your storage space–or even any at all. The second photo library uses hard links; the photos are NOT duplicated. I’ve nothing against deleting “duplicates” but what really matters to your anecdotal analysis is how much space remained before you created the photos library, and how much after. Then, backup the (old) iPhoto’s library to an external drive and then, again, see how much space remains. LikeLiked by 1 person Jeremy Horwitz - 2 years ago Reply See above. LikeLike stevelacey17 - 2 years ago Reply I looked at the new Photos app in Yosemite to see what it does with libraries from iPhoto and Aperture. The look is more like iPhoto but I felt I had less control over my organization of the individual photos themselves. Where I can place them within a group which I can do with Aperture but can’t with iPhoto unless I change a name or date or some other metadata that is listed in the menu for sorting. In Aperture I use a referenced library on an external drive so I can duplicate that drive for safety. Also, Aperture’s duplicate photos has other levels of the same photo including thumbs and duplicated images used for display when I want to view a larger version of the thumbnail. These could be the source for many duplicates that others are finding with these apps so viewing the data carefully for dimensions and files size is important. In iPhoto I have all my photos within the app library system. The reason for any permanent upgrade would be that it offers better organization and more adjustment controls. I thought “Photos” was going to have this. I was disappointed on both fronts. The adjustments on the right of the screen had such short lengths that using a slider approach was very coarse even if I could use the 1 click at a time while holding another key down. This defeats the purpose of easy use. It is still easier to find duplicates within Aperture with the simple find using specifics that are already included and combining them. Then by looking at the metadata on the left as I select the photos I can easily see which are duplicates or ones that are adjusted that I want to keep for a specific purpose. I can’t do that with “Photos”. Maybe, I have been using iPhoto and Aperture for such a long time ( since they first came out ) , I know them very well and can easily do whatever I need to do. But, even with that knowledge working with “Photos” is more UI unfriendly to get the refined result I am used to for adjustments or organizing. I am also afraid that it would be too easy to duplicate photos, at least in the beginning if I were to start using “Photos” with the cloud. My iPhone sharing would automatically be creating real duplicate files on 3 other devices and then I would have to individually shut down that feature so I wouldn’t go crazy if weeding out the duplicates on all those other streaming devices were to begin. Their new “convenient” feature for sharing photos has too many settings with all the other desktops and laptops that I might be using. So keeping it simple with 1 phone and 1 main central place and 1 main application is so much easier to archive and make safety duplicates using Carbon Copy Cloner so I know where all my photos are. The bottom line is that I am not going to upgrade to Yosemite for “Photos” and will keep Mountain Lion for Aperture and iPhoto when I need that app. I can still stream from my iPhone directly into Aperture through the cloud but nothing is stored on the cloud. Usually, I will just transfer the photos as I do with my Nikon directly to my library. Upgrading is not always the best way to be more efficient even if it has all those extra features that are supposed to make is easier in this new Cloud world we live in.

Disclaimer: I have no association of any kind with CrashPlan. And instead of that suggestion, you can certainly copy your photos to Box when they’re giving away 50 gigs, which I grabbed immediately.

From my point of view this is wrong, as always you would like to keep the oldest version if the quality is the same, as it is the most accurate reference of the date you actually took the picture. Their support is bad, only phone support based in India (the software is developed by a company sister or within a company called “The Phone Support”, they do not offer the possibility to send emails or contact form with print screens to show them what the problem is.

Android users have had a taste of the first generation, but Motorola’s new Moto 360 is one of the many new options available for both sides for the fence. The question is, should you give Motorola your money? If you’re not familiar with the first generation or Android Wear in general, you can check out our Moto 360 review here. This year Motorola has updated the internals to closely match the other smartwatch offerings on the market, but does it pack enough to win over the hearts of iPhone users? Like Apple, Motorola has two different sizes available for this year’s Moto 360. There’s a 42mm version which is the same as Apple’s largest offering and a slightly bigger 46mm version for those who prefer chunkier watches. Each model packs a 1.2GHz Snapdragon 400 quad-core processor, 4GB of storage, and 512MB of RAM. On the 42mm version there’s a 1.37-inch display with a 360×325 resolution, while the 46mm features a 1.56-inch display coming in at 360×330. In comparison, the 42mm Apple Watch’s 1.5-inch OLED display has a slightly higher pixel density with its 312×390 resolution. Both devices are water-resistant as well, which is definitely a must-have on any electronic device worn on your wrist. Activity tracking is available with heart rate sensors on each device and it’s safe to say you’ll get about a day’s worth of use on a full charge, though Motorola claims the Moto 360 will last up to 1.5 to 2 days depending on which size option you choose. Either way, expect to charge any of these watches at night. Check out our Moto 360 (2015) vs Apple Watch video below: Comparing the sizes, you’ll notice that the 46mm Moto 360 isn’t too much larger than the 42mm Apple Watch, but the difference is really present when worn on your wrist. I prefer the 42mm look of the Moto 360, but anything smaller than that would just look funny on my arm. When it comes to customization, the Moto 360 definitely wins. First off, it accepts any 22mm watch band with the new lugs that were added this time around, but with Apple you’ll need to stick to proprietary bands which can run you a bit of cash if you go with the official offerings. You can even take it a step further and completely customize the colors and variation of the Moto 360 using Moto Maker. For software customization, Apple may have the lead here. Both offer customized watch faces, but there’s a lot more to do (almost too much) with Apple’s watchOS interface than you’ll find on Android Wear. Android Wear’s simplicity may be seen as a positive aspect though depending on who you ask. You can also take phone calls and use Siri on the Apple Watch, while the Moto 360 will only respond to voice search and Google Now. With the Moto 360 your primary method of input is going to be the touch screen. Navigating through menus, apps, and more will all happen with a swipe of the finger, but you can use motion gestures with your wrist to flip through various notifications. On the Apple Watch, most navigation is done with the touch screen, but there’s also a Digital Crown on the side that will allow for scrolling and zoom in certain situations and a couple of buttons to perform various tasks, Unfortunately, the relocated button on the new Moto 360 will simply put the device to sleep when pressed, but again the entire story here is simplicity. If you’re only in need of notifications, it may be safer to stick with the Moto 360, but its $299 entry point for a base model may drive potential customers over to an Apple Watch for native support that starts at $349 for the Sport model. It’s nice to see Android Wear playing nicely with iOS, but there’s an obvious risk taken given that Google can only support so much without being able to tap into the full potential of iOS. At the end of the day, this choice comes down to personal preference, but if you’re aiming for simplicity it’s quite possible that you’ll be happy with the Moto 360 or any Android Wear offering that’s compatible with iOS. Which one do you prefer? Did Google’s latest Android Wear compatibility announcement change your mind about buying or keeping an Apple Watch? Obviously if you’re on Android, Apple Watch isn’t an option, but let us know what you think.

Also, is that the 22mm band or the 16mm “women’s” option? If it’s the 22mm, I think the size of the watch would look “off” compared to the band in the women’s option. Right now, if I were considering a watch other than the Apple Watch, I’d probably have to go with the Gear S2, assuming that Samsung eventually makes it work with iOS. It’s the only one that is using the round shape for a purpose (the rotating bezel), rather than just to make it look the same shape as an analog watch. As for customization, aren’t there some third party bands for the Apple Watch now? Some of them have adapters for using 22mm bands.

Terrible consistency. – The Moto 360’s flat tire cuts down usable screen area and it also looks bad chopping off the bottom of the screen. – The Gear S2 Tizen OS is more consistent/better looking than Android Wear but it hasn’t been released yet to check reliability and it’s not yet available for iOS. – Pebble has very slow customer service (a week + for a response) which is unacceptible to me. And the decent looking metal one, the Pebble Time Steel, has a small screen. – Finally, all 3rd party smartwatches for iOS will have only basic functions. No Apple Pay. No answering phone calls. As well as other limitations with using certain apps. – And the price of the new metal watches are getting close to the cost of an Apple Watch Sport. * If I’m going to pay ~$350 for a 3rd party watch (a Gear S2 for instance), why not spend $50 more and get a fully functional Apple Watch Sport? LikeLiked by 1 person dharrison9 - 1 year ago Reply Without the two pictures and one video, it would be easy to read this article and assume the writer had neither and Apple Watch nor a Moto 360. And here’s where 9to5Mac doesn’t seem to understand the Apple News threat. The “article” I should have read above should be titled, “Can you live with a smartwatch that isn’t Apple Watch?” After all, we’re on an Apple fanboy-website, or, at least, a website that caters to Apple supporters and/or product owners. A much more interesting review could be made about how the integration of non-Apple smartwatches leaves whatever price difference between a basic Sport and the competition is the cost of being able to answer a call in the shower or reply to a text from your wrist. The part of the article devoted to how the Apple Watch can take advantage of Siri, dictation, answering phone calls, third party apps, Glances, etc., is reduced to two sentences: ” You can also take phone calls and use Siri on the Apple Watch, while the Moto 360 will only respond to voice search and Google Now.” and, “It’s nice to see Android Wear playing nicely with iOS, but there’s an obvious risk taken given that Google can only support so much without being able to tap into the full potential of iOS.” Immediately following the last quote comes, “At the end of the day, this choice comes down to personal preference […]”. Really? Does anyone at 9to5Mac think that the choice between using an Android Wear smartwatch and an Apple Watch comes down to personal preference? It doesn’t eventually come down to a question of function, extensibility, HealthKit, WiFi, Bluetooth, FaceTime…? Does skipping Force Touch all together make this article any more complete in describing how input methods vary from watch to Watch? And lest we forget mentioning any other additional features that come with watchOS 2.0, probably coming next week. The author forgot. I look at the tiny amount of problems I have with this article and think of the many more I could type up if I could be bothered. The revelation comes in the fact that someone (editor) at 9to5Mac decided that printing (posting) this article was a good idea, and either didn’t bother to read it, or didn’t care about the missing focus, content or information and put it out anyway. So, who is this article for? The core readership knows that the Apple Watch is really the only viable option for a wearable if your on iOS. The competition is on borrowed time, because it takes one security measure or API change to make their watches unable to display notifications. The competition will never gain access to Siri or deep tasks because of the nature of writing programs for iOS (i.e. background processes). They’ll never be able to reply to a text, action a notification from an Apple application, use Apple Pay with your watch or perform many other tasks that we haven’t even thought of yet with ANY Android Wear watch. It’s that simple. You can buy a glorified notifications display for your wrist that can break with any Apple update (which usually hits at least 80% of the install base within a few months), or you can get the Apple Watch. That’s the core readership and the basics of what they should know. If they don’t know these facts, then this article helps them in no way further understand these basics. Which begs the question again, who is this article for? It’s neither informative nor interesting enough to be worth publicizing the publication with, so it must be click-bait. And that’s where the advertising and blockers and tracking that 9to5Mac went in depth about previously has left a more lasting mark on this entire generation of web publications. This article will rank highly on Google, and is most certainly SEO-optimized, but of what real value is it? No offense to the author, but it tells me nothing that reading either company’s product PR page wouldn’t have told me. Nothing about your experience comes out in the article. In fact, I have found it impossible to find the word ‘I’ in the article above. When Apple News comes around, do you think pollution like this will survive the cut, jockeying for space next to articles from The Verge, WIRED, et al at the top of my ‘For You’ tab? It’s not just 9to5Mac, but Engadget and the rest. A post of spec sheet comparisons or apes of press releases from Apple and the rest (this means liveblogs, too) will fall to the wayside as the official sources become contributors, as well. It will be original editorial content, meaningful reviews and in-depth news analysis that will allow web publications to survive the end that print journalists are facing. Only, it will happen much faster in digital. So, anyway. Android Wear, Pebble, and any emerging competitors are all fundamentally flawed and will never be able to compete with the Apple Watch. It’s easy. If you buy a smartwatch, chances are, a friend of yours has one, too. When you meet and compare, there are three possibilities if you have an iPhone and a smartwatch that is not an Apple Watch. Your friend has an Android phone and an Android Wear watch. He shows you how powerful integration is and how much better the experience is when both OSes are created by the same company. Your friend has an iPhone and an Apple Watch. He shows you the very same thing: a much better experience when both OSes are created by the same company. He also shows you a relatively simple pricing structure and easy to find customization options for the Apple Watch. Or, finally, your friend has the same set up as yourself with an iPhone and an Android Wear watch. You confirm to each other how great it is, while lamenting that you don’t have the integration that comes with having both phone and watch OSes created by the same company. It becomes a really easy choice: Apple Watch if you have an iPhone, Android Wear if you have an Android phone. That’s my opinion, of course.

It was spun out of Stanford Research Institute in 2007 and funded with $25 million from Morgenthaler and Menlo Ventures. The startup was named Siri. According to his LinkedIn profile, Kittlaus helped launch “the first true automated Virtual Personal Assistant for mobile devices”. The deal, estimated at about $200 million, eventually came through and turned Kittlaus, a former Motorola executive, and other co-founders into millionaires. Following the acquisition, Kittlaus and Co. moved to Apple’s Cupertino headquarters. Eighteen months later, in October 2011, Kittlaus quit Apple and is currently writing a novel, a futuristic techno-drama, and brewing new projects on his kitchen counter. He is also helping kids with problems at home and their parents who cannot help children with their homework. Kittlaus would know – he worked day and night for four years on Siri. So, what was going through Kittlaus’s head when he realized Apple’s mercurial boss was on the line? More on that and the origins of the Siri name below the fold. Of the phone call from Apple, Kittlaus said (pardon our machine-translated quote): Of course it was a great moment when Steve Jobs called and wanted to buy my company. It was surreal. When I heard that it was him, I knew we had made it big. In advance, we were pretty confident that the technology we had developed was so startling that we would get some kind of breakthrough. Steve was the first caller. Siri in Norwegian means “beautiful victorious counselor”. Urban legend has it that Kittlaus named the Siri app after the famous Norwegian meteorologist and business woman Siri Kalvig, with whom he had worked during his tenure at Telenor, a Norwegian telecommunications company, while she worked for meteorologist company Storm. “It was a good collaboration, because I am a total weather freak”, he said. In reality, Kittlaus wanted to name his daughter Siri, but he got son so he instead named his company Siri .“Our first child was going to be named Siri, but then we got Markus”. Despite living in a beautiful brand-new villa in a suburb of Chicago, funded by Apple’s cash, Kittlaus said he realized during his tenure at Apple that money and profit is not what drives the California consumer electronics giant: “It is the desire to create a fantastic product.” His reaction to Steve Jobs’s death (again, machine-translated)? Well, my strongest reaction came when I realized how sick he was, that he had not long to live. […] My reaction to that was a lot stronger than I was prepared, it put me out properly. He is the inventor in history that changed the most, dozens of industries around the world is turned upside down. By the way, we’d be grateful if our Norwegian readers helped us out with accurate translation of the quoted parts. 0.000000 0.000000 Guides AAPL Company Breaking news from Cupertino.

Iris Goodbye - 3 years ago Reply Dag Kittlaus doesn’t realize that he made technology turn into a bully for all the other realistic Siris out there.

You can’t make money on AI robots if you eradicate all humans. Consumer spending (GDP) is what fuel all markets.

I purchased the initial iPad Pro back in November when it first came out, but sold it and switched to the 9.7-inch model last week, and so far I’ve been very happy with that choice. Figuring that I’ll probably stick with this size iPad Pro for at least a year, I decided the Apple Pencil would be a worthwhile investment. And I was right. I was skeptical of the Apple Pencil when it was first announced, as I assumed it would just be the same as the tacky styluses third-parties had been making for years, but after using it I’ve realized just how wrong I was. The thing that I noticed very early on in my time with the Apple Pencil though, was how crazy good the palm rejection is. Writing with an Apple Pencil on an iPad Pro is nearly as easy as writing on actual paper. As a student, this is a huge factor for me when it comes to note taking, so I decided to dive a little deeper into the apps on iOS that are made for taking notes and are optimized for iPad Pro. Here are some of the ones I would recommend… GoodNotes 4 GoodNotes is an app that I wasn’t entirely familiar with until I purchased my iPad Pro and Apple Pencil, but I’ve quickly realized that it’s one of, if not the most, complete note taking apps available in the App Store. You have the ability to create multiple notebooks – like one for each class or subject – and then create individual pages within each notebook with varying page styles. There’s also the ability to insert charts and images which definitely comes in handy. GoodNotes also indexes your notes so you can quickly search them. I have pretty awful handwriting, but it was still able to correctly index my notes and allow me to search through them when I needed to. It also supports the Apple Pencil for pressure sensitive writing, something that really comes in handy while taking extensive amounts of notes at a time. To me, GoodNotes 4 felt most similar to traditional notebooks when it came to taking notes. It really felt like writing with pen and paper, just modernized with many new features. GoodNotes 4 is available for $7.99 on the App Store and is definitely worth it. GoodNotes 4 – $7.99 Notability Notability and GoodNotes are very similar apps on the surface, and if anything, Notability feels slightly more polished and easier to use than GoodNotes. It offers many of the same features as other handwriting apps, including palm-rejection, pressure sensitivity detection, and the ability to insert images, charts, and even full webpages. That last feature is notable as it means you can import a webpage and highlight and mark it up as you go, something that’s important for working through research projects and the like. One thing that’s unfortunately missing and that will ultimately force me to stick with GoodNotes, however, is the ability to search handwritten notes. While you can search PDF text, any notes you write by hand are not capable of being searched. On the bright side though, Notability is currently 33 percent off on the App Store, making it just $3.99 as of this post. Notability – $3.99 Notes Plus Notes Plus is another solid note taking app with iPad Pro and Apple Pencil optimizations. In addition to standard features like PDF and image support, folder management, and shape detection, Notes Plus includes a few standout features. For one, it supports a built-in browser for quickly and easily looking up facts and statistics. Additionally, it supports the ability to covert handwritten notes to text. This means that any handwritten notes are also searchable and later annotatable, unlike with Notability. There’s also support for recording background audio. For instance, if you’re in a lecture, you can be recording that lecture directly into the app so you can later go back and listen to it to ensure you didn’t miss anything. Notes Plus is currently 30 percent off in the App Store, making it $6.99 as of this past. Notes Plus – $6.99 Noteshelf In terms of pure writing experience, Noteshelf offers one of the smoothest experiences of any of these apps. The app supports the Apple Pencil and offers integration with Spotlight on iOS so you can quickly find different documents and notebooks. Unfortunately, there’s no way to search within handwritten notes like with Penultimate and GoodNotes. One nice feature of Noteshelf, however, is that you can add a passcode to protect important and sensitive notes, much like what Apple added to its Notes app with iOS 9.3. Noteshelf prides itself as the best note-taking app that offers the most beautiful handwriting effect – this is one of the key reasons why our users fall in love with Noteshelf. It perfectly mimics that intuitive ink-on-paper feeling so smoothly, it’s as if you’re using a real pen and paper. Noteshelf is available for $7.99 on the App Store. Noteshelf – $7.99 Evernote Evernote isn’t the most feature-rich app when it comes to using the Apple Pencil for note taking, but if you already use Evernote across other devices, it’s nice to stay in the same ecosystem. The stylus can be used for essentially handwriting notes in the most basic format. Evernote is more reasonable to use if you’re typing notes and need to quickly sketch a chart or a diagram. For use cases like this, Evernote’s “Snap to Shape” feature is useful. The biggest selling point of Evernote is its cross-platform availability, so if you’re often switching between devices and operating systems for taking notes, then Evernote might be your best bet. It’s available on the App Store for free with various premium upgrades. Evernote – Free Penultimate Made by Evernote, Penultimate is the company’s more advanced take on a handwriting app. Penultimate features a distraction-free interface that makes it easy to quickly and easily take down notes without accidentally changing settings or navigating away from the writing interface. The app is optimized for iPad Pro, as well, which means that it supports pressure sensitivity, so you can push harder for thicker lettering and lighter for more faint writing. Furthermore, and perhaps most notably, Penultimate analyzes your handwritten notes and allows you to search for handwritten text in the app. Penultimate is free with a host of in-app purchases to improve your experience. Penultimate – Free Apple Notes You can’t discuss note taking apps without mentioning Apple’s own Notes app that comes pre-installed on every iOS device. Prior to iOS 9, Apple’s Notes app was pretty lackluster in comparison to many note taking apps on iOS. With the new operating system, however, the app is gaining on third-party solutions. It still doesn’t support things like searching notes or even different page styles, but it’s improving. There are however, new features such as additional font formatting options, support for inline checklists, and link thumbnail + textual previews. Wrap-up Ultimately the moral of the story here is that the Apple Pencil and iPad Pro have convinced me that the iPad is now a viable way to quickly take notes in a variety of settings. Whether it be in meetings or in class, the Apple Pencil and iPad Pro paired with any of these apps makes for a note taking experience equivalent to that of pen and paper. Personally, after trying all of these apps, I think GoodNotes 4 is the most solid choice for iPad Pro note taking. Its amazing handwriting recognition and search feature really sets it apart from the competition. For someone with awful handwriting, I didn’t think a feature like that would ever work for me.

Actually the Apple wizards should have figured out a way to house the pencil in the tablet. I can’t be the only person on the planet that thinks this way. When Samsung had the Note Tablet each one was built this way and the price reflected what you got. Even the Samsung Note from the very beginning had the S-Pen built into the phone. Apple can make a $400 phone just as fast as a $650 one but they can’t include the Pencil in a tablet priced $100 more than the non-pro models? Who’s making these silly decisions?

The pencil is capable of sensing the pressure and doing #D Touch gestures using the Pencil. Apple wants to advertise it as a PC replacement it should come with the pencil or smart keyboard.

Instead of reaching into your pocket or bag for your wallet, and extracting the card you want to use, you can simply double-click the side button on the Watch and hold out your wrist. But there’s one aspect of Apple Pay that I’ve always felt fails to get the full attention it deserves: the fact that it never hands over your card details to retailers. Even on Apple’s own microsite, the feature is buried in a paragraph whose heading is about the use of fingerprints. Yet the list of major chains who have seen customer card details compromised is virtually a Who’s Who of retailing and the hotel trade. Acer, Carphone Warehouse, CVS Photo, Eddie Bauer, Hilton, Home Depot, K-Mart, Marriott Hotels, Michaels, Neiman Marcus, P.F. Chang’s, Staples, Starwood Hotels, SuperValu, Target, Trump Hotels and Wendy’s. That’s even before we get into the Oracle hack that may have exposed almost every US credit card …  Nor is having your card and personal details exposed a trivial matter. Banks may guarantee to refund fraudulent transactions, but anyone who has their name, address and date of birth taken alongside card details – which has been the case in several of the hacks – is at risk of falling victim to identity theft. Identify theft is a huge deal. In one well-known account, the victim not only saw more than $50,000 worth of fraudulent transactions charged to her, but the false details used resulted in an arrest warrant and criminal record for drug trafficking when a criminal successfully used her identity all the way through to sentencing. One survey revealed that the average time spent by victims resolving the problem is more than 300 hours. Against this background, it surprises me that Apple doesn’t make much more of the fact that your card details are never revealed when you use Apple Pay. Here’s the text on Apple’s site that you’d never find just from the headings. Every time you hand over your credit or debit card to pay, your card number and identity are visible, and swiping your card triggers an exchange of information. With Apple Pay, instead of using your actual credit and debit card numbers when you add your card, a unique Device Account Number is assigned, encrypted and securely stored in the Secure Element, a dedicated chip in iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch. When you make a purchase, the Device Account Number, along with a transaction-specific dynamic security code, is used to process your payment. So your actual credit or debit card numbers are never shared by Apple with merchants or transmitted with payment. To make this crystal clear, a unique code is generated for every single Apple Pay transaction you make. Effectively, Apple creates fake card details for you and hands those over to the retailer instead of the real ones. As soon as that transaction is complete, the code is automatically voided – it can never again be used for a purchase. Which means that if a retailer is hacked, and your ‘card details’ are exposed, those details are useless. They aren’t your actual card numbers, and they cannot be used for even a single additional transaction. Indeed, once you’ve registered a card, the real details aren’t even stored on your iPhone or Watch. Your underlying Visa credit and debit card numbers are not stored on any device running Apple Pay, or on Apple servers. As with many Apple products and services, the company didn’t invent the Device Account Number technology; Visa did. Apple did what the company is famous for: take an existing technology, and make it really easy to use. But with payment tokenisation, Apple has almost done too good a job of making it invisible to users. The average non-tech user (and even some tech ones) are completely unaware how the service works, meaning they don’t appreciate the full benefit of using Apple Pay. I said at the outset that Apple Pay is more convenient than using a card, and that’s true when using an Apple Watch. It’s arguably not true when using an iPhone. In my wallet, for example, I keep my most-used contactless card in a flap on one side of the wallet, away from my other cards. To make a contactless payment, I can just open my wallet and hold that flap against the card-reader: no need to remove a card. Compare that to the effort involved in getting my phone from my wallet and putting my thumb on the Home button and there’s honestly nothing in it. But the reason I’d continue to use Apple Pay even if I didn’t own a Watch is precisely because it doesn’t expose my card details. Indeed, one time when I forgot to put my watch on, I used my iPhone to buy train tickets even though I was going to put them into the wallet I needed to pull out anyway. Apple Pay is not just more convenient, it’s vastly safer than using a physical card – and that’s something Apple really ought to make a whole lot less of a secret. Guides Apple Pay Apple Pay is Apple's mobile payments solution first introduced in 2014.

Recode, citing industry sources, says Amazon wants to launch two music subscription services next month. One of them would cost $10 month, in the similar vein of Spotify and Apple (AAPL) Music (i.e. ad-free streaming whenever you want, play anywhere, download and listen offline). The other, cheaper subscription -- possibly only costing $4 or $5 per month -- would also be ad-free and on-demand. But there's a catch: It would only work on Amazon's Echo player. Recode notes this is against typical strategies for the music industry. Most Spotify subscribers use phones to sign up and Apple Music honed in on iPhone users for its launch, later also targeting Android phone users. The retail giant is confident in the Echo, according to The Information, and looking to expand upon its inaugural year of reportedly 1 million devices sold the second half of last year following a greater U.S. rollout. In 2016, it's aiming for 3 million, with 10 million come 2017. With Amazon's staggering ambitions evident across its platforms -- Amazon Prime, Amazon Web Services and shipping plans, just to name a few -- it still has to prove worthy of its pricier stock (aka profitability can't falter). Though its earnings and revenue blew past expectations in its latest quarter, even that wasn't enough to make Wall Street sweet on the company. If this cheaper service does come to fruition, it would have to greatly move Echo sales and in turn contribute to strong profit for the company to exceed investors' high expectations. Amazon's stock is up about 12.4 percent on the year, and was up 0.6 percent in Tuesday morning trading.

But even though multi-touch in iOS gave us an iconic Steve Jobs quote, sometimes scrolling back to the top of a long webpage, document, or list can be a pain in the butt, no matter how pretty it looks. It turns out, however, that Apple long ago introduced a way to avoid these frustrating moments of seemingly endless scrolling. Mac Geek Gab listener Scott stopped by to remind us of this neat little shortcut that many iOS users have overlooked: a quick tap at the top of the screen. To try this out, first grab your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch. Next, open an app with a scrolling page, such as a website, list of Mail messages, or a long document. Swipe as you normally would to scroll down a bit. It doesn’t matter if you scroll to the very end of the page or just somewhere in the middle; this tip works no matter how far you’ve scrolled. Tap once at the very top of the screen to scroll all the way back to the beginning. When you’re ready to return to the top of the page, tap once at the very top of the screen. If you tapped the correct location, iOS will quickly zap you to the very top of the page. Tapping at the top of the screen takes you back to the beginning of the page or document. The usefulness of this feature is obviously limited for shorter documents or pages. If you memorize this function and use it regularly, however, there’s no telling how much time you’ll save by not having to stand there on the subway platform frantically swiping up to get back to a website’s navigation menu or see your newest emails. As mentioned, this feature isn’t new, and has been part of iOS for years. But, to dredge up and paraphrase the slogan from a failing network’s golden age: if you didn’t know about it, it’s new to you! Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Reddit Tags: iOS, iPhone, Safari, Web Browser 5 Comments Add a comment Lee Dronick August 23, 2016 Jim, is there way to jump to the bottom of the page? August 23, 2016 at 8:03 EST AM geoduck August 23, 2016 THANK YOU Apparently I’ve used this a lot. Often I’ll be reading a page and it would suddenly zoom to the top. I’d lose my spot, and have to scroll all the way back down. Or I’d try to show someone something and when I’d hand it to them it would be gone and screen would be at the top of the page. “No, really, this is really cool, hang on while I find it again.” This has been pissing me off for ages but I never knew why it kept happening. Now I know what to watch out for. August 23, 2016 at 8:13 EST AM gwbeckett August 23, 2016 re: “If you tapped the correct location, iOS will quickly zap you to the very top of the page” …. For me, tapping where the time is displayed is the right spot to zoom-scroll up to the top of the page. August 23, 2016 at 11:55 EST AM Paul Goodwin August 23, 2016 This really is a handy feature of iOS. Haha geoduck. I did the same thing and finally had the revelation of “hey, it always scrolls to the top when I hit it up there.” August 23, 2016 at 11:14 EST PM Steven Strell August 24, 2016 An important thing to note, which I’m really surprised is not mentioned here, is that not all apps support this shortcut (which is really stupid, but that’s life).

Wccftech News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Rumor iPhone 8 ‘Special Edition’ Could Also Come With a Curved Edge Display By Omar Sohail Posted Aug 22, 2016 28Shares Share Tweet Submit We previously reported that the upcoming iPhone 8 will be released in a Special Edition variant, and this particular one was going to feature all the goodies that would eclipse its counterparts. Now, according to the latest report, there could be few other perks of owning the Special Edition of the smartphone, and you are going to find out about it shortly. The Special Edition of iPhone 8 Could Also Come With a Curved Edge Display to Rival That of Samsung’s Galaxy Note 7 According to the latest report, 2017 is going to be the magical year when Apple will be celebrating 10 years when the very first iPhone came into the existence and the era of the touchscreen smartphone was finally crafted. With the release of iPhone 8, Apple intends on releasing a Special Edition of the smartphone, most likely to commemorate the 10th year anniversary of the smartphone lineup. This Special Edition is going to be comprised up of an OLED panels, and seeing its numerous benefits would overshadow existing smartphone display technologies, it would be the best possible choice for the company. It’s also been rumored that the Special Edition of iPhone 8 will feature a massive 5.8-inch display, showing that the company could move out of its comfort zone as far as the screen size is concerned. The larger screen size will give Apple more freedom to increase the battery capacity, and we honestly hope that the tech giant pools in resources to increase the battery life rather than figure out absurd ways to reduce the overall thickness of the handset. The curved OLED panel could show apps on the side, with users negating the use of entering the app menu as a result of this addition. Furthermore, with TSMC ramping up production of its 10nm FinFET node, A11 being processed on a smaller manufacturing process is also highly possible, resulting in more performance, and a higher transistor count that will lead to better battery life. Advertisement For A12 however, it looks like a different technique called multi-patterning lithography is going to be used for the 7nm process, but because it’s too early to dictate this due to manufacturing limitations, we’ll comment on this when more progress has been made.

It’s been more than four years since Frank Ocean released “Channel Orange,” his critically adored major label debut. Since then, the wait for a follow-up has felt every bit that long, and then some.   As anticipation heightened, so did the drama and anxiety — there were phony release dates, promising snippets of new music and even a mysterious, black and white live stream of a vague, warehouse workspace. Every move Ocean made felt so large, as fans tried to read into every little detail, speculating, hoping and doubting all at once as more and more time passed by.   That all changed last Thursday night, when the enigmatic singer revealed “Endless,” a full-length visual album featuring totally new music and some strange — yet somehow incredibly artful — woodworking. Then, less than two days later, fans received “Nikes,” a music video for yet another new track. Things were happening so fast. Finally, Ocean topped off the weekend with “Blonde,” a new record that seemed to be the real album, the one fans had waited so long for. The 17-song LP, released exclusively on Apple Music Aug. 20, finds the Los Angeles-based artist trying to reconcile the effects of his fans’ monstrous expectations with his goals as a creator, taking the hype head-on while also shifting his focus as an artist. pic.twitter.com/9cv9b0j9re— Frank Ocean Daily (@TeamFrankDaily) August 23, 2016 Musically, the album quickly demonstrates just how much Ocean’s tastes have changed in the last four years. Ballads reign supreme on “Blonde,” and most tracks find the R&B singer crooning over minimal, low-tempo instrumentation with little to no backbeat. Drums are notably absent at many points throughout the record, as Ocean seems more concerned with emphasizing his excellent voice rather than building beats to a climax. While the smooth, catchy drum beats of “Channel Orange” songs such as “Lost” and “Crack Rock” are nowhere to be found on “Blonde,” tracks such as “Ivy” and “Skyline To” find ways to escalate on their own. Despite such a simple musical focus, the record’s style differs wildly from song to song. Ocean moves listeners through an electronic anthem on “Nights,” jazz guitar-fueled soul on “Self Control" and futuristic, dream pop on “White Ferrari.” “Meant it sincere back then, we had time to kill back then. You ain't a kid no more, we'll never be those kids again. It's not the same." -Frank Ocean on "Ivy"  Ocean’s lyrical intentions have clearly developed as well, with “Channel Orange’s” themes of love, lust and wealth being traded in for a more introspective, autobiographical tone. On “Blonde,” the New Orleans-raised musician dwells on his past often, and embraces loneliness and longing as primary subjects. No track displays this better than “Solo,” in which Ocean beautifully toys with the duality of being “solo” as well as feeling “so low.” He somberly searches for companionship, singing, “I brought trees to blow through, but it's just me and no you. Stayed up 'til my phone died, smoking big, rolling solo.” That being said, Ocean understands his rather particular situation, and seems aware that taking himself too seriously after a four year hiatus would leave fans feeling looked down on. As a result, humor often steps in to lighten the album’s mood, providing a light break from its heavier moments. On “Nikes,” the record’s first song, Ocean describes women that are “Looking for a check” and “Need a ring like Carmelo (Anthony),” comparing sports with a person’s need for financial security. The track comes across as both humorous and perceptive, and ultimately is one of the “Blonde’s” strongest songs. Additionally, a much-welcomed appearance by Outkast member and Atlanta hip-hop legend Andre 3000 also serves to break up the album’s bleak tone. Appearing — quite fittingly — by himself without Ocean’s accompaniment on the interlude track “Solo (Reprise),” the famously mysterious rapper is fast and harsh in his delivery, a welcomed pause in between a slew of slower songs. Overall, “Blonde” doesn’t live up to the legend of its predecessor, but Ocean still manages to quell the concerns of a sophomore slump, which were likely only multiplied as the album faced so many delays and false releases. He gives his fans just enough to run with, while also making it evident that the sounds that made “Channel Orange” so popular are no longer in his line of sight. Frank Ocean is growing and changing and his next work may look even less like “Blonde” or “Endless.” In the meantime, however, both Ocean and his fans are just happy an album, especially one this emotional, beautiful and innovative, has finally arrived — it’s been long enough after all.  Reptar performs electrifying set at 40 Watt Athens’ locals Reptar returned to the 40 Watt on Friday night, providing high-energy and crowd-pleasers throughout the evening.

According to a report from Recode, Amazon has plans to roll out two brand new streaming services as early as September. While one service would effectively be similar to what’s already available — unlimited on-demand streaming for $10/month — the other has the potential to be a real game changer. Citing sources purportedly familiar with Amazon’s plans, the online retail giant is prepping a music service that would drastically undercut Spotify and Apple Music. If you thought $10 for all you can eat streaming was a great deal, how does $4 or $5 sound? DON’T MISS: The holy grail: Hack Pokemon Go so you can walk anywhere, no jailbreak required It sounds delightfully crazy, but Jeff Bezos and co. haven’t gotten to where they are now by making boneheaded business decisions, save for the ill-fated Fire Phone. The catch is that Amazon’s more affordable streaming service would only be available to Amazon Echo owners. Interestingly, this strategy closely resembles what Apple tried and failed to do with Apple Music — reduce the monthly subscription price in an effort to drive hardware sales. The lower-priced service would represent a novel approach. Other services have tried, without success, to offer subscriptions in the $5 range. But those have usually been variants of web radio services, which don’t let users play any song they want, whenever they want. … Amazon’s discount service would be different, industry sources say, because it would work like Spotify or Apple Music — unlimited, ad-free music on demand — but it would be constrained to Amazon’s Echo player, and wouldn’t work on phones. The underlying question here is if Amazon can convince record labels to hop on board. If you recall, Apple famously encountered heavy resistance when it tried to price Apple Music in the $7-$8 range, which makes Amazon’s goal to cut the typical streaming rate in half all the more intriguing.

It has even changed the name of this app. The new application comes with several features, enhancements as well as overall visual and stability improvements. It puts the spotlight on being able to track runs from Apple Watch which is interesting given that Apple is expected to launch a new Apple Watch in the near future. The app is now called Nike+ Run Club and it comes with a new user interface. Users will find it quick and easy to access important information like run time, location, and distance. It also has many post-run sharing options to offer a connected fitness experience with friends and family. Nike+ Run Club does feature integration with Apple Watch. It can currently track elevation, distance, heart rate, pace, and mile splits. However, given that the next Apple Watch is expected to feature a built-in GPS, the app will then also be able to track the location of the run by using the smartwatch’s GPS. It also provides access to multiple personalised coaching plans which start with their goals in mind as well as their fitness level and adapts as they progress. Nike+ Run Club is live now and available as a free download from the App Store. Filed in Cellphones. Read more about Apple Watch, Apps and nike.

All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. NEW YORK (CNNMoney) Tim Cook will mark his five-year anniversary as the CEO of Apple by doing something that his predecessor Steve Jobs typically avoided: hosting a fundraiser for a presidential candidate. On Wednesday, Cook and Lisa Jackson, Apple's head of environmental initiatives, will host an event in California to raise money for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. Those invited have reportedly been asked to contribute as much as $50,000. Cook is just the latest in a growing list of tech executives and venture capitalists working to raise big money to help Clinton beat Donald Trump, who has repeatedly attacked tech companies and opposes the industry on key issues like immigration and trade. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, Google CFO Ruth Porat, Zynga chairman Mark Pincus, Napster founder Sean Parker, SolarCity CEO (and Elon Musk's cousin) Lyndon Rive and LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman have all contributed or raised at least $100,000 for Clinton's bid. That's according to a lengthy list of top fundraisers, dubbed "Hillblazers," put out by the campaign. The list also includes tech investors like Brook Byers, a founding partner of Kleiner Perkins, and Chamath Palihapitiya, an early Facebook exec. Even Laurene Powell Jobs, the widow of Apple's late apolitical founder, is there. Trump's campaign has yet to release a comparable list of bundlers, but broader data on campaign contributions for this election shows a wide gap in the tech industry's financial support. "Clinton has raised far more than Trump from the tech industry -- around $4 million, compared to just a tiny fraction of that for Trump," says Sheila Krumholz, executive director at the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks money in politics. How much is a "tiny fraction" of tech funding? Just shy of $200,000. Chris Sacca, an early investor in Twitter, Instagram and Uber and one of the Hillblazers, ticked off a long list of reasons why Trump has turned off the tech industry and business in general. They include, in no particular order: Trump's threatening to default on U.S. debt; Trump pledging to pull out of international trade deals; Trump's plans to make it harder for companies to hire foreign workers; and Trump repeatedly denying the science behind climate change. "The list is so long, I have no doubt I am leaving out another half dozen reasons for why his support in the tech and entrepreneurial community hovers within reaching distance of zero percent," Sacca wrote in an email to CNNMoney. "But the takeaway is clear: a Donald Trump presidency would be bad for business." Data from Crowdpac released in early June found that just 52 tech industry workers had made political contributions to Trump, while more than 2,000 gave money to Clinton. (Bernie Sanders beat both with more than 33,000 donors in the industry.) That gaping disparity is particularly clear when looking at contributions from employees at specific tech companies. At Apple, for example, employees gave $156,893 to Clinton's campaign through the end of June, according to CRP's data. By comparison, Trump's campaign received just $665 from the group. Cook has personally given $2,700 to Paul Ryan, the Republican speaker of the House, and hosted a fundraiser for him -- but has done nothing for Trump, who called for a boycott of Apple products. "There's not much momentum for Trump. Silicon Valley knows the difference between disruption and destruction," says Tucker Bounds, a former Facebook communications director and staffer for John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign. "The disparity between this election and those past for the GOP nominee in the Valley is unmistakable," says Bounds, who now runs Sidewire, an app for chatting with experts about the day's news. In 2012, President Barack Obama raised more than $12 million from the tech industry, narrowly beating out the $10 million and change raised by his opponent, Mitt Romney, according to CRP. "(Clinton) has her work cut out for her to match Obama's $12 million haul in 2012, or even Romney's $10 million," says Krumholz. "Then again, a single megadonor to her super PAC could accomplish that." Trump, on the other hand, may have no chance to catch up in this particular race.

It changed the name after Apple Music was launched to Apple Music Festival. The company has confirmed that the 10th Anniversary Apple Music Festival is going to take place next month. It’s going to run for nearly two weeks at the Roundhouse in London, United Kingdom. The announcement was made via Apple’s Beats 1 radio station on its music streaming service. The company is yet to reveal the artists who will be performing at the 10th Anniversary Apple Music Festival live. Apple is going to provide live and on-demand streaming of the acts via Apple Music to those who can not be in London to attend the live sessions. Apple is going to reveal more information about the event and confirm the acts over the coming days through Twitter, Snapchat, and Beats 1 Radio. Applications have not be opened as yet but true to tradition, Apple is going to provide free tickets to randomly selected residents of the UK. Last year, the Apple Music Festival featured performances by some of the biggest names in music, including but not limited to Pharrell Williams, The Weeknd, Carrie Underwood, and more. The 10th Anniversary Apple Music Festival is going to take place in London from September 18th to September 30th at the Roundhouse. Filed in Apple. Read more about apple music.

TrustedReviews Facebook Twitter Googleplus TVs & Audio Cameras Computing Mobile Home appliances Gaming Black Friday Deals Desktop PCs Internet Laptops Monitors PC Components Peripherals More Printers Software Trending: Black Friday Deals Apple Watch 2 iPhone 7 Galaxy S7 vs iPhone 6S Google Pixel Galaxy S7 Home / Opinions / Internaut Day: A brief history of the internet in 9 websites Internaut Day: A brief history of the internet in 9 websites by Joe Roberts 23 August 2016 0 shares Read Comments Internaut Day: We take a look back at the history of our beloved internet to see how nine great websites appeared back in the day. It's Internaut day, and unlike most dodgy-sounding modern celebrations, this one isn't entirely made up. 25 years ago today, the father of the internet, Tim Berners-Lee, first allowed public access to the World Wide Web, and a revolution begun. Of course, we can't have a celebration without an adequately tortured portmanteau, and this particular occasion pairs the word 'internet' with the word 'astronaut' for some reason. Something to do with people venturing into unknown territory or, whatever, it sounds good. And we at TrustedReviews owe Mr Berners-Lee a huge debt – for, were it not for him, we would not be here to provide you with our trusted advice on tech. We therefore thought we'd repay the old lion with a list we slapped together of pictures of old websites. Mr Berners-Lee, we salute you! Related: iPhone 7 1) Amazon (1995 to present) Here's a good'un. Amazon has basically become a synonym for online shopping these days, but when it first launched in 1995, it looked more like some dodgy website for a new-age health centre. Founder Jeff Bezos decided to name his website Amazon after the world's largest river, apparently to reflect his desire for the site to become the biggest seller of books – hence the weird MS Paint logo. 2) AltaVista (1995 to 2013) The site as it appeared in 1997 Gather round kids, and I'll tell you a tale of an age before Google. Once upon a time, the kingdom of the internet had more than one search engine. It was an exciting time as the likes of Webcrawler and Lycos battled for supremacy. But one brave contender in particular remains in the hearts and minds of those old enough to remember when the great search engine wars were raging: AltaVista. Founded the same year as Bezos unleashed Amazon on the world, AltaVista was eventually bought by Yahoo in 2013, which decided to do what it does best and close it down that same year. It had a good run, but like so many other search engines, it just couldn't compete with the big G. 3) Apple (1997 to present, domain registered 1987) The site as it appeared in 1997 Today's Apple.com is a decidedly minimalist affair, with beautiful shots of the company's products sliding in and out of view and a general commitment to sleek and refined aesthetics. Now, take a look at where it all started. The above image shows the site as it was in 1997, which, according to the Internet Archive, is around when Apple.com went live. And it's a long way off today's offering, with an interesting arrangement of clip art and a mish mash of colours. Oh, and take a look at that advert for Mac OS 8 if you want to feel all nostalgic – *wipes away tear* that OS looked as crap as this website. 4) Facebook (2004 to present) The site as it looked in 2004 You already know the story of this one – started as a university thing at Harvard then went on to subsume seemingly the entire human race. This shot of the original 2004 site really is a fascinating article. Back then, it seems the company prepended an imperious 'the' to the beginning of its name, which appears alongside a rather ominous looking tech dude at the top of the page. There's also a lot of mid 2000's design classics going on here – brackets around words that don't need them and all that. And although today's Facebook is a much slicker affair, we'd welcome the return of that creepy guy in the top left, if only to put us off scrolling through our despair-inducing timelines. 5) Twitter (2006 to present) The website as it appears in 2006 Before it became known as the place to go to get trolled online, Twitter launched with a charmingly simple home page, as shown in the image above. There were no hashtags back then, and even the concept of a Twitter rant was but a gleam in the eye of awful people everywhere. But, as Jacob and Candice demonstrate, the updates were no less dull. Hope you managed to sort the issue with Frank, Cand. 6) Geocities (1994 to 2009) The site as it appeared in 1996 Back in the day, if you needed to host a website, Geocities, with its free web hosting services, was the place to go. Founded as Beverly Hills Internet in 1994 and bought by Yahoo in 1999, the site was once the third most-visited domain. Geocities was shuttered in 2009, but for some reason, Japan got to keep its service. We like the vibe of Geocities' site circa 1996 – a lot of energy and an advert for someone calling themselves a Neanderthal advice columnist. What more do you need? 7) Lycos (1994 to present, no really) The site as it appeared in 1996 Another search engine that eventually fell to the mighty Google, Lycos was once the most visited site online. It was conceived at Carnegie Mellon University as a way of calculating the size of the web using something called a "spider" robot program, but eventually was turned into a web portal and search engine. The site grew rapidly in the 1990s, but by 2004 Lycos' market share had shrunk significantly. But the site is still going, along with its trademark black lab branding. If you're looking for an alternative to Google, which we're sure you are, then give the old site a try. 8) Google (1997 to present) The site as it appeared in 1999 What can be said of Google that hasn't already been covered. Not a lot, so here's a picture of how it looked in 1999 instead. It's actually not all that different to today's Google homepage – a tribute to the company's commitment to effective design. The site was originally live at google.stanford.edu, where founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin met. The pair registered the google.com domain in 1997 and the site went on to rule the world. 9) Trusted Reviews (2003 to present) The site as it appeared in 2005 We couldn't finish this list without giving you a taste of some classic TR. We've come a long way since this rather sparse homepage design from 2005, but the colours are kind of the same. We're glad we weren't founded earlier than 2003 too, otherwise the image above might look a lot more like Apple's clip art-fest from 1997. Though, we can't help but notice that image for the PC water cooling roundup... It was 2005, guys. For shame.

It may also unveil an updated Apple Watch among other products. Here’s a look at what we may see from this year’s iPhone — likely to be called the iPhone 7 — based on the latest rumors and reports. September launch Apple typically releases its new iPhones in September, and it seems like this year will be no different. The Cupertino, Calif.-based company is holding an invitation-only event on Sept. 7 at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco, which is where it debuted the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus last year. Bloomberg previously reported that Apple will unveil its new iPhones on that day, while VentureBeat’s Evan Blass reports that the phones will be available for purchase on Sept. 16. It’s possible that this date may be pushed back to Sept. 23, as suggested by a supposedly leaked AT&T retail schedule published by 9to5Mac. No headphone jack Apple is expected to take the controversial step of removing the headphone jack from the iPhone 7, as reports from The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg have indicated. This alteration is said to make the next iPhone slimmer and more water resistant, though critics have colored the move as consumer-unfriendly. Since Apple typically includes a pair of earbuds with each new iPhone, it’s possible we’ll see a pair of headphones that plug into the phone’s Lightning port, or a wireless pair of earbuds, ship with the iPhone 7. One report suggests Apple may introduce a set of wireless earbuds called “AirPods” sold as a separate accessory. Read more: Waiting for Apple’s next big announcements Dual camera The iPhone 7 is rumored to be getting a big boost in the photography department thanks to a new camera system. The new iPhone will feature two sensors that snap photographs simultaneously, according to Bloomberg. Each sensor is said to capture color differently, and the iPhone 7’s software will combine the results to produce a single brighter and more detailed image. While the iPhone’s camera is already among the best you can get on a smartphone, Samsung’s newer smartphones are generally better at taking photos in low-light conditions. A dual-sensor system could give Apple the upper hand. One caveat: This upgrade is only expected to appear on Apple’s larger iPhone, likely to be called the iPhone 7 Plus. That’s according to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who has made fairly accurate Apple predictions in the past. iPhone photographers who prefer the smaller model might find solace in the rumor that Optical Image Stabilization (OIS), a technology that helps reduce blur in photos, is coming to the iPhone 7. If true, it will be the first time OIS makes its way to a non-Plus model. Slightly different design Save the absence of the headphone jack, Apple’s next iPhones aren’t expected to look very different than their predecessors. However, Apple is said to have figured out a way to get rid of the antenna bands that stretch across the back of the device. Still, iPhone owners who house their devices in protective cases might not notice the difference. Next year’s flagship iPhones may see a more significant design change. Apple is rumored to be developing three new iPhones, one of which is said to have a curved screen similar to that of Samsung’s newer smartphones, according to Nikkei Asian Review. Apple is also reportedly planning to get rid of the home button as part of this redesign, Bloomberg reports. No 16GB option Apple may finally bump up the entry level iPhone’s storage capacity from 16GB to 32GB, according to The Wall Street Journal. Most Android phones come with 32GB of space by default, but Apple has maintained that 16GB is sufficient for those who use the cloud for most computing tasks. However, critics say that even with cloud storage, 16GB is hardly enough storage for many users, particularly because the iPhone’s operating system tends to take up some of that space right off the bat. “The belief is more and more as we use iCloud services for documents and our photos and videos and music, that perhaps the most price-conscious customers are able to live in an environment where they don’t need gobs of local storage because these services are lightening the load,” Phil Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of global marketing, recently told tech blogger John Gruber. Tap-to-pay for mass transit in Japan Apple is planning to incorporate a tap-to-pay technology called FeliCa into its next iPhone, according to Bloomberg. This tech will allow those in Japan to store public transportation passes on their phones rather than having to carry around physical cards. Near Field Communication, which is the technology that powers Apple Pay and other contactless payments, is popular in North America, but the FeliCa standard is very prevalent in Japan. There are 1.9 million payment terminals in Japan that support it, says Bloomberg. While the report says Apple is planning this feature for its next iPhone, Bloomberg also mentions this functionality may debut in next year’s model depending on how talks with Japan-based payment networks play out. iOS 10 Apple’s newest smartphones always come with the latest software already installed. That pattern is likely to continue. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are likely to come with iOS 10 out of the box, which brings an improved version of iMessage that supports app integration, a new Siri that can interact with third-party services, and a revamped Photos app that uses machine learning to determine the contents of an image, among other new features. Older iPhones and iPads will be able to update to iOS 10 in the fall. Read Next Your browser is out of date.

More Comments LinkedIn Tumblr Pinterest Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon Whether the four years represented a time of prolonged procrastination or space for Frank Ocean to find solace in some reclusivity, what matters now is that the wait is over. His new stuff is finally here – and fans, new and old, are going nuts. Blond, released on August 20 on Apple Music, is an embodiment of what was foreshadowed by his prototypical dreamlike and sometimes psychedelic sounds from his now-classic mixtapes. The artist took to Tumblr with a short but sweet post acknowledging the long wait, leaving all the tension surrounding his treatment of his fans quietly dissipating.    Only a few hours after the release of Ocean’s video album, Endless, an anonymous Apple Music representative confirmed to Rolling Stone that the new material would drop over the weekend, also hinting that the album Boys Don’t Cry would be unleashed unto wanton fans under a new name. After years of waiting, Ocean first released the first single of his sophomore album, Nikes, and announced a few pop-up store locations for his Boys Don’t Cry zine that accompanies the new audio material on his website. Related Frank Ocean’s video album Endless indicates the artist’s second coming is just that much closer ‘Art can’t be rushed’: Frank Ocean’s music producer, Malay, comments on album delay Then, the last surprise of the night was an unexpected announcement from Beats1, an Apple Music Broadcast Radio program.  The show streamed Ocean’s Blond for free from 8 p.m. while Apple was getting ready to post it on iTunes for downloading.  The spelling of the new album, however, is very disputed.  On Apple Music and in the Boys Don’t Cry zine, the album is referred to as ‘Blonde’, but the actual album cover says Blond. In true Frank fashion, we’re left questioning whether its an honest mistake, a purposeful jab at gendered language, or just another unexplainable creative statement by the enigmatic artist. Ocean hadn’t released an album since Channel Orange in 2012, and fans have been trying to decipher his vague clues, much to Twitter’s dislike. But now, with his new music finally here, even the more prickly fans will forget their sordid comments once the sweet reverberations of Ocean’s vocal chords reach their ears.      Find National Post on Facebook Twitter Google+ Reddit Email Typo?

Apple is expected to be launching a couple new tablets soon, and we’re here to explore what that might mean to you. As far as Apple tablets go, our expectations were reduced to lost hopes for a fall release of a couple updates, hoping to see the device announced alongside the iPhone 7 event in September or the Mac event in October. We’re learning that early 2017 should be pretty exciting for iOS users. Let’s explore a specific device, join us for a rumor round-up for the iPad Air 3. Update November 2016: As new rumors trickle out, the best news we have this time is a firm expectation for a March 2017 announcement and launch shortly thereafter. Related Articles   iPad Pro vs iPad Air 2 – a big tablet just got bigger2 weeks ago   Apple iPad Air vs iPad Air 2July 15, 2016   Apple iPad Air 2 vs iPad Mini 4 – quick comparisonJuly 3, 2016   iPad Pro 9.7 vs iPad Air 2: let’s see what’s newMay 2, 2016 What’s new? The obvious first thing on all of our minds is what will be new in the iPad Air 3. With the iPad Air 2 still going strong and the iPad Pro 9.7 handily taking the 9.7-inch iPad offering to the next level, what should Apple be doing to capture our attention. The answer is, based on rumor, almost nothing. I made that sound rough, what we are expecting from the iPad Air 3 is the same processing package as is found on the iPad Pro 9.7. Considering the amount of time the A9X has had to mature, using it, or just the A9, along with the removal of the extra ports and accessories that make the Pro tablet a pro tablet, the iPad Air 3 could be the next ‘budget’ iPad. This leaves room for a newer Pro tablet with a newer A10 chipset and force-touch display. Update November 2016: With the extra time to develop the next tablet, perhaps we’ll be wrong, perhaps the iPad Air 3 will share the same A10 chipset as the iPhone 7 and we can expect an A10X, or similar slight update, for the next Pro tablets. Related: Why the Apple A10 Fusion chip is so good It’s not all boring, Apple is rumored to be trying out new, harder aluminum, which could lead to an even thinner design. Should the iPad Air 3 take advantage of the new True Tone equipped display panel of the iPad Pro 9.7, we would be very excited, and we think you should be too, but we sort of imagine that will be saved for the Air 4. While we can only hope that Apple will include the stereo speaker setup found on both Pro tablets, we can be certain that iOS 10 will be the software behind it all. Let’s round that up quick: Apple A9 or A9X chipset A10 Fusion or A10X Harder aluminum for a slimmer design Better speakers iOS 10 When can we buy the iPad Air 3? I want to premise this with a harsh reality, Apple just launched a new 10-inch tablet. With the iPad Pro 9.7 only a few months old, it is somewhat unlikely that Apple will push the iPad Air 3 this fall. This logic is in agreement with the rumors out there suggesting that we might see the iPad Air 3 in March of 2017. Apple is certainly due for an update to the larger iPad Pro, as to the mini iPad line this year, and they have a rumored 10.5-inch iPad in the works for next year, all of which seem more likely to launch before we see the iPad Air 3. Keep in mind this is all speculative, it could very well be that Apple launch the iPad Air 3 in September with a November shipping date, just in time for the holidays. Update: Following Apple’s predictable Spring / Fall event scheduling, we have every reason to believe we will see the iPad Air 3 announced in March of 2017. Stay tuned for updates, but keep in mind we won’t know a firm shipping date until after the announcement. For those that are concerned with storage space, which I hope is all of you, the rumor mill says 32GB will be the starting place. We can only continue to speculate, but 64GB, 128GB and 256GB models are all logical to us. It will be interesting to see what sizes Apple includes, however, as they have a recent track record of skipping sizes that other iPad models cover. For example, you can get the iPad Air 2 in 16GB and 64GB sizes, but the iPad Pro 9.7 comes in 32GB, 128GB and 256GB. Pricing Now we’re truly getting into speculative territory. Truth is, we have only the history of launch prices to pull from here, Apple is very good at keeping this sort of information a secret until the last moment. While we have seen others guess that Apple will stick to a $599 starting price, as they pretty much have with all full size iPad models for years, we think they’ll offer a reduced price this time. This, however, truly depends on how much tech they borrow from the iPad Pro 9.7. If the True Tone display panel is used for the iPad Air 3, we will concede the above familiar price point, without this panel, though, we think it possible a $549 or even $499 starting price. Wrap up As you might imagine, particularly if the iPad Air 3 is slated for a Spring 2017 launch, rumors are pretty slim as yet. This simply means that we’ll be revisiting this article as often as we must in the coming weeks or months as new info leaks, watch for the updates. What do you say, if the iPad Air 3 is the new ‘budget’ iPad offering, will you consider it, or stick with the Pro line?

That's according to a report from the Nikkei Asian Review, which quotes a source "familiar with Apple's plans." The anonymous tipster told the publication: "There will be a 4.7-inch model, another that will be 5.5-inches, and a premium handset that will be either 5.5-inches or larger equipped with a screen bent on the two sides." This description is pretty vague, and could mean an iPhone with the more noticeable curves of the Galaxy S7 Edge, or the subtler lines of the Galaxy Note 7. Nikkei also quotes an analyst claiming that Samsung will be a supplier for these new displays. The publication notes that the premium iPhone will also use OLED for its screen — something that's been previously rumored (as well as the curved display), with earlier sources suggesting that a 5.8-inch OLED display is being prepared for the device. Nikkei notes that it was previously expecting a "premium" 5.5-inch model to be released this year as well, but says that the device was scrapped by Apple, and that the company will instead be releasing a regular 5.5-inch "iPhone 7 Plus" and a 4.7-inch "iPhone 7." It's worth noting that Nikkei's source doesn't mention the fate of the (4-inch) iPhone SE in 2017. Apple is set to unveil new iPhones early next month. Nikkei’s source backs previous reports from Bloomberg and others that the 5.5-inch model will come with a dual-camera system while the 4.7-inch model will use a single lens. We’re expecting the phones to resemble the iPhone 6 and 6S designs, only with less pronounced antenna lines, the removal of the headphone jack, and a pressure-sensitive home button.

By Agamoni Ghosh August 23, 2016 13:29 BST The macOS SierraApple Apple has released the seventh beta for the macOS Sierra, which is the company's upcoming OS version for MacBooks along with the macOS Sierra Public Beta 6. The latest beta release comes days after Apple released the iOS 10 beta 7 for iPhones, iPads and iPod touch devices. The build carries No 16A304a and both developers and public beta testers can download the update through the Mac App Store. Developers can also download the beta from the Apple Developer Centre. The macOS Sierra is a major update for MacBooks that among other features brings Siri to the Mac for the first time. The OS also has a new Safari improvement for watching videos, a feature that has existed on select iPads for a while. Besides, the new OS features an "Auto Unlock" option through which an Apple Watch user can unlock his Mac from the watch itself. Apple Pay is slated to hit the MacBook post the macOS Sierra update, with facility to authenticate payments through an iPhone or Apple Watch. Messages on macOS Sierra will get a new interface with rich links for previewing web content. The Photos app for MacBooks has been overhauled with new features that take advantage of computer vision to recognise people, places and more. Just like Google Photos, the overhauled app from Apple will curate a user's past photos into collections via a new tab called "Memories." The final and stable version of the Sierra is expected to be released sometime next month at an Apple event, where the company is also slated to release the iPhone 7 and iOS 10 among others.

Written by Karthekayan Iyer | Updated: August 24, 2016 8:04 am This day, 25 years ago – Internet became basis of our communication and information exchange. Internet, the global platform that connects humans and machines, was comissioned 25 years ago today. On 23 August, 1991, the public accessed World Wide Web for the first time. The credit for designing and deploying the WWW protocol go to Sir Tim Berners-Lee. World Wide Web or Internet, as we know it today, was developed by computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee at CERN Labs in Switzerland. If legends are anything to go by, Sir Lee wrote the protocol for WWW on a NeXT machine, a computer developed by late Apple CEO Steve Jobs, after he resigned from Apple, In fact, Tim Berners-Lee was one of the many attendees at Apple’s WWDC, and wanted to show his ideas of internet to Jobs. While Internet and World Wide Web are two different things, they are often referred in conjunction with each other. Internet often refers to the network, whereas the World Wide Web refers to the plethora of information available on this network. Internet has been defined and developed by many computer scientists in the past, but Tim Berners-Lee designed the basic foundation. In 1980, Sir Lee developed the concept of hyperlink, an easy method to link different pages and contents together. Based on hyperlink, Sir Lee built HyperText Transfer Protocol (referred to as HTTP). In 1990, Sir Lee eventually built HTML, URL, a web browser, server and the very first web page to make World Wide Web a reality. The very first webpage based on this architecture went live on August 6, 1991. While the first page was only accessible to CERN members, the first publicly available web page was accessed on August 23, 1991. This day, almost 25 years ago – Internet became basis of our communication and information exchange.

Depends on Which Taxman Asks (AP Images/Leon Neal) Tuesday, 23 Aug 2016 07:25 AM Close  More ways to share... Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Jeff Bezos’s relentless focus on user experience has helped him make Amazon the most valuable e-commerce company in the world. But regulators in Europe and the U.S. say that the value Amazon places on the technology behind that experience varies radically depending on which side of the Atlantic it’s on -- and which appraisal will lower its tax bill. In Europe, the e-commerce giant tells authorities that the intellectual property behind its web shopping platform is immensely valuable, justifying the billions in tax-free revenue it has collected there since moving its technology assets to tax-friendly Luxembourg a decade ago. In the U.S., however, it plays down the value of those same assets to explain why it pays so little in taxes for licensing them. Authorities on both continents are asking questions. European competition regulators are investigating whether the company received illegal state aid from Luxembourg that would require repayment of back taxes. And the U.S. Internal Revenue Service sent Amazon a notice of adjustment in May stating that the company owes $1.5 billion in back taxes. Amazon.com Inc. says it’s following the law. “Amazon pays all the taxes we are required to pay in every country where we operate,” it said in a written statement. The company has sued in U.S. Tax Court to block the IRS’s move. A ruling is expected this fall. Critics, however, are asking why Amazon and other companies are allowed to assign a market value to their own assets for tax purposes. “We insist on this fiction that we can ask firms to report where they had their income and expenses, and that a global firm is going to distinguish these in a way that is true to economic reality,” said Kimberly Clausing, a Reed College economics professor who studies international tax avoidance. Lots of U.S. companies -- including health care firms like Merck & Co. and tech firms like Facebook Inc. and Apple Inc. -- move their intellectual property assets to tax havens overseas. From there, they effectively rent out their core innovations to operating units of the same company. The biggest of these companies shift billions of dollars to the tax havens through royalty payments, thus lowering the parent company’s tax bill. Tax watchdogs complain that the companies are improperly diverting revenue from the tax jurisdictions where it’s generated. Executives whose companies are most aggressive in their tax planning, like Apple CEO Tim Cook, say they are just trying to serve their shareholders and remain competitive while also complying with the law. What’s notable about Amazon, though, is that the separate investigations of its tax treatment provide a basis to compare the company’s dual rationales -- and their contradictions. IP Transfer When Amazon transferred its IP rights to a Luxembourg subsidiary in 2005, for example, it told U.S. tax officials they were worth $217 million. Although Amazon didn’t report a comparable figure in Europe, the following year it reported revenue of more than $100 million from licensing those assets in the region. That figure rose to about $400 million the year after, according to the company’s filings to Luxembourg authorities. In all, the Luxembourg unit -- called Amazon Europe Holding Technologies SCS, or AEHT -- recorded royalty revenue of about 5.2 billion euros ($5.9 billion at the current rate) before adjustments for inflation and exchange rates over the past decade. The figures reported by Amazon are “absurd for anyone with a basic command of mathematics,” said Fabio de Masi, a German member of the European Parliament. Amazon defends its tax payments in Europe, asserting that regulators there are mistaking high revenue for high taxable profits. It says its profits there have been crimped by heavy investments in the IP and strong competition. Project Goldcrest Through 2014, the company’s strategy -- dubbed Project Goldcrest, after Luxembourg’s national bird -- involved an elaborate 28-step process to exploit tax loopholes by forming offshore subsidiaries, moving assets and shifting profits to tax havens, according to court documents filed by the company in its lawsuit over the IRS’s claims. Those documents show that at the center of the plan was the Luxembourg subsidiary, AEHT, which was established as a limited liability partnership, a structure that exempts it from taxation in the tiny European Union state. To move revenue from Amazon’s e-commerce businesses in France, Germany and Britain, those units first made royalty payments to the company’s European operating subsidiary in Luxembourg, called Amazon EU Sarl, according to European Commission regulators. That unit is subject to taxes, but it slashed its taxable income by making deductible royalty payments to the tax-free AEHT unit for the regional sites’ use of Amazon’s web shopping platform and trademarks, the commission has said. Licensing Payments The difference between how Amazon measured the value of its assets in two major markets became clear when AEHT made licensing payments to its parent company in Seattle for rights to the shopping technology. Officials at the IRS say the reduced licensing payments to the Amazon parent company in the U.S. has resulted in the underpayment of hundreds of millions of dollars a year in taxes. In legal papers and testimony from expert witnesses, IRS officials argued that the IP, including the company’s brand, was a lucrative component of Amazon’s rapid growth beginning in 2005, a period in which the company established itself as the world’s dominant online retailer. Daniel Frisch, an economist called by IRS lawyers, calculated the value of the IP at $3.6 billion -- more than 15 times the amount Amazon’s accountant calculated -- and concluded that most of the trademarks, patents and technology would hold their value for decades. Amazon’s Defense Amazon countered with its own experts who said that the IP was perishable given the high failure rate of tech companies. It also argued that the IRS calculation had drastically underestimated the amount of research and development costs that should be attributed to AEHT, which would reduce the value of its IP. Although Amazon lawyers blocked an IRS attempt to compel Bezos to testify, they sought to submit his published comments in a Playboy article in 2000 expressing doubt about the value of brand loyalty, a central element of the IRS expert’s valuation estimate. “Our customers are loyal to us right up until the second that somebody else offers them better service,” Bezos told the magazine. The U.S. Tax Court judge in the case, Albert G. Lauber, ultimately decided not to admit that article as evidence. Back Taxes In preliminary findings, European regulators said the arrangement approved by Luxembourg has allowed Amazon to conduct a significant amount of business in Europe while paying minimal tax. Amazon’s director of public policy, Andrew Cecil, told U.K. lawmakers four years ago that the internet retailer had Europe-wide sales of 9.1 billion euros in 2011 and had a tax outlay of about 8 million euros. That’s less than 0.1 percent. The EU is expected to issue a decision in its case in the next few months. Analysts say the investigations of Amazon and other multinationals have had a deterrent effect. Last year, Amazon stopped booking transactions from Britain, France, Spain and Germany through Luxembourg and instead attributed the revenue to the countries where the sales occurred -- and are subject to tax. Amazon officials declined to say what motivated its change in policy.   © Copyright 2016 Bloomberg News.

This is true for computer operating systems too. Read More ? Wondering how to install software on your MacBook from the command line? Got an old Windows app that you simply must run on your new Apple computer? Your Mac’s operating system operates quite differently to its Windows counterpart. There’s no central registry, quite often no installer files, and uninstallers are a lot less common on the platform than they are on Windows. So here’s what you need to know about adding or removing software on your Mac. Installing from Mac App Store Suitable for: Common apps that can use the platform’s marketplace to install updates, but many software packages are often missing. You should also avoid buying games from the Mac App Store Why You Should Avoid Buying Games From The Mac App Store Why You Should Avoid Buying Games From The Mac App Store The Mac App Store doesn't hold a candle to the same store used by iPhone and iPad users to guzzle apps, games and in-app purchases. Read More , particularly multiplayer ones. App stores are probably the easiest way to install software on any platform, whether it’s your iPhone or Windows 10. The main drawback is that many common apps are missing from the store Why Do Developers Keep Leaving the Mac App Store? Why Do Developers Keep Leaving the Mac App Store? Is the Mac App Store becoming a burden for Mac developers? We decided to talk to a few and find out. Read More , and that apps listed must conform to Apple’s sandboxing rules which restrict what developers can do. That also means this is probably the safest source of third party software. Ads by Google You’ll need to login to the Mac App Store before you can use it, simply launch it, then click Store and Sign in using your Apple ID. To install apps from the Mac App Store: Launch the Mac App Store app and find the app you want by browsing the relevant tabs, or searching for it. Choose an app and click Install, then enter your Apple ID password to verify your identity. Wait for the app to download and install, then launch it by clicking Launch, searching Spotlight, 7 Good Habits Every Mac User Should Get Used To 7 Good Habits Every Mac User Should Get Used To Today we're going to share our favourite good Mac habits, while desperately trying to forget the bad ones. Read More  or finding it in your Applications folder. To remove an app you’ve installed this way, launch Finder and navigate to your Applications folder. Drag the app’s icon to the Trash bin to remove it. Any apps you’ve downloaded in the past (free or paid) can be re-downloaded under the Purchased tab. Drag & Drop Installs Suitable for: Apps you’ve downloaded from the Internet as .DMG, .ZIP or .APP files. If you’re downloading an app from somewhere other than Apple’s marketplace, there’s a good chance you will be downloading a .DMG file. These are disc images, which you must double-click to mount like a DVD or USB drive. They’ll then appear in your Finder sidebar under Devices. You may also download .ZIP archives, which you’ll need to extract first by double-clicking on them. Sometimes websites will simply download the .APP file. To install these apps: First mount your .DMG and open the device in Finder, unzip your .ZIP, or and find your .APP file. Drag your .APP file (the app’s icon) into the Applications folder in Finder. You may need to provide an admin password for apps that require additional privileges. Launch the app via Spotlight (command+spacebar) or by finding it in your Applications folder. You can drag the app icon to the Trash to remove the app. Packaged Installers Suitable for: Windows-like app installers bundled as .PKG files. Sometimes you’ll need to install software using an installer, bundled as a .PKG file. This is just like installing software on Windows, where the installer will usually provide a few options to choose from, and often require an admin password to make changes to your system. To install a .PKG, simply double-click it and follow the instructions. While you can often drag the app icon to the Trash like any other, apps installed via this method sometimes have packaged uninstallers or apps. You may also need to supply an admin password to make changes to certain parts of your system. Command-Line Install Suitable for: Common apps that are available through central repositories, users who value fast installs and the efficiency of a command line experience Mac CLI Simplifies Your Command Line So You Can Work Faster Mac CLI Simplifies Your Command Line So You Can Work Faster The Terminal is a powerful and fast way to work but it can be intimidating for many users. Mac CLI makes it much easier to find and use the commands line using simplified syntax. Read More . You can access your Mac’s command line with a bundled app called Terminal, found in the Applications > Utilities folder or by searching Spotlight. It’s also possible to install software via this method, which is much quicker than finding software, unpacking it, and dragging icons into folders. To make this simple, you’ll need a package manager called Homebrew: Head to the Homebrew website and copying the command listed underneath “Install Homebrew.” Launch Terminal and paste the command followed by Enter. Your Mac will install Homebrew, and prompt you to install any additional packages you may need. Once installed you can use the brew command in Terminal to install software, e.g. brew install firefox Once installed you can use the command line to install a variety of common free apps like Dropbox, VLC, Transmission and many more. Check out our previous article covering Homebrew and what it can do Install Mac Software From Terminal With Homebrew Install Mac Software From Terminal With Homebrew Install (almost) any free Mac app by typing four words and hitting "Enter". Read More . Installing Windows or DOS Software Suitable for: Windows software you simply can’t live without, old games, and any non-native apps you want to run on your Mac. There are two ways to run Windows software on Apple hardware, where no native Mac version exists. The first is using a compatibility layer called Wine How to Run Windows Apps & Games with Linux Wine How to Run Windows Apps & Games with Linux Wine Is there any way to get Windows software working on Linux? One answer is to use Wine, but while it can be very useful, it probably should only be your last resort. Here's why. Read More . This software allows you to install and run Windows software on Mac and Linux as if you were running Windows. Unfortunately, it’s not the most reliable of solutions, but as there’s no emulation taking place it’s a relatively fast way of doing so. The other way of doing this is using virtualization, where you use software to emulate a Windows PC and run Windows on top of OS X. While this will provide the most stable performance (the software is after all running on its intended OS), it’s a resource-hog that requires lots of free memory and processing power. You also may run into problems with drivers and 3D acceleration. We’ve previously covered this in an article about running Windows and DOS games on your Mac 5 Ways to Play Old Windows & DOS Games on Your Mac 5 Ways to Play Old Windows & DOS Games on Your Mac Want to play classic Windows and DOS games on your Mac, but unsure where to begin? Today we'll be looking at all your available options, and how to choose between them. Read More , but the guide applies as much to regular software as it does to Age of Empires II. Everything you need is covered under the Virtualization and Wine sections. If possible, it might be worth finding yourself a native app to do the job instead. You’ll experience faster performance and greater stability. Running Software & GateKeeper GateKeeper is Apple’s answer to the growing problem of Mac malware. It’s a security feature that stops your Mac from running software installed from simply anywhere. By default, your Mac will only allow you to run apps from trusted developers and the Mac App Store, but many apps that don’t fall under this remit are legitimate and pose no risk to your machine. You can change your GateKeeper settings under System Preferences > Security> General. You’ll need to click the lock icon and enter an admin password to make changes, but you’ll be able to disable the feature in order to allow software from anywhere to run. An alternative option is to allow apps to run on a case-by-case basis, which removes the need to disable the feature completely. After you run an app that’s been denied by GateKeeper, head straight to System Preferences > Security > General where your Mac will report it denied an app from running. You can then click the Open Anyway button to create an exception for that particular app, which will allow it to run in future. Removing Software As noted in most of these install methods, the easiest way to remove software usually involves finding the app in your Applications folder and dragging the icon to the Trash bin. You might also find an uninstaller package too. But a more thorough and convenient way of uninstalling files is using a free app called AppCleaner. It allows you to bulk-remove applications, which means you can free up lots of space and clean your Applications folder out in one go. It will also go deeper than a simple drag-and-drop, and try and remove other files associated with apps that you no longer want. It’s so thorough it can even reset shareware trials, but you didn’t hear that from us. Check out our guide to uninstalling just about everything from your Mac How To Uninstall Just About Anything From Your Mac How To Uninstall Just About Anything From Your Mac No registry, no uninstaller – how do you completely remove a program from Mac OS X?

Navigation Menu Gaming Technology Entertainment eSports Guides Reviews Competitions Follow us on Twitter Follow us on Facebook Subscribe To Rss Feed Apple TV review – a South African perspective Home » Apple » Apple TV review – a South African perspective Posted By Zoe Hawkins on Aug 23, 2016 | 23 comments Most devices are made primarily for an American audience, with Europe and then the rest of the world added for consideration down the line. The Xbox experience is far superior in the States to what we get here in South Africa, and we wanted to know if the same was true for the Apple TV. Having heard wonderful things about the TV set top box part of the Apple ecosystem, we got one for review and tested just how much it can do for locals. Set up Many people are put off by the idea of new technology because they are worried about difficult set up. In fact, it has always been part of the appeal of Apple products; from the early days of Macintosh computers through to the age of iMacs, iPods and iPhones, Apple tech is built to be easy and intuitive, and the Apple TV is no exception. Simply plug in the device’s power and an HDMI cable (sold separately), input your Apple ID and connect to the internet. If you don’t already have an Apple ID, you can create one, although chances are that if you’re getting an Apple TV you have at least used an iPhone or iTunes. The box is small and will fit on pretty much any TV stand, cabinet or can even be mounted to the wall next to your TV if you so wish. The Apple TV comes with a basic remote, but if you already have an iPhone or iPad, I’d recommend downloading the remote app. It consolidates the amount of electronics you need to keep track of, and helps when you need to type anything in because you can use an actual keyboard instead of scrolling through letters with the most irritating UI imaginable. Simply open the app on your phone, connect both your phone and your Apple TV to the same network and the app will prompt you to connect to the Apple TV. A code will appear on the TV that you will need to enter into your phone or tablet, and you can officially lose that tiny, standard Apple TV remote. Once you have the basic set up sorted, the rest is fairly straight forward. Head to the app store and there is a selection of recommended apps to download. From Netflix to YouTube to ShowMax, you can get the apps you need to make up for the fact that your TV isn’t so smart, or maybe you don’t like the TV-based apps. Or can you? Yes, the core applications are there. If you’re simply looking for a device to bring streaming TV to your living room, the Apple TV can do that. It has the most popular ones for South Africa, namely ShowMax, Netflix and YouTube. However, most of the apps were noticeably missing, including Hulu, HBONow and Showtime. ESPN could be downloaded but then gives the error that it doesn’t work in this region. I sort of expected that seeing as ESPN is based in the US of A, but there was no Super Sport app that I could find, and the only app I could grab to watch Rugby not only required a subscription, but was also region locked against South Africa. Even Apple Music and its wonderful radio options weren’t available with my South African account and IP. Related:   World of Final Fantasy Review That was my biggest frustration. Instead of telling me that an app wouldn’t work in my region, the Apple TV would let me download it, giving me false hope, only to be met with the “this service is not available in your region” message upon opening the app. This meant that there was a surprisingly limited number of apps that seemed worthwhile to grab for the Apple TV. I ended up paring it down to Netflix, YouTube and (a third party version of) Twitch, all of which ran normally, although I found Twitch to be rather laggy compared to when I watch on other devices. The worst thing, though, was that the Apple TV has been stripped of its browser. I hunted for a while to see if I could download Safari, Chrome or any other browser on the device and failed miserably. Granted, I have other devices for browsing, but I was hoping to put on some radio websites or other browser-based entertainment and was completely foiled. However, there are options to change your location if you so wish. You can create a US-based Apple ID, and even easily manually set your DNS settings to make use of a service like UnoTelly to pretend you are in New York so that you can get all the things. I still had the usual issues I’ve had lately with Netflix, though, so don’t expect to be able to watch the latest Orange is the New Black just because you’ve logged into the Apple TV with an American Apple ID. That said, the rest of the Apple TV experience is far superior this way; there are a ton more apps to choose from, including free music and video options like Pandora or Crackle. Despite the distance from the servers, I managed to run Crackle without any streaming issues. But it’s not all bad I know, I’m making it sound like we are totally restricted here in South Africa. And while yes, there is a lot of geo-fencing to make you crazy, there are also some incredible features. Thanks to the Apple ecosystem, I could easily share the contents on my computer with the Apple TV, sharing all the music on my PC with the device. That includes music that wasn’t purchased through iTunes – it all easily streamed to the Apple TV, including playlists. Even without this feature, any music that I had purchased could be downloaded or stream through the little box, and even compatible apps like Periscope that were installed on my phone showed as available for Apple TV. Related:   Batman The Telltale Series - Episode 3: New World Order Review There are a host of games available for Apple TV, and while they are fun, there is a reason everyone stopped talking about Apple replacing the need for consoles. Although there are different games from what you can grab on iPhone or iPad, they still have that distinctly mobile feel, probably because the only input is directional swipes on the remote (or remote app). I ended up briefly addicted to Crossy Roads and WordWise as I tested them out for review, but while both were addictive, neither was actually satisfying. I’m not one to sit and play mobile games in my living room unless I’m playing on my iPad while someone else plays on the consoles; these games were fun, but not a reason to boot up the Apple TV on their own. Thankfully, the games are all built around the awful remote, so I never felt like the controls were conspiring against me, but I also never felt like I could really get a deep, comfortable or immersive experience. My favourite, though, were the movie options. All the latest movies are available for purchase or rental, and are easily shared across your Apple devices. For review purposes (yes, that’s my excuse), I bought the new Jungle Book. Despite originally saying it would be 30 minutes before my movie would be ready to watch, I only had to wait for a few seconds before it started playing in full HD glory. Plus, movies that are purchased through the Apple TV can also be downloaded and enjoyed on any other device in the Apple ecosystem. The pricing is a bit strange, though, with some older films costing more to rent or buy than recent releases, so be aware before you just click buy. Most surprising to me was the catalogue. While on the South African version of the store, the selection was pretty average – there were a few new and interesting movie titles, but not the depth and breadth that I was used to from buying music off of iTunes. Once I used my American Apple ID and DNS settings, magically so much more appeared. There were a ton of movies and TV series available that simply weren’t offered to the South African audience. I know that many South Africans have Apple IDs for grabbing certain apps for their iPhones, but they will certainly want to set up a way to appear to be in the States if they really want to get value out of the Apple TV. Specs Apple TV 4th Gen Storage: 64 GB Processor: Apple dual-core A8 chip Size And Weight Height: 35 mm Width: 98 mm Depth: 98 mm Weight: 425 g RRP: R3 999 Share this: Twitter Reddit Facebook WhatsApp Google More LinkedIn Pinterest Telegram Pocket Conclusion If you don't have a console or a smart TV, the Apple TV can help turn your TV into a modern entertainment area. But unless you purchase most of your entertainment through Apple, it simply doesn't feel quite as worthwhile for a South African consumer. Apple TV (4th Gen) was reviewed by Zoe Hawkins ﻿ Author: Zoe Hawkins Wielding my lasso of truth, I am the combination of nerd passion and grammar nazi. I delve into all things awesome and geek-tastic. I believe people should stop defining themselves and just enjoy playing games, so let's get on with it! Share This Post On Google Facebook Twitter konfab “Apple tech is built to be easy and intuitive, and the Apple TV is no exception.” “.. an actual keyboard instead of scrolling through letters with the most irritating UI imaginable..” 0_o Zoe Hawkins it makes sense, even if it’s irritating 😛 Dungeon of JJ And needing extra programmes just to copy something off your device instead of just using copy/paste or drag and drop. HvR There was a time with those funky coloured last CRT screen Macs when you plugged in flash drive and it did not detect the partitions it wanted to see it will reformat the drive without prompting the user. Dungeon of JJ Wow Allykhat I got the last gen unit and use it purely as a netflix/hulu/youtube streamer. Works like a charm. Dungeon of JJ I wish there was another way to buy music digitally other than iTunes. konfab Google Play Music. Dungeon of JJ Funny thing is that I googled to find another way to buy music online and that didn’t pop up. Dungeon of JJ Just used it. RIP iTunes. It’s even catered to the music I like, which Apple still somehow doesn’t know how to do XD Guild I cancelled my DSTV as I feel it’s a ripoff now and I bought 2 of the 3rd gen units (R1200) and couldn’t be happier. Current setup is the Apple TV’s linked to US account with Unotelly and I have subscriptions to Hulu and Netflix and also linked in YouTube and Crackle (since it’s free). I also have access to Supersport (via my cousins account) and Amazon Prime (via father in law in Germany) on the iPad which I then airplay to the Apple TV. I also airplay Twitch and sometimes Hearthstone when I feel like playing it on my TV. I tried out ShowMax 7 day free subscription but found nothing of interest to continue it. I tried out Starz as well for Ash vs Evil Dead but also found a lot of the content I already had access to. The issue now is what to watch and where to start as there is so much available. Zoe Hawkins Yeah, if you Unotelly to pretend you’re in the US, it’s an ace device. But if you’re just going to use it with what’s offered to the South African market… it’s pretty lacking. 🙁 DiegoZicoB Do you have access to the US Netflix? I also use UnoTelly but no longer have access to US Netflix since they cracked down on that. So I’ve been looking for ways to get around it. Guild Nope I’ve given up trying to get access to the US Netflix. There a few services that claim they have but with the weekly updates by Netflix it constantly causes companies like Unotelly to find a workaround which then lasts a week before the gap is closed again. RMKennySA If your signed in with your SA apple id. Apple music does work, I use it daily. Unotelly is just giving me issues lately so I’m just with netflix at the moment (Although I do miss Hulu) It uses substantially less power than my ps4 so its okay to just leave it on too. Guild What’s happening with your Unotelly? I found that they have stopped charging me and offer me free months. Only issue is I have to keep remembering when the month is over to log back in and accept to reactivate my account. Dane Here’s to never having an Apple ID! 😀 Dawid Eduard Roestorf There are better streaming devices out there, for cheaper. Apple TV is a rip-off Guild I’m happy with mine but it’s a 3rd gen (R1200) and it works nicely with my iPad and iPhone. What other streaming devices are there and pricing of them? I didn’t really look since I had other Apple products. Dawid Eduard Roestorf I will get my complete list at home, but just off the top of my mind: ROKU, Chromecast, Amazon Fire TV, and of course the consoles. With the apple tv you have, you can only use the apps on the device, or need to stream through your phone. Which is an extreme hassle. I would prefer something where I can download the apps i need. for that you need the newer apple tv, which is exactly the same as your, but you pay R2k for 32gigs storage. Utter ripoff. Guild Never heard of Roku until I recently went to Durban and saw my Uncle had purchased one. It was ok but I really didn’t like the UI. I agree about the ripoff costs of the 4th Gen which is why I bought the 3rd Gen ones. The streaming via iPhone or iPad is really not a hassle, I swipe up push the airdrop button and select the Apple TV to play on and it does the job. HairyEwok A South African perspective of Apple is pear shaped to be honest. Yondaime 4 grand?! really?! this place we live in makes not being a pirate ultra difficult.

According to Fast Company, Apple has now acquired Gliimpse, a personal health data startup, that was founded in 2013 by Anil Sethi and Karthik Hariharan. Sethi, said to be a serial entrepreneur started, has worked as a systems engineer at Apple during late 1980s. Gliimpse’s personal health data platform allows any American to collect, personalise, as well as share a picture of their health data. This acquisition is said to have taken place earlier this month but the company decided to be tight lipped about it. Needless to say. the acquisition is aimed at sprucing up Apple’s efforts in digital health. The company already has services such as HealthKit CareKit, and ResearchKit. “That’s in line with Gliimpse’s mission of uniting disparate streams of health information,” the report adds. There is no official announcement from Apple or Gliimpse. However, Apple did acknowledge the acquisition and told the news site, “The company has now confirmed the purchase, saying: “Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans.” Tags: Apple, Apple acquires Gliimpse, Gliimpse, Health startup, med startup Also read No more Apple Store, it is now simply ‘Apple’ The 2016 Apple wishlist: Here’s everything that I want to see from Apple this year X APPLE Reviews Apple buys Tuplejump, a Hyderabad-based machine learning startup Apple acquires an artificial intelligence startup called Turi for $200 million Underrated apps every budding entrepreneur should use Apple accelerator in Bengaluru: What does the startup community think of the move?

Take testifying before congressional panel on whether apple should open the phone of one of the San Bernardino shooters. Yeah I sub Butler privacy surveillance and security fellow at the Center for Democracy and Technology. Was watching the hearing she joins us with more from DC great to have you. Thanks good to be here. OK so how successful has FBI director James coming been in his testimony from your assessment. My assessment is spending he's not really being that successful or persuasive he's only repeating the same old tired arguments that we've heard time and again. Those arguments are that the government somehow has the authority to compel apple. To create a new software that will undermine the security that it is built into its own devices. And that the government can do this based on it 200 into one year old statute I don't think. Representatives on the dollar buying it today to be honest well that's that he used to strike very conciliatory. It seems. You know talking about the importance of cooperation. Between the government and between companies and protecting privacy but still having security. Not successful in your your mind now. Now because apple has been cooperating with the FBI repeatedly the only reason they've had to go this route is because the FBI and the county messed up. With out going through apple they remotely change that I clap past heard of this device. If they hadn't done that they would have been able to take this iPhone to a location where it could've been connected to Wi-Fi. They could have backed up the iPhone and apple could have then access that data. Because they didn't go that route now they have to resort to this ancient statue. He was asked about that and did admit that out Apple's General Counsel. Arguing that basically by creating tools unlock the phone it's gonna be in the history of security of hundreds of millions of apple devices. Is that going to be the dominant and more successful argument today. It really should be. The fact of the matter is this is not just about one time oneself found. First of all they are ready asking for apple to comply with additional orders that are very similar to this one and very soon you'll be hearing from New York estate attorney Cyrus Vance who has RD sat in the testimony that he submitted that he wants this same ruling to a fight 275. Other cellphones that he has on hand. But also wants apple creates this master key. Other hackers other governments other governments that we may not trust his matches we trust her own. Are going to wanna use the same the same software so ultimately if apple creates it just this one time it's going to create a Frankenstein monster that is only going to get worse. And what happens we have a testimony today where is congressional well. What exactly happens after this testimony is over with the next step. Well after this testimony is over I know that there will be other hearings I think energy and commerce is actually planning on having their own hearing on this issue. In terms of what happens in California we'll have to see we do know that right now. New York judge has actually ruled that the all writs act does not apply here and does not enable the government. See you force apple to create software like this that obviously want. Hi it will be appealed to the second circuit. But it won't apply here because we're in California however I do believe that that case is persuasive and that any judge that hears and the ninth circuit is probably going to have to listen to that argument. Partly to thank you so much. I think you got to have Butler privacy surveillance and security Allah at the Center for Democracy and Technology and not here now this is Reuters.

There is, though, rather a big catch for Amazon: the service will only work on the company’s own Amazon Echo speaker. Apple worked hard from the start to try to reduce the monthly cost of what was then Beats Music, and was said to have specifically targeted a $5/month subscription as that matched the average spend of its best iTunes customers. Apple needed the agreement of music labels because the licensing model is one where labels get the bulk of the monthly fee, streaming services effectively taking a commission from the fee charged to consumers. When music labels refused, Apple tried for $7.99, but wasn’t able to agree this either. When it finally launched, Apple Music charged the same $9.99/month as competing services, a three-month free trial the only concession it was able to win. One of the reasons labels fought so hard to retain the standard $9.99/month pricing was licensing terms dictated that any concession offered to Apple would have to be offered to other services too. This was the basis on which Apple was able to offer its only $5/mo deal – the same half-price student subscription offered by Spotify. Which makes this report all the more curious. It may be that labels view an Echo-specific service as such a niche market that it isn’t worth worrying about. Amazon’s discount service would be different, industry sources say, because it would work like Spotify or Apple Music — unlimited, ad-free music on demand — but it would be constrained to Amazon’s Echo player, and wouldn’t work on phones. That runs counter to conventional wisdom in the music business, which believes that most people value the ability to take their music with them and play it whenever they want. The piece does note that it’s not a done deal – though the sticking point is said to be only over whether Amazon can charge $4 or $5 per month. It will be interesting to see whether the deal is actually done.

Cornerback. 2014, draft pick. (Bradley Roby, first round.) 2015, draft pick. (Doran Grant, fourth round.) 2016, draft pick. (Eli Apple, first round.) No other OSU position had seen a player drafted each of the last three years. The Buckeyes have cranked up a cornerback assembly line. Next up? Gareon Conley. Here's how it has worked since Meyer arrived. The No. 1 corner leads the position group in meetings, leads the way on the field, then goes to the league. The No. 2 corner who started opposite him then slides into the top spot. Smooth. Cornerbacks coach Kerry Coombs was already talking to Conley about the line of succession in January, soon after Apple declared for the draft. "Absolutely, Gareon is ready," Coombs said then. "It's nice to have a guy who has been a starter, who is coming back to lead the room. What was great for these guys, even if you go way back it was Roby and Travis Howard when we first got here (in 2012), it's been the same process." Roby to Grant to Apple and now to Conley, who was Apple's roommate since they arrived at Ohio State. Now Apple is gone, the No. 10 overall pick to the New York Giants in April, and Conley is up. He's a redshirt junior and could be back next season, but it's a safe bet to assume he'll turn pro barring something unexpected this season. But that's the NFL. This is the season. Coombs said Monday that Conley, after what he has shown in preseason camp, is every bit as ready as Roby, Grant and Apple were to be a top cornerback in the Big Ten. Can Gareon Conley be Ohio State's next great cornerback? If things go as planned, the current winner of the No. 2 cornerback spot, either redshirt sophomore Marshon Lattimore or true sophomore Denzel Ward, should be next up on the line a year from now. "They're battling neck and neck right now," Conley said. Right now, it's his turn. "I feel like I'm on the right path," Conley said. "With the team and where I fit with the team in my career, I feel like I'm on the right path.  "We're held to the highest standard here, we have to be the best, and that's what I'm aiming to be."

Apple iOS 10 Release Date Leaked.. by Barbra Streisand? Facebook Twitter Google+ Print E-mail Posted by: Jay Curd on 23 August, 2016 11:30 AM As Apple fans eagerly await the arrival of the iPhone 7 and iOS 10, a release date for the revamped operating system might have been revealed by a most unexpected and unlikely of sources.. Apparently singer and actress Barbra Streisand has claimed in an interview that she was so frustrated by the fact that Apple voice assistant Siri couldn’t pronounce her name correctly – stumbling on the S sound in the middle, making it sound like a Z – that she personally contacted the company CEO Tim Cook to confirm the issue will be dealt with once and for all with “the next update on Sept. 30”. The Hello, Dolly! and Funny Girl actress, who was expertly parodied by South Park, offers us a very specific timeframe for the new software which in no way corroborates with the rumours we’ve heard about the upcoming iPhone 7 launch, which is actually suggested to be taking place in early September with iOS 10 pre-installed complete with improved Siri support and it should be released publically for other devices starting a few days later. We think Babs might be singing us a line here, in fact there is probably no siri-ous truth whatsoever behind her claim, but it’s still amused us greatly that her name should crop up amongst all the big iPhone 7 news and rumours as we quickly approach the proper launch date. We certainly don’t see her becoming the next Evan Blass!

Home Business Software Chips Mobile Internet Security Review Desktop Software Graphics cards Laptops Mobile apps Mobiles Peripherals Storage Tablets Workstations TechEye Home Business Software Chips Mobile Internet Security Review Desktop Software Graphics cards Laptops Mobile apps Mobiles Peripherals Storage Tablets Workstations Menu Only Apple and Samsung make money out of smartphones Posted on August 23, 2016 by Nick Farrell - Business, Mobile, Mobiles Only Apple and Samsung are making money from smartphones and Apple is losing ground fast. According to beancounters working for Canaccord Genuity, Apple accounted for 75 percent of the smartphone industry’s profits in the second quarter, but that’s down from more than 90 percent a year ago due to Samsung’s Galaxy device success. Samsung’s Galaxy S7 launch and the Note 7 follow-up likely indicate that profits will continue to do well,. Cannaccord Genuity analyst T. Michael Walkley said that Apple’s industry profit was also suffering because punters were delaying purchases ahead of the iPhone 7 launch. Although it is a moot point if that particular product will do well.  Either way Samsung has captured more than 30 percent of industry profits in the second quarter. Walkley said that Apple’s industry profit share is at its lowest point since the second quarter of 2014 before the iPhone 6 launched. However it does look like all the other makers trying to get in the high end of the market are not scratching the surface. Walkley said: ” Given the ramp of Chinese OEM smartphone volumes and particularly strong 2015 smartphone market share gains for Huawei, we note our industry profit analysis excludes a large portion of this group of OEMs gaining an increasing share of the smartphone market profits due to the lack of available and comparable profit metrics. While this likely overstates Apple’s profits, we note some leading smartphone OEMs in China are growing global market share through aggressive pricing strategies limiting near-term profit levels. Inside the Greater China region, share has shifted to Chinese OEMs as well.

Apple chief executive Tim Cook has called 2015 the company’s ‘most successful year ever’. Photograph: Stephen Lam/Getty Images Apple has more than $205bn of cash in the bank, the company revealed on Tuesday as its chief executive Tim Cook said the firm had made more than $234bn in 2015, making it its “most successful year ever”. The California company now has more money in the bank than the Czech Republic, Peru and New Zealand make in gross domestic product (GDP) a year, according to World Bank statistics. Apple’s cash balances increased by $2.8bn in the last three months alone. Apple sold 48m iPhones worth $33.2bn in its latest quarter – an increase of 36% on the same period last year and more than the total sales achieved by both Microsoft and Facebook over the same period. Its quarterly profit came in at $11.1bn, 31% more than in the fourth quarter of 2014. Sales were up 22% in the three months to 28 September to $51.5bn. “Today we’re reporting a very strong finish to a record-breaking year, ” Cook said. “We are heading into the holidays with our strongest product lineup yet.” Apple, which is already the world’s most valuable company, worth $657bn, said predicted sales would increase further to between $75.5 and $77.5bn in its current quarter as only the first weekend of new iPhone 6S sales were captured in the previous three months. “We think we can grow iPhone (sales) during the December quarter,” chief financial officer Luca Maestri said. The average iPhone now sells for $670, an increase of $67 on the previous quarter. Sales in China doubled compared to the same period last year, to $12.5bn, and some analysts predict that China could overtake the US to become Apple’s biggest market. While the iPhone continues to soar, iPad sales dropped for the seventh consecutive quarter and were down 20% compared to the 2014 fourth quarter. The company did not state how many Apple Watches it has sold. Apple’s shares, which have fallen by about 15% from a peak of $133 in July, increased by 0.6% to $114.5o in after-hours trading in New York on Tuesday. –The Guardian Related Posts NetOne likely to lose $11 mln Firstel debt – liquidator HARARE,– State-owned mobile operator, Netone, is likely to lose $11 million to its former service provider, Firstel Cellular after its liquidator said the defunct telco can only pay one percent ...

Samsung launched its latest flagship phablet Galaxy Note 7 earlier this month and reviewers have already started comparing the iPhone flagship offerings to the smartphone. From the initial results, it seems like Apple might be still holding the upper hand over the South Korean company, at least in terms of real work app performance. If we go by the latest speed test comparison video between Galaxy Note 7 and iPhone 6s posted by YouTube channel PhoneBuff, the former is well behind the latter even though the iPhone 6s was launched last year.In the speed test, both smartphones were made to open 14 applications, one after the other and while iPhone 6s was able to perform this task in in 1 minute and 21 seconds, Galaxy Note 7 took 2 minutes and four seconds to complete the same. Opening all 14 apps the second time, the iPhone took 1 minute and 51 seconds, while the Galaxy Note 7 took 2 minutes and 49 seconds. The Samsung Galaxy Note 7 sports some impressive specifications as the phone packs a quad-core Snapdragon 820 SoC, coupled with 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM. On paper the phone is expected to beat Apple's iPhone 6s, which comes with dual-core A9 processor and the 2GB RAM. However tests seem to show otherwise. Although, this test might not be conclusive proof that iPhone 6s is a faster phone compared to Galaxy Note 7, as there is only one scenario presented in the test, it is fair to assume that Apple is able to produce a significantly better results in terms of performance despite having seemingly inferior hardware because of better collaboration between the operating system and the hardware on its phones.Apple will be coming up with its latest smartphones next month, expected to have a superior hardware than present on iPhone 6s, and it will be interesting to see how Samsung tackles the situation from here onwards.

Gliimpse translates medical records into data that doctors can take action on. The startup enables consumers to create a medical history that can be shared with their care network- doctors, friends and family. Founded by ex-Apple employee and entrepreneur Anith Sethi along with IIT Chennai graduate Karthik Hariharan in 2013, Gliimpse takes inspiration from Obamacare that federally mandates hospitals and physicians to provide the medical data back to the patients. Sethi writes on his LinkedIn page, "As a consumer of healthcare, I leave behind a bread-crumb-trail of medical info wherever I've been seen. But, I'm unable to easily access or share my own data. Obamacare is one of several forcing functions federally mandating physicians and hospitals give us our data: meds, labs, allergies. However, there's no single Electronic Health Record that all physicians use, sigh. Worse, there isn't even a common file format across a 1000+ systems." As a means to solve the "hardest medical data problem", Gliimpse collects data from medical portals and combine them with self-entered data as well data from devices, all without any sort of human intervention. Gliimpse's ideology fit perfectly with Tim Cook's vision of Apple entering the consumer segment of the $9 trillion healthcare industry. Apple has already integrated its HealthKit, CareKit and ResearchKit in its operating systems and Gliimpse can only improve the service further. But, how exactly is Gliimpse going to feature in Apple's plans? Too early to tell. As a matter of fact, Apple is working with a lot of other startups in the medical field, so it can enjoy a larger piece of the pie that is global healthcare.

Today it revealed it has acquired Gliimpse, a personal health data startup that hints at Apple's plans for the new device, suggesting it will focus on health. The acquisition was first reported by Fast Company. Apple completed the purchase earlier this year but hasn't publicly acknowledged it until now. This week, it confirmed that Gliimpse is part of Apple, without revealing why it made the purchase or the technology that Gliimpse is working on within Apple. "Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans," the company told Fast Company. Gliimpse is a Silicon Valley-based personal health data platform aimed at an American audience. Founded in 2013, it allows you to collate and share a personal health record that’s stored online. You can personalise your data, save recent medical results and share your profile with medical workers. According to co-founder Anil Sethi, Gliimpse was created out of a need for an easier way to store and manage personal health data. After helping his sister through treatment for breast cancer, Sethi realised that healthcare creates a trail of medical data wherever you go. That data, despite being highly personal, isn't usually directly available to you, however. Sethil noted that Obamacare has had an impact on this by forcing physicians and hospitals to make data available. However, his LinkedIn profile points out that a myriad of different file formats are used across over a thousand IT systems. Sethil wanted an "Electronic Health Record" that's open both to the user and medical staff. He set out to create it, building Gliimpse. In many ways, Gliimpse is similar to Apple's existing work in the digital health sector. Through apps like Apple Health, HealthKit, CareKit and ResearchKit, Apple is already allowing any iPhone user to build and share their own medical profile. Doctors can connect directly with patients through Apple's apps, enabling them to keep an eye on the data without calling the patient in for an appointment. Fast Company noted that Gliimpse stands out in Apple's portfolio because of its focus on chronic conditions, including cancer and diabetes. It comes shortly after Apple hired a top pediatric endocrinologist who developed an app for teenagers with Type 1 diabetes, using its HealthKit platform. The company appears to be planning to build applications that can better cater to the especially challenging requirements of patients with complex conditions, diversifying its collection of healthcare services and allowing it to help more people. Apple is widely expected to use the Apple Watch 2 to take its next steps into the healthcare market. The upcoming version of the wearable will launch later this year, according to a recent report. It is expected to include a wider range of sensors than the current model, allowing users to collect more health data that can be stored in their Apple Health profile and securely shared with their doctor. The current Apple Watch is more aimed at tracking fitness levels, such as daily step counts, floor climbs and calorie burns than medical-grade health data. Over the past couple of years, Apple has indicated it values the opportunity of being able to give people control of their medical data, however. Providing people with a compact tracking device to wear on their wrist would go some way to achieving that aim. Apple has not disclosed how much its acquisition of Gliimpse has been valued at. There is currently nothing about the deal on either the Gliimpse website or on the LinkedIn pages of co-founders Anil Sethi and Karthik Hariharan.

You couldn't do much worse than the Apple I nowadays, but if 1976’s debut from Apple is what you’re after, then you have a rare opportunity to make that dream come true. Providing you have at least $505,000, that is. That’s the current price that an Apple I is going for in a charity auction taking place on Charitybuzz – quite a step up from the $666.66 it sold for in 1976, even when you take inflation into account. The site estimates its worth at $1,000,000, which is even more of an increase, but it does have precedent. Another Apple I sold for $900,000 two years ago . The ridiculous price the computer goes for relates to its scarcity: the Apple I was hand-assembled by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, and only 200 of them were ever made. Of those, 175 were sold, and we know the whereabouts of fewer than 100 in 2016. Read More Rare 1976 Apple computer worth $200,000 accidentally thrown away at recycling centre Once you accept that any old Apple I is worth $1,000,000, you begin to realise that this particular model could actually end up selling for a lot more. Not only is this a charity auction, which tends to inflate bids somewhat, but this is even rarer than normal. The listing explains that no known circuit boards of this type have ever been sold to the public, meaning the prize is most likely a preproduction model. Don’t worry, though, for your money, you’re not just getting an antiquated computer with no technical support that won’t run the latest version of OS X – you're also getting all the manuals, schematics, a sales receipt from the previous owner and two games: Star Trek and Blackjack .

Overall sales of mobile phones contracted by 0.5 percent with only five vendors from the top 10 showing growth. Among them were four Chinese manufacturers (Huawei, Oppo, Xiaomi and BBK Communication Equipment) and South Korea's Samsung. "Demand for premium smartphones slowed in the second quarter of 2016 as consumers wait for new hardware launches in the second half of the year," said Anshul Gupta, research director at Gartner. In addition, the decline in sales of "feature phones" (down 14 per cent) bolstered the decline in overall sales of mobile phones in the second quarter of 2016 (see Table 1). All mature markets except Japan saw slowing demand for smartphones leading to a decline in sales of 4.9 percent. In contrast, all emerging regions except Latin America saw growth, which led to smartphone sales growing by 9.9 percent. Table 1 Worldwide Smartphone Sales to End Users by Vendor in 2Q16 (Thousands of Units) Company 2Q16 Units 2Q16 Market Share (%) 2Q15 Units 2Q15 Market Share (%)Samsung 76,743.5 22.3 72,072.5 21.8Apple 44,395.0 12.9 48,085.5 14.6Huawei 30,670.7 8.9 26,454.4 8.0Oppo 18,489.6 5.4 8,073.8 2.4Xiaomi 15,530.7 4.5 15,464.5 4.7Others 158,530.3 46.0 160,162.1 48.5Total 344,359.7 100.0 330,312.9 100.0 Source: Gartner (August 2016) In the second quarter of 2016, Samsung had nearly 10 percent more market share than Apple. Samsung saw sales of its Galaxy A and Galaxy J series smartphones compete strongly with Chinese manufacturers. Its new smartphone portfolio also helped Samsung win back share it recently lost in emerging markets. Apple continued its downward trend with a decline of 7.7 percent in the second quarter of 2016. Apple sales declined in North America (its biggest market) as well as in Western Europe. However, it witnessed its worst sales decline in Greater China and mature Asia/Pacific regions, where sales declined 26 percent. Apple had its best performance in Eurasia, Sub-Saharan Africa and Eastern Europe regions in the second quarter of 2016, where iPhone sales grew more than 95 percent year on year. Among the top five smartphone vendors, Oppo exhibited the highest growth in the second quarter of 2016 at 129 percent. This is due to strong sales of its R9 handset in China and overseas. "Features such as an anti-shake camera optimized for selfies, and rapid charge technology, helped Oppo carve a niche market for itself and boost sales in a highly competitive and commoditized smartphone market," said Mr. Gupta. In terms of the smartphone operating system (OS) market, Android regained share over iOSto achieve an 86 percent share (see Table 2) in the second quarter of 2016. Android's performance continued to come from demand for mid- to lower-end smartphones from emerging markets, but also from premium smartphones, which recorded a 6.5 percent increase in the second quarter of 2016. A number of key Android players, such as Samsung with the Galaxy S7, introduced their new high-end devices, but Chinese brands like Huawei and Oppo are also pushing their premium smartphone ranges with more affordable devices. "Google is evolving the Android platform fast, which allows Android players to remain at the cutting edge of smartphone technology," said Roberta Cozza, research director at Gartner. "Facing a highly commoditized smartphone market, Google's focus is to further expand and diversify the Android platform with additional functionalities, like virtual reality, enabling more-intelligent experiences and reach into wearables, connected home devices, in-car entertainment and TV."

More than just technology news Home Tech Reviews Science Games Culture Video Stay Connected Facebook Twitter RSS Updated Hot Tags Pokemon Go Pokemon Sun And Moon Apple Pokemon Sun And Moon news Pokemon Go Update Xiaomi Challenge Apple And Samsung: Chinese Tech Company Enters US Market This October Benjie Batanes First Posted: Aug 23, 2016 03:20 AM EDT Lei Jun, chairman and CEO of China's Xiaomi Inc. presents the company's new product, the Mi Note on January 15, 2015 in Beijing, China. (VCG/Getty) Xiaomi is reportedly set to challenge Apple and Google smartphones in the United States. The Chinese tech company is set to enter one of the most lucrative markets in the world this October. There are speculations that the product Xiaomi intends to sell to Americans is its smartphones according, to Phone Radar. It is currently the Chinese company's biggest selling product in the Asian region. Its latest smartphone product, the Redmi 3S is reportedly doing well. Xiaomi - Lowest Price Smartphone Xiaomi in theory can get a good slice of the American market away from Apple and Samsung. Its main advantage is affordability for products with a decent spec. The upcoming iPhone 7 and the new Galaxy Note 7 offers feature and specs that clearly outclasses Xiaomi's Redmi 3S. However, budget conscious US consumers will find the Chinese smartphone as the cheaper alternative to Apple and Samsung's pricey smartphones. Xiaomi Tapping American Mobile Carriers If Xioami intends to launch its smartphone line to the US, the company will need to tap the services of US mobile carriers such as AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile and Sprint. Such sales strategy will put Xiaomi in direct competition with the two smartphone heavyweights, Apple and Google. Xiaomi's current sales model however, is selling its smartphones directly to customers online or otherwise. This current model has been largely successful in the Asian market, according to CNET. This is not the case in the US where most customers prefer to buy their smartphones from the mobile carriers. It remains to be seen if Xiaomi will stick to its current selling model or create a partnership with the US mobile carriers. It is also quite possible that the Chinese tech company will adopt both sales strategy. Xiaomi US Market Status Xiaomi is not a stranger to the US market. It has exported a number of its products to America for several years now. Its product lines in the US include power banks, headsets and many others.

He previously covered technology for Bloomberg News. Follow @tculpan Facebook Twitter Email Print Share Aug 22, 2016 8:00 AM EDT ZTE CORP-H -0.32 At Closing, Nov 23rd 12.00 HKD APPLE INC -0.93 As of 1:09 PM EST 110.87 USD In the next five years, a majority of U.S. consumers will have bought a Chinese-brand smartphone. Such a prospect may raise the hackles of purported American patriots and presidential candidates, but it's reality. Outside of Apple and Samsung, Chinese brands rule the global smartphone market. LG gets a hand in from time to time, Blackberry isn't dead yet, and Nokia keeps bouncing from one identity crisis to another -- but the trend is irreversible. Yet ask any consumer in the U.S. to name a smartphone that isn't Apple, or at the very least one that isn't Apple or Korean. There's only one way for Chinese brands to go from here. That's why their pending dominance is a fact, not just speculation or fear mongering. Global Showdown Samsung and Apple's share of the worldwide smartphone market has fallen from 42 percent to 33 percent amid the rise of Huawei and other Chinese brands Source: Counterpoint Research Just as television makers Zenith, Motorola and RCA were eventually replaced by Japanese names like Sony, Sharp and Panasonic, so too will Chinese brands overtake the U.S. market. The latest entrant looks set to be Xiaomi. The richly valued upstart appears ready to dip its toes in one of the world's most important electronics markets. While China is larger by volume, the U.S. is lucrative because average device prices are much higher. In an interview with Bloomberg Television on Friday, Xiaomi's vice president and international front man Hugo Barra said a U.S. move is inevitable: We will lead with social media, with the channels that allow us to get in touch with the young generation that are enthusiastic about new technology. We are definitely going there. Xiaomi's entry into the U.S. has been in doubt on concern that the Chinese company, which has been widely criticized as a wholesale copycat of Apple and others, would immediately face intellectual property lawsuits. However, Xiaomi's purchase this summer of around 1,500 patents from Microsoft seems to have quelled those worries and given the Beijing startup the courage to move directly onto Apple's home turf. The Chinese company won't be short of compatriots. ZTE, the world's number six smartphone brand, is fourth in the U.S., while TCL-Alcatel holds fifth spot. And then there's Huawei, now the world's number three, which will start selling its latest device under the Honor brand later this week. With solid technology, financial muscle and global aspirations, expect to see more of Huawei in the U.S. in years to come. U.S. Turf Samsung and Apple have maintained their dominance of the U.S. market, largely in the absence of aggressive moves by Chinese brands. Expect that to change Source: Counterpoint Research What's significant about a Xiaomi move is that along with the brand, the company is likely to bring the same business model that emaciated profits in the Chinese smartphone market: namely, direct online sales, social media-focused marketing and razor-thin margins. That model has proven so compelling that Lenovo (which now owns Motorola's smartphone business) and Huawei have both incorporated it into their own strategies, while Oppo and Vivo are key beneficiaries. With ever fewer differences between Android models, this price fight portends declining share for Apple and Samsung. Samsung and Apple combined U.S. market share 59% This means that Chinese expansion will result in the U.S. starting to look a lot like every other market in the world. Whereas Apple and Samsung hold a combined 59 percent of the U.S. market, according to Counterpoint Research, they have just a 33 percent share worldwide. Global slots three through seven are all Chinese.  So while the nostalgic may decry the rise of China, they still need to face the fact that the U.S. smartphone industry has passed its zenith.

A report reveals that Apple acquired the personal health data startup Gliimpse earlier this year. (Photo by Eric Thayer/Getty Images) A report revealed on Monday, August 22, that earlier this year Apple acquired personal health digital records startup Gliimpse as part of its strategy to increase its focus on health application tools. Gliimpse's Technology According to Apple Insider, Gliimpse's acquisition by Apple potentially opens the possibility of implementing enhancements to ResearchKit, HealthKit and CareKit. Gliimpse's technology is focusing on patients with chronic medical conditions such as diabetes and cancer. According to Fast Company, personal health data records startup Gliimpse has built its technology to help patients collect, personalize and share their personal health data. The startup was launched in 2013 by Karthik Hariharan and Anil Sethi, who was at one-time an Apple systems engineer in the late 1980s. After taking his company Sequioa Software public in the year 2000, Sethi has spent over a decade working with health startups. He stated that the mission of Gliimpse is to eliminate issues linked to personal health data being scattered across multiple providers of healthcare. This situation is a challenge in the way of easy access or share of personal health information between emergency personnel, caretakers or patients. The Gliimpse platform is intended to make medical records easily comprehensible and condense them into standardized coded elements for health providers and patients to easily have access to information and trends. Apple acquired Gliimpse earlier this year, but up to date it kept quiet about it. The purchase has been confirmed now by Apple. Apple's Intents With Gliimpse Platform The acquisition of personal health data records startup Gliimpse will help Apple's efforts in digital health. Apple has delved into this field in recent years with a range of services such as ResearchKit, CareKit and HealthKit. These services allow researchers, clinicians and patients to access important wellness and health data via mobile devices. That is matching Gliimpse's mission of uniting various streams of health data. There are rumors claiming that Apple is working on a new health-focused device able to collect data such as blood sugar changes, pulse, heart rate, and more. Reports suggest that company's health development team is been working on the project for over two years.

The new Galaxy Note 7, which was launched by the South Korean tech giant earlier this month, is powered by a 14-nanometer Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 quad-core 64-bit processor and 4GB of RAM. Although the handset appears to be more powerful than many of its existing rivals, including the iPhone 6s featuring dual-core A9 processor and 2GB of RAM, the performance test suggests that Apple’s current flagship smartphone is still capable of outperforming Samsung’s latest offering. As part of the test, both the smartphones are made to simultaneously launch the same apps. But, despite the Galaxy Note 7’s advanced hardware, it was apparently defeated by the iPhone 6s, which is a year older than new Samsung handset. The iPhone 6s was able to launch 14 apps, including rendering a video, in one minute and 21 seconds, much faster than the Galaxy Note 7, which took two minutes and four seconds to complete the same tasks. A Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphone is displayed during a launch event for the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 at the Hammerstein Ballroom in New York City, Aug. 2, 2016. Photo: Drew Angerer/Getty Images In addition, the iPhone 6s successfully cycled through two laps of the speed test in one minute and 51 seconds while the Galaxy Note 7 did it in two minutes and 49 seconds. However, there are a few factors that need to be considered before drawing a conclusion purely based on the speed test in question. For instance, the Galaxy Note 7's display supports Quad HD (2560 x 1440 pixels) resolution, while Apple's iPhone 6s features a display with a resolution of 1334 x 750 pixels. Related Stories Optical Image Stabilization Confirmed For 4.7-Inch iPhone 7? Samsung Galaxy Note 7 Injustice Edition Emerges In Leaked Images The operating system is another significant factor in the performance test — the Galaxy Note 7 is running on Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow and the iPhone 6s is running on iOS 9.3.4. Although the test compares the two handsets in an “unusual usage scenario,” it surely indicates that Apple’s efforts to deeply integrate hardware and software in its devices have been paying off, MacRumors reported.

The Apple Watch 2 (or Apple Watch Series 2 to give it its official title) is the second version of the most successful smartwatch around. The Watch was Apple’s first draft at a wearable, and plenty bought into the promise of a phone on your wrist. At TrustedReviews we liked the look of it, but struggled to understand its purpose: It had health and fitness elements, but they were limited, and it didn't offer water-resistance. In addition, the watchOS software was tricky to use, glitchy, and just didn’t do much. Interesting third-party apps were lacking too. BLACK FRIDAY DEAL: Save £30 on Sony Smartwatch 3 now £70 Related: Black Friday Deals Related: Amazon Black Friday Deals There are clear parallels to be drawn between the Apple Watch and the very first iPhone that was released almost a decade ago, which evolved into a superb product. While the iPhone 7 didn’t meet our high expectations of it, the Apple Watch 2 has. All our concerns about the original have been addressed: watchOS 3 is now intuitive and useful; there are plenty of compatible apps; and the Apple Watch 2 is now properly water-resistant. Owning an Apple Watch finally makes sense – especially if you’re the outdoorsy, fitness type. Related: Best Smartwatch Apple Watch 2 – Design The Apple Watch Series 2 looks almost identical to the original, and I don’t mind that at all. This remains my favourite smartwatch when it comes to looks, particularly since it isn't as chunky as rival watches. It helps that I prefer square watches; those who prefer round ones might not be as kind. The Watch 2 is a fraction thicker than the previous Watch, but not enough that you’d notice without seeing the two next to each other. The square screen with rounded glass edges make it simple to swipe up, down, left and right from the edge to provide additional shortcuts, and the rotating Digital Crown still works well as a method of zooming in and out, and general navigation. The button just beneath the Digital Crown has been re-appropriated from a useless shortcut to contacts and on/off switch to a much more engaging way to scroll through the new apps dock (more details to follow). You can opt for either the stainless steel or, slightly cheaper, aluminium chassis, and one of two sizes: 38mm and 42mm. The Series 2 is available in a range of colours: Gold, Rose Gold, Space Grey and Silver. This time there’s no expensive gold-plated model. Instead, Apple has created a beautiful white ceramic smartwatch. The ceramic cast is treated at length at high temperature before it's polished smooth. Not only does it look super-attractive, it’s four times tougher than the stainless steel model. Standing out from the crowd does come at a price, though. The ceramic Apple Watch Edition costs more than three times as much as the standard versions – the 38mm one setting you back a cool £1,249. Suffice to say, it isn't necessary to spend such an amount for an Apple Watch that’s "tough". I’ve dropped my aluminium Apple Watch on several occasions and regularly whack it against door frames; it doesn’t have a single scratch on the screen or body. The headline feature for the Apple Watch 2 is water-resistance. Not only will it survive a brief dunk in the bath, it's now fit for the sea. Apple claims it can withstand up to 50m of water – although we wouldn't advise that you go scuba-diving with it just yet. It’s meant to survive the rigours of arms swinging through water, as opposed to being plunged into the depths. An Apple representative explained to TrustedReviews that the Apple Watch 2 is fit for swimming in a pool for as long as you want, but can also deal with seawater. It was tested on hundreds of swimmers before release, and it provides accurate exercise readings as well as surviving the wet stuff without any bother. The screen locks when under water and so won't be usable, but it will continue to track activity. Once out of the water, the Apple Watch Series 2 performs a little party piece to rid the water from its speaker grilles: it plays sound at various volumes and frequencies to expel liquid like a clam. There's a plethora of straps available for the Series 2 – with an even bigger selection on offer than before – and they're the best way of making an Apple Watch "yours". As well as the relationship with luxury brand Hermès, Apple has also joined forces with Nike to launch the Apple Watch Nike+. This comes with a special strap, whose compression-moulded perforations make it more breathable – ideal for athletes – along with some exclusive Nike watch faces and apps pre-installed. For those who intend to swim regularly with the Apple Watch 2 I'd recommend a Sports strap, rather than the metal or nylon straps. The Sports strap doesn’t retain any water, so you won't be left with a damp wrist all day after a brief plunge.

Amazon wants to sell a cheaper music subscription service that will only work on its Echo player Re/code 8/22/2016 Peter Kafka Spotify, Apple Music and everyone else cost $10 a month. Amazon wants to charge half of that. Popular Searches Eli Lilly and Co LLY ▼ 67.82 -8.17 -10.76% Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 110.89 -0.91 -0.81% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▼ 779.16 -6.17 -0.79% Urban Outfitters Inc URBN ▼ 35.39 -3.62 -9.28% Amazon wants to launch a music subscription service that would work the same way services from Apple, Spotify and many others work: $10 a month, for all the music you can stream, anywhere you want to stream it. But Amazon is also working on a second service that would differ in two significant ways from industry rivals: It would cost half the price, and it would only work on Amazon’s Echo hardware. Industry sources say Amazon would like to launch both services in September, but has yet to finalize deals with major music labels and publishers. One sticking point, sources say, is whether Amazon will sell the cheaper service for $4 or $5 a month. An Amazon rep declined to comment. The $10-a-month service would replicate features that used to be hard to find, but are now common: Unlimited, ad-free music you can play on any device you want, and also download for offline playback. The lower-priced service would represent a novel approach. Other services have tried, without success, to offer subscriptions in the $5 range. But those have usually been variants of web radio services, which don’t let users play any song they want, whenever they want. That’s also the approach Pandora is taking with a new $5 service it has in the works, which it wants to launch alongside a standard $10-a-month service. Amazon’s discount service would be different, industry sources say, because it would work like Spotify or Apple Music — unlimited, ad-free music on demand — but it would be constrained to Amazon’s Echo player, and wouldn’t work on phones. That runs counter to conventional wisdom in the music business, which believes that most people value the ability to take their music with them, and play it whenever they want. The overwhelming majority of Spotify subscribers sign up on phones. Andhen Apple Music launched last year it focused all of its attention on iPhone users, and eventually on Android phone owners as well. Amazon launched the Echo — an Internet-connected speaker powered by Alexa, the company’s AI software — last year, and reportedly sold a million units. It hopes to sell 3 million this year and 10 million in 2017, The Information reports. Amazon already offers an Amazon Music service as a free offering for Amazon Prime subscribers, but that service only has a limited catalog of music. If Amazon launches the music services, it will be the second time it has offered digital media subscriptions as à-la-carte offerings, instead of tying them to its Amazon Prime delivery service. Earlier this year Amazon started selling its video subscription service, which it offers for free to Amazon Prime subs, as a standalone service for $9 a month.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Aug 22, 2016 at 8:23PM Image source: Apple.  According to Nikkei, a generally reliable publication, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) isn't planning to launch just two iPhone models next year, but three. Nikkei, citing a "source familiar with Apple's plans," claims that the first two models will come in familiar form factors: a model with a 4.7-inch display and one with a 5.5-inch display -- sizes that Apple has been producing since the late 2014 launch of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. The third model, however, will reportedly feature an OLED display (a display technology that's superior in many ways to current LCD technology used in current generation iPhones) that's at least 5.5-inches large and will be "bent on the two sides." In other words, Apple will be taking a page from Samsung's(NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) playbook. In fact, according to industry analyst David Hsieh, who is quoted in the Nikkei report, Samsung will actually be Apple's "sole OLED supplier next year." A three-phone strategy would be quite interesting One of the constraints that Apple has had to work under is that it commands the lion's share of the profit in the smartphone industry and wants to make sure to keep it. This has afforded the company the freedom to invest heavily in research and development, but it has tied the company's hands somewhat when it comes to the iPhone's bill of materials cost. This immense profitability and the desire to stay immensely profitable has forced Apple to be more judicious about incorporating new, whiz-bang technologies that add cost and/or manufacturing complexity. Some of these technologies could fundamentally improve Apple's competitive positioning and its users' experience and are worth adding. Others might be viewed as gimmicky by customers and ultimately wind up just being a cost burden. Another factor that has kept Apple from adopting some bleeding-edge technologies has simply been the problem of availability. Apple sells hundreds of millions of phones each year. In some cases, it simply isn't worth taking the risk on technology for which manufacturing yields aren't great or for which industrywide capacity is fairly limited. By introducing a third, ultra-premium iPhone in 2017 alongside two more "mainstream" iPhones, Apple could pretty much get around both of these problems. An iPhone with a curved OLED display (as well as whatever other features Apple would include to justify a premium price for the product) would undoubtedly be more expensive to make than an iPhone with a traditional liquid crystal display. But as long as Apple could  charge customers more for the model with an OLED display, then the increased cost structure wouldn't be too much of a problem. Additionally, if the curved OLED model is a limited, premium-priced device, the fact that Apple has only one source for these displays wouldn't be too big of a risk. Once additional suppliers come online with flexible OLED display capacity (and manufacturing recipes that can produce product at acceptable yields), then Apple could more broadly incorporate OLED displays into its iPhone product lineup -- and beyond.  Ashraf Eassa has no position in any stocks mentioned.

LIKE   TWEET   SHARE   PIN   SHARE   POST MAIL MORE Posted August 23, 2016 at 4:25am by iClarified · 10184 views · Translate Apple is reportedly planning to introduce three new iPhone models next year with one of them featuring a curved OLED display A source 'familiar with Apple's plans' told the Nikkei Asian Review that "there will be a 4.7-inch model, another that will be 5.5-inches and a premium handset that will be either 5.5-inches or larger equipped with a screen bent on the two sides." David Hsieh, a senior director at IHS DisplaySearch, says that only the premium handset will feature an OLED display and the other two models will stick with low-temperature poly-silicon panels. Nikkei says that Samsung is the only company who can currently supply flexible OLED screens. It will likely be the sole supplier for the OLED display used by Apple in its next generation device. Apple is widely rumored to be moving to an all-glass design for the 2017 iPhone. It will reportedly have a front glass cover and chassis, joined by a metal bezel and an edge-to-edge display that has no bezels on the top and bottom. Additionally, the front camera, Touch ID, speaker, and other sensors will apparently be embedded into the display. Notably, Foxconn is said to be developing glass casing technology in order to maintain its position as a key iPhone assembler and capture orders for the device.

Rumors made up by people who are NOT at Apple, and have absolutely NO connection to Apple's cloistered R&D projects for future products. If you think that Apple's security against leaks about the iPhone 7 (which will be finally introduced just 2 weeks from now by Apple, and is currently in production) is amazingly tight... And it has been! Since we know nothing about it other than the fan-made mockups of what they think just the backside of the iPhone 7 will look like (all of the mock-ups so far have had differences from each other)... Imagine how tight Apple's security is on a product that is more than a year away, and that even most Apple employees (except for the small R&D group at Apple) have ZERO knowledge about it. “There are two ways to be fooled. One is to believe what isn't true; the other is to refuse to believe what is true.” ― Kierkegaard Reply · Like · Mark as Spam clown - August 23, 2016 at 1:45pm There will be 20-100 new cars next year woopy do Reply · Like · Mark as Spam Gromit - August 23, 2016 at 5:27am Iclarified always end article titles with a question mark?

Apple was recently in talks to take a stake in Lyft, the No. 2 ride-hailing app in the US, as part of a “strategic partnership” that could pose a fresh domestic threat to Uber, sources told The Post. The size of Apple’s potential investment in Lyft couldn’t be learned, and it’s not clear whether the talks are still ongoing, according to sources briefed on the situation. Discussions about the possible partnership with Apple were focused on forming a possible competitive and operational alliance, sources said. The talks, the sources added, weren’t part of Lyft’s exploration of strategic alternatives this summer, a process that was led by investment bank Qatalyst Partners. “M&A was not discussed at all,” a source close to the talks told The Post, adding, “There’s no interest from Apple or Lyft in an acquisition” of Lyft. Apple’s talks with Lyft are the latest sign that the iPhone maker is escalating what could be a global battle with Uber as both companies expand into self-driving-car technology. Qatalyst, led by hard-charging tech banker Frank Quattrone, “reached out” to Apple about a possible Lyft acquisition, one source noted, as it likewise brokered discussions with prospective acquirers including Google, Amazon and GM. That process, which Lyft’s board initiated after it received an expression of interest from GM, didn’t result in any serious merger discussions, sources said. A mobile device displaying the Didi Chuxing app near an Apple store in Beijing, China.Photo: AP Meanwhile, sources said the operational tie-up being discussed by Apple and Lyft was similar to the one Apple took in July with its $1 billion stake in Chinese ride-sharing giant Didi Chuxing. The deal with Didi, which has been valued at $26 billion, was a key factor in Uber’s decision last month to give up its aspirations to compete as a stand-alone company in China and merge its operations there with Didi’s, according to some industry insiders. Likewise, the prospect of Apple becoming a deep-pocketed backer of Lyft, which was valued at more than $5 billion in its most recent round of funding, could change the competitive equation for Uber in the US, sources said. San Francisco-based Lyft has lately been battling speculation that it is looking to find a buyer, as the end of Uber’s fight with Didi in China has freed up cash for a possible showdown with Lyft in the US. Lyft execs have countered that the company has $1.4 billion in cash, although it has disclosed it’s spending $600 million as it dangles incentives for drivers and passengers alike in an aggressive battle for market share against Uber. “Lyft is not for sale, we are on a fully funded path to profitability,” a spokeswoman said Sunday. On Monday, officials at Apple and Lyft declined to comment.

Red Apple is one of the few locally owned supermarkets left in Manhattan, the others having been driven away by high rents. It’s owned by John Catsimatidis, a Greek-American tycoon who also owns a second supermarket brand, Gristedes. The other day Red Apple, and then Gristedes, stopped taking WIC checks, and Catsimatidis called me to explain why. And before you start thinking about placing blame, let me tell you this tale is a pretty unusual financial story because it strangely has neither heroes nor villains — just a lot of confused people trying to implement a federal program worth billions. WIC stands for “women, infants and children” and it’s a federal nutrition program administered by the states that is meant to supplement all the other social services available. I’m not going to get into whether we have too many of these social programs. Take that up with your bartender. The WIC program works like this in New York: The state Department of Health issues checks to women with kids — but the checks are for specific items and not made out for any monetary amount. For example, the check could be for “8 4-ounce containers WIC baby food veg. &/or fruits” and “one 1.8 ounce Gerber cereal for baby.” Another says “up to 36-ounce WIC cereal and 1 pound dry beans/peas/lentils.” It’s done this way because New York wants to keep secret from the shopper and the store what it will cover for the product. The product on the check is then brought up to the cashier, who rings up an amount and puts that figure into the box. The amount on the first check was written in as $19.23. The second order came to $21.86. And both checks bounced because the amount of the sale, which Catsimatidis says Red Apple discounted from its regular prices, was larger than the mystery amount for which the check was good. Red Apple was assessed a $10 bounce fee for each of those checks. In fact, the company showed me hundreds of WIC checks that had bounced in July alone. Checks that were used to pay $8 or $5 orders all came back with $10 bounce fees from the bank. Catsimatidis is rich, so maybe we shouldn’t care. But he’s also a businessman who isn’t going to continue to absorb costs like this without acting. That’s why Red Apple and Gristedes no longer take WIC checks. Some of you might be saying that New York is stupid for handling the checks like this. But there’s an explanation that even Catsimatidis seems to be sympathetic to. Let’s say the first check — the $19.23 one for baby food and fruits and veggies — had a value on it. Let’s say it was good for $20 or even $25. It’s very unlikely under those circumstances that any purchase would come in under the stated amount. In other words, the grocer would always bump the purchase up to the check’s amount. The state wouldn’t get to save the difference between the $19.33 actually spent and the $20 or $25 stated value. In other words, the program would cost more. And there’s always the fraud aspect, since no group of people is completely honest. And it wouldn’t be surprising if those with money problems worked out a deal with some grocers to purchase goods for less than the stated amount on the check and get some of the rest — after the grocer’s cut — in cash. The State Department of Health says there are 182 grocery stores in Manhattan that still take WIC checks. And it’s looking for more. What could be done? Rents in Manhattan should be lower, so grocery stores can charge less. Then the state wouldn’t have to hand out blank checks that bounce. And people receiving the checks should be completely honest. But, as you know, none of that is probably going to happen. Attention readers who work on Wall Street: I’d like to hear from anyone who attended one of Hillary Clinton’s speeches. Photo: Reuters Hillary was paid at least $22 million for all of her speeches. At that price, I figure, the speeches had to be either very good or — or something else was going on. Hillary, of course, won’t release any of the speeches. So I’d like to hear from anyone who was in attendance at any of her Wall Street speeches. Even better, did anyone tape what she said? Hillary spoke to Morgan Stanley, Fidelity Investments, Apollo Global Management, Sanford Bernstein, Kohlberg Kravis, Goldman Sachs (three times) and Deutsche Bank (twice), among others. At $200,000-plus a pop, I’d like to know she really did say something brilliant. Drop me a line if you were at any of the Wall Street talks. I’ll keep your name confidential. Welcome aboard, JPMorgan Chase. The company’s chief economist, Jim Glassman, gave a talk the other day on “Faulty Economic Indicators.” “Head of economics for JP Morgan’s commercial bankers, Jim deals day in and day out with economic indicators that are sometimes unsound, occasionally flashing false positives, and that rarely all point in the same direction,” read a blurb for Glassman’s chat. This blurb minimizes the problem and the damage it causes. But I’m glad to see at least one economist coming to terms with the fact that government data are junk and lead to bad forecasts and bad decisions. Maybe I’m making progress on this issue.

Photo: Bloomberg New York: The smartphone business is cut-throat, and no one can stay on top for long. Even tech industry die-hards would have had trouble predicting that two Chinese upstarts, Oppo and Vivo, would come out of nowhere to collectively sell one in 10 new smartphones worldwide, as they did this spring. My Gadfly colleague Tim Culpan wrote a compelling column about how Chinese smartphone brands have their sights set on the US and will inevitably steal sales in a country where Apple and Samsung sell a majority of smartphones—a much larger market share than they have in other parts of the world. I’m not sure Tim is right. It’s hard for relatively unknown brands to catch on in the US, at least not without expensive marketing campaigns or buying a brand already well known, as Lenovo did by purchasing IBM’s ThinkPad laptop business a decade ago. If Tim is correct in predicting a shake-up in the US smartphone sales ranks, it still won’t budge the profit picture, which has been as reliable as a metronome despite the ups and downs in the tumultuous industry. When it comes to what matters, Apple and Samsung rule, and they’re unlikely to be dislodged soon. Mike Walkley at Canaccord has been keeping close tabs on the communications technology industry for more than 15 years. And according to his data, since early 2012—practically an eternity in the smartphone business—Apple and Samsung together have generated 100% or more of all operating profits among makers of premium-priced smartphones, which grab enough buzz to lift an entire brand. Yup, that means every other competing company barely breaks even on what should be a high-margin product or is bleeding money. There are a few important caveats in the Canaccord profit data. It doesn’t include some important private companies, including China’s Huawei and Xiaomi, which are selling a bigger chunk of the world’s smartphones both in their home country and in fast-growing smartphone markets like India. Still, those companies aren’t likely making much of a profit and certainly not enough to alter the picture of Apple and Samsung’s profit dominance of higher-priced phones. The bigger question mark is how the changing complexion of the smartphone market will dent the Apple and Samsung profit duopoly. Most of the volume and nearly all of the growth in smartphone sales is happening in places like India, Indonesia and the Middle East, where lower-cost smartphones rule. India in particular seems up for grabs, and Apple is trying desperately to make India a foundation for future iPhone sales as the country nears passing the US as the world’s second-biggest buyer of smartphones behind China. But it’s unclear whether premium-priced phones will ever catch on among India’s consumers. The average smartphone sales price there is expected to be $102 by 2018, according to research firm IDC, while an iPhone sells for an average price of nearly $600. What’s happened in the high volume end of the smartphone market hasn’t eroded profits at the luxury end—at least not yet. But it’s easy to imagine that Apple and Samsung will need to concentrate less on their flagship iPhones and Galaxy phones, and more on the lower-priced tier to the point where their profit advantage erodes. Already the average iPhone sale price slipped to a two-year low in the June quarter after Apple introduced a lower-priced iPhone for the masses. Even as the smartphone industry shifted from hypergrowth to barely budging, Apple and Samsung have continued to gorge all available profits at the fat end of the market. The question is whether the dominance its rivals can’t shake might be undone by the slow-growth, more profit-conscious smartphone market that we’re entering now.
