Apple also expanded its lawsuit against Qualcomm to the likes of China and the UK and last we heard, Qualcomm was planning a countersuit of their own. It looks like that countersuit is finally happening as Qualcomm has announced that they will be countersuing Apple where they claim that Apple was in breach of a contract with Qualcomm, as well as a bunch of other issues that they have. This includes allegations that Apple had interfered with Qualcomm’s agreements with other licensees, encouraged regulatory attacks on Qualcomm’s business, chose not to utilize the full performance of Qualcomm’s chips, and threatened the company in a bid to shut down any public comparisons. According to Don Rosenberg, executive vice president and general counsel of Qualcomm, “Now, after a decade of historic growth, Apple refuses to acknowledge the well established and continuing value of those technologies. It has launched a global attack on Qualcomm and is attempting to use its enormous market power to coerce unfair and unreasonable license terms from Qualcomm. We intend to vigorously defend our business model, and pursue our right to protect and receive fair value for our technological contributions to the industry.” Apple has yet to respond to this countersuit but we can only imagine that they probably don’t agree with it.

Now, Google has apparently made a big move in the sector, offering display manufacturer LG a hefty investment. According to ET News (Google Translate), Google has offered to invest one trillion won ($876-million) in LG‘s Display division in order to ramp up production of flexible OLED screens. The publication says that the size of the investment could still increase. It’s also expected that Google would receive priority on screens if the deal is confirmed. Google is expected to use the displays in its latest round of Pixel smartphones. But it’s not the only company looking to secure a ton of OLED screens… Google seems really serious about securing a production line for OLED screens… The move comes as rumours persist that Apple will release an OLED iPhone. It’s expected that Apple’s decision will result in huge demand for the technology. In fact, a Bloomberg report claims that the technology is already in short supply. The report says that Apple is tipped to only release one OLED-equipped iPhone specifically because the tech isn’t available in huge quantities. It’s widely expected that Apple will also release two LCD-equipped iPhones. According to Nikkei, Apple has reached a deal with Samsung to provide 70 million displays for the new iPhone. “Apple has ordered 70 million units of OLED panels from Samsung this year, while Samsung is preparing to churn out as many as 95 million for Apple in 2017, in case demand exceeds expectations,” an IHS analyst told Nikkei.

Image Credit: Reuters / Mike Blake Qualcomm fired back at Apple in court on Monday, saying the iPhone maker’s January lawsuit should be rejected. Qualcomm also made its own claims seeking damages, accusing Apple of harming its business and breaching deals between the two companies. Apple’s lawsuit accused Qualcomm, one of the leading developers of cellular communications technologies, of abusing its dominant position by forcing phone makers to pay excessive royalties, even when they used modem chips from Qualcomm rivals. But Qualcomm responded that its royalties were consistent with laws around the world and had been adopted by companies for decades. It denied blocking Apple’s ability to use competitors’ products, and said Apple had interfered with its business relationships with companies that manufacture the iPhone and other smartphones. “We have negotiated hundreds of bilateral license agreements over the last two plus decades,” Qualcomm general counsel Don Rosenberg tells Fortune in an interview. “And those have clearly established a clear market value for the tens of thousand, now of patents that we hold in the whole area of cell technology.” The Apple lawsuit, and other antitrust legal challenges against Qualomm filed worldwide, threaten the most lucrative part of the company’s business. In addition to the Apple case, regulators in South Korea, home of top phone maker Samsung Electronics, have issued a nearly $1 billion fine against Qualcomm in a similar case. The large smartphone makers appear to have seen an opening to hit the Qualcomm model after China cracked down on the chipmaker’s allegedly monopolistic practices two years ago, imposing a $975 million fine and forcing new negotiations with device makers. Apple’s lawsuit goes to the heart of Qualcomm’s licensing model, which charges phone makers a percentage of the value of every phone, not just a cut of the price of specific modem chips used in phones. Last year, Qualcomm’s royalty licensing division reported $6.5 billion of pretax profit on $7.6 billion of revenue. Meanwhile, the company’s own chip business itself only made $1.8 billion in pretax profit on $15.4 billion of sales. The threat has spooked investors in Qualcomm. The company’s share price has lost 12% since the day before Apple filed suit. Counterclaims against Apple In its lengthy response to Apple’s lawsuit on Monday, Qualcomm made a series of claims of its own against Apple for which is seeking unspecified damages. Apple interfered with Qualcomm’s agreements negotiated with Asian contract manufacturers, Qualcomm charged. Also, after Apple opted to use a modem made by Intel in about half of the new iPhone 7 line, the company sought to forbid Qualcomm from publicly discussing the superior capabilities in Qualcomm’s similar modem. “Our chips had capabilities that Apple chose not to use in the iPhone 7, in my belief, because they wanted to basically employ a lowest common denominator approach,” Rosenberg says. “Intel’s modem chip couldn’t do, didn’t have the capabilities that our our chips had.” Qualcomm also said Apple violated a cooperation agreement between the two companies. Apple claimed in its lawsuit that Qualcomm had long paid it quarterly “rebates” on royalties through the agreement, but stopped making the payments last year, prompting Apple’s litigation. Qualcomm denies that the payments were rebates on the royalties. Instead, Qualcomm says it paid Apple in return for cooperating with engineering and development of chips and other technologies used in the iPhone. The agreements also prohibited the two companies from suing each other over patents or otherwise attacking each other directly or via government regulators, Qualcomm says.

Qualcomm is now accusing Apple of failing 'to engage in good faith negotiations for a license to Qualcomm’s 3G and 4G standard essential patents on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms'. Qualcomm also claims that Apple: ● Breached agreements and mischaracterized agreements and negotiations with Qualcomm; ● Interfered with Qualcomm’s long-standing agreements with Qualcomm licensees that manufacture iPhones and iPads for Apple; ● Encouraged regulatory attacks on Qualcomm’s business in various jurisdictions around the world by misrepresenting facts and making false statements; ● Chose not to utilize the full performance of Qualcomm’s modem chips in its iPhone 7, misrepresented the performance disparity between iPhones using Qualcomm modems and those using competitor-supplied modems; and ● Threatened Qualcomm in an attempt to prevent it from making any public comparisons about the superior performance of the Qualcomm-powered iPhones. The company wants damages from Apple for reneging on its promises in several agreements and seeks to enjoin Apple from further interference with Qualcomm’s agreements with the companies that manufacture iPhones and iPads for Apple. --- “Qualcomm is the world leader in inventing and developing fundamental, ground-breaking mobile technologies that enable the worldwide mobile ecosystem. Today, Qualcomm's patented technologies remain the primary value driver for mobile devices,” said Don Rosenberg, executive vice president and general counsel of Qualcomm. “The value of our inventions has been proven through hundreds of license agreements, negotiated and renegotiated over almost three decades, with virtually every significant handset maker in history, including the companies in Asia that have manufactured Apple iPhones and iPads. Over the last ten years, Apple has played a significant role in bringing the benefits of mobile technology to consumers with its popular products and services. But Apple could not have built the incredible iPhone franchise that has made it the most profitable company in the world, capturing over 90 percent of smartphone profits, without relying upon Qualcomm's fundamental cellular technologies. Now, after a decade of historic growth, Apple refuses to acknowledge the well established and continuing value of those technologies. It has launched a global attack on Qualcomm and is attempting to use its enormous market power to coerce unfair and unreasonable license terms from Qualcomm. We intend to vigorously defend our business model, and pursue our right to protect and receive fair value for our technological contributions to the industry.” --- This looks like it will be a long drawn out court battle.

Qualcomm specifically handles a lot of the modem chips that connect devices to cellular or WiFi networks, and are crucial to any mobile hardware. Since Apple needed a lot of chips, Qualcomm supplied them, and everything seemed good -- until January when Apple filed a $1 billion lawsuit claiming Qualcomm charged royalties on tech it had nothing to do with, and then followed up with two more antitrust lawsuits in China. Tonight, Qualcomm has responded with a lawsuit of its own (you can grab the 139 page PDF here), claiming that Apple is in the wrong, and has breached its contract with the company.

Qualcomm, which earlier called Apple's lawsuit "baseless," officially denied the majority of Apple's allegations and accused the Cupertino-based company of failing to engage in good faith negotiations for a license to its 3G and 4G standard essential patents on fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory terms. The chipmaker also accused Apple of breaching its licensing agreements, making false statements, and encouraging regulatory attacks on its business in multiple countries. Qualcomm added that Apple has deliberately "chose not to utilize the full performance" of its LTE modem in its iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Apple uses Intel's XMM7360 and Qualcomm's Snapdragon X12 modems for GSM and CDMA models of the iPhone 7 respectively. Independent testing last year found Qualcomm's LTE chip to significantly outperform Intel's LTE chip in the iPhone 7, but it could theoretically be even faster. Apple, however, said there is "no discernible difference" in performance between the Qualcomm and Intel modems in any of the models. Qualcomm said Apple's statement misrepresented the performance disparity between iPhones using its modems and those using Intel-supplied modems. Apple then allegedly threatened Qualcomm about making any public comparisons about the apparently superior performance of the Qualcomm-powered iPhones. Qualcomm, the exclusive supplier of 3G and LTE modems for iPhones until 2016, said Apple has "launched a global attack" against its company, using its "enormous market power" to coerce unfair and unreasonable licensing terms. But the chipmaker insists that it will "vigorously defend" its business model. “Over the last ten years, Apple has played a significant role in bringing the benefits of mobile technology to consumers with its popular products and services," said Don Rosenberg, executive vice president and general counsel of Qualcomm. "But Apple could not have built the incredible iPhone franchise that has made it the most profitable company in the world, capturing over 90 percent of smartphone profits, without relying upon Qualcomm's fundamental cellular technologies. Now, after a decade of historic growth, Apple refuses to acknowledge the well established and continuing value of those technologies. It has launched a global attack on Qualcomm and is attempting to use its enormous market power to coerce unfair and unreasonable license terms from Qualcomm. We intend to vigorously defend our business model, and pursue our right to protect and receive fair value for our technological contributions to the industry.”Qualcomm said Apple "could not have built the incredible iPhone franchise" without relying upon Qualcomm's "fundamental cellular technologies." In its countersuit, Qualcomm went as far as saying Apple has "contributed virtually nothing to the development of core cellular technology." Apple is the world's most profitable seller of cellular devices. But as a late-comer to the cellular industry, Apple contributed virtually nothing to the development of core cellular technology. Instead, Apple's products rely heavily on the cellular inventions of Qualcomm and others. Apple's iPhones and other products enjoy enormous commercial success, but without lightning-fast cellular connectivity—enabled in large part by Qualcomm's inventions—Apple's iPhones would lose much of their consumer appeal.Qualcomm is seeking, among other things, both compensatory and punitive damages from Apple in amounts to be proven in a jury trial for "reneging on its promises in several agreements." It is also seeking to be released from any obligation to make further payments to Apple, per the court filing. Apple for its part accused Qualcomm of using its position as the supplier of a key iPhone component to drive up patent licensing fees. In January, the Federal Trade Commission alleged that Qualcomm required Apple to exclusively use its modems from 2011 to 2016 in exchange for lower patent royalties.

Dylan McGrath, Contributing Editor 4/11/2017 00:01 AM EDT  0 comments   post a comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet A recent report out of Japan says three of tech's biggest and most prominent companies are interested in bidding on Toshiba's memory chip business. Can this be true? Here's one to put in the healthy skepticism file: a recent report from a Japanese newspaper claims that Apple, Google and Amazon have all thrown their hats into the bidding for Toshiba's chip business. Hmmmm. A few disclaimers about this up front. First, the report, which originated in the Yomiuri Shimbun a week and a half ago, doesn't include the attribution of any sources. Second, none of the companies mentioned have confirmed its accuracy. But neither qualifier is in and of itself debunks the story. First of all, the fact that Apple, Google and Amazon have all stayed mum on the report is par for the course. Secondly, with the exception of SK Hynix's bid for a stake in Toshiba in February, all of the companies mentioned as bidders in the Toshiba chip sweepstakes so far have come to light through anonymous sources, simply because nobody with any real knowledge of the process is supposed to be talking at all. For most of the past decade, companies have been scrambling to get out of the memory chip business. Some have literally died trying. Is it really conceivable that three of the largest and most successful companies in high tech — none of which are semiconductor suppliers — are willing to plunk down something in the neighborhood of $18 billion to buy their way in? Perhaps not. More recently, news reports have indicated that Toshiba has whittled the list of potential buyers down to a handful, with no further mention of Apple, Google or Amazon (more on this below). Whether there was ever any truth to the report of Apple, Google and Amazon sniffing around Toshiba, the fact that this possibility even generated any smoke at all says two things: the memory business is better positioned right now than it has been in a long time and NAND flash is a very desirable commodity right now in this era of Big Data deluge. "If [the report is] true, it shows Amazon and Google consider flash to be a key component for their datacenters and are willing to put money down to secure supply of this strategic commodity, especially in a market where NAND flash supply is tight," said Greg Wong, founder and principal analyst at Forward Insights, a market research firm focused on the memory chip business.

By Asha McLean | April 11, 2017 -- 02:52 GMT (19:52 PDT) | Topic: Banking Westpac Banking Group has launched Samsung Pay, opening up the phone-based wallet to debit and credit card cardholders across both Mastercard and Visa. According to Westpac chief executive of Consumer Bank George Frazis, the integration with the electronics giant sees Westpac become the first Australian-owned bank to offer Samsung Pay. Latest Australian news ​Ombudsman labels Centrelink 'robo-debt' system unfair and unreasonable NBN fixed-line speeds to be monitored Qantas kicks off commercial in-flight Wi-Fi with speeds of around 7Mbps ​Commonwealth cybersecurity compliance to be probed by parliamentary committee ​ACCC takes Apple to court over alleged misleading consumer guarantee "Customer behaviour is changing all the time and the growth of mobile banking in the past three years has been exponential," he added. "Our strategy is to be where our customers are, and we are delighted to offer some of the world's most popular mobile payment platforms to our customers." Samsung Pay is available wherever near-field communication (NFC) payments are accepted, and is compatible on Samsung devices such as the Gear S3 smartwatch and the soon-to-be-released Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus smartphones. The integration with Samsung now sees the 200-year-old bank offer both Samsung Pay and Android Pay -- which it launched last year -- in addition to Westpac's own tap and pay function, which was unveiled to customers in 2014. However, Apple Pay is not yet offered by the bank. Westpac is part of the group of four banks that has been seeking regulatory approval since mid-last year to collectively negotiate with third-party mobile providers such as Apple on conditions relating to competition, best practice standards, and efficiency. Last month, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) issued a determination denying authorisation for Westpac, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA), the National Australia Bank (NAB), and Bendigo and Adelaide Bank to collectively bargain with Apple and boycott Apple Pay. Throughout the process, the banks have claimed that they want access to the NFC controller in iPhones and reduced their argument in February to solely focus on such, as Apple currently does not allow any other entity direct access to its technology. The group has been arguing that access would enable them to offer their own integrated digital wallets to iPhone customers in competition with Apple's digital wallet without using Apple Pay -- which is what Apple wants to avoid. "We take a strategic partnering approach to payments innovation while continuing to develop our own technology," Frazis said on the matter. "Although we don't agree, we respect the ACCC's decision on our application which was about giving customers choice and all participants access to the NFC chip. We have seen no loss of business as a result of not offering Apple Pay." In delivering its first quarter market update in February, fellow big four member Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) said that for the three months ended December 31, 2016, initiatives including Apple Pay and Android Pay drove ongoing net customer acquisition gains in its Australian Retail Transaction Banking segment. ANZ was the first bank in both Australia and New Zealand to launch Apple Pay, in April last year. Speaking with journalists in Sydney last week, Westpac CIO David Curran was asked if his bank was considering speaking with Apple in regards to Apple Pay, separate from the rest of the banking cartel. "We were naturally disappointed with that decision ... phones are platforms, people learn to use them, so actually saying NFC is not open doesn't make sense to me as a CIO of a bank," he said in response. "That needs to be open so we can innovate on it and the ACCC has made its decision and we respect that in terms of how that will continue and we are very open with and continue to work with Apple and will stay that way." The CIO said that NFC is a platform that everyone needs to develop on, given its presence among retailers and other financial services companies, for example. "It's not like Westpac and trying to protect something, it's actually, we're saying, it should be open," Curran added. "It's a platform we all use and we've used for a very long time. Why are we closing it? Naturally we're disappointed in it." Curran said "time will tell" if not adopting Apple Pay under the iPhone maker's current terms will be a competitive disadvantage for his bank when compared to ANZ. Last month, the bank launched Westpac Keyboard, which enables customers to pay friends and share their BSB and account details without leaving messaging apps such as Facebook, Twitter, and WeChat on Apple devices. For the 2016 financial year, Westpac reported AU$7.4 billion in after-tax profit, representing a 7 percent drop year on year. During the 12 months to September 30, 2016, Westpac spent AU$1.9 billion on technology-related expenses as part of its ongoing digital transformation.

Qualcomm countersuit claims Apple ‘refuses to acknowledge’ the value of its technology Posted 3 hours ago by Jon Russell (@jonrussell) 0 SHARES Next Story Uber isn’t welcome in Italy anymore | Crunch Report Apple filed a billion-dollar royalty lawsuit against Qualcomm in January and today the chipmaker hit back with a legal case of its own against the iPhone maker which, it claims, has refused to acknowledge the value of its technology. In the original suit, Apple claimed that Qualcomm — which makes money from licensing its patents to technology makers — was charging it for patents “they have nothing to do with.” That, Apple said, included TouchID, display panels and camera components. Apple also accused Qualcomm of inflating prices through its licensing model. “Apple could not have built the incredible iPhone franchise that has made it the most profitable company in the world, capturing over 90 percent of smartphone profits, without relying upon Qualcomm’s fundamental cellular technologies. Now, after a decade of historic growth, Apple refuses to acknowledge the well established and continuing value of those technologies,” Qualcomm executive VP and general counsel Don Rosenberg said in a statement. In more specific details, Qualcomm claimed Apple had “breached agreements and mischaracterized agreements and negotiations with Qualcomm,” adding that the phone maker “interfered” with its manufacturing partners that build the iPhone and iPad and use Qualcomm licenses. Things get more dramatic with the iPhone 7. There are different versions of the device in the U.S. running modem chips from both Intel and Qualcomm. Apple had previously suggested that the Intel-powered devices were superior and were therefore being pared back to ensure that customers had the same quality regardless of the internals. Qualcomm has, unsurprisingly, not taken too keenly to that. The firm said that Apple “chose not to utilize the full performance” and then “misrepresented the performance disparity” between it and Intel’s tech. Further, Qualcomm claimed Apple threatened it from going public to explain that its tech was actually behind the superior iPhone. “[Apple] has launched a global attack on Qualcomm and is attempting to use its enormous market power to coerce unfair and unreasonable license terms from Qualcomm.

While it had been previously reported that Qualcomm was considering legal action, the company made it official today in a 134-page filing… Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case In the filing, Qualcomm firmly denied the allegations made by Apple. The chip maker stated that Apple is trying to use its power to force Qualcomm into lowering royalties for its own sake (via CNET): “Apple’s goal is clear — to leverage its immense power to force Qualcomm into accepting less than fair value for the patented technologies that have led innovation in cellular technology and helped Apple generate more than $760 billion in iPhone sales,” Qualcomm said in its filing. Additionally, Qualcomm accused Apple of breach of contract and interfering with agreements and relationships Qualcomm has with other companies. The company also accuses Apple of withholding payments that are part of a previously agreed upon relationship for high-speed technology. Furthermore, Apple is being accused of deliberately making false statements to the government relating to Qualcomm’s business. While Apple argued in its lawsuit that Qualcomm had caused damages to its business, Qualcomm states in its lawsuit that “to the extent that Apple has suffered damages, if at all, all damages were caused by Apple’s own actions.” Perhaps most notably, Qualcomm alleges in its lawsuit that Apple knowingly under-clocked the Qualcomm LTE chip in the iPhone 7 to get of rid of discrepancy between models with the Intel chip. Apple also allegedly threatened Qualcomm to prevent it from making public comparisons that unearthed the “superior performance of Qualcomm-powered iPhones.” Apple originally sued Qualcomm earlier this year for $1 billion over patent royalties. Apple’s lawsuit followed an FTC complaint that alleged Qualcomm engaged in monopolistic practices to prevent Apple from sourcing key components from competitors. For its part, Qualcomm responded and explained that Apple “intentionally mischaracterized our agreements and negotiations.” Originally, it had been reported that Qualcomm was mulling retaliatory legal action against Apple, but that it hoped the business relationship between the two would go unaffected. Qualcomm, in its legal filing toady, spoke fondly of Apple and its effect on consumer technology: “Apple could not have built the incredible iPhone franchise that has made it the most profitable company in the world, capturing over 90 percent of smartphone profits, without relying upon Qualcomm’s fundamental cellular technologies,” Qualcomm said. “Now, after a decade of historic growth, Apple refuses to acknowledge the well established and continuing value of those technologies.” When asked for comment, Apple referred back to the comment it made in January: “For many years Qualcomm has unfairly insisted on charging royalties for technologies they have nothing to do with. The more Apple innovates with unique features such as TouchID, advanced displays, and cameras, to name just a few, the more money Qualcomm collects for no reason and the more expensive it becomes for Apple to fund these innovations.” Chance Miller @ChanceHMiller Chance covers Apple for 9to5Mac and contributes to 9to5Google, Electrek, and 9to5Toys.

Advertisement – Content Continues Below “Erie County suffered a rash of overdoses,” said Albany County Sheriff Craig Apple. “Must have been a bad batch. I always tell people these are not pharmacists that are mixing these,” Apple said. Erie County borders Canada, which is where W-18 was developed. The drug is often found in Canada and Richards said it has been tied to a number of overdoses there as well. She said a bad batch of heroin possibly laced with W-18 could be making its way down into New York and has been linked to a number of overdoses in the region, including a number in Columbia and Green counties. W-18 is not an opioid drug like heroin but it is often mixed with heroin and other synthetic drugs like fentanyl. “They do describe that it could be 10,000 times more potent than morphine is,” Richards said. “And 100 times more potent than fentanyl is.” Researchers said W-18 is similar to another designer drug used to tranquilize elephants called Carfentanil. Richards shared her concerns in a recent Facebook post. She has gotten more than 100 phone calls from the post, which has been shared over a thousand times. Sheriff Craig Apple said W-18 has not hit Albany yet but it has been found in the Capital Region. However, Apple said W-18 is only one of a handful of synthetic drugs causing alarm among law enforcement, including the elephant tranquilizer Carfentanil. “It’s a variety of these designer drugs that are out there,” Apple said. “You know your W-18's, your pink, your Carfentanil, your fentanyls.” Richards said Narcan (naloxone), a heroin antidote often used in heroin overdoses, will not reverse the effects of W-18 because it is not an opioid drug like heroin. That makes it even more lethal.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 11 April 2017 by Military News Qualcomm Files Answer and Counterclaims to Apple Lawsuit SAN DIEGO, April 10, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ:   QCOM) today filed its Answer and Counterclaims to the January lawsuit brought by Apple against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California.  Qualcomm’s filing details the value of the technologies Qualcomm has invented, contributed and shared with the industry through its licensing program, as well as Apple’s failure to engage in good faith negotiations for a license to Qualcomm’s 3G and 4G standard essential patents on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms. The filing also outlines how Apple: Breached agreements and mischaracterized agreements and negotiations with Qualcomm; Interfered with Qualcomm’s long-standing agreements with Qualcomm licensees that manufacture iPhones and iPads for Apple; Encouraged regulatory attacks on Qualcomm’s business in various jurisdictions around the world by misrepresenting facts and making false statements; Chose not to utilize the full performance of Qualcomm’s modem chips in its iPhone 7, misrepresented the performance disparity between iPhones using Qualcomm modems and those using competitor-supplied modems; and  Threatened Qualcomm in an attempt to prevent it from making any public comparisons about the superior performance of the Qualcomm-powered iPhones. Qualcomm seeks, among other things, damages from Apple for reneging on its promises in several agreements and to enjoin Apple from further interference with Qualcomm’s agreements with the companies that manufacture iPhones and iPads for Apple. „Qualcomm is the world leader in inventing and developing fundamental, ground-breaking mobile technologies that enable the worldwide mobile ecosystem. Today, Qualcomm’s patented technologies remain the primary value driver for mobile devices,” said Don Rosenberg, executive vice president and general counsel of Qualcomm. „The value of our inventions has been proven through hundreds of license agreements, negotiated and renegotiated over almost three decades, with virtually every significant handset maker in history, including the companies in Asia that have manufactured Apple iPhones and iPads. Over the last ten years, Apple has played a significant role in bringing the benefits of mobile technology to consumers with its popular products and services. But Apple could not have built the incredible iPhone franchise that has made it the most profitable company in the world, capturing over 90 percent of smartphone profits, without relying upon Qualcomm’s fundamental cellular technologies.  Now, after a decade of historic growth, Apple refuses to acknowledge the well established and continuing value of those technologies.  It has launched a global attack on Qualcomm and is attempting to use its enormous market power to coerce unfair and unreasonable license terms from Qualcomm.  We intend to vigorously defend our business model, and pursue our right to protect and receive fair value for our technological contributions to the industry.” View Qualcomm’s Redacted Answer and Counterclaims here.

April 7th has come and gone, but what of the several hundred million iCloud accounts that were supposed to be wiped? Has Apple paid the upstart hacker group known as the Turkish Crime Family? The group has posted the address of bitcoin wallet showing hundreds of bitcoins deposited on the evening of the deadline. As of yet there has been no news of wiped iCloud accounts, leaving many wondering whether Apple actually paid the ransom. It was only a few weeks ago that a group calling itself the Turkish Crime Family announced that it was in possession of the credentials of hundreds of millions of iCloud accounts, which it would wipe if Apple did not pay up. Apple later told SC that it had not been breached and that “The alleged list of email addresses and passwords appears to have been obtained from previously compromised third-party services.” Many speculated that instead of breaching Apple and getting access to hundreds of millions of Apple accounts on its own, the Turkish Crime Family had collected password and username combinations from other big breaches. It had taken those combinations and, given the proliferation of password reuse, launched them at iCloud accounts to see what stuck. Adding to that theory was Australian security researcher and creator of haveibeenpwned.com, Troy Hunt, who's research into the available data showed that 98 percent of the email addresses corresponded to those stolen in previous breaches such as MySpace, Lastfm and LinkedIn. The threats were often considered more light than heat as the group replaced its spokesperson and struggled to get a consistent message out to the public.  John Bambenek, threat systems manager at Fidelis Cybersecurity, told SC, “The current threat has all the hallmarks of a stunt. If they really have the ability to wipe iPhones then they would have wiped a few already as ‘proof of life'. There are always people who make unfounded threats to organisations in the hope of an easy payday.” After struggling to get its story straight about exactly how many accounts could be wiped and exactly how much the ransom was, the group decided on a final ransom of US$400,000 to be paid by 7 April 2017 into this bitcoin wallet. While a Turkish Crime Family spokesperson told SC that the funds might take a while to transfer, no funds appeared in that wallet. A separate wallet post by the family, showed a payment of 401.731 bitcoin paid in the early evening of 7 April. So did Apple pay the ransom? As of this writing, SC has not detected any reports of wiped iCloud accounts. Many reacted with disbelief, not quite accepting that a company as prestigious as Apple would kowtow to the threats of a previously obscure group of hackers. Who knows their BTC well enough to figure out what's actually gone on here? https://t.co/8bZ0KhHvE7 — Troy Hunt (@troyhunt) April 7, 2017 The Family claimed on Twitter that it had used a tumbler to obfuscate the origin of the payments, meaning that if Apple had paid the ransom it could not be traced back to the tech giant. Apple has not yet responded for comment.  This article originally appeared at scmagazineuk.com Related Articles Hackers threaten to wipe iPhones following iCloud breach Polymail for Mac wants to provide a cross-platform email experience to die for How to: Free space on your Apple smartphone Five popular cloud storage services compared Get your iPhone repaired by real geniuses Source: Copyright © SC Magazine, UK edition See more about:  icloud  |  ransom   Tweet Email this Print this Feedback   Readers of this article also read...   The 5 best VPNs for 2016 - make your web browsing more private     The most important features coming with iOS 9.3     Understanding the NBN: What is the multi-technology mix?     Review: Apple iPhone 6s     Review: ViewSonic VP2780-4K   More in Security (1 of 10 articles) NEWS Turkish Crime Family hackers claim 'victory' in iCloud ransom threats << Prev Next >> View all Security articles >> More in Security (2 of 10 articles) NEWS McAfee Labs highlights critical challenges to threat intel sharing << Prev Next >> View all Security articles >> More in Security (3 of 10 articles) NEWS McAfee breaks away from Intel Security with new mission statement << Prev Next >> View all Security articles >> More in Security (4 of 10 articles) NEWS 6 reasons you need to change your password right now << Prev Next >> View all Security articles >> More in Security (5 of 10 articles) NEWS IObit Malware Fighter 5 adds anti-ransomware engine, webcam protection << Prev Next >> View all Security articles >> More in Security (6 of 10 articles) NEWS OpenSSL change to Apache Licence v2.0 sparks concerns over author rights << Prev Next >> View all Security articles >> More in Security (7 of 10 articles) NEWS LastPass bug could allow hackers to steal passwords and execute code << Prev Next >> View all Security articles >> More in Security (8 of 10 articles) NEWS Star Trek-themed Captain 'Kirk' ransomware with Spock decryptor spotted << Prev Next >> View all Security articles >> More in Security (9 of 10 articles) NEWS RanRan ransomware blackmails victims into political dissent << Prev Next >> View all Security articles >> More in Security (10 of 10 articles) NEWS Mac antivirus software from ESET has RCE vulnerability - patch now! << Prev Next >> View all Security articles >> Most Read Most Discussed Powered by Disqus Latest Comments Powered by Disqus Latest Competitions   Win!!!

The government has reiterated its stance of not giving any relaxation to any foreign company from the compulsory 30% local sourcing norm, signalling that it would not extend such an incentive to iPhone maker Apple. “We do not want people coming to sell goods which can be manufactured without supporting the local ecosystem that we have,” commerce minister Nirmala Sitharaman said in reply to a Parliament question regarding Apple’s request. Here's a look at seven macro-economic triggers that may impact the market today: Sebi for overhaul of listed firms' board governance: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is in favour of a major overhaul of the way boards of listed firms discharge their duties, including for appointment and removal of directors, and also wants their audit committee to be empowered to identify future risks. While a 'guidance note' was issued last month by the Sebi on board evaluation at listed companies, there is a view that the regulator should come out with a new set of regulations to ensure greater compliance. The move assumes significance in the wake of recent boardroom battle at the Tata group and the controversy surrounding the reported differences between some promoters and the top management at Infosys. Railways to allow private companies to run own freight trains: Indian Railways will soon allow private companies to run freight trains from their own private terminals, a move which could potentially break the monopoly of the national transporter on the country's rail roads. Companies from sectors such as cement, steel, auto, logistics, grains, chemicals and fertilisers have evinced interest in having their own fleet under the special freight train operations scheme of the railways, a senior rail official said. If successful, it could pave the way for running private passenger trains eventually. Many of the private companies, including Tata Steel, Adani Agro, Kribhco and several others, have their own private terminals. ONGC to take control of HPCL for creating energy giant: Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) will take control of Hindustan Petroleum Corp (HPCL) as part of the government's plan to create an integrated public sector oil entity comparable with big global oil companies like Shell BP and Exxon, top government officials told ET. The move will stop short of a complete merger, which may take longer, but the purpose will be served with this step. ONGC's exploration functions will be integrated with HPCL's refining and distribution capabilities. Higher production costs impact manufacturing competitiveness: Rising production costs significantly impacted manufacturing competitiveness in the last few months, according to a survey. Industry body FICCI's latest quarterly survey on manufacturing suggests slight decline for the manufacturing sector outlook in the fourth quarter (January-March) of the last fiscal, as the%age of respondents reporting higher production and exports in fourth quarter have declined as compared to the previous quarter. The%age of respondents reporting fall in exports has reduced from 30% in the previous quarter to 18% in the January-March quarter. Some goods to be cheaper under GST: A number of goods such as cosmetics, shaving creams, shampoo, toothpaste, soap, plastics, paints and some consumer durables could become cheaper under the proposed goods and services tax (GST) regime as most items are likely to be subject to the rate of 18% rather than the higher one of 28%. India is likely to rely on the effective tax rate currently applicable on a commodity to get a fix on the GST slab, said a government official, allowing most goods to make it to the lower bracket. The GST Council has finalised a four-tier tax structure of 5%, 12%, 18% and 28% but has left room for the highest slab to be pegged at 40%. A committee of officials will work out the fitment and the council will take a final call at its next meeting on May 18-19. FIPB to take up 8 investment proposals on April 17 meeting: Inter-ministerial body FIPB will consider 8 foreign investment proposals on April 17, including that of Vodafone Mobile Services Ltd, Panacea Publishing Pvt Ltd and bioMerieux lndia Pvt Ltd. The Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB), headed by Economic Affairs Secretary Shaktikanta Das, is scheduled to meet on April 17. As many as 8 proposals are on the agenda, the Finance Ministry said in a meeting notice. Other investment proposals on the table include those of Bluetown lndia Pvt Ltd, Ghel Rendev lndia Pvt Ltd and Baxter Healthcare (Asia) Pte Ltd., Singapore. Business confidence at all time high: India’s business sentiment is bullish and expectations from the economy are at an all-time high, a business outlook survey carried out by the Confederation of Indian Industry has revealed. The CII Business Confidence Index (BCI) for the quarter to March has surged to a record high of 64.1as against 56.5 recorded in the previous quarter. Over 77% of respondents expressed optimism with regard to budget tax proposals and 52% expected the goods and services tax (GST) to have a positive impact on the economy after a year of its implementation. ...and in financial markets yesterday Rupee down: The rupee dropped a further 21 paise to 64.49 against the dollar today on growing safe haven appeal of the American currency after increased geo-political risks and higher chances of a tighter US monetary policy. Bonds down: Government bonds (G-Secs) slipped on selling pressure from banks and corporates. The 7.59% G-Secs maturing in 2026 fell to Rs 103.42 from Rs 103.45 previously, while its yield inched up to 7.06% from 7.05%. The 6.97% G-Secs maturing in 2026 declined to Rs 100.71 from Rs 101.03 previously, while its yield climbed to 6.86% from 6.82%. The 7.61% G-Secs maturing in 2030 also dipped to Rs 102.4325 from Rs 102.48, while its yield inched up to 7.32% from 7.31%. The 6.79% G-Secs maturing in 2029, the 8.60% G-Secs maturing in 2028 and the 7.68% G-Secs maturing in 2023 were also quoted lower to Rs 96.73, Rs 108.19 and Rs 103.2950, respectively. Call rates up: The overnight call money rates finished higher to 6.10% from last Friday’s level of 6.00%. Its resumed higher at 6.10% and moving in a range of 6.15% and 6.00%. The Reserve Bank of India, under the Liquidity Adjustment Facility, purchased securities worth Rs 74926 crore in 67-bids at the 3-day reverse repo auction at a fixed rate of 6% as on Apr 07, while it sold securities worth Rs 1255 crore in 2-bids at the overnight repo operation at a fixed rate of 6.25% as on Monday.

Even when there might be better alternatives available, consumers still flock to Apple partly because of the strength of its brand. That holding power, however, might be fading in the laptop market. At least if LaptopMag is to be believed. According to its Best and Worst Laptops of 2017, Apple is no longer the top laptop, having fallen from grace from #1 to #5. How do you gauge the strength of a brand as far as laptops are concerned? Short of doing a questionable survey, LaptopMag measures each brand’s performance in areas of features, customer support, design quality, and, of course, price. Those are the very things that Apple has been known for, which is how it managed to hold on to the top position for year. That is, until now. LaptopMag started its Best and Worst list in 2010 and, ever since then, Apple has held the number one spot. This year, however, it dropped to #5 and, to add insult to injury, is tied Acer. LaptopMag justifies this rating by saying how MacBooks have shown average performance not on par with their price. To make matters worst, at least for many, the latest MacBooks have either swapped traditional ports for Thunderbolt 3/USB-C or, in some cases, dropped them altogether. As for the other OEMs, Lenovo now leads the pack after a terrible 2015, where it ended in 6th place. Despite that, Lenovo still remains the largest PC vendor in the world. Not far behind it is ASUS, who has, more or less, been consistent near the top of the list. It has swapped places with Dell, who has fallen behind. Acer, as mentioned, is tied with Apple at fifth, climbing up three spots. It’s also interesting to see Microsoft now at the lowest spot, after entering the list for the first time last year in 7th place. LaptopMag says that, during this time, Microsoft has not put out any new Surface Book, so it was practically competing against newer and more powerful devices.

Qualcomm said on Monday that it filed its answers and counterclaims to the suit, seeking unspecified damages and to "enjoin Apple from further interference with Qualcomm's agreements with the companies that manufacture iPhones and iPads for Apple." The legal battle is the centerpiece of a high-stakes dispute between the world's most valuable company and the leading maker of processors in mobile phones. Qualcomm makes money from the chips themselves as well as from royalties when any device is sold that's based on its cellular standards. One-third of Qualcomm's revenue comes from licensing. Apple claimed in January that Qualcomm has been charging royalties for "technologies they have nothing to do with." Qualcomm said in its press release that the countersuit outlines how Apple breached and mischaracterized agreements and negotiations, interfered with agreements with device manufacturers, encouraged regulatory attacks against Qualcomm around the world, opted "not to utilize the full performance of Qualcomm's modem chips in its iPhone7," and threatened Qualcomm to keep it from speaking publicly about the better performance of iPhones with Qualcomm chips. show chapters Apple, Qualcomm battle heats up    Friday, 3 Mar 2017 | 5:24 PM ET | 02:17 "Apple could not have built the incredible iPhone franchise that has made it the most profitable company in the world, capturing over 90 percent of smartphone profits, without relying upon Qualcomm's fundamental cellular technologies," Qualcomm said. "Now, after a decade of historic growth, Apple refuses to acknowledge the well established and continuing value of those technologies." Part of the initial claim was that Qualcomm withheld nearly $1 billion from Apple as a retaliatory measure after Apple helped the Korean authorities in an antitrust investigation. Apple's business agreement with Qualcomm has included rebates from the chipmaker for exclusive use of its products. Qualcomm CEO Steven Mollenkopf said in February at a Goldman Sachs conference in San Francisco that he prefers the matter to be settled out of court and that, "you're probably not going to see us argue this out in press." The suit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California. --CNBC's Jon Fortt contributed to this report. (Clarification: This story was updated to say that Qualcomm licenses mobile technology beyond just chips.)

(2016 file photo/The Capital-Journal) This pipe shows the wear and tear over years, seen in edges that are thin in some areas but close to normal in others. Kansas gas companies want to accelerate their programs to replace aging and obsolete pipe. (2016 file photo/The Capital-Journal) Commissioners at the Kansas Corporation Commission last year examine some of the obsolete pipe, presented by Jerry Watkins, Black Hills Energy senior manager of technical services in Kansas. (2016 file photo/The Capital-Journal) A disagreement about who should bear the financial burden of replacing miles of obsolete Kansas gas pipeline that could become a public safety risk is dividing three commissioners on the state’s utility regulatory agency. A Kansas Corporation Commission meeting last week, which caused one watcher to mutter, “that was weird,” highlighted the division as commissioners Shari Feist-Albrecht, Pat Apple and Jay Emler briefly discussed their stances on the investigation they opened in March 2015. The commissioners must work in open meetings for such discussions, so Feist-Albrecht said she’d requested the agenda slot to articulate where she stood on the investigation that has rolled into its third year with no resolution. The purpose of the investigation was to delve into options for accelerating the replacement of obsolete materials in natural gas pipeline in the state. During hearings, Atmos Energy, which serves about 131,000 customers in 107 Kansas communities, testified that at its current rate of replacement, it would take the company 187 years to get all the obsolete materials out of the ground. Other KCC testimony has shown that about 23 percent of Kansas pipeline needs replacing. Feist-Albrecht wants to move ahead with a draft proposal, agreed upon by the utilities and KCC staff but opposed by the Citizens’ Utility Ratepayer Board, that sets up a five-year pilot program to address the issue. But Emler and Apple, both of whom were legislators when the Kansas Legislature approved a method to pay for gas pipeline replacement in 2006 by establishing a Gas System Reliability Surcharge, have issues with that. “My concern is twofold. One is public safety. And there appears to be one company that doesn’t appear to be all that concerned with public safety,” Emler said. “One hundred eighty-seven years means there wasn’t very good planning. There’s another company that says they only need nine years to get this accomplished. That means they have some pretty good planning. I am reluctant to reward a company that doesn’t plan because that’s what this is. This is rewarding their management team for not doing their job and taking it out on the ratepayers. So I have some serious reservations about dumping all of this on the ratepayers at this point in time. I don’t see that there’s much exposure to the company or to the shareholders.” Emler and Apple both pointed to promises they said gas companies made when they appeared in front of the Legislature to seek the GSRS as evidence that the companies failed to follow through with their plans. But Apple said his primary concern is that approving requests by gas companies for a new way to access funds for pipeline replacement is a movement toward “abandoning” traditional ratemaking in favor of surcharges. “We had testimony that the surcharges are not examined as closely as when you have a rate case,” he said, adding that the surcharges can become approved as a matter of course. “So I think the real question before the commission is do we want to abandon traditional ratemaking and go in a different direction? You just have to ask yourself is traditional ratemaking broken? If it is, why is it broken?” The commissioners adjourned the meeting with little discussion amongst the three. Jim Bartling, spokesman for Atmos Energy, said the deliberation last week was not what his company expected to occur. “We’ve been disappointed multiple times with this. But being the eternal optimists that we are, we still think that we can make something work,” he said. “I feel positive that staff wants something to be done; I feel positive that CURB would like to see something done as well, and we just have to try to continue to find out what is the real sticking point, and we just don’t know what that is yet.” Bartling stood by his company’s testimony and that of others participating in the investigation that Kansas pipelines are safe. “Every year, we do leak locating surveys,” he said. “We have constant people that patrol our lines to make sure we don’t have a leak on it. We like to say that safety is our No. 1 priority.” David Nickel, CURB consumer counsel, said CURB’s expert witness also testified the deteriorating pipes don’t raise immediate safety concerns. Like others, he is unsure what happens next. “We anticipate that the commission following the deliberation will issue an order. What that order will say is unknown,” he said. “We certainly don’t want to have anybody hurt in some type of catastrophic accident.” Asked who confirmed whether the gas pipeline is safe, Nickel said that ultimately that is the responsibility of the gas pipeline companies. “The commission has an obligation also to ensure that gas is efficiently and safely delivered, which means that their pipelines have to have integrity,” he said.

The agreement comes just two weeks after a group of Australian banks, which included Westpac, lost a fight to collectivity negotiate with Apple and boycott and iPhone maker’s payment platform, Apple Pay. The banks sought to bargain with Apple for access to the near-field communication (NFC) controller in iPhones and reasonable access terms to the App Store. This would enable Westpac, CBA, NAB, Bendigo and Adelaide Bank to offer their own integrated digital wallets to iPhone customers in competition with Apple’s digital wallet, without using Apple Pay. Samsung Pay is available on compatible Samsung devices including the Gear S3 smartwatch and soon-to-be-released Galaxy S8 and S8+ smartphones. Samsung has existing partnerships for the mobile payments service with Citibank for MasterCard and Visa credit card holders as well as American Express issued credit cards. Westpac Group, chief executive, consumer bank, George Frazis, said in a statement that Samsung pay is one of many digital solutions the bank is progressively introducing to its 9 million customers. Meanwhile, Samsung has announced that iris scan will feature as an authentication method for Samsung Pay on the new Galaxy S8 and S8+ smartphones. This will complement PIN and fingerprint as authentication methods, which are required before a user can make a transaction using Samsung Pay. Samsung is also launching an NFC provisioning feature, which will allow users to enter credit card details into Samsung Pay by tapping a card onto the bank of the device.

According to a new report from The Wall Street Journal, Foxconn this week offered up $27 billion for the business, a bid considerably higher than had previously been offered by companies such as Broadcom. Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case Last week, it was reported that Apple was among companies involved in a “bidding war” for Toshiba’s storage business, but it now seems as if reports confused Foxconn’s efforts as Apple’s. Nevertheless, Foxconn acquiring the business would be beneficial for Apple, as well. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe would like to see a Japanese company or a joint U.S.-Japan conglomerate purchase the business, but Foxconn’s offer would be hard to resist if it’s the most financially enticing. As for the value of Toshiba’s NAND business, today’s report states: Analysts have estimated the business’s fair value at between ¥1.5 trillion and ¥2 trillion. One person familiar with the matter said the next-highest bidder after Foxconn offered about ¥2 trillion when initial bids for the business were accepted in late March. In the past, Toshiba has stated that the two biggest factors in finding a buyer for its NAND business are the ability to close the deal quickly and the amount of the offer. It has also been reported that TSMC is interested in the business. As we’ve noted in the past, Foxconn acquiring Toshiba’s NAND unit would give the company a leg up on Samsung, which currently is one of the more dominant players in the NAND market. The move would allow Apple to further reduce its reliance on other companies and bring some of its NAND flash needs in-house. Foxconn’s interest in Toshiba’s NAND business comes following its separate acquisition of Sharp for some $3.5 billion. Owning both Sharp’s screen business and Toshiba’s NAND business would give Foxconn a strong position for future negations with Apple, especially as it struggles to combat slowing hardware sales all around. At this point, we’ll have to wait for an official announcement from Foxconn and/0r Toshiba, but it seems as if we’re slowly but surely approaching a final deal for Toshiba’s valuable NAND storage business.

The survey offers up a variety of different tidbits about the minds of teen shoppers, including some interesting information about Apple… Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case The latest teen survey from Piper Jaffray was released today and shows that the iPhone is at an all-time high in terms popularity. According to the data, 76 percent of surveyed teens owned an iPhone. That’s up from 74 percent during the last survey period and is an all-time high. Furthermore, 81 percent of surveyed teens said that their next phone will be an iPhone – up from 79 percent during the last survey period. iPhone ownership of 76% is our highest rating ever with upside remaining – 81% of teens say their next phone will be an iPhone. Piper Jaffray attributes the growth in iPhone interest to the upcoming iPhone 8, signaling a general excitement among teens for what Apple has in store for this year’s refresh. In terms of smartwatches, 13 percent of surveyed teens said they plan to purchase an Apple Watch within the next six months. That’s up 11 percent compared to the spring 2016 survey. Additionally, the Apple Watch remains the second most popular fitness band, lagging behind Fitbit. 71 percent of surveyed teens stated that they prefer Fitbit, while 10 percent said they prefer Apple Watch. The survey also offers up some tidbits about the app market, saying that 81 percent of teens use Snapchat at least once per month. The app remains the “favorite social media platform in terms of use and preference” for teens. 81% of teens use Snapchat at least once per month as it continues to be the favorite social media platform in terms of use and preference.

Outside the circles of Apple and the iPhone, the kind of induced behavior described in this article would be considered obsessive and harmful. But because it’s tech, perhaps, we celebrate it. Anderson Cooper looks at “What is “brain hacking”? Tech insiders on why you should care.” This is a long but fascinating report. And so, if you thought that perhaps a modest flip-phone would be inexpensive and secure for your kids, think again. It’s never going to happen. MacRumors has the story. The iPhone continues to be the most popular smartphone among teens, according to data gathered by investment firm Piper Jaffray in its most recent semiannual U.S. teen survey. 76 percent of teens surveyed own an iPhone, up from 69 percent in the spring of 2016… Jean-Louis Gassée has some interesting, high-level, thoughts on the new Apple File System (APFS). The title is a bit deceptive because we all care. That’s an essential part of his essay. “Apple’s New File System: Who Cares?” Did you know that the Opera browser has a free, built-in VPN? “How to Use the Opera Browser’s Built-In Free VPN on Your Mac.” Now if only Apple had thought of this…. It may be a bit too early to imagine what Apple’s next Mac Pro will be like. But that doesn’t keep the talented Andrew Cunningham at ars technica from ponderings. And great ponderings they are. “Imagining a new Mac Pro, the “iMac Pro,” and the future of Apple’s desktops.” Even if you’re not a technical or creative professional, you’ll find this one particularly interesting. The greatest Mac Ever? Speaking of Mac Pros (hint), Mac360 takes a trip down memory lane and recalls: “The Greatest Mac That Ever Lived.” I happen to agree. For now, anyway. Do you? Even though we’re starting to drool over Apple’s (presumed) 2018 Mac Pro, we know that we’re getting new iMacs later this year. And it looks like Apple will pour on the coals with these Macs that may include Xeon processors, 64 GB of ECC RAM and maybe even an 8K display. It seems like Apple is back on track with Macs we really, really adore and want. Not just routine updates. MacRumors has the story. And why do these halo Macs need to exist? Sebastiaan de With explains the need for powerful Macs for the pros. “Why Pro Matters.” We know these kinds of machines matter, but the author makes a particularly strong and eloquent case. Meanwhile, on the iPad front, many were expecting Apple to announce new iPad Pros in March or April. It looks like that won’t happen now. David Gewirtz: “I’m calling it: No spring Apple event this year.” If I had to guess, I’d surmise that Apple is going through the same process they did with the Macs: iPads that amaze us and make us drool. Bigger displays, more CPU/GPU power and more capability. Maybe we’ll see something at WWDC in June. That’s enough for now….

Maybe a sneak peak to WW#DC, but I’m skeptical of even that. The cheese grater Mac Pro the greatest Mac ever? It was the peak of the Mac Pro line, but I’d have to disagree it was the greatest. I’d vote for the MacIIC series. It brought colour and massive, for the time, power to the Mac line. You want to talk upgradeable? Apple offered an upgrade path to turn the IIcx into a IIci and even to a Quadra 700. It had card slots. You could put two HDD in it. It was the computer that made businesses look seriously at Macs.

Sure, we knew that Apple was going to drop support for 32-bit apps eventually, but noted developer Steven Troughton-Smith over the weekend seemed to confirm that Apple is about to make the App Store a tad more breathable later this year. Don't Miss: Behold: The Alexa-enabled smart home controller of your dreams In a pair of tweets sent over the weekend, Throughton-Smith relays that he’s heard rumblings that upcoming A-x chips won’t even offer support for 32-bit apps. Devs: I'm hearing very clearly iOS 11 won't have 32bit app support at all. Update legacy apps now if you want them to survive past September — Steve T-S (@stroughtonsmith) April 8, 2017 (…and it sounds like future A-series chips won’t even include 32-bit support. Wonder if that’ll free up any performance/die space?) — Steve T-S (@stroughtonsmith) April 8, 2017 Apple first transitioned to a 64-bit processor with the A7 on the iPhone 5s and now appears poised to kick 32-bit apps off of the App Store completely. This of course shouldn’t come as too much of a surprise as Apple has been gently nudging developers to update older apps for years now. In late 2014, for example, Apple began alerting developers that updates to existing iOS apps after June 1, 2015 had to include 64-bit support. This past January, with the first beta release of iOS 10.3, Apple began issuing a stark warning to users who fired up old 32-bit apps, alerting them that such apps “will not work with future versions of iOS” and that the app developer “needs to update it to improve its compatibility.” The demise of 32-bit app support on iOS has long been an inevitability, and now it appears that iOS 11 will finally offer up the final nail in the coffin. While this won’t impact most users, it may frustrate some folks who happen to enjoy or rely upon old apps that haven’t been updated in years. Alas, there is a price to be paid for forward progress. Either that or users can simply keep on using iOS 10 for years on end. It’s been estimated that there are currently 187,000 32-bit apps on the App Store. Come September of 2017, there’s good reason to believe they’ll be toast. 32-bit apps aside, some of the features iOS 11 will introduce include a completely revamped version of Siri, a long overdue Dark Mode, advanced augmented reality features (bolstered of course by 3D cameras on the iPhone 8), facial recognition, and support for multi-user FaceTime calls. With WWDC 2017 now less than two months away, we’ll hopefully start hearing some more tidbits about iOS 11 in the coming weeks.

The statement given at that time was the albums were taken down at the request of the artist, and given that Jay Z owns Tidal, a rival streaming service, we can’t say we were too surprised. However interestingly enough, some of Jay Z’s albums have found their way back onto Apple Music. Note that not all the albums have returned because as it stands, only “Reasonable Doubt” and the three “Blueprint” albums are the only ones available via Apple Music, meaning that there’s quite a bit of Jay Z’s discography that’s still missing. This is only for Apple Music as Spotify still does not appear to have any of Jay Z’s songs or albums available. On the other hand it seems that Google’s Play Music has more of the musician’s materials, so if you really want to listen to his songs then Play Music or Tidal will probably be where you’ll have to go to for now. It is possible that Jay Z’s albums returning to Apple Music could have been the result of negotiations between Apple and his label or with the artist himself. We’re not sure if his albums will ever find their way back to Spotify, but their absence combined with Jay Z’s popularity will no doubt represent a huge loss to Spotify. Filed in Apple >Audio.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Google in Negotiations with LG on new OLED Plant and Joint R&D Project Regarding Foldable Smartphones | Main April 10, 2017 While Apple is set to hit the Restart Button for the Mac Pro, it's the Smartphone Revolution Part 2 that's far more important   Laptop Mag is just the latest to jump on the bandwagon of dumping on Apple's MacBooks. The report noted that "After seven years of dominance, Apple's reign at the top of our Best & Worst Brands list is over, as the company sinks into a tie for fifth place."   Ever since Apple introduced their new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, the critics have come out loudly against it. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, super Apple fan wrote a report titled "How Apple Alienated Mac Loyalists." Mossberg ended 2016 saying that Apple's products weren't up to their historical standards; a nice way to say historical standards … under Steve Jobs.   To top it all off Apple decided to play Russian roulette last week and shoot themselves in the head by admitting that they blew the Mac Pro design and that it would take some time to reinvent their desktop line-up, especially the Mac Pro which could take at minimum until 2018.   Apple last week revealed that they'll be shifting gears for the Mac Pro and move to a modular design, something Microsoft had beaten them to months earlier. Ouch. On the other hand, hearing that Apple admitted that they had gone off course and were doubling down on new serious pro hardware was welcomed news for many.   A Second Storm Front on the Way   Apple's entire group of design and engineering teams are under the gun to not only bring back exciting Macs to market but also make sure that they're not too late in delivering a next-gen foldable smartphone over the next two or three years.   While Apple and Samsung have shown that they have a solid grasp on this coming device category through detailed patents (Samsung, Apple), it's here where Google and Microsoft want to beat Apple to market and pull the rug from under their feet. This could be the window of opportunity for both companies to finally deliver a blow to Apple's leading position in smartphones.   Just today we reported on Google being in negotiations with LG on a new OLED plant and joint R&D project for developing foldable smartphones. Is Google taking this new market segment seriously enough? Yes of course.   And coincidentally Patently Mobile reported on a number of Microsoft patents over the weekend showing that they too have patents on foldable and bendable smartphones and advanced features like 3D Touch, an advanced hovering technology that they've been working on for years.   It only takes one hit product to turn the tide for a company. For Apple it was the iPhone. It came out of nowhere and Microsoft didn't see it coming and even denied it had any relevance when it actually launched. Now Google and Microsoft are no doubt waiting for a similar break that could give them that single edge over Apple that could wound them if not take them down.   It's not to say that the sky is falling because it certainly isn't. Apple just delivered a record quarter. We also posted a report back in October titled "Microsoft's Big Boom in Surface Sales Last Quarter still Miles from Relevancy in Comparison to Apple's iPad." We then followed up with another report in December on how badly their Surface Studio desktop sales did over the holidays. So while Microsoft has been great at pounding their chest like Tarzan during press events, in the end, they've shown to deliver more bark than bite every time.   When it comes to Google, they've had had one Moon Shot project after another go down in flames, be it Google Fiber or Project Ara. And recent products like 'Google Home' and their Pixel smartphone have made close to zero impact on the consumer market. So Google has yet to deliver anything new that has changed the game and their 'Moon Shots' are more like Vaporware.   At the end of the day, another negative review of Apple's MacBook came in today, knocking Apple down a few pegs once again. Yet we learned last week that Apple got the message loud and clear that they missed the boat on pro hardware and they'll remedy it with great new iMac Pros this year and a new modular Mac Pro for 2018.   Yet when it comes to the next storm front, all tech companies will be on the starting line with a fresh start at the same time on hardware and it is unknown who will break from the pack to take the lead in the smartphone revolution part two. Apple's wild card could be smartly integrating Augmented Reality into the mix so that there's a holistic approach to this next market, but only time will tell.   So while the Mac Pro is definitely important, and we're all cheering Apple on, ensuring that they're deadly focused on the next wave of smartphones is far more important.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

[Photo: Flickr user Daniele Dalledonne] By John Paul Titlow04.10.17 | 6:45 pm I am, admittedly, worth far less than $610 million. So far be it from me to critique the business acumen of Shawn Carter—the rapper and entrepreneur better known as Jay Z—who Forbes says is worth about that much. But something about his latest move doesn’t seem destined for success. Over the weekend, most of Jay Z’s albums disappeared from Spotify and Apple Music, leaving his own Tidal streaming service as one of the few places where fans could stream his most popular releases, like Reasonable Doubt and The Blueprint. (For reasons that are unclear to me, most of Jay Z’s catalog returned to Apple Music earlier today, but it’s still missing from Spotify.) It’s obvious what Jay is probably going for here: By pulling his music from the biggest subscription music streaming service on the internet, Spotify, he hopes to give fans one more reason to choose his struggling service, Tidal. But will it work? The move comes at a moment of mixed fortunes for Tidal. The music service recently struck a deal with Sprint that boosted its value to $600 million and promised Tidal a wider audience through an as-yet-undefined music offering for Sprint mobile phone subscribers. It was a fortuitously timed partnership for Tidal, which has struggled to rise up beyond its self-reported 3 million subscribers, while Spotify breaks 50 million and Apple is catching up alarmingly fast. Earlier this year, a Norwegian newspaper accused Tidal of inflating its subscriber numbers, which may have been as low as 850,000 at the time of the 3 million subscriber claim. So, shoring up exclusive access to music by superstar artists like Jay Z should help reverse the trend, right? Not if you’ve been paying attention. In fact, hardly anyone knows this reality more intimately than Tidal. The service, co-owned by Jay Z and 15 other high-profile artists, has made music exclusivity a central part of its strategy.  The company’s name is practically synonymous with exclusive album releases from big name artists like Kanye West, Rihanna, and Beyonce. While last year’s string of Tidal exclusives helped inject the company’s name into the cultural dialogue (complete with an SNL skit about the service), it did little to eat away at Spotify and Apple’s dominance. Indeed, the limited streaming availability of Kayne West’s Life of Pablo seemed to drive many people back into the arms of illegal downloading  even as it inspired others to go sign up for Tidal. After half a year of high-profile exclusives, the recording industry seemed to change its tune about going along with the strategy last August after Frank Ocean snuck around his record contract with Universal’s Def Jam by fulfilling it with the short visual album Endless right before independently dropping another album, Blond, on Apple Music. This contractual sleight of hand—combined with the limited global reach of individual streaming platforms—reportedly helped push the already exclusive-weary Universal Music Group CEO Lucian Grainge toward his new policy: No more streaming exclusives with Universal artists. UMG’s move seems to mirror an industry sentiment, since there have been so few of these types of exclusives since last summer. New releases are a bit different from back catalogs. New albums can lead to a huge spike in listening by eager fans, while back catalogs help maintain a more consistent, day-to-day flow of streaming activity (and often, millions in revenue for well-known artists). Back catalogs are also, in theory, a selling point for music services. If you’re a huge Garth Brooks fan who owns an Amazon Echo, you’re likely to be drawn toward Amazon Music Unlimited with its exclusive access to Brooks’s catalog and cheaper monthly price for Echo owners. But by and large, this type of one-off catalog exclusivity doesn’t appear to do much to move the needle on subscriber numbers. Again, just ask Tidal. Until recently, Tidal offered exclusive streaming access to Prince’s entire catalog, but there’s no evidence yet that this move translated into millions and millions more Tidal subscribers, despite the shocking and unexpected death of the pop legend last year (death pretty much always results in a huge spike in sales, and more recently streams, for famous musicians). While Tidal certainly saw a jump in app downloads last April when Prince died and Beyonce’s Lemonade was released, the company hasn’t yet come out boasting much in the way of exciting subscriber growth in the last year. So, despite new releases from megastars like Kanye and back catalog exclusives from legendary acts like Prince and Neil Young, Tidal still hasn’t managed to come anywhere close to the subscribers of even the second-place streamer Apple Music (which notably launched in 2015, three months after Tidal). So what makes Jay Z think his albums will make a difference, especially this late in the game? It’s conceivable, though a bit far-fetched, to envision a Tidal-led coup against Spotify, in which some of Jay Z’s artist co-owners like Beyonce or Kanye West agree to start pulling their albums from other streaming services. With enough notable gaps in music libraries between services, this could become a more meaningful competitive difference between services. But between the contractual limitations artists have with their labels–not all musicians have as much control over their work, or where it is or isn’t available, as Jay Z does–and the fact that Tidal’s audience is so small, this scenario seems unlikely. More than anything, it would be ill-advised. It’s one thing for a popular artist to to “window”–industry jargon for delaying or restricting–their releases from streaming platforms (as Adele did) or hold out on streaming altogether (as The Beatles did until late 2015). It’s quite another for artists to yank their catalogs from streaming services after they’ve already been available (hello, Tay Tay). As streaming grows, this type of maneuver naturally becomes more hostile to music fans. Take Jay Z. As of right now, the rapper boasts 13 million monthly listeners on Spotify. That’s 13 million people who listen to Jay Z’s music regularly on Spotify (as opposed to more casual, occasional listeners) who suddenly have gaps in their music collections and grayed-out track titles on their playlists. For those listeners, this is an annoyance. Sure, some diehard Jay Z fans who were already considering a Tidal subscription might sign up for it, but it’s hard to envision many people doing that. Instead, some will supplement their Spotify listening with other artists in the service’s vast, seemingly unlimited sea of music. Others may get their Jay Z fix on YouTube. Some may pirate their favorite albums. But it’s safe to assume that a great many of them will never pay for two music services at once, since the content offering and features of most of these services are primarily the same. This is exactly why new album exclusives are so problematic and unpopular: They may have a theoretical benefit for one streaming platform in its war against its rivals, but the strategy essentially uses music fans as pawns in that battle and gives them new, unnecessary hoops to jump through. In essence, it’s a bunch of very rich people duking it out for dominance and screwing up your party playlists in the process. Jay Z’s disappearing act comes just days after Spotify announced a new deal with UMG that will allow the label to hold new releases back from Spotify’s free tier temporarily. It’s a compromise in which Spotify reverses its long-held protection of the free, ad-supported tier in order to placate the music industry, which has long been frustrated by the lower revenue generated by free streaming–the ad-supported tier earns more money for the labels. Giving artists and labels the option to “window” new albums (and who knows, perhaps back catalogs in future deals with the labels as well) from the free tier is a reasonable compromise that lets labels earn more from new releases and lessens the need for more listener-hostile exclusives and other industry turf war tactics. At least, let’s hope that’s the case. About the author John Paul Titlow is a writer at Fast Company focused on music and technology, among other things.

That’s the company Apple partnered with for iPhone and iPad graphics processors before deciding to go it alone—and more than 20 employees have already left to join the Cupertino-based company. Apple is on the hunt for more GPU designers About a dozen job listings for GPU designers based in Apple’s UK Design Center have been posted, according to the Telegraph. UK-based Imagination is reportedly concerned Apple intends to hire away more of its staff. Word surfaced last week that Apple is moving away from Imagination for its mobile device GPUs and will start designing its own. Imagination jumped into legal posturing mode saying Apple can’t create its own GPUs without first licensing some of its patented technology. The company said in a statement, “Apple has not presented any evidence to substantiate its assertion that it will no longer require Imagination’s technology, without violating Imagination’s patents, intellectual property and confidential information.” Apple has already hired 25 people from Imagination over the past two years, including the company’s former COO John Metcalfe. Instead of buying the company, it seems Apple decided to simply hire away its talent instead. Apple’s Hiring Spree is Imagination’s Bad Luck Imagination Technologies is taking it on the chin in a big way because more than half its revenue comes from Apple. That’s a big loss to face, plus the company has been losing key talent to Apple thanks to hiring for the past couple years. The salt in the wound came on Friday when Imagination’s stock tanked last Friday after word of Apple’s plans came out. At this rate, Imagination is faced with the prospect of Apple moving to its own GPU designs within two years, and the possibility of a long patent infringement legal fight. The company has already made it clear litigation is a possibility if Apple doesn’t pay to license its patent protected technologies. Unfortunately for Imagination, Apple has no doubt factored that into its plans and is ready for what ever legal fight may be coming. Considering the company is looking at the prospect of losing half its income while bleeding away even more talent, the road ahead seems pretty rough.

Featuresby Robert Triggs9 hours ago 7 385 5 News earlier today suggests that Google is looking to sure up some additional OLED production over at LG with a cash boost of $880 million (1 trillion won). While unconfirmed by either party, the rumor suggests that at least one major smartphone manufacturer is becoming a little concerned about the display supply outlook over the coming year or more and there are several indications that an OLED supply crunch could be on the way. One of the largest potential contributing factors to a shortage of OLED availability is the upcoming iPhone 8. Apple has long been rumored to finally be making the move over from LCD to OLED display technology and, of course, such a move would immediate add millions of additional orders into the OLED supply chain. A report earlier in the year suggested that Apple would require around 14 percent of Samsung’s production capabilities to fulfill projected demand for its iPhone 8. See also: Global AMOLED and memory shortages predicted for 2017 November 10, 2016 Samsung is expected to be the sole display manufacturer for the iPhone 8, and Apple could take up 14 percent of the company's production capabilities. This would make it tough for other OEMs to find sufficient supply. Samsung is expected to be the sole display manufacturer for Apple’s iPhone 8, as it’s currently the largest small form factor OLED panel manufacturer. Samsung is estimated to use up about 56 percent of the market’s OLED panels for its range of Galaxy smartphones, including its Galaxy S flagships and A series mid-range phones. Between its own requirements and a big order from Apple, Samsung’s other partners, which include Oppo, Vivo, and others, may have increased competition for panel contracts. After accounting for its own demand and the Apple rumor, Samsung is estimated to only have enough capacity left for 50 million AMOLED panels for other manufacturers in the next year or so. This is likely behind Google’s decision to approach LG rather than the market leader. LG has been investing heavily to ramp up its OLED production line in order to catch up with Samsung, but there are likely still some supply contracts up for grabs. Google’s reported $880 million investment would be enough for LG to build a new production line dedicated to mobile panels. The company already has two flexible OLED plants, which LG has announced serious investments into already this year. It’s been suggested that Google’s request could be manufactured at the E5 plant in Gumi City, South Korea. LG is currently the largest manufacturer of large TV OLED panels, but it still catching up with Samsung’s lead in mobile panel sized production. Samsung currently accounts for 95 percent of mobile OLED market. With supply being snapped up by big players, we may not see as many small manufacturers, such as OnePlus, be able to secure OLED panels this year. The other major factor putting a squeeze on OLED supply is the falling production costs and improved yields, which have brought the costs of this technology down to the price of traditional LCD. Last year the prices between these two mobile display types became compatible, leaving mid-range manufacturers in particular with more options to consider. A number of lower cost smartphones have already shipped with OLED panels, but these have been quite reliant on excess supply from Samsung. The falling cost of OLED panels has increases OEM interest, which has put additional pressure on the supply chain. This extra demand from the mid-tier combined with major orders from big players is likely to reduce the availability of these panels, especially from the largest manufacturers. This is already having a knock-on effect for smartphone manufacturers. Asus is reportedly struggling to secure display supply from Samsung for its mid-range products. The company has instead turned to Chinese panel manufacturers like Tianma Micro-electronics and BOE Technology Group to find the units it needs. However, these panel producers aren’t expected to come online in a meaningful way until 2018, and even then yields will take time to bring production into full swing. According to industry reports, Oppo and Vivo have managed to secure supply from market leader Samsung, but Huawei has not been able to guarantee a share that meets the company’s requirements. If true, Huawei may be able to source additional units from other manufacturers or simply limit OLED technology to its flagship models, but it could also be faced with the choice of simply having to pick LCD instead. HTC is another major manufacturer rumored to be interested in picking up OLED technology for its handsets, but has been similarly out of luck. See also: Smartphones with AMOLED displays catching up on LCDs March 1, 2017 Samsung controls most of the supply, so a highly successful Galaxy S8 could leave a shortage for other OEMs and/or waiting times for some consumers. Overall, global OLED demand is expected to climb around 44 percent this year, meaning that the industry will need to produce some 530 million units throughout 2017 to avoid a shortage. Despite major investments, the supply chain isn’t expected to grow quickly enough to leave manufacturers the 10 percent buffer typically required to cater for any swings in demand. In other words, better than expected demand for a major smartphone release, such as the Galaxy S8 or iPhone 8, or factory issues could result in a supply shortage. For us consumers, a display supply shortage could mean a number of things. Firstly, that we may not see as many smaller manufacturers offering smartphones with OLED displays this year, as the larger manufacturers buy up supply contracts from Samsung. Although, smaller runs may still be able to find supply from some of the smaller Chinese display manufacturers. Secondly, a highly successful launch of the Galaxy S8 or the rumored OLED iPhone 8 could potentially lead to handset shortages. Of course these phones aren’t launching at the same time, and the companies will have set aside units and production capacity to cater for expected sales. However, we’ve seen companies have to delay launches in certain regions in the past when exceedingly high demand outstrips supply. Fortunately an OLED supply shortage should only be short lived, with a two year projection seemingly the worst case scenario. Samsung and LG are investing heavily in additional production lines that will increase output later in 2018. Furthermore, a number of Chinese panel manufacturers will be increasing their own output substantially in 2018 too, meaning that we could see a lot more OLED and AMOLED smartphones in the coming years.

The iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus may not deliver super screen resolutions, but they hit the right notes for many buyers and with iOS 10 there are even more reasons the iPhone is better than Android for many users. iPhone competition includes the Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge, One Plus 3, the LG V20 and other phones that deliver a bigger challenge for Apple — but there are still places where the iPhone is clearly better than Android and iOS 10 is better than Android Nougat. Many of these could change with the Galaxy S8 and the LG G6 later this year, but for now – iPhone has an edge. You need to learn what the iPhone does better and how Apple delivers a better experience than Android to see if an iPhone is the best smartphone for you in 2017. Here are 15 reasons the iPhone is better than Android phones in 2017. Use our list of reasons the iPhone is better than Android to figure out which new smartphone you should buy this year. Read our iPhone 7 review to learn what sets this phone apart from the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. You can buy the iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus at a discount with the best iPhone 7 Black Friday deals. Read: Siri Tips & Tricks Even if you think you know which phone is best, you might be surprised to learn about all the reasons the iPhone is better than Android. iPhone Apps Are First and Better Looking Most of the popular apps are on both platforms, but many top games and apps still come to iPhone first. We’re seeing more apps come to both Android and iPhone at the same time, but there are still way more iPhone only apps that we see than Android only. When apps are available on iPhone and Android we still often see a better design on the iPhone version than on Android. This is something that still rings true in 2017. For example, we still see some new Snapchat features and Spotify features come to iPhone before Android. iPhone owners are enjoying Super Mario Run, but the Super Mario Run Android app is still on the way. Read: Best iPhone Apps Apps are an area where the gap is closing, but the differences still exist and are noticeable. We also see Apple take better care of the App Store. Recently they purged 47,300 apps from the app store that were simply bad or abandoned. Fast iPhone Updates for All iPhone owners enjoy quick and regular iOS updates for the iPhone no matter what carrier they use. Faster updates are available for all iPhone owners. Android updates take months to arrive on all the devices. After an Android device is 18 months old, you may need to wait for a new Android smartphone to get the latest software. Apple delivers iPhone updates to devices that are three years old. Apple offers iPhone 4s iOS 9 support. It is unheard of to see support for an Android phone that old. iOS 10 is available for the iPhone 5. When you look at Android devices support ends much faster. Google promises at least two years for Nexus devices, which means Nexus 6 support ends this fall and the Nexus 6P in September 2017. Google may push farther out, but it is not a guarantee. Other Android device manufacturers don’t typically match the longevity of iOS updates. On top of the added update support, Apple does not allow carriers to hold up the updates. As soon as the update is available from Apple it is available on every carrier. If you really want Android Nougat, you may need to simply buy a new Android phone. Works Great with All Your Devices If you own an iPhone, iPad and Mac your information flows smoothly from one device to the other. You can quickly sync photos to all of your devices, answer a phone call on your iPad or Mac and send text messages from your other devices. There is also support for Handoff that allows you to start a task on your iPhone and continue on your iPad or Mac. The iPhone works great with the iPad and Mac. Overall the connectivity between these devices is something Android doesn’t yet match without relying on a collection of third-party applications and services to hodgepodge together a similar feature. Sharing a file from your iPhone to your Mac is also faster and easier thanks to AirDrop. This built-in service sends the file wirelessly directly to the Mac, even when there is no other WiFi around. Continue to Next Page. 1 2 3 4 290 Responses 05/27/2015 Dave Reply Your article is good but the major and best reason to buy an iPhone over anything else is because it’s an APPLE. You simply can’t go wrong. I own an iPhone 5, iPad Mini 3, MacBook Pro, iMac, and Apple TV. I would not even consider anything else, especially something from that “G…” company which I abhor. I won’t even use their search engine. Same goes for anything from that software manufacturer that, well, just call it “MS). Try calling any other manufacturer for support and see if you can understand what they are saying. I suppose I am bias toward Apple but after nearly 30 years of dealing with computers of all sorts I guess my opinion is warranted. 07/17/2015 gabe Reply why people like iphones? I never understood why anyone would like to give control to another company of what you do with their device. why force u to follow MEDIA SHARING and digital rights media? you cannot torrent on iPhone, nor transfer music and videos without ITunes or a paid online service in iOS. I hate that Samsung s6 tried copying apple iPhone. no microsd slot and integrated battery. CMOn! 04/06/2016 Sai Reply You ever used apple ? 07/05/2016 greentoe Reply http://gtoe.me/l/7A0q-A-04r 02/27/2017 david Reply yea 03/31/2017 bitchmaster64 Reply You don’t know me, but my name’s Sai. I’m just the O’Hare delivery guy. But it seems like trees might be worth a try, so I say let it grow. 03/04/2017 Evie Reply It is simply the portability. I have watch ,I go to the gym. I have apple computer and I can receive my phone calls there and iMessages. It crashes less often than microsoft does. I can contact apple support, whenever I want. The other time ,the bluetooth in my iPhone did not work, I contacted tech support midnight and they were available. We could not fix the problem. They called me the next day and told me to go to the nearest store and pick up a brand new phone. One more thing, my iPhone was out of warranty for 165 days. They told me they cared about customer satisfaction. When I called microsoft in order to talk to me they wanted $250. Now, compare 12/02/2015 Zombieknight Productions Reply You’re literally so idiotic that you can’t spell the full name of a company. Only Apple, cuz you’re an I sheep. You can go very wrong. If people were smart these days, they would understand that iPhones are unequivocally not the right choice for them. You wouldn’t recommend anything else, because it is too limited and unintelligent to use anything else. Stop trying to influence other people to buy garbage phones and devices 05/12/2016 Nancy Reply Why are u being a hypocrite calling someone idiotic for not knowing how to spell the company name right when some of ur sentences don’t even make sense. Apple doesn’t have any competition be used it is the best phone to get. 07/13/2016 Rona Reply First of all, don’t criticize someone for calling someone else idiotic when you can’t even use proper spelling or grammar. Second, Apple is all marketing. There is nothing special about it. Android offers phones that have expandable memory (and guess who doesn’t?) and better high-speed data services. iPhones die extremely quickly, you can’t use iTunes on any other devices, whereas Android platforms are available on all devices, the picture quality on an iPhone is pathetic compared to Androids, and Apple products are majorly behind in technology. The latest update for an iPhone came out two years ago for an Android. Apple has a set array of things it can do, and you can’t customize or change that. But if you want a high-end technology phone, choose an Android. It does so much more and you can customize and change its features. I have had both an iPhone and an Android phone. 09/14/2016 Abhishek well,mam i am an android user and i would like to say that iphones are the best because when you buy an android first it will give you good performance but after one month it will start hanging and work slow and that is same with every android devices.and their are so many android malware which also affect performance. Iphones are the best, secure and stable. 09/15/2016 Me Stay butthurt, loser ; ) 12/04/2016 jgames “nothing special about it” fastest phone ever 3d touch very good camera looks very nice “nothing special about it” why do we need expandable memory on iOS? gime a few reasons for that. “better high-speed data” give me your source for all this information. iphones die extremely quickly? how? do you even have an iphone? iphones have much better standby and screen on time with heavy usage than android. you cant use itunes on other devices, yes, but ios wants to keep it ios exclusive because their services are one of the major selling points for them. android platforms are available everywhere, but google software is usually preferred to ios software. pathetic picture quality? wut? iphone pictures wont lose quality when you zoom in and support much more colors than any old android camera. android cameras are very nice as well, though. “apple are behind in technology” a lot of people say this but it’s actually quite the opposite. 3d touch was very innovative, its like a ‘right click’ for your phone. the latest iphone update did not come out 2 years ago. you seem like you have no idea what you’re talking about and just spouting nonsense. apple can do a lot of things without customization, but what customization do we really need? people always saying android is more customizable but never give examples, and when they do its “homescreen.” moving home screen icons around is a pretty useless feature tbh android isnt more high end tech than iphone and i dont see how much more it does. you havent even explained how it can in your comment. so please use common sense before spouting nonsense 02/27/2017 Gage iPhones are by far the better phone. I’ve had android phones for most of my life but i bought an iPhone 6 about a year ago and now I have the 7 and I can’t imagine going back. Android is slow, every button you push there’s a lag before it actually opens the app or whatever you pushed. Also, every android I’ve ever had has had terrible battery life, it never lasts the full day but my iPhone almost always does. And my last point, android automatically installs like 10-20 on your phone that you cannot delete no matter how hard you try. Apple has 3-5. Yes, android has a port for SD cards, but what good is that if a large amount of your memory is made up of apps you don’t want. You’re entitled to your opinion but I advise that you get yourself an iPhone 7 and keep an open mind. I’m fairly certain you realize how much better it is 05/23/2016 Anthony Reply Not very nice. Also, Apple is just as good as Android, theres aspects that one company has over the other, and vice versa, so the best thing to do is just to test out both and find your favorite and use it because Android and Apple’s problems and advantages weigh out each other so it really just matters which one you like the most so just use the one u like and stop arguing. 08/19/2016 Zane Reis Reply I prefer Android because of the coustomization it has to offer. I prefer to be able to change change almost every aspect about my phone and making it the way “I” like it, not the way Apple likes it. I like the coustomization while others find it chaotic, confusing, and would rather it be (in their eyes) simpler. 05/26/2016 Billy Reply Says the one who has Zombie Knight as their username. 07/18/2016 Nate Pauley Reply That’s an interesting rather stupid mindset to have and it makes me reflect on the time I had those same views. It took me 6 years as an android user to eventually realise how inferior it is to iOS. Android is plagued with fragmentation, so much that not even customisation can save it. There should be a term that describes blindsided android followers, if there is one then I’d like to know it. iOS is solid, stable, secure and much more better looking than android – Apple pays exquisite attention to the finer details and they will continuously improve on the irritating nooks and crannies so many people mention in the comments. The best part is APPLE USERS CAN ACTUALLY BE A PART of the firmware updates and have assurance in a better OS experience overtime. I’ve had my S6 for a year and I’ve only managed to have one firmware update that took 7 months to deliver. I can only give credit to android for the premium android devices such as my S6, until then the physicality of a device alone cannot make me shift in the near future. I want a solid experience, not a hollow one. 08/02/2016 Adarsh Reply Hi, Your comparison of iphone with S7 is not right because in case of iphone both hardware and software are developed by Apple and in case of S7 developer of hardware is Samsung and developer of software is Google. I use Nexus 5 phone, hardware and software both developed by Google and manufactured by LG and ipad Air2 by Apple. Both devices update periodically whenever updates are released and I am happy with both. 09/15/2016 Me Reply LOL stay laughably buthurt/beyond tasteless loser Fandroid X ) 03/02/2017 xxLoser123xx Reply Wow you know how to use a Thesaurus. 03/06/2017 Sally Fallis Reply Wow! I AM impressed! You know about the Thesaurus!! I didn’t think anyone under 50 ever heard of it anymore! 12/17/2015 Noah Reply This comment, as well as this article are laughable at best. Coming from a person who owns all major Apple products but frequently bounces back and forth in the smartphone department, I don’t see how any of these actually make the iPhone “better” than android. I would say the only point that is valid is the support Apple has from app developers. It’s pretty easy to see that apps on the iPhone can be “prettier” than apps on android with the extra animations, and quick gestures. However even that is relative, since iOS gives you security and “pretty animations” but gives of freedom and functionality in the process. I still can’t tell you which phone is better, as that all is personal preference and I really don’t care which phone is “better”. I just want a phone that does what I want it to do without too many hiccups (which is why I’ll never buy another Samsung device). For now, I’d say in terms of productivity, the iPhone is great if you are a person who needs iMessage, FaceTime, and the Apple ecosystem to feel comfortable doing work. While I believe most android phones will get work DONE. With the amount of third party apps available to you on the play store, multi window, Google now on tap, and other gestures. I have always felt an android is phone is more a workhorse while the iPhone is king of simplicity. 05/23/2016 Anthony Reply Congrats, you just wasted about 5-15 minutes of your time typing out this article because its not going to convince anyone.

So, he’s not being biased. http://www.gottabemobile.com/2016/05/26/android-vs-iphone-2016-android-better/ 11/10/2016 Pixleboy2 Just because he has another article doesn’t mean this one’s biased 01/30/2017 Selenia Thank you for that. This article and many commenters made me want to vomit thinking he was so biased and the sheep just followed along. I can give numerous reasons Android is a better OS, but that is not the point. However, some Android devices suck. Most of the detractors comments are true of stock Samsung devices. Samsung may be the most popular, but far from the best. They make pretty good hardware, but the software begs for rooting and custom ROMS. I am typing from a Nexus 6P, which is pure Android. Google does good with monthly updates, too. But I am using Pure Nexus, the best reason for owning a Nexus/Pixel device, with ElementalX kernel for out of this world stability, smoothness, flexibility, and battery life. Unless I use hotspot(tunneled over VPN), I only have to charge every 2 days under pretty heavy use. PN is actually updated more than Google’s stock and usually delivers security updates within a day of release, which is faster than Google often rolls it out to most users. 01/06/2016 Leo Keys Reply Why would someone else go with a product by Google, NVidia (I will come back to them), or Microsoft; over that “A…” Company (Repeat)? The reason people would use nVidia over the AMD (god I hate AMD’s Products) GPU’s found in Mac products? They want a more powerful GPU. Apple says that their “PC’s” are better and use top-notch products. Why don’t they use the GeForce GTX 980m in the MacBook Pro? Why don’t they use Quadro cards over FirePro cards? Because Apple doesn’t know anything about Graphics. As for iMac’s I have no clue why some use an i5. Apple products thermal throttle a lot. Android is secure with the right Antivirus programs. It is also much more free to do what ever you want. But, because your an iSheep, you can’t process facts that favor the other side of the grass. Guess your life must be happy, getting råpēd by Apple, every year and paying thousands on eye candy. Why use Google or Bing over Yahoo? Yahoo sucks, that’s why. Face the fact that Yahoo and other search engines are inferior to Google. Apple products are trash and are eye candy for white girls (Starbucks and that stuff). 01/06/2016 Pedro Coimbra Reply Now you have to bring the Nvidia/ATI war? What, the iphone/android isn’t enough for you? Dude AMD cards are equally powerful, no matter how much you “hate them”. Why Apple chose AMD? Maybe prices, power consumption, price/performance ratio, easier to adapt to their hardware, who knows? But a company such as Apple (you can write the complete name, it won’t bite you) so adept at optimization doesn’t make these decisions lightly, they HAVE a reason, one that you *don’t know*, but that’s irrelevant. About the i5, a reason for the apparent lower specs must be because of how streamlined and optimized the OS is, instead of being made to work with zillions of combinations of brands, boards, peripherals. So what you want in hardware to cope with the software, was made achieved with the fat-free software. «Android is secure with the right Antivirus programs», well I guess any system is secure with the right Antivirus programs, isn’t it? but never 100%. How about a system that doesn’t need antivirus, just a little inteligence from it’s user? Android safe… yes, keep dreaming, it’s not as the net isn’t filled with cases of security holes and breaches of android. If you reply to my I advise you right now to not bringing ATI/Nvidia stupid nerdish arguments or sheep mentality, about mobile platforms and geekinesses like that, because I simply don’t have the patience.

How can it be if 85 percent of the market is Android, and it much more easier to write an app to Android? It’s not making any sense and wrong. Also other things like sharing things and integration compared to Apple products only. Almost every line in this article is not right. 12/12/2016 Cjros Reply LOL, thank you for making me 100℅ sure that Android is way better than newest IOS. Your arguments are so poor and naive :). The only thing youve got right is the SD expansion, but it is not any issue at all :). Thank you, my hero :) 12/15/2016 Debapriyo Reply You are so dangerously biased towards Apple that some of your words make so sense and are outright stupid. I have no problems with you choosing an apple product but lol. You don’t use Google search engine? Then you are missing out. Their search engine is still the best and most reliable and miles ahead of other search engine options. Google Maps way better than Apple Maps. Every tiny feature Apple introduces in the new version of IOS, Google had it in android 2 years back. I myself love some Apple products and appreciate the high standards of quality they incorporate in their products but please don’t even compare Apple with Google. Apple just makes iphones, macbook and some fancy toys. Google makes much much more and is the spearhead of IT innovation today. Be a fanboy but don’t be an idiot. 03/22/2017 ComputerGeek Reply you’re weird 06/23/2015 Chris H Reply Some of these reasons for being better than Android phones are oxymoronic. An extended warranty and readily available Apple Stores suggest that the iPhone is prone to bugs and damage. I will stick with my G3 because I know if I drop it it won’t shatter and I won’t have to give more money to Apple either for a case and/or a screen fix. There is a reason there aren’t Android stores out there. Because their phones don’t nearly have as many issues in my opinion. Consider Chevrolet and Honda. The Honda will last and is just as nice if not nicer than the Chevy, which will not last nearly as long and will force loyal customers to buy yet another Chevy. 07/27/2016 eiendiaies your_ufo Reply I would love to hear your comment now about your G3. Android stores are not because android companies dont give a f.ck about costumers, they just improve SPECS SPECS AND SPECS but where is NO improving quality. Why for example iphone 12 megapixel camera can beat sony xperia 23 megapixel camera, why iphone 1500 mah battery last longer than lg 3000mah, why fingerprint on iphone works much better than samsungs? And whats a practical difference between 640p vs 2k smartphone screen? Damn the real sheeps dont understand what apple cares about costumers and they stay at same screen resolutions because they just dont need to improve screens, android companies just keep adding numbers on specs. But where is quality improvment? You say iphone works better because of lower resolution screens, but than why androids keep improving resolutions but forget about older android users? I am ex samsung and LG user, rubbish costumer services, if android die than i must wait couple weeks for replacment, if somethin happen with iphone i know where is apple store and dealing with them in same day. Price stays high for iphone for a real reason. Iphone is not about SPECS, its about quality in every aspect. 09/30/2016 Linked Devices Reply The issue with iPhones that I hated was that the only way you could fix any glitch that would inevitably crop up is by factory resetting the phone each and every time. It’s such an annoying and time consuming process having to set everything back up again. When I made the switch to Android I was really impressed by how stable and self contained it was. Whenever there was a glitch it was limited to that particular app and you could simply reinstall it and it’d be fixed. I’ve never encountered any systemwide issues such as the iPhone misc storage bug that would happen to me all the time with the 6s. Apple does a great job hiding all of its glitches by simply not providing any prompts. Apps just disappear when they crash. It’s terrible. I know a lot of people with the misc storage bug to this day and don’t know it. They just think they’re out of space all the time because they need a new phone.. 09/30/2016 Linked Devices Reply I lol’d at how much superior the author thought the lightning cable was because it was reversible. You have a fifty fifty chance at it if you do it blindly but most cables have a dimple on top to make sure you get it even time. It’s the most versatile cable, it’s simple, affordable and it just works.

Some of these were acceptable reasons, but most were not. My wife is using an iPhone 6, and I have the Galaxy S6 edge. We both agree that my phone is far superior in terms of speed and screen resolution, but her camera, even being spec-deficient to my Android, seems as good as, or even better somehow. I like your point on the updates all rolling out at once, but almost every other “point” you made about iPhone being better boils down to one thing: lots of your friends have iPhones. That’s it. That’s the selling point, and the basis of this article. “iPhone apps look better.” – That’s completely relative. Lots of apps do look better, but they generally are paid apps that are free in the Play Store. “Works for all your devices” – So what? I thought this was a phone article. Android works with all your crap too. “No Carrier bundled apps” – I dont know how that’s a selling point, but okay, you win. Bloatware is an issue on android. “Sharing to other iPhones”/”Better resell” – Your friends all have them, so you should too. Then you can sell them to other friends who have older ones and make more money. Ridiculous. Yeah, you get a few more bucks for them, so that means you should have an inferior phone? Who buys a phone because of resale value? Preposterous. “Lightning cable is miles better” – My S6 charges from nothing to 40% in 10 minutes. iPhone can’t do that. I understand that the cable may be good, but “miles better” is a stretch. “Apple Stores” – So? I don’t even understand how this is a point in your article. Go to best buy, it’s the same crap. “Touch ID”/”Headphone controls” – Those both work flawlessly on a good number of high end android devices as well. “iMessage, Facetime, blah blah” / “Share apps easily” – All your friends have these, so you should too, or they’ll laugh at you. “Siri works better than Google Now” – Google Now isn’t Siri. That shouldn’t be a comparison. It’s not trying to be Siri. It’s a voice search, and that’s it. Siri works, but it doesnt work “better” than anything else, because there’s nothing to compare it to. If you like having Siri, good. “Notifications are better” – No, they’re not. Android’s notifications work exactly the same. Now don’t get me wrong, I’m not saying iPhone isn’t better, I’m just saying you haven’t proven that it is here in the slightest. Both OS’s are very well made, and the playing field is far more level than any avid IOS or Android user wants to admit. 07/30/2015 Helene Reply Excellent comment. I totally agree with you. 08/07/2015 Sam Reply DONT throw away your s6 edge… get an iphone but if you can use them interchangeably 07/15/2016 quenchybro Reply lol hi sam 10/09/2015 Palbo Reply I disagree. Bloatware is not really a problem on Android; any respectable company will only install commonly used and necessary apps like the Play Store and Gmail. If you are buying a phone that will leave your wallet intact (and still deliver better specs in every single measurable way than an iPhone 6, such as the lenovo k3 note) from a less known company which may allow bloatware, you can easily root the phone and uninstall it. I do agree with your other points, though! 05/27/2016 ZENCKPRI Reply Phinfankid you are completely right. I agree with everything you said. You are probably the only logical person who has commented so far. Also the iPhones storage is just a scam to keep people paying and buying more storage. Unfortunately the Samsung Galaxy s6 also removed the microsd slot, but luckily Samsung got it sh*t together with the Samsung s7, which in my opinion is the best phone. 07/12/2016 10beasts Reply You really explained the situation very well! Loved it. 07/09/2015 D Reply This article compares Apples to apples. Your references to Android are focused towards Samsung (you know the company that makes the screen, processor, RAM, and ROM in most Apple devices). Compared to a more vanilla Android experience, Apple blows. My $200 Zenfone 2 is better than any fruity phone at a third of the cost. With Apple, you pay more for less, but get a pointless logo. 07/10/2015 Scott Reply What about Apples different charger cords? Droids micro USB cords work with any other Android device. In fact, pretty much all phones but apple use it. They want you to need to buy new chargers more often. Apples are streamlined fads also, just like every product they’ve ever released. Yeah, cause being “cool” means getting the same more expensive products all the other rich kids got. 07/30/2015 Helene Reply I had both and I don’t agree with this article. I prefer Android phones over Iphones. I think Apple have better computers, but not better cell phones. 03/06/2016 Firas Bajjar Reply Keep dreaming…. 03/06/2016 Firas Reply Keep dreaming….Apple has better computers you serious? You can do a lot of stuff on Windows pcs while Mac struggles to do one stuff….At least it’s stable and easy to use through…But seriously it’s overpriced shit…You can get almost awesome gaming laptops for the price of a MacBook Air. In fact, iPhone is better than android….Because the mobile era is another thing, it’s called mobile for a reason. It should be easy to use and quick. That’s why Apple wins at this point…Come on get real men you wanna play GTA V on your mobile? No for sure. Apps are even better (which surprises me why it isn’t the same for a Mac vs Windows) iPhone’s are faster than most android phones….But if you compare it to stock original android phones, the iPhone still beats them but not as much as other android phones. Because unfourtantely Google didn’t know how to configure Linux properly but i bet you if it does…The iOS faster than android is a history….Linux is ultra-powerful and that’s why most of the world super computers use it…Because you can tweak it the way you like and you will get an extremely faster performance than Windows and Mac. But Google couldn’t handle it I guess….Even the Java language is much faster in terms of processing but I’m still surpsised why iOS apps are still faster….It’s just another replica of Nokia’s fault with Symbian (Nokia never built a stable Eco system for it until it’s near to death period, which led the CEO to get rid of Symbian because it takes years to built an eco system) 05/19/2016 PABLO Reply Right off the bat i can tell you are a little kid who just bought a samsung and is butt hurt you made the wrong choice, “struggles to do one stuff” he also pays great attention in class shown by how grammatically correct this is (as i was writing this I found this… “The iOS faster than android is a history” WHO TEACHES THIS KID I NEED TO COMPLAIN)! 08/04/2015 Robin Reply Poorly written article bringing in irrelevant points and downright false information. Take your “works great with all your devices” section for an example. I use an android phone and an apple computer, and the two devices are 100% compatible with no need for a “third-party application” or service. Completely untrue information in this section. Also I have texts and all the regular online messaging apps I use from both devices well synced. All data, photos, contacts, music, etc from my phone are stored in a cloud service and attainable through my mac computer and my (android) phone. Also your first section “iPhone Apps Are First and Better Looking” contradicts itself. 07/06/2016 Gretchen Alexander Reply My iPhones have NEVER worked great with my PC laptop. NEVER. And the people in the store aren’t much help either. I’ve wasted hours in there. So I don’t know who the person who wrote this article talked to, but my experience has been awful with compatibility between iPhone and PC. In fact, it’s the main reason I’ll never buy another iPhone. 08/10/2015 Malin Saming Reply Really? Here are 10 reasons you have apples for brains: Android is free, Google drive storage is FREE. 15 gig of files, unlimited photos! Androids voice recognition is WAY better, try a comparison, Siri is like a nagging wife who can’t get it right. Android phones have wireless charging! Android phones built in payment that works everywhere. Not at 3% of stores like Apple payment. Android phone MULTITASK, thats right you can run a dozen apps at the same time while talking. Android phones have sizable widgets, so you have live streaming info on your home screen. Android phones are available in endless formats, not like the communist way “everyone has the same”. Android phones PLAY ALL FILES, iphones only play Mp3’s from itunes etc etc pain in the Apple. Android phones have rapid charging, 10 min = 4 hours of use. Android phones are available with 2 days of battery. I could go on and on but your Apple brain will not listen anyways. You probably have a really nice typewriter that you show off the lack of it needing toner or electricity. There is a reason Android is about 82% of the market and Apple has fallen from 33 to about 12%… In fact the remaining iphone users I know all run Google everything on their iphone anyways, why not get the best hardware too. I look at everything I can and see things for how they are, then I buy the best I can find, if you do the same you will love your new Galaxy S6 8^ ) 12/13/2015 Pedro Coimbra Reply I tried, but stop reading after the «iphones only play Mp3’s from itunes etc etc pain in the Apple.» Just this BS of a sentence already has 2 lies in it.

And childish comparison . 09/16/2015 Srikanth Reply I can say something here because I own and use both iPhone 6 Plus and a Samusng Galaxy S6 edge equally everyday. So I think I am in a position to give a fair judgement …or at least decide what works better for me. I have changed over from iPhone as my default device to S6 edge and back to iPhone few times. But I find myself using iPhone 6 Plus more often than S6 Edge…because of these reasons 1. Smartphone is smart because of quality apps. I always found iOS apps looking neater, working smoother and more consistent compared to Android Apps. Just to quote an example…Adobe acrobat reader which i made default app to open PDF files….is not able to open files since last two days all of a sudden and reporting error. Everything is updated but still doesn’t work somehow. But works fine with iOS. 2. Screen of iPhone is marginally inferior to my S6 edge which is stunning. But I don’t hold them near my nose and try noticing pixels. From a practical point of view iPhone screen is absolutely fine. 3. In spite of inferior hardware specs on paper, I can’t deny iPhone user interface is more fluid and smooth. Thats what makes the experience more pleasant for me. 4. iPhone 6s is already launched…I am not upgrading. But know what? Last night iOS9 update was available to my phone. I have already updated to same. Isn’t that amazing? I can’t help comparing my Galaxy note 4, my near stock android Motorola droid turbo.. etc..which haven’t received even 5.1.1 Lollipop when Android Marshmallow is about to be launched in a month. Sad. This alone is enough for me to stick to iPhone as my default device. 5. I havent noticed parallels for some Apps in Android (Drafts, Soulver etc). Which I learnt to use often and liked. I am a fan of some automation apps like Tasker on android which doesnt have an iOS equivalent. But as of now my use of same is less. 6. I guess iOS is bit more secure compared to android against virus attacks and hacking. it IS something important to me in this era of mobile banking and when we keep so much data on Google drive and One Note etc. and hey…Google has made most of its apps available to iOS. I agree my S6 edge is superior in Camera department and pictures look very good. Also usage of widgets is better in android. But after using both OS since last 3-4 years, I am sticking with iPhone as my default and S6 edge for miscellany and photos. This is what works for me. I know others have other reasons to stick to any one OS. I have best of both worlds now but can’t help saying one is better than other at present. 12/02/2015 Zombieknight Productions Reply Updates are an invalid point, because the newest version of iOS isn’t as good as a 2 three year old version of Android 12/02/2015 Srikantha Krishna Reply I don’t agree with you there. Updates are important. They optimise the software, remove bugs and important to plug security issues. Of course Google releases them but only nexus customers get it. Other manufacturers don’t release it in time. Tell me now how many handsets are going to get Marshmallow and when???? 04/25/2016 Sally Fallis Reply So which is less complicated for the over-50 me who is good with words but not pictures? I had to ask a young person what all those little dots and waves, etc., meant on my Ipod Touch. I really miss words, but I realize I am alone in that. Is a Samsung any easier to navigate for (duhhh…) me? 07/11/2016 Iggy Z Reply If you are over 50 you should definitely stick with Apple 1. it is extremely easy to use 2. you can do many tasks without even doing anything, but simply telling your phone to wake you up at 5am, or to remind you to take your pills when you get home 3. you can change the text size and icon size to accommodate your eye-sight 4. you can ask any teenager to help you organize the icons into more intuitive way Microsoft Windows phones are rich on words, but while it would satisfy your need for everything being written – the phone will be difficult to use, and will still contain many icons. So, go with Apple, even an older 16GB model, will still be fully supported, and will work perfectly well, do not get 64GB version, you wont need all that memory. 07/16/2016 quenchybro Reply but apple is expensive 08/25/2016 ermm Reply with android it is much easier to use… you can tell your phone to set and alarm….you can change the text size 01/10/2017 Frank McConnell Android is an absurd ecosystem, the UI is very hard to even remember, iOS is better due to the simplicity of the UI. OP was right about iPhones being easy, I use one because android is hard to use. Maybe you should get an iPhone, it’s 5x faster than every android phone in the world and you’ll get a good one on eBay for like $200! Why do you think Google is better on iOS than on android. lel, Android is a joke OS and should be defunct! 10/15/2015 Andras Reply I´ve been an iPhone user for 2 years, recently I bought an Android phone to verify if really Android is superior… After 2 months of testing it, I sell the Android and bought an iPhone 6… This do not prove that iPhone is better, but for my needs, iPhone is totally superior… Android is good, everything is cheap but is not an stable OS… Yes you can have all personalize, but for what? I´m not a teenager anymore so whats the point to have all personalized and change it every week? By the way the output of the sound of the iPhone is really more superior than the output of any Android phone With an iPhone (in music business) is way better you can control lights, console really simple with iPhone and all tech for music is much more easy to sync and to handled on an iPhone… Music business in a MAC is much much easier I love iPhone and I would not change it anymore Like I said I´m not saying iPhone is better for everyone but for my needs yes it is 12/02/2015 Zombieknight Productions Reply Wow! You’re actually dumber than every other I sheep here. IPhone has good sound? Better than any Android? Hahahahahahaha! Have you even seen an HTC One phone? Best speakers and any phone! Ever. IPhone speaker is tinny garbage. The S6 even has the same placement, but sounds much better. Seriously, Google HTC One m8 or m9. Cm8 literally got the top phone of 2014, and everyone mention how good the speakers work. I also got first place cuz it was vastly superior to any iPhone. Better software, better design, better screen, etc 12/02/2015 Zombieknight Productions Reply And please specify what Android phone it was.

Only a few Androids that have nice customized audio processing(like the LG V20) and no iPhones or Windows phones. Many of the rest of Androids can use this superior sound mod. I have a Nexus 6P with Pure Nexus and ElementalX kernel, which has nice front firing speakers, better than iPhones. V4A gives audio processing to match. Not available on iPhones or Windows Phones. 10/17/2015 Tushar Reply Why r u only talking about iphone 6plus,which is much costlier than androide same feature phones, there are some other iphones had launched by apple like iPhone5, 5s,5c i compare this phones whith 20000 rs android phones where battery of iphones so worst and camera and no memory slot, nevertheless this iphones have more cost than android phones. 10/19/2015 Lu Reply LOL you will not get confused using a LIGHTNING cable? are you kidding me????????? Does this mean that it is designed for dumb people who constantly flip the usb port? is this the main reason! why apple cant for some reason jussssssssssssssssst go with the flowwwwwwwwwwwwwww and use a normal USB port that makes it easier for all humans in the world to share chargers? Dude, i use both systems and i can point out one thing better that most people usually ignore, my Father is blind, he uses an iPhone because tbh the Voice-over mode for iPhone is the best ive seen and used so far.

Its like we intentionally left out carrier costs, the limited gb storage that iphones have And dont even get me started on “no company bundled apps”. Do you know how much tracking, data mining even occurs with an iphone? Fingerprint bypass? Are u srs? The iphone is for the general public who doesnt know any better just following ignorantly what is popular culture.

All the successful people I know use an iPhone. The only credible alternative in business to an iPhone would be a BlackBerry running BB10. Android devices are for the unemployed and vagrants. Thankfully I don’t know anyone with an Android phone. I don’t want to either! Please only contact me if you use an iPhone and have a job / home. I don’t want be associated with anyone that uses an Android. It would make me look bad.

You only choose an Iphone because every one else has an Iphone, if not you would of picked android and said Iphones suck, you also don’t even know how technology works bitch, so I would not be talking because there are far more android devices with better specs, and fyi i’m a kid obviously i’m not employed. 04/22/2016 Derp Reply Well then maybe you didnt know what a high end android phone is.. Poor you. 05/21/2016 Cowbladder Reply This post is what makes you look bad. 05/21/2016 Cowbladder Reply Also, aside from your arrogance making you look bad, you have got to be kidding about BlackBerry. I carried the Z10 now carry the Passport with BB10. I only have it because my company prefers BB’s security. But as far as fuctionality, it’s like working with bear skins and stone knives compared to iPhone or Android. The lack of apps and limited integration with other devices is stifling. That’s why I carry a separate personal phone. It’s also why BB is abandoning BB10 and switching to an Android platform. So are you going to cast off your somewhat acceptable friends who carry BlackBerry when their platform becomes Android? They better run out and get an iPhone when that happens so they can still be honored to be deemed worthy of your friendship. 07/11/2016 Iggy Z Reply 1. Android they switch to is FULLY custom and has all google services BLOCKED 2. This is the reason why companies are abandoning BlackBerry due to high maintenance costs and instead make private applications for iPhones which you can only download using a special code, a secure application within a secure platform, cheaper to maintain, more convenient for an employee to use. I completely agree with Bob, Androids are for 12 year olds and vagrants, the paper specs of Androids (factually and historically) are not an indicator of how they perform. And the fact that you think that you are smarter than a mass of hard working high ranking professionals, and that you need to show them all how “individual” you are by always “personalizing” your phone – just shows you are a fool and have nothing to do but to play with yourself on your phone like a kid, I bet you are one of those people who thinks wearing a watch is stupid and unmanly because you have a clock on your phone. 07/16/2016 quenchybro Reply ur insulting me cos im twelve so dont try piggy 01/30/2017 Selenia Reply You guys keep proving how Apple markets to ignorant people with a credit card. Reason many companies don’t use Android is because of the differences in OS customization from device to device and manufacturer to manufacturer. That can be a nightmare for testing in house apps. Nothing to do with security. My company uses Android tablets, but all the same kind. Only point you are right about is specs don’t reflect performance. Nexus/Pixel devices have good specs, not the best, but just try finding a faster Android or iPhone, for that matter. Why? Stock Android that hasn’t been bastardized. 01/17/2016 Grace Reply I use an iPhone, but custom built my own PC. I don’t like Android phones (had a Samsung galaxy for a year before switching back) but I also don’t like Apple computers. Honestly? What people buy is a matter of taste.

LOSER! 03/23/2016 sheel r shah Reply This article is so immature and stupid. Seriously, apps look better? You couldn’t even come up with a better reason?? I can literally break this article point by point. I would just like to say one thing though as a rebuttal, A NEXUS too receives the ota updates. An iPhone 64gb on contract costs almost the same as a carrier free nexus. I am a galaxy s7 user and the screen quality is maybe 2 generations over the iphone. As for the notifications, I prefer android’s iteration way more than apples. And about the cables, except the s7, all flagships use USB type c Samsung compensates with wireless charging. The battery life on a nexus or an s7 edge is way superior than the iPhone. And hangout video quality is as good as facetious. Also I like the fact that you don’t need to get out of hangouts to make a video call. In iphone you can usee iMessage but then to make a video call you need to get out and go to facetime. I get to play with manual controls on my camera which iphone doesn’t permit. I can literally go all day long about this. Just one actual good point about iphone you could have mentioned instead of the trash is that it has a stronger graphic processor that but by a small margin. 03/23/2016 sheel r shah Reply One more thing. You mentioned sharing. Do you feel ashamed that you cannot share media via Bluetooth?? The most basic mode of sharing? Talking about airdrop please use wifi direct once. Or nfc sharing. 03/28/2016 Stanata Reply Basically what this article is saying is: “use iPhone instead of Android – it’s more easy to use if you’re an idiot!”… lol There isn’t even one reason of those in the article that is 100% true… and almost all of them are complete crap! I mean come on – even monkey can plug MicroUSB and it is “a must” standard in Europa for instance anyway. Let alone that the future is in the wireless charging… And who today is NOT using Viber or WhatsApp? Who needs another messenger? I can continue, but don’t see point in that – the articles like this is obviously paid one. But sooner or later it will be clear at the end – the open environment will always be above the close one, because it is more close to the people!

It’s a Huawei, nice BIG screen I guess they call a Phablet. My younger son has an iPhone 6 plus. I decided to try an iPhone 5s just to see what it’s like. I have 30 days to check it out. So far, the ONLY thing see is the slow motion camera that’s cool and maybe some cuter emogies …I think they’re called. Otherwise….. I’m so far not impressed. My Huawei Android is 16g the iPhone 5s is 16g. The Huawei was I think $200 and the 5s $160 with its VERY tiny screen. My son has a 6 plus and 64g and that would cost me $650 or maybe it’s $650 for the6 plus 16g. Anyway…. Lots MORE MONEY. I guess if you have a lot of music… It’s better but I just have Lots of pictures. I like my sd card for these. I don’t know all the techy stuff and I don’t do Twitter or FaceTime or sharing pics except Facebook and text. I thought maybe some apps would be cooler but so far… I’m not impressed with the iPhone at all. Just my opinion. 04/12/2016 D Dawg Reply smoke weed everyday 07/16/2016 quenchybro Reply wtf!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 04/19/2016 J Corn Reply I knew this article was a joke when his very first reason is “Snapchat looks prettier on iPhone”.

The iOS Is custom built for and iPhone but the android softwares are not built for any particular device or hardware so optimisation is nog as good as in an Apple device. It not about specs the camera which shas more megapixels cannot alone deliver better pictures , a processor with more cores and greater clock speed can not alone give better performence until it utilises the most of it. So as Apple builds it products to its own requirements and deliver better products than android phones. An iPhone has better quality of internals as well as the body and feels premium than its competitors so that’s why an iPhone is an iPhone. 04/26/2016 De'Zsa Smith Reply Currently on my iPhone 6s+, sobbing as I type this. I’ve just got through longingly browsing Google’s Playstore, seeing all the recent updates of my favorite apps and hidden gems that the Apple Store just cannot compete with. Android has some seriously dedicated developers, and I’ve always admired them and even began looking into Android app development. That is… Until I switched over to iPhone several months ago after being a dedicated Android user. I will always be Team Android, hands down. I had a rooted Nexus 5, which means I’m all about customizability, design, testing, flexibility, and freedom. Then I decided I wanted to try something new—FaceTime, great camera, updated social apps like snapchat…you know, the basics. Biggest. Mistake. Ever. Switching over to Apple feels like I’m using a flip phone. Now I’m trying to decide if I should just switch back, or keep this iPhone as a means of communication (don’t know if I’m willing to give up FaceTime with family and friends) and have an Android for all the things I miss. 04/27/2016 weez Reply I just giggle at these articles. Ok Iphone kids, my phone has a webhost, tftp server, a windows deploy share with every iteration of windows going back to w2000, an SMB client, FTP client and host, Tftp server, wi-fi signal scanner, packet sniffer(nmap), a high frequency oscilloscope, a bluetooth HID remote that controls anything bluetooth, a linux/android debugger, point of sale and inventory tracking software(apple has it too but not complete on the phone), and at will I can change my MAC and spoof other phone’s IDs. My phone is a half decade old S2. So I guess if you plan on propping up a desk buy an Iphone, for everyone else that has work to do either grab a toolkit full of different things or just grab your android phone. 04/28/2016 Ken McDowell (@morpheusxp) Reply I don’t understand why it is all Android users say that iPhone users are sheep and that they use an iPhone because everyone else uses an iPhone. The iPhone has less than 20% market share world wide. That means less than 1 in 5 smartphone users have an iPhone. It seems to me going with the herd is more of an Android thing than an iOS thing. Just saying… 05/21/2016 Cowbladder Reply I think it is more because a lot of iPhone users seem cultic. I honestly think iPhone is a high quality product. But I really like high end Androids as well. However, I know people who use only Apple products and make little comments here and there about how inferior ALL Androids are. In that way I think they are like sheep because they have bought into this notion that their are no good Androids and they are operating on a higher plan than non-iPhone users. 05/23/2016 Anthony Reply Agreed. Probably because in the beginning people lined up outside of stores to get the latest and greatest iphone. It’s great hardware, but I can’t get used to a single button. Plus iphones seem to have a higher resale value. I don’t know. I do like how apple updates their devices in a timely manner and no bloatware, etc. I think Android is getting there, but unless it’s a nexus, updates are all over the place. I want the screen of a Samsung, build of an HTC with the battery life of my droid turbo, a headphone jack at the bottom of the phone instead of the top and I would be in heaven. Plus everyone I know say is that a Galaxy? So people in my area associate anything android as a Galaxy. Great marketing by Sammy, but perception becomes reality sometimes. 05/21/2016 Cowbladder Reply Meant to say plane, not plan. ☺ 01/30/2017 Selenia Reply Yup, it is about the Apple cult and the attitude that you are unwashed and not worthy if you use an Android. The attitude you must be broke, homeless, etc. My Android costs as much as a lower range current iPhone and can do way more. Here in the US, they have much greater market share, unfortunately. 04/28/2016 Joe Reply iphone has nothing on android. They have a good camera but that is about it. isheep all butthurt because android is taking over the world. 04/30/2016 qwertypop13 Reply So far all my favourite android apps were not available on ios, plus a lot of apps are a minimum of 10 cent cheaper on gpl than on apple app store. I also find it totally ridiculous that iphones need to be jailbroken to undergo any form of customization. Plus who wants fast updates at the expense of severe bugs, them slowing down stuff even more and getting a crappy operating system that hasnt changed since 5 years. Iphones are for people that only use their phones to txt and make calls. ps. I have a $20 alcatel phone and wouldnt ever trade it for an iphone. Buy what you like, but the points on this website are the worst I have ever seen. As far as I know you cant even use iphones to transfer files other than audio and photos to and from macs/pc’s. Apple phones are overpriced by like $500 dollars just because they have a flashy logo which they stole from the beatles. 05/05/2016 anthony Reply I love my android devices. Have I had problems. Yes. More than my wife’s iphone? Definitely. But I tinker with it a lot more than her iphone. I transfer files back and forth from a computer a lot easier with my device. Yes using third party apps but it’s still easier. I have all my music in google play, but use itunes (whole family uses ipods) so I just sync up that to google music and playlists as well. Each device has it’s pros and cons. I have used a rooted tablet to get pure android (didn’t like it) and have an ipad 2 which I love. It’s about choice and I like that we have it. Two points I agree with the author about: Timely updates and bloatware. HTC is bucking the trend to stay afloat by addressing this. Wireless charging is not worth it yet. I much prefer quick charging and new devices starting to roll out with usb-c. 05/07/2016 C Reply The article and ensuing comments are a joke. This is what The internet has come to now days. Let me be clear, I have years and years of experience with Android, IOS, Windows & Linux. I have every certification and more hours logged on to these then most of you. Now that we have established my far superior ability to actually comment here goes. First of all, the people on this blog and on others like it simply cannot help the fact that more people love iphone than android, period. So they make nasty little comments because they are frustrated that in reality they couldnt influence people in high school and they aren’t able to now. Second the android users who get angry at Apple users simply appear to only be mad because they don’t have an iphone them selves. Guys! Really! Let me be clear I have Windows and android and iOS. Iphone for the nomal every day user is PERFECT! Let them be! The android is perfect for more shady people who want to be power users an anarchists or some how feel like they are breaking the law or the rules. That is how android feels and that’s the base line of the os. I currently have an android because I can be one of those more shady people who like to go against the grain. But I don’t like android. Who the he’ll wants to root a phone? Who wants to spend hours on doing something? Not I! It takes me 10 minutes to jail break an Apple as and BAM I’m a super users with a linux based system and am sitting with a very powerful device! They all being said I have an android bc of expandable memory, an IR blaster, and a few other small features. When Apple steps up the game with these I will switch to Apple. Here is one reason why. What is a smart device? It is an item created to make your life as a human eaiser. Apple does that by leaps and bounds! The phone thinks of you like a loyal old dog and wants to do nothing more than serve your every whim. I can tell you the iphone holds up better, know why? Ever had to fix your mom or dads PC? And you think to your self wth are they doing with this thing. We never hear that issue out of iphone. So really is a beast just for that reason alone simply bc the general population can break them by doing stupid stuff. Now on to adress some other stupid comments for people who pretend they are SO smart. Windows is better than a Mac ios! Hum WRONG! Know why? Windows is a dos based crap system with a gui created for the average consumer to use a device. It’s not a damn computer it’s a pretty device to help you numb skulls use paint and word or get on the internet. What is my point now!! Oh yet MAC IOS is FAR superior at least for anyone who actually knows how to use Linux which by the way was and still is the base os on which all other smart software was and still is created. So you pretty little Windows fanboy users, please get a grip because until you stop drooling over your poster size photo of Bill gates and actually learn Linux you know nothing about computing. The really dumb person who commented about Honda’s vs Chevys! Hahaha seriously though? You also probably know nothing right? Honda and GM use the exact same part manufactures which in turn makes both cars CRAP! Research before you comment. Go get what ever phone you want and fanboys of each need to get a grip! 05/29/2016 C Reply Just to clarify a few things for the “people who pretend they re SO smart” Windows has been detached from DOS since windows 2000, It maintains compatibility by running an DOS virtual machine on the NT Kernel. Not all systems are based on Linux, Linux is based on Unix, Mac OS (and IOS) is largely based on BSD which is a variant of UNIX, The Windows Micro-kernel is also partly based on UNIX. For someone who has “years and years of experience with Android, IOS, Windows & Linux.” and “every certification and more hours logged on to these then most of you” you are spreading a lot of misinformation. I personally own all apple products, but have and still use the other platforms, They all have their advantages and downfalls. And although I use a Mac, Ipad and Iphone predominantly I still have moments of frustration when I miss windows, android and linux for one reason or another. 05/29/2016 CC Reply Not the same “C” as above btw 05/18/2016 Nikhil Bansal Reply Great Information.

Also, how can you say apple doesn’t come with bloatware? Have you tried removing the stocks app recently? What about file sharing, have you never heard of Android Beam? Or the fact almost every flagship has a fingerprint scanner now? This is the most poorly written, one sided piece of crap I’ve seen in a long time. How do you even have a job? P.s. I own a Nexus 6p for private use and iPhone 6s Plus for work and they’re pretty much equal in every way except for the Nexus having a better screen, free apps, faster charging and longer battery life. 07/16/2016 quenchybro Reply +1 lol 06/03/2016 alpharidley9098 Reply This article made me laugh pretty hard. I just love the reasons they give for the phone being better. Now 1 thing that is always MORE important than ALL of these is the actual phone. Also, those apps that come with the phone, it depends on what you are getting… Also, you do know apple is making a switch to MicroUSB right? Humph. Seems like just in this 1 paragraph I have already made better points than this article. Anyways, phone-wise, androids are almost always more powerful than an apple phone because of the fact that iPhones are never equip with a good core or a good amount of RAM. They slow down quite quickly and seem obsolete after a few months. Yes. Months. I have had my Moto G3 for awhile and it is still ultra fast and has no technical issues. 06/03/2016 Jens Lipponer Reply problem with iphones is that u need itunes etc.. and too many permissions. I like to just plug in and drag and drop files…. I don’t give a monkey’s behind whether apps look better or what not. let’s be honest, price wise the iphone is beaten every time. there is just no bang for buck. I laugh at people who buy these things for the show off appeal as I know they are getting ripped in a rather large way……… 06/08/2016 Mohamed Faizul Reply I used android for 7 years this is my first iphone 5s bought two years back From the day i bought this iphone till now regularly i m browsing in website that why iphone is better than android, why iphone is better than android,why iphone is better than android,why iphone is better than android but while using android i m much okay with everything…. iPhone is simple best for call ,messaging ,camera with instant speed though its two year old device … But not more than that In android its like sea u can do lot lot more than iphone but not as quality standard reliability fast easy as iphone . 06/09/2016 Ryan Reply Has anyone thought that maybe iPhone is more simple than Android simply because the staff aren’t smart enough to produce anything more complicated than simple? It seems obvious to me. At least Android screens don’t break when you drop the phone on carpet like iPhone’s do. There’s Applecare because the iPhones break like a window hit by a baseball because the whole phone is either thin aluminum or covered in glass (which is a hazard if the glass shards cut you and potentially make you bleed out). The aluminum iPhone’s are currently being made of bend in your pocket! They’ll need some high quality flexible glass and easily bent straight CPU (without anything on the inside being destroyed). By the way, for the vibration thing on Android you don’t have to input password or anything just click the power button and hold down the turn down volume button for a second or two and that’s it. 06/10/2016 Shaggy C Reply So your reasoning is half “It’s popular” and most the other half is comparing apple features to the bad features of a multitude of android phones?

So we may conclude lots of ……… 07/03/2016 Charlie Drac Reply I’m so late to this party, but I HAVE to comment.. I do not care what the name brand is. It could be called Android or robot or Apple or peaches or dog poo. All I care about is having a good phone that can do the most. Phones are expensive. I’m not buying a brand name. I’m looking to buy something that has everything it could possibly have if I’m going to spend that kind of money. You’re “reasons” show good things about IPhone, but are not “reasons” as to why it’s better. IPhones are good phones. People like IPhones because it’s a trend. It’s popular. That’s it. IPhones are not even close to androids. Be truthful. Androids are mini-computers. Literally. IPhone is not. You can do 100 more things with Android that you cannot do with IPhone. The That is the truth. And Apple products are a lot more expensive. Why would anyone pay more for a phone that gives you less? It boggles my mind. Android has variety. There are many, many phones, companies, styles to choose from. They even offer cheaper options that get the job done. They have an SD card slot. Why would anyone dish out $100’s more for more storage? That SD card is yours forever. For future phones or other devices. You can plug your phone into your computer and save(on the phone or SD card) anything (music, photo’s, video’s, contacts) and it’s yours. Without having to go through ITunes or anything else. Apple doesn’t own my stuff. I own it. And I can customize anything I own. There are IPhone stores for these little nick knacks. Transferring files, contacts, etc. It’s like going to a car dealership. One side has a variety of great cars. The other side has one car that is the most expensive. You see that all the other cars have a ton of features, options, colors to choose from, engines, horse power, cylinders, 2-door, 4-door, SUV’s etc. You ask “what’s so great about this lonely more expensive car tht only comes in one model and doesn’t have these other options?” The saleman replies with “Because it’s popular”. 07/06/2016 Gretchen Alexander Reply Yes, this! I agree 100%. 07/04/2016 Emanuel Reply No some of these staments are wrong android has a mode that will change you load out to make it simpler and look like apple cameras so much better its not even comparable iphones are rhe same every year android is some thing different like the edge and note you clearly didnt do your research i use to love iphone and thought it was the best and galaxy/android suchs but when i swiched ill never go back to an apple phone 07/05/2016 greentoe Reply http://gtoe.me/l/7A0q-A-04r 07/05/2016 Sam Smith Reply I just smell a whole lot of fanboying and bias. 07/06/2016 Gretchen Alexander Reply I’m astonished at some of the reasons listed why iPhone is supposedly better. I have two iPhones now, a 5 and a 6, that I can’t get my photos off of onto my PC laptop. I’ve gone into the Crapple store more than three times and still haven’t gotten them off. My idea of HELL is the Crapple store! I hate that place. There’s hardly room to stand and then you end up being sat at a table waiting with a bunch of other frustrated people waiting for a tech to help you. Of course this is after you make an appointment, or in my case last time, two appointments. I don’t see that as a plus at all because not only is going there a royal pain in the ass, but then they don’t even offer much help after several hours. My iPhone does not recognize as a drive when I plug it into my PC. It used to, and then stopped. I don’t want to have to use iTunes to transfer photos or music. I want to just plug it in and have it be a drive and copy whatever files I like back and forth. It does not work; and I’ve spent, literally, hours trying to get it to function that way. I also have a pretty complex DSLR camera and yet it is still easy as can be to transfer the photos from the memory card onto the computer. So why can’t a supposedly user-friendly phone just do the same thing? I seriously hate my iPhone 6 so much I wanted to shoot it, except I discovered it’s worth a good bit of money still so I’ll sell it on ebay. 07/09/2016 Joey Reply A lot of childish responses from android fans here. I gave the nexus 6p and try for 2 months after my old iPhone broke. Hardware was great, but I found on this android phone the app integration and interoperability to be no where near as good as an iPhone. Apple is just better when it comes to form and function. Buy an android if you want to tweak it forever and play in a sandbox, buy and iPhone if you need a productive phone. 07/10/2016 Colin Reply Your comment may not be childish but it is not correct. Comparable Android phones have far better form and function. Take the iPhone 6s plus verses a Note 5 or s7 Edge. The Apple is bigger and heavier yet packs has a smaller or same sized screen as the Samsung’s’ yet has far less features. Both these phones are far more productive, can multi-task properly, be fully customized and allow widgets on lock and home screens for speed, convenience and ease of use. The Note even includes a stylus or pencil. Great compact design, fully featured and greater functionality (Android) vs Heavy outdated bloated hardware with mid-range specs and limited functionality (IOS). Not to forget the limited compatibility of iPhones and lack of choice! 07/10/2016 Chris Reply There are facts, then there are opinions. 07/10/2016 Colin Reply This article is a disgrace, misleading at best. Most of the reasons are just not true or highly debatable. 07/12/2016 Benito Paul Reply congratulation all of u commented on weather iphone or android’s is the best In my point of view it may be any phone that is android or iphone. If we had a phone that should meet our requirements.Requirements means each and every people has different requirements in case of security,memory capacity and so and so. Hence apple or iphone buy any thing because all are vanity, “vanity of vanities” 07/14/2016 aileen Reply I’m someone who switched from android to ios but this article is utter bullshit. Yes, I love my iPhone and i’m so glad I switched by my samsung galaxy 4 was nothing but shit lately but these arguments in the article are dumb as hell. Lightning is better than micro usb? excuse me, what? my iphone takes ages to charge (iphone 6) whereas my s4 charged within an hour. i don’t see how that makes micro usb bad. but well my iphone battery lasts over a day and my old phone could have never. sharing location isn’t hard on android since almost everyone uses whatsapp bc imessage doesn’t exist on android and whatsapp has a location sharing option so that argument was dumb. yes, apps do look prettier on ios but i don’t see how only that would be a reason to switch?? this article clearly comes from someone who has only owned apple devices and doesn’t even know what they’re talking about, if you really want to prove a point you need to ask someone who has used BOTH of the things you’re trying to compare otverwise you’re just gonna embarass yourself. just saying. 07/20/2016 KappaPride Reply Why are you guys even arguing about this? 07/24/2016 George Reply The major advantage iOS has over Android is that Apple designs the phone and software. Whereas for Android (open source) other manufacturers have to play with it to get it to work and sometimes it’s not fluid. Take the Nexus phones for example…they just work like the iphones. No bloatware..nothing (like the iphone). Majority of my friends have iPhones and sometimes I wish I did too because of MMS (iMessage). I used both and I hate that i have to use itune for everything but it is what it is I guess. 07/24/2016 Landry Reply I’m 8 years experimented developer for iOs devices and I say that Apple releases so frequent updates because iOs is just a stone age OS to fool iOs users that Apple works seriously behind their products. It must run to compete Android OS. 07/27/2016 Aza Reply Best to have both. I have an Se and G4 best of both worlds 07/30/2016 Bob Reply So many things piss me off in this article but specifically stood out Notifications I have no idea with this author is saying he obviously hasn’t seen an android phone, they are exactly the same. Lightning vs. Micro-USB Micro-USB usually charges everything from headphones, to power banks, and of course cell phones. And multiple times to insert it is an absurd comment, after about a week you’ll probably memorize which way it goes, and how do you insert it incorrectly more than once. And USB type-C is just starting to come to the mainstream that’s why it’s not on everything. Storage Why do people even buy the 128 GB version, not to get apps but to download media like pictures, videos, music, etc. I agree with the statement about how sd cards are treated but there’s a much more simple solution, buy a larger storage option. Sharing purchased content Sign into the play store with the account that originally bought the content, install it, then sign out. Problem solved, and if anyone says “it’s more convenient” think about how often you might actually purchase something that costs actual money, I’ll bet it’s probably less than once a week. And it doesn’t take long to sign in and then back out 08/14/2016 Adso Rossi Reply I love iPhones. They always have nice designs and I like the simple interface. I have been itching to get an SE with its smaller dimensions (I like small phones). Money is not a problem to me but as much as I really want one I will stick with my Android device. Why? Cause the compatibility of iPhones to Windows pcs are real bad or none. You’d say “get a Mac” but I can’t: too many programs I need that unfortunately are only Windows-available. If this one single point of compatibility would be addressed, the iPhone becoming as compatible as Androids, I would get that iPhone SE in a heartbeat! 08/21/2016 nathanlittles plays minecraft Reply Who the hell needs iPhone I can name 100 reasons why Android is better but I’ll just name 20 1. Freedom 2. Apk 3. More sizes 4. More colours 5. Waterproof phones 6. Big and small tablets instead of the HUGE iPad 7. Clear cache option 8. For apps and also all the app store apps 9. No need for jailbreak but if you root you’re device will have no restrictions :D 10. Notification swipe 11. Google now 12. Google maps instead of the crappy apple maps 13. Multiple users feature 14. SD card storage So you don’t run out of storage easily like on the 16 gig iPhones (128GB or even 256GB) 15. Pattern unlock 16. There’s everything on Google play store even GPS spoofers to do the Pokémon go spoof in like 2 seconds 17. Unknown sources option 18. No need for an apple I’d all you need is a Google account which is way easier to set up and use 19. Get apps that are not out in your country easier (Pokémon go) 20. Android sounds better then apple 08/22/2016 Jim Reply This article made me so angry I must go punch a kitten. It’s an interesting psychological phenomenon, our emotional ties to brand loyalty. It’s as if the device we choose to use says something about who we are as people, and there is some ancient war of two types of people being waged through our genetics. Apple users are like Yankee fans, Android users are the goth kid outsiders. And the war rages on. 08/30/2016 Deleau Clément Reply Hi. Please kill yourself.

Like, the notifications. Android is wayyy better. You clear all at once or swipe. It combines like notifications that you can separate. It allows to interact with the notification and app without opening it and its just, way simpler and cleaner. 09/10/2016 Nigel Nderi Reply Let me settle this. Choose an iPhone if you are incompetent or are ok with a company controlling you’re phone completely. Choose an Android if you want to be able to enjoy the latest technologies and can competently manage it’s abilities without whining that it takes more than half a brain cell to use. 09/11/2016 Josh Mcduff Reply Just read all the comments and wow it’s all he said she said. I’ve had my Nexus 6p which btw one poster said it’s Google made nope huewei or whatever. Point is not the same, for about a year now and I’m now getting the iPhone 7. Are the specs pretty damn similar? Yes alot of the same features? Yes update often? Yes Nexus gets all the Android ones first like Apple. Price? Actually the 7 is less than the Nexus by about 150.00 CAD sooo that defeats the argument about price… Just saying. I love my Nexus but I’m open to changing. Ice bounced back and forth alot between Android and iOS can I say one is superior to the other? Absolutely not it all comes down to does it do what I want it to and can I afford it. 09/12/2016 Lee Reply All good and well people love free stuff but free stuff comes with a price of selling your info to the uncontrollable thirst party. iPhone also offer easy printing option than android you have to download something that will ask you to upgrade by paying just to use your printer no way! Also iPhone helps stop third party apps that try to use your phone making phone calls example if you are searching for nearest restaurant Google will show the call number to the same restaurant but when you try to call instead of calling direct the parasite apps like whatsaapp, text… And more they pop up asking you to use them making a call while they can’t function without your service they bug you each time taking away the time you spend trying to make a call. If you’re in a hurry and these app try to suggest you use it think how buggy this is. The same applies to text messages. 09/15/2016 Jada Reply Have u really owned an android?

Apple has had to recall their product so many times because people died from the battery exploding. And with Apple every 3rd phone they stop making updates for it. Android always has updates for their products. Plus Apple owes the government 37 billion dollars Android doesn’t. The iPhone 7 that is coming out is a total ripoff. They copied Samsung. Apple has never made a crack resistance screen and a waterproof phone. Samsung is simply better. 09/17/2016 Rob Doyle Reply I completely am for people having their own opinion, that being said I disagree with the title of this article. That being said without any bias coming into play here, some of the points that the author was trying to make aren’t true or aren’t completely true. 1. “Works with all your devices”… The real title should be works better with all of your APPLE devices. The examples in the article are all apple examples. The author obviously has no experience with android or windows. 2. “Faster Updates”…. Compared to what android device? You can’t just say that Iphones get updates faster and compare that to all android phones. The way that this section was written made it sounds like the day an update is release for Android, nine of there phones get it immediately like the iPhones… this just isn’t true. If you have a nexus you get updates as they are released (just like and iPhone) There is a bunch of other examples that just show the author has no experience with android devices, I’m just going to keep this short. People will choose what they think is best for them. My issue is with the author, not the opinion. All the argument were completely based on opinion and not facts. People are going to read this and take it all as fact, instead of doing research and finding the right device for them. 09/18/2016 Jonathan Masters Reply I have both an iPhone 5 and a Galaxy S7. While there are some advantages to the iPhone, there are several reasons why I just can’t make a permanent switch. First, no home screen widgets (like my calendar and agenda). Sure, you can add something like that to the notifications screen, but that involve swiping, as opposed to right on the home screen. Second, it’s so difficult — even annoying — trying to organize files on the iPhone. On an Android, it operates exactly like a computer should (and our phones really are computers these days), with folders, subfolders, etc., so you can just copy the files to where you want them for later use. You can’t do that on an iPhone, where all of your files go to some mysterious and deep “collection” on the phone. If Apple were to add those two features, then I’d happily switch away from Android. 09/21/2016 de Coulon Thierry Reply I wanted to try an iPhone, so I got an old one. I could simply not install anything because everything on the AppStore has moved to iOS > 7. I could not bring a single file to the phone. All it would do is sync with iTunes on my Mac, but there is nothing to sync because I don’t use this Mac for everyday life. The iPhone I got did not have any smart way to save battery. The iPhone I got could not play any of my music because a) I could not upload it and b) I could not install anything that would play ogg files. The iPhone I got was heavier, thicker and less good looking than my current Sony. So OK it was an old iPhone, but 90% of what I say would be true for the latest iPhone, and at what price! If you live in the Apple world, then an iPhone is probably the logical choice. I live in the Linux world and now I know I’ll never take another look at an iPhone. 09/24/2016 Jim Washko Reply Worldwide stats – Android users 82% vs IOS users 18% There’s not enough votes to even tilt the scale towards IOS being better. Being as the story indicates Android phones are only good for 2 years that makes them more expensive. How can IOS users explain why 82% of the market would rather pay more for less?, if that were in fact true. Iphone offers less control, poor resoluion, no expandable memory and not all phones can share the same apps. Android offers all of it as well as compatible with Windows whcih is currently at 80% of the market share. This is like comparing the Yugo to Prius. Sure the Yugo is cheaper at first, but after a year of so, not so much. Iphone resale is more, but that will drop due to fewer and fewer users as they get tired of the box of crayons with only black and white as an option. when they can get the box of 64 and a sharpener 09/24/2016 Capi Reply Is this all a big joke? You keep saying “iPhone is better than Android” about ten times in the article, like a mantra we have to learn and assimilate, Am I the only one who noticed this? I have and iPad, and iMac and I used iPhone (4, 4s and 5) I am familiar with both iOS and OSX but actually I have an Android and installed Windows 10 on my iMac. OSX is a good system if you like simple and easy interfaces, I don’t really have any problem with it, is a really good system once you learn to do things that are diferent with Windows, like formating drives with Disk Utility. (And if we forget how difficult could be for some people to use drive formats like NTFS in a Mac) But iOS, thats another story, Apple manufactures iPhone and developes a OS which works perfectly with that device, which, supposedly, makes it safer. There ends all iOS and iPhone REAL advantages. There are a lot of reason to say Android is better than Android, but the main reason is that you can freely add and delete files from it. I connect my Android to my computer, I press “Windows key” + “E” and immediately I see all my drives and my Android device there, and I can drag or delete files from it. But when I connect an iPhone I have sync up files with iTunes. Why the hell people think synchronization is good? For example, I spent one week adding all my music from CDs to my iTunes library, then I synced my iPhone and… voilá, my music was there. Then my computer died, and my music adquired during years with my money was completely lost, just because I didn’t buy it to Apple. But hey, music was still on my iphone, but NO, I need a third party program, which costs money or could be a malware, just to upload my songs again to a new computer. (Of course I have all my CDs, but thats a week lost) Im simply asking you to do like me if you can, just try everything, because if I read this article (iPhone is better, iPhone is better, iPhone is better…) I have the feeling that not everyone, but many people conform with iPhone. Just for popularity, for Apple fanaticism, or just because a website is telling you to buy it with superliminal advertising. 09/26/2016 wgallagher142 Reply I actually find that android apps have become much prettier and definitely more modern than iPhone apps at this point.

I have been a heavy android user till date until yesterday when I bought iPhone 7 plus. I own an iPad since two years. I am happy with my iPad which I use mainly for games and some handwriting. Yes I was annoyed from android. I owned s3. It had, due to some reason, a built in issue which I only realized after warranty finished. My faulty s3 obliged me to hate Samsung and android. Then I bought note 4. It solved all my problems I faced on s3. But still there were some things I did not feel good about. Now after purchasing iPhone 7plus 128 GB I understand the power of google. The three apps Google search, google maps and google drive are enough reason to close down iPhone factory from the face of earth. 10/10/2016 BM Reply Thinking to upgrade from s5. Thought for iPhone 7. But it can not do even 5 % work compared to android. My andrioid mobile automatically silents itself when I enter meetings or office. Automatic meeting mode when meeting is scheduled (only beeps) I can give my mobile to anyone to see coz I have app specific fingerprint. Only sensitive apps are protected. All other is open. These are not possible with apple except jailbreak. These are just samples. I can write journal what android can do. Speed is not important with a Ibrick which can not do anything smart. I’m not a fan of apple or Samsung. I want my work to be done and my pocket secretary to work according to my requirements. 10/10/2016 Charles Alden Reply 15 reasons why Android is better. Reason number one, you have an actual file system. Anyone who has dealt with iOS horrendous file management paradigm appreciates the ease as at which files are accessible in Android. You simply click on Open, navigate to where your files are stored, select, done. There is also never any reason to use the Share function except when sharing data with the internet. Number 2, multitasking, iOS’s multitasking absolutely sucks, especially when you compare it to Android. Example, I can stream a film to my TV wirelessly, while compiling an application via a remote terminal, while downloading a 40GB file directly to my NAS drive which is mounted as a local folder, while I convert a media file to .mp4, while I play N64, 007 Goldfinger using a replica N64 USB game controller. I’m able to select my own default apps, so when I download a file and click open, the app that I normally use for that extension opens up automatically. I have a global search function, which is one of the worst things about iOS, how do you find files. That was rhetoric, you can’t, it’s basically hunt and peck. I can customize voice commands, this is perhaps one of the coolest things about about Android. I have around 250 custom voice commands, mostly for searching files. Such as, “show me all file [file extension] created on [date]. Even photos, show me all photos from [city] on [particular date/month, years], even for a particular person , “show me all photos for [name] on [particular date/month, year]” External display support, when am connect my phone to a monitor not only is the resolution fully supported but so is the aspect ratio. Mouse support, while connected to a monitor I can use a mouse and a keyboard. Even when not connected to a phone, having access to a mouse is an absolute must when using a tablet as a laptop. USB peripheral support, so besides mouse support, my phone supports a TB external HD, HP All-In-One printer in which the scanner even works, USB replica game controllers in which a have one for the N64, SNES, Sega and PlayStation. Better overall specs, I have a 2K AMOLED display, 6GB of RAM, USB C, SD Card reader, HDMI out support, etc. I can use a custom desktop LDPI, I changed my LDPI to 380 which is the LDPI that activates tablet mode, which means all of my apps are a lot more powerful than the normal phone UI ones. I can customize my entire system to what I want it to be, give it personality, iOS users have been using the same system UI for the last 9 years. There is absolutely nothing I can’t customize. Inner app communication is a lot better, since iOS has a Walled off prison, or so called Walled Garden, apps communicate via API’s, which is the root of everything wrong within iOS. Anyway as stated above, I don’t have to use some half assed sharing function which creates a copy of the file your sharing every time you use it to open up my files within multiple apps, I simply click on Open. I can even open up the same file within multiple apps at the same time. I never, ever have to create more than one file, I just use the original file, always. I can use Linux under a Chroot, meaning I have a full Debian server running under my phone. Why would you want this, well first of all I have CLI applications like; Python, Perl, PHP, MySQL, Apache, etc. I have all of my favorite Linux GUI applications installed like; Dia, Inkscape, Gimp, BlueFish, etc. I can use my phone as a desktop computer, this one might sound weird but not only is it possible, it works incredibly well. Especially when my phone has 6GB of RAM and a Qualcomm 821. Like I said above I have all of my favorite Linux GUI applications installed in which a bring them up using a xterminal, when I’m at work I have access to about a hundred different Windows applications via a Citrix client which works fantastically. All of my applications including the ndroid ones are opened up in individual windows, so none of that dual app view non-sense. In which in iOS less than 0.5% out of a million plus apps actually support. I have access to widgets, they might not interest you but they are extremely handy. I can use wireless chargers. I can use custom ROMs, even completely different OS’s like Ubuntu Touch, SailFish, etc. I will never, ever not be able to run the latest version of Android. When a manufacturer stops updating their phone, no problem, I just install a custom ROM and they work fantastically. My phone is a computer, a real powerhouse, a real smartphone. Every time I use an iPhone I absolutely hate the experience. I mean even to type a post like this I would have to use a text editor as I would be afraid to loose all of my work as anytime you switch to another app, Safari just resets. It has happened to me numerous times, it’s why sites have started saving drafts, not for the Android users but iOS users. Though what bothers me the most is the lack of multitasking, yes, sure, there are a few apps that can run in the background but they are far and few and none of them are the ones that I need or want to use. Than there is the file system or I should say lack of, dealing with files IOS is simply a complete nightmare. Anytime someone at the office who uses an iPhone gets sassy with me about having an Android phone I simply ask them to show me their user directory, what, you can’t mount it, why not, your phone is so great. Not only do I have my remote server directly mounted as a local directory on my phone but my workstation and all of my cloud services as well, all accessible within any app installed. Again, my phone is also my desktop computer and why not, it’s not only powerful enough but more than capable. I couldn’t believe how horrible the external display support was on my iPad Pro, which I recently replaced with a Lenovo YogaBook, best decision I ever made. Talk about a complete makeover on how I work, I’m actually productive now. I can create detailed reports, all in the background and automatically, I have access to a scripting language, automation, multi-user support with OpenID to access my firms internal network, a real Office suite, MS Office for iOS was a complete joke, there isn’t even a import feature, scripting language, nope, database support, nope, by the way, I have the Android version. Which opens up every app under their own window, iOS’s dual app support on the iPad Pro was a joke, hardly anything supports it and that drag and drop feature, only apps designed by the same developer can use it, so MS Word to MS Excel yes, MS Word to Apple photos, no, useless. Yes, my post is huge, but this authors best 15 reasons why the iPhone is a joke. Almost everything listed I have on either my Yoga Book or new Xiaomi Mi 5s Plus or don’t need it as it’s a waste. In fact 90% of the so called new features in iOS 10 are useless. I held on to my iPad Pro thinking iOS 10 would be a game changer, not only was it not, but there wasn’t a single feature that improved my experience. Apple keeps skipping over every feature that we actually want, need. If your happy with multitasking, file management, the fact that you can’t select your own default apps, lack of customizations, horrible external display support, lack of USB C, limited NFC, horrible USB peripheral support, especially mouse support. Horrible inner app communication including the Sharing function in which took Apple 8 years to even release that crap, ugh, the list just goes on and on and …………. 10/11/2016 Gigi Reply This is one of the most biased articles I have ever read on complementing Apple. I am an adult, I don’t need Apple to limit what I can do with my phone and what I can share and who I can share with. I have used Iphone before and it surely not my cup of tea. 10/12/2016 Emma squire Reply Okay Listen what I think is that you have written an article telling the blank truth of your mind. But you see I have an iPhone 6s,iPod 5,MacBook air, MacBook Pro, Samsung TV with built in smart tv, Samsung galaxy tablet pro and I don’t mind Samsung to be truthful. Also I find that Apple is more easier to use but harder to switch from an iOS device to an LGphone. Emma squire, 11y/o from Aus. 10/14/2016 Babble Reply Let’s face it… I use an android lollipop but after comparing and visualizing the specifications.. One can truly say that iPhone is way more better than android. ..though we need to invest some bucks unlike android phones. 😀 10/14/2016 Huen Reply iOS is superior to Android. I was suckered in buying 2 android devices the samsung galaxy s3 and the nexus 4. I gave it a try because my friends raved about android. They are smart people who generally have great advice and knowledge on technology. So I said I’ll give it a shot because they have good judgement. However I found out that their judgement were out of biased hatred toward apple. Android devices: 1. on paper they have more ram, sometimes quicker cpu clock speed, higher resolution etc. however real life performance tests apple out scores android devices, just check geek bench and speed tests. As for higher resolution our eyes dont even detect the larger resolutions. 2. I found out the hard way, downloaded apps that just didnt work for my device. Google needs to improve this I dont know if they are better now but man they need to detect the hardware your using and tell you ahead of time before you download and install an app that its compatible with your device! 3. customizations my butt!! Its a great idea so called if all your launchers actually look good! haha I tried all these loaders for my s3 and they were all ugly. Just go with apple, its like saying would you hire great designers for your house and you would just let them have their way in designing the house for you or would you want to design it yourself? doesnt make sense look at xiaomi great example they just copy everything apple does and it looks great. Dont hire cheap designers to design the way your phone looks and works. 4. OS – android’s solution to everything is “oh just download this app to make it work or oh just kill this task or reduce brightness or this or that” why?! If I’m paying 1k for a phone why does it not just work? Why must I non stop have to tweak things on my phone to get save battery or make things work? For instance for whatsapp there was no function built into the app that when I want to send a larger video than that of the given limit on a video it just rejects it. On iOS whatsapp gives you a little function that u can just cut the video into segments and send them in separate messages? This sounds like it can be something that is on the app level. I dont know but as for end user experience its just not convenient you need to download another app that will cut videos in segments for you this is retarded. 5. battery life just sucks on android – and my friend is all like well it works for me…well that’s because he had to buy a new battery that was double the size and totally threw out the idea of having a sleek thin phone. Theres on and on the list goes android and samsung devices are not superior devices. The features samsung lovers speak of are just gimmicks. Keyboards, widgets, notifications honestly who cares? Especially when widgets just take down performance on your phone? I just dont see any benefits on android especially the argument went something like this: “oh android phones are cheaper for superior hardware” Like I said hardware maybe superior on PAPER but in real life benchmarks iphones outshine samsung and htc and other top tier android devices. By the way prices are not cheaper anymore so android fanboys have no actual argument. Like I said I tried android and they are not superior phones both hardware and software. Aesthetically Android phones are ugly. You now pay a premium price on sub premium products, and they explode. lol 10/20/2016 Jamezz_ Reply Sure. A Samsung or LG’s phone software is ugly. But stock android?! Android 6.0 stock? It’s an extraordinary interface with origami-style apps. The geometry with the shadows and vibrant colors is beautiful. The app drawer is simple, and you can put the apps you use on your home screen. Android’s advantage is software. iSheep are just too autistic to use it. 10/16/2016 Cmi Reply I have both! I have an iPhone for work and I have an Android for my personal use, in my opinion the phone is shit and could not compare to the Android in any area,i f it were up to me I would NEVER own an iPhone. Anybody who argues this point has never used them side by side. No comparison.anybody who stands in line for the new iPhone is absolutely getting the shaft and not even getting the best product , it’s laughable! 10/18/2016 George Brite Reply Great article. Over the years I’ve had both. Even a couple of Macs. I use PC’s now because I like being able to work on them and build my own. For the average user the I Phone is a better choice. They are simple and work well. Here’s the big negatives for me: The hardware and software are proprietary. In fact the phones are sealed. You can’t install an extended battery. No SD slot. No root access. Comparable Android phones cost a lot less. The Android phones natively work with Google Apps. We use our phones in the business. If I were a casual user it wouldn’t matter if it were a Trac Phone or an I Phone. We use the Google phones and Motorola phones. They run pure Android without all the carrier bloatware. I like to say Apple invented the smartphone, but Google perfected it. It’s like the choice between a toaster oven and a microwave or a full commercial kitchen. Most people will get along fine with the toaster and microwave. They don’t need a commercial kitchen. But, what if you could get the full commercial kitchen for the same price as the toaster and microwave? Everyone has an opinion about which is better. But trust me when I say this isn’t a choice between chocolate and vanilla. There are very distinct differences between the Android and Apple phones. 10/21/2016 ZinicHD Reply Wtf, apps never ever releases on iOS first. It always releases on android first. Also app updates releases on android first, so that’s kind of bullshit what you are saying. The only thing iOS beats android in is security and stability. Also you can get virus scanners on android, so that thing doesn’t matter. And one thing more, who ever uses FaceTime or iMessage, when we have messenger, Skype ect… And that point when you said that iOS stock apps was the stupidest crap I have ever heard. First of all it was a shit point, what are you gonna need the looks for? Second is that not everyone thinks it look better, so keep that mind. I am a iOS user and I am so disappointed that you can’t even customize the most of the things. I have to admit that the design of iOS is pretty nice, but you get quick tired of it. That’s why I jailbreaked my device to get the ability to customize it more professionally. But I don’t compare a android device and a jailbroken device, because jailbreaking is not something that comes with Apple. iOS is also very expensive compared to android devices. And checking storage on android is way more organized than iOS, so I don’t know where you get that idea that checking storage on iOS is better. 10/22/2016 Bent Vanwijnsberghe Reply the lightning port part is bs i have an iphone (looking for a new phone android) and there are around me on my desk already 3 micro usb and 1 lightning port witch costs around 40 bucks for a new one 10/25/2016 Selenia Reply Terrible article by an obvious fanboy. You are listing many things, like lack of carrier or manufacturer bloatware, reversible charging plug, seamless sharing, etc and saying they are exclusive to Apple. Try Googling USB-C, the current standard on any higher range Android, some still cheaper than an iDevice. Try a Nexus, or as of this year, Pixel phone. No bloat, Android as Google intended it. That would be a more fair comparison as those are at least close in the chain to Google, like an iPhone is to Apple. That is, instead of being made by some company who may not even care how it represents Android, build quality, and other important things, instead of pure profit(not say all non Nexus/Pixel phones are bad by any means, but some do give Android a bad name with poor specs and modified/outdated versions of Android). Seamless sharing? Ever hear of WiFi Direct, Bluetooth, or NFC? NFC is the simplest. Just hit share and tap. All but the cheapest Androids have that these days. Anyways, I am convinced you have never used a decent Android, ever. Certainly not one from Google themselves. I will leave you to tend to your iFlock. 10/30/2016 MzJens Reply For android, I think google products like nexus & pixel are much better than samsung. However, I noticed a lot of crappy apps available on google play that doesn’t work. Some apps require root access which only advance users should do. Android interface is not as intuitive as iOS. Some android apps hang. I’ve never had ios apps hang on me 11/10/2016 Pixleboy2 Reply “You have to try multiple attempts before putting the charger in at the right angle” 1. If you do it in a lit environment you will get it in first try because the micro USB shape is easy to see 2. If you are in the dark: And have an official Samsung charger – there will be a “bumps letting you know which way to put it and the only thing that can go wrong is you missing the port, which is possible on iPhone too. And have any old micro USB – there are two, normal, ways to insert it horizontally upside down and horizontally the correct way both 180 degree angles so please don’t exaggerate it. Finally Samsung cares about you that’s why they use micro USB. This may seem weird but basically to legally make a lightning USB cable you need a licence from Apple and Apple only have their own unique charger to earn more profit, that’s why apple chargers are always more expensive, because they are sold by Apple or the retailer needs to make his money back from the licence fare. P.S. Samsung devices come with a 1 year warranty for free and because it’s Samsung you can get cheaper insurance than their one (yes they have one) P.P.S. Sharing has always been easier on android to anything because you could share with a variety of options such as Bluetooth, NFC, messaging app, other third party apps, S share (Samsung own “air drop” that came out in Android version 4.1.3 BI7 – before Ios 7 Also the settings icon is useful, it’s like apple not making the send button on messages 3d touch to send so you don’t accidently press it, sure sometimes you send half written messages but it is more convenient and normal to have it to a single normal touch. And there is a difference between apps looking better and having more features on Apple which are usually hardware based, I just brought this up because no matter who you ask if you compare a Samsung phone with its equivalent iPhone generation, Samsung phones ALWAYS have better displays and MOSTLY have better cameras. Samsung phones are also very comfortable, for example I am writing this on a Samsung galaxy s7 edge There is a setting that allows the micro sd card to be added as side by side storage Finally Samsung has always had earphone controls so either I read it wrong that you said these are things we will miss very much or you are really confused 11/12/2016 Tetsuokenpachi Reply Each and every single of these are false. Android is actually better in every single of these areas. From the first to the last one. Worse yet, many of these points are actually some of the very reasons why idevices absolutely suck. 11/16/2016 Billy Sastard Reply apple is crap, these idiots make their products so expensive, but android is cheaper and has alot of awesome features.android is also WAY more customisable, with out necessarily rooting your device.And if you do, you can do almost anything from installing apps to changing your software. 11/16/2016 Calculadora Gestacional Reply I think both of them are just great! 11/16/2016 Caleb Reply The update can still download on older Apple products, because I have a IPad 2 that came out in 2011 and it still receives all of the latest updates. It is running IOS 10 right now. 11/16/2016 saurabh Reply Been an exclusive apple lover for 7 years now. But just bought an edge 7. Was amazed to see how much progress android has made and makes my iphone look so limited. I am aware that android tends to slow down over time but that is yet to happen to me. For now the openness of android is amazing as it is giving me a computer like experience while iOS still strictly behaves like a mobile device only. Classic hurt points being in iphone /iOS being No expandable memory No dual sim version (i travel internationally and need this frequently) Unable to use lastpass like apps the same way as in android (and keychain is BS, BTW) Simple things like themes unavailable Very less system wide control Very limited customisation I can go on but i think unless my expensive edge can give me same performance as now for ATLEAST 2 years, i’ll eat my words back But, the 15 points mentioned here are almost all very unconvincing. 11/17/2016 Philip Reply Apple are just simple phones no really fancy stuff I have had two Android phone I love their features but not their battery life which is crappie I have had two Apple iPods and two iPhone they were the 4 32 GB & 5s 64 GB now on Android your apps get updated every 3 months on Apple sometimes twice a week IOS updates are twice month at least I bought my iPhone 5s 64 GB which started with iOS 7 in 2014 now it got iOS 10.1.1 it seems the IOS are getting worse not better it freezes crashes most apps lot of the app you can’t even post two year let alone one day old photo I can get on my Samsung Galaxy S3 with 3 year old photos on it and post photos off it to any app only reason I like the small iPhones I can collect lot photos that way I can post to my apps like now I got over 106K photos on my 5s 64 GB which you can’t do with big phones only problems I got with iPhones are updates on apps and IOS’S like this month iOS 10.2 supposedly be coming out it seems the new IOS’s don’t really fixing any problems you get on your iPhone it just give you different problems while you still have the same old problems you also got figure Apple iPhones are about 3 years behind Android phones on new ideals 11/18/2016 Nick Reply Apple!?

From the moment you boot up ios, there are restrictions to what you can do with your phone. Can you flash IOS9 to iphone4s? Guess what, my old galaxy s2 is already running marshmallow like a charm and i think both of them were released in the same year. and i am in the process of flashing Latest nougat 7.1 cyanogenmod version on my s6 edge. You are writing about malware crap which is misleading. New android versions since lollipop allow users to modify app permissions but i think you are so caught up in app constrained ecosystem, you didn’t noticed. IOS isn’t secure anymore as we thought it was. Su vulnerability has already been fixed and there is no more stagefright bug in android. And you obviously have no idea about the difference between android based phones and android phones. Most of the Phones from samsung, htc, sony etc run Custom Android based OS, They are actually custom build port of android, not real android phones, so obviously there will be some issues too if you try to port IOS on samsung. A high end smartphone can go head to head with iphone in each and every aspect. My s6 edge is not even a tad slower than iphone 6, in fact, it performs even better. The slowdown overtime can be experience on low end smartphone. Obviously the one writing this comment has no idea about fstrim. Stop posting such nonsense crap in order to get traffic to your website. 11/25/2016 ashford Reply I have never once had a problem with android phones, but decided to switch it up as IPhones are the ‘in thing’ It was okay for a few months, but soon started having plenty of issues with speed, memory and doing basic things. I decided to upgrade it to the 7, which turned out to be just as bad. For the price, they should be giving people something amazing, not mediocrity! P.S. How much did they apple pay you for such a bad article. 12/03/2016 Brandon McLean Reply You didn’t mention how Apple has a much smaller battery, late software updates, unneeded restrictions, is insanely overpriced, and most of all, Apples processor specs come in at a fraction of what Androids of the same price have, AKA 1.6 GHZ (Apple iPhones) vs 2.4 GHZ (ASUS, Galaxy S7, OnePlus all running Android), 2 GB of RAM (Apple) vs 4 GB of RAM (Android). Android is by far the superior technology. Your only argument is that Android uses Google’s superior sharing system, rather than their own like Apple does. 12/14/2016 Keith Llewellyn Reply For me, it’s all about security, and Apple has the best. Also, if you buy an iPhone you get updates and support for a couple of years more than Google provides for it’s own Nexus or Pixel phones. Two years worth of updates for the OS and Three years for security updates FROM THE DATE OF FIRST INTRODUCTION is totally inadequate. It means that you have to buy a new google phone from the date it is first available in order to really benefit from the updates. 12/27/2016 Apple Marketing Machine Reply Let’s compare the “core” features of a new iphone to a 2 year old android phone: iphone 7 plus – Released 2016, September Samsung Galaxy Note 4 – Released 2014, October iphone 7 plus – 1080 x 1920 pixels (~401 ppi pixel density) Samsung Galaxy Note 4 – 1440 x 2560 pixels (~518 ppi pixel density) iphone 7 plus – Quad-core 2.23 GHz Samsung Galaxy Note 4 – Quad-core 2.7 GHz iphone 7 plus – 12 MP camera Samsung Galaxy Note 4 – 16 MP camera iphone 7 plus – Non-removable Li-Ion 2900 mAh battery Samsung Galaxy Note 4 – Removable Li-Ion 3220 mAh battery okay…you can have your “better looking apps”. 12/28/2016 MACKabiVIPer42 Reply Yes Android phones are better everything wise but iPhone battery is better last as long as up to 3 to 4 years Samsung last up to 6 months I know had S3 and HTC 1 still got S3 3rd battery it’s just iPod on second iPhone first one was iPhone 4 32 GB lasted 4 years got iPhone 5s 64 GB it’s over 2 yrs old but don’t use for taking photos just for collecting photos which small iPhone can collect up too 100K photos like my iPhone 5s I’m not SELFIE PERSON where I got take photo of my self in every window mirror and bathroom I love stealing other people photos like Anime ladies in bikinis to post on my other apps even Animals if they are cute enough yes Apple do make there apps crappie and there IOS’s also which crashes and freezes a lot then half time you can’t post photos or articles from your e-mail too the apps but I take Apple for small phone over android big phone 03/06/2017 iAlex Reply More pixels require more energy and chip performance.

This list is pure “i don’t like it so that means android is bad” and “its apple so whatever it does it’s genius”. if you’ve ever ACTUALLY went from crapple to android (unlike 99% of the comments here that say they have but in reality… well) you would notice a LOT of improvements over crapple. 1: The price to quality ratio is MUCH better that apple’s. 2: More customisation options. Unless you count changing your phone cover as “customizing”. 3: It’s not apple, so it’s better (see what i did there? I did the shit apple fanboy’s do) 4: No dumb “inovations”. 5: Simplifying things and making something that takes 3 seconds isn’t better, Sony, Samsung etc focus on more important things to improve. 03/06/2017 iAlex Reply Well you sound like Forest Gump in his movie when he said that his friend opened Apple company for selling fruits….

But if you’re like majority of people and have a Windows computer that’s a lie. I installed iTunes once and my computer was never the same again.

I have a android galaxy tab 3 and the iPod 6 generation and if I was to choose which is better it’s definitely Apples product and I never would get an android again. When I got my android new at Walmart it couldn’t even get the latest version, it was completely unbelievable. After I had it for 3 months it slowed down on me and its battery life is horrible. Now when I bought this IPod new I’ve had it for a double the time now and it works like new and best of all it can get the latest version. The quality of Apple is way better. In my opinion the iPhone is the best visual quality I’ve seen yet. Ive done some decent gaming on them and if you want something to save your progress then forget android, because not all the game link to your google play account so if you reset it the ones that don’t link are gone. Unlike apple I haven’t had any issues with it. I’ve lost decent money and progress on android because of it. Yes Apple does come out with the newest technology a bit latter then android but you can see it it a good way or a bad. The bad way would be that their slow, the good way you can see it as if their watching googles failing parts and their making it better. 01/03/2017 Marcelino Reply Also I can see you all are fighting over this topic which is pretty stupid. To be honest you can’t necessarily compare them. Everyone is different so everyone is going to want something different. If we all wanted android or we all wanted Apple we would become robots. If you wanted to find a phone to get then get into inside detail to see what your looking for. If you wanted fun texting and want to be more secure then go straight for apple because they got the best for that but if you wanted fun lock screens or be able to put micro SD cards and changeable batteries then go for android but let me remind you that anyone can take the SD card out and take your information. Hope this helps. 01/04/2017 LOREN FOK Reply people will buy iphone just because thats what everyone else has they dont even know what they are buying.

To know about these or making a decision about which is better or not… Please read about these two on this link: http://peaktal.com/iphone-ios-or-android-which-one-is-best-to-buy/ 01/17/2017 Haviette Reply Please, folks, be nice. This isn’t a social networking site.

Is that the best you could do, it gives the article away as biased! Shame 01/29/2017 Ashkar Reply I was a Android addict until I choose iphone for an experiment. Now of course I’m an apple fan. 01/29/2017 THETRUEANDROIDUSER Reply Apple fanboys,crying it out.What a pity,brainwashed fools 01/30/2017 dstrauss Reply I have been an iPhone user since day one (currently 7 Plus), but this article is insanely prejudiced. Most of the alleged superiorities are interoperabilty between iPhones (iMessage, Airdrop) or between iPhone and other Apple devices (Handoff) – if you are a PC owner, or have a large number of friends or fellow users on Android, these advantages are insignificant at best. I will concede that updates and lack of carrier bloatware are significant pluses, the author is doing an extreme disservice to new users by basically promoting an iPhone prejudice. 01/31/2017 Matt Perkins Reply iPhones win over Android smartphones for these 5 critical reasons. Security, Privacy, Stability, Performance and Usability. iOS gets far less malware than Android, it has far less critical vulnerabilities than Android. Vulnerabilities are patched quicker in iOS. iOS crashes and freezes less than Android, Apple doesn’t harvest data to sell like Google does (Google has even started collecting identifiable data since they released their new voice assistant). iOS is a faster OS than Android is while Android smartphones slow down faster than the iPhone does. And of course iOS offers the better out of box experience. Not to mention you can never make Android as secure as iOS, only close to as secure. Part of the reason is even if you tweak your Android settings to be similar to iOS, the official Google Play Store gets far more malware than the AppStore and Cydia combined. So only way to even remotely match it is not download apps or games. My other favorite part of iOS over Android is the fact you can use true adblockers in iOS, not just adblock browsers without the need to root or jailbreak. Google will never allow you to block ads in Chrome or block all ads third party ads without rooting. And as you knowing rooting and jailbreaking merely lowers the security of the OS. That’s another thing Jailbroken iOS is more secure than untouched Android as long as you stick to the default repos in Cydia. 02/01/2017 Shaun Anderson Reply Android Download from unknown sources like a regular computer Download files from browser Plug in and transfer anything to and from computer. File System. Just acts more like a computer in regards to freedom to do as you will where iPhone is locked down like a game system. 03/06/2017 iAlex Reply You can do all that in iTunes. iPhone is more careful to protect data while android is less careful. Today security is most important and that is iOS goal. 02/02/2017 lg k4 ekran koruyucu Reply LG K10 LTE için sergi 1280 X 720 piksel yüksek çözünürlüklü ekran çözünürlüğe sahip IPS LCD yaptı. 02/10/2017 thomasammy749 Reply Stay at home mom Kelly Richards from New York after resigning from her full time job managed to average from $6000-$8000 a month from freelancing at home… This is how she done !!!!!!!!!!!!!http://jobbuzz7.com 02/14/2017 Debadeep Biswas Reply I also believe iPhone is better than Android. I am tired of using Android and going to buy iPhone soon for better camera, speed and style. 02/17/2017 LordyAlmighty Reply One VERY important fact that no one has mentioned… with Apple you can be a total amoral ignoramous and be surrounded by adoring fans !! Who really cares if the poor sods on the other side of the world live the lives of slaves? Who cares if they have to stand ALL day, and ASK for pissbreaks? Who cares if the companies solution to suicides are suicide nets around buildings and removing knives? Who cares if the iphone costs a dollar to make, but sold for $600? Who cares if most of the jobs are not in the countries paying for the status symbols? So lets be clear, its all about “im better than you because i can waste money on bling, and *&$! your community at the same time”. 02/18/2017 exycheezy Reply I’ve had both. many times. I’ve had every version of the iPhone. I’ve never had an Android phone update properly. My 3 year old plays on my old 2nd gen iPhone that has the latest IOS on it. . .. android can’t do that. with the exception of a Verizon flip phone, every single Android phone I’ve ever had got a virus, crashed and I had to reset to factory settings at least 2 times per phone. I have never, ever ever got a virus on ANY Apple product, and never had to put any software or app to keep it running correctly. As far as customization? Who cares. If you’re so busy and have so much time to waste trying to impress everyone with crazy fonts and wild customization, the iPhone is way to sleek, sophisticated and user -friendly for you. Software dictates hardware. The IOS blows Android OS away. And, any (anyone who’s actually worked on both will agree) Apple product gets sometimes twice the speed out of less RAM and processing than ANY other OS (Windows or Android). Give me stability anytime. so your phone has an expandable memory? What good is it when it won’t run half the time. Have a nice day all. . .. .after all, they’re just phones. . .. right? 02/19/2017 Richie Reply Some things to add (pros and cons) as a PC & Android guy that just switched to iPhone (but I’m staying on PC): 1) The iOS versions of Microsoft apps are better than the Android ones and they work great. 2) Article is correct: the iOS versions of apps are generally better than their Android counterparts, in ways you will notice. It’s really kind of a shame for Android – I don’t get why they don’t just match the exact app. 3) Lightning is neat but I found MicroUSB more useful, since it’s used for more devices, i.e. I have a MicroUSB running from my desk to my PC to charge my wireless mouse, and then I would also use it to charge my phone sometimes. 4) Yes I do miss customization heaven with Android, but this iPhone runs like total butter. Android runs WELL but this thing is so zippy and responsive – you wouldn’t believe it until you spent time with one. 5) ALSO customization isn’t as cut-off as it used to be with iOS. Some apps can latch onto some functions in the phone, kinda like installing an extension for your desktop browser. It’s something. Really I just bought an iPhone to “try something new” and I’m really liking it. 02/28/2017 Toby Reply Just do a Quick google search iphone is less reliable than Android, theres your Answer in the studies. End of debate… 03/01/2017 Viking Sheep Reply These comparisons are so lame… Eg: Country X is much better than the rest of the world, because the rest of the world have varying standards, while Country X has only 1 level of corruption. 03/06/2017 iAlex Reply First: great respect to Steve Jobs who dedicated his life to Apple iPhone invention and to make communication better more joyful between people. Also to feel the power and beauty of technology in your hand. How I wished that Isaac Newton or Ainstein or Nikola Tessa or… would see what we have today… Second: iPhone is far more serious for people who want job to be done as fast and simpler way without delays. Android phones are for kids who like customizations and pretty colors and to look like iron man or similar… Third: iPhone is made of better materials. And looks for business high class. Android phones are copying iPhone’s look especially Samsung. Fourth: iPhone technology, the software and hardware gives you exactly what you need. No more no less. Android technologies gives you extra things which are seldom used and are simply extra using more battery and device performance. Fifth: iPhone has a specific style in design. Keeping updating same style to better one making it each time better and better. Sixth: Applications on iPhone are much better with much less defects than Android. At the end, I had various Samsung, Sony, Huawei, Htc and iPhone phones. I choose iPhone. Now I have iPhone 6s+ black limited edition with golden Apple. It’s very nice piece of equipment. at the bottom line, Apollo 11 travelled to the moon using Fortan on its 360 kb computer. Today we are talking of gigs bytes. So I respect both iPhone and Android technologies for their great effort and progress. Competition shall exist to make difference and better.

You can get a phone with the same specifications(Processor, RAM, ROM, Battery) for $120, where it would cost $800 from Apple. You can get phones that are no joke, 5x faster for half the price.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Apr 10, 2017 at 3:00PM At this point, anybody with even a cursory interest in technology stocks has probably heard that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) recently informed graphics specialist Imagination Technologies (NASDAQOTH:IGNMF) that it would no longer need to use its graphics intellectual property in future mobile applications processors. For those unfamiliar with Imagination, it is a small silicon intellectual property vendor that produces graphics and processor core that it licenses to companies that design and build their own chips. Imagination typically receives an up-front licensing fee for its intellectual property coupled with ongoing royalties for each chip containing its intellectual property sold. Image source: Imagination Tech. Imagination has historically depended heavily on Apple for the bulk of its revenue (just over 50% in fiscal year 2016). However, it's worth observing that this figure understates just how important Apple was to Imagination's PowerVR graphics business. Digging into the numbers In fiscal year 2016, Imagination reported that total revenue from what it defines as "continuing operations" came in at 120 million pounds (about $149 million). Of that revenue, 17.1 million pounds (about $21 million) of it came from licensing revenue while 102.7 million pounds (about $128 million) came from royalty revenue. Now, it's also worth noting that Imagination doesn't just sell graphics intellectual property. Several years back, Imagination bought MIPS Technologies in 2012 for $60 million. This acquisition added CPU intellectual properties to Imagination's portfolio, and it has been licensing MIPS processor technology since. According to Imagination's annual report, the company enjoyed 6.44 million pounds ($8 million) in MIPS licensing revenue and 23.47 million pounds (approx. $30 million) in MIPS royalty revenue in its most recent fiscal year. PowerVR licensing was 10.16 million pounds (about $12.62 million) and royalty revenues were 77.7 million pounds (roughly $96.5 million). In Imagination's disclosure vis-a-vis Apple, the former said that in fiscal year 2016, PowerVR licensing and royalties from Apple totaled 60.7 million pounds (about $76 million) in revenue. Apple doesn't license Imagination's MIPS processor cores for its chips; its interest in Imagination's portfolio is solely in its PowerVR portfolio. What this means, then, is that Apple made up nearly 70% of Imagination's PowerVR graphics revenue in the company's prior fiscal year. Without Apple, PowerVR has no future If Imagination can't work out some sort of serious technology/patent licensing arrangement with Apple, then it is extremely unlikely that the former will be able to continue to fund the development of its PowerVR graphics technology. Of course, there's the possibility that Imagination could find new, large customers for its technology, but that's not going to be easy. With Apple out of the picture, that's roughly 15% of the total addressable market in smartphones gone. Furthermore, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is the largest smartphone applications processor vendor, capturing about 42% market share in 2015, per Strategy Analytics (2016 numbers should be a bit different, but you get the gist). Qualcomm builds its own graphics processors and is therefore not a potential customer of Imagination's graphics tech. We're already at half of the mobile applications processor market out of Imagination's reach. Companies like Spreadtrum, MediaTek, Huawei, Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF), and Xiaomi (merchant vendors as well as smartphone companies that build their own mobile processors) could be reasonable targets for Imagination's PowerVR tech, but these companies have been largely using graphics technology from ARM Holdings. It's going to be hard for Imagination to capture share from ARM Holdings going forward for several reasons. The first is that Imagination couldn't beat ARM here even with technology that was arguably much superior; ARM's graphics technology has gotten much better over the years and should only get better with time as ARM has the wherewithal to invest much more in such technologies than Imagination can. Even stripping away the technology argument, Imagination's future -- now that Apple is about to walk out the door -- is now uncertain. ARM's future, on the other hand, is rather certain (and quite bright). On that basis alone, it will be hard for Imagination to keep its existing non-Apple customers, let alone wrest away share from ARM. The point is this: Without Apple, Imagination's PowerVR technology likely has no future in Imagination's hands.   Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Qualcomm.

Jordan Kahn - Apr. 10th 2017 12:30 pm PT @JordanKahn Feature Mac WWDC 2017 macOS View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Now that it looks quite clear Apple isn’t having a Spring event– it introduced new iPads, pre-announced new Mac Pros, and launched its Clips app in recent weeks without one– all eyes are on its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) scheduled for June. There are already quite a few clues about what to expect, and this week we’re taking a look at new features that we’d like to see included in Apple’s next major OS releases. Today, we get things started with macOS… The best 4K & 5K displays for Mac More Siri Siri made its big debut on the Mac at WWDC last year. At the same time Apple launched a Siri SDK to bring app integration on iOS. That was a first step to get Siri up and running on the Mac, so this year we’d expect it to gain some new smarts and possibly some SDK integration for app support on the desktop as well. Throw in the fact that Apple is said to be working on a new standalone Siri speaker to take on the Amazon Echo and Google Home, and we expect Siri will once again be a big focus at WWDC this year. Here’s what we’re hoping for… A “Hey Siri” function like on iOS for a hands-free experience would be an easy place to start, and that could also make a lot of sense in combination with HomeKit support (more on that below). AirPods highlighted the need for an offline mode for Siri— you can’t adjust volume using Siri without an internet connection— and it would likely be even more useful on a Mac where users less often have an internet connection when on the move. iTunes is a mess. iTunes/Apple Music/TV app iTunes is a mess. There’s no way around it. Apple has cleaned it up a lot in recent updates, but the app has also become even more bloated as it’s added Apple Music and related features like Beats 1 and radio. Now, as Apple is about to launch its first original series through Apple Music, there’s never been a better time to rethink its iTunes approach… We’ve suggested before, as have many others, that macOS should get the iOS treatment by separating the App Store and iTunes storefront from content consumption. In other words, Apple Music and Beats 1 needs its own app for Mac. The new TV app, which debuted in the U.S. for iOS and Apple TV last year, is still missing from the Mac too. Apple has a lot going on with Apple Music everyday– like live content on Beats 1, interviews, videos, and more– but it’s currently buried within iTunes and not getting the promotion it deserves. App updates While we’re rethinking content consumption with the iTunes redesign and Apple Music app above, two apps are still missing for a better content experience on macOS: Apple News and Podcasts. The new Apple News app is available in the U.S., Australia and UK so far, and only on available on iOS devices. We can only imagine Apple News for Mac, since a lot of Mac users consume their news from a MacBook or desktop Mac, is in the cards for macOS as the company continues to expand the service to more users. Podcasts has never received a lot of love on any platform from Apple, and it could use work on iOS too, but we’d still like to see a standalone experience for Mac alongside the rethinking of iTunes mentioned above. And we’re holding out hope that Apple will have a renewed interest in podcasting in general, as Eddy Cue earlier this year said Apple is indeed “‘working on new features for podcasts.” Apple introduced its new Photos app on the Mac a couple of years back. It was mostly a welcomed update despite a bit of a learning curve with iCloud Photo Library and a total redesign of the previous iPhoto app it replaced. But now its time to start adding some advanced features that we lost in the new streamlined design, and also some of the more advanced pro features that users lost when Apple retired Aperture shortly after. Better file management and advanced exporting and editing features for pros could help bring back old Aperture users that left for Adobe Lightroom and other apps when Photos launched. It’s also possible Apple could bring a thing or two over from its new Clips app in terms of fun editing features for the masses. Group FaceTime calls is a long overdue feature that is rumored to be in the works for iOS 11, and we certainly wouldn’t be mad if Apple brought it to Mac as well. HomeKit support HomeKit support seems like a natural next step for the Mac. Last year Siri came to the Mac, and Siri is of course a key component of the HomeKit experience, allowing for voice commands for controlling supported accessories. If Siri gains “Hey Siri” functionality for a hands-free experience on the Mac, lack of HomeKit support this year would be a shame. A lot of us are on our Macs at home, or have a Mac in a central location in the house or office. In many cases it might be more useful to talk to your desktop or MacBook instead of a mobile device. It would also be a good way to possibly get more non-iPhone and iPad users into the platform that might have Macs at home or work, and also get them ready to start using that standalone Siri speaker rumored to debut this year. Battery estimates Apple removed its battery estimates from macOS a few months back after it came to the conclusion the “Time remaining” predictions couldn’t keep up with modern processors when switching between low-power and high-performance modes. Instead, now macOS just gives out a remaining percentage of juice left in your battery. Are they gone for good? Or perhaps Apple has had enough time now to come up with a better system for estimating battery life. macOS 10.13? While Apple made the switch from the old OS X name to macOS last year, in order to make the branding lineup with its other operating systems, the version number continued the same as always jumping from 10.11 to 10.12. While we still haven’t had any clues at branding for macOS, a URL spotted last month hinted that Apple would move to 10.13 rather than making the jump to macOS 11 for the next release. Apple will likely continue with its California landmark naming scheme— Sierra last year following El Capitan, Yosemite, and Mavericks from years before— but so far there hasn’t been a hint at names it’s considering for this year. Apple previously trademarked a few options including Redwood, Mammoth, California, Big Sur, and Pacific around the same time it also trademarked Yosemite and other names it has used since. Apple File System (AFPS):  Apple File System or APFS is set to make a debut on Mac this year following a launch on iOS with 10.3 this month, so it’s possible that will have to wait until WWDC. Check out our recent explainer on what will change and improve with the new APFS file system.   These are just a few of the features we’d love to see this year and we’ll be exploring specifics more in-depth soon. Until then, let us know in the comments what you’re hoping for in the next macOS release.

Now, users who were looking for the possibility to downgrade from iOS 10.3 or 10.3.1 will no longer be able to do so. When iOS 10.3 was officially released, Apple introduced its new file system into the upgrade. When users on iOS 10.2.1 upgraded to iOS 10.3, they were seamlessly transitioned to the new APFS. The file system is set to become Apple’s new de-facto system by the end of 2017. Touting multiple benefits over the previous 30-year old file system it replaces, developers on iOS 10.3’s beta knew that downgrading from APFS just wouldn’t be possible. The decision to stop signing an iOS release isn’t out of the ordinary as Apple normally does this a few weeks after a major iOS build is released. With the amount of security holes that iOS 10.3 and 10.3.1 fixes, downgrading to a lower iOS just wouldn’t be advised. iOS 10.3 brought a number of bug fixes and security improvements including Find My AirPods, Apple File System, and CarPlay Updates.

Night Shift and Other Apps That Can Save Your Eyes Mac Productivity Use a Mac at Night? Night Shift and Other Apps That Can Save Your Eyes Tim Brookes April 10, 2017 10-04-2017 7 minutes Use a Mac at Night? Night Shift and Other Apps That Can Save Your Eyes Facebook Twitter Pinterest Stumbleupon Whatsapp Email Apple just dropped the latest macOS Sierra update with relatively few changes apart from one standout feature: Night Shift. It was first added to mobile devices via an iOS 9 update last year. The feature attempts to filter out blue light to make sleeping after working late a less jarring experience. The idea that the blue light emitted from our device screens is interfering with sleep patterns is nothing new. Apps like f.lux have been around for years, so how does Night Shift for Mac stack up? Today we’ll look at how Night Shift compares to f.lux and a few other apps for night owls and dark rooms. Update Your Mac Now Just like Night Shift on iOS, Apple has decided to add the same feature to its desktop operating system in the middle of the standard release cycle. Apple usually saves most new features for major releases (the last of which was macOS Sierra), and you’d be forgiven for missing the feature if you’re in the habit of mindlessly installing updates. If you’ve not yet updated your Mac, you can do so by launching the Mac App Store and visiting the Updates tab. You should find the option to update your operating system at the top of the list. But make sure you have backed up your Mac The Best Data Recovery Software for Mac to Find Lost Data & Files The Best Data Recovery Software for Mac to Find Lost Data & Files Did your SSD happen to die?

Read More before you install it. If you can’t see the update in the App Store then you can download the combined 10.12.4 update from Apple and install it using the PKG installer. This will allow you to update any version of macOS Sierra from 10.12.0 onwards (hence, combined). Apart from Night Shift, update 10.12.4 is relatively uninteresting. Siri gets support for scores and statistics for the Indian Premier League and International Cricket Council, and Apple has added Dictation support for Shanghainese. There are other fixes and tweaks, increased RAW image file support, and some enterprise features that most of us will never touch. Ready for the Night Shift Both Night Shift and f.lux work by the same principle: our brains have come to rely on the sun’s light to reinforce our sleep and wake cycles. We’re used to seeing colder “blue” light in the morning when the sun rises, and warmer “orange” light at the end of the day when the sun is setting. Have you ever noticed that it’s hard to sleep immediately after using a computer or other device late at night? This could be due to excessive blue light signaling that it’s time to wake up. Night Shift and f.lux attempt to rectify this, though there’s evidence to suggest that simply filtering blue light isn’t enough Can F.lux & Night Shift Really Improve Your Sleep Habits? Can F.lux & Night Shift Really Improve Your Sleep Habits? Excessive use of computers, tablets, and smartphones can lead to deteriorated sleep quality -- but do apps like F.lux and Night Shift really counteract those effects? The science is pretty clear on this. Read More . You should stop staring at a screen a few hours before you want to sleep, but due to habits, work constraints, and the “always-on” nature of a connected world this isn’t possible. In this case, something is better than nothing. Enable and Configure Night Shift Once you’ve updated your Mac, you’ll find the option to toggle Night Shift in your Mac’s Notification Center. Click the icon in the top-right corner of your screen, or swipe with two fingers from the right-edge of your trackpad and scroll upwards to reveal the option. The feature works much better if you set it to a schedule, when it automatically enables itself at a time of your choosing. Head to System Preferences > Displays and click on the Night Shift tab. Here you can choose between manual activation, Sunset to Sunrise, and a Custom schedule to suit your habits. You can also configure just how warm you want the screen to appear. Click and drag the slider to a point you’re happy with — you can choose from barely noticeable to fake tan orange. There’s nothing else to change beyond these settings. The feature is pretty much identical to the iOS version. Night Shift or f.lux? Mac users have been able to access this sort of technology for years thanks to free cross-platform app f.lux and a few similar alternatives Save Your Eyes When Working at Night on Your Mac Save Your Eyes When Working at Night on Your Mac On a Mac, you still need to rely on third party solutions to protect your eyes during nighttime hours. Fortunately there are a few great options available. Read More . We’ve covered the app many times in the past Use F.lux To Sleep Better After Late-Night Computer Activities Use F.lux To Sleep Better After Late-Night Computer Activities Read More , and most users who value blue light filters will probably already be using the feature. Either way, it’s nice to have a choice. Night Shift is Apple’s own solution, so “it just works” albeit with a limited feature set. f.lux on the other hand is a project that’s been running for many years, on many different platforms. For that reason, users who appreciate more control might prefer it over Night Shift. f.lux has more options, and allows you to specify color temperature in kelvins, which ranges from 6500K (daylight) all the way down to 2700K (tungsten). The app also has three states — daylight, sunset, and bedtime — whereas Night Shift only has two. This allows you to gradually warm the screen over time. If you want your screen to be a deep orangey-red at night, f.lux is the app that will do it. It goes much further than Night Shift in this respect. It also has drawn some criticism from users complaining about purple artifacts while playing streaming video. Flux is about to have its user-base axed when Night Shift is released and native on Mac. — Stefan Etienne (@StefanEtienne) March 13, 2017 One important point to note is that users with older Mac computers that do not support macOS 10.12 Sierra will have to settle for f.lux. The feature will not be added to older versions of Apple’s operating system. If you haven’t yet upgraded to macOS Sierra 5 Reasons to Install macOS Sierra Right Now & How to Upgrade 5 Reasons to Install macOS Sierra Right Now & How to Upgrade After a few months of public beta, the latest version of Apple's desktop operating system is ready for prime time. Read More then you can check compatibility on Apple Support. Considering both solutions are free to try, why not try them both and see which you prefer? Mac Apps for Night Owls Night Shift and f.lux will satisfy the needs of most users. But they’re not the only solutions out there that can make working at night a more pleasant experience. Nocturne (Free) Nocturne is a longstanding solution for Mac users who operate in dark environments. The app hasn’t been updated since 2009, but we’ve tested it as working on macOS Sierra. The app lives in your menu bar and is manually activated using the Switch to Night button. By default, Nocturne will invert your screen, hide the desktop, and switch to a monochrome color scheme. You can also choose to tint your screen by setting custom colors for white and black. It’s free to download, so why not give it a spin. Shady (Free) Shady is another free app, though there’s an option to donate via PayPal on the project homepage. Just like Nocturne the app hasn’t seen an update in a while, having been written for OS X 10.5. It works just fine on macOS Sierra though, so it may still be worth your time. If you’re working in a very dark environment and you want to limit the amount of light coming out of your laptop, Shady works very well indeed. The app places a black “shade” over your screen, which you can adjust using the arrow keys. Ideally, you’ll want to lower your screen brightness. Then, launch Shady and tweak it till you’re happy with the image you see. It could be a lifesaver if Apple’s lowest brightness setting isn’t dark enough, or if you’re using your MacBook in bed and don’t want to blind whoever’s sleeping next to you. Darklight ($0.99) / Candlelight ($0.99) Darklight and Candlelight are two apps from the same developer, neither of which have been updated for a while. Darklight is arguably the most interesting of the two, as it’s designed for using a laptop in dark environments without causing eye strain or resetting your night vision. Many astronomers cover their laptop screens with a red film called Rubylith to maintain good night vision while in the field. Darklight attempts to recreate this red (or green) with software. Candlelight seems to be a more limited version of f.lux or Night Shift, so you might want to give it a miss. Work at Night ($2.99) Work at Night is an old app that last saw an update in 2011, and is untested on the latest version of macOS. It offers similar functionality to the free app Shady, so consider it if you can’t get Shady to work. Remember you can get an App Store refund if the software doesn’t work as expected. Working Late? Do you use an app like f.lux to tint your screen at night? Will you be moving over to Night Shift? Remember that the best way to get a good night’s sleep is to avoid backlit screens a few hours before bedtime No Sleep Is Deadly: 10 Web Services That Can Save Your Life No Sleep Is Deadly: 10 Web Services That Can Save Your Life Lack of sleep is a 21st Century reality.

The Apple I computer, in a prototype metal case, that founder Steve Jobs used as a demo model and which was taken from a shelf in his office in 1985. (Living Computers Photo) The Living Computers: Museum + Labs in Seattle is home to some of the most noteworthy machines ever created. But a new exhibit opening this week will showcase what one official at the Paul Allen-founded institution called “the most important computer in history.” Lāth Carlson, executive director of Living Computers, added to that designation by saying the metal box with a keyboard is “also the most boring to look at.” But for fans of computing and Apple in particular, the Apple I that once sat in founder Steve Jobs’ office is exciting for a whole host of reasons. The machine is the centerpiece of a new permanent Apple Computer Exhibit opening on Friday at the museum, in which visitors are invited to more closely examine the first two decades of Apple and the impact that the company’s people and products had on personal computing and the world as we know it today. On the second floor of the museum in Seattle’s SoDo neighborhood, curator Aaron Alcorn and his team have carved out a significant amount of space to tell Apple’s story from 1976 to 1999. The Jobs machine will be displayed alongside another Apple I, billed as the only operable version of the company’s first-ever product that will also be available for use by the public. Additional machines include original Apple II, IIe, IIc, Apple III, Lisa, and Macintosh computers, as well as a Bondi Blue iMac. A second, working Apple I computer that will be available for public use at the Living Computers: Museum + Labs in Seattle. (GeekWire Photo / Kurt Schlosser) Steve Wozniak’s BASIC runs on the Apple I at Living Computers. (GeekWire Photo / Kurt Schlosser) “About 200 of these were made, around 70 are known to have survived, and around seven are operable,” Carlson told GeekWire while showing off the museum’s working 1976 Apple I. “We’re going to be running Steve Wozniak’s version of BASIC that he wrote on it.” Carlson said the only other Apple I that’s been run recently, that the museum knows of, is a machine bought by The Henry Ford museum in Michigan for nearly $1 million. Carlson said it ran once. “We’ve set this up to run every day for about the next 10 years,” he said of the Living Computers machine, which was acquired about 11 years ago for an exhibition in Albuquerque, N.M., where Allen and Bill Gates originally started Microsoft. As for what Allen paid, Carlson would only say that the billionaire “got a very good deal” because at the time the machines were not considered the collectors items that they are today. The earliest details regarding Wozniak, Homebrew Computer Club in Palo Alto, Calif., Jobs, The Byte Shop, the $666.66 price point for the Apple I and much more are all part of the rich history on display in the new exhibit. “Things just kind of came together,” Alcorn said of the 4 1/2-month process of building it all out. “It was one of those things where I sent a quick email off to one of our archivists, ‘I really want this magazine,’ and then two days later, ‘Oh, we just got this donation, this is what you were looking for.'” Living Computers curator Aaron Alcorn shows off an Apple II in the new exhibit. (GeekWire Photo / Kurt Schlosser) It’s not a new concept for the museum — conceived of by the co-founder of Microsoft — to collect Apple items and put certain pieces on display. And the idea for the exhibit did actually come from Allen sometime last year. A flier for the first West Coast Computer Fair in 1977. “We’ve always actually had a fairly significant Apple collection, and we’ve always had Apples on display,” Carlson said. “I think people a lot of times come here and are a little surprised to see that. They associate us with Paul Allen, with Microsoft. And a lot of times people don’t realize Microsoft provided a lot of the early software and hardware for Apple, and continued to over the years. When Steve Jobs went back to Apple, there was a significant investment by Microsoft — $150 million — to keep the company basically going. And they agreed to keep providing Office for Macs.” The museum made a point of making sure that the long history of the two companies working together is told more comprehensively in the exhibit. “In the early days, there wasn’t this ‘I’m a Mac, I’m a PC’ thing going on,” Carlson said, referencing the 2006-era Apple ad campaign. “The two were so intertwined for the first 15 or 20 years.” The opening of the exhibit coincides with the 40th anniversary of the first West Coast Computer Faire, in San Francisco, which is where the Apple II was released. In 1980, Allen initiated the creation of the Microsoft SoftCard, allowing more software to run on Apple II computers and helping to accelerate Apple’s growth. The connection between the companies does eventually split in the exhibit, where IBM gets into the game and picks Microsoft’s operating system. Go one way and you’re into the rise of Windows 95, etc.; choose the other direction and you’re into Apple’s evolving story. Living Computers executive director Lāth Carlson discusses the period in which Steve Jobs was gone from Apple, as she shows a NeXTcube. (GeekWire Photo / Kurt Schlosser) “Think Different” and the introduction of the iMac “reclaimed the soul of the company” according to the Living Computers exhibit. (GeekWire Photo / Kurt Schlosser) And the Apple story isn’t all rosy. The release — and recall and re-release — of the business-oriented Apple III, for instance, was a total misstep for the company. But it was a big one, and Jobs is eventually pushed out in 1985. He goes on to start NeXT and get involved with Pixar and so on. Carlson said that Jobs was “never one to look back” which explains why Apple doesn’t seem to collect or showcase historical items like these on its own — and why Jobs would vacate his office and leave behind everything, including a piece of computing history.  In the early days, there wasn’t this ‘I’m a Mac, I’m a PC’ thing going on. The two were so intertwined for the first 15 or 20 years. After employees were invited to do so, an Apple engineer named Don Hutmacher walked into Jobs’s office and left with the Apple 1 and a pound of Starbucks coffee — another rarity in Silicon Valley 1985. Hutmacher was a huge fan of Apple, where he worked for about 20 years. After he passed away this past year, his family found the computer in his garage, where it had been sitting for about 30 years. Carlson said the machine, housed in a prototype metal case, was one that Jobs and Apple’s first investor, Mike Markkula, would take on the road to demonstrate its capabilities to potential investors. It had even been modified by Bill Fernandez, the first employee that Apple ever hired. But Jobs wouldn’t have gone looking for it when he eventually came back to Apple. “It didn’t have a value to him … he always was looking forward,” Carlson said. Eight siblings in the Hutmacher family recognized the significance, and agreed it should go to Living Computers. Lāth Carlson, right, and Aaron Alcorn of Living Computers reveal the case holding Steve Jobs’s Apple I computer.

Love visual aspect of news?: Enjoy this exclusive slideshows treat! NEW DELHI:The government on Monday reiterated its stance of not giving any relaxation to any foreign company from the compulsory 30% local sourcing norm, signalling that it would not extend such an incentive to iPhone maker Apple. “We do not want people coming to sell goods which can be manufactured without supporting the local ecosystem that we have,” commerce minister Nirmala Sitharaman said in reply to a Parliament question regarding Apple’s request. She was responding to the question if the government will relax the norm as requested by companies that want to set up plants “to manufacture iPhones and other items” to increase investment in manufacturing. Cupertino-based Apple had earlier asked the government to relax the 30% sourcing norms while submitting its proposal for single brand retail. This was refused by the finance ministry. Since then the company has changed its India plans and is looking to manufacture its products here. The company has asked for tax related incentives including 15-year custom duty exemption. The government is yet to take a call in the matter. Sitharaman, however, said: “On a blanket approach, we are not considering giving a chhoot’ for one company or the other.” Pointing out that small and medium sectors across the country have created capacities for a very long time, Sitharaman, who is also the industry minister, said that unless the local sourcing requirement is fulfilled, the government would not be able to support Indian industry under its ‘Make in India’ scheme.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Galaxy S8 vs. iPhone 7 Plus speed test: It’s not even close Image Source: Zach Epstein, BGR Zach Epstein @zacharye April 10th, 2017 at 9:16 AM Share Tweet Last week we showed you one of the first real world speed test videos to pit the new Galaxy S8 against the reigning speed champion, Apple’s iPhone 7 Plus. Unfortunately, we also explained why it was one of the worst speed test videos we had ever seen. None of these YouTube speed test videos are scientific, of course, but some tests are far more controlled than others. In this particular test, the narrator just tapped a bunch of apps and tried to eyeball which one opened faster each time. We were still waiting for some of the more experienced YouTube gadget vloggers to share their speed test results, and now we have a much better test to share. And to be quite frank, the results are shocking. Don't Miss: There’s only one thing keeping all these iPhone users from switching to the Galaxy S8 Each year when new flagship Android phones are released, tech fans scratch their heads as they fail to best Apple’s iPhones. On paper, iPhones have much less impressive specs, and yet Apple always manages to deliver the smoothest possible user experience time and time again. This year, Samsung’s new Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ completely crush Apple’s iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in terms of multi-core benchmark tests, though they still lagged behind Apple in single-core tests. In theory, that should mean Samsung’s new phones might be slower than iPhones at simple tasks, but the new Galaxy S8 phones should be clear leaders when it comes to heavy lifting like launching games and rendering 4K video. According to the results of a new real world speed test from YouTuber EverythingApplePro, that’s not the case at all. The speed test video below shows the Galaxy S8 pitted against the iPhone 7 Plus in a number of different ways. While the competition is close at times, it’s not close at all in the long run. The most interesting parts of the video show that Apple’s iPhone 7 Plus is much faster than the Galaxy S8 when it comes to things like rendering 4K video and launching graphics-heavy games. Anyone who had seen earlier multi-core benchmark tests would certainly have expected the opposite to be the case. Check out the full video, which is embedded below.

And the smartphone companies are driving the change Subscribe to our newsletter. Vishal Mathur Modern technology and connectivity mean that the occupants of such a car will have better entertainment options, as well as safety features. Cars today aren’t just about driving from points A to B, they are also about convenience, entertainment and security. If tail fins and chrome defined the automobile in the late 1950s and the “muscle-car” was the fashion in the 1960s and 1970s, we are now cruising into what is appropriately being called the “connected car” era, with Silicon Valley stars making their presence felt in what used to be Detroit territory. Modern technology and connectivity mean that the occupants of such a car will have better entertainment options, as well as safety features—buzzing a helpline automatically in case of an accident, for example. Then there is the real-time management system, providing updated traffic information, optimal route navigation and information on the car’s health, all aimed at making the drive safer, faster and more efficient. Do you scoff at the idea of a connected car? Well, according to navigation company TomTom, drivers in Moscow spend an average of 127 hours each year stuck in traffic—Beijing, Tokyo, Bangkok or New Delhi wouldn’t be very different. Moscow isn’t perceived as a city with bad traffic, but data suggests it is. This is where cloud-based data and smart algorithms become relevant, be it for navigation, communication, safety or security. The change is upon us So, what are the elements of a modern-day connected vehicle? Take the example of Swedish carmaker Volvo. Its Volvo On Call app (Android and iOS) hosts a bunch of cloud-based services that allow you to remotely control some of the functions with your phone or smartwatch. You can locate the car, send navigation directions, unlock doors, monitor fuel, pre-manage the cabin’s temperature, make a Wi-Fi zone, even call for emergency assistance. A truly connected smart car will have a processing unit, a bevy of sensors, storage and smart software to run all the features—think of your car as your laptop, only many times more powerful. “Integration of connected devices to avoid distracted driving is the key. Infotainment is no longer limited to audio and video systems in the car. Seamless intelligence transcending devices (these work together as well), including sensors, cameras, tablets, smartphones, navigation system and infotainment systems, is imperative,” says Tom von Bonsdorff, managing director, Volvo Auto India. Infotainment: The driving soundtrack Over the years, perhaps the biggest disappointment has been the factory-fitted music system. For, unless you have splurged on a Jaguar XE sedan, for instance, with the InControl Touch and Meridian music systems, the experience would rank somewhere between clunky and exasperating. Now, tech giants Apple and Google want to put your smartphone at the very centre of the experience. With their CarPlay and Android Auto systems, respectively, they seamlessly integrate hands-free calling features, music streaming, maps, navigation and more, all with voice commands. It becomes easy for the person driving to make or receive calls, change the music or even use navigation guidance, all without the driver needing to take their eyes off the road. In 2015, Maruti Suzuki was the first to introduce Apple CarPlay in India as part of the SmartPlay infotainment platform, which is now available in their Baleno hatchback, Ciaz sedan and Brezza crossover, among others. The platform has now also been updated to add support for Android Auto, which is being rolled out with the Ignis hatchback. “The major risk associated with Apple CarPlay was the acceptability of the feature by Indian car consumers. The feature can be best experienced with good Internet speed, which is a major challenge in the Indian context,” says C.V. Raman, executive director (engineering), Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. It took time for rival carmakers to take the hint, but the likes of Hyundai, for example, have joined the party, with the new Elantra sedan, and also the 2017 Elite i20 hatchback and the 2017 Creta crossover. If you aren’t buying a new car anytime soon, Pioneer Electronics is selling a range of in-car entertainment after-market options that can be installed in your existing vehicle—the AVH-X8890BT (Rs39,990), AVIC-F70BT (Rs49,990) and AVIC-F80BT (Rs51,990) are some systems that support both CarPlay and Android Auto. Sony offers the XAV-AX100 (Rs26,990) infotainment system, with similar capabilities for supporting your smartphone. Both Apple and Google are working on updates to further improve in-car infotainment experience. In fact, the latest iOS 10.3 software now rolling out for the iPhone tweaks the interface and improves ease of use of apps such as Apple Music and Maps. Safety and maintenance: The value additions Smart features aren’t only about entertainment. Ford’s Sync system, for instance, can automatically call the emergency helpline with location coordinates. The new Ford Endeavour has advanced sensors that can semi-automatically park the mammoth vehicle for you. Honda as well as Mahindra and Mahindra now offer apps that connect your phone with your car and send you a treasure trove of information. If you happen to own a Honda car (City, Amaze and Jazz included), the Connect (Rs7,999) plugs into the car’s on-board diagnostics port, and pairs with your iPhone or Android phone. What you get is access to vehicle data, including engine and battery health, ability to locate the vehicle, analyse driving quality, service reminders, even call the helpline in case of an accident. “Cars are increasingly taking the place of a second home and we believe that customers are progressing rapidly. They are looking forward to entertainment and convenience as an option easily made available,” says Guillaume Sicard, president, Nissan India operations. Big business Tech companies understand the market potential. Research firm McKinsey and Co. suggests that the global market for connectivity components and services will reach €170 billion (around Rs11.8 trillion) by 2020, up from just €30 billion in 2014. Research firm PwC suggests that worldwide sales of connected-car products will increase almost fourfold by 2020 and will be worth $149 billion (around Rs9.7 trillion) for the passenger cars that you and I will probably buy. In October, chipmaker Qualcomm said it would acquire semiconductor manufacturer NXP and its portfolio of automotive micro controllers for a total enterprise value of approximately $47 billion, which makes Qualcomm the world’s largest automotive chipmaker. Security fears There is just one catch: genuine fears about connected car security. In February, security firm Kaspersky Labs’ report suggested that what you do with your phone too has a huge bearing on your connected car’s security. One fear is that malicious users may find a vulnerability that would allow them to obtain access to the server that sends the data to the car’s on-board system. So you should not install unverified apps on your phone, and avoid unauthorized software tweaks (such as “rooting” an Android phone) that will alter the built-in security mechanisms. *** Cars for the geeks You don’t need to get into the luxury brand territory to own a car that has a reasonable tech quotient. The more affordable hatchbacks and sedans are now smarter than ever before Maruti Suzuki Ignis Maruti Suzuki Ignis Rs4.59 lakh onwards (ex-showroom, Delhi) This hatchback is the first in its segment to offer CarPlay and Android Auto, making it a breeze to stream music, navigate, and more. It doesn’t fall short on safety either, with dual airbags, an anti-lock braking system (ABS) and electronic brakeforce distribution (EBD). Mahindra XUV500 Mahindra XUV500 Rs12,46,631 onwards (ex-showroom, Delhi) With the Blue Sense app (Android and iOS), you can control media as well as air conditioning and access data such as fuel mileage. The tyre pressure monitoring system will alert you if there are abnormal temperature changes or when leakage is detected. Honda WR-V/Honda City Honda WR-V/Honda City Rs7.75 lakh onwards/Rs8,49,990 onwards (ex-showroom, Delhi) Honda’s new DigiPad infotainment system offers voice commands for phone calls and media playback. It is perplexing that Honda didn’t think CarPlay and Android Auto were important enough. But it makes up for that with a navigation system that offers traffic updates, and a built-in Web browser. Hyundai Elantra Hyundai Elantra Rs12.99 lakh onwards (ex-showroom, Delhi) The Elantra now has CarPlay and Android Auto, as well as an 8-inch HD touchscreen. It also includes French audio brand Arkamys’ smart sound algorithms—they match the music genre and surroundings to improve clarity and minimize audio quality loss.

Networking | 10 Apr 2017 | Print  | Comment (9) Verizon to Drop Email Service by Josh Centers If Verizon is your ISP, and you use a verizon.net email address, we have some bad news: Verizon has announced that it’s shutting down its email business. This move may affect more than 1100 TidBITS and Take Control readers. (Joe Kissell addressed a number of the issues raised by Verizon’s move in “FlippedBITS: Misconceptions about Changing Email Addresses,” 4 March 2014.) Verizon hasn’t specified exactly when the shutdown will happen, but the good news is that you will be able to keep your verizon.net email address. Now for some potentially bad news: if you decide to keep your Verizon email address, you’ll have to use it with the free AOL Mail service. Verizon purchased AOL in 2015 in what was thought to be strictly a content play, but now it looks as though that Verizon had some other ideas in mind as well (see “Verizon to Buy AOL,” 12 May 2015). The upside if this approach is that Verizon will transfer your email messages, contacts, and calendars automatically. If you decide to switch to another email host, you’ll have until the shutdown date to migrate your email and other data to your new address. Verizon says that when you log into webmail.verizon.com, you should see an “Email service notice” with further information and instructions. Verizon also says that it will post the shutdown date there. I recommend transferring your existing verizon.net email address to AOL Mail, even if you don’t plan to use it. That way, even if you switch providers, you can still have AOL Mail forward any stray messages to your new address. There are a couple of ways to do this: Techwalla explains how to set up forwarding from AOL, while the Houston Chronicle describes a method that takes advantage of Gmail’s POP3 import to download mail directly from AOL. This latter method should also work with most other email providers. If you’re shopping for a new email service, we can offer a few suggestions. Google’s Gmail is an obvious choice, and it’s TidBITS publisher Adam Engst’s preference. Gmail is free and offers innovative features, but it’s designed to be used via its Web interface or native iOS apps. Or, you can be like Adam and use Mailplane, which wraps the Gmail Web interface in a native Mac app (see “Zen and the Art of Gmail, Part 4: Mailplane,” 16 March 2011). If you want to access Gmail via Apple Mail or another standard IMAP client, you may run into usage quirks, since Google bolted on Gmail’s IMAP support afterward. Apple’s iCloud email is another obvious choice, though it’s not as feature-rich as Gmail. Plus, if storing your mail in iCloud pushes you over the 5 GB of storage space that you get for free, you’ll need to pay Apple for more. However, iCloud email is second to none in terms of integration with Apple devices and can be used on other platforms. Our own Michael Cohen has been using it as his primary email account since the days of iTools. Several other TidBITS contributors and I use FastMail, which is a paid service, but it works well with Apple Mail, offers excellent customer support, and lets you use your own domain name. FastMail is the only non-Apple email provider I’m aware of that offers IMAP push email on iOS. FastMail’s spam filtering isn’t as good as Gmail’s, but I’ve found that C-Command Software’s SpamSieve does a fantastic job. (TidBITS members receive a 20 percent discount on SpamSieve.) The painful part of any email migration is moving existing messages from your old account to the new one. Gmail and FastMail both offer instructions on how to do this. You can also use Apple Mail to transfer mail between accounts manually by copying messages from a mailbox in one IMAP account to another mailbox in a different IMAP account. We’ve found that such transfers usually work fine for a relatively small number of messages, but trying to do a complete migration that way may require a lot of babysitting, restarting, and verification work. Email is a complex topic, so you have questions that you’d like us to cover more in-depth in future articles, let us know in the comments!   READERS LIKE YOU!

Receive comments via RSS Add a comment Jeff Hecht  2017-04-10 16:03 One important note, and one additional option to consider. Verizon is handling this oddly, and their FAQs say they will notify you when it's time to move. So you will not find any notice in your Verizon Webmail (or wherever you get your Verizon email) until they're ready. Also, you can use Apple Mail to download GMail with POP3, if that works for you. Be aware that with POP3 GMail keeps spam in a folder that you can only see in webmail. Reply Lindsley Williams   2017-04-10 16:54 In another list community, I read that Google Docs is not HIPPA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996) compliant. Is there a way to establish if the various email providers are or can be set to be so? Reply Adam Engst   2017-04-10 17:16 Google is your friend: http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&gfns=1&q=hippa+compliant+email+providers Sounds like the free version of Gmail is not HIPPA-compliant, but the paid version is. Reply gastropod  2017-04-10 19:12 Well, it's HIPAA compliant IF you have a signed contract for your circumstances. E.g. paid Google Docs has HIPAA on a feature checklist, which means that they're willing to enter into such a contract. At my university, Google Docs (logged into the correct way) is HIPAA (and FERPA) compliant because lawyers made it so, but if I just got a paid Google Docs account for myself, it wouldn't be. Reply Scott Hoenig  2017-04-10 16:58 It seems like if you use the Mac Mail program for your mail client, or any other mail client, the SMTP/POP settings will continue to work. You have to tell them you want to keep your Verizon.net address, but that's it. The only change would be if you want web mail access. So Verizon is keeping its mail servers--they're just dropping support for their web mail application. That's what I can figure out from the FAQs they have. Reply Scott Hoenig  2017-04-10 21:58 I forgot to mention that you also need to make sure you set your "new" AOL webmail password to match your existing Verizon mail password, or you have to change that in the Apple Mail settings, as well. Reply Peter Flint  2017-04-10 21:19 Just an aside that in addition to Mailplane, Postbox works pretty well with Gmail as an alternative to Apple Mail, and looks and feels very similar to Mail, in a good way. I made the switch a few years ago when Mail got wiggy with Gmail. No regrets. Reply linda  2017-04-11 01:01 Another very good paid email service is Hushmail. They do support imap for the iPhone. They have personal and business plans with varied data storage. Works with Mail/Thunderbird/Postbox, etc. or their web interface. They even have free web only accounts. You can send encrypted emails, have aliases, security features, HIPPA-compliant, and they are pretty reliable. Reply rwwilson147  2017-04-11 02:19 Yup, Email is a complex topic. I left ATT as an ISP a few months ago and my swbell.net att.yahoo email account seems to have lost its outbound mail function. I've been using Thunderbird for many years but it looks like I'm going to need a new client. I'm having to use the online Yahoo mail site for swbell.net email Send function now, which I don't like much. Rather better to have the whole database including Sent, etc., on one's hard drive. Do you have suggestions for me? Thanks for you work and any suggestions you may have to ease my transition.

[ClickPress, Sat Apr 08 2017] Saginaw Snacks, LLC announced Friday that is has officially added two new flavors to its product offering.

Digital Trends Home > DT Daily > Google looks to LG for Pixel OLED screens after… Google looks to LG for Pixel OLED screens after Apple’s big order with Samsung By Bill Roberson — April 10, 2017 12:10 PM Share Please enable Javascript to watch this video Subscribe on YouTube Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Curves ahead A week after Apple placed a massive order for OLED iPhone screens with arch-rival Samsung, Google is apparently working on pretty much the same thing – except with Korean tech giant and arch rival LG. And guess what? Electronic Times is reporting that the order is for “curved screens,” just like Apple. And again, we are expecting the OLED screens, likely meant for a new Pixel phone, to wrap around the edges of the device. How many screens? While Apple’s order topped 90 million – and perhaps many more later on – no figures were released on the Google/LG order, but Google is reportedly paying nearly $900 million dollars for the order, so we’ll just guess and say “a whole lot of them.” When the original Pixel phones debuted, Google was often caught short on stock. Just like Apple, it looks like they’re hoping to have a lot of phones on hand when it debuts, perhaps later this year. The (nearly) silent service Ford is rolling out a new car for police departments, and not surprisingly, it’s a Ford Fusion hybrid. How will they ever catch any bad guys while driving a lethargic hybrid? Well, to borrow a few lines from a classic movie, this is no ordinary hybrid, this thing is pursuit rated. It’s got a cop motor, cop tires, cop shocks, skid plates for driving over curbs, and it’s made in 2017, so it’ll run good on regular gas – on electricity. Cop cars burn up to 60 percent of their gas at just sitting at idle, and since the engine in the Ford hybrid is off while it’s… idling, Ford says each car should save police departments nearly $4,000 in gas per car per year. Ford calls the Fusion Hybrid a “Police Responder,” and says it’s more for urban duties, despite its “pursuit” rating. Out on the open roads, big-bore all-gas cop cars, like the 150-mile an hour Dodge Charger, will still chase down the bad guys. Plenty fast, but…. The Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus is finally out, and since it’s packing as much cutting edge tech as Samsung could cram into the thing, it must be a real hot-rod when it comes to performance, right? Well, maybe. According to a side-by-side speed test posted by Everything Apple Pro on YouTube, the Galaxy S8 came in second on multiple speed tests against an iPhone 7 Plus, despite having more RAM and other more up-to-date features. The S8 runs the Snapdragon 835 quad-core processor at 2.35 gigahertz while the iPhone uses Apple proprietary in-house A10 chip, and only 3 gigs of RAM. So how is it winning? There are so many variables outside of pure processor speed: how the OS works, speed of RAM, graphics processing, and so on. Overall, the phones were pretty close in performance – the S8 is still a fast phone – we just felt it was interesting that an older competitor was still faster in almost every test they could come up with. Hit this link to watch the whole video.

Apple even took Samsung to court in an epic, multiyear legal battle over designs and alleged patent violations. But now something unusual is happening in the smartphone world: Apple and Google are copying Samsung. Back in 2015, Samsung brought out the Galaxy S6, a premium handset, and alongside it, the S6 Edge — a sister device that featured a curved screen along the edges. It followed it up with the S7 and the S7 Edge in 2016. Then last month it announced the Galaxy S8, which makes the curved screen standard and radically shrinks the bezels at the top and bottom of the device so the front is almost nothing but OLED screen. While the S8 hasn't officially been released to the public (that is set for later this month), initial hands-on reviews from journalists have been pretty positive, with the innovative design getting praise. And according to the latest rumours, it sounds as if both Apple and Google plan to copy that design in their coming flagship phones. First, Apple: The Cupertino, California-based technology company is expected to unveil a 10th-anniversary edition of the iPhone this autumn. The "iPhone 8" is rumoured to be getting a major redesign — including a curved S8-style OLED screen. And Google also is due to bring out the second version of its high-end Pixel phone later this year. The latest reports suggest that it too will come with a flexible OLED screen that's curved. (In both cases, the usual caveats apply: These are rumours, not confirmed features, and the companies almost never discuss coming products before they are formally announced.) Samsung Galaxy S8 Samsung This is a remarkable turn of events. Samsung's devices, while high-quality, typically hew closely to Apple's style. In a 132-page document from 2010, Samsung detailed how it could make its phones better — by making them resemble the iPhone much more closely. Apple has waged war on Samsung in the courts for years. But this time around, Samsung is leading the way — and Apple and Google are playing catch-up. This article was originally published on Business Insider. Copyright 2017.

Here’s how to redeem them. There are several ways to redeem an iTunes gift card, and Apple makes it as easy as taking a picture of the gift card to automatically redeem it to your iTunes account, but there are also other options that you can take advantage of, including redeeming a gift card on your computer as well. You can receive iTunes gift cards at denominations as low as $10, which only retail stores sell. Apple itself only sells $25, $50, and $100 iTunes gift cards, although it used to sell a $15 options not too long ago. That sounds like a lot of money to have earmarked for just iTunes, but with more and more apps coming with in-app purchases, you’d be surprised by how much you can spend on apps and games. In any case, if you received an iTunes gift card for Christmas, here are multiple ways that you can redeem it and get to app shopping without wasting time. Redeem iTunes Gift Cards on iPhone or iPad Perhaps the easiest way to redeem an iTunes gift card on your iPhone or iPad is by using the device’s camera to take a picture of the card and have it automatically be redeemed for you, without entering any long string of numbers. To do this, open up the App Store app on your iPhone or iPad and scroll all the way down. Tap on the Redeem button. From there, you’ll have to enter in your Apple ID password. The next screen is where you’ll choose an option for redeeming an iTunes gift card. You have a choice between Use Camera or You can also enter your code manually. If you want to use the camera, simply select that option and point the camera at the back of the iTunes gift card, making sure that the redeem code is scratched off beforehand. If done correctly, your iTunes gift card will automatically be redeemed and you should see a message saying that the redemption was successful. From there, tap on Done in the upper-right corner of the screen. If you choose to enter the code manually, simply enter it in using the keyboard and then tap on Redeem in the upper-right corner. Redeem iTunes Gift Cards on Your Computer If you don’t have an iPhone or an iPad, but use an iPod or a Mac for your iTunes needs, you can use your computer to redeem iTunes gift cards. On your Mac, you can use the FaceTime camera to redeem an iTunes gift card, similar to how it can be done on the iPhone or iPad. To do this, open the App Store on your Mac and click Redeem under Quick Links in the right-hand sidebar. You’ll need to enter in your Apple ID password to continue. From there, you can click on Use Camera or enter in the code manually in the text box below that. If you’re on a Windows machine, you simply follow the same steps on Mac, but the only difference is that you won’t have the option of using the camera. Instead, you’ll have to enter in the iTunes code manually. From there, your iTunes gift card will be redeemed and you can begin to shop for music, movies, apps, games, etc. 4 Responses 12/29/2015 Ashley Reply How do your redeem using an iPod?

Samsung makes a bunch of tablets, but its "S" models are always the best. The Galaxy Tab S3 follows last year's Galaxy Tab S2, which seemed to pass under most people's radars even though it was a solid slate. This year's model kicks butt, and it's easily one of the best tablets you can buy right now. It even outclasses the iPad Pro 9.7 in a few important areas, though there are some other aspects that aren't as good. We'll walk you through everything. It's similar to the iPad Pro 9.7... Devin Hance | CNBC First, the Galaxy Tab S3 has the same size 9.7-inch display as the smaller iPad Pro, and it's the same resolution, which means text and images are going to look just as sharp. It uses Samsung's high-end AMOLED panel, though, so you'll get much brighter colors. Your eyes sink right into the screen when viewing back really colorful images and movies. Like the iPad, the Galaxy Tab S3 is ideal not only for viewing content, but for creating it. Devin Hance | CNBC Samsung includes an S-Pen stylus that works really well and compares similarly to the Apple Pencil (which isn't included with the iPad Pro.) The S Pen can be used for drawing, painting and jotting down quick notes. There's even a feature that lets you jot down a quick note without having to unlock the tablet, which is super convenient. Devin Hance | CNBC The Tab S3 also supports a keyboard — a $129.99 accessory — and, like the iPad Pro, there's a smart connector on one side of the tablet that allows you to connect it without any sort of Bluetooth pairing. It just snaps right into place and starts working. Four stereo speakers sit on each corner of the device, as they also do on the iPad Pro. The Tab S3's speakers got nice and loud when I put the tablet on my coffee table and played a 60s playlist on Spotify while tidying up the living room one Saturday, and I really liked the clear audio while watching "Caddy Shack" from the couch. The similarities end there The Galaxy Tab S3 runs Android Nougat, the latest version of Google's software. It allows you to run apps side-by-side, similar to what Apple allows on its iPad Pro products, and even pop-out video for picture-in-picture viewing while performing other tasks. I'm worried about Android on tablets, though. Google frequently talks about Android for smartphones, but hasn't really discussed the OS for tablets recently. That makes me wonder how serious the future of Android tablets really is, and whether or not Google is putting its eggs into Chrome OS instead. Also, Samsung's updates are typically slow, so you might not get the latest version of Android for many months after it releases, if ever. Conversely, Apple updates its iPads frequently, and often supports individual models for many years. That's something to keep in mind. Devin Hance | CNBC Also, while developers have spent plenty of time optimizing applications for Apple's iPad — since they sell millions of units a quarter — developers aren't doing the same for Android tablets. Don't expect to find a ton of applications that support Android tablets or larger screens, for example. Instead, you'll mostly be using regular smartphone apps that are just blown up to take up the whole screen. That stinks. Those qualms about Android aside, the Tab S3 experience is really solid. Samsung includes one of Qualcomm's new processors under the hood, and it's nice and fast, allowing you to run multiple apps at once without running into hiccups. You can even upgrade the storage for more movies and apps, something Apple doesn't let you do with the iPad. Devin Hance | CNBC Speaking of movies, the Galaxy Tab S3's display supports full HDR viewing. HDR, if you're unfamiliar, is otherwise known as high dynamic range. The gist is that the image you're viewing is supposed to look more accurate, as Hollywood originally intended, thanks to a balance between the darkest colors on the screen and the brightest. There are a limited number of sources to actually view that content now – Amazon lets you stream HDR content for some of its shows - so that's not exactly a huge win over the iPad. You don't need to worry about movies hogging battery life, either. Devin Hance | CNBC Samsung promises up to 12 hours of video playback. That's enough for two cross-country flights. In my tests, I was easily able to make it through a weekend using the tablet for surfing the net, watching movies and playing some games. You'll want to keep the display brightness down, though, since it can really chug your battery's juice when it's up high. Worth considering Most people should just buy an iPad Pro 9.7. I understand iPads aren't for everyone, however, and that some consumers still really like Android on tablets. If you're in that group of consumers, the Galaxy Tab S3 is the best tablet you can buy.

FiiO is a Chinese company best known for their range of portable and desktop headphone amplifiers, DACs, and digital audio players. FiiO may not be a household name outside the audiophile community, but that may soon change (or at least it should) as the company releases its new line of MFi-certified products. The first of that line is the i1 ($40), a universal Lightning to 3.5mm headphone adapter. While it certainly does the job, the limited features it adds over the Apple adapter might not be enough to justify its price for everyone. Not to deny FiiO their own identity, but one of the things we like most about their products is how much they remind us of Apple’s design - simple, elegant, and clean. Most of their gear comes in sleek black aluminum housings. Their portable audio players fill the gap left by the now-discontinued iPod classic, but with more features and more powerful output. Their portable amplifiers can drive a wide range of headphones, and are priced low enough for those just starting their audiophile journey. We have owned plenty of FiiO products in the past, and we plan to review as many as we can get our hands on. The i1 is technically a portable DAC and amplifier combo. It ships in simple packaging, with no accessories except for a small plastic alligator clip. Its construction is classic FiiO – a sturdy black aluminum tube with a tasteful chamfered ring at the bottom – it puts the Apple adapter’s plastic construction to shame. Top-to-bottom, we find a 3.5mm headphone jack, microphone, familiar three-button controls, and an 80cm cable terminated in a Lightning plug. Its design is deceptively simple – inside, FiiO packed high-quality components that can be upgraded to add features in the future. The i1’s controls are satisfyingly clicky and work exactly as you’d expect, albeit with a slightly longer lag than we are used to. The i1 worked with all our apps, call quality was excellent for both sides of the conversation, and we had no problem using its microphone to talk to Siri. In our testing, we experienced occasional blips and hiccups, and a few times had to unplug and re-insert the i1 to get the microphone to work. We are hesitant to blame this on the i1, however, because we have experienced these types of anomalies with other Lightning accessories as well. In any event, a restart of the iPhone always seems to clear things up. One oddity, however, is that there seemed to be a large jump in volume between the 9th and 10th volume step on our iPhones; the Apple adapter’s volume steps were more linear in our testing. We think the most polarizing feature of the i1 will be its cable. It is undoubtedly of higher quality than that of the Apple adapter (about 1mm thicker in diameter), but it’s also 80cm long. At that length, it extends the cables of most portable headphones to over 6 feet in total. We found this to be nearly unmanageable when out walking with headphones and the i1; we had to repeatedly coil the cable or stuff it into our pockets to avoid having it catch on things around us. We don’t blame FiiO for designing the i1 this way – in order to add controls and a microphone, it would not have made sense to make the cable as short as that of the Apple adapter. Ultimately, we found it best to wrap up the excess cable with a twist-tie when walking, and use the extra length only when we needed it. FiiO claims that users will be able to change various settings on the i1 using a free companion app. We tried the app, but did not find any such features in the current version. FiiO tells us that a version of the app with more functionality is currently pending approval by Apple but, for now, the app doesn’t add anything to the experience. FiiO’s website says that the i1 “automatically detects if you are using a standard headphone or one with in-line controls.” We’re not exactly sure what this means - when we used headphones with inline controls, the controls did not work when connected to the i1. Based on our prior experience with FiiO, we’re inclined to give them some leeway on missing features - FiiO tends to be good about adding features and supporting its products long after launch. For this review, we felt it was especially important to compare the i1 to the Lightning adapter that iPhone users already have. For this test, we set up two iPhones playing identical tracks at the same volume and connected them to an A/B switch; one using the FiiO i1, the other using the Apple Lightning adapter. Honestly, we did not expect to hear a difference. To our surprise, after trying a variety of headphones and tracks we found an audible difference between the two devices - the i1 has a slightly more balanced sound than the Apple adapter which, by comparison, has a slightly more V-shaped sound (bass & treble boost). According to the specifications available, the two adapters have about the same power output, so maximum volume levels were about the same on both. We think that the more neutral sound will be appealing to audiophiles, who often prefer to avoid coloration in the signal chain. Nearly everyone who is using a current-generation iPhone needs this kind of adapter, and FiiO has a rare chance to beat Apple at its own game. However, the biggest challenge facing the i1 is that it’s competing with a product that most of its target market has already received for free. The i1 offers tangible benefits over the Apple adapter – a more balanced sound, better build quality, a longer cable, and the ability to add inline controls and a microphone to regular headphones – but costs more than four times its price. If FiiO fixes some bugs and delivers additional features in firmware updates, the i1 will probably become an even more compelling product. Until then, however, we would limit our recommendation to those users who really need its functionality. For everyone else, keep an eye on the i1 – it’s got plenty of potential. Comments It's not surprising the audio quality differences... There must be a DAC built into that dongle, and probably it's not the same one Apple adapter equips...

Compared to what we have today, the car that opened up the automotive market in the U.S. was none of those things -- yet it was incredibly successful. So, this is about perception, which is why the iPod -- which also was none of those things initially, if compared to the iPhone or iPad of today -- also was incredibly successful. The difference comes down to expectations and marketing, and like quadrophonic sound, 3D and video disks, VR doesn't yet have the right stuff. I'll explain and then close with my product of the week: something that can make your older car smarter and maybe help keep your driving kid out of trouble. The Completeness Test Any of us who saw Star Trek: The Next Generation or the more practical -- from a virtual reality perspective -- Assassin's Creed, know what a complete VR product experience should be. It should feel like you are actually in the virtual world and not in some form of performance art for your laughing friends. The gap between where expectations have been set for VR, thanks to the movies, and where the technology currently is appears to be massive. This means one of two things needs to be done: The technology either has to advance massively, or expectations have to be reset. These two things aren't mutually exclusive. In the short term, I think what is needed is to focus on what VR does best -- and that is play scripted content (movies), as well as seated, static games. Where VR gets into trouble is in RPGs (role-playing games) and FPSes (first-person shooters). This is because when VR demands movement from the player, it gets not only less realistic but also dangerous. You can lose your balance, trip over the tether, or have accidents with things in the room where you're playing that you can't see with the goggles on. None of this is fun, even though it can be entertaining for anyone watching you. To get even this limited range of games to work realistically, developers need to improve the controllers, which largely don't feel like or physically compare to what a user is viewing in the headset. For example, they don't have the weight and heft of guns for a (static) arcade shooter, and they don't simulate the controls you otherwise might be able to get for a driving or flying game. Further, using a simulator to add physical motion is expensive, and the motion may not sync with your preferred title. This is all do to a lack of focus. Rather than trying to get a few things right, like Steve Jobs did with the iPod or Henry Ford did with the Model T, folks are all over the map with regard to what they want to do with these headsets. That has resulted in a lack of critical mass in both titles and controllers to make the technology sing. Fixing this issue wouldn't address the entire problem, because expectations are in the stratosphere. Someone needs to be willing to market this technology as compelling for what it does, so we can reset expectations to something more reasonable than the holodeck. Since no one is making much money, though, no one wants to spend much on the related marketing. So, the solution appears incomplete and may continue to appear incomplete to buyers, both in title breadth and experience quality. Is It Compelling? Making something new compelling is all about marketing. The idea of having all your music in your pocket was enough to push the iPod through what was a very difficult three-year start, but when it exited that three-year ramp, it transformed Apple and the consumer electronics industry. VR needs a well-funded marketing campaign, but companies that typically are willing to carry the burden of market maker are few and far between, largely because everyone and their brother then slipstreams the effort. For instance, Apple was the market maker for the screen smartphone, but Google, which expended a tiny fraction of Apple's budget, now has more market share. That is in part because the money it saved in not building the market helped it give away its iOS competitor for free. (To this day, I don't know how Google got away with what clearly was predatory pricing.) Apple is rumored to have a VR effort coming but the ability for a challenger to avoid that expense -- and by doing so, steal the market -- is a solid argument for not being the market maker. Sony is trying to be a market maker, but its console approach is expensive for an attachment, and there has been no gaming title to make the VR attachment a must-have. Plus, Sony just doesn't seem to have either the will to innovate or the budget it once had for the PlayStation. Without a market maker, folks aren't likely to lust after a VR headset -- and without enough headsets, you can't fund title creation or the accessories you need to move the offering forward. The Value Proposition When the HTC and Oculus headsets hit the market, they cost around a grand. That's a lot, given that you also needed a gaming machine that cost twice as much. Three grand is a lot to pay for a technology that isn't yet complete or compelling, and sales have reflected this problem. However, we are about to be up to our eyeballs in US$350 headsets, thanks largely to Microsoft. Also, there are number of folks creating backpack PCs with VR chops, which are affordable largely due to AMD's efforts to make dramatic reductions in the price of the graphics cards needed to carry this off. When you start with something costing $3K and quickly drop the solution below $1K, you have the opportunity to create the perception of a very strong value -- but someone still has to deliver that message, taking us back to the problem of not really having a strong market maker yet. Wrapping Up: Microsoft Microsoft is about to launch an effort to become the market maker for VR with the coming release of a massive number of affordable headsets -- and, I expect, a decent amount of new (and we'll hope compelling) new content. Perhaps Microsoft will do a better job with the controller problem than we have seen so far, but if they don't, the market for VR is likely to remain tepid until someone with the resources and capabilities of Steve Jobs' Apple steps in and checks all the boxes. Sadly, the tech segment often is defined by companies that view a list of requirements as multiple choice rather than all of the above. If that is the case with VR, then it will go the way of 3D -- but it still has the potential to become transformative. We'll see. Unless you drive a Tesla, it's likely that your car is not truly connected. Granted, given the problem that Chrysler had with its connected technology, that actually might be a good thing. However, it limits what you can do with your car in terms of automated help, locating the damn thing, and tracking whoever is driving it. Automatic Pro may help. I had the last edition of this product in two cars, but it required a connection to my smartphone, which often isn't ideal and doesn't help you much if you misplaced the thing, or your smartphone is broken or its battery is dead. Automatic Pro Adapter The big change with this new Automatic Pro product is that it has built in 3G connectivity so it can phone home as long as it can see a 3G connection. This last is, of course, a caution, because one of the features is its ability to call for help automatically if you are in an accident -- but if it can't get a signal or it loses power, that clearly won't work. You can use this to track your kid's driving, because it doesn't need to connect to the phone. It will report some of the bad behaviors I engaged in as a kid, but texting and drinking and driving aren't yet within its capabilities. Still, for a lot of us who travel, the ability to locate the car in a huge airport parking lot alone may make this thing worthwhile. For those of us who have older non-connected cars and want to get a taste of the Tesla experience -- though it is just a taste -- Automatic's Pro Gold (AUT-350c) solution is provides it, and it's my product of the week.

Video’ archive surfaces Zac Hall - Apr. 10th 2017 10:54 am PT @apollozac Mac Apple YouTube View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Reddit pointed out this morning that the invaluable ‘EveryAppleVideo’ YouTube channel has gone dark for unknown reasons. Visiting the channel page takes you to an empty channel under a banner reading ‘This channel was closed and is no longer available.’ without further explanation. Sony A6500 ‘Previously the channel hosted 1000+ Apple ads, keynotes, and other videos dating back to the 80s which served as the ultimate archive of sorts. Apple hosts its own ads and keynotes on YouTube regularly, although videos are frequently replaced when new material becomes available. One possibility is the channel was taken down over copyright issues considering the videos all originated from Apple, although Reddit points out that a copyright message would likely appear if the channel was taken down over violations. It’s still possible, however, that the owner received external complaints over copyright violations and proactively removed content from the channel. The good news? There already appears to be a replacement surfacing. ‘Every ? Video’ is a new channel currently publishing what appears to be the same content that EveryAppleVideo previously published. The channel makes no mention of Apple in its name, which may be a safe play if that was the issue, although the video content is surely all subject to the same violations if that was the issue. The channel description matches the previous channel, for what it’s worth: From vintage Apple gems from the 80’s, to dazzling promos, to confidential internal videos, to cheesy sales training, to useful guided tours, you’ll find it here in this ever growing archive of everything Apple. Here’s the iconic 1984 Macintosh ad as one example of the new channel’s videos. We’ll see how long it sticks around.

Watch for Microsoft's "Project Scorpio" Xbox to make an impact on the gaming market later this year. (omihay/Shutterstock) REINHARDT KRAUSE 4/10/2017 Reprints Microsoft's (MSFT) ambitions in augmented and virtual reality are going to get a big lift from the "Project Scorpio" Xbox gaming console due out this fall, says Loup Ventures. "Typically, when we talk about the future of AR and VR, the first companies that come to mind are Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOGL), Facebook (FB), and Snapchat (SNAP); however, Microsoft does not receive enough credit for the strong positioning it has already built," said Loup managing partner Gene Munster, in a blog. While virtual reality immerses a user in an imagined or replicated world such as video games, augmented reality overlays digital imagery onto the real world. Microsoft's gaming platform is key, says Munster, formerly an Apple analyst at Piper Jaffray. "Of all of the companies vying to own VR and AR platforms of the future, Microsoft is the only one to have a gaming console," he said. Digital Foundry, a gaming website, disclosed Xbox Project Scorpio specifications last week. Microsoft announced the gaming system at the Consumer Electronics Show in January. IBD'S TAKE: After a 12% gain last year, Microsoft stock is up about 5% in 2017. It has formed a flat base, with a buy point of 66.01. Learn more at IBD Stock Checkup. At CES, Microsoft said that it had reached 55 million monthly active users on its Xbox Live platform, up 15% from the previous year. In addition to VR gaming capabilities, the new Xbox will feature 4K video. Microsoft's main competition in VR gaming is Sony (SNE), says Munster. Sony released a PlayStation VR system in November. Sales reached 915,000 in late February, Sony said. "While Microsoft doesn't produce any VR hardware, it sells (Facebook's) Oculus Rift headset in its stores and has included the Xbox controller in Oculus Rift bundles," said Munster. "Oculus seems like the logical choice for a VR headset partner for Project Scorpio." Microsoft's next gaming console will also support headsets expected out in 2018 from Lenovo, Dell, Acer and HP (HPQ). Microsoft shares ended trading Monday down 0.2% to 65.53.

Apple has unleashed iOS 10.3.2 beta 2 to registered developers. The update is available over the air and from Apple’s Developer Center. However, it doesn’t appear to be available to public testers in the Apple Beta Software Program quite yet.  There’s still no word on what iOS 10.3.2 might bring with it, but because it’s an x.x.1 release, it’s likely focused on under-the-hood fixes and improvements.  Apple today also released watchOS 3.2.2 beta 2 to developers, which is also likely focused on bug fixes and other small improvements.

I'm switching to Windows By Trey Ratcliff on Apr 10, 2017, 7:00 AM 44 comments TechSpot A word about the author: Trey Ratcliff is a world-famous photographer, artist, writer and adventurer. Trey's images and stories capture the beauty of exotic travel destinations and the humor of the bizarre situations he often finds himself in. There is always something new, unexpected and beautiful to see at StuckinCustoms.com. Switching from a Mac to Windows PC I converted to Apple over 5 years ago when it was clear to me Apple made the best products for creative professionals. I loved Apple and became a hardcore fanboy. I was all-in. Now, I’m switching back to PCs. The new line of MacBook Pros are not-that-awesome. Apple has always been a company that makes beautiful, well-designed products (and still does), but they’ve started to put an emphasis on sleek design form over professional function. Why am I switching from a Mac to PC? I need a more powerful machine that can handle a LOT. I doubt I’m the only creative professional in this situation. Nowadays, my camera’s RAW files are bigger (I use a Hasselblad X1D, but my MacBook was still choking with my Sony A7Rii files), and I do a lot of video work as well. I simply need a workhorse. It’s too bad that Apple has chosen not to care so much about the creative professional; we were the ones that got them through the lean years. Oh well… Unboxing the beast Nothing better than unboxing a new toy! I also advise not using a corkscrew to unbox anything… even though I’ve probably done it over a dozen times, I haven’t improved. More reasons for the switch Windows 10 is getting really good, and Microsoft really seems to be innovating. I’m impressed and never thought I’d see the day… I thought they might just spiral down like IBM or WANG, but I’m happy they are making a come back. I’m also not an iPhone user, having switched to Android a long time ago. The new Google Pixel phone simply amazing! I’m pretty objective, and it is just a better phone all around, and it gets you out of that ridiculous closed Apple ecosystem. Even though I had a Macbook and an iPad, I always found the ecosystem to be quite confusing. iCloud will NOT stop demanding my family and I pay it more money. I never liked the Apple software apps like Mail (I use Google Inbox) or Apple Maps (I use Google Maps). While I was using Apple Photos to organize my final portfolio shots, I found it to be somewhat confusing and not as powerful as I needed it to be. Another reason is I really want to get into VR more and you need a powerful Windows machine for that. I want to do 360 art, play 360 games, and all that fun stuff. I’m a big gamer, and I like the idea of playing all those Steam games on my Windows laptop and even my tablet (I got the Surface Pro as well). How’s the switch going? Great! It hasn’t been as hard to switch to Windows 10 as I thought. Most of my woes have been around adjusting my photography workflow, but I needed to update that anyway. I was heavily reliant on a workflow where I had combined Adobe Lightroom and Apple Photos (formerly iPhoto), because I liked to keep my final portfolio in Photos. It synced nicely to my iPad and everything. Basically, I want to do everything on a big beefy laptop but also have a light tablet-like computer for more casual things. My shopping list – essentials I used to build my own PC gaming machines back in the day before I switched to Apple. I did a ton of of my own research this time around, and I remembered back in the day when I would build my own gaming PCs that I bought everything from Newegg! When I decided to switch, I called up my contacts over there to send over some of the goodies listed in this article and I’d link to them in this Switch Guide… so here we go! MSI WT72 (World’s first VR-ready mobile workstation) (I got the 17″ but maybe I should have gotten the 15″)  Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Samsung T3 Portable SSD (P.S. this thing is smaller than an iPhone!!) WD My Cloud PR2100 NAS WD My Book Pro WD My Passport Wireless Pro Bonus items Here are some other goodies I got for the Windows ecosystem: HTC Vive VR Kit Wacom Intuos Pro Pen Tablet Logitech G900 Chaos Spectrum Mouse Samsung Gear 360 Camera Here’s a strange reason to switch I’ll give you a somewhat strange reason (but not my main reason). It gives you a chance to clean all your stuff up and re-organize. It’s literally like moving into a new house. It’s a pain, but it can also be kind of fun! Also, counter-intuitively it’s good for creatives to “mix things up” from time to time and be a bit uncomfortable. I’m not going to get all philosophical here, but maybe you know what I mean. You can read more about my new storage in Step 4 below. Switching while on the go The switch from Mac to Windows is challenging enough but I also did it while on a family vacation, moving from location to location. I was actually in the middle of a 60-day photo adventure around the world with my the wife and kids and everything. Balancing all that, the photography, AND a computer OS/hardware switch was quite the Olympian feat, I must say! Trey’s guide for creative professionals to switch from Mac to Windows This guide is a bit Trey-centric because, well, I am. Although from what I can tell, I have a fairly typical setup for a photography workflow. I mostly use Adobe products, which takes away 80% of the switching pain. I’d say the other 20% is a combination of finding those “little” apps you liked so much on the Mac and finding their counterparts on Windows. Well that, and getting used to the new UI! Step 1 – Get your essential programs up and running There’s an old joke about Internet Explorer – the first thing you do with it is download Google Chrome. That joke is so old now that Internet Explorer has been replaced by “Edge,” but you can still download Chrome. Actually, I used Edge a bit and it’s pretty good. They say that it’s more optimized for Windows 10, but I can’t tell any difference yet. Here’s a list of the most important things I installed first when setting up the new machine: Adobe Creative Cloud (I installed Lightroom, Photoshop, and Premiere Pro for video) Google Chrome Spotify Evernote Dropbox (or Google Drive if you use that) Photomatix CrashPlan Note: It is recommended that you try to get the apps from their websites rather than the Windows store, where sometimes the apps can be a bit outdated or imperfect. Additional Windows software that does various things: Gramblr PhraseExpress (a keyboard shortcut program) Step 2 – Begin the copy process I used my new sleek Samsung T3 Drive and began copying all my documents to it. I tended to drag whole folders, many of which were full of other folders. Even though I was dropbox-syncing, I also moved it over manually. It sped up the process quite a bit. If you’re not that familiar with the Mac folder system, be sure to look all through the Finder window at all the core directories on the left side. I had almost everything important under /TreyRatcliff — everything should copy over fine. Here’s some notes to think about: There’s no need to copy anything under “Applications” because those apps won’t work on Windows. If you’re planning to use this as an opportunity to “clean up” or “reorganize” your Dropbox, don’t do that until you have everything 100% copied over. If you make directory changes in the middle of a sync, it gets confusing. One thing at a time. If you have native app files, like Keynote files or Numbers files, be sure to convert them to Powerpoint or Google Docs first. I highly recommend Google Docs… just get them uploaded to your Google Drive and begin that conversion. If you have some “really fancy” Keynote docs, you may want to convert to Powerpoint, but understand that you’ll have to spend some time in Powerpoint to make those presentations as “smooth” as they were in Keynote. It’s possible… but it takes a while. If you can fit your whole Adobe Lightroom directory on a single drive, then do that. Mine is over 10 TB and is on a Pegasus Thunderbolt drive. So, in my case, I connected the old Pegasus Thunderbolt drive to my MacBook along with the new WD 16TB drive via USB and I made the copy that way. I’m not sure of an “easy” or automatic way to auto-sync my Lightroom Presets and Adobe Actions. I had to go find those directories and copy over directly. To find your Lightroom Presets, go into your Lightroom Preferences and look under Presets, there you’ll see a shortcut button. Step 3 – Get signed in everywhere and start syncing This is always a bit of a small logistical pain. Luckily if you’re a Google and Facebook user, then getting logged into those first helps with the other programs you may use like Spotify and Chrome. Adobe Creative Cloud is pretty straightforward. Remember you can only have 2 active logins with Creative Cloud, which I think is stupid. But that’s how they roll there at Adobe. Anyway, you can use your new computer to log out of all the others and create two new ones. It’s not too tough. If you’re a Spotify user and like local copies of all your music, you may need to log into their website and activate/deactivate different devices. You get three there. At this point, you should have all your programs signed in and the full syncing will begin. Everything from Evernote to Dropbox to Spotify to Chrome Favorites or whatever is in your app world will start to copy over. Step 4 – The great storage adventure Note this only applies if you are not dropbox/google syncing all your files. In my case, I have 12 TB of photos, and Dropbox would take at least another administration to sync. The first thing you need to know about sharing large capacity storage between Windows and MacOS is that how the external storage is formatted makes a HUGE difference. Since Windows and MacOS can both read and write to exFAT drives, it’s good to format the drive on the Mac using exFAT. I tried doing this on the PC and the Mac could not see it. When you go into Disk Utility on the Mac, just choose exFAT to format your new drive. Easy! So what storage did I go for? The Western Digital My Cloud Pro (PR2100) NAS. A Western Digital My Book Pro and the Western Digital My Passport Wireless Pro portable drive. Starting with the My Cloud Pro, first think about how you want your storage configured. My NAS is the 16TB model and it arrived set to 2x8TB mirrored (basically 8TB of storage with the 2nd drive used to keep a separate copy of every file an automated process). I used the web interface for the NAS to re-configure the drive to show as a single 16TB volume. (HOT TIP: When you first use the NAS, update the firmware then set the web interface timeout to be as long as possible. With the default settings the login times out before you complete the drive configuration and so it has to be done again.) Optional Step 4A – Keep the Aurora HDR party going I know many people reading this love Aurora HDR 2017 which is only for the Mac. By the way, for the record, I partnered with Macphun to make this app – it’s objectively incredible! We’re working on the Windows version now, but we don’t have it yet. So, I’m reluctantly keeping my Mac around ONLY for Aurora HDR. So this requires a temporary workflow change. Here’s what I did. I made a new folder on my Dropbox called “Aurora Me” I then made a new Lightroom Export called “Aurora Me” in which I export the brackets to that folder. It auto-syncs on my Mac. I open my Mac every few days and there is a pile of 10-100 photos in there for me to AuroraHDR-ize. Easy and fun. When I export it, I go to another Dropbox folder called “Completed” that ends up back on my PC. I simply import those final versions into Lightroom for final storage. At first, I thought this would be a big pain, but it really isn’t. It’s kind of nice using my MacBook Pro for just this one simple purpose. It takes up more desk space of course, but, well, it’s not the end of the world. Plus, it’s only temporary. Step 5 – Use the Windows machine exclusively for the first week I noticed when I switched from Nikon DSLRs to the Sony mirrorless systems that it was really a difficult switch when I had both available. I knew the Nikon system so well and I would have great photo ops. For example, I was offered a cool helicopter ride up to a glacier. I was staring at my two cameras on the table, and I would usually take the Nikon because I knew the system so well and I didn’t want to risk it with the Sony. Well then one day in Sydney my Nikon broke, so all I had was the Sony. I was forced to use it for a few weeks and I ended up loving it a lot more. I was able to see how much better it was and learned all of the advantages. I’m now seeing that with Windows. Yes, learning things in the new OS are a little painful. Windows is not quite as slick as iOS in a lot of ways. I found the trackpad not quite as nice for example, and I had to re-train my brain about a few different things. But that only took a week, and now I’m pretty smooth with it! Step 6 – Get your color right By default, your new PC will have a different color profile than your Mac. At the very least you’ll have to open your color preferences and adjust the saturation until it is the same as your Mac. I recommend you pull up your 10 favorite photos and put them side by side, adjusting the saturation and color on your new PC until they are the same. Even though this system is calibrated at the factory by MSI (and has built in color profiles) this is a mistake I made and for about a week, my photos were a bit off and more de-saturated than I like. I only noticed when I looked on my wife’s mac and my photos looked less colorful than I preferred. Bonus Step 7 – Surface Pro Party with the Microsoft Surface Pro! I didn’t think I’d like this machine, but I was wrong. I like it better than my iPad for sure. It’s a fully functional computer and not just a tablet. I’ve actually been altering my workflow quite a bit where I do many “daily” things on my Surface Pro – things like email, social media, Facebook stuff, etc etc. It’s a tiny little machine that I can set on my lap or anywhere. It’s also great because I can play Steam games on it, it travels well, I can do lightweight Lightroom stuff — I have some folders synced with my big computer, etc. Bonus Step 8 – Use your Nvidia graphics card with Adobe products This wasn’t obvious and was nowhere in the documentation. But the MSI computer has a “GFX” button under the power button to the left of the keyboard. When you click that, it asks you to reboot to use the fast Nvidia card at all times. This can have performance benefits in some applications such as Lightroom which by default use the less powerful Intel GPU rather than auto switch to the Nvidia which happens when gaming. Now I just keep that Nvidia GPU on all the time (no need to reboot). On the downside, it eats up more battery, but I am connected to power most of the time. Bonus Step 9 – Virtual reality I bought the funky HTC Vive VR Kit! This has been an unexpected joy to our family. We all LOVE playing VR. There are now so many fun games and apps – the kids and wife go crazy for it. I could stay in VR Google Earth forever. At some point, I’ll put together a list of all my favorite VR Apps and Games for you! Bonus Step X – Questions?? Okay, okay, this is a living document… what did I miss? What have you discovered? And thanks for reading this far – I hope you found it helpful!

It can be downloaded by connecting the Apple TV to a computer with a USB-C cable and installing the beta software from a registered developer account using iTunes. Because of the tricky installation requirements, tvOS betas are limited to developers. tvOS 10.2.1 will not be available to the public until the final version of the software launches. Apple does not typically provide detailed beta release notes, so we don't yet know what's included in tvOS 10.2.1. It's likely to focus primarily on bug fixes, security enhancements, and performance improvements, so we may not know what's new until the software sees an official release. No notable changes were found in the first tvOS 10.2.1 beta, but should anything new popup in the second beta, we'll update this post.

The second beta of watchOS 3.2.2 can be downloaded through the Apple Watch app on the iPhone by going to General --> Software Update. To install the update, the Apple Watch must have 50 percent battery, it must be placed on the charger, and it must be in range of the iPhone. watchOS betas require an iPhone running iOS 10 to install, and they're only available to developers because there's no way to downgrade the software on an Apple Watch. It's not yet clear if watchOS 3.2.2 introduces any new features or bug fixes because Apple doesn't typically provide release notes for betas. Given that this is a minor 3.x.x update, it's likely to focus primarily on bug fixes. No notable features were found in the first watchOS 3.2.2 update, but we'll update this post should anything new be discovered.

Andrew Tonner (TMFTheDude) Apr 10, 2017 at 1:31PM Tech giants Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) are, without a doubt, the two best income investments among mobile device makers. This might come as something of a surprise, though. According to researcher IDC, Apple and Samsung combine to produce only about one-third of all smartphone shipments as of Q3 2016. However, thanks to their highly profitable handset franchises, Apple and Samsung capture a far greater share of the mobile device industry's operating profits. In this article, we'll delve deeper into exactly why Apple and Samsung are the best dividend stocks to own in the mobile device market. Apple The corporate world's largest and richest company, Apple mints tens of billions of dollars each quarter from sales of its popular iPhone. In fact, Apple's iPhone is so popular that the company regularly captures the vast majority of smartphone industry profits each quarter, with Samsung typically collecting the remaining profits. Most other handset OEMs operate at, or near, breakeven. Apple's cash hoard is also well known, at this point. The Mac maker carried $246 billion in cash and investments on its balance sheet as of its most recent quarterly report, roughly $230 billion of which currently resides overseas due to repatriation tax consequences. Crucially, the company currently has just $49 billion -- a dollar figure that could seem tiny for a company of Apple's scale -- remaining on its current capital-return program. It seems relatively safe to assume that Apple will allocate further funds for dividends and share repurchases this year, particularly given the coming earnings boon that seems likely with the release of the iPhone 8 this fall. So while Apple's current 1.6% dividend yield might seem underwhelming relative to the S&P 500's 1.9% yield, Apple's insane profitability makes it my top pick for long-term dividend investors in the mobile-devices space. Image Source: Samsung Samsung Though not as profitable as Apple, Korean tech giant Samsung also deserves investors' consideration for its income-producing prowess. The yin to Apple's yang in today's current smartphone duopoly, Samsung stands as the second most profitable company in this increasingly mature space. At the same time, Samsung's broadly diversified revenue base -- organized around three massive lines of businesses -- should help derisk the company's ability to issue cash payments to investors, even as the global technology landscape evolves in the coming years. Samsung's dividend currently yields just 1.6%. That's not too exciting, at least on the surface. However, the evidence suggests that Samsung will raise its dividend appreciatively in the year ahead. In recent years, the company came under pressure from activist hedge fund Elliott Management, which initially proposed splitting Samsung into two separate entities. To placate this unease, Samsung said it will distribute roughly 50% of its free cash flow via dividends. And though I can't find free cash flow growth estimates for Samsung, sell-side analysts' top-line and bottom-line estimates should serve as something of a useful guide to help frame expectations about free cash flow in the year ahead.  Metric 2016 2017   Percentage Change   Sales  206,129  225,035  9.2% Earnings per share (EPS)  134,971  232,378  72.2% Data Source: Reuters. Sales and EPS figures in trillions of Korean won. Of course, neither estimate alone will be perfectly predictive of Samsung's free cash flow growth this year, although the positive trend seems fairly obvious. Lavishing dividends on current shareholders could also prove good politics for Samsung, given its current leadership uncertainty. Samsung CEO Jay Lee has been embroiled in the current corruption scandal that has rocked the South Korean political establishment. In fact, last month, a South Korean court ordered the arrest of Jay Lee on charges including "bribery, embezzlement, hiding assets overseas and perjury," according to Reuters. Given Samsung's massive size and deep bench of talented managers, the company's financial performance shouldn't be derailed due to the negative publicity -- case in point, the above growth estimates. However, this case does bring an ugly black cloud over the entire company, which is why an aggressive dividend policy could help shore up investor confidence for the consumer electronics giant.

Apple has also released a minor iOS 10.3.1 update, which focused on security improvements. Registered developers can download the second iOS 10.3.2 beta from the Apple Developer Center or over-the-air with the proper configuration profile installed. We don't yet know what features or improvements are coming in iOS 10.3.2 as Apple doesn't offer detailed release notes and nothing notable was discovered in the first iOS 10.3.2 update. As a minor 10.x.x update, we can expect iOS 10.3.2 to offer bug fixes and performance improvements rather than outward-facing features. Apple has said that the update fixes SiriKit car commands, which should be working as expected. If we find anything new in the second iOS 10.3.2 beta, we'll update this post.

According to the release notes accompanying the beta, the update "improves the stability, compatibility, and security of your Mac." Because Apple's release notes don't often provide much insight into what's included in new beta software, we don't yet know what features or bug fixes might be included in 10.12.5. Nothing notable was discovered in the first beta, but should new features be discovered in the second macOS Sierra 10.12.5 beta, we'll update this post.

Rating: 11 Votes cult hero 13 hours ago at 10:43 am 10.12.4 was a big deal for me. A lot of issues I've had with the Touch Bar and Thunderbolt 3 appears to have gone away. I had griped that the 2016 MBP was the most unstable Mac I have owned since the switch to Intel (that was pretty bumpy early on) each new release of Sierra, 10.12.4 in particular, has improved things. * No more randomly vanishing portions of the Touch Bar. (I was starting to think I had bad hardware.) * No more sleep/way system crashes while connected to Thunderbolt 2 or 3 devices. * Far less application crashing. As others have stated, I wish they would be more detailed in their release notes.

Exactly, we don't need any security info but they need to be more transparent on what the specific fixes would be. I mean Apple fixing a bug or glitch is a good thing why hide it under a general broad statement, be more specific and transparent.

It also taps into Spotify. For over a decade, Algoriddim developed exclusively for Apple devices. It even won Apple's coveted Design Award in 2016 and previously took an Apple Store Best Of award. But when the company's VP of Product, Michael Simmons, first saw the Microsoft Surface Studio and Surface Dial, he thought it would be a great fit for the company's djay Pro software. He was right. "This is the best platform we've ever developed djay for," he tells PCMag. Windows Bridge for iOS enabled Algoriddim to take its Objective C code for the Apple devices and bring it into Visual Studio. There, the Bridge translates iOS APIs to Windows 10 Universal Windows Platform-compatible code, letting a developer reuse about 80 percent of the Apple code in order to create an equivalent Windows 10 app. The result isn't a simple port of the iOS app; rather, it uses native Windows 10 interface elements and capabilities. Bridge is all open source code, so it's not like Microsoft can unilaterally control it. "Windows has been our No. 1 platform request," Simmons said, and the Bridge made the task easier than building a new app from the ground up. But not everyone has the huge music library of a pro DJ. Spotify does, so djay Pro can hook into a Spotify Premium account, for a nearly unlimited selection of tunes to mix and scratch. With this release, you can only use one Surface Dial, but Simmons admitted that using multiple Dials would be a plus. They retail for $99.99, which isn't much in terms of pro music equipment. Simmons told me djay Pro is the first developer to create an app with "zone awareness" for the Dial, meaning that its function changes depending on where you place it on the screen. For example, the Dial defaults as a cross fader control, but if you put it over one of the virtual turntables, you can scratch on that. If you put it over the tempo indicator, you can speed up or slow down the music's tempo. The Dial also works if it's not on the screen—that's just another zone. When on a Surface Book or Surface Pro, you don't get this zone awareness, but you can still use the Dial. You can set it to do things like changing the volume or to add an effect such as flange. If the Dial isn't enough physical control for you, the app has plug-and-play support for over 50 standard MIDI controllers. And in the other direction, you could simply forgo external hardware and use the PC's touch screen to work all the apps many controls and effects. The app doesn't merely let you queue and mix four tracks, but it can sync up both their tempi and their key signatures. The Dial also lets you simply scroll through your song library, which can include not only Spotify tracks, but locally stored music files, iTunes library tunes, and Windows Media Player library. It doesn't yet support the Microsoft Groove on-demand music service or SoundCloud. The Munich-based company may have top international DJs—including David Guetta and Armin van Buuren—as "Software Ambassadors," but its software is just as well-suited for kids learning about music. "The mission of Algoriddim was to make everyone a DJ or to be inspired by music," said Simmons. For now, the Windows 10 app lacks the Mac version's video-mixing capabilities, but Simmons said that was on the product roadmap. Even without that, the $49.99 djay Pro app (discounted at launch), is a joy to make music with, and even more so if you're lucky enough to use it on a Surface Studio.

Sony A6500 macOS Sierra 10.12.5 beta is currently only available to developers. Public beta versions usually come a few days after developer versions if not the same day. The upcoming update follows macOS 10.12.4 which brought Apple’s color shifting Night Shift feature to the Mac for the first time. Apple is also running developer betas for iOS 10.3.2, watchOS 3.2.2, and tvOS 10.2.1. The version number and lack of release notes so far suggests this will be a minor update focused on bug fixes and security improvements ahead of macOS 10.13 later this year. We’ll update with any new features found in macOS 10.12.5. Apple will likely unveil the next major update, macOS 10.13, at WWDC 2017 on June 5th.

The company previously held the top position each year since the study debuted in 2010. While unfortunate, the drop is not unexpected as Apple has faced considerable backlash over its new MacBook Pro. To pick the winners, losers and also-rans, we evaluated the 10 biggest laptop brands to determine which offer the best combination of quality products, cutting-edge innovation, helpful support, sleek designs and strong value. Because of its modest review scores, expensive products and lack of ports, Apple fell all the way down to fifth place after receiving top honors every year since the Best and Worst Brands debuted in 2010. Each company was assigned a score based on a 100-point scale. Points are awarded in six different categories: Design, Reviews, Tech Support, Warranty, Innovation and Value and Selection.

There are much better offerings on the market with much better specs at a much lower price. I think the newer generation of laptop owners are finally using their head and spending money wisely. Nowadays people want more for their money and not just pay extra for a certain brand-name that offers less.

We'll see. Andrew Cunningham - Apr 10, 2017 5:00 pm UTC Enlarge / Apple's Phil Schiller takes the wraps off the new Mac Pro at WWDC in 2013. Apple reader comments 189 Share this story Last week, Apple did something it never does—it spoke to journalists and pundits on the record about a product that was so far from being released that the company didn't even have prototypes to show off. Further ReadingExplaining the battery life problems with the new MacBook Pros That's the state of the Mac desktop right now. After the October 2016 product came and went with no mention of the rumored desktops, complaints and anxiety about the state of Apple’s high-end computers reached a fever pitch (my barometer for this sort of thing is what John Siracusa, Marco Arment, and a handful of developers I follow say on their podcasts and Twitter feeds, which is highly unscientific, but I don't think that makes it inaccurate). Apple appeared to be pulling out of the external display business, and its new pro laptops offered less RAM and had worse battery life than some people were happy with. It had been a year since the iMac got an update, two years since the Mac Mini was updated, and more than three years since we heard a single peep about the Mac Pro. In an internal memo a couple of months later, CEO Tim Cook said the company had “great desktops in his roadmap,” but that’s the stock boilerplate response to any questions about future products. Credible reports around the same time that suggested Apple had de-emphasized and slowed down Mac development internally only added fuel to the fire. So, the unusual amount of uncertainty about desktops prompted an unusual response: a sit-down conversation about products that won’t be announced or released until later this year or next (or possibly even later than that). Apple declined to get very specific about its plans, but let’s sift through some tea leaves and suss out some possible directions that Apple’s desktops could take from here. The Mac Pro, and admitting your mistakes Enlarge / The "thermal core" concept the 2013 Mac Pro was designed around ended up being insufficiently flexible for future upgrades. Apple When Phil “can’t-innovate-my-ass” Schiller unveiled that new Mac Pro in mid-2013, surely the plan was not to let it sit and rot for three years before pledging to replace it with something completely different. At the time, Schiller said that Apple had wanted to build a new Mac Pro design that would last for "another ten years." But that’s not what happened, and Apple is willing to admit that it was because of engineering problems based on a poor prediction of where high-end computing was headed. From Craig Federighi: “I think we designed ourselves into a bit of a thermal corner, if you will. We designed a system that we thought with the kind of GPUs that at the time we thought we needed, and that we thought we could well serve with a two GPU architecture… that that was the thermal limit we needed, or the thermal capacity we needed. But workloads didn’t materialize to fit that as broadly as we hoped. Being able to put larger single GPUs required a different system architecture and more thermal capacity than that system was designed to accommodate. So it became fairly difficult to adjust.” Specifically, the way the 2013 Pro was designed, each of the three boards on the inside (one with a CPU, two with dedicated GPUs) were meant to have roughly similar heat output and cooling needs. If you were to throw that balance off—by adding, say, a single more powerful GPU instead of two midrange ones—the fan wouldn’t be able to cool it off well enough. Further ReadingApple is completely redesigning the Mac Pro… again The design assumed that GPU compute via APIs like OpenCL and Metal would be transformative, and it even defined APIs within macOS to make it possible to dedicate a single GPU solely to either OpenCL or OpenGL. Certainly, there are workloads for which that sort of thing is useful, but GPUs haven’t removed the need for fast multi-core CPUs. This is especially true of software developers, an audience Apple says is rapidly growing. The 2013 Mac Pro was a one-size-fits-all mini computer that replaced a hulking but enormously flexible PC tower. The older Mac Pro towers could accept multiple high-end GPUs, they had two CPU sockets, they had a bunch of internal drive bays, they had internal PCI Express expansion slots. Thunderbolt can replace some of that with external drive caddies and other accessories, but it can’t let you fundamentally alter the system’s performance the way more CPU and GPU horsepower can (and Thunderbolt accessories are habitually rarer and more expensive than their standardized internal counterparts). Apple acknowledges all of this. Read a transcript of the interview, and it’s clear that the company understands the key shortcomings of the trashcan Mac Pro design. Pros have many, many different needs. Pros need regular, consistent updates. Pros need modularity and flexibility and expandability. Imagining what a new Mac Pro looks like The new Mac Pro is one-eighth the volume of the old one, but it comes at a high price for pros. Apple Check out the inside of this thing: four 3.5-inch drive bays, room for two CPUs and eight sticks of RAM, and lots of expansion slots. There's... not much space inside the 2013 Pro. Surely we can find a happy medium. iFixit We won’t see this new Mac Pro until at least next year, and computing still moves quickly enough that it’s hard to predict exactly what Apple is going to settle on. But looking at what Apple acknowledged about the old Mac Pro design alongside its goals for the new one allows you to make some educated guesses. Let’s assume, for the sake of argument, that Apple is still going to want to build something relatively small and unobtrusive, because this is Apple we’re talking about. There’s a whole bunch of space in the old cheese grater-style Mac Pro that could be saved if you were trying to modernize it: start by removing the 5.25-inch optical drive bays and also the internal 3.5-inch drive bays, both of which can easily be replaced by external USB or Thunderbolt or network-attached accessories. The small SSD cards that Apple already uses in the 2013 Mac Pros also save you from needing any internal storage bays; just make a little room on the motherboard (some PC motherboards even tuck the M.2 SSD slot away on the back of the board to save space on the front). Further ReadingIntel’s new Broadwell Xeon server CPUs offer up to 22 cores per socket On the same note, I’d also bet against Apple including multiple processor sockets. This is both because of the amount of extra cooling and board space these configurations need (another socket plus four more RAM slots), and because technological advancements have made this less necessary than it was in the old days. The old dual-socket Mac Pros maxed out at 12 cores, or two CPUs with six cores apiece. By the time the 2013 Mac Pro had come out, Intel offered a single-socket CPU with 12 cores. Now Intel offers as many as 22 cores in a single CPU within a similar TDP; next-generation Xeons are said to be bumping that up to 28 or even 32. Those processors cost many pretty pennies, but the Mac Pro is hardly the most frugal of desktop computers. The same thing is true of RAM slots, more or less. If you were using two processors, the old Mac Pro could handle up to 128GB using third-party RAM modules; the 2013 Mac Pro can do the same with four slots, and any new Mac Pro would likely be able to do at least that well depending on what CPU support and memory density looks like when it’s released. GPUs are perhaps the biggest wildcard. Based on all of Apple’s talk about its dual-GPU system being the wrong move, I’d say the new Mac Pro will have the space and the cooling to accommodate at least one top-end 250W GPU. The question is whether Apple would use a proprietary card design like it does in the 2013 Mac Pro, or if it would return to using standard PCI Express cards. The former is more flexible but the latter requires less development work on Apple’s part, which I’d say is a plus if I was trying to keep a high-end computer up to date to satisfy a fraction of a fraction of my userbase. On the Accidental Tech Podcast, John Siracusa suggests that Apple could use standard PCI Express cards with custom cooling apparatuses installed, which seems like a good compromise. Even if it does use standard GPUs, I wouldn’t hold my breath for much more internal expandability. Adding things like NICs and storage capacity is a place where Thunderbolt excels, and I’d guess that Thunderbolt 3’s wider adoption in the rest of the PC industry will lead to a more diverse, competitive accessory ecosystem. Adding, say, 10 gigabit Ethernet to a 2013 Mac Pro via Thunderbolt costs a few hundred bucks, while adding it via PCI Express can be done for less than half that price. If you can close that gap, lack of internal expandability for peripherals won’t be such a huge deal. Put all of this stuff—one CPU socket that can scale from 4 to over 20 cores, four RAM slots, a top-end GPU, a fast SSD card, and plenty of Thunderbolt 3 ports for additional expansion—inside a relatively small, sleek case, and then make it pretty easy for users to open up and work on themselves, and you’ve got a Mac Pro that should serve a wider base of users than the 2013 model while still keeping people who liked that model’s size and unobtrusiveness reasonably happy. Apple could choose to go another way—it could definitely choose to make a larger, more expandable system than I’m assuming here—and none of my calculus takes bleeding-edge technology like DDR5 or Intel’s Optane into account. But if the old Mac Pro was designed to be as flexible as possible and the 2013 Mac Pro was engineered in part to make a statement about innovation at Apple, a computer like this could find a way to do both.

That means apps that haven’t been updated with 64-bit support won’t run at all even though current iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch processors still support both 32-bit and 64-bit code. iOS 10 warns that 32-bit apps won’t run on future system versions Troughton-Smith isn’t saying who is giving him this information, but he says the message is clear. In a post on Twitter he said, “I’m hearing very clearly iOS 11 won’t have 32bit app support at all.” Devs: I’m hearing very clearly iOS 11 won’t have 32bit app support at all. Update legacy apps now if you want them to survive past September — Steve T-S (@stroughtonsmith) April 8, 2017 He goes on to say the message he’s getting is that future A-series processors—Apple’s custom processors for the iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch—won’t include 32-bit support. If that’s true, Apple may be simplifying its chip design, or at least freeing up space so the they can be smaller or include other features. Even though Apple hasn’t officially confirmed what Troughton-Smith is saying, there’s a good chance his sources are right. Apple has been giving users on-screen warnings when they launch 32-bit apps ever since iOS 9 and those started sounding more ominous in iOS 10. Those warnings state, “This app will not work with future versions of iOS,” although they don’t specify which future iOS version. Apple Puts 32-bit Apps On Notice Apple also started cleaning house, so to speak, on the App Store last year. Outdated and abandoned apps are being removed, which is probably part of the comany’s prep work for dropping 32-bit app support. For iOS device users, that means any legacy apps that haven’t been updated to include 64-bit support will stop working after they update to iOS 11. If if doesn’t look like the developer has any plans to make their app 64-bit, it’s time to start looking for a replacement. You can see which apps on your iOS device don’t have a 64-bit update available in Settings. Check out our Quick Tip to learn how. Apple usually shows off features in the upcoming versions of iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS at its annual Worldwide Developer Conference. This year the even is in June, so odds are that’s when we’ll find out for sure if 32-bit support is gone in iOS 11.

Read the latest rumours on the 2017 iMac specification, price and UK launch date. New iMacs surely must be coming soon, but will they have Intel or AMD processors? By Marie Brewis | 10 Apr 17 Now that Intel has launched its Kaby Lake processors (rumoured to be the most likely choice of processor in upcoming Apple iMacs) and AMD has released its new Ryzen 7 chips (the outside bet as the more power-efficient of the two), the countdown is on for new iMacs to launch in the UK. But apparently for everyone except Apple. Also see: New MacBook Pro  On 21 March 2017 the Apple Store went down for 'maintenance' and reappeared at midday with a slew of new products of the iOS variety - new iPad and iPhone options, but no new Mac products. Though we had been expecting a proper Spring Event, as Apple has provided in recent years, this time around the product announcements came without the fanfare. (And without the iMacs.) So when can we expect new Apple all-in-ones? According to Apple, new iMacs will be released later this year. Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing Phil Schiller said at a roundtable event with a few journalists at its headquarters in Cupertino that these new iMacs may even appeal to previous Mac Pro users. If you are viewing a mobile version of this page click here to view the latest version of this story. When is the 2017 iMac release date? New iMac UK release date: September 2017 (TBC)  This is becoming a theme. In October 2016 Apple was expected to announce new iMacs at a special event. It did not. In March 2017 Apple was expected to announce new iMacs at a special event. It did not. So what's going on? The reality is Apple won't hold another event until June 2017, but this is its WWDC developers conference, and it is unlikely we will see any new Macs here. There should be product announcements in September and October 2017, so it's possible that updated iMacs could appear then. Apple has confirmed that they will be arriving this year. There's little reason to wait so long, though, given that Intel's Kaby Lake processors were announced at CES in January, and more recently have been followed by the more power-efficient AMD Ryzen chips. We'd expect to see the S-Series desktop chips (Core i5-7500 / Core i5-7600 / Core i7-7700K) in the 27in iMac, although there is no clear upgrade path for the 21.5in iMac. The future of the iMac is beginning to look a little uncertain, but there's no need to worry just yet. Apple CEO Tim Cook has stated on an internal Q&A session that "Some folks in the media have raised the question about whether we're committed to desktops. If there's any doubt about that with our teams, let me be very clear: we have great desktops in our roadmap. Nobody should worry about that." How much will the 2017 iMac cost in the UK?  According to a Best Buy leak, which may or may not be accurate, a 27in iMac with 32GB of RAM and a 2TB Fusion Drive will cost $3,199.99. This appears to be slightly higher than the current 27in iMac with 32GB RAM and a 2TB Fusion Drive, though of course we don’t know exactly what other upgrades this model includes (and whether or not it is merely placeholder text).  Over in the UK the current 21.5in iMac starts at £899 or £1,199 with a 4K display, while the 27in 5K model starts at £1,449, both direct from Apple. We would expect prices to remain roughly the same.  What are the rumoured specifications?  Following that Best Buy leak, it’s highly likely the new iMac will feature a processor upgrade to Intel’s latest Kaby Lake family, with one blog claiming it'll feature an Intel E3-1285 v6 processor. The Best Buy listing also mentioned a 27in 5K display, 32GB of memory and a 2TB Fusion Drive, with the model priced at $3,199.99. It could be placeholder copy, but why bother to update the processor? We’d really like to see this Fusion Drive rolled out as standard across the range.  Apple could well turn to AMD once again for its graphics solution, with Polaris 10 a prime candidate. It offers improved graphics performance (naturally), plus potential reductions in power consumption and waste heat. More exciting, though, is that these new graphics chips would for the first time bring VR potential to the Mac. This is also backed up by Pike's Universum which claims that it'll feature AMD graphics to support VR and Pro users/apps. We’ve seen Apple bring the Pro name to its iPad line-up over the past year, and one rumour circulating online is that the iMac will also get Pro treatment - we could be about to see a sufficiently powerful iMac Pro to replace the Mac Pro.  It is thought that when the new iMac arrives its keyboard will feature the same Touchbar as is found on the most recent revision to the MacBook Pro. Recent patent applications reveal a keyboard with adaptive input row, described by Apple thus: “The adaptive input row may be positioned within an opening of a device and include a cover for receiving a touch and a display that is configured to present an adaptable set of indicia. The adaptive input row may also include one or more sensors for detecting the location of a touch and/or the magnitude of a force of the touch. The adaptive input row may be positioned adjacent or proximate to a keyboard of the electronic device.” The new iMac coming later this year is also expected to feature fast Intel Optane memory and storage.

However, the messaging isn’t without caveats as power users who find themselves outgrowing their purchases year after year may have to part with their purchases, rather than being offered a solution to upgrade internals, such as memory (RAM), storage, or add other components, such as graphics card or CPU. The idea for ‘disposable computing’ where users shed their old devices and get new ones stem from Apple’s success in mobile. In the iPod era, the only way to get a larger capacity iPod was the buy a new one as you outgrew the storage of the current model. iPod devices were sleek and did not come with replaceable batteries nor removable memory cards. In the age of the iPhone, Apple created an even tighter ecosystem where you’d have to not only buy your apps through the singular gatekeeper–the App Store–but all components were sealed and not upgradeable. For the iPhone 5, for instance, choose an AT&T iPhone 5 with 16 GB and later decide you want to switch to Verizon and get 32 GB of capacity? Tough–you have to buy a whole new phone. And lastly in the post-PC era of the iPad, you have the same constraints with the iPhone. Worse, the iPad is sold to many as a computing device, and not as a secondary tablet, meaning that this is the only access to a ‘computer’ that some users would have at home. No upgradeable processors or graphics, no serviceable RAM, no expandable memory, and no replaceable battery. The iPad is a one-shot computer and when you outgrow its potential, you’ll have to buy a whole new one as third-generation iPad owners who are eyeing the fourth generation model are having to decide right now. And the lessons learned in mobile are extending to traditional PC era computing as well. MacBook Air and Retina MacBook notebooks are not serviceable with soldered RAM and non-removable batteries. Most recently, the impossibly thin desktop-class iMac computer is said to feature non-upgradeable components, meaning that based on the configuration of the desktop at the point of purchase, you’re stuck with whatever you decide until you decide to buy a new computer. Is this quest for beauty and form worth the sacrifice? Fortunately, for the environment, at least Apple is going green. As Apple perfects its designs, consumers are now forced into a ritualistic upgrade cycle where they have to buy completely new hardware. iPhone users know that after a couple generations on the same model when iOS support becomes dropped for older hardware and apps require newer graphics and processors to run, users have to upgrade. But upgrading in mobile is easier, at least in the U.S., since users generally have two-year contracts and are offered subsidies on qualified upgrades. On the notebooks and desktops where consumers have to spend between $1,000 and $3,000 up front out of pocket, Apple is asking a lot from its customers. 8 Responses 10/25/2012 Tim Davies Reply Here’s the thing. You should not be buying the latest computer…because it’s the latest. You should be buying the computer that fits your needs. Do you need that fastest processor available because you do a lot of encoding and time is money? ok then, perhaps it’s worth the extra $150 to get the faster processor because that extra 3 minutes of encoding time will add up to saving in money over a few months or years. Do you need more ram because you need to be able to do that encoding in the background, while doing other work? If so, check. But, are you using this computer just for fun. Is it, would be nice, or is it smart? Lastly, the computer you bought last year does the same thing it did last year. Have your needs in a computer changed since then? would you save money in your work, or be more productive with the new hardware to make up the lost cash in upgrading. Things to consider. 04/20/2016 Darknerd Reply Tim Davis: Here’s the thing, no warranty, no support. Perhaps coincidence, the computer often has failing parts around the time the extended warranty w/ Apple Care expires. So it’s a risk or luck of the draw. Also, Apple has a tendency of testing the latest OS with current models, and quickly OS a few years back to end-of-life, even if they are not officially end-of-life, the previous OSes get little love or concern from Apple. So essentially, tested on the latest and greatest, everything else, who cares is the attitude from Apple. Find a bug? Solution: Buy a New Mac. And the Genius bar can swap out hardware or google solutions for you if existing bugs. Apple doesn’t really care. And in the market, there’s no real alternative niche in the market that Mac OS X solves well. 10/25/2012 sfwrtr Reply You are forgetting hand-me-down computing. I have a network of friends and family who are plenty happy with last year’s model, or the computer iteration I bought 3 years ago. I do miss being able to upgrade a PC, but frankly, how often did we do that? Usually, it was a whole new machine… 10/25/2012 Best iphone5 Case Reply The Disposable Computer is really the need of the hour . Others vendors should follow this line 08/12/2013 UC Browser PC Reply yes this is very long trend which is followed by Apple! 12/30/2013 True husk Reply I don’t think this will however increase the quality. I don’t see a good reason why Apple should implement this. Android is now surpassing them and people are ditching their devices. I won’t be happy if I’m starting to see Apple re-using materials. 01/10/2014 dns 2222 Reply Yes apple is progressing very fast in this market. 04/10/2017 Dalmar Reply In the community of Front-End development, Graphic Design and Programming the typical end user purposely will sort and earlier Mac for the simple fact that it is upgradeable to an extent. Upgradeable Mac-minis are also in demand. I recall walking into an independent Apple vendor out west in 2008. The majority of the people in the store were there for repairs and some had the non-intel Macs. I couldn’t imagine that today. Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

Increase / Decrease text size Ellie Burns   - Editor 10th April 2017 Add to favorites Does your business need a chatbot? Chatbots have recently burst onto the tech market with everyone from Google and Apple, to Facebook and Apple, embracing the smart tech. It seems the rush is on to be the next in line to release a chatbot – but is this type of bot right for all businesses? What are the pitfalls and challenges of deploying such a technology. To answer those questions and more, CBR’s Ellie Burns sat down with John Heald, Global VP at SAP Hybris, to talk human to human about this tech trying to muscle in on conversation.   EB: First of all let’s pin down what chatbots actually are – so, what exaclty is a chatbot? John Heald, Global VP, SAP Hybris JH: A chatbot is probably the widest use of “bots” (short for robot) in the market today. Bots are software solutions that operate as an agent for a user, another software program, or simulates a human activity. Chatbots are a specific manifestation of bots and have seen a recent spike in interest due to the rapidly progressing maturity of natural language processing and the ubiquity of mobile devices. The growth of Siri, Alexa, Cortana and Google Assistant have put chatbots in the limelight, accelerating their acceptance as an appropriate channel. Furthermore, the rise in popularity of messaging platforms such as Slack and WeChat highlight the value of chat-based communication, and not just amongst humans themselves but also between humans and systems. Chatbots have demonstrated their value in dealing with repetitive e-commerce tasks, retrieving team updates and customer service inquiries, all by primarily using messaging as conversational interface.   EB: What are the most appropriate tasks for chatbots? JH: The vast majority of customers currently don’t trust chatbots to run intelligent deductions or understand complex interactions. These perceptions mean that the interaction between customers and chatbots will remain very basic, in the short term, until they are proven to add significant business value. They are typically being used as a consumer facing solution for repetitive, mundane tasks. However, as these automations become more intelligent through machine learning to better resolve customer issues, the use cases will expand beyond the current mundane tasks such as: Can I reset my password? Can I create or update my ticket?   EB: Do you have any real world examples of when a chatbot was used poorly? JH: I had a recent dealing with a telecoms provider and I wanted to look into an issue with my account. I engaged with a chatbot but the result was less than desired as it kept going through the same resolution and spitting out repetitive responses. Simply, if the chatbot isn’t learning from its interactions then it’s a waste of effort and will ultimately create more issues and escalations than it will solve – and potentially be detrimental to customer satisfaction.   EB: What do organisations need to consider when thinking about implementing chatbots? JH: When an organisation decides to introduce a chatbot, it’s advisable to start focused. Task the chatbot with a relatively controlled objective, for example reducing agent wait time by providing a customer with guidance on how to find the serial number of their appliance and not keep the agent on hold. However, just because you’ve deployed a chatbot, the work doesn’t end there. You need to be thinking about what the next steps are and how to constantly improve the service. Think about how the chatbot can take on new challenges and evolve, as that’s when it will deliver real business value. Organisations can’t get complacent, they need to expand to keep pace with the ever-changing demands and expectations of customers and prospects. They will quickly discover that the benefits of deployment are numerous, from providing intelligent service at scale and reducing organisational support costs to delivering a positive experiences for users. John spoke to CBR as part of our on-going Tech Express series. Bots are improving the omnichannel customer journey through a combination of machine learning and intelligence which is underpinning their success. As customers move more fluidly between channels, chatbots will become a key piece of a larger omnichannel strategy.   EB: Which industry is blazing the trail when it comes to chatbot best practice? JH: The industries currently reaping the greatest benefits of chatbots, are those where there are economies of scale, based on the volume of data, namely consumer orientated industries. Currently most use cases are for industries that tend to be at the front end of technology curves, as they have the most to benefit. They also have the scale and repetitive tasks which chatbots can take over. For example, telco network providers (some making better use than others) are using chatbots to inform customers when they’re due for an upgrade or utilities using them to register meter readings, as well as some restaurants using them to help with customer orders.

The firm is still expected to unveil the handset, which some claim will be called the iPhone Edition, at a September event, and to let customers preorder it. However, delivery is not expected until 'several weeks' later due to the ambitious technology in the handset, according to longtime Apple analyst Brian White. Scroll down for video   Apple has released an iPhone in Sept for the past 5 years, but a report has suggested that the firm could soon break tradition. A paper has stated that the iPhone 8 (artist impression) could debut in October or November - citing the challenges of designing a 'radical new iPhone' An excerpt from White's research note with investment banking firm Drexel Hamilton, obtained by Macrumours, claims 'Our contact strongly believes the 5.8-inch iPhone 8 will be delayed by several weeks due to challenges around the 3D sensing technology, but still in time for the December holidays.  'This is not the first time that we've heard about a potential delay with a new iPhone; however, our contact was so emphatic about the delay that we are taking this data point more seriously.'  According to White,  customers will be able to pre-order the new 5.8-inch iPhone 8 along with the new 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch iPhones in September; however, the 5.8-inch iPhone 8 will not be available for delivery until several weeks later.  It is believed that 'technical issues' are the culprit, as suppliers have struggled with the lamination process of the curved OLED panels and adoption of the 3D sensing front-camera technology.   Rumors surrounding the iPhone 8 began sweeping the web just a few months after Apple released the iPhone 7 line. And although the iPhone 7 sold out in a week, many saw it as nothing more than a refreshed iPhone 6 – which has put some pressure on Apple to impress its users.

Share this article Share 11 shares But with all the cutting-edge technology that is expected to be in the iPhone 8 design, many suggest that the Cupertino company is pulling out all the stops for the iPhone 8 family. However, it seems that the new technology may push back the launch date. The news was first revealed by Economic Daily News (via Digitimes), which suggested Apple has yet to iron out all of the kinks in its highly-anticipated smartphone, reported 9to5Mac. IPHONE 8 RUMORS   Several rumors have been circulating about the iPhone 8, and suggest the next device may have:  - Dual-lens 3D camera  - Augmented reality to generate real-time views of surroundings  - Curved glass casing - Plastic OLED screen  - Wireless charging  - A folding element  - New 5 inch (12.7 centimeter) and 5.8 inch (14.7 centimeter) model, which will have a wraparound OLED screen  - 5.8 inch will be designed with the Touch ID finger print sensor 'under the glass and in the active display area'  - A new 'pure white' model  - Aluminum back will be replaced with two reinforced glass panes and a metal frame in the middle  - Facial recognition -Premium model will cost $1,000  A report from March revealed that the Cupertino firm would not start mass production of the so-called iPhone 8 (artist impression) until September. This was believed to be a result of Apple's custom fingerprint sensor that is set to replace the TouchID 'Technical issues related to the lamination process of curved OLED panels, and the adoption of a 3D sensing system may cause the delay of the new iPhone devices,' said the paper. However, Apple has experienced manufacturing issues in the past, so has many other phone makers, but 9to5Mac has shared supporting evidence that suggests this time might be the real deal. A report from March revealed that the Cupertino firm would not start mass production of the so-called iPhone 8 until September. Another clue suggesting the timeline is real is that Foxconn, a Taiwanese multinational electronics contract manufacturing company, has not shared as many leaks as it normally does around this time of year (artist impression) This was believed to be a result of Apple's custom fingerprint sensor that is set to replace the TouchID – the firm is believed to be building its own system and needed more time for manufacturing. It was suggested that Apple has passed over both the Synaptic's Natural ID touch fingerprint sensor and Qualcomm's Sense ID for the iPhone. It is, however, going with its own technology for a fingerprint recognition solution – Authentec algorithm combined with Privaris glass identification technology. 'Apple's in-house developed fingerprint ID solution will be fabricated at TSMC's 12-inch line using 65nm process technology, sources told DigitTimes in a March interview. The sources also said the move would push production for the OLED iPhone back until September, which means the handset will not go on sale until October. Another clue is that, according to 9to5Mac, Foxconn, a Taiwanese multinational electronics contract manufacturing company, has not shared as many leaks as it normally does around this time of year. LARGER BATTERY  Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities has revealed that Apple plans to put a larger battery in the 4.7-inch iPhone 8.  Kuo explained that it will be designed with a 2,700 mAh battery - putting its battery capacity on par with the iPhone 7 Plus.  Another feature rumored to appear in Apple's next iPhone is a larger 'L' shaped battery (middle', which would put battery capacity on par with the iPhone 7 Plus Will use a 'substrate-like PCB mainboard', which will allow the firm to implement an OLED display in the flagship handset.  The new components are believed to be much more expensive in anything used in an iPhone before, which could increase manufacturing costs by 80 percent.  However, it was revealed last week that iOS users should expect to pay a hefty price tag for their next iPhone. 'By April, we normally see a flood of next-gen iPhone cases, schematics leak and blurry photos from the factory floor,' Benjamin Mayo with 9to5Mac wrote. 'This is yet to happen for iPhone 8.' 'Either Apple has tightened security to improve secrecy … or the devices are yet to be produced in mass quantities.' However, it is also believed that Apple will still go on with the event it holds every September, where it could just unveil the device – but hold off on the official launch. The firm might also just release the two minor-upgrade devices in September and leave the premium version for a later date. But with all the technology that is causing the highly-anticipated smartphones delays, users should start preparing themselves to pay $1,000 for their iPhone 8 when it does finally launch.    Read more: Launch of next-generation iPhone 8 may be pushed to October or November, says report | 9to5Mac Apple may delay new iPhone launch to October-November, says paper iPhone 8 Pre-Orders Still Expected in September, But Shipments Likely Delayed Until 'Several Weeks Later' - Mac Rumors Share or comment on this article e-mail 11 shares Most watched News videos Man forcibly removed from plane because flight was overbooked Shocking video shows Colorado cop body slamming sorority girl Second passenger's video of man being ripped off UA flight Dizzy video showcases glass-bottomed swimming pool 40 stories high Doctor who was 'knocked out' on flight is bleeding from the face Shocking footage shows drink driver launching over roundabout Huge ship batters through terrifying heavy winds Video shows Robert Seman from courthouse balcony before trial Poisonous cobra gives unsuspecting man kiss of death on cheek California man films mountain collapse near cars in Malibu Moment suspected suicide bomber appears to attack Egyptian church Motorcyclist breaks speed limit as friend collides with car Airport cop is SUSPENDED over United scandal as new video...

Factors like premium price points and limited port options contribute to Apple’s overall drop in the results, although Apple’s quality tech support is a redeeming factor, the survey says. Sony A6500 Apple has taken the top spot since the survey started in 2010, so which brands outrank the MacBook in 2017? Lenovo takes the top spot followed by Asus, Dell, and HP. Acer tied Apple for fifth place. While the survey considers Apple’s new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar models introduced last fall, it also channels common complaints that some had about the new machines. Namely that Apple raised the price of MacBook Pros with the new machines (and left versions of the old machines on the market without updating them to hit previous prices), replaced legacy I/O with USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 which is only now starting to become mainstream, and relied on the new Touch Bar for touch input versus a full-on touchscreen that many PC laptops offer. While Apple leads in design, tech support, and warranty coverage, overall reviews are hurt by so-called innovative features, overall price, and the number of laptop options from Apple. Laptop EIC Mark Spoonauer points to premium prices with hardware that makes working more difficult for pros and suggests Apple should reconsider its approach to pro notebook hardware similar to its revised roadmap for pro desktops. Last week Apple dropped its usual playbook to address concern over its focus on the professional desktop Mac space. Apple made the 2013 Mac Pro a slightly better value by offering higher end configs at existing prices. Apple is also working on a new modular Mac Pro and Apple-branded pro display that will ship sometime after this year, and new iMacs with pro configs are coming later this year. As for the MacBook lineup, this year could potentially be a one-off blip for the survey results. Analysts predict MacBook prices will fall this year as second generation options add higher end configurations including 32GB RAM on 15-inch MacBook Pro models.

Transparency Market Research has observed that these players have been focused on creating value with acquisitions. Strengthening their presence in the healthcare API market and at the same time, offering innovative solutions to cater to the needs of their customers has been the key growth strategy for most companies. Fill the form to gain deeper insights on this market @ http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=S&rep_id=13118 „Large players have also been partnering with various healthcare facilities and healthcare technology providers to reach out to more customers,” the lead author of the study finds. For instance, in June 2014, Apple Inc. made its first big move in mobile health by partnering with market-leading hospital software firm Epic Systems and renowned healthcare provider Mayo Clinic to develop HealthKit, a health app platform. Concerns over Data Privacy and Security Threaten Global Growth An increase in the initiatives by electronic health record (EHR) vendors and healthcare IT startups has resulted in an immense growth in healthcare IT solutions, including application programming interfaces. The adoption of API-integrated EHR has risen rapidly in the recent past thanks to the ease of data accessibility and this, in turn, has boosted the market for healthcare API. Leading vendors such as GE Healthcare, Mulesoft, Practise Fusion, and Practo Technologies have been focused on making sure their solutions are compatible with the latest healthcare apps. This is also projected to benefit the healthcare API market. „Considering that the need for frequent upgrades in the overall healthcare API market will arise in the near future, the impact of this driver will remain moderate in the coming years,” the analyst predicts. However, concerns regarding privacy breaches and the loss as well as manipulation of important patient information pose a key challenge for the growth of the healthcare API market. „Open-source APIs are increasingly vulnerable to cyber-attacks and considering that the usage of APIs cannot be restrained, the privacy and security of patients becomes a major issue,” the author of the study states. Developers have, therefore, been focused on eliminating the risk of data theft by developing more secure platforms. Browse Market Research Report @ http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/healthcare-api-market.html North America Key Revenue Contributor in Global Healthcare API Market The global revenue of the healthcare API market stood at US$162.4 mn in 2015 and is expected to reach US$234.2 mn by 2024 expanding at a 4.2% CAGR therein. The appointment segment led the global healthcare API market by services, rising from a value of US$43.1 mn in 2015 to US$62.9 mn by the end of the forecast period. The segment is also anticipated to expand at the highest CAGR from 2016 to 2024. By deployment model, on-premise healthcare API solutions emerged as the leading segment while cloud-based API solutions are likely to grow at the fastest pace during the forecast period. Healthcare providers are the leading end users of healthcare API services and the segment is projected to register the highest CAGR from 2016 to 2024. While North America emerged as the key revenue contributor in the global healthcare API market, Asia Pacific is likely to be the fastest growing regional segment.

Crimson Hexagon is a leader in deriving intelligence from social data. The company used its library of 1 trillion social media posts to gain an understanding into what streaming features consumers love, and what factors they consider when making a purchase. Whilst focussed on US data, the insights can be applied to the local market: • Roku’s conversation about conversion (someone who says they purchased the product) is much higher than Apple TV. While Apple TV generates more than twice as much purchase interest/ consideration, the Roku audience is converting to purchase (6%) at higher levels than the Apple TV audience (3%). This signals that Apple TV has room for efforts tailored at generating buying desire and conversion. Roku also draws a higher percentage of post-purchase dialogue that includes audiences saying they are watching content on the device • There is significantly higher post-purchase chatter from females, and a higher pre-purchase conversation by males. This could mean males are the decision-makers for purchasing these products, and those females are more likely to review or share their experiences • Roku broke the streaming market early but was still an underdog. A look at the social conversations around Roku and Apple TV revealed younger users are attracted to the Roku’s low price tag, whilst Apple TV has a firm foothold with those over 35 • The reasons people buy Roku products are: affordability, product was received as a gift, and the presence of a headphone port • The cross-pollination of Apple’s ecosystem is the largest portion of discussion for Apple TV buyers, followed by the subcategories of integration for AirPlay and Apple Music. The ease of integration is the main draw, which makes sense because if you look at the interests of the Apple TV audience, they align with the traditional interests of Apple customers: Development, Design, and Advertising.

The store's design will be similar to Apple's multi-level World Trade Center location in New York City, the person said. Antara Fashion Hall will mark Apple's second retail location in Mexico after opening its Via Santa Fe store last year, also in Mexico City. Elsewhere in Latin America, Apple will soon decide whether to open two additional stores in Brazil, potentially including a flagship store in São Paulo, according to our source. Apple is also said to be exploring leases for its first store in Argentina, which is expected to open by the end of 2018. Meanwhile, in the United States, Apple continues to revamp a number of its older retail locations. Apple said its Burlington, Massachusetts store will be temporarily closed for renovations starting April 23, while GeekWire recently uncovered plans for a new University Village store in Seattle. MacRumors has also received unconfirmed tips about Apple's plans to relocate its stores at Valley Fair in Santa Clara, CA and Woodfield Mall in Schaumburg, IL. Apple now has over 35 next-generation Apple Stores in the United States, including its newly reopened Woodland Mall store in Grand Rapids, MI.

Designer Martin Hajek, who has a track record of creating 3D renders of rumored Apple products, put together a new iPhone 8 concept for German site Computer Bild, based on speculation about the device. Apple is rumored to be making some big hardware changes to celebrate the iPhone’s 10th anniversary, some of which include edge-to-edge OLED screens, removal of the home button, a glass-and-steel body, and wireless charging.

Now that it has made this decision, Apple has posted GPU-related job listings as it seeks to bring in more talent to work on its GPU designs. The Telegraph spotted that Apple’s jobs board for the United Kingdom currently has 12 “Hardware Engineering” job postings. The positions are based at Apple’s UK Design Center with 11 of the 12 listings being connected to GPU design. One such job posting is for an Engineering Program Manager who will be tasked with working in a “newly formed graphics design team” in order to work on the “definition of the architecture, spec, design, and verification of graphics IP from concept through to silicon.” Apple certainly needs more talent within its ranks now that it’s going to work on its own graphics technology for future mobile devices. It will no longer work with Imagination Technologies on this even though the two have a partnership going back several years. The company hasn’t explained why it’s cutting ties with Imagination Technologies but it’s possibly due to Apple’s inclination to get more control over the hardware that it puts out. Moving GPU design in-house will enable the company to further improve the technology as per its vision. Filed in Apple. Read more about gpu.

Ben Lovejoy - Apr. 10th 2017 7:03 am PT @benlovejoy Feature Mac Monitors View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Many of us were deeply disappointed when Apple appeared to be exiting the display business last summer. Not just because we want matching aesthetics and the reassurance you get with an all-Apple setup, but also because there was no obvious third-party replacement. All Apple said at the time was that ‘there are a number of great third-party options available for Mac users,’ but without pointing to anything in particular. When the company finally did make an official recommendation in the form of the LG UltraFine 4K and 5K monitors, it wasn’t exactly a great one. Not only are the monitors extremely un-Apple-like in their grey plastic cases, but a serious technical fault first identified by us led to the temporary withdrawal of the product until LG fixed the Wi-Fi interference problem. All in all, it was a mess. The good news is that this mess has likely played a role in Apple doing a U-turn and making plans to get back into the display business … NordVPN There have been some who argued that Apple never officially said that it was quitting display manufacturing in the first place. While that’s technically true, it would be naive to imagine that this was all part of some grand master plan on the part of the company. You don’t launch a monitor in 2011, fail to update it for six years, discontinue it without a replacement, advise customers to get a third-party model instead and finally co-announce a third-party monitor for use with your shiny new MacBook Pro models if you were planning to stay in the business all along. That would make zero sense. This is undeniably an about-face on the part of the company. Apple hasn’t told us anything about its display plans. In fact, in the entire transcript of the briefing Apple gave in revealing plans for a new Mac Pro, there was exactly one unprompted sentence about it. Schiller said only that it would be a ‘pro display.’ As part of doing a new Mac Pro — it is, by definition, a modular system — we will be doing a pro display as well. In response to a question, he did also appear to rule out a touchscreen. [Would you consider a touch display?] No [laughter]. We’ve talked a lot about touch on the Mac. It’s certainly, as we’ve talked to pros, not a big request for things they would want in a Mac Pro and not the problems that they most want us to solve. And then, of course, there’s the whole other discussion we’ve had many times about why we believe that MacOS and iOS are distinct and each optimized to be best at what they’re best at. That’s a whole other long discussion we can get into, but suffice it to say, it’s not a big need of the Mac Pro customers that we’re trying to address. But beyond that, we were given no steer on what the company has in mind. We can, though, draw some conclusions based on what the company has done in partnering with LG to spec-up the UltraFine models it currently offers as its officially recommended monitors. So let’s start by looking at these in terms of the display panels themselves. There’s a 21.5-inch 4K model, and a 27-inch 5K, so these would certainly be the minimum sizes and resolutions on offer. I think Schiller gave us a clue when he referred to ‘display’ singular, so I’m not expecting a 21.5-inch model, even though some pros like to stack them. That leaves us with a single model no smaller than 27-inches. Would Apple go further in either size or resolution? Where resolution is concerned, 8K monitors are a thing now – but so far at a massive cost. The Dell 32 UltraSharp 8K Monitor costs an eye-watering $5,000. That’s a huge amount of money even for an Apple monitor. So my money is on a 5K monitor. On size, Apple has made 27-inch monitors and iMacs forever, so clearly it thinks that’s a sweetspot – and it’s still an extremely popular size for third-party monitors. But I do think the world is moving on. We’re seeing a growing number of 32-inch 4K monitors on the market at the kind of prices we used to pay for 27-inch ones. If I had to put money on it, I’d expect Apple to stick to 27-inch, but I do think 32-inch is at least a possibility. Both LG monitors also use IPS panels, which offer very wide viewing angles. Apple used IPS panels even in the elderly Thunderbolt Display, so I think this is a given in a new one. I think it will also stick with a 60Hz refresh rate – this is the established standard for non-gaming monitors. Both LG monitors also support the P3 wide color gamut, and I’d say this is also a certainty with any new monitor pitched at the pro market. Apple could have gone with aRGB, which is more typical for pro monitors, but P3 is the color space choice of cinematographers, and video is arguably becoming a more important market than photographic prints, which is where aRGB shines. I’d also expect a pro-focused Apple monitor to offer 10-bit color – something you currently get in LG’s 5K monitor but not the 4K one. Finally, before we move on from the panel, there’s the question of matte versus glossy displays. If Apple truly listened to pro users, it would offer the choice. There are many of us who still miss the gorgeous matte display of the 30-inch Apple Cinema Display. But much as I’d love to see a matte option reappear, I don’t think it’s likely: Apple seems convinced that glossy screens are all we need. Let’s turn next to ports. The LG monitors also go all-in on USB-C. Both feature a single-cable USB-C connection that combines power, data, video and audio feeds. The monitors also offer three USB-C downstream connections for USB & Thunderbolt peripherals. The single-cable connection makes for a very neat setup, but ports are one area where I think Apple may revisit the specs. The company says it has been listening to pros, and one thing many pros have been saying is that they have a whole bunch of AV accessories with connectivity ranging from USB-A through optical audio to HDMI. If Apple truly plans to design a monitor which reflects feedback from professional users, I suspect we’ll see some back-pedalling on the ‘one port to do it all’ approach. One further disappointment with the 21.5-inch UltraFine is that it only delivers 60w of power to a connected Mac – enough for the 13-inch MacBook Pro, but not the 15-inch. I’d hope that Apple would offer an 85W power feed in any monitor offered. Enough tech, let’s talk design. This has been one of the biggest complaints about the LG UltraFine monitors Apple tried to push at us. The specs are impressive, but the aesthetics are anything but. It’s a subjective judgement, of course, but I don’t think anyone could disagree that the grey plastic sits somewhere on the ‘nondescript to pig-ugly’ scale. We don’t, I think, have to do much guessing where the design is concerned: Apple will take its cues from the discontinued Thunderbolt Display with elements from the 5K iMac and 2016 MacBook Pro. That would give us an overall design not dissimilar to the old display but with thinner bezels – and possibly a thin aluminum surround framing the black glass as per the MacBook Pro. We can expect the same 5mm thin edge as the iMac, and I fully expect Apple to retain the familiar and much-loved aluminum stand. Finally, price. The LG UltraFine 5K Display comes in at $1299.95, and an Apple-branded one certainly isn’t going to be cheaper, so that sets the price floor. But with glass and aluminum replacing plastic, perhaps a few more ports and that Apple logo, it is certain to cost more. My guess would be around $1500 for a 27-inch model, or around $2000 if the company opts for a 32-inch one. The executive summary, then, is this: a 5K monitor looking like a cross between the old Apple Thunderbolt Display and the 5K iMac. Probably 27-inch, with a small possibility of 32-inches. IPS display, 60Hz refresh rate, P3 color gamut. Probably gloss finish only, with a tiny possibility of a matte option. Single-port USB-C cable, and additional USB-C ports, but also HMDI and perhaps more. 85w power deliver. Costing $1500 (27-inch) or $2000 (32-inch). Would Apple sell one of these to you?

Buried in their announcement of the NVIDIA Titan Xp, NVIDIA has also made a rather surprising revelation: that they will be releasing macOS drivers for their Pascal architecture GPUs. This comes despite the fact that Apple hasn’t sold a Mac Pro that can officially accept a PCIe video card in almost half a decade. When Apple released the trash can shaped and highly customized Mac Pro design in 2013 – one, coincidentally enough, they’ll be walking away from for the next iteration – Apple also sealed the fate for end-user video card upgrades on the Macintosh platform. Every Mac now uses a customized, integrated video card of some kind, from the soldered-on MacBook Pro up to the custom format cards of the Mac Pro. This has meant that as the old, Westmere-based Mac Pro towers have aged into retirement, so has the market for Mac video card upgrades. For NVIDIA, this is a bit of a double-whammy. NVIDIA owns the bulk of the discrete video card market, and at the same time, Apple hasn’t integrated an NVIDIA GPU in some time now; the last NVIDIA-equipped Mac was the 2014 MacBook Pro, which included an NVIDIA Kepler GPU. As a result, NVIDIA has been locked out of the Mac video card market entirely for the last couple of years, and consequently makes NVIDIA’s announcement so surprising. So why is NVIDIA releasing a Mac driver to a market that, officially speaking, is essentially dead? It’s telling that this is a question NVIDIA doesn’t even bother to address, simply stating that they’re “making the new TITAN Xp open to the Mac community with new Pascal drivers” in order to give “Mac users access to the immense horsepower delivered by our award-winning Pascal-powered GPUs.” At best, the official market is the remaining handful of Mac Pro Tower owners. Instead it’s the off-label use that makes this announcement interesting, and indeed gives NVIDIA any reason whatsoever to make a Pascal driver release. Within the Mac community there are small but none the less vocal user groups based around both unsupported external GPUs and not-even-Apple-hardware Hackintoshes. In the case of the former, while macOS doesn’t support external GPUs (and isn’t certified as eGFX complaint by Intel), it’s possible to use Macs with Thunderbolt eGFX chassis with a bit of OS patching. Meanwhile with a bit more hacking, it’s entirely possible to get macOS running on a custom-built PC, leading to the now long-running Hackintosh space. The fact of the matter is that neither of these groups is very big relative to the much bigger Mac user base – who wants to do real professional work on an unsupported video card setup? – but they are vocal, and they do need increasingly powerful video cards, like the rest of the PC market. But more to the point, given Apple’s announcement that they’re going to eventually fix the Mac Pro’s GPU woes, but not for at least another year, this is a chance for NVIDIA to take a low-risk pot shot at Apple for their dGPU follies. At a minimum, it’s a nice gesture to Mac users (whom tend to spend big on hardware), and perhaps, it makes for the start of a grassroots campaign to get an NVIDIA GPU in the next iMac or Mac Pro. And while only NVIDIA knows for sure if they planned this before this week’s Mac Pro announcement or they just got lucky, it comes across as a clever move by the company. Otherwise, from a technical perspective, there’s little reason for NVIDIA not to do this. The company needs to keep Mac driver development for new architectures alive regardless so that they can compete for future GPU contracts, meaning NVIDIA already has the drivers in-house, though perhaps not in an end-user ready state. Given how the whole endeavor is essentially unsupported from the Apple side of matters, this may make for a bumpy ride at the start. But I think it will be interesting to see where the NV-GPU equipped Mac user base stands in a year or two when Apple readies their next Mac Pro, and if NVIDIA’s gesture has any real impact on the number of NVIDIA users out there.

I'm really surprised how long this model has endured due to Apple's missteps. Considering that on the CPU side, the 2013 model of the Mac Pro only bests my model in AVX based code, my system is still state-of-the-art on the Mac side. With my GPU and SSD upgrades, I've got a machine faster than what Apple is currently selling in several aspects. I also have greater memory capacity (128 GB). If I really wanted to go crazy, I wonder if the Quadro GP100 is supported under those macOS drivers...

Yes, its the iPhone 8 (or iPhone X) that is expected to be Apple’s flagship smartphone at its September launch this year, and not the usual and expected iPhone 7s and 7s Plus models. The exotic iPhone 8 with a 5.8-inch display however, will not arrive in markets on time but will be delayed by a few months until the holiday season. According to Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White, who sent out a note to investors on Friday explaining that Apple’s 5.8-inch iPhone won’t arrive along with the rest in September. As told to CNBC, White hinted citing contacts that Apple will offer its 3D sensing technology and OLED displays only with the 5.8-inch iPhone 8. But according to the same contact, the model will be delayed by several weeks because of the challenges related to the technology. The same sensors will be vital to the augmented reality technology (AR) that Apple is expected to showcase with iPhone 8. However, it’s bad news all the way as fans and customers will still be able to pre-order the 5.8-inch model along with the standard 4.7-inch unit and the 5.5-inch unit in September. But these will again not have the fancy new features, so it is pretty clear that many may actually have to pre-order and wait until the holidays arrive. At the same time, it is kind of a confusing situation as the price of the iPhone 8 is supposed to be pretty high thanks to all the exotic tech that’s packed into it.

Max Langridge and Britta O'Boyle10 April 2017Tablets Apple / Pocket-lint Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment Apple quietly released a new iPad in March 2017, simply called iPad. The new model replaces the iPad Air 2 as Apple's standard tablet offering, sitting above the iPad mini 4 and below the two iPad Pro models. The iPad Air 2 might have been discontinued through the Apple online store, but you can still pick it up at other retailers. We have therefore put the new 9.7-inch iPad up against its predecessor to see what the differences are and what changes have been made. You can also read how the new iPad compares to the iPad Pro 9.7 in our separate feature.  Apple iPad Air 2 review Apple iPad Pro 9.7 review New Apple iPad (2017) vs iPad Air 2: Design Same lovely, solid aluminium build  No rose gold colour option for either iPad Pro is thinner and lighter  The Apple iPad Air 2 measures 240 x 169.5 x 6.1mm and weighs 437g. It comes in three colours comprising gold, silver and space grey and it's thinner and lighter than the original iPad Air with a lovely, solid design. The new Apple iPad (2017) has the same design as the iPad Air 2, and on the surface you'd be hard pressed to tell the difference. The new iPad has put on a bit of weight though, coming in at 469g for the Wi-Fi only model and 478g for the Wi-Fi and 4G LTE variant - making it heavier than the iPad Pro 9.7 too. In reality, this weight difference won't make much difference to your experience, but it's something worth noting.  The new iPad also has a slightly thicker frame, coming at 7.5mm compared to the iPad Air 2's svelte 6.1mm, which is down to the lack of fully laminated display on the new model. Both the new iPad and iPad Air 2 are the same when it comes to height and width though and they also have the same aluminium build and Touch ID sensor within the home button.  Like the iPad Air 2, the new iPad (2017) is only available in the same space grey, gold and silver colours, with no rose gold option like the iPad Pro 9.7. Apple iPad Pro 9.7 vs iPad Pro 12.9: What's the difference? New Apple iPad (2017) vs iPad Air 2: Display Both have 9.7-inch, 2048 x 1536 pixel displays (264ppi) New iPad has brighter display iPad Air 2 has a fully laminated and anti-reflective display The Apple iPad Air 2 sits in the middle of the iPad line up when it comes to size. It has a 9.7-inch display in comparison to the 7.9-inch screen of the iPad mini and the 12.9-inch size of the larger iPad Pro. The iPad Air 2 has a resolution of 2048 x 1536, which means it offers a pixel density of 264ppi. That's the same as the original iPad Air but the iPad Air 2 comes with an anti-reflective screen, as well as a bump in contrast and colour. The latter aren't hugely noticeable but the anti-reflective technology makes a big difference and overall, the iPad Air 2's display is great. The new iPad 2017 offers the same size and resolution as the iPad Air 2, but Apple claims the new model has a brighter screen. As we mentioned though, it loses out on the fully laminated and anti-reflective features found on the iPad Air 2 and Pro models, which is why the new model is a little thicker. Neither the iPad Air 2 or the new iPad have Apple's True Tone technology on board.  What is Apple's True Tone display? New Apple iPad (2017) vs iPad Air 2: Camera Both tablets have same front and rear cameras 8MP rear camera, 1.2MP front-facing FaceTime HD camera Up to 1080p video recording capabilities on rear The Apple iPad Air 2 and new iPad (2017) both feature an 8-megapixel rear camera, coupled with a 1.2-megapixel front camera. As tablets aren't as commonly used for taking shots as smartphones, this is more than adequate. They are the same cameras as found on the iPhone 5S, meaning that while the iPad Air 2 and new iPad's cameras are good, they aren't as good as the iPhone 6S and therefore the iPad Pro 9.7. The rear cameras will shoot video up to 1080p at 30fps, while the front camera will offer up to 720p. If you want higher resolution recording up to 4K, you'll need to look at the iPad Pro 9.7. Regardless of what you think about using an iPad as a camera, the iPad Air 2 and new iPad both perform well so if you want to take photos using your tablet, both will hold you in good stead. New Apple iPad Pro vs iPad Pro 9.7: What's the difference? New Apple iPad (2017) vs iPad Air 2: Hardware New iPad has A9 chipset Same internal storage options Both have up to 10-hour battery life The Apple iPad Air 2 comes with the A8X chip and the M8 motion co-processor. This is supported by 2GB of RAM and there are internal storage options of 32GB and 128GB with no microSD support, as is the way with all Apple devices. The new iPad (2017) meanwhile features a slightly faster 64-bit A9 processor. It's not quite on the same level as the A9X processor found in the iPad Pro, but it should provide a noticeable increase in performance over the iPad Air 2. Both the iPad Air 2 and new iPad are claimed to deliver up to 10 hours battery life. The new iPad comes in the same 32GB and 128GB storage options as the outgoing Air 2 and of course, there's no microSD support. Apple has once again stuck to its dual speaker setup for the new iPad, so while sound quality will be good, it won't be as powerful as the four speaker setup on the iPad Pro. There is also no Apple Pencil or Smart Keyboard compatibility on either the iPad Air 2 or the new iPad. New Apple iPad (2017) vs iPad Air 2: Software Both run iOS 10 Both the Apple iPad Air 2 and the new iPad 9.7 run on iOS 10, meaning the software experience will be almost identical across these two models. The new model doesn't come with any additional features, such as Apple Pencil compatibility as we mentioned, so in this instance the two will be completely identical. Apple iOS 10 review New Apple iPad (2017) vs iPad Air 2: Price New iPad (2017) is £40 cheaper The Apple iPad Air 2 starts at £379 and goes up to £499, depending on which storage capacity you choose and whether you opt for Wi-Fi only or Wi-Fi and Cellular. The new iPad (2017) on the other hand, has a starting price of £339, stretching to £559 for the highest storage capacity and Wi-Fi and Cellular.  New Apple iPad (2017) vs iPad Air 2: Which should you buy? Both the iPad Air 2 and the new iPad (2017) are great tablets. Not a huge amount has changed in the new model, except for a lower price, which is always welcome, a faster processor and a lack of the fully laminated display. Aside from those differences, you're looking at the same tablet so the only reason to buy the iPad Air 2 over the new iPad is if you can find it significantly cheaper. If you were putting off buying an iPad because you felt they were too expensive, now is probably the best time yet.

It will be a “very unique area” for broadcasting Beats 1, said the source. It’s unclear if the rumored booth will feature one of the existing Beats 1 anchors. For context, Beats 1 Radio currently broadcasts out of Los Angeles, New York City and London. New York City anchor Ebro Darden, who appears to broadcast from a studio in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, may broadcast his Beats 1 Radio show in front of a live audience visiting Apple’s flagship store. The Fifth Avenue outlet has been closed for renovations since January 20. When finished, the revamped store will feature Apple’s next-generation retail layout and over twice as much square footage as before. Apple’s Vice President of Apps and Content, Robert Kondrk, and Apple Music’s content boss, Larry Jackson, told The Verge last month that Beats 1 is the biggest radio station in the world. Drake’s latest project, for example, was streamed 89.9 million times in just 24 hours of being available on Apple Music. “It’s the biggest radio station in the world. There’s no way you’re going to find another station that has as many concurrent listeners and audience-wise as Beats 1, period,” Jackson said.

IE Home Nation World Opinion Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Technology Viral Photos Videos E-Paper Apps RSS Gadgets Review Photos Videos Mobile & Tabs Science Indian Express Home Home Technology Apple iPhone 8 could be delayed due to 3D sensing technology: Report Apple iPhone 8 could be delayed due to 3D sensing technology: Report Apple's highly-anticipated iPhone 8 smartphone might get delayed, claims a new report By: Tech Desk | New Delhi | Updated: April 10, 2017 7:23 pm Apple is planning to use 3D sensing technology in the iPhone 8, fueling company’s growing interest in the augmented reality space. Apple is expected to release the iPhone 8 in September, however, a new report claims that the next-generation smartphone might be delayed. The information comes from Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White (via CNBC), who claims that the upcoming phone could be delayed “beyond” September citing difficulties related to the 3D sensing technology. White, though, mentioned that the phone could arrive in December, meaning there are chances that Apple might be in a position to release the device at the time of the holiday season. He wrote: “First off, our smartphone contact believes the 3D sensing technology and OLED displays will only be offered with the 5.8-inch iPhone 8,” Also read: OnePlus 3T, Samsung A7, Moto Z Play: The best smartphones for under Rs 35k “However, our contact strongly believes the 5.8-inch iPhone will be delayed by several weeks due to challenges around the 3D sensing technology but still in time for the December holidays.” Reports in the past have claimed that Apple is planning to use 3D sensing technology in the iPhone 8, fueling company’s growing interest in the augmented reality space. With a 3D camera,  Apple will introduce a number of advanced facial recognition. Additionally, the phone will be able to take 3D selfies. The 3D sensing tech and OLED displays, as White notes, are reserved for the 5.8-inch iPhone 8. If you by the report, then the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus should be made available in September without any delay.  But this isn’t the first time we’re hearing of Apple iPhone 8 being delayed. Earlier last week, another report suggested that the iPhone 8 might not launch until October or November, as suppliers are reportedly finding difficulties with the display lamination process, while also experiencing issues when it comes to integrating the 3D sensing camera on the front of the device. 2017 marks the 10th anniversary of the iPhone , which was first announced by Steve Jobs on 9 January 2007, and released later that year on June 29.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 10 April 2017 by Military News Lenovo Tops Laptop Mag’s Annual Brand Rankings, Apple Falls to 5th Place NEW YORK, April 10, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — In a major industry shake-up, Apple is no longer the leading laptop brand. After dominating Laptop Mag’s Best and Worst Brands for seven years in a row, the MacBook-maker dropped to fifth place this year. Lenovo took first place in Laptop Mag’s special report, followed by Asus, Dell and HP. Each year since 2010, Laptop Mag, part of Purch’s tech brand portfolio, has published its Best and Worst Laptop Brands list, which rates the major manufacturers based on product quality, innovation, value and selection, design, and tech support.   While Apple still delivers top-notch support, the company dropped dramatically in the overall list due to lower review scores and limited value and selection in its lineup. This year, the company alienated many mainstream consumers by pricing its new laptops above $1,299. On the high end, Apple’s new MacBook Pros got rid of the USB ports and SD-card readers that creative professionals need. „Apple fell so sharply because the company focused on more expensive systems with nice-to-have features like the Touch Bar while moving too quickly to ditch the features creative pros rely on,” said Mark Spoonauer, Laptop Mag’s editor-in-chief. „Other laptop brands have really stepped up their game, especially in the 2-in-1 category.” Lenovo won the Best and Worst Brands by producing many high-quality laptops, particularly in its ThinkPad and Yoga lines. The company also provided strong support and industry-leading innovations, like the Yoga Book and its completely flat Halo keyboard. „Lenovo has had one of the best and most innovative product lines in the business for a long time,” said Avram Piltch, Laptop Mag’s editorial director. „This year, the company took its products to the next level and brought its support along for the ride.” Of the 10 brands rated, Microsoft placed last, not because of poor quality but rather a lack of new products and innovation. The company’s only laptop-related product release during the evaluation period, which lasted from Feb. 1, 2016, to March 1, 2017, was a new performance dock for its existing Surface Book. Samsung took ninth place due to a combination of poor tech support, limited selection and lower-rated products.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Lifestyle / Mobile / Apple / Apple is seeking out graphics engineers in latest hiring spree Apple is seeking out graphics engineers in latest hiring spree Matthew Wilson 18 hours ago Apple, Featured Announcement, Featured Tech News, Graphics Earlier this month we learned that Apple would be abandoning its use of IMG’s graphics technology for iOS devices in two years time. At the time, Imagination Technologies (IMG) had some doubts about Apple’s ability to produce its own mobile GPU but it looks like Apple is looking to prove them wrong, as the company has begun a hiring spree in search of graphics engineers. Right now, IMG relies on Apple for a good chunk of its income. The company also didn’t see this move coming as Imagination execs believe it would be nearly impossible for Apple to design a new mobile GPU without infringing on at least one of its patents. Still, Apple is going to do it anyway and is already hiring for a UK-based development team. According to Electronics Weekly, these are the GPU-related jobs Apple is currently hiring for: Design Verification Engineer Design Verification Lead Engineering Program Manager Graphics Content Engineer Graphics hardware Performance Engineer Graphics Micro Architect Graphics RTL Design Engineer Graphics Senior RTL Design Engineer Hardware Modeling Engineer RTL Design Engineer RTL Power Optimisation Engineer Apple does have GPU-related teams set up at some of its other campus locations already and apparently, many former Imagination Technologies employees have already jumped ship to Apple. Once its own GPU is built and ready, Apple will no longer have to pay royalties for licensed graphics tech inside of its iPads or iPhones. KitGuru Says: It was already assumed that Apple would be building its own GPU once its deal with Imagination expires in two years but this new hiring spree seems to set that in stone. Now we just have to wait and see what Apple can come up with next. The company has already succeeded with its own CPU architecture, so hopefully its future GPU tech will live up to the same standard.  Share Facebook Twitter Google + Stumbleupon LinkedIn Pinterest Tags Apple gpu IMG news Previous Google Pixel 2 will reportedly jump to curved displays from LG Next Kodi wants to attract more legal content, may implement DRM to help Check Also AMD is getting into wireless VR headset technology When AMD launched its Radeon RX 480 graphics card it promised to deliver VR for … Polls Which CPU air cooler next?

The prototype Apple 1 computer on display The exhibit will house what Living Computers executive director Lāth Carlson described as "the most important computer in history," a prototype Apple I that sat in Steve Jobs' office and was used as a demo model in the early years of the company. Visitors will be able to interact with an Apple 1, although it'll be a different version than the Jobs machine, while also viewing Apple computers like the Apple II, IIe, IIc, Apple III, Lisa, and various Macintosh computers. Although Carlson admitted that Jobs' Apple 1 is “also the most boring to look at," its importance has earned it a spot as the centerpiece of the new exhibit. “About 200 of these were made, around 70 are known to have survived, and around seven are operable,” Carlson told GeekWire while showing off the museum’s working 1976 Apple I. “We’re going to be running Steve Wozniak’s version of BASIC that he wrote on it.” The exhibit includes details about Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs, the Homebrew Computer Club in Palo Alto, the original $666.66 price point for the Apple I, and "much more." A point of focus in the new exhibit is Apple's early connection with Microsoft, and the museum itself was founded by Paul Allen, who co-founded Microsoft with Bill Gates. “We’ve always actually had a fairly significant Apple collection, and we’ve always had Apples on display,” Carlson said. “I think people a lot of times come here and are a little surprised to see that. They associate us with Paul Allen, with Microsoft. And a lot of times people don’t realize Microsoft provided a lot of the early software and hardware for Apple, and continued to over the years. When Steve Jobs went back to Apple, there was a significant investment by Microsoft — $150 million — to keep the company basically going. And they agreed to keep providing Office for Macs.” The Apple 1 in question is said to have been used by Jobs and Apple’s first investor, Mike Markkula, as a modified version of the basic computer that the company used to take on the road and showcase its capabilities to potential investors. The machine was left behind by Jobs when he left Apple in 1985, and when Apple allowed employees to clean out his office, an engineer named Don Hutmacher ended up going home with the Apple 1. When Hutmacher passed away this past year, his family discovered the Apple 1 sitting in his garage, leading to its new residence at Living Computers. Overall, the Apple exhibit in the Seattle-based museum is said to organically fit into the overall story of Living Computers, including the rise of IBM and its support of Microsoft that lead to industry domination. Diverging paths will allow visitors to witness the emergence of Windows 95 in one direction, or the new "evolving story" of Apple in the other direction.

Or if his family will just take it all. It'd make a very cool museum exhibit IMO.

It is very expensive town to live as well as visit. Even the outlying suburbs are expensive. Be sure to plan out lots of travel time between places you go because traffic is really a bog, even on the weekends.

Share twitter linkedin facebook google+ email Mike Jennings Reviews 10 Apr, 2017 4 Price  £1,675 exc VAT Pros  Fast processor; Professional GPU; Decent screen quality; Solid ergonomics and design Cons  Expensive – especially if more hardware is added Verdict  Huge power and versatility inside a small and smart design – but you’ll pay for it The new Dell Precision 5520 banishes memories of blank and bulky workstations by cramming the latest Intel processors and Nvidia Quadro GPUs inside a sleek metal and carbon fibre frame. This level of extravagance means the Dell isn't cheap, but the £1,675 model we've reviewed is still a little cheaper than its key rival - the Apple MacBook Pro 15. Screen, Keyboard and Trackpad The Precision has a 15.6in screen inside a 14in chassis, with three bezels slimmed down to cram the hardware inside. The panel impresses elsewhere, too: it uses IPS technology, and the screen is sturdy despite its slim 4mm-thick frame. The screen's benchmark results are also solid. The 1,718:1 contrast ratio is excellent, and it remained at 1.666:1 when we dialled the brightness back from its retina-searing level of 378cd/m2 to a reasonable 150cd/m2. Those superb ratios combine with stonking black levels, which mean colours are rendered with subtlety and depth. The average Delta E of 2.21 is decent, and it improved to 0.78 when we dropped the brightness. In other areas, however, the panel is more ordinary. The colour temperature of 7,627K is cool, and it means the screen feels pallid. It's not too uniform, either: backlight strength swung by 13% across the bottom row and 12% across the middle. Those more middling measurements mean this screen is less capable with colour-sensitive work. And, as if to confirm that, the Precision rendered 91.8% of the sRGB gamut but only 66.8% of the Adobe RGB spectrum. Those figures are a little underwhelming for a workstation, especially when Dell boasts of the Precision's 100% Adobe RGB coverage. That disconnect occurs because two different panels are available for this machine. The entry-level model reviewed here has a 1080p screen, but that Adobe RGB designation is only available on the machine's 4K panel - an option that costs an extra £211 but also offers an IGZO touchscreen and Dell Premier Color's professional presets. The 1080p screen has great contrast, black levels and colour accuracy, which means it's solid for most work tasks - but the colour temperature and gamut coverage means it slips behind the superb colours of Apple's Retina display. It also has less real estate than the MacBook, which has a sharper 2,880 x 1,800 resolution. We have few qualms about the Precision's ergonomics. The keyboard is backlit with large buttons, and they depress with a shallow and consistent action that encourages fast, precise typing - and with more travel than the MacBook's butterfly mechanism. The only problem is minor, with larger buttons like the space bar and enter key feeling a little wobbly. The trackpad is one of Dell's gesture-heavy Precision units, and its smooth surface offers pin-sharp operation and two satisfyingly clicky buttons. The MacBook's trackpad is larger though, and offers similar quality. Design & Features The gunmetal lid extends to the Precision's bevelled edges, and the interior is coated with dark carbon fibre. It looks different from the MacBook, with its glossy black and smooth metal, but no worse - and that's no surprise, considering this machine shares its design with the excellent XPS 15. The good-looking exterior offers more versatility than Apple's notebook, with USB 3 and Thunderbolt, a battery indicator and a card reader. The downside, though, is that Dell's machine is chunkier: the Dell's 22mm body is thicker than the 15.5mm MacBook, and both weigh around 1.8kg. This may not be much of a problem, however, as many workstation laptops tend to spend most of their time at a desk. Dell has also loaded this machine up with useful software: the Power Manager serves up battery and power options, while the Precision Optimizer has monitoring information alongside profiles for work applications like CAD tools and graphic design utilities. It's ISV-certified, too. Hardware and Specs The Dell arrives with Intel's Kaby Lake architecture, and its choice of chip outpaces the older Skylake part inside the MacBook. The entry-level Precision includes an i5-7300HQ processor, which has four 2.5GHz cores that Turbo to 3.5GHz, but no Hyper-Threading. Apple's entry-level machine comes with a Core i7-6700HQ that starts at 2.6GHz and Turbo Boosts to 3.6GHz, and it does have Hyper-Threading - but it also uses an older architecture. Graphical grunt comes from the Nvidia Quadro M1200. It's a mid-range mobile chip tuned to the needs of work software, and it has 640 stream processors alongside a 1,093MHz core - a solid specification that also has 4GB of memory. Those specifications are marginally better than the AMD Radeon Pro 450 inside the MacBook, which has 640 stream processors but a slower 800MHz core and just 2GB of dedicated RAM. The Dell has 2,400MHz memory, which is faster than Apple, but its 8GB allocation is half as much as the MacBook offers. Apple fights back in storage, too: the Precision has a 256GB Toshiba XG3 SSD that delivers speeds of 1.4GB/s and 1.1GB/s, but the MacBook's PCI drive delivered speeds of 3.1GB/s and 1.4GB/s - a blazing pace that we've yet to see anyone come close to matching. There's very little to choose between the two machines in benchmarks: the Dell has a newer processor and slightly better GPU, but the MacBook has Hyper-Threading and better storage. They're both exceptionally quick machines with solid benchmark scores - the Dell's overall score of 90 in our application tests isn't far short of the powerful desktop chip we used as our reference result. The Precision has the grunt to run intensive tasks, and its SPECviewperf 12 scores further demonstrated its ability: it returned a solid score of 44.8 in the 3DSMax test, and 61.38 in the SW-03 benchmark. Impressively, Dell's machine produced this level of performance while remaining chilled - the fan noise was modest, and the Precision's exterior only became a little warmer during benchmarks and stress-tests. The processor's peak temperature of 91°C is a tad high, but the clock speed never throttled and the silicon never became unstable. The Precision's three-cell battery lasted for eight hours and 56 minutes in our standard test - a good result that's almost identical to the MacBook. Alternative Specifications Dell's machine is littered with potential upgrades, but this versatility makes it even pricier than the MacBook Pro. Upgrading to a Core i7 costs £151, and deploying a beefy Xeon E3-1505M v6 costs £226. The 4K screen is £211, and doubling the memory costs £93. Upgrading to a 512GB SSD is £327, and doubling the battery capacity costs £31. Fitting a Core i7 CPU, 4K screen and 16GB of memory increases the price to £2,034, which is more than the entry-level MacBook Pro 15. The standard three-year warranty is a generous next-business-day deal, but upgrading to ProSupport costs £193 - and extending that deal is more expensive still. Conclusion The Precision 5520 is a superb laptop that crams huge functionality into a small, attractive exterior. The Kaby Lake processor is fast, and the Nvidia Quadro GPU means this machine will handle graphical tasks with aplomb. Even the entry-level machine is expensive, though, and it's still hindered by its 1080p screen and middling SSD. To fix those problems, you'll need to spend a lot more - which makes the MacBook's Retina display all the more tempting. Regardless of the specification, though, the Precision remains a top-quality choice for workstation power in an impressively small package - the entry-level specification is cheaper than the MacBook, and its customisable components help it become more versatile than the Apple. If you need true workstation performance in a lightweight package, the Precision easily justifies its cost.

Technology Explained What Is the Right to Repair and Why Should You Care? Bertel King, Jr. April 10, 2017 10-04-2017 6 minutes What Is the Right to Repair and Why Should You Care? Facebook Twitter Pinterest Stumbleupon Whatsapp Email When old technology broke, you could fix it yourself or get a guy down the road to do it for you. If that failed, you could find a repair shop that would get the job done for much less than going straight to the manufacturer. With newer products, those options are disappearing. It is now often impossible to fix our own stuff. This change was not accidental. Companies deliberately design products to prevent us from finding replacement parts. They don’t even make information available to repair shops. Manufacturers have actively undermined our right to repair what we buy, and in doing so, they’ve called into question whether we truly own our purchases at all. Increasingly, the answer is no. This change places a financial burden on us, restricts market freedom, and does lasting damage to the environment. In response, a growing number of people are demanding a change. They are insisting that our right to repair be enshrined in law. What Is the Right to Repair? This is the right to fix technology yourself or have someone other than the manufacturer do the work for you. This concept isn’t listed in the Bill of Rights, but that doesn’t make its existence seem like any less of a given. If you buy something, it’s yours. If it’s yours, you should be able to fix it. This seems obvious, but take a look at the things in your home. Can you fix the device you’re reading this on? What about the game console under your TV? If your smart speaker suffered from a physical defect, do you have any option aside from asking for a refund or sending it back for repairs? Are you aware of a repair shop you could send it to instead? Why Do We Need Laws? Over the past century, companies across any number of industries have increasingly designed their products to become obsolete Planned Obsolescence: Why We Can't Have Nice Things Planned Obsolescence: Why We Can't Have Nice Things How much money are you wasting due to "planned obsolescence"?

Some started making proprietary parts that kept owners from extending how long a product lasts. This tactic offered a way to grow profits by increasing the number of times consumers needed to buy the same product over the course of their lives. Today, many smartphones and tablets are designed to prevent you and I from cracking them open. Apple went so far as to create a special screw to prevent consumers and repair shops from getting inside.

Either way, the manufacturer makes more money. This isn’t just a consumer tech problem. Farmers can have to haul a tractor hundreds of miles to get a manufacturer to fix the onboard computer. That’s a painful loss of time and labor. The struggle is such that a black market of John Deere parts has formed, connecting Nebraska farmers with counterparts in Eastern Europe to buy unlocked tractor firmware. In 2016, tech companies such as Apple successfully blocked a right to repair bill in New York before the measure could come to a vote. In Nebraska, John Deere and Apple both recently opposed the proposed Adopt the Fair Repair Act, with Apple’s representative arguing that such a law would make the state a “Mecca for bad actors.” Similar bills have failed in Wyoming, Kansas, Minnesota, Illinois, Tennessee, and Massachusetts. Rural states like Nebraska are especially hard hit by the status quo. Authorized retailers tend to be in major urban areas. Nebraska reportedly has one brick-and-mortar Apple store. Only a handful of authorized repair shops exist elsewhere in the state. Apple is hardly working alone. The various tech industry groups taking the company’s side in opposing Nebraska’s right to repair bill represent Google, Microsoft, Samsung, Sony, and Nintendo as well. For corporations, this is a matter of increasing profits. For repair shops, this is an issue of being able to stay in business (and being relevant). For people in the health care industry, this can be a matter of life or death. What Can You Do Right Now? Avoid the shiny and new.

Good luck replacing a dead battery on a Fitbit. Look for screws. If you can open a device using readily available tools, that’s a sign the manufacturer intends for other people to operate on the hardware.

Pressure your representatives to propose and support right to repair bills in your state. This isn’t only an issue of consumers vs the industry. Businesses benefit from this as well. In 2014, right to repair advocates and trade groups representing automakers agreed to a deal that provides independent garages and retailers with the same diagnostic tools that manufacturers give their own franchised dealers. Long-term, we need a circular economy that encourages everyone to get as much as possible from the resources we consume. Repairing and reusing our gadgets is a big part of making this happen.

But sadly, repairing our gadgets is no longer a given. If we want this situation to change, we have to demand as much from companies using our wallets and the law. The internet is also a great platform for making our voices heard. What was the last product you wanted to fix but couldn’t?

Increasingly, the answer is no." Totally false ! The products people choose to buy and the products people choose to sell is their decision - and not sthat of governemnt. And you do own you product. Whether you own the guarantee for these these products or own how these products must be buiilt is absurd. Guarantees are contracts/agreements between the seller and the buyer - they are not owned by one or the other "In response, a growing number of people are demanding a change. " As if that demand for a change is a validation of what they want. Consumers have the choice to buy a product or not - or start a new company to build the products they want. They have no right to demand what others produce of how they produce it. MUD's seeming support for the fascist view of the state dictating how things be produced and what agreements must be entered into is alarming. Reply Bertel King, Jr. April 10, 2017 at 2:40 pm Thanks for taking the time to write out a detailed response! You should know that the views expressed in this post are mine, not MakeUseOf's. You and I seem to disagree over whether the state of the marketplace (absent any involvement from any government) is an accurate representation of what consumers want. I believe there are many more factors influencing how products are made than what we choose to buy. Consumers would love to get 70 miles per gallon of gas, but that alone didn't get manufacturers to make fuel efficient cars. It took legislation to get the industry to advance to where we are now. On a similar note, manufacturers are now racing one another to make electric cars. That's more in response to legislation (many countries and cities around the world are passing strict fuel emissions restrictions) than consumer demand, since electric cars aren't yet selling all that well. But legislation to increase fuel economy or produce cleaner air are the results of what people want, even if we're willing to buy an old fuel-inefficient vehicle simply because we need something to get us to work. Whether people influence the market via their buying decisions or by pressuring their representatives to pass legislation, both are the results of people. It's a false dichotomy to say that if a company makes a repairable product of its own accord, it's the result of people, but if a company makes a repairable product as a result of legislation (that consumers pushed for), then it's not the result of people. Government and corporations are two different ways for people to organize, and in a democracy, citizens *should* have more influence over the former than the latter. We get to elect our representatives. We do not have a say over who runs a company, not matter how large an influence it may have on our lives. In a market filled with competition, where entry costs are low and new entrants appear all the time, we don't need legislation to push for a fair system. Someone can make an ideal product and people will buy it. But we're living in a world of increasing consolidation, where consumers have only a few choices (if any at all -- many cable providers have monopolies), and the cost of entry is astronomical. In such an environment, pushing for legislation is one of the best tools available to consumers. Manufacturers and retailers understand the benefits of shaping the law to increase their own well-being. In my opinion, consumers should too. Reply Howard A Pearce April 10, 2017 at 2:46 pm So in short you support the state telling associations how they must associate and what rules they must follow. A clear violation of freedom of association which covers business associations too ! - Wee Wikipedia definition., I support that civil right - you would rather the state intervene to satisfy your personal views of what associations you deem appropriate or not - what I call a fascist view of state-mandated associations. As for my mentioning MUD - it is my way of saying they need other views besides authoritarian ones like yours Reply me2 April 10, 2017 at 4:52 pm I vehemently support a "right to repair". Our "rights to......" have already been stomped on too much in just about every aspect of our lives. Johng April 10, 2017 at 7:59 pm What he is asking for is similar to the magnuson moss warranty act, which says I can use any parts I choose and any company I choose, to complete repairs. By not letting me or anyone else repair, seems by proxy, a violation of the warranty act. Outside of the warranty period is another story. Alex April 11, 2017 at 2:18 am I am sorry, sir, but you just don't have a point. Your whole comment is dumb and biased. I take it you are a high-rank executive at one of such companies or have so much money you can't care less about the right to repair what you buy. Anyhow, your comments clearly show you've lost ground and know little to nothing about the everyday struggle undergone by the working class to get a hold of their stuff. I have never commented on MUO before but I felt the urge to speak up and say how irrational your point of view is. Have a good day.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 10 April 2017 by Military News Lenovo Tops Laptop Mag’s Annual Brand Rankings, Apple Falls to 5th Place NEW YORK, April 10, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- In a major industry shake-up, Apple is no longer the leading laptop brand. After dominating Laptop Mag's Best and Worst Brands for seven years in a row, the MacBook-maker dropped to fifth place this year. Lenovo took first place in Laptop Mag's special report, followed by Asus, Dell and HP. Each year since 2010, Laptop Mag, part of Purch's tech brand portfolio, has published its Best and Worst Laptop Brands list, which rates the major manufacturers based on product quality, innovation, value and selection, design, and tech support.   While Apple still delivers top-notch support, the company dropped dramatically in the overall list due to lower review scores and limited value and selection in its lineup. This year, the company alienated many mainstream consumers by pricing its new laptops above $1,299. On the high end, Apple's new MacBook Pros got rid of the USB ports and SD-card readers that creative professionals need. "Apple fell so sharply because the company focused on more expensive systems with nice-to-have features like the Touch Bar while moving too quickly to ditch the features creative pros rely on," said Mark Spoonauer, Laptop Mag's editor-in-chief. "Other laptop brands have really stepped up their game, especially in the 2-in-1 category." Lenovo won the Best and Worst Brands by producing many high-quality laptops, particularly in its ThinkPad and Yoga lines. The company also provided strong support and industry-leading innovations, like the Yoga Book and its completely flat Halo keyboard. "Lenovo has had one of the best and most innovative product lines in the business for a long time," said Avram Piltch, Laptop Mag's editorial director. "This year, the company took its products to the next level and brought its support along for the ride." Of the 10 brands rated, Microsoft placed last, not because of poor quality but rather a lack of new products and innovation. The company's only laptop-related product release during the evaluation period, which lasted from Feb. 1, 2016, to March 1, 2017, was a new performance dock for its existing Surface Book. Samsung took ninth place due to a combination of poor tech support, limited selection and lower-rated products.

EDT April 10, 2017 (Photo: Getty Images)   CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST I’ve had big-time battery drain issues on my last three iPhones. I just figured it was my fault — maybe I’m too addicted to apps, take too many photos, or just use my phone too much? It’s an issue I’ve gone to Apple for help with many times. But the Genius’s — Apple's retail support — were flummoxed, too. After the typical troubleshooting: Update iOS? Check. Adjust screen brightness? Check. Use Wi-Fi when possible, turn off location services, and tone down notifications? Check, check, and check again. Nothing seems to solve the issues. Maybe I got the phone wet? It was time to kick things up to the next level. I enlisted experts like Scotty Loveless, a former Apple Genius and iOS tech who told me this would not be another, “turn off every useful feature of iOS posts…” because those “really grind my gears.” Finally, someone speaking my language! With that said, here’s how I finally beat the worst of my battery battles — and now you can, too. #1 Start with your own battery test Your battery should only be doing its heavy lifting when you’re actually using your iPhone, and the rest of the time it should be relaxing in standby mode. Sometimes an app prevents your phone from going into standby and wreaks havoc on your battery life. Here’s how to test it: Go into Settings > Battery. Scroll all the way down to the bottom and you’ll find two numbers, one for Standby and one for Usage. Your Usage number should be way, way lower than your Standby number. If it’s not, you might have a problem, and you can confirm it by jotting down your Standby and Usage times and then clicking the lock button on your phone. Let it sit for about five minutes and then check the numbers again. If your Standby time is five minutes higher, you’re in good shape, but if your Usage time has bumped up by a more than a minute it’s a sign that your phone isn’t resting like it should. On Android, you can get the same information under Settings > Device > Battery (or Settings > Battery if you have a newer version of Android). The information on this menu is essentially the same as it is on an iPhone, and lists “Device Idle” which is the same as standby mode. If you find that your phone isn’t “resting” when you’re not using it, there’s likely a very clear reason, which brings us to #2. #2 Don’t push me When an app is doing things even when you’re not using it, it could be malfunctioning, and stuck in an endless loop that’s draining all your power. That’s what happened to me, with, of all things, one of the email accounts I had connected to my phone. Loveless picked up on this right away. “This happens unbelievably often, especially with Exchange push email,” he said. “I knew when you told me your phone typically dies within six hours of being off the charger, and the Standby and Usage are the same. Sometimes, these times are not the same because the ‘firmware is bad or corrupted,’ but this time it’s because push email is keeping the phone from sleeping properly.” The fix was simple. Go into Settings > Mail > Accounts> Fetch New Data. Mine was automatically set to Push. Loveless recommended that I set it turn that off temporarily and set it to Fetch every 15 to 30 minutes instead. You can also use the Manual mode, which only scans for new messages when you actually open the email app. You can also tweak the push settings to fetch new emails only every hour or so, which is also a big help. You don’t sacrifice timely email updates either, though you’ll still save the most power by disabling push emails altogether. On an Android phone, you can manage the push notification settings for any apps that use it by heading into Settings > Apps and then picking an app and tweaking its individual settings. #3 When background apps are the killer There are other times too when an app is running when you’re not using it and that’s called “Background App Refresh.” There are lots of reasons apps update in the background, like the Music app fetching new playlists, Facebook updating your social feeds, and even Pokemon Go keeping an eye on your steps so you can hatch eggs. It’s all in the name of convenience, but it might also be leaving you with a dead battery halfway through the afternoon. To check out which apps are eating up valuable power in the background go to Settings > Battery and you’ll see a list of the apps taking up your battery life, with the topmost app being the biggest power hog. If you see an app listed with “Background Activity” below it, that’s when you know it’s using power even when you’re not using it. Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter, and streaming apps like Apple Music can be real demons in this department, so head to your Settings > General > Background App Refresh page and toggle off any apps you don’t want working overtime to save some serious juice. #4 Multitasking is OK Do you ever double-tap your home button and see all the apps your iPhone has suspended, waiting for you to go back to them? Whenever I do, I always close them out of instinct, thinking that they must be eating up battery life, right? Nope! In fact, Loveless says that closing apps from the multitasking menu can actually hurt the iPhone’s overall battery life, and for a totally logical reason. Just because you see an app sitting in the multitasking menu doesn’t mean it's actually using your battery life at all — it's just paused, sitting in the phone’s memory and not doing much of anything. When you close it, the phone shuts it down, but when you inevitably open the app back up, it forces your phone to load all that data back up again, and that means it’s using valuable power and ticking down your reserves. Just leave the apps alone and you’ll be doing yourself and your battery a favor. On Android, finding the apps that are running is as easy as pulling the top menu bar down, which brings up a list of the apps either running or paused. You can choose to close them, but again, the idea is that by leaving them on you’re actually saving more power, so just leave them be. #5 Low-power mode can add hours to your battery life Android and iOS both come with low-power features that let you turn off almost all of your phone’s extra features anytime and save tons of energy throughout the day. You can turn it on when the battery drops to 20% or much earlier — by going to Settings > Battery > Low Power Mode and switching it on. On Android, the battery saving feature kicks in automatically if you leave your settings as-is, but you can also manually turn it on by going to Settings > Battery then tap the menu icon and select “Battery Saver.” It can be a real life saver, and it has the bonus benefit of preventing even more battery stress by depleting a dying battery even further than it already is. There are other little things you can do, too, which many other writers have mentioned. But fixing the email and background activity issues on my own phone has already added more than FOUR HOURS of battery life back into my day. That’s nothing short of a miracle in my book. © 2017 USATODAY.COM CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST JOIN THE CONVERSATION To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQs Leave a Comment TRENDING VIDEOS Know your rights on a flight Jax Police searching for person who attacked vet Superintendent Vitti speaks after heading up to Detroit WFAA Breaking News Man pulled off United Airways plane set for Louisville Georgia pastor could spend rest of life in jail Violence erupts at Hemming Park Watch: Tim Tebow goes long again, hitting 2nd homerun in 3 games Orange Bark burglary suspect arrested Orlando area brush fire More Stories On Your Side: 7 things to know about overbooked flights Apr 10, 2017, 11:52 p.m. Superintendent Vitti on leaving for Detroit: I'm… Apr 10, 2017, 11:48 p.m. Mother of deaf protester arrested at Hemming Park… Apr 10, 2017, 10:56 p.m. About Us Contact Us Reporters Index Help Connect With Us FCC Online Public Inspection File • EEO Public File Report Home National Politics Weather 7 Day Forecast Closings & Delays Radars Hurricane Central Conditions Beach Cam More...

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady Apple patent application hints at waterproof next-gen AirPods case capable of charging assorted devices Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Monday, April 10th, 2017, 05:50 Category: AirPods, Hardware, iPad, iPhone, MacBook, Rumor Sometimes it’s the patent applications that offer the most insight. A recently published patent application from Apple highlights the notion of a future AirPods case that could also serve as a wireless charging dock for the iPhone and Apple Watch. The patent application depicts the AirPods charging case doubling as a charger for a variety of products, including the Apple Watch, MacBook, iPhone, and iPad. Apple’s notes within the patent application indicate that the inductive pad could be used to provide “wireless” charging to other devices, as detailed here: “Such devices can include, for example, portable music players (e.g., MP3 devices and Apple’s iPod devices), portable video players (e.g., portable DVD players), cellular telephones (e.g., smart telephones such as Apple’s iPhone devices), video cameras, digital still cameras, projection systems (e.g., holographic projection systems), gaming systems, PDAs, as well as tablet (e.g., Apple’s iPad devices), laptop (e.g. MacBooks) or other mobile computers. Some of these devices can be configured to provide audio, video or other data or sensory output.” The application also details the possibility of a waterproof element to the device, possibly hinting that next-gen AirPods could be waterproof. Granted, there’s a question as to how much power a next-gen AirPods case could hold and what this could be used to charge. Stay tuned for additional details as they become available.

In the patent, Apple has visualized an AirPods case that, when placed flat on a surface, could turn into an Apple Watch charging pad thanks to a "wireless power transmitting component" (via Patently Apple). This would allow the AirPods case to double as a portable charging battery, providing power to both the AirPods internally and a separate device externally. The patent depicts multiple ways for the case to detect if an external device is ready to receive transmitted power, including an optical sensor, a mass sensor, or a mechanical interlock or button. When any of these methods are activated, the case would begin charging the external device, which also could include MacBooks. Image via Patently Apple "Such devices can include, for example, portable music players (e.g., MP3 devices and Apple's iPod devices), portable video players (e.g., portable DVD players), cellular telephones (e.g., smart telephones such as Apple's iPhone devices), video cameras, digital still cameras, projection systems (e.g., holographic projection systems), gaming systems, PDAs, as well as tablet (e.g., Apple's iPad devices), laptop (e.g. MacBooks) or other mobile computers. Some of these devices can be configured to provide audio, video or other data or sensory output." Additionally, a future version of the AirPods case could have an entirely waterproof design, providing even further protection to the AirPods when they're placed within the charging case for long periods of time. Apple's patent depicts ways that the AirPods charging case could have simple water resistance, or could include a full waterproof seal that would be able to survive submersion up to 100 feet for 30 minutes. Apple notes that In various embodiments the liquid-tight seal shall be rated between 3 (spraying water) and 6 (powerful water jets) while in some embodiments the liquid-tight seal shall be rated between 4 (splashing water) and 7 (immersion up to 1 meter). In various embodiments the liquid-tight seal shall be rated between 5 (water jets) and 8 (immersion beyond 1 meter) while in some embodiments liquid-tight shall mean the seal will protect the electronic device against liquid ingress up to 100 feet for 30 minutes. Wireless charging has been rumored for this year's upcoming iPhone 8, which is said to most likely use Apple's in-house wireless charging methods -- like the Apple Watch's inductive charging -- and not an extended-range solution. If the company integrated an inductive charging pad right onto the AirPods case, it would be an interesting mobile solution for users to juice up their Apple Watch or iPhone, but the amount of power that the AirPods charging case could hold remains unclear.

That is the resounding verdict of analysts who were in London on March 29 to see the wraps taken off the highly-anticipated smartphones. Samsung was forced to recall 2.5 million of its Note7 handsets globally in October after several reports of batteries overheating and catching fire. In Q4, Samsung’s shipments only declined by 5.2 per cent to 77.5 million units but this was trumped by its fierce rival Apple, which achieved sales of 78.3 million smartphones. Last month at Mobile World Congress, Samsung UK and Ireland boss Conor Pierce told Mobile News he was confident it could topple its rival in the race for premium smartphone leadership this year. Several leading analysts claim the Galaxy S8 will reverse Samsung’s fortunes this year and help it overhaul Apple and the success it has so far achieved with the iPhone 7. Regaining leadership IDC research director for European mobile devices Francisco Jeronimo claimed it was the “most exciting product from Samsung for many years”. He highlighted the additions of voice assistant Bixby and smart home service Samsung Connect as crucial additions which will help it stand out from its competitors. “The Galaxy S8 is the single most important device in Samsung’s history. The pressure to make it great again runs through every single word of this announcement. “This is the most exciting product from Samsung for many years. The ‘Infinity Display’ makes the Galaxy S8 one of the most attractive devices ever designed. “For the first time, Samsung is unifying its ecosystem in one single place. This is crucial to give customers a better understanding of the power of its global portfolio. “This device can be a game- changer for Samsung. It can help it regain its market leadership and to gain share from Apple in the premium segment. If the Galaxy S8 can’t reverse Samsung’s fortunes in this challenging market, then nothing will.” ‘Monumental fightback’ Canalys analyst Ben Stanton claimed the Galaxy S8 packs enough quality to see the manufacturer recover from the Note7 controversy, claiming it has “upped the ante” and leapfrogged Apple and Huawei in the design stakes. “Samsung has thrown everything at this launch. We’ve seen a radical design, Bixby, developments with the Gear 360 and Gear VR, with the addition of Samsung DeX and Connect. This is a year’s worth of content packed into one launch. “This will help it recover from the Note7 controversy and represents a monumental fightback. “The S7 edge was a quality phone but the S8 has completely upped the ante. Not only is it head and shoulders above Apple, it has leapfrogged the likes of the Huawei P10 with its design, premium look and feel.” CCS Insight chief of research Ben Wood claimed the S8 “breaks design boundaries” that can enhance Samsung’s position. “In a market where consumers are becoming numb to indistinguishable smartphone launches, Samsung has redefined expectations with the S8. “It is arguably the most important launch of the last 10 years for Samsung and every aspect will be under the microscope following the Note7 recall. “The S8 is unquestionably a strong product but Samsung must now deliver a faultless launch to move on from the difficulties of 2017. If this happens,it will emerge in an even stronger position. Reversal of fortunes GfK director of technology Imran Choudhary claimed the devices have met the high expectations of it, and bring into question Apple design leadership with its iPhones. “These devices give Samsung the best chance of reversing their fortunes following on from the Note7. In years gone by, the latest iPhone was deemed to have the best design but Samsung’s latest devices certainly brings that into question. “It sets up an interesting couple of months ahead until we see what arrives later in the year from the others.” TAGS Ben Stanton Ben Wood CCS Insigh Canalys Francisco Jeronimo GfK IDC Research Imran Choudhary Samsung analyst s8 SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleGartner: Consumer spending on devices to grow 2pc in 2017 Next articleDistribution shake up: Brightstar and Data Select sales bosses depart Paul Withers http://www.mobilenewscwp.co.uk RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR Bullish Plan.com launches “game changing” V4 partner portal Distribution shake up: Brightstar and Data Select sales bosses depart Gartner: Consumer spending on devices to grow 2pc in 2017 NO COMMENTS LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply The leading news source for the mobile communications industry 8-10 Godson Street Islington London N1 9GZ Editorial Team Telephone: 020 7278 0795 Email: editorial@mobilenewscwp.co.uk Advertising Kimberley Glover - 020 3122 0871 Stephen Watson - 020 3122 0872 POPULAR POSTS Reaction: Can Huawei really overtake Apple and Samsung?

Jay Z has pulled some of his music from Spotify... Business & Tech 11:55 10 Apr 2017 Jessica Kelly 20 hours ago Jay Z has pulled some of his music from Spotify. Fans will now have to use Tidal to listen to the artist and businessman, whose real name is Shawn Carter. While this makes business sense for Carter, what does it mean for us, the consumer? In short, it means another headache.  Already, fans are having to compromise on what they listen to and when because of artists deals and subscribers perks. There is no question but that the music industry is struggling to exist in the digital age. Rather than arriving at a solution, however, it seems we the consumer are being punished. At this moment in time, there is no one streaming service that will offer me - a consumer with a mixed taste in music - exactly what I want. As a result, I pay €10 a month to Spotify, €10 a month to Apple Music and also have certain albums saved to my phone, synced on iTunes. I also purchased Beyonce’s Lemonade from the iTunes store because it’s not available to stream, despite paying for a monthly account.  It is, for want of a better phrase, a pain in the face. Having used Apple Music, Spotify and Tidal over the last few months, I’ve come to the conclusion that there’s no perfect music management system out there. If you have suggestions, however, please do let me know! Spotify - €9.99 / month Spotify was the first service I subscribed to way back in 2013. I still pay €10 a month and really like the service overall. The user interface is nice to navigate through and creating playlists could not be easier. Some of the “Made For You” playlists can be good, but I’ve found them to be rather hit and miss. All in all, it's a pleasant experience and remains my favourite of the streaming services for now.  While Spotify does not have many 'exclusive' deals with artists, it was recently announced that under the new agreement, Spotify will restrict new albums from Universal artists to premium subscribers for up to two weeks. Apple Music - €9.99 Apple is a giant in every way. The company evolved from a product manufacturer to a key player in the music industry. iTunes has grown to be more than just a music library, it's now a store and the company also has its streaming component, Apple Music.  Apple has rocked the boat a number of times and has a number of 'exclusives' including Taylor Swift's 1989 album. Swift has also appeared in ads for the company, as has Drake.  From a user's point of view, the interface looks nice but can be quite slow to react. I often find there is a 2 or 3 second lag from when I tap on a song to when it begins to play. This is even when I'm in a 4G area or on strong wifi.   The stand-out feature of Apple Music for me is the recommended playlists within the 'For You' section. From new music to throwback playlists, I'm never bored! Tidal - €9.99 After a solid 23 minutes of looking, I finally figured out how to cancel my Tidal account last year. Everything about the service annoyed me from the outset. Do you remember the launch party?  While I didn't like the look of it from the outset, I subscribed to ensure I was giving it a fair chance. It's important to note that the interface is quite nice, but I found it is not as intuitive as Spotify and Apple Music. This is how the web browser looks.  Tidal has a number of exclusive deals with the likes of Jay Z, Beyonce and Kanye, all of whom own a part of the company. They offer a premium subscription, which just gets rid of the ads but also provides a HiFI option. This is €10 more expensive and streams the music in a higher quality.  To my humble ears, I did not hear an astounding difference that warrants €20 a month.      11:55 10 Apr 2017 Jessica Kelly 20 hours ago 3 Related articles Chromecast: The best piece of tech you can buy for less than €40 Spotify Premium users will get some albums two weeks before others Is 'WhatsApp Pay' on the way? news cards #Trump100 most popular latest sport #PornWeek: The A to Z - by way of XXX - of pornography PICTURES: New-look Luas map revealed Arsene Wenger: "I’m disappointed and determined to put things right" Crystal Palace leave Arsenal Top 4 hopes in tatters site terms privacy advertise with us contact competitions apps appliancesdelivered.ie © Copyright 2015 - Newstalk Ltd.

Initially, speculations were such that the new red colour iPhones will only be available in Apple and other high-street stores in India. Well, that's not the case any longer. As Apple now decides to sell the red colour iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in other popular online and offline stores in India as well. The iPhone is listed for pre-orders in official Croma website.

Exactly like it was in other countries. To recall, red colour iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are already up for sale in a few countries like - US, Australia, China, Canada, the UK and the mainland Europe, and will be made available in over 40 countries.

Well, as this is Apples first attempt to bring the red colour variant device, the company might roll out only a limited number of units initially.

IMG relies upon Apple for half of its income, so as the news broke its shares nosedived, settling at a price below half their value compared to the previous trading day. In a statement published on that terrible day for Imagination Technologies, you could read of the disbelief that Apple could design a brand new GPU architecture without infringing on IMG's intellectual property rights. Imagination Technologies has been licensing its GPU technology to Apple for a decade and has been raking in upwards of £60 million per annum from Apple's royalty payments. However, Apple indicated that it wants 'more control' over its products by using in-house technology for graphic processing. This weekend The Daily Telegraph noted that "just days after pulling the plug on Imagination Technologies," Apple has embarked upon a GPU engineer hiring spree for its 'UK design centre'. Around a dozen jobs have been posted for graphics architecture design and support, and The Telegraph reckons that "Imagination’s current employees are likely to be a key target". A little bit of LinkedIn profile digging reveals that Apple has hired at least 25 former Imagination staff over the last two years, mainly deployed now at its San Francisco and London offices. Notably, Imagination's former COO, John Metcalfe, was one of those successfully head-hunted 10 months ago. You can see a section of Metcalfe's profile below, in which he highlights that "we are hiring". Apple expects to completely remove any reliance upon (and thus royalty payments for) Imagination Technologies GPU IP within the next two years.

Which is best, Apple Watch or Fitbit tracker? By Simon Jary | 10 Apr 17 Want an activity tracker but can’t decide whether to buy a Fitbit wristband or fork out for the rather lovely Apple Watch? We pit Apple Watch vs Fitbit to see which comes out best on various aspects: fitness tracking, heart rate monitoring, design, price, apps, battery life, and so on. Fitbit doesn’t actually label its wristbands as smartwatches. The closest it gets is calling its Surge device a “superwatch”, and the Blaze as a "Fitness Watch". Otherwise the correct term is activity trackers. Fitbits don’t run multiple apps like a smartwatch, but they are directly comparable on many of their fitness-measuring functions, design themes and functions. As a direct comparison we’ll look at the Apple Watch vs the Fitbit Alta, Fitbit Charge 2, Fitbit Blaze and Fitbit Surge. The Fitbit Flex 2 is the cheapest wristband but has a far more minimal display screen, and no watch function. See also: Which Fitbit is best and Apple Watch Buying Guide   Activity tracking Keeping fit doesn’t mean you have to be a gym freak or marathon runner. Keeping active throughout the day offers real health benefits too, and both the Apple Watch and Fitbit activity trackers are superb at getting you moving more. The Apple Watch and Fitbit activity trackers measure steps taken, distance travelled and calories burned. They also show you how many minutes you’ve been active during the day. Each tracks your progress over time and can store historical data, and you set daily goals for yourself. The accuracy of the trackers is probably less important than how they show your trend of activity and performance against user-set goals. In addition, the Fitbit wristbands (excluding the Flex 2 and Alta) have an altimeter that counts distance climbed (take the hilly route home, not the flat one). The Fitbits also sync weight data from the optional Fitbit Aria scales. As a result the Fitbit models range from everyday fitness and active fitness (like the Apple Watch) and further to sports and performance fitness – with the Surge supporting running, cross-training, biking, strength and cardio workouts. Serious runners have dismissed the Apple Watch for their needs, preferring the Surge or other dedicated running watches from the Garmin or Suunto. But that looks change with the release of the Series 2 Apple Watch, which features a built-in GPS just like the Fitbit Surge. Fitness is obviously at the core of the Fitbits, whereas the Apple Watch counts activity tracking as one of its many features. The Apple Watch offers two main fitness apps: Activity, which is all about health, movement, wellness and your daily routine; and Workout App, which tracks running, cycling and walking. All this data is collected on your iPhone via the Activity app, although users can get a more holistic view of their health by using the Health app, which integrates data from multiple sources, not only the Watch. While they work brilliantly with the iPhone, Fitbits do not officially support Apple’s Health Kit, although integration is offered by third-party apps. You can see at a glance how far you are with your daily movement and health goals by looking at the Apple Watch’s colourful three rings, which light up to show your progress. The Move ring shows calories burned. The Exercise ring displays how many minutes of brisk activity you’ve achieved. And the Stand ring shows how often you’ve stood up to stop sitting down. The aim is to complete each rung every day. It’s a great motivation tool. Apple defines exercise as any activity that’s equivalent to at least a brisk walk. The Watch looks at your heart rate and movement data, so just going for a walk might not move that green ring as much as you’d think. It wants you to get your heart pumping a bit faster. The Apple Watch learns your habits so will push you harder the more active you get over time. We love the Apple Watch’s ping to remind you if you’ve been sitting around too long – time to stretch the legs and get the heart rate up for a bit, or at least stand up. Basically it’s a get-off-your-arse alert, from the taptic pulses to your wrist to notifications, that you’ve been idle for a long period of time. You can actually get an alert even when standing up because what the Watch is actually measuring is your lack of moving about. Fitbit's Reminders To Move work in the same way, and are found on the Alta, Charge 2 and Flex 2. The Apple Workout app gives you real-time stats for exercise time, distance walked/run, calories burned and pace, but at the moment it relies on third-party apps to make it a proper sports tracker, and until the release of the Series 2 Watch we didn’t find the Workout app accurate enough for running (see below in our GPS comparison). The lack of built-in GPS (see below) puts the Series 1 Apple Watch behind the Fitbit Surge in this regard, but the Series 2 Apple Watch is now a real contender. The Watch's compatibility with some excellent third-party running apps improves on some of these initial failings. Read next: Fitbit Charge 2 review   Heart rate monitor The Apple Watch and Fitbit Charge 2, Blaze and Surge use something called photoplethysmography to measure your heart rate. This uses safe green LED lights on the underside of the wristband to detect blood volume and capillary-size changes under pressure. When your heart beats, your capillaries expand and contract based on blood volume changes. The LED lights reflect onto the skin to detect blood volume changes. Blood is red because it reflects red light and absorbs green light. When your heart beats, the blood flow in your wrist – and the green light absorption – is greater. The Fitbit Charge 2, Surge and Blaze monitor your heart rate continuously, 24/7. They can store heart rate data at 1-second intervals during exercise tracking and at 5-second intervals all other times. See New Fitbit trackers rumours and release date. On the other hand (or should I say wrist?) the Apple Watch checks your heart rate only every ten minutes during the day. However, it does record your heart rate continuously when the Workout app is turned on, so you get constant feedback during training sessions. The Watch’s built-in heart-rate monitor does support external heart-rate monitors too. The Apple Watch impressed the testers at US Consumer Reports: “We pitted the Apple Watch against our highest-rated heart-rate monitor. Wearing both, our testers hit the treadmill – first walking slowly, then a little faster, then a jog back to a walk.” The test found “no significant differences” between Apple Watch and the dedicated heart-rate monitor, with both reporting similar readings. >> Read on… Pages 1 2 3 4 Tags: Smart Home, Gadgets, Wearable Tech Share this article Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi.

By Susie Ochs Executive Editor, Macworld | Apr 10, 2017 3:45 AM PT Credit: Apple More like this Apple's new iPad lineup slashes prices, the iPad Air, and iPad mini storage... iPad Pro, iPad, and iPad mini 4: What are the differences? The $329 iPad could be just the thing for the education market Video The iPhone Show: What's new in iOS 10.3? At a Glance iPad (2017) Macworld Rating $329.00 MSRP $329.00 View on Apple Amazon sells a Kids Edition of its Fire tablet, which is the exact same tablet they sell for adults, but in a kid-friendly case, with a year’s worth of the FreeTime Unlimited service for kids apps and content. Apple does not do this. But at $329 for 32GB of storage, the new iPad is pretty close. This is a great iPad at its most family-friendly price, and certainly a better buy for kids than the $599 iPad Pro. Now, obviously you won’t get all the same features or technology that’s in the more expensive iPad Pro. The new 2017 iPad is more or less a mashup of parts we’ve seen before: the same A9 chip that powers the iPhone 6s, the same size and weight as the first iPad Air (minus the physical lock switch, sadly), and the same camera as the iPad Air 2. This is more of a throwback than a brand-new product, kind of the iPad equivalent of the iPhone SE. And you know what? That’s fine with me. Now that the iPad has been around a while, and we’ve seen what the use cases are and how long they tend to last, a low-cost, full-size iPad is just what the lineup needed. Deja view Apple An iPad is basically a screen you hold in your hands, so the screen quality is important, and Apple didn’t skimp on this one. First of all, it’s plenty bright. Apple says it tops out at 500 nits, thanks to a stronger backlight, which is the same brightness as the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, and 25 percent brighter than the iPad Air 2. It can still be tricky to see in the very brightest sunlight, but overall you can notice the improvement. The 9.7-inch iPad Pro has the P3 color gamut as well as SRGB, and iOS manages the colors so you always see the most accurate image. The same iPad Pro also has True Tone, which further adjusts the display to match the color temperature of the room’s lighting. This new iPad has neither of those: no True Tone (although it does have Night Shift), and just SRGB color. But since those features are available on the higher-end tablet, it makes sense to cut them from the lower-cost model—they’re nice-to-haves, not need-to-haves, and I haven’t missed them when using the new iPad in a variety of lighting situations. The new iPad also lacks Apple Pencil support, the iPad Pro’s four-speaker setup, as well as the Smart Connector. Again, I don’t miss them much. The iPad gets loud enough to watch movies and TV and enjoy music without relying on headphones or a Bluetooth speaker, even if the sound doesn’t have all the gravitas of the iPad Pro’s. Yes, it has a headphone jack, and let’s pray that iPads always will. Under the hood Apple The main reason the new iPad is nearly as good as the iPad Pro is how well it runs the thousands of iPad apps. The A9 chip is the third generation of the 64-bit A-series chips, and it also brings a better image signal processor and more accurate M9 motion coprocessor than the iPad Air 2’s A8X. Apple says the new chip is more battery efficient, plus the new iPad has a slightly larger battery than its predecessor. (The battery is 32.9 watt-hours, the same as the first iPad Air. The slimmer iPad Air 2 shaved the battery down to 27.6, and interestingly, the 9.7-inch iPad Pro’s battery is 27.9.) I had no trouble beating Apple’s 10-hour estimate consistently, with one video-streaming test stretching to 12 hours, 44 minutes. The iPad starts up quickly, unlocks in a flash with the speedy Touch ID button, and runs heavy apps like Pixelmator, Lightroom, and GarageBand with no sweat. It scored 2251 in Geekbench 4.1’s single-core CPU test, and 4417 in the multicore CPU test, putting it right between the iPad Air 2 and the iPad Pro in terms of performance—right where you’d expect. The 8-megapixel rear-facing iSight camera, and the front-facing 1.2-megapixel camera aren’t changed from the iPad Air 2, but the coprocessor that controls them—the image signal processor—is. Like the iPhone 7, the iPad’s ISP assembles multiple frames each time you take a photo, which should reduce noise and give you a sharper, clearer result. I don’t take a lot of pictures with my iPad—I’m more likely to have my iPhone handy when a photo opportunity strikes—but a good camera is still important for video chatting, augmented reality, and creative fun like stop-motion animation or Apple’s new Clips app. Oh, and the camera sits flush with the back of the iPad, unlike the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, which has a slight camera bulge. iPad, iPad Pro, or iPad mini? Apple Which iPad should you buy? The iPad mini is still around, but down to one SKU, 128GB of storage for $399. So if that’s the size you like, this feels like a “now or never” moment. It’s got an A8 chip, which is 64-bit, so it should support iOS updates for a while, although it seems a given that Apple would stop supporting the iPad mini before the A9-equipped 2017 iPad. In fact, Apple didn’t even give this iPad mini a new generation number: It’s the same fourth-generation iPad mini first introduced in the fall of 2015. You just get more storage for your $399: now 128GB, up from the 16GB it launched with in 2015 or the 32GB it was bumped up to in 2016. So if you need tons of storage, you’ll save a little bit opting for the 128GB iPad mini 4 for $399, instead of the 128GB iPad for $429. But since that $30 difference gets you a bigger iPad with a newer processor, I don’t think the iPad mini 4 will be overwhelmingly popular. It feels like a clearance product. If you’re trying to choose between this $329 9.7-inch iPad and the $599 9.7-inch iPad Pro, there are a couple factors to consider. If you know you want the Apple Pencil or Apple’s Smart Keyboard, you’ll need the Pro of course. But there are capable third-party alternatives for both of those accessories that would work with the regular iPad, like Adobe’s lovely Ink stylus and Logitech’s Bluetooth keyboard cases. For me, the value of a $329 iPad outweighs the novelty of the Apple Pencil or Smart Keyboard. Add cellular for $130 more, and you’re still spending less than you would on the Wi-Fi-only iPad Pro. However, if you intend to do real work on your tablet day in and day out—treating it like a laptop—you might want to future-proof your investment a little by selecting an iPad Pro with the more advanced A10X chip, or even waiting a bit to see if and how Apple refreshes the iPad Pro lineup this year. Apple Bottom line This iPad is great for families, schools, businesses looking for a point-of-sale system, and just anyone who wants a workhorse of an iPad without the bells and whistles of the more expensive iPad Pro. It’s everything great about the iPad at a lower cost to entry than ever, and if your kids are as nuts about the iPad as mine is, this is the one to get them.

Britta O'Boyle10 April 2017Tablets Apple / Pocket-lint Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment Apple announced a new 9.7-inch iPad at its March 2017 event, replacing the iPad Air 2, but ditching the Air name. The Apple iPad (2017) is the cheapest way to get your hands on an Apple tablet, but how does it compare to the rest of the iPad family? We've put it up against the iPad Air 2 in a separate feature, and you can also read our entire iPad round up if you want to see how it fits in on the whole. Here we are specifically comparing it to the iPad Pro 9.7. New Apple iPad (2017) review Apple iPad Pro 9.7 review New Apple iPad 2017 vs iPad Pro 9.7: Design Similar designs, but iPad Pro is lighter and slimmer Smart Connector and raised rear camera lens on iPad Pro iPad Pro comes in additional rose gold colour option The new Apple iPad 2017 and the iPad Pro 9.7 feature a very similar design with only a few slight differences on the surface. They are both distinctly iPad, offering slim, premium metal constructions with rounded edges and corners and the Touch ID home button on the front beneath the screen. On the rear, the Apple logo is positioned in the middle, as usual, while the rear camera lens sits in the top left corner. The iPad Pro 9.7 has a raised rear camera lens and a flash module beneath it, while the new iPad has a flat rear camera lens and no flash. Both have a centralised Lightning port at the bottom in between grilles but the iPad Pro has Smart Connector ports on one of its sides, distinguishing it from the new model in terms of design. These two slabs offer identical measurements in terms of width and height, at 240 x 169.5mm, but the iPad Pro 9.7 is slimmer at 6.1mm compared to 7.5mm. The Pro is also lighter at 437g or 444g compared to the new model's 469g or 478g weight, depending on the whether you opt for Wi-Fi or Wi-Fi and Cellular. The new Apple iPad 2017 and the iPad Pro 9.7 both come in silver, space grey and gold colour options, but the iPad Pro is also available in rose gold and it is the only iPad in the family that comes in this colour. New Apple iPad 9.7 vs iPad Air 2: What's the difference? New Apple iPad 2017 vs iPad Pro 9.7: Display Both 9.7-inch displays, 2048 x 1538 resolutions (264ppi) iPad Pro has fully laminated display with anti-reflective coating iPad Pro also has wider colour gamut and True Tone technology  The new Apple iPad 2017 and the iPad Pro 9.7 both offer 9.7-inch Retina displays, which means LED-backlit LCD screens with 2048 x 1536 resolutions for pixel densities of 264ppi. They also both have a fingerprint resistance oleophobic coating, but this is where their similarities conclude. The iPad Pro 9.7 has a fully laminated display with an anti-reflective coating, while the new iPad doesn't, meaning there is a small gap between the surface glass and the display panel of the new iPad and the reason for the increased thickness. In reality, it doesn't actually make a great deal of difference other than content isn't as close to the surface, but the colours of the new iPad are still vibrant and natural so the experience is still a great one. The iPad Pro 9.7 also offers a P3 wide colour gamut and Apple's True Tone technology, the latter of which adjusts the white balance based on ambient lighting conditions and is the most obvious difference between the screens of these two devices. The new iPad does have iOS Night Shift however, which like the iPhones, reduces the blue light emitted from the screen to help relax your eyes when you're off to bed. What is Apple's True Tone display? New Apple iPad 2017 vs iPad Pro 9.7: Camera iPad Pro has 12MP rear, 5MP front cameras New iPad has 8MP rear, 1.2MP front cameras iPad Pro has rear True Tone Flash, front Retina Flash, 4K video recording and Live Photo feature  The new Apple iPad 2017 has an 8-megapixel rear camera with a f/2.4 aperture and 1080p video recording capabilities, while the front-facing camera resolution sits at 1.2-megapixels. There is no flash on either camera. The iPad Pro 9.7 on the other hand, has a 12-megapixel rear camera with a f/2.2 aperture and 4K video recording, along with a 5-megapixel front-facing snapper. It also offers Live Photos, wide colour photo capture, a True Tone on its rear camera and a Retina Flash on its front snapper. Other camera features are the same across both devices though, with both offering Auto HDR photos, exposure control, face detection, burst mode, timer mode and photo geotagging, all of which are also offered on the company's iPhones. Which iPad is best for you? New Apple iPad 2017 vs iPad Pro 9.7: Hardware iPad Pro has faster chip, but both have 10-hour battery life iPad Pro comes in 256GB storage option iPad Pro compatible with Smart Keyboard and Apple Pencil The new Apple iPad 2017 comes with the A9 chip and embedded M9 coprocessor, which is said offer 1.6x faster CPU and 1.8x faster GPU compared to the A8 chip, used in the Apple iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 4. The iPad Pro 9.7 has a slightly more advanced A9X chip with embedded M9 coprocessor though, said to have a 1.85x faster CPU and 2.7x faster GPU to the A8. The iPad Pro 9.7 also offers Apple Pencil and Smart Keyboard compatibility, which the new iPad doesn't making it less of a working-on-the-go tablet compared to the Pro device. There is also four-speaker audio on the iPad Pro, compared to two-speaker audio on the new iPad, though pretty much everything else is the same in terms of hardware. Both the iPad Pro 9.7 and the new iPad are said to offer up to 10 hours battery life, which in our experience is fairly accurate, and they both come in 32GB and 128GB storage options. The iPad Pro is also available in a 256GB option, which the new iPad is not.  New Apple iPad 2017 vs iPad Pro 9.7: Software Both run on iOS 10 Both the new Apple iPad 2017 and the iPad Pro 9.7 run on iOS 10, meaning you'll get an almost identical experience across both devices, aside from a few extra features on the iPad Pro. You will however get functions such as split-screen multi-tasking, the new Home app for any HomeKit-enabled devices you might have, iMessages and of course the richness of the App Store ecosystem. Apple iOS 10 tips and tricks New Apple iPad 2017 vs iPad Pro 9.7: Price iPad (2017) starting price is £210 cheaper The new Apple iPad 2017 starts at £339 for the 32GB Wi-Fi only option, stretching up to £559 for the 128GB Wi-Fi and Cellular model.  The Apple iPad Pro 9.7 starts at £549 for the 32GB Wi-Fi only option, while the 256GB Wi-Fi and Cellular option will cost you £849. New Apple iPad 2017 vs iPad Pro 9.7: Which should you buy? The decision between the new Apple iPad 2017 and the iPad Pro 9.7 will come down to what you want your new iPad for, as well as what you're willing, or what you have, to spend on it.  The iPad Pro 9.7 offers a better screen, more advanced chipset, the option of more storage, better cameras and it is also compatible with the Smart Keyboard and Apple Pencil, both of which mean it is a great tablet for working-on-the-go, whether sketching or typing. The iPad Pro also offers better audio. The new iPad 2017 is significantly cheaper though and although it doesn't match the iPad Pro in terms of specs, it's still a brilliant tablet that offers a solid, consistent performance. It will be more than enough for some, while others will want the extra functionality that comes with the iPad Pro. The question you really have to ask yourself is, are those extra functions worth £200 to you?

This product fills a gap in existing offerings by providing bands with black latching pins rather than the silver pins available on other bands. The initial line of ToneBands comes in three colors: white, gray and lavender. All three colors come with black latching pins to match Space Gray / Space Black watches. These bands are the culmination of six months of work from company cofounders Cameron Banga, who lives in Valparaiso, Indiana and Jonathon Becker, who lives in St. Louis, Missouri. "Both Cameron and I are pretty big Apple nerds" explained Jonathon. "We started ToneBands because we were both bugged by the same little thing. We both had black (or what Apple calls "Space Gray") Apple Watches but every band sold, either by Apple or third parties, had a silver latching pin. We couldn't find any bands with black latch pins that would match our watches." They found they weren't alone, as they found an audience documenting their progress online through a podcast called "Making the Bands." "We've never done anything like this before, and we thought other people might find it useful to listen to us stumble through the process," said Banga. "It's been a longer journey to get here than we thought, but we're really proud of our final product." In the future, ToneBands hopes to expand into offering a wider variety of colors and styles, and to expand into other colored pins as well. Pricing and Availability: The bands retail for $18 individually, or $39 (USD) for a three-pack and are now available for purchase and are shipping world-wide. For more information, please contact Cameron Banga. ToneBands Spring 2017 Lineup Media Assets ToneBands is an Apple Watch accessories company headquartered in Valparaiso, Indiana. It was cofounded in September, 2016 by Cameron Banga, a mobile applications developer from Valparaiso and Jonathon Becker, a digital marketing owner from St. Louis, Missouri.

In fact earlier this year there were signs that Apple was dropping support for 32-bit apps, but now a new report claims that with iOS 11, Apple will be dropping support completely. This is according to a series of tweets by developer Steve Troughton-Smith who claims to have heard that iOS 11 won’t have 32-bit app support at all. This means that if developers do not update their apps to 64-bit by then, their apps will no longer be usable on iOS. Apple have been issuing warnings that read, “This app will not work with future versions of iOS. The developer of this app needs to update it to improve its compatibility.” Last month analytics firm Sensor Tower suggested that Apple’s move to 64-bit could end up obsoleting about 200,000 apps in the process. However we suppose this is just the natural progression of things and we reckon that for the most part, most of the major apps have already been updated already. It’s probably legacy apps and apps that have been abandoned/forgotten that will end up being affected by this, but either way hopefully developers who have yet to update their apps will do so. (…and it sounds like future A-series chips won’t even include 32-bit support. Wonder if that’ll free up any performance/die space?) — Steve T-S (@stroughtonsmith) April 8, 2017 Filed in Apple >Cellphones >Rumors. Read more about Apps, iOS.

By Laura Sydell • 22 hours ago TweetShareGoogle+Email Listen Listening... / It's daunting to think about the number of products Apple has created that have transformed how most people use technology: the original Mac with the first mass-produced mouse, the iMac, the iPod, the iPhone, the iPad. But fast-forward to 2017, and it appears that a lot of innovation is coming from other companies. Amazon has a hit with its Echo, a speaker device that responds to voice commands. Reviewers say Microsoft's Surface competes with the Mac. And now, Samsung's Galaxy S8 smartphone is getting raves because of its battery life and high-end screen. Both Apple fans and analysts who follow the company are beginning to wonder whether Apple has lost its mojo. All those innovations happened when Steve Jobs, Apple's co-founder, was running the company. And some former employees say a cultural shift occurred at Apple after Jobs died in 2011. One of those former employees is Bob Burrough, a software engineer and a manager who worked on the team that helped create the iPhone. He says under Jobs, every employee was encouraged to take personal responsibility for improving the products. "It was all about we're all working towards the same goal," Burrough says. "We're all working on the same product and if there's something that you see that needs to get done you basically just stepped in and took care of it." Burrough shares an example. He worked on the iPod nano. Just as they were about to ship the first units, Burrough realized that 2,000 of them had been left running, draining the batteries. "I told the distribution center, 'Look, you need to go pull them back out of the box, shut them down and make sure that the batteries are fully charged when they come out of the box to go into the customer's hand for the very first time,' " Burrough says. But he argues the culture at Apple changed when Tim Cook took over as CEO. Burrough says employees were getting the message to look down and do their jobs. Burrough says that when he saw something wrong, "the way that I was expected to deal with it was shut my mouth and do my job, and take care of whatever my assigned responsibility was and (not) worry about what anybody else is doing." Burrough, who left Apple in 2014, thinks the culture shift has affected the products because employees feel less invested. Bryson Gardner has similar memories. He worked at Apple for nearly a decade and was one of the team leaders for iPod and iPhone development. Gardner says Jobs liked debate about how to make products better — and his style was to listen and then make a decision. "His clarity of vision was very effective," Gardner says. "It actually made my job very easy in retrospect." Cook is a more traditional CEO, Gardner says, and doesn't like people arguing — instead, typically bringing together top managers and building consensus rather than letting them debate it out until he makes a decision. Apple has entered one new product category under Cook. It released the Apple Watch. But it was late to the wearables game and Apple has yet to release figures on sales of the Watch. It has also introduced Apple Pay and thumbprint security. But many analysts don't think these compare to previous innovations. Gardner thinks, in some ways, Apple is a victim of its own success. And he thinks even Jobs may have had a harder time being innovative under the weight of the iPhone, which now brings in 70 percent of Apple's revenue. "Looking historically at Apple, there was more equal importance across a lot of the product lines and more opportunity to push into new spaces," Gardner says. But now, "one of the challenges is how do you manage the iPhone in relation to all the other technologies that you could be doing?" To Forrester Research analyst James McQuivey, Apple risks going down the same path as Sony, which used to be seen as the high-end and most innovative tech company. It once dominated the market for portable music players. "As recently as 2000 people were still talking about the Walkman and what a big innovation that was," McQuivey says. "Well, you don't hear people talk about Sony like that anymore." Of course, it took a long time for Sony to lose its reputation for innovation, McQuivey says, and Apple's place as an innovator isn't likely to go away tomorrow. In fact, a lot of people are rooting for the company, including former employees Burrough and Gardner. "Like many other customers, I would like them to make more things," Gardner says. "It would be great to have something else people lined up around the block for" besides the iPhone. But, for now, the iPhone is still a product that a lot of people love. Enough for Apple to still be the most valuable company in the world. Copyright 2017 NPR. To see more, visit http://www.npr.org/.

By Alistair Charlton April 10, 2017 11:21 BST iPhone 8 Plus render shows what the new handset might look likeConceptsiPhone YouTube Will the new iPhone be delayed or not? It's a question which pops up every year without fail, but is almost impossible to answer fully. For 2016 the iPhone 7 Plus, especially in the new Jet Black colour option, was delayed for over a month in some cases – and now for 2017 the same could be true of the iPhone 8. For its 10th year, Apple is expected to give the iPhone a major facelift in 2017. As well as launching updated versions of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus (likely called the 7S and 7S Plus), Apple is tipped to be preparing an all-new model. It is claimed this phone will have a large, curved screen with almost no bezels, similar to the Samsung Galaxy S8. But, unfortunately, it is this all-new iPhone which will be difficult to buy on launch day. With its new design and large 5.8in display, it could also be the most popular among consumers. Just as how the iPhone 7 Plus in its new Jet Black colour was near-impossible to find in stock on release day in 2017, the same is expected to be true of the new model – and stock shortages could stretch from September all the way to Christmas. A new research note written by Apple analyst Brian White and published by MacRumors states: "Our contact strongly believes the 5.8in iPhone 8 will be delayed by several weeks due to challenges around the 3D sensing technology, but still in time for the December holidays. This is not the first time that we've heard about a potential delay with a new iPhone; however, our contact was so emphatic about the delay that we are taking this data point more seriously." But it is still early days for the iPhone 8, which is yet to be seen in the flesh by any of the usual smartphone leakers and rumour mills. White adds: "Since it is only April, this situation could improve. Essentially, our contact believes customers will be able to pre-order the new 5.8in iPhone 8 along with the new 4.7in and 5.5in iPhones in September; however, the 5.8in iPhone 8 will not be available for delivery until several weeks later." As for the "3D sensing technology" blamed for causing the delays, this is believed to be a new front-facing camera. By combining the existing camera with an infrared transmitter and receiver, the new iPhone is said to offer iris and facial recognition as an alternative to using a PIN, password or fingerprint to unlock the handset.

Tech Apple Science Cars Samsung Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES     2017 IMac Aimed At Professionals Says Apple Posted: Apr 10 2017, 10:00am CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, in News | Apple     This is exciting. Apple executive confirm new iMac for this Fall that will appeal to Pro users. It totally makes sense to change the target market for the iMac towards professional users. Average consumers do their digital tasks on laptops, tablets and smartphones and do not need desktop computers anymore. Don't Miss: Find a Nintendo NES Classic in stock Lots of professional users like though to work on a big screen with an all-in-one design to avoid clutter. Apple executives have confirmed that the 2017 iMac comes later this year. Speaking to a small group of journalists last week,  Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing Phil Schiller said according to TechCrunch that the improved iMacs will appeal to a segment of Pro users, as well. Apple did not give any specifics about the new 2017 iMac with pro appeal. A blog focused on Apple updates, followed up with a rumor what the new iMac would run on unreleased Intel Xeon Intel E3-1285 v6 processor. Customers could opt to upgrade the RAM to 64GB of ECC memory. Xeon CPUs are Intel's chips for small business servers, entry workstations, powerful mobile workstations, storage servers, cloud workstations/media transcode, and edge computing/IoT. The 2017 iMac is also supposed to feature faster NVMe SSD’s, up to 2TB. The AMD graphics to support would enable virtual reality. Thunderbolt 3 and USB-C gen 2 are the new ports on the iMac. As rumored before the new iMac could come with new keyboard with touch bar. Pike's Alpha's iMac 2017 specs rumor sounds a bit too like wishful thinking. An iMac with 64GB that has the graphics power to run a HTC Vive definitely sounds what I would buy. The blog report also mentions that the release of the 2017 iMac is in October. The report did not mention the screen resolution of the 2017 iMac. While 8K displays are available now, the prices are still extremely high. It is likely that the new iMac sticks to 5K Retina displays. Read the 2017 iMac report to find out everything that is known so far about the next iMac. The main topic of the small press conference was the Mac Pro. Apple tried to explained why it failed and that they work on a new Mac Pro that will coming 2018. Apple also confirmed to offer again a stand alone Apple Display.  Apple's Federighi spelled out again to journalists that Apple keeps on focusing on the Mac. "The Mac is — we say it over and over, we’re saying it again here — a huge part of our future, we’re deeply invested in it." Read more Apple News. This story may contain affiliate links.

Tech Apple Science Cars Samsung Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES     2017 IMac: Rumors, Features, Release, Price And Everything You Need To Know Posted: Mar 27 2017, 1:22am CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, Updated: Apr 10 2017, 2:31am CDT, in News | Apple     Apple is expected to release a new iMac in 2017. The last time Apple updated the iMac was in 2015. Apple executives have confirmed that a new iMac will be released later this year. The 2017 iMac could to unveiled early as the WWDC 2017 in June. On April 4, Apple's Phil Schiller told a small group of journalists that a new iMac is coming and will also appeal to professional users. Don't Miss: This is How to Find a Nintendo Switch in Stock Apple has been under fire for neglecting the desktop for a while now. The official confirmation that a 2017 iMac helps to give iMac users confidence again that new hardware is coming. Microsoft used Apple's moment of weakness in a perfect way. The Surface Studio makes the iMac look like ancient technology. Microsoft in a way is helping Apple iMac fans to get a new iMac sooner than later. The new 2017 iMac needs to be innovative in design and functionality to match Microsoft's stunning device. 2017 iMac Features We can take some pointers from the new MacBook Pro that Apple release end of 2016. Apple might introduce the Touch Bar in the 2017 iMac. Apple has patented the integration of the OLED touch screen on standalone keyboards. LG already said in 2015 that Apple is coming out with an iMac featuring an Retina 8K display. This of course did not happen. One thing that Apple is fond of is though resolution. An iMac Retina 8K is technically possible. The 8K resolution would also allow Apple to give the iMac a bigger screen option. How does a 34" iMac with 8K Display, Core i7 sound? The new iMac will adopt USB-C like the MacBook Pro. This change requires to get new adapters for your peripherals and has already caused a ruckus at the launch of the 2016 MacBook Pro.  The are some rumors floating around that Apple would adopt the new AMD CPU Ryzon, replacing Intel. This is not very likely, but possible as Apple uses AMD GPUs in the iMac. Intel started to ship the new 7th Generation (Kaby Lake) Intel Core i7 (i7-7700) Processors. The new iMac could adopt the new top of the line Intel Desktop CPUs. A new rumor says that the iMac will adopt Intel Xeon CPUs. 3D is exploding in a big way on Windows 10 this spring. Virtual Reality is driving 3D creation, but Apple has so far no solution for this new big trend. The next iMac is according to a rumor featuring powerful AMD graphics to drive a virtual reality headset. Right now creative companies have to get a Windows Gaming PC to use an Oculus Rift or HTC Vive. Apple is rumored to work on an augmented reality solution. That is though likely only for the iPhone. 2017 iMac Release Date At this point it is just guessing. April is a possibility for Apple's first event in 2017. Another option is the WWDC 2017, kicking off on June 5. The WWDC kicks off with a keynote that usually brings new Apple hardware. The new iMac requires a media event. WWDC 2017 is the perfect stage for a new iMac reveal. Another rumor puts the iMac 2017 release into October. Apple just unveiled a bunch of new products including a new iPad and iPhone SE on March 21. The iPhone Plus Red went on sale on March 24. 2017 iMac Price The Microsoft Surface Studio is $800 more expensive in the top configuration than any iMac currently available. The new iMac prices could match Microsoft's prices for the top configuration. The lower end iMac models will likely be priced the same or drop slightly. The 2015 iMac starts at $1,099. The most expensive iMac configurable on apple.com has a price of $3,999. iMac deals are available on amazon.com. Should I Wait to Buy a new iMac? We recommend to hold off with the purchase of a new iMac until at least WWDC 2017. If Apple is not releasing the 2017 iMac in June, the release will be in fall. Apple will not launch the new iMac during the summer. Registration for the WWDC 2017 tickets opens Monday, March 27 at 10:00 a.m. PDT. The opportunity to buy tickets to WWDC17 will be offered by random selection. To register, you must be a member of the Apple Developer Program or Apple Developer Enterprise Program. What is the iMac? In Apple's words: "The idea behind iMac has never wavered: to craft the ultimate desktop experience. The best display, paired with high-performance processors, graphics, and storage — all within an incredibly thin, seamless enclosure. And that commitment continues with the all-new 21.5‑inch iMac with Retina 4K display. Like the revolutionary 27‑inch 5K model, it delivers such spectacular image quality that everything else around you seems to disappear. Adding up to the most immersive iMac experience yet — and another big, beautiful step forward." The iMac is the perfect desktop machine, but it is time for new power, new design, and bigger and better screen. Read the latest Apple News. This story may contain affiliate links.

Tech Apple Science Cars Samsung Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES     2017 IMac Confirmed: Features, Release, Price And Everything You Need To Know Posted: Apr 10 2017, 2:32am CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, in News | Apple     Apple confirms to release a new iMac in 2017. The last time Apple updated the iMac was in 2015. Apple executives have confirmed that a new iMac will be released later this year. The 2017 iMac could to unveiled early as the WWDC 2017 in June. On April 4, Apple's Phil Schiller told a small group of journalists that a new iMac is coming and will also appeal to professional users. Don't Miss: Today's Best Deals on Amazon.com Apple has been under fire for neglecting the desktop for a while now. The official confirmation that a 2017 iMac helps to give iMac users confidence again that new hardware is coming. Microsoft used Apple's moment of weakness in a perfect way. The Surface Studio makes the iMac look like ancient technology. Microsoft in a way is helping Apple iMac fans to get a new iMac sooner than later. The new 2017 iMac needs to be innovative in design and functionality to match Microsoft's stunning device. 2017 iMac Features We can take some pointers from the new MacBook Pro that Apple release end of 2016. Apple might introduce the Touch Bar in the 2017 iMac. Apple has patented the integration of the OLED touch screen on standalone keyboards. LG already said in 2015 that Apple is coming out with an iMac featuring an Retina 8K display. This of course did not happen. One thing that Apple is fond of is though resolution. An iMac Retina 8K is technically possible. The 8K resolution would also allow Apple to give the iMac a bigger screen option. How does a 34" iMac with 8K Display, Core i7 sound? The new iMac will adopt USB-C like the MacBook Pro. This change requires to get new adapters for your peripherals and has already caused a ruckus at the launch of the 2016 MacBook Pro.  The are some rumors floating around that Apple would adopt the new AMD CPU Ryzon, replacing Intel. This is not very likely, but possible as Apple uses AMD GPUs in the iMac. Intel started to ship the new 7th Generation (Kaby Lake) Intel Core i7 (i7-7700) Processors. The new iMac could adopt the new top of the line Intel Desktop CPUs. A new rumor says that the iMac will adopt Intel Xeon CPUs. 3D is exploding in a big way on Windows 10 this spring. Virtual Reality is driving 3D creation, but Apple has so far no solution for this new big trend. The next iMac is according to a rumor featuring powerful AMD graphics to drive a virtual reality headset. Right now creative companies have to get a Windows Gaming PC to use an Oculus Rift or HTC Vive. Apple is rumored to work on an augmented reality solution. That is though likely only for the iPhone. 2017 iMac Release Date At this point it is just guessing. April is a possibility for Apple's first event in 2017. Another option is the WWDC 2017, kicking off on June 5. The WWDC kicks off with a keynote that usually brings new Apple hardware. The new iMac requires a media event. WWDC 2017 is the perfect stage for a new iMac reveal. Another rumor puts the iMac 2017 release into October. Apple just unveiled a bunch of new products including a new iPad and iPhone SE on March 21. The iPhone Plus Red went on sale on March 24. 2017 iMac Price The Microsoft Surface Studio is $800 more expensive in the top configuration than any iMac currently available. The new iMac prices could match Microsoft's prices for the top configuration. The lower end iMac models will likely be priced the same or drop slightly. The 2015 iMac starts at $1,099. The most expensive iMac configurable on apple.com has a price of $3,999. iMac deals are available on amazon.com. Should I Wait to Buy a new iMac? We recommend to hold off with the purchase of a new iMac until at least WWDC 2017. If Apple is not releasing the 2017 iMac in June, the release will be in fall. Apple will not launch the new iMac during the summer. Registration for the WWDC 2017 tickets opens Monday, March 27 at 10:00 a.m. PDT. The opportunity to buy tickets to WWDC17 will be offered by random selection. To register, you must be a member of the Apple Developer Program or Apple Developer Enterprise Program. What is the iMac? In Apple's words: "The idea behind iMac has never wavered: to craft the ultimate desktop experience. The best display, paired with high-performance processors, graphics, and storage — all within an incredibly thin, seamless enclosure. And that commitment continues with the all-new 21.5‑inch iMac with Retina 4K display. Like the revolutionary 27‑inch 5K model, it delivers such spectacular image quality that everything else around you seems to disappear. Adding up to the most immersive iMac experience yet — and another big, beautiful step forward." The iMac is the perfect desktop machine, but it is time for new power, new design, and bigger and better screen. Read the latest Apple News. This story may contain affiliate links.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Samsung Reinvents the Phablet with a Retractable Display, 3D Touch, Dual Projectors to Deliver Content and more | Main | While Apple is set to hit the Restart Button for the Mac Pro, it's the Smartphone Revolution Part 2 that's far more important » April 10, 2017 Google in Negotiations with LG on new OLED Plant and Joint R&D Project Regarding Foldable Smartphones   In December Patently Apple posted two rumor reports (one and two) stating that LG Display was working with Apple, Google & Microsoft regarding next-gen foldable smartphones. Today that news in-part is taking shape. A new Korean report this morning claims that their sources confirm that Google is in negotiations to invest US$876 million in LG Display's new manufacturing facilities for flexible organic light-emitting diode displays (FOLED).   The report further noted that "The move is aimed at securing a stable supply of flexible OLED panels for the next version of Google's modular smartphone Pixel and the development of foldable smartphones amid a global supply shortage of flexible OLED panels, according to the sources.   The sources further noted that the "talks are also reportedly ongoing between Google and LG Display on joint research and development on foldable smartphones."   Samsung Display is currently the sole supplier of the flexible OLED panels. Most of the panels will be supplied to Apple and Samsung Electronics this year for both Apple's new iPhone 8 and the Samsung Galaxy S8. This is expected to cause a global strain on panel supplies.   Google's investment is large enough to build a new production line for flexible OLED panels. LG Display is currently working to establish sixth-generation flexible OLED production facilities in its plants at Gumi, North Gyeongsang Province, and Paju, Gyeonggi Province. The facility at the Gumi plant is expected to start operating in the third quarter of this year, while the one in Paju is likely to begin operations next year.   A second report on the matter added that "The investment could be a big boon for LG Display. The company needs money to diversify from LCD and large-sized OLED panels. The possible deal with Google will help LG Display not only reduce the burden to expand production capability but also secure a major client over the long term."   The Pixel smartphones, which have OLED displays, drew favorable market responses, especially in the absence of Samsung Electronics' Galaxy Note 7 over the holiday season. But Google didn't produce the Pixel smartphones on a massive scale due to an insufficient supply of small-sized OLED panels, according to observers.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Crafty Fokker: Norfolk surgeon builds Red Baron triplane replica Personal Tech Apple’s premium TV plans – the hobby doomed to stay that way How premium, you ask? 10 Apr 2017 at 09:35, Thomas Flanagan, Faultline Analysis When YouTube announced its standalone TV subscription service last month, Faultline called for Apple to return fire, and last week there were rumours doing the rounds that Apple is preparing to rope in premium content providers to offer a bundled subscription package of its own. To show you how fast this is moving, last week YouTube debuted in New York, LA, the Bay Area, Chicago and Philadelphia. In 2007, Steve Jobs described Apple TV as a “hobby” when the company first unveiled the fledgling product, but ten years on, little seems to have changed in his absence. To this end, Faultine thinks Apple's proposed premium bundle is doomed to fail unless it follows through with its explorations into original content, as noted by CEO Tim Cook at Apple's earnings conference back in February, when he suggested that the company is “learning a lot about the original content business". A report from Recode claims to have inside information that Apple is at the negotiating table with HBO, Starz and Showtime, but these suggestions seem flimsy at best, and we see this as Apple taking the easiest possible route to market in a desperate and unimaginative attempt to enter an already crowded market. The financial rewards from this type of bundled service will be nowhere near as rich as if Apple took the plunge by building its own streaming service from scratch, with both original and contracted content – something it should have done a long time ago. Although, it could indeed act as a stepping stone towards one day achieving a genuinely disruptive service in the OTT video market and joining in the bombardment of pay TV providers. It may not be set for big things, but even a relatively low uptake of any Apple TV content package will lead to a spate of cord-cutting – nudging another nail gently into the coffin of traditional pay TV. The report did not reveal at what price much Apple is planning to retail the bundled service, but, considering that it currently sells HBO at $15 a month, Showtime at $11 a month and Starz for $9 a month, a bundle for the trio could perhaps be priced at between $25 to $35 a month – not high enough to make huge profits given the hefty carriage costs, and not low enough to convert hordes of consumers. This would put Apple's premium TV offering at around the same price point as DirecTV Now and YouTube TV, both costing $35 a month, but both boasting much broader content catalogues than Apple will throw up with HBO, Showtime and Starz. Plus, both AT&T and YouTube have larger bases of existing video customers compared to Apple TV. Another unconfirmed detail is if the service will only be accessible on Apple TV devices, in which case it would set consumers back an additional $69 for the latest appropriate hardware. It is unlikely that Apple would exclude its iOS user base from getting the service, but a more appealing offering could drive purchases of Apple TV, while DirecTV is giving shipments a helping hand by offering a free Apple TV for consumers who prepay for three months of DirecTV Now upfront. A shortcut on the path to original content has long been thought of as a likely strategy for Apple, but it has continuously failed to pull out its check book to make a major content acquisition, despite rumours with more backbone than those in this week's report. YouTube TV meanwhile, is set to launch in the US later this spring with a skinny bundle of 40 channels - combining networks from broadcast and cable, including ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC, ESPN, Bravo, Disney Channel, Fox News, FX, MSNBC, Sprout and USA Network. It will roll out as a standalone app with six accounts available per subscription, and includes unlimited cloud DVR storage with no fixed term contract, allowing subscribers to cancel at any time. The Apple rumours come less than a week after Verizon also revealed plans to launch an OTT offering this summer, separate to its Go90 mobile streaming service, amid a restructuring within the company which saw ex-Ericsson CEO Hans Vestberg take the helm of the newly formed Network and Technology division. Verizon chairman and CEO Lowell McAdam commented that the launch would give the company "greater organizational agility to continue to lead the market with our wireless and fiber services, scale and expand our media and telematics businesses, and maintain the leadership in network reliability and new technology that is a Verizon trademark."

But fast-forward to 2017, and it appears that a lot of innovation is coming from other companies. Amazon has a hit with its Echo, a speaker device that responds to voice commands. Reviewers say Microsoft's Surface competes with the Mac. And now, Samsung's Galaxy S8 smartphone is getting raves because of its battery life and high-end screen. Business Even Without A Headphone Jack, iPhone 7 Boosts Apple's Sales Both Apple fans and analysts who follow the company are beginning to wonder whether Apple has lost its mojo. All those innovations happened when Steve Jobs, Apple's co-founder, was running the company. And some former employees say a cultural shift occurred at Apple after Jobs died in 2011. One of those former employees is Bob Burrough, a software engineer and a manager who worked on the team that helped create the iPhone. He says under Jobs, every employee was encouraged to take personal responsibility for improving the products. "It was all about we're all working towards the same goal," Burrough says. "We're all working on the same product and if there's something that you see that needs to get done you basically just stepped in and took care of it." Burrough shares an example. He worked on the iPod nano. Just as they were about to ship the first units, Burrough realized that 2,000 of them had been left running, draining the batteries. "I told the distribution center, 'Look, you need to go pull them back out of the box, shut them down and make sure that the batteries are fully charged when they come out of the box to go into the customer's hand for the very first time,' " Burrough says. But he argues the culture at Apple changed when Tim Cook took over as CEO. Burrough says employees were getting the message to look down and do their jobs. Burrough says that when he saw something wrong, "the way that I was expected to deal with it was shut my mouth and do my job, and take care of whatever my assigned responsibility was and (not) worry about what anybody else is doing." Burrough, who left Apple in 2014, thinks the culture shift has affected the products because employees feel less invested. Bryson Gardner has similar memories. He worked at Apple for nearly a decade and was one of the team leaders for iPod and iPhone development. Gardner says Jobs liked debate about how to make products better — and his style was to listen and then make a decision. All Tech Considered 'Irresistible' By Design: It's No Accident You Can't Stop Looking At The Screen "His clarity of vision was very effective," Gardner says. "It actually made my job very easy in retrospect." Cook is a more traditional CEO, Gardner says, and doesn't like people arguing — instead, typically bringing together top managers and building consensus rather than letting them debate it out until he makes a decision. Apple has entered one new product category under Cook. It released the Apple Watch. But it was late to the wearables game and Apple has yet to release figures on sales of the Watch. It has also introduced Apple Pay and thumbprint security. But many analysts don't think these compare to previous innovations. Gardner thinks, in some ways, Apple is a victim of its own success. And he thinks even Jobs may have had a harder time being innovative under the weight of the iPhone, which now brings in 70 percent of Apple's revenue. "Looking historically at Apple, there was more equal importance across a lot of the product lines and more opportunity to push into new spaces," Gardner says. But now, "one of the challenges is how do you manage the iPhone in relation to all the other technologies that you could be doing?" Planet Money Episode 596: Hacking The iPhone For Fun, Profit, And Maybe Espionage To Forrester Research analyst James McQuivey, Apple risks going down the same path as Sony, which used to be seen as the high-end and most innovative tech company. It once dominated the market for portable music players. "As recently as 2000 people were still talking about the Walkman and what a big innovation that was," McQuivey says. "Well, you don't hear people talk about Sony like that anymore." Of course, it took a long time for Sony to lose its reputation for innovation, McQuivey says, and Apple's place as an innovator isn't likely to go away tomorrow. In fact, a lot of people are rooting for the company, including former employees Burrough and Gardner. "Like many other customers, I would like them to make more things," Gardner says. "It would be great to have something else people lined up around the block for" besides the iPhone. But, for now, the iPhone is still a product that a lot of people love. Enough for Apple to still be the most valuable company in the world. All Tech Considered At 30, The Original Mac Is Still An Archetype Of Innovation Business Can Apple Fly As High Without Steve Jobs?

Steven Troughton-Smith, a well-known developer claims that Apple plans to pull out support for 32-bit apps altogether with iOS 11. This means that several legacy apps will stop functioning post-September. Although the source of this information is not revealed, Smith tweeted that he's hearing "very clearly iOS 11 won't have 32bit app support at all." However, the news should not come as much of a surprise to the developers or the users. Apple has been sending alerts to its users for a long time that pops up whenever they open a 32-bit app on iOS. Also Read: Android and iOS devices can be easily hacked by malicious Wi-Fi networks The pop-up notification tells the users to update the app or else it wouldn't function with future versions of iOS. iPhone 5s was the first iPhone to support 64-bit applications and since February 2015, Apple needed developers to come up with new apps that have 64-bit support. The iPhone maker's conquest against 32-bit apps started with iOS 9. Apple then started alerting users saying that since the app was 32-bit, it may slow down the device performance. And with the arrival of iOS 10.3, it increased the severity of the warning. Moreover, Smith says in a tweet that it "sounds like future A-series chips won't even include 32-bit support", a move which could clean up performance/die space. Apple is likely to take this step in order to "remove problematic and abandoned apps" from the App Store.

But Buffett is a superior model for investors to follow because of his patient style and focus on finding great businesses. Adam Levine-Weinberg (TMFGemHunter) Apr 9, 2017 at 8:24PM Warren Buffett and Carl Icahn are arguably the two most successful investors of their generation. Both have compiled enviable performance records for more than half a century. Since 2000, shares of their publicly traded investment vehicles -- Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) and Icahn Enterprises (NASDAQ:IEP) -- have crushed the S&P 500's return. Any sane investor would be happy with either track record. Berkshire Hathaway and Icahn Enterprises vs. the S&P 500, 2000 - present. Data by YCharts. Nevertheless, Buffett's straightforward, patient investment philosophy represents a much better model for investors to try to mimic, rather than Icahn's fast-paced, high-stakes investing style. In particular, Warren Buffett differs from Carl Icahn in having a long-term mindset and a fundamentally optimistic outlook. These are two key traits that individual investors can, and should, try to internalize. Image source: The Motley Fool. Examining the performance records To begin to understand why investors should emulate Warren Buffett rather than Carl Icahn, let's compare their investment records. At first, Icahn might seem to have the superior track record. After all, Icahn Enterprises stock has outperformed Berkshire Hathaway stock by nearly 200 percentage points since 2000. However, Icahn Enterprises is structured as a partnership. This means it doesn't have to pay corporate taxes -- instead, shareholders must pay income tax on their share of the company's earnings. That can lead to hefty tax bills whenever Icahn Enterprises sells an asset for a big gain. Moreover, it's not clear that Icahn's strategy has stood the test of time. Over the past decade, Icahn Enterprises shares have lost more than half of their value. During that same time, the S&P 500 has risen 64%, and Berkshire Hathaway's stock price has more than doubled. (More recently, Icahn's hedge fund has lost money for three years running, including declines of about 18% and 20% in 2015 and 2016, respectively.) Berkshire Hathaway and Icahn Enterprises vs. the S&P 500, 2007 - present. Data by YCharts. Furthermore, even if Icahn is just in a temporary slump, most investors can't afford the extreme volatility of his investment returns. Having less than half of your initial investment after a decade is not an acceptable outcome. Berkshire Hathaway stock has delivered much more consistent growth over time. Lastly, Warren Buffett demolishes Icahn in terms of total wealth-creation. Berkshire Hathaway's market cap has expanded by roughly $340 billion since the beginning of 2000. That's about 50 times greater than the increase in Icahn Enterprises' market cap over that period. Simply put, Carl Icahn has been managing far less money than Buffett, which is a huge advantage in terms of posting big gains in percentage terms. All in all, while Buffett and Icahn both have incredible investing track records when you consider the entirety of their careers, Buffett's performance is more impressive than Icahn's. Slow and steady wins the race From a high-level perspective, Buffett's strategy can be described as buying and holding great businesses with durable competitive advantages. By contrast, Icahn tries to make timely bets on out-of-favor companies that are ripe for a rebound. Let's take a look at two reasons why investors can expect better results from following a Buffett-like approach. Icahn's investments in Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) highlight one flaw in his investment process: short-term thinking. Carl Icahn isn't a day-trader, but he routinely dumps stocks within two or three years of buying them. Thus, even when he finds undervalued gems, he doesn't always fully capitalize on those opportunities. For example, Icahn scooped up about 5.5 million shares of Netflix in 2012 at an average price of $58, just as the stock was bottoming out after falling from a high above $300 the year before. At the time, he thought the company was likely to be acquired soon. No buyout offer materialized. Yet Netflix stock soared anyway as its move into original content began to drive strong growth for its streaming service. Icahn began selling his Netflix shares a little over a year later, by which point they had already more than quintupled in value. By mid-2015, he had closed the position entirely, booking a profit of roughly $2 billion on an initial investment of a little more than $300 million. Icahn's investment in Netflix was clearly a success. Yet Netflix stock has continued to soar in recent years, and it recently surpassed $143 per share (approximately $1,000 per share on a pre-split basis). If Icahn had held on to his original position, he would be sitting on a gain of more than $5 billion by now. Data by YCharts. Around the same time Icahn was selling the last of his Netflix shares, he was talking up Apple stock in a big way. He initially invested in Apple in mid-2013, after the stock price plummeted from a peak of $700 to around $400. Icahn eventually accumulated nearly 53 million shares (accounting for a later 7-for-1 split) at an average price of about $70 per share (or $420 per share in pre-split terms). Icahn then wrote a series of letters urging Apple to buy back stock. These letters pegged the company's intrinsic value at ever more lofty heights, topping out at $240 per share in May 2015. Less than a year later, Icahn had liquidated all of his Apple holdings, winding up with another $2 billion profit (albeit on a larger initial investment this time). He attributed his abrupt change of heart to concerns that Chinese government policies would undermine Apple's growth. And once again, Carl Icahn left a lot of money on the table, as Apple recently returned to EPS growth. If he had held on to the stock, his gains would have reached $3.7 billion by now. Just as Icahn was dumping Apple stock, Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway began accumulating shares. By the end of 2016, Berkshire had acquired more than 61 million shares at an average price of around $110. Buffett more than doubled that Apple investment in January 2017 to about 133 million shares. Berkshire Hathaway has thus profited from Apple stock's recent run, which has left it trading near $140. Apple Stock Performance, data by YCharts. Buffett's Apple stake is now worth more than $18 billion and is already showing a paper gain of more than $3 billion. Unlike Icahn, Buffett is likely to ride out Apple's ups and downs going forward, recognizing that the company is a great business with a bright future. Pessimism doesn't pay (in the long run) A second problem that has dragged Icahn down in recent years is his pessimism. For the past year in particular, Icahn's hedge fund has had a massive net short position -- i.e., a big bet that the market would plunge. During 2016, the losses on these short positions overwhelmed the gains on the few stocks that Icahn's fund owns. By contrast, Warren Buffett is an eternal optimist. In his recent 2016 Berkshire Hathaway shareholder letter, Buffett wrote: "One word sums up our country's achievements: miraculous. ... Starting from scratch, America has amassed wealth totaling $90 trillion." Indeed, the evidence clearly shows that long-term investors should be optimists. A single dollar invested in the market at the beginning of 1871 would be worth about $300,000 today (assuming you reinvested your dividends). Even after adjusting for a century and a half of inflation, the dollar would be worth more than $15,000. Just looking over the past decade, index funds tracking the S&P 500 have generated a total return of more than 100%, despite sustaining a 50% drop during the Great Recession. Data by YCharts. Obviously, bear markets happen, and they can be very painful for investors. A pessimistic investor is bound to be right some of the time. But given that the stock market's long-term trajectory is strongly positive, it's far better to err on the side of optimism and be patient during market downturns than to bet against the market. Great companies are the greatest investments During the course of his long career, Carl Icahn has shown that a savvy investor with plenty of capital can make a boatload of money by shaking up companies that aren't living up to their full potential. His success has paved the way for today's crop of activist investors. Nevertheless, Warren Buffett has demonstrated that it's possible to generate more consistent outperformance by finding great companies and investing in them for the long term. This allows the magic of compounding to go to work, turning years of profit growth into huge gains for investors. That's why investors should aim to invest like Warren Buffett -- not like Carl Icahn.

But fast-forward to 2017, and it appears that a lot of innovation is coming from other companies. Amazon has a hit with its Echo, a speaker device that responds to voice commands. Reviewers say Microsoft's Surface competes with the Mac. And now, Samsung's Galaxy S8 smartphone is getting raves because of its battery life and high-end screen. Business Even Without A Headphone Jack, iPhone 7 Boosts Apple's Sales Both Apple fans and analysts who follow the company are beginning to wonder whether Apple has lost its mojo. All those innovations happened when Steve Jobs, Apple's co-founder, was running the company. And some former employees say a cultural shift occurred at Apple after Jobs died in 2011. One of those former employees is Bob Burrough, a software engineer and a manager who worked on the team that helped create the iPhone. He says under Jobs, every employee was encouraged to take personal responsibility for improving the products. "It was all about we're all working towards the same goal," Burrough says. "We're all working on the same product and if there's something that you see that needs to get done you basically just stepped in and took care of it." Burrough shares an example. He worked on the iPod nano. Just as they were about to ship the first units, Burrough realized that 2,000 of them had been left running, draining the batteries. "I told the distribution center, 'Look, you need to go pull them back out of the box, shut them down and make sure that the batteries are fully charged when they come out of the box to go into the customer's hand for the very first time,' " Burrough says. But he argues the culture at Apple changed when Tim Cook took over as CEO. Burrough says employees were getting the message to look down and do their jobs. Burrough says that when he saw something wrong, "the way that I was expected to deal with it was shut my mouth and do my job, and take care of whatever my assigned responsibility was and (not) worry about what anybody else is doing." Burrough, who left Apple in 2014, thinks the culture shift has affected the products because employees feel less invested. Bryson Gardner has similar memories. He worked at Apple for nearly a decade and was one of the team leaders for iPod and iPhone development. Gardner says Jobs liked debate about how to make products better — and his style was to listen and then make a decision.

Apple has entered one new product category under Cook. It released the Apple Watch. But it was late to the wearables game and Apple has yet to release figures on sales of the Watch. It has also introduced Apple Pay and thumbprint security. But many analysts don't think these compare to previous innovations. Gardner thinks, in some ways, Apple is a victim of its own success. And he thinks even Jobs may have had a harder time being innovative under the weight of the iPhone, which now brings in 70 percent of Apple's revenue. "Looking historically at Apple, there was more equal importance across a lot of the product lines and more opportunity to push into new spaces," Gardner says. But now, "one of the challenges is how do you manage the iPhone in relation to all the other technologies that you could be doing?" Planet Money Episode 596: Hacking The iPhone For Fun, Profit, And Maybe Espionage To Forrester Research analyst James McQuivey, Apple risks going down the same path as Sony, which used to be seen as the high-end and most innovative tech company. It once dominated the market for portable music players. "As recently as 2000 people were still talking about the Walkman and what a big innovation that was," McQuivey says. "Well, you don't hear people talk about Sony like that anymore." Of course, it took a long time for Sony to lose its reputation for innovation, McQuivey says, and Apple's place as an innovator isn't likely to go away tomorrow. In fact, a lot of people are rooting for the company, including former employees Burrough and Gardner. "Like many other customers, I would like them to make more things," Gardner says. "It would be great to have something else people lined up around the block for" besides the iPhone. But, for now, the iPhone is still a product that a lot of people love. Enough for Apple to still be the most valuable company in the world. All Tech Considered At 30, The Original Mac Is Still An Archetype Of Innovation Business Can Apple Fly As High Without Steve Jobs?

This became clearer after the launch of iOS 10.3 where Apple put out clear warnings through pop-up messages hinting that older apps will not work with future versions of iOS. Now there’s more news on this front and it even includes speculation about future Apple processors not including 32-bit support altogether. 9to5mac reports that Apple will be making a drastic change this fall. A prominent developer Steven Troughton-Smith put out tweets explaining that this Apple will cease to support these older apps. While hundreds of 32-bit apps continue to work right now (with the warning pop-up) these may no longer work or show up on the App Store after iOS 11 come out in September this year. (…and it sounds like future A-series chips won’t even include 32-bit support. Wonder if that’ll free up any performance/die space?) — Steve T-S (@stroughtonsmith) April 8, 2017 Smith puts it out clearly that developers either need to upgrade of they will be chucked out of the iOS ecosystem once users upgrade to iOS 11. Additionally, Smith also speculated that A-Series chips from Apple in the future may not even include support for 32-bit instructions. With these missing at the hardware level in upcoming iPhones, there is literally no future for these 32-bit apps. Indeed, the move comes as no surprise as Apple has been warning users about coaxing their app developers to upgrade their apps. The move comes as Apple seems on a warpath to remove older, problematic and abandoned apps (ones that haven’t been updated for years) from its App Store in a bid to maintain higher app quality standards over quantity. Since the announcement in September, Apple has managed to purge about 50,000 such apps from the App Store. iOS 11,l with its new standards, is expected to reveal a better kill rate for abandoned apps. If you are unsure about which apps on your iOS device are 32-bit, you can simply head to Settings> General> About> Applications. If you are able to open the ‘applications’ page, then you do have one or more 32-bit apps running on your device and they’ll be listed there. If not, you will simply not be able to open the Applications section, which means that you have nothing to worry about. If you do find some 32-bit apps that you can’t live without, you’d better hope that the app’s developer will listen to your piteous pleas for an update. If not, tough luck.

But it seems Apple has big plans for their awkward wireless earphones. The company has filed for a patent around the AirPods and its something quite out of the ordinary. According to the patent documents, a special case for the Airpods will offer provision for inductive charging. This means it could provide power to devices such as Apple Watch, iPods, iPhones, iPads and even MacBooks in the future. The schematics of the case show a watch on top of the case, which is probably the most suitable device. The current Apple Watch Series 2 comes with a 273 mAh battery while the current AirPods case has a 398 mAh battery. If Apple were to make a slightly bigger case, it could very well charge the AirPods and the watch. The patent goes on to say, “Such devices can include, for example, portable music players (e.g., MP3 devices and Apple’s iPod devices), portable video players (e.g., portable DVD players), cellular telephones (e.g., smart telephones such as Apple’s iPhone devices), video cameras, digital still cameras, projection systems (e.g., holographic projection systems), gaming systems, PDAs, as well as tablet (e.g., Apple’s iPad devices), laptop (e.g. MacBooks) or other mobile computers. Some of these devices can be configured to provide audio, video or other data or sensory output.” But in making a bigger case, Apple could risk the factor of portability. Of course, this is just a patent filing and it doesn’t mean that we are going to see an AirPods case with inductive charging anytime soon.

Donklephant Primary Navigation Please select a menu in this location Home Software Emergency Patch for Broadcom Drive-By Wi-Fi Security Hole By Costea Lestoc. Published on April 10, 2017. 0 Yesterday we received an emergency patch released by Apple with the purpose of plugging a security hole. This was a really serious issue, since it could be used in order to take control over iPhones, iPads and iPods in a silent and wireless manner. What is the cause? This happened because the remote-code execution issue appeared in the Wi-Fi stak from Broadcom, which is used for Apple products. Lots of other Wi-Fi routers and handsets rely on the HardMAC chipset made by Broadcom, and as a consequence we should expect soon other tablet and phone producers to release patches. At the moment, any gadget that is using the vulnerable technology provided by Broadcom is risking an OTA (over-the-air) hijacking, not just the Apple products. Gal Beniamini, who works at the Google Project Zero, summarized the issue quite well. The firmware that is used by the Broadcom wireless SoC (system on chip) can be forced to overrun its own stack buffers. He could actually send wireless frames to the Wi-Fi controller in order to overflow the initial stack, and then combined this action with firings for the CPU frequent timer, and so he could overwrite specific parts of the RAM until he executed arbitrary code. In basic English, someone who wants to attack your device only needs to be in the Wi-Fi range so that they can gain control over an Apple or Android device. The hacker needs to connect to the same wireless network or they have to set up an open access point and the victim connects to it. The Android devices that use this technology are the Nexus 5, 6 and 6P, together with most Samsung flagship devices. When it comes to iPhones, all the iPhone since the iPhone 4 and newer models of iPod and iPads are at risk.

Marketsizeforecasters.com adds new global OLED Display market: report that lists top active companies as LG Display and Samsung Display. Other Prominent Vendors in the market are: AU Optronics, BOE Technology, CSOT, EverDisplay Optronics (EDO), Japan Display, RiTdisplay, Universal Display, and Visionox. Research Analysts forecast the global OLED Display market to grow at a CAGR of 21.86% during the period 2017-2021.   Request a sample copy of OLED Display Market Research Report @ https://marketsizeforecasters.com/get-sample/18249 Commenting on the report, an analyst team said: The latest trend gaining momentum in the market is technological advances in augmented reality. Apple partnered with Carl Zeiss, a German optics manufacturer, for the development of smart glasses set to be launched in the 2018. Based on patents released by Apple in June 2016, it used foldable TAMOLED display that can be wrapped around on the user’s head. Apple’s US patent No. 9,367,093 titled Transparent Electronic Device and patent No. 9,367,095 titled Electronic Device with Wrap Around Display would also have AR by incorporating TOLED. The listed pricing for this OLED Display Market report starts at $ 3500. Request Discount for OLED Display Market Research Report @ https://marketsizeforecasters.com/enquire-for-discount/18249 According to the report, one of the major drivers for this market is reducing profitability of LCD displays. Samsung Display had shut down Gen-5 LCD line in Cheonan and L 7 production line in South Chungcheong Province that makes Gen-7 LCD displays in 2016. It is rumored that Samsung Display would shift focus on OLED displays due to the growing demand from end-users, especially from Apple. Further, the report states that one of the major factors hindering the growth of this market is high cost of production and ASP. The raw materials and encapsulation equipment needed for manufacturing OLED screens are highly expensive. Since the market does not have sufficient sales in the initial years of the forecast period, the fall of ASP would be slow. Vendors in the market are expected to realize economies of scale only by the end of the forecast period. The study was conducted using an objective combination of primary and secondary information including inputs from key participants in the industry. The report contains a comprehensive market and vendor landscape in addition to a SWOT analysis of the key vendors.

But fast-forward to 2017, and it appears that a lot of innovation is coming from other companies. Amazon has a hit with its Echo, a speaker device that responds to voice commands. Reviewers say Microsoft's Surface competes with the Mac. And now, Samsung's Galaxy S8 smartphone is getting raves because of its battery life and high-end screen. Business Even Without A Headphone Jack, iPhone 7 Boosts Apple's Sales Both Apple fans and analysts who follow the company are beginning to wonder whether Apple has lost its mojo. All those innovations happened when Steve Jobs, Apple's co-founder, was running the company. And some former employees say a cultural shift occurred at Apple after Jobs died in 2011. One of those former employees is Bob Burrough, a software engineer and a manager who worked on the team that helped create the iPhone. He says under Jobs, every employee was encouraged to take personal responsibility for improving the products. "It was all about we're all working towards the same goal," Burrough says. "We're all working on the same product and if there's something that you see that needs to get done you basically just stepped in and took care of it." Burrough shares an example. He worked on the iPod nano. Just as they were about to ship the first units, Burrough realized that 2,000 of them had been left running, draining the batteries. "I told the distribution center, 'Look, you need to go pull them back out of the box, shut them down and make sure that the batteries are fully charged when they come out of the box to go into the customer's hand for the very first time,' " Burrough says. But he argues the culture at Apple changed when Tim Cook took over as CEO. Burrough says employees were getting the message to look down and do their jobs. Burrough says that when he saw something wrong, "the way that I was expected to deal with it was shut my mouth and do my job, and take care of whatever my assigned responsibility was and (not) worry about what anybody else is doing." Burrough, who left Apple in 2014, thinks the culture shift has affected the products because employees feel less invested. Bryson Gardner has similar memories. He worked at Apple for nearly a decade and was one of the team leaders for iPod and iPhone development. Gardner says Jobs liked debate about how to make products better — and his style was to listen and then make a decision. All Tech Considered 'Irresistible' By Design: It's No Accident You Can't Stop Looking At The Screen "His clarity of vision was very effective," Gardner says. "It actually made my job very easy in retrospect." Cook is a more traditional CEO, Gardner says, and doesn't like people arguing — instead, typically bringing together top managers and building consensus rather than letting them debate it out until he makes a decision. Apple has entered one new product category under Cook. It released the Apple Watch. But it was late to the wearables game and Apple has yet to release figures on sales of the Watch. It has also introduced Apple Pay and thumbprint security. But many analysts don't think these compare to previous innovations. Gardner thinks, in some ways, Apple is a victim of its own success. And he thinks even Jobs may have had a harder time being innovative under the weight of the iPhone, which now brings in 70 percent of Apple's revenue. "Looking historically at Apple, there was more equal importance across a lot of the product lines and more opportunity to push into new spaces," Gardner says. But now, "one of the challenges is how do you manage the iPhone in relation to all the other technologies that you could be doing?"

In fact, a lot of people are rooting for the company, including former employees Burrough and Gardner. "Like many other customers, I would like them to make more things," Gardner says. "It would be great to have something else people lined up around the block for" besides the iPhone. But, for now, the iPhone is still a product that a lot of people love.

Search Listen Live Wyoming Public Radio Classical Wyoming Wyoming Sounds Jazz Wyoming Has Apple Lost Its Innovation Mojo? By Laura Sydell • 22 hours ago TweetShareGoogle+Email Mark Lennihan / AP Listen Listening... / Originally published on April 10, 2017 8:58 am It's daunting to think about the number of products Apple has created that have transformed how most people use technology: the original Mac with the first mass-produced mouse, the iMac, the iPod, the iPhone, the iPad. But fast-forward to 2017, and it appears that a lot of innovation is coming from other companies. Amazon has a hit with its Echo, a speaker device that responds to voice commands. Reviewers say Microsoft's Surface competes with the Mac. And now, Samsung's Galaxy S8 smartphone is getting raves because of its battery life and high-end screen. Both Apple fans and analysts who follow the company are beginning to wonder whether Apple has lost its mojo. All those innovations happened when Steve Jobs, Apple's co-founder, was running the company. And some former employees say a cultural shift occurred at Apple after Jobs died in 2011. One of those former employees is Bob Burrough, a software engineer and a manager who worked on the team that helped create the iPhone. He says under Jobs, every employee was encouraged to take personal responsibility for improving the products. "It was all about we're all working towards the same goal," Burrough says. "We're all working on the same product and if there's something that you see that needs to get done you basically just stepped in and took care of it." Burrough shares an example. He worked on the iPod nano. Just as they were about to ship the first units, Burrough realized that 2,000 of them had been left running, draining the batteries. "I told the distribution center, 'Look, you need to go pull them back out of the box, shut them down and make sure that the batteries are fully charged when they come out of the box to go into the customer's hand for the very first time,' " Burrough says. But he argues the culture at Apple changed when Tim Cook took over as CEO. Burrough says employees were getting the message to look down and do their jobs. Burrough says that when he saw something wrong, "the way that I was expected to deal with it was shut my mouth and do my job, and take care of whatever my assigned responsibility was and (not) worry about what anybody else is doing." Burrough, who left Apple in 2014, thinks the culture shift has affected the products because employees feel less invested. Bryson Gardner has similar memories. He worked at Apple for nearly a decade and was one of the team leaders for iPod and iPhone development. Gardner says Jobs liked debate about how to make products better — and his style was to listen and then make a decision. "His clarity of vision was very effective," Gardner says. "It actually made my job very easy in retrospect." Cook is a more traditional CEO, Gardner says, and doesn't like people arguing — instead, typically bringing together top managers and building consensus rather than letting them debate it out until he makes a decision. Apple has entered one new product category under Cook. It released the Apple Watch. But it was late to the wearables game and Apple has yet to release figures on sales of the Watch. It has also introduced Apple Pay and thumbprint security. But many analysts don't think these compare to previous innovations. Gardner thinks, in some ways, Apple is a victim of its own success. And he thinks even Jobs may have had a harder time being innovative under the weight of the iPhone, which now brings in 70 percent of Apple's revenue. "Looking historically at Apple, there was more equal importance across a lot of the product lines and more opportunity to push into new spaces," Gardner says. But now, "one of the challenges is how do you manage the iPhone in relation to all the other technologies that you could be doing?" To Forrester Research analyst James McQuivey, Apple risks going down the same path as Sony, which used to be seen as the high-end and most innovative tech company. It once dominated the market for portable music players. "As recently as 2000 people were still talking about the Walkman and what a big innovation that was," McQuivey says. "Well, you don't hear people talk about Sony like that anymore." Of course, it took a long time for Sony to lose its reputation for innovation, McQuivey says, and Apple's place as an innovator isn't likely to go away tomorrow. In fact, a lot of people are rooting for the company, including former employees Burrough and Gardner. "Like many other customers, I would like them to make more things," Gardner says. "It would be great to have something else people lined up around the block for" besides the iPhone. But, for now, the iPhone is still a product that a lot of people love. Enough for Apple to still be the most valuable company in the world. Copyright 2017 NPR. To see more, visit http://www.npr.org/. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: Privacy groups lost a major battle when Congress and President Trump canceled Internet privacy rules written under the Obama administration. The regulations prevented Internet service providers from selling your web browsing history to third parties, and they were stricter than rules for other kinds of Internet firms. But as NPR's Martin Kaste reports, the fight's not over. It's just moved to the states. MARTIN KASTE, BYLINE: Drew Hansen is a Democrat in the Washington State House, and Internet privacy policy is not something he usually deals with. But that's changing after this action by Congress. DREW HANSEN: One of my constituents emailed me and said, I'm outraged that Congress is going to allow Internet service providers to sell my browsing history; can we do anything about that? And I said, well, I don't know. That's a great question. Let me find out. KASTE: He talked to the lawyers, and they didn't see why he couldn't just introduce legislation for a state version of the privacy rules that Congress had just canceled. HANSEN: Well, there's no conflict here. I mean the federal entities have just chosen not to act. Federal law in this area is a floor rather than a ceiling. There's nothing to protect states from being more protective of privacy than the federal government has chosen to do. KASTE: And he's not alone in thinking this way. Legislators around the country are responding to public anger and introducing ISP privacy bills in Minnesota, Illinois, Maryland. The list keeps growing. But is it really true that there's no conflict here with the feds? Blake Reid is an expert on telecom law at the University of Colorado. BLAKE REID: Anytime states are intruding into an area or - I shouldn't say intruding but treading into an area that the federal government has got a significant role - and telecommunications is one such area - there's always this question of whether Congress has intended to preempt states' role in that. KASTE: The federal agency with authority over ISPs is the FCC, and it's not saying whether it thinks the states are intruding on its turf. Jim Halpert is a lawyer for a coalition of tech companies which includes ISP. He says it may come down to how well the states write their rules. He says some of them have been overreaching. He calls it the meat-axe approach. JIM HALPERT: If you categorically say you cannot collect information or disclose information, that's what the internet does. (Laughter) It - having a barrier to that unless a user consents is likely to result in frustrating consumers, and it's also likely to be unconstitutional. KASTE: Halpert says states can expect to spend some tax dollars defending laws like that in court. Ernesto Falcon is legislative council for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which is one of the groups that fought to keep the stricter federal privacy rules. ERNESTO FALCON: I think in the long term this is something that either the federal judiciary or Congress will have to resolve. In the short term, though, because you really do have a clear gap in privacy protections now, the states are going to have to fill the void. KASTE: But he also agrees that the states that passed their own ISP privacy laws can expect things to get litigious. Martin Kaste, NPR News.

The pop up notification reads that the app must be updated by the developer or else it may not work with future versions of iOS,” tech website 9to5mac.com reported on Monday.

The company also asked developers to submit new apps with 64-bit support since February 2015 and app updates starting June 2015. Last month, Apple has officially released iOS 10.3 update that has major updates regarding its newly launched AirPods, WiFi calling and SiriKit. Other minor updates include new security features and a new iCloud section under the Apple ID Settings menu. The new section shows a breakdown of cloud storage usage. This feature also shows which apps use iCloud.

The new varieties are Honey Apple and Sriracha flavored beef jerky. The Sriracha Beef Jerky is a spicy variety for the consumer group that prefers a more traditional style snack. The heat is subtle and a moderate but it is not overwhelming and delivers a chili pepper taste.

The Honey apple is a new flavor on the market that is unique to BeefJerky.Rocks. After months of perfecting the flavor and texture the company says that it is ready for public consumption. It pairs up the beef flavor with smoke, honey and all natural apple flavoring. The honey apple beef jerky is sweet and tender and delivers no heat at all. “We’re excited about the new flavors that we’ve added to our product list,” say Jim Sokol, CEO and owner of Saginaw Snacks, LLC. “With so much competition in the beef jerky market, we believe that our unique flavor offerings such as Honey Apple and Sriracha set us apart for all the rest.” The new beef jerky products are available on their website BeefJerky.Rocks, and are also available in various stores around New England.

Mercedes-Benz is confident it is “the first truck manufacture to bring the Apple CarPlay infotainment system into its vehicles.” While this might be technically true, Scania is also introducing the technology for its truck, claiming it’s “among the first in the industry” to do it. The German company says the connectivity will be offered for the Actros, Antos, and Arocs models equipped with the Multimedia Radio Touch radio system. Apple CarPlay will allow the driver to “safely and conveniently use his iPhone and a variety of apps while on the move.” Android users will probably be happy to hear the system also works with MirrorLink, the counterpart to Apple CarPlay. Just like in most of the modern cars, the system can be operated through an advanced voice control function, which also can be used to browse and use the different applications, such as telephone, music, maps, news, iTunes, etc. Read also: Scania creates the world's largest clock with trucks Volkswagen resumes their buying spree, moves to takeover the rest of Scania Naturally, Scania’s system will be identical and will be available for customers who have a Scania Infotainment System with a seven-inch touch screen and the Voice Control Option. Devices from Apple with iOS 7 or higher can be paired via USB cable to the infotainment system of the truck, giving access to Siri voice controls, as well as Apple Maps, Apple Music, Phone, Messages, and a variety of third party apps. The Apple CarPlay support will be introduced in June 2017 and earlier versions of the infotainment system can be updated, if they have voice recognition. So, what’s the next step – self-driving functions in trucks?

This makes Mercedes-Benz a trendsetter when it comes to smartphone integration for truck drivers. Apple CarPlay™ is available as of now in conjunction with the Multimedia Radio Touch radio system in the current models of the Mercedes-Benz Actros, Antos and Arocs. It allows the driver to safely and conveniently use his iPhone® and a variety of apps while on the move. For maximum compatibility with Android smartphones, the Multimedia Radio Touch can also be used with "MirrorLink™" - the counterpart to Apple CarPlay™. Four menus are available to the driver via the Multimedia Radio Touch. He or she may choose between the radio, media, call or connect menu. As soon as the driver chooses the connect menu and connects his smartphone via the USB slot, a selection of apps will be displayed via CarPlay™ or MirrorLink™. With Apple CarPlay™, the following apps are available to the driver: Telephone, music, maps, news, iTunes®, podcasts and audio books, as well as further accredited apps. Thanks to the advanced voice function, the driver can control the connect menu via Siri® and can, for example, easily and safely make telephone calls while driving. Or can navigate from his or her point of departure to desired destination via the Apple maps app, just by using the voice command. Thanks to MirrorLink™, drivers with Android smartphones can use the Multimedia Radio Touch radio system as well. As soon as the driver connects his smartphone with the MirrorLink™ by the connect menu he gets access to his apps. On the dashboard display of the radio system, he can see and use his apps via touchscreen. The connect menu of the Multimedia Radio Touch and his voice recognition allows for convenient and driver-friendly use of the smartphone that is also safe while driving. The Mercedes-Benz driver can thus experience the world of iOS and Android in their truck while on the move, too.

Raghu Krishnan reports. IMAGE: Priyanka Chopra grooves to her version of I Can't Make You Love Me. It's not just Apple Music, Google Play Music is also taking on local rivals like Gaana and Saavn in India. Following in the footsteps of iPhone maker Apple, technology giant Google has launched its subscription-based music streaming service in India -- a move that aims to build loyalty among the subscribers to remain in its ecosystem, and take on local rivals like Gaana and Saavn. The multinational company's move to charge a monthly subscription for Google Play Music also underscores a shift, that Indian customers are likely to pay for a service than consume it with advertisements. Google Play Music, launched this week, is priced at Rs 89 a month, compared to Rs 120 for Apple Music. Apple, however, has a student plan at Rs 60 a month, which looks to engage the first-time users. "With Google Play Music subscription, Indian subscribers can listen to their favourite music across a variety of languages, including Hindi, English, Tamil and more. This music can be accessed from any device with your Google Account," said Elias Roman, lead product manager, Google Play Music, in a statement. "To make the experience deeply personalised, we've plugged into Google's understanding of context and machine learning to recommend the right music at the right moment based on each listener's preference, place and activity," said Roman. Apple Music: So far, so good Google -- which dominates India's internet market as most users come online on smartphones that run on its Android platform -- is keen to protect its turf. Its music service is also available on Apple's iOS platform and on desktop computers, suggesting an ongoing battle between the two technology giants for dominance in the Indian market. Indian music streaming services Gaana and Saavn have a paid subscription model, but they also earn revenue by offering free streaming of music supported with advertisements. Both firms have huge libraries of local music. Apple and Google are dipping into their collection of international music to tap users. Bollywood a big hit with iTunes  Google's push with its music service in India comes in view of Apple's plan to use services as a bait to lure local users ahead of its big expansion in the country. Apple is offering its music services on Android devices, giving it a taste of its ecosystem. It is locally assembling its affordable iPhone SE in the country, which it wants to position as an aspirational smartphone for young Indian users. Apple has also begun streaming its music on the entertainment platform of cab aggregator Ola and reach out to its over 25 million customers. 10 must-have apps for your smartphone Raghu Krishnan Source: Tags: Saavn, Google Play Music, India, Gaana, Raghu Krishnan Share this Write a Comment Print this article   ALSO READ MOST RECENT     iTunes in India: Worth your time and money?

Following the footpath of Facebook, Instagram, and even Whatsapp. The iPhone maker has surprisingly launched a clone app called Apple Clips but with another angle. Apple launched this app, in an attempt at making a video editing app that works without any social angle to it. This app is developed by Apple and supports around 36 languages worldwide. Saying this, it is exclusive to iOS, that means you can use this on your iPhones and iPads alone. Clips have lots of interesting features ranging from live titling, facial analysis tool, and much more. In today's article, we will be guiding you through to use this app in a more effective way. Getting Started! In order to create a clip, you either need videos or photos, right? In this case, you can import from your Camera and stitch them or you can take photos or shoot videos in-app. This app shoots video in a square format which is 1080x1080 just like Instagram. So if you are importing videos, make sure the dimensions are right otherwise, you might miss out information. Also, you can swap between camera views by tapping the camera icons. Shoot it: Open the Clips app on your smartphone. In default, it will open the camera screen, where you can easily switch from photo to video to your library, just by tapping it in the bottom of the screen. Live titles: Next up is the Live title as I mentioned above. Press the red button to record and your words will appear on screen as you speak. It's worth mentioning here that, you need to speak somewhat slowly and clearly. Add filters to make it funnier: Just like other apps, Apple Clips also have eight different filters ranging from comic book to ink. You can apply this to both photos and videos. Overlays, if you need: There are overlays available in this app including time stamps, speech bubbles that you can tap to add to your photo or video. Once added, you can re-size and edit the text. Over 18 statements and shapes available that you can place wherever you want. If you want to remove, press 'X' to delete. When you swipe to the left, you will see limited emojis as well. You can also add that on your clips too. Intro and End card: Then the last one is full-screen animated posters, that can be used as end card or intro in your videos. Editing your clip is easier now: You can also trim the videos easily by tapping on the clip in the timeline. Then tap the scissor icon to edit the video as per your wish. Add some beat to it: Once you did with the video, you can also add music from your playlist or Apple's specially curated soundtracks. You can add music just by tapping the music note on the top right corner. Share it: You can share your Clip using Messages or through your choice of social network apps including YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram.

"Starting with iOS 10.3, Apple has started alerting users when they open a 32-bit app on iOS. The pop up notification reads that the app must be updated by the developer or else it may not work with future versions of iOS," tech website 9to5mac.com reported on Monday. The tech giant started supporting 64-bit applications with the launch of the iPhone 5s in September 2013. The company also asked developers to submit new apps with 64-bit support since February 2015 and app updates starting June 2015. Last month, Apple has officially released iOS 10.3 update that has major updates regarding its newly launched AirPods, WiFi calling and SiriKit. Other minor updates include new security features and a new iCloud section under the Apple ID Settings menu. The new section shows a breakdown of cloud storage usage. This feature also shows which apps use iCloud.

There may not be as much choice as smartphones when it comes to tablets, but there are still a number of decisions to be made if you're in the market for one. If you are reading this feature it is likely you have already decided on the platform, disregarding Android and Windows for iOS, and you are now trying to figure out what size iPad is the right one for you and which one fits into how much you want to spend. Apple offers a number of iPad options - iPad mini 4, new iPad 9.7, iPad Pro 9.7 and the iPad Pro 12.9. The tablets range from 7.9-inch displays to 12.9-inches in size. The iPad mini 2 and iPad Air 2 have been officially discontinued by Apple, but are still widely available, so we've included them all so you can see the differences between them and decide which is the right one for you and your budget. Quick summary The iPad mini 2 is for those who want a small Apple tablet but don't have the cash to splash on the newest model. If you are happy to sacrifice the latest specs and features, the iPad mini 2 gives you iOS on a budget. It has officially been discontinued by Apple as of March 2017, but it's still widely available. The iPad mini 4 is for those who want a small Apple tablet with many of the latest specs and features. You'll need a little more cash for the iPad mini 4 but you get a few extra features, like Touch ID, and a more powerful device. The iPad Air 2 has now been discontinued and replaced by the new iPad 9.7. About the only reason to buy the iPad Air 2 is if you can find it significantly cheaper than the new iPad.  The new iPad 9.7 replaces the iPad Air 2, offering much the same design, but slightly updated specs. Its launch price is cheaper too and it's cheaper than the iPad Pro, so if you want a big iPad but aren't fussed by the Pencil support, this is the model to pick. The iPad Pro 9.7 is Apple's most powerful and feature-rich tablet yet. It is the iPad for those that want all the features of the larger iPad Pro but in a smaller and more compact format, along with some additional extras no other iPad offers. The iPad Pro is the largest and most expensive iPad available, as well as one of the most powerful. It is for those that want to do more on their tablet than just watching movies and browsing the web, and for those that not only have the budget to warrant this model but also the desire for something bigger than the 9.7-inch model. Apple Apple iPad mini 2 Dimensions: 200 x 134.7 x 7.5mm, 331g Display: 7.9-inches, 2048 x 1536 (326ppi)  Storage: 32GB (Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi & Cellular) Battery: Up to 10 hours Colours: Silver, Space Grey Price: Buy it from £264 on Amazon UK, or $249 on Amazon US The iPad mini 2 is the cheapest way to get your hands on an Apple tablet as it is now a few years old and has been succeeded by the iPad mini 4. It is the smallest iPad available, though not the slimmest or lightest. The iPad mini 2 was discontinued in March 2017, but it's still widely available. The iPad mini 2 comes in silver and space grey colour options so you miss out on the gold option and there are also a couple of other things lacking, such as Touch ID and Apple Pay, as well as an anti-reflective coating on the display. There is also no slo-mo video capability or burst mode. The A7 chip and M7 motion coprocessor sit under the hood and you'll find a 1.2-megapixel front camera, coupled with a 5-megapixel rear camera, the latter of which is a slight downgrade from the iPad mini 4. Apple iPad mini 2 review Apple Apple iPad mini 4 Dimensions: 203.2 x 134.8 x 6.1mm, 298.8g Display: 7.9-inches, 2048 x 1536 (326ppi) Storage: 128GB (Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi & Cellular) Battery: Up to 10 hours Colours: Silver, Space Grey, Gold Price (RRP): From £419 to £549, buy it from £342 on Amazon UK, or $408 on Amazon US The iPad mini 4 is the newer and more expensive addition to the small iPad club. It is ever so slightly larger than the iPad mini 2, but it is slimmer and lighter and although it has the same size and resolution display, you get the addition of a fully laminated screen and an anti-reflective coating. There is a newer, faster chip powering the iPad mini 4 with the A8 processor and M8 motion coprocessor on board, as well as the addition of an 128GB storage option and gold finish. Officially, Apple only offers 128GB storage now, although older models are available at lower storage levels. In terms of other extras, Touch ID is included on the iPad mini 4, as is Apple Pay compatibility, burst mode and slo-mo video. The only other difference to the older iPad mini 2 is the bump to an 8-megapixel rear camera. Apple iPad mini 4 review Best iPad mini cases: Protect your 7.9-inch Apple tablet Apple Apple iPad Air 2 Dimensions: 240 x 169.5 x 6.1mm, 437g Display: 9.7-inches, 2048 x 1536 (264ppi) Storage: 32GB, 128GB (Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi & Cellular) Battery: Up to 10 hours Colours: Silver, Space Grey, Gold Price: Buy it from £378 on Amazon UK, or $419 on Amazon US The iPad Air 2 has now been discontinued, replaced with the cheaper and slightly more powerful new iPad 9.7. There is still stock of the iPad Air around, but check the prices carefully - the new iPad might be the cheaper option. A faster A8X and M8 motion coprocessor sits under the hood than the smaller iPad mini 4, but you get the same colour options as the iPad mini 4, as well as the same cameras and features. Touch ID, Apple Pay, burst mode, slo-mo video and the fully laminated display with anti-reflective coating are all therefore present on the iPad Air 2, but you miss out on Apple Pencil compatibility, a True Tone display, higher resolution cameras and stereo speakers, all of which are found on the newer 9.7-inch iPad Pro model.  Apple iPad Air 2 review Apple Apple iPad  Dimensions: 240 x 169.5 x 7.5mm, 469g Display: 9.7-inches, 2048 x 1536 (264ppi) Storage: 32GB, 128GB (Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi & Cellular) Battery: Up to 10 hours Colours: Silver, Space Grey, Gold Price (RRP): From £339 to £559 The new iPad replaces the iPad Air 2 and is simply called iPad. It sticks to much the same design as the iPad Air 2 and the iPad Pro, although it's slightly thicker, which is probably down to the fact there is no fully laminated display or anti-reflective coating. This probably also accounts for the lower pricing than the old iPad Air 2. The 2017 iPad offers the same display size and resolution as the iPad Air 2 however, though it steps up to the A9 chip under its hood, giving a speed boost over the iPad Air 2, even if it is still a step below the iPad Pro models. It also still misses out on a few of the iPad Pro's other features. There is an 8-megapixel rear camera and 1.2-megapixel front snapper on the new iPad, Touch ID is on board as you would expect and it comes in silver, gold and space grey colour options so no rose gold. The new Apple iPad's biggest selling point is its pricing however: at £339 for the Wi-Fi 32GB model, it's the cheapest iPad model that Apple offers. New Apple iPad 2017 review Apple Apple iPad Pro 9.7 Dimensions: 240 x 169.5 x 6.1mm, 437g Display: 9.7-inches, 2048 x 1536 (264ppi), True Tone Storage: 32GB, 128GB, 256GB (Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi & Cellular) Battery: Up to 10 hours Colours: Silver, Space Grey, Gold, Rose Gold Price (RRP): From £549 to £849, buy it from £529 on Amazon UK, or $510 on Amazon US The iPad Pro 9.7 is exactly the same size as the iPad Air 2 and it offers the same size display and resolution too, meaning the same pixel density. It does add a couple of new technologies to the mix however, including a True Tone and wide colour gamut display, as well as Apple Pencil compatibility. The iPad Pro 9.7 takes its design cues from the larger iPad Pro, meaning you'll get the Smart Connector and four-speaker setup with this device. It also adds the option of a rose gold finish and a 256GB storage option. As you might expect, the iPad Pro 9.7 has the latest A9X processor under its hood like the larger iPad Pro, but it also significantly improves the camera experience compared to the iPad Air 2 with a 12-megapixel rear camera and a 5-megapixel front camera, both of which offer flash. Apple iPad Pro 9.7 review Apple iPad Pro 9.7 vs iPad Pro 12.9: What's the difference? Best iPad Pro 9.7 cases: Protect your new Apple tablet Apple Apple iPad Pro 12.9 Dimensions: 305.7 x 220.6 x 6.9mm, 713g Display: 12.9-inches, 2732 x 2048 (264ppi) Storage: 32GB, 128GB, 256GB (Wi-Fi) or 128GB, 256GB (Wi-Fi & Cellular) Battery: Up to 10 hours Colours: Silver, Space Grey, Gold Price (RRP): From £729 to £1029, buy it from £662 on Amazon UK, or $624 on Amazon US The iPad Pro marked a new tablet territory for Apple with its 12.9-inch display. It will be far too big for some but for others, it will be the tablet they were waiting for. The display technology is the same as the iPad mini 4 and iPad Air 2 meaning it doesn't offer the True Tone and wide colour gamut screen of the iPad Pro 9.7. You'll also find the same cameras and other features such as Touch ID and Apple Pay compatibility as the new iPad, iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 4 so it also misses out on the higher resolution cameras found in the iPad Pro 9.7. The iPad Pro has a faster processor than all the other iPads available, except its newer, smaller brother, with the A9X and M9 combination under the hood. It is also compatible with the Apple Pencil and it will offer a range of software features, including Adobe, that the other iPads, again except the smaller iPad Pro, don't.

A new report from Israeli website The Verifier claims that the iPhone 8 may feature Apple's Smart Connector for wireless charging and for other accessories such as VR/AR headsets. Apple first introduced the Smart Connector in the 12.9' iPad Pro, which uses the connector for accessories such as Apple's external keyboard. The Smart Connector in the iPad Pro provides both data and power for external accessories and connects to them via magnets. The report also claims that AirPlay and new Apple TV hardware will play a key role in Apple's AR/VR vision. Also Read: Samsung Galaxy A7 2017 review: Ticks almost all the right boxes The existence of the Smart Connector on the iPhone 8 hints at the possibility that Apple could introduce new peripherals for the iPhone 8 this year such as a VR headset or smart glasses which could help provide an augmented reality experience. Last year Apple CEO Tim Cook had said he was more bullish about AR compared to VR - "My own view is that augmented reality is the larger of the two, probably by far, because this gives the capability for both of us to sit and be very present talking to each other, but also have other things visually for both of us to see," Cook said. "Maybe it's something we're talking about, maybe it's someone else here that is not here, present, but could be made to appear to be present with us. So there's a lot of really cool things there." After three years of waiting, Apple fans will finally see the introduction of an all new design with the iPhone 8. Leaks and rumours point towards an all glass bezel less-design that will drop Apple's trademark physical home button. The smartphone is also expected to feature a curved display. With the LG G6 and Samsung Galaxy S8 both introducing bezel less edge-to-edge displays, it is almost imperative for Apple to follow suit and reduce the iPhone's massive top and bottom bezels. Apple is also set to equip the iPhone 8 with an OLED screen after years of using IPS LCD panels in the previous iPhones. Additionally, Apple is also expected to follow in Samsung's footsteps and include an Iris scanner with the iPhone 8 which will allow users to unlock the iPhone 8 with their eyes. The iPhone 8 is also expected to come with 3D cameras. A few weeks ago, Korea's Economic Daily reported that the iPhone 8 will come with LG's Innotek dual lens cameras at the back.

American tech giant Apple has requested unauthorized shops in Vietnam to stop using its logo and trademarks and selling smuggled products. Vo Tran, Apple's legal representative in Vietnam, has sent a copyright infringement warning to several retailers in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, which have been accused of using the famous Apple logo and product names such as iPhone, iPad and MacBook, without permission. The notice, issued late last month, said these shops at times also sold unauthorized Apple products. The use of Apple logo and product names has misled customers that these shops are authorized retailers, Apple said, threatening to take legal action against violations. Trinh Thai Duong, owner of a mobile retail chain in Ho Chi Minh City, said he received a similar notice from Apple four years ago. Duong said he has been running his business as normal after complying with the request. A lot of Apple products retailed in Vietnam are smuggled from Hong Kong and China, which are usually available sooner than the official ones distributed by Apple's official partners. Smuggled phones can also be cheaper. Apple reportedly opened a subsidiary company in Vietnam in late 2015, allowing it to import and distribute cellphones in Vietnam. Its products are officially imported and sold by a few local tech giants, including FPT and The Gioi Di Dong (Mobile World).

Just like when Apple was first rumored to forego the 3.5mm headphone jack on the iPhone 7. Although many would know by now that Apple aims the iPhone 8 to be a revolutionary device, any ludicrous claim about it is not exactly that surprising. By now, it is not a secret that the tenth anniversary iPhone is said to have wireless charging. However, it would seem that Apple is still sorting out the heat generated by the wireless charging feature. This is perhaps why it is now rumored that the high-end iPhone will include a Smart Connector instead of a full-blown wireless charging module. Apple Smart Connector features According to The Verifier, the iPhone 8 will include that elusive Smart Connector, the same connector that was rumored on the iPhone 7 last year. Right now, the only iDevice with the said interface is the iPad Pro. The tablet uses the Smart Connector to charge and communicate with the tablet for various other features like an external keyboard. While there is no question that the iPhone 8 may be able to support this with the Smart Connector, it will also be used for virtual reality or augmented reality applications. iPhone 8 concept by Moh Slah (via youtube.com) As mentioned, apart from charging the phone, the Smart Connector will also be used for VR or AR applications, with more emphasis on the latter. Apple has been putting a lot of its resources into AR research for the past couple of years. In fact, the company has many a number of startup company acquisitions and companies related to AR in the past few years. Camera for AR/VR With respect to AR or VR, there have been a lot of talks lately about how Apple is going to achieve this. Of course, working closely with a number of newly acquired AR/VR companies is one thing. The other thing is the actual hardware of the technology. As reported many times before, the iPhone 8 will be equipped with a 3D sensor that will not only be used for facial recognition but with AR/VR applications as well. Unfortunately, Apple is still having issues marrying it up with the OLED display due to some difficulties in material bonding. In addition to the 3D sensor, another important hardware on the iPhone 8 are the rear cameras. According to a Twitter post, it seems that the camera arrangement on the iPhone 8 will be vertical instead of horizontal. While this is not exactly new, it is said that this arrangement will make it easier for the hardware to use the cameras for VR or AR applications. My guess. #iPhone8 #iPhoneX #iPhoneEdition pic.twitter.com/JeQDMeWztw — Benjamin Geskin (@VenyaGeskin1) April 7, 2017 iPhone 8 release date With regards to the iPhone 8’s release date, many now believe that it will be much later this year. This is due to reports last week that Apple is still having a number of issues with the assembly, the display being one of them. However, there are still rumors that the phone will go on pre-order the same time the iPhone 7 upgrades are announced. The iPhone 8 is said to carry one hefty price tag. In all the rumors so far, the upcoming phone is said to be priced somewhere north of $1,000. This is mainly because of all the new features included in the design. Features like the new curved OLED display, 3D facial recognition, and others have added to the price of the phone. All in all, these bits of information are nothing but rumors. Readers are urged to take these claims with a grain of salt. Apple is yet to release, although very unlikely, an official statement about these claims.

By Deepali Moray | Published: April 10, 2017 9:35 AM IST Email @deepalimoray comments Tags: Apple Apple iPhone 8 Augmented Reality wireless charging News For the upcoming anniversary edition iPhone 8, Apple might introduce a new type of connector that could possibly give the smartphone augmented reality capabilities and also aid in charging. The word on Apple introducing a new type of charging port had been doing the rounds before the launch of the iPhone 7. However, that didn’t materialize. Now, given that this year’s iPhone is already poised to be one of the most premium, feature-rich smartphones by Apple; the ‘Smart Connector for AR and Charging’ might finally see the light of the day. It is worth mentioning that the magnetic Smart Connector was first introduced on the 12.9-inch iPad Pro in 2015. However, it is only aiding in charging the device till now. If the latest rumor from Israeli site The Verifier is to be believed, the next-gen Smart Connector will come with potential AR or VR applications. While the current smart connector is capable of charging the device, it is not known how much data can travel through it per second. Apple CEO Tim Cook has openly talked about the company’s interest in exploring augmented reality technology. Recent reports have also claimed that the iPhone 8 will be equipped with specialized camera lens and technology that will not only aid in facial recognition but also help in enhancing the mapping experience. If one takes into consideration the purported smart connector, it could mean that there will be additional peripherals for the iPhone 8 which could provide the augmented reality experience. Samsung, with its Galaxy S8 lineup, introduced the DeX connector that allows one to achieve desktop experience from the smartphone. With the rumored smart connector, we might be able to see something similar for the iPhone 8, where users are able to connect the smartphone to a peripheral like a pair of glasses for the immersive experience. ALSO READ: Apple iPhone 8 leaked schematics hint at vertical dual-camera setup at the back In addition to the augmented reality experience, the connector is said to finally bring wireless charging capabilities to the iPhone. Following Samsung’s introduction of the wireless charging feature to its premium line of flagship smartphones, iPhone users have long-begged for similar capability for the Apple phones. This year, as the Apple iPhone clocks in its 10th year of existence, it is expected that the company will introduce a newly designed line of iPhones, including a special anniversary edition model which will also be the most premium version of all. For this variant, widely referred to as the iPhone 8, it is likely that the company will ditch the physical Touch ID button and instead place it beneath the display. The display will be edge-to-edge and measure 5.8-inch.  ALSO READ: Apple iPhone 8 leak yet again hints at 3D sensing camera technology In terms of other specifications; recently leaked schematics suggest that Apple will place the dual rear camera module on the iPhone 8 vertically. While the dual camera setup was introduced with last year’s iPhone 7 Plus, the camera positioning is horizontal. Furthermore, this year’s lineup will include successors to the iPhone 7 lineup – the iPhone 7s and the iPhone 7s Plus – all of which will feature Apple iPad Pro-like True Tone displays.

Ahead of its release, Apple put the iOS 10.3 update into beta for developers and those in the free Beta Software Program. The iOS 10.3 beta helped Apple gain valuable feedback about potential bugs and problems. Of course, that didn’t prevent iOS 10.3 problems from emerging in the final release. The bug list included unspecified issues that ultimately forced Apple to halt the iOS 10.3 updates for the iPhone 5 and iPhone 5c. Apple’s replaced iOS 10.3 with an iOS 10.3.1 update, a tiny maintenance update. iOS 10.3.1 didn’t go through a beta, probably because the update is just a few MB in size. And while iOS 10.3.1 might be tiny, it too is causing issues for some iPhone, iPad and iPod touch users. With that in mind we want to take a look at the most important things iPhone, iPad and iPod touch owners need to know about iOS 10.3.1 problems as we push away from the update’s release. This roundup takes a look at the current state of iOS 10.3.1 problems, shows you potential fixes for the most common iOS 10.3.1 issues, and provides some resources that could come in handy if you start to see trouble with your version of iOS 10.3.1. It also takes a look at what’s next from Apple in terms of bug fixes. iOS 10.3.1 Problems It’s early but we’re already hearing about some of the iOS 10.3.1 problems iPhone and iPad users are encountering after installing Apple’s brand new update. The early list includes the usual suspects. iPhone and iPad users are encountering installation errors, weird battery drain, Wi-Fi issues, busted Bluetooth, Touch ID, Siri, and some issues with third-party applications including Facebook. Apple’s discussion forums, Reddit, and social media sites like Twitter are starting to fill up with various complaints about the iOS 10.3.1 update and we expect the list to grow as more people find and install the new software. It seem like Apple didn't fixed the major battery drain in 10.3-10.3.1 update. I swear, my battery wasn't behaving like that back in iOS 9! — Ian Kelly (@ianjsays) April 7, 2017 Why i feel like my battery is draining way quicker after updating to ios 10.3.1? 😐 — SΛRΛΠ (@SaranMufc_) April 8, 2017 @Apple @AppleSupport IOS 10.3GM and 10.3.1 both seem to have high battery drain can you address please. Iphone 7+ thanks. — Myklo (@3JustMike3) April 4, 2017 @My_AppleGadgets experiencing battery drain with ios 10.3.1 — Kurt Gilchrist® (@Kurtgilchrist) April 4, 2017 Sensing that iOS 10.3.1 may have introduced a few Bluetooth reliability issues. Anyone else? — Michael Firth (@TechFirth) April 10, 2017 It’s virtually impossible to predict what kind of performance you’ll see on your phone or tablet and this is precisely why we always recommend doing a some prep work before installing an iOS release, even before a small release like iOS 10.3.1. We’ve put together a step-by-step process that will take you through the pre-iOS 10.3.1 installation process we used on our iPhones and iPads. At the bare minimum you’ll want to make a backup of your device. This way you won’t lose any important files. Where to Find Feedback As we push away from the iOS 10.3.1 release date it’s important to keep tabs on the update’s performance. Part of this is monitoring your version of the update for issues. Part of it is digging into feedback from other iOS 10.3.1 users. Digging into some of this iOS 10.3.1 feedback will alert you to potential iOS 10.3.1 problems and it’ll help you find potential benefits of the iOS 10.3.1 update. To start you off, we’ve put together some reasons to and not to install the iOS 10.3.1 update on your device right now. If you’re on the fence about making the move to iOS 10.3.1, start there. We’ve also starting putting together our own impressions of the iOS 10.3.1 update. We’ve started with the iPhone 7, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6, iPhone 5, and the iPad. As always, we also recommend keeping an eye on YouTube, Apple’s discussion forums, social media sites like Twitter/Facebook, and the MacRumors forums for additional feedback about the current version of iOS 10. How to Fix iOS 10.3.1 Problems If you do run into an iOS 10.3.1 problem on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch, there’s no need to panic. Chances are, you’ll be able to fix your issue from the confines of your home or office. Before you take your iPhone or iPad down to an Apple Store or carrier store you’ll want to try and fix your issue(s) manually. We’ve put together a list of the most common iOS 10 problems and fixes and it’s a great place to start if you’re in trouble. We also recently released a list of tips that could help you improve performance. Some of these will take seconds to complete, others are a little more involved. If you’re unable to find a fix for your issue there, you should go to Apple’s discussion forums for help. There are tons of helpful users there. If Apple’s forums don’t help, you can get in contact with Apple Support via Twitter or the company’s website. If that doesn’t work, schedule an appointment to see a Genius at a local Apple Store. You Can’t Downgrade We’ve got some bad news for those of you dealing with iOS 10.3.1 problems. Apple is no longer signing off on iOS 10.3 or iOS 10.2.1 which means you can no longer downgrade from iOS 10.3.1 in an effort to improve your device’s performance. This is a permanent change and it means those of you who are experiencing iOS 10.3.1 problems are on your own. Apple’s next iOS update is probably a few weeks away. Those of you who haven’t made the move to iOS 10.3.1 yet should take note. Once you upgrade, there’s no going back to whatever version of iOS you’re on. For more on the downgrade process, take a look at our detailed walkthrough. It’ll help you prepare for next time. What’s Next A new version of iOS 10.3 is confirmed. The iOS 10.3.2 update is official and it’s currently in beta for developers and those in the free Beta Software Program. The update arrived alongside new beta software updates for tvOS, watchOS, and macOS. The iOS 10.3.2 update appears to be a maintenance release which means it will likely have critical bug fixes and security patches on board. Unfortunately, we don’t know when iOS 10.3.2 will be released to the general public. Apple typically releases several beta updates before pushing the final product. If you’re dealing with an iOS 10.3 problem, make sure you keep a close eye on iOS 10.3.2 and the iOS 10.3.2 beta. 4 Reasons Not to Install iOS 10.3.1 & 7 Reasons You Should Install iOS 10.3.1 If You Want Better Security   1 / 11 If you value your security, you'll want to seriously consider downloading the iOS 10.3.1 update on your iPhone or iPad.  iOS 10.3.1 brings a single security patch for a potential Wi-Fi exploit. But if you failed to install iOS 10.3, your iOS 10.3.1 update will bring its monster list of patches as well.  The iOS 10.3 update delivered over 60 known patches for potential exploits. That's substantial, even for a milestone upgrade. The previous version of iOS 10, iOS 10.2.1, brought 14 known patches. Among them is a patch for a Safari ransomware bug that scammers used to extort iOS users who viewed pornography on their device.  These patches enhance the security on your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch making them ideal for those of you who store sensitive files/data on your device. Most people do. If you skipped the iOS 10.2.1 update and/or the iOS 10.2 update, know that iOS 10.3.1 brings their security patches with it as well. Again, the iOS 10.2.1 update had 14 important patches on board. You can see them all right here.  If you failed to install Apple's iOS 9.3.5 update, iOS 10.3.1 will also bring the three crucial security patches it delivered last year. These patch up serious security problems that could potentially expose your calls, contacts, texts, and emails. If security is important to you, iOS 10.3.1 is probably worth a download right now.   1 / 11 7 Responses 03/30/2017 DopplerDon Barker Reply I installed (or did I) iOS 10.3 and now my phone (6S) will not get past the updating iCloud settings screen despite hard reboots x3. 04/03/2017 jenny Reply My phone keeps searching,fixed it just within 4days its searching again 04/05/2017 Yacine Reply Hello i have mutch problems touch id very slow and the 4g data problems you turn on very slow not fast that all i can say please Apple fix this i have a iPhone 6s 128gb Apple give updates but nothing working good i hope fix this message app little bit slow thanks!!!! 04/07/2017 Josh Orlando Reply I’m currently extracting 10.3.1 as I write this comment since my phone crashed while trying to install last night. First time having any issues with any iOS updates, so I will take precaution going forward. Luckily I backed up my phone not too long ago. 04/07/2017 Michele Reply My 7 Plus was stable. My phone advised there was an update so I went forward with it. Now my Bluetooth isn’t working, all my messages have been erased and none of the messages buttons work (like send for example), when I swipe up from the bottom to access my Control Panel is completely locks up my phone, and even a factory reset with backup restore didn’t work. I am trying a complete reset now with setup as a new phone to see if I can resolve my issues. I will update once done. 04/07/2017 Michele Reply Had to do a full factory reset with start as a new phone options. Appears to have fixed the issue but lost a lot of information. No big deal tho. At least the phone is fine. 04/09/2017 Brooke Reply Updated to 10.3.1 last night and less than 12 hours later my 6 plus has died. Will not turn on and can get no response from it.

A report from Israeli site - The Verifier says that the upcoming iPhone may feature Apple's Smart Connector for inductive wireless charging and can also be used as a VR/AR accessory. For now, Apple uses the Smart Connector only on the iPad Pro section. According to the news report, this special Smart Connector may come on the next-gen iPhone with OLED display. Like other rumors, even this Smart Connector feature has been talked about for a long time. Last year, leaks regarding iPhone 7 stated that iPhone 7 Plus may come with this option placed on the back of it. Also Read: The iPhone 8 to cost less than $1,000: Report The latest report also says that Smart Connector will be helpful for the purpose of wireless charging for the next iPhone 8. That is, the company is developing a Smart Connector variant which offers both the wireless charging and AR features in it. It is already mentioned earlier that only iPad Pro's are using Smart Connector in it currently. In this device, this feature is designed as a port which provides power and data connection to few accessories like keyboards. This was initially introduced in 2015 as a magnetic Smart Connector for 12.9-inch iPad Pro. Few sources claim that the magnetic strength present in the Smart Connector is not ideal to make full use of it. Also Read: Apple iPhone 8 to feature Liquid Metal Glass Back But one should not forget the fact that Apple offered Lighting port on those devices which can be used to connect the iPhone to AR or VR accessories. The Verifier also states that new Apple TV hardware and AirPlay will play a role in Apple's VR/AR vision. Since it is just a rumor, we have to wait and watch until company officially announces it. For now, we know that iPhone 8 will come with an edge-to-edge OLED display, waterproof features, a dual-camera on the back and wireless charging technology.

This particular source has provided MacRumors with reliable information in the past. Apple's iconic Fifth Avenue store in New York City The person did not share any further details, but it's possible that Ebro Darden, one of three Beats 1 radio anchors, could broadcast at least some of his shows at the Fifth Avenue store once it reopens. Currently, he appears to broadcast from a studio in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan. Apple Fifth Avenue, known for its iconic glass cube entrance, has been closed for renovations since January 20. The redesigned store will reportedly have over twice as much square footage, so there will likely be more than enough space for a dedicated Beats 1 broadcasting booth alongside the sales floor. Beats 1 radio anchor Ebro Darden, based in New York City Beats 1 is Apple's internet-based radio station, broadcasted around the clock in over 100 countries around the world. It launched in tandem with Apple Music in June 2015. In addition to Darden, the station is anchored by former BBC Radio 1 host Zane Lowe, based out of Los Angeles, and London's Julie Adenuga. Apple Music executive Larry Jackson recently described Beats 1 as "the biggest radio station in the world," and he claimed there is no other station in existence that has as many concurrent listeners at any given time. Beats 1 can be listened to through iTunes on Mac or PC, or in the Apple Music app on iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, and Apple Watch. Listening is free, with no Apple Music subscription required. Apple has not indicated when its Fifth Avenue store will reopen, but renovations are likely to continue for several months. In addition to more space and a Beats 1 broadcasting area, the store will likely feature Apple's next-generation retail layout, in line with stores in Brooklyn, Brussels, Paris, San Francisco, and elsewhere.

And if they want the Beats studio, fine, I don't think it will make much difference, but it won't hurt them much either. But it's frustrating that apparently someone at Apple realized they needed a new radio studio before someone else at Apple realized they needed a new Mac Pro.

Apple makes more off Apple Music than the Mac Pro. 2. Apple can do more than one thing at a time. 3. Your priorities don't apply to the whole world. [doublepost=1491779839][/doublepost] It illustrates Apple going offtrack. It would be like McDonalds selling powerful laptops for professionals running their own Linux distribution. Except McDonalds doesn't make laptops, but Apple DOES own Beats. [doublepost=1491780009][/doublepost] See, there you missed it like Tim. Forest, meet trees. <tons of insufferable nonsense> If you want things to run differently, become CEO of Apple and change it. If you're that upset, choose a different company.

The company is expected to launch three iPhones this year including one with a 5.8 inch OLED display. A new report claims that while iPhone 8 pre-orders might open in September, they may not actually start shipping until “several weeks later.” The report comes from longtime Apple analyst Brian White of the investment banking firm Drexel Hamilton. He writes in his research note to investors that the firm’s contact “strongly believes” that the 5.8 inch iPhone 8 will be delayed by several weeks due to challenges related to the 3D sensing technology. Apple is therefore expected to start taking pre-orders for the handset in September but may not ship it for several weeks. The analyst mentions that Apple will be able to get the smartphone out well ahead of the lucrative holiday season. However, this assumption is based on the information available at this point in time. There’s still a long way to go until September and there’s every possibility that the situation could improve in the coming months. If that does happen, there would be no need for Apple to delay shipments after taking pre-orders. Another expected scenario is that the iPhone 8 might only be available in limited quantities initially with supply being gradually ramped up in the following months. None of this has been officially confirmed by Apple so take it all with a healthy dose of salt for now. Filed in Apple >Cellphones. Read more about iphone 8.
