Editorial Director at Mobile Nations, analyst at iMore, video and podcast host, you can follow him @reneritchie on Snapchat, Instagram, and Twitter. From 7% to 2.5% in one week flat — Welcome to the new Apple Store affiliate rate. Apple just announced via the iTunes Affiliate Newsletter that it's slashing App Store — app and in-app purchase — affiliate revenue from 7% to 2.5% effective May 1, 2017. Starting on May 1st 2017, commissions for all app and in-app content will be reduced from 7% to 2.5% globally. All other content types (music, movies, books, and TV) will remain at the current 7% commission rate in all markets. We will also continue to pay affiliate commissions on Apple Music memberships so there are many ways to earn commissions with the program. That's close to a two-thirds drop and with only one week's notice. Once-upon-a-time App Store affiliate revenue paid for a full-time app editor on iMore. It's dwindled since then, as paid apps gave way to fremium, but this, to quote our business team, is "soul crushing". We'll have to wait and see how it shakes out, but it's possible revenue will drop low enough it wouldn't even keep a full-time editor in instant coffee for the month. @natisho @reneritchie @MDMDeals No kidding it's going to hit me hard—gonna need to take a hard look at if it's worth it to run @MDMDeals anymore. Suspect I may not be 😕— Mark D Miller (@MarkDMill) April 24, 2017 Both the depth of the cut and the abruptness of the timeline are startling. A lot of websites, including iMore, have been increasingly turning to affiliate revenue to help shore up declines in ad revenue — and to get away from the more egregious ads. The same holds true for developers who have long used affiliate adds on their own apps to bolster their income. With Apple (and Amazon, by the way), slashing that affiliate revenue, it's going to make things even tougher. (Google, the other major online market, doesn't and never has offered affiliate revenue for Google Play.) So, yeah, this change in affilate commissions pretty much sucks. We don't rely on links alone (thankfully), but we'll be affected by it. pic.twitter.com/85V94DBPqQ— Federico Viticci (@viticci) April 24, 2017 While Apple initially ran the App Store at slightly above break-even, and used its 30% share of paid apps to support the huge percentage of free apps, App Store revenue has grown steadily over the years and has long since become a huge business in its own right. If the App Store were struggling, cuts would be easier to understand. But the reverse is true. That's led to the popular, if desperate, theory that Apple is doing this in advance of cutting its own revenue share from 30% down to 15% or 10% at WWDC 2017. That would explain the change, though not the abruptness. As much as that sounds like wishful thinking, it would at least reduce the pressure on developers. Though, if that was part of the reasoning, why not wait and announce the two together? Not really. Affiliates never worked for iPhone/iPad apps because of low prices anyway. https://t.co/zkoylDmqve— 👾Denys Zhadanov (@DenZhadanov) April 24, 2017 Either way, publications are also businesses and, if they can't financially justify it, they may reduce or eliminate app coverage, which would also hurt developers and customers alike. (At least for those who find app coverage valuable.) Given how out-of-the-blue this is, a lot is up in the air right now. We'll have to wait and see how it shakes out. If you're a developer or a pub that depends on App Store affiliate revenue, let me know how the change affects you.

I deliberately support sites like iMore and others by using affiliate links. I keep ads off due to malvertizing. I could see reducing the amount as the App Store has been making record sales, but not slashing it like this. 0 1 day ago Reply tnt4 Malvertizing... great word. 0 12 hours ago Reply returnmyjedi If this is a precursor to a cut in the revenue share of App purchases then at least it'll be sort of justified. If not it just comes across as being miserly, especially as Apple have given next to no notice for it. It'll be interesting to see how App coverage is handled on Apple sites from now on. Websites covering Android often have a more balanced view of Google Play apps due to the lack of an affiliate program, whilst many Apple sites seem to push paid apps more thanks to the slice of the revenue they get. 0 1 day ago Reply user7c "Websites covering Android often have a more balanced view of Google Play apps due to the lack of an affiliate program" This behaviour would be more beneficial to the consumer no? With the newly restructured App Store review and direct developer feedback mechanism, maybe Apple wants to direct people to their own app review / feedback forum instead of other outside websites like imore.

Sites such as this (and several others) are great promotors of Apple’s products, so why are Apple rewarding them by slashing one of their main income streams? Such sites also have great influence on how the public perceives Apple, so why deliberately antagonise them by gouging them for money that Apple really doesn’t need? And with only one week of notice! As an independent app developer I think it It is already too difficult for the average user to discover new apps. The App Store doesn’t have anywhere near enough space to promote every decent app, so this is where third party blogs and sites come in. Without them smaller developers such as myself will have far fewer opportunities for our apps to be brought to users’ attention. It doesn’t matter if Apple reduce their commission from 30% to 0% because this decision will mean that far fewer users hear about the apps, and so far fewer will be sold, which means that everyone will lose out. 0 22 hours ago Reply thundermustard The only time Rene criticizes Apple is when it cost him money. 0 19 hours ago Reply Rene Ritchie I'm paid either way. So really, it's just the Apple mouse I hate. 0 12 hours ago Reply cardfan Strange move. I wouldn't think referrals would be a huge percentage for Apple and they'd be happy to get them. I hardly ever view the app store without first reading an article that leads me to it. Perhaps it'll make sense after WWDC but as Rene mentions that could have waited. Makes me wonder who'd really want to partner with Apple when they do stuff like this. 0 17 hours ago Reply user7c Both Rene and commenters pointed out that others like Google and recently Amazon do not pay affiliate revenue, maybe Apple do not want to be zeroed out - to avoid being accused of paying for reviews? 0 16 hours ago Reply CylonJason The problem with this article is that it doesn't explain what App Store affiliate revenue is and how it works, to the average person who doesn't know.

When he's not bothering his chihuahuas, Mikah spends entirely too much time and money on HomeKit products. You can follow him on Twitter at @mikahsargent if you're so inclined. Putting together a smart home takes time, money, patience, and a little elbow grease. I've been building out my smart home (I'm still not entirely sold on that term) for quite awhile. I've got smart lights, smart plugs, smart motion sensors, smart fans, a smart garage door … I'll save you the time and sum things up: I've got a boat-load of smart gadgetry in my home. And as I've built things out, set up automations, cut back, expanded, swapped out products, upgraded devices, and more, I've come to realize there are a few apps, tools, and products that have made my smart home experience a delight. Whether this will be your first foray into smart home territory or you're a seasoned home automator who's just itching to expand, I've put together a list of five things every smart home owner should have to make their experience all the more delightful and all the more useful! 1. An app to control your smart home No one smart-home-product manufacturer has been successful in providing everything you need for your smart home setup. As you start to build out your automated home, you're going to be buying products from different companies and you're going to need a way to tie them all together (as best you can). If you're rocking an iPhone or other iOS device, I recommend limiting your smart-home purchases to HomeKit-enabled accessories, because you'll be able to control all your devices simply and securely with your voice (via Siri) and your iOS device (via HomeKit). If you're not rocking an iPhone (or just want to buy non-HomeKit-enabled accessories), worry not! There are some apps and services that can help you tie things together. Home The Home app for iOS is a fantastic (and simple) way to control all your HomeKit-enabled accessories. You can use the app to install new HomeKit-enabled accessories, monitor your home's status, turn on and off lights, activate scenes, adjust devices in individual rooms, set up automations, view HomeKit-enabled cameras, invite guests to control your HomeKit-enabled accessories, and more. I won't go into too much detail here on what the Home app can do and how it works because I've already done that! You can learn everything you need to know about HomeKit and the iOS Home app by clicking below: Learn more Elgato Eve Not only does Elgato make a fan-friggin'-tastic set of HomeKit-enabled smart home products, the company makes one of the best third-party apps for controlling your HomeKit home. Where iOS's Home app is a simple way to get going with your smart home, the Eve app lets you monitor and control your home in great detail and with incredible nuance. When I needed to figure out a way to have my lights turn on as soon as a motion sensor was triggered and turn off again after a certain period of time, Elgato's Eve app allowed me to do just that. The app also provides detailed information about power usage, charts contact sensor interactions, motion, and more. It's a full-featured app for a person who wants more out of their HomeKit-enabled smart home. Free - Download now Wink As promised, the Wink app is one of the apps I mentioned that can help tie various smart home products together regardless of their HomeKit compatibility. Before I had a Wink Hub 2 in my home, I was able to use the Wink app to control my August Smart Lock, Ecobee thermostat, iHome SmartPlug, Nest Cam, and Philips Hue Lights. The app provides simple, individual control of supported smart home devices as well as smart home scenes (Wink calls them Shortcuts) and automations (Wink calls them Robots). You can set up a Good Night Shortcut, for example that turns off all the lights in your home and turns up the heat on the thermostat. A Robot, on the other hand, would let you set up an automation that, say, turned on the lights in your garage as you arrived home. You won't get the same level of integration as you can with HomeKit and the iOS Home app, but the Wink app does a pretty good job of bringing together various devices all in one place. Free - Download now Home Assistant Home Assistant isn't for everyone, but it's one of the most all-encompassing home automation tools I've come across. Running on Python 3, this home automation platform auto-discovers loads of supported devices and gives you access and control as soon as you launch the system. Home Assistant is an open-source platform that's maintained by what's clearly a very committed, active community; the platform supports more than 600 components (various home automation products and services). Notably, after installing and launching Home Assistant I was able to control my Apple TV from the platform's web interface all from my phone! Some other popular components include Amazon Echo, IFTTT, Ecobee, IKEA's new home automation line, Nest, Sonos, and Plex. If you're comfortable fiddling with Raspberry Pis or digging around in Terminal, you might give Home Assistant a go — this service aims to bring together any and all of the home automation products you add to your home and it does a doggone good job at it. Learn more 2. An in-home voice assistant Siri is a fine means of controlling your smart home but nothing beats the always-on, hyper-focused devotion of an in-home voice assistant. There's something comforting about knowing you've got a means of control that doesn't need to recharge at the end of the day (or in the middle of the day if you forgot to plug in your phone the night before). These devices are tailor-made to be your virtual, voice-activated assistant and they do a damn fine job of it. I'm sure some will disagree but I hold you're not rocking a true smart home until you can reliably control it with your voice. Amazon Echo While I'm tapping away at the iOS Home app, I listen to my partner (my own personal litmus test for how normal, everyday people use technology) gleefully use Alexa to play music, control our lights and thermostat, and get the daily forecast. Amazon has stepped up in a big way when it comes to the smart home. Where Apple has chosen a rigorous, security-focused approach with HomeKit compatibility, Amazon has made Alexa integration swift and flexible. As a result, Alexa supports a whole host of smart home devices. See at Amazon If you want to learn more about the Amazon Echo or Amazon's Alexa smart assistant, you can check out all our coverage: Amazon Echo Oh! If you're not keen on giving up Siri control of your smart home devices, there's plenty of overlap between Alexa and Siri; this list has everything you need: These smart home accessories work with Amazon's Alexa and Apple's HomeKit Google Home Google Home is Google's take on the always-on, in-home smart assistant. It's tied to Google's services, of course, so if you're firmly in the Google Products camp (Gmail, Google Calendar, Android, etc.) Google Home was made for you! The beautifully designed device features some pretty powerful, nice-sounding speakers that make it a better music-listening device than the Amazon Echo, but it's still got some catching up to do in terms of smart home support. Google semi-regularly adds new smart home integrations, but its list of supported devices pales in comparison to both Apple and Amazon. That said, the device has some pretty powerful tie-ins with automation-service IFTTT; with a little fiddling you can control smart home products that you'd otherwise be unable to control. Google is skilled at taking user data and doing truly useful things with it; I expect the company will apply some of that same magic in future updates of the Google Home. See at Best Buy 3. Smart lighting I've said it before and here it is again: There's no clearer, cooler way to show off the power of smart home products than smart lighting. Every smart home owner needs to have at least a couple smart bulbs in their home, because there's no better way to sell your smart home obsession to doubters than to magically (not using a light switch) control your lights. Let the haters bask in the glory of your sunset-timed yard lights and pink-hued multicolor bulbs. Smart lights are also one of the most diverse product categories so there's plenty of room for experimentation: You can have LED strips below your cabinets, color-changing bulbs in your media room, automatic lights in your yard, dimmable recessed lighting in your ceiling — and control all of that with your voice, a mobile device, a smart switch, an automation, etc. Another reason smart bulbs make the list: Smart bulbs are among the least expensive smart home products you can buy. If you're just getting started, you can quickly build out your smart home without breaking the bank. Best Low-Cost Lights for Your Smart Home It's also worth noting smart bulbs — particularly Philips Hue bulbs — are some of the most universally compatible smart home products. When you're trying a new voice assistant, app, or service, you need something with which to test it; chances are your bulbs are going to offer more integrations than your smart lock (and that's a good thing). See at Amazon 4. A hub or HomeKit Much like the apps I mentioned before, hubs (and HomeKit) can help you tie together products from different smart-home-product manufacturers. It's a pretty crummy experience having to jump from app to app to control your smart home devices; you need an easy way to be the maestro of your smart home no matter whose brand adorns the lights, plugs, fans, and sensors in your home. HomeKit HomeKit is a framework created by Apple that lets smart-home-product manufacturers offer centralized, secure control of their devices with Siri and the home app for iOS. Apps — like the Eve app I mentioned before — can also use HomeKit to offer smart home control. While I'm a big fan of HomeKit and Apple's take on smart home control, there are still many products that aren't compatible. That's when you need a hub! Smart home hubs and HomeKit alternatives I've put together a list of the best HomeKit alternatives with compatibility information. You can learn a little bit about different smart home hubs and devices and what products they support. Best Alternatives to HomeKit Depending on the size of your smart home and the smart products you've already invested in, you might find yourself needing more than one of the alternatives I've listed — that's OK. There's no right answer (in my opinion, at least) for smart home configuration. Use the products and services that work for you in the way you want them to work. Heck, that's the whole point of having a smart home in the first place! 5. A toolbox (or a hired hand) There are plenty of smart home products that don't require complicated installation if you'd rather avoid it, but if you really want to supercharge your smart home you're going to need a little DIY magic (or a hired hand). One of my all-time favorite HomeKit-enabled smart home products is an in-wall dimming kit from Lutron. When I moved into my current home, I ran into an issue where many of the lighting fixtures featured ceiling fans with tiny candelabra bulbs, so I couldn't Philips Hue my way out of the situation. I came across the in-wall Lutron Caséta dimmers and I never looked back. I have them installed all over my house now and actually prefer them to smart bulbs. See at Amazon Installing them wasn't as easy as screwing in a bulb and flipping on a switch, though. I had to cut power at the breaker, rewire outlets, cut new holes for device boxes, troubleshoot wiring issues, etc. It was a load of fun for me, but it certainly required some research and a trip to the ol' toolbox. If you foresee yourself installing a smart thermostat, smart fans, in-wall smart lighting, a smart sprinkler system, or any other advanced-installation smart products, you're going to want to make sure you have the necessary tools on hand or call in a professional!

Editorial Director at Mobile Nations, analyst at iMore, video and podcast host, you can follow him @reneritchie on Snapchat, Instagram, and Twitter. Persisting device identification after deletion, after wiping, and hiding it from Apple — just another day in the life of Uber? Uber has been caught egregiously violating user privacy and App Store guidelines by persisting device identifications even when the Uber app was deleted and the device wiped. Mike Issac, writing for The New York Times: For months, Mr. Kalanick had pulled a fast one on Apple by directing his employees to help camouflage the ride-hailing app from Apple's engineers. The reason? So Apple would not find out that Uber had been secretly identifying and tagging iPhones even after its app had been deleted and the devices erased — a fraud detection maneuver that violated Apple's privacy guidelines. But Apple was on to the deception, and when Mr. Kalanick arrived at the midafternoon meeting sporting his favorite pair of bright red sneakers and hot-pink socks, Mr. Cook was prepared. "So, I've heard you've been breaking some of our rules," Mr. Cook said in his calm, Southern tone. Stop the trickery, Mr. Cook then demanded, or Uber's app would be kicked out of Apple's App Store. The original story used the word "tracking" which made people think Uber was persisting device location rather than device id. ID alone is still egregious though. Uber was able to do this by using private APIs, which is something expressly forbidden by Apple's terms of service. Worse, Uber deliberately tried to hide its violations by geo-fencing Apple's hometown of Cupertino, California. Unfortunately for Uber, it must have forgotten all the other Apple offices around the U.S. and the world. Something especially embarrassing for a location-based company. and there we have it! these shenanigans are likely what got Tim Cook upset with Uber (attached pics are from https://t.co/ygj739Ewvr + IDA) pic.twitter.com/BHWv6BA7PX— Will Strafach (@chronic) April 23, 2017 Uber was apparently doing it to fight abuse in China, where multiple devices were stolen, wiped, and used to fraudulently extract money from the service. Uber has every right to fight abuse but zero right to do it in a way that violates customer privacy and App Store policy. If this were a smaller, less important company, it's hard to believe Apple wouldn't have bounced their app right out of the store. The same New York Times article also alleges further privacy abuse, both on the part of Uber and of Slice Analytics. Uber devoted teams to so-called competitive intelligence, purchasing data from an analytics service called Slice Intelligence. Using an email digest service it owns named Unroll.me, Slice collected its customers' emailed Lyft receipts from their inboxes and sold the anonymized data to Uber. Uber used the data as a proxy for the health of Lyft's business. (Lyft, too, operates a competitive intelligence team.) Slice was using data from Unroll.me, a service that offered to help "clean up" inboxes in exchange for log in information that it then used to harvest user data. This is part of the reason I no longer use a personal Gmail account and don't allow any third-party service access to my work Gmail. Data is more valuable than money. If anyone is still confused by that, just look at what unscrupulous companies are willing to do to get it. I deleted the Uber app a while ago but this is enough to make me want to re-download it just so I can delete it again. (If it were safe to do so, of course.) It's not just callous, short-sighted, and unintelligent behavior on the part of Uber, it's another knife in the back of drivers, many of whom are actually liked by their customers. Just like the interface is the app to most users, the drivers are Uber to most customers, and there's not enough competition in all areas for everyone to easily switch. No idea if Uber is engaging in similar practices on Android or similarly violating the Google Play terms of service, but how much longer, and how many more abuses, must Uber rack up before serious action starts being taken?

This really has nothing to do with Google and unroll.me explicitly states what they do and how they monetize their services in their terms and conditions. They have came out and said they will clarify the messaging but it's always been there. This is Uber and Uber alone.

Just seems disingenuous to spread more fear about services that have nothing to do with this as well as continue to toss mud Googles direction. 0 15 hours ago Reply cuttheredwire With Google, you are the product, which is what he doesn't like.

Sure this will essentially happen but getting the app pulled from the App Store is more of a slow death than a bullet to the head, like this guy makes it sound. 0 15 hours ago Reply cuttheredwire A company that lost billions last year would instantly lose a lot of business. On top of that, iPhone is the premium market. I cannot say which makes more, the more common Android or the more willing to pay iOS, but neither is a small market. Add to that the increase in revenue to their competitors and the difficulty to acquire future funds to burn through… you get the idea. 0 11 hours ago Reply returnmyjedi I'm more concerned with Apple's behaviour here than Uber's, the latter being a truly despicable organisation in every aspect of their business practices. Such an egregious violation of the App Store rules should have resulted in the App being pulled (a punishment many smaller apps have been subjected to). However due to Uber's size and user base Apple aquiesced and showed that their zero tolerance policy towards privacy violations doesn't apply to everyone. 0 13 hours ago Reply DanRJones91 ^^ Bingo 0 12 hours ago Reply cuttheredwire I agree with you on principle, but users would have been ******. Lots of them who need to get to work. Warning would have needed to have been given. Uber probably had couple days to fix the issue, or else that. And that's why Cook did it in person. Otherwise the lawyers could have handled it. I still would have liked to of seen the app pulled yet left to work with a day or so notice. It still would have caused problems, but far fewer. I think they needed the slap on the wrist. Removing it forever would **** off a lot of people and make some of them switch to Android, and get tracked anyway. The market needs competition, and that would not build it. Just too many down sides, much as I hate to admit it. 0 11 hours ago Reply jsanakonda "Lots of them who need to get to work" - Really???

I love Uber and use it frequently), is that we just need to geofence all apple offices to override their rules.

By Rene Ritchie Tuesday, Apr 25, 2017 at 1:00 pm EDT 3 Comments Is Apple Watch worth it? From fitness to Apple Pay, notifications to home automation, here's what you need to know before you buy! Updated April, 2017: Pros and cons updated to reflect all the latest hardware and software features. These days, you need a computer that fits in your pocket. That's what makes iPhone so popular. You probably also still need a computer for your lap or your desk. But a computer for your wrist? That feels more like an accessory at best, and extravagance at worst. Yet Apple Watch has a few features that can make it indispensable. Whether you should get an Apple Watch or not comes down to how compelling any of the main features are for your lifestyle, either by themselves or when combined together. Those features include not only timekeeping but health and fitness tracking, notifications and communications, Apple Pay and HomeKit automation. Put simply: The Apple Watch is the shuttlecraft to the iPhone's starship. Most of what you can do on Watch you can also do on iPhone — but not as conveniently. And convenience can be a killer feature. Timekeeping It's not an uncommon story: You stopped wearing a watch because your iPhone had a big clock right on the Lock screen, only a pocket- or bag-pull away. It's the old single- vs. multi-tasker debate, and why convergent devices like the iPhone proved so popular to begin with. The Apple Watch is also a convergent device, and that convergence can be seen in every aspect, including how it tells time. When you want to see the clock on your Apple Watch, you don't have to dig into your pocket or reach for your bag. You simply turn your wrist, the screen lights up, and you can view the time and date. It can be just that simple or, in the grand tradition of timekeeping, you can add "complications". The Watch's faces range from minimal to chronometer to utilitarian to motion graphics to astronomy to, well, Mickey and Minnie Mouse. Each face also includes a number of complications which offer even more data, if you want to enable them. Complications can include features as subtle as a monogram for personalization, but also world clocks, alarms, a stopwatch, the weather, sunrise and sunset, activity levels, phases of the moon, upcoming appointments, and stock quotes. You can have complications for your apps as well, so you can see your ETA, access your voice recorder, see sports scores, measure your activity, or even tell how much distance is left before your Pokémon eggs hatch. (Seriously.) If that level of efficiency is intriguing to you, the Apple Watch might be just intriguing to you. Notifications and information You already get notifications on your iPhone. You can tell when they come in thanks to the beep, buzz, or bubble on your Lock screen. With the Apple Watch, however, those notifications can appear on your wrist, sending you a subtle tap that doesn't even light up the display unless you turn the Watch to signal your interest. Then, you only get a short summary of the information, providing the app name along with a brief bit of context. From there, you get to decide if you want to stop what you're doing and view more. There's also a Notification Center, just like on iPhone, so you can swipe down and glance at everything and anything that's come in and quickly see what's happening and what, potentially, you need to take care of. And you can do it without reaching into your pocket or bag. Facebook messages, turn-by-turn directions, airplane boarding passes, coffee cards, and other app interactions can benefit from being more easily accessible. If that appeals to you, Apple Watch might appeal to you. Health and Fitness Apple has recently re-focused Watch marketing around health and fitness and it's no mystery as to way. With a heart-rate monitor built-in, and GPS on the Series 2, Apple Watch makes for a compelling exercise and wellness companion. You automatically track all the basics, including standing and moving around as well as exercise, steps, and stairs. There's also a Workout app that's been specifically created to track your walks, runs, rides, rolls, and more. With improved water resistance and GPS on Series 2, you can even track your swims and get detailed maps of your routes on land and sea. With Activity Sharing, you share your achievements with the people closest to you. That way, when you reach a goal or they do, you can send a message or emoji to encourage them. Or to trash talk them. Whatever works for you. Strava, Nike+, RunKeeper, and most other, popular excercise apps have extensions for Apple Watch as well. So, you get to add the convenience of Apple Watch to whatever system and community you're already involved with. If any of those features could help you live a healthier, fitter life, the Apple Watch might be all the help you need. Apple Pay Apple Pay on Apple Watch is magic. Instead of having to fumble for your wallet or even your iPhone, or worry about dropping your tap-to-pay card can paying for someone else's gas or burger, you simply press a button on your Apple Watch, hold it close to the terminal, and you're done. What makes it so great is that it's always right there on your wrist, it never reveals your real credit card number or personal information, and if it loses contact with your skin (via the heart rate monitor), it shuts off so no one else can use it. In many countries, tap to pay is already ubiquitous. In the U.S., it's still rolling out. If you have a lot of tap-to-pay near you, though, Apple Watch is compelling. Connecting Apple Watch has basic phone and messaging built right in. Which makes it feel like something straight out of science fiction. It's incredibly convenient, especially if you have a bigger iPhone you typically leave on a table or in a bag. When any call or message comes in, rather than scrambling for it, you can simply glance at your wrist. For short conversations or replies, you can talk or text right from your watch. For longer communications, you can start on your watch and smoothly transition to your phone, or you can just go get your phone once you see who's calling and messaging on your wrist. You can even dictate or hand write short messages on Apple Watch, which makes it remarkably effective for quickly communicating on the go. If keeping in touch matters to you, the Apple Watch just might be the right touch for your wrist. Remote control The Apple Watch will let you control your Apple TV. It'll also let you remotely access your iPhone's camera, and thanks to Siri and HomeKit integration, it can even control the lights, thermometer, blinds, fans, and other connected devices in your home. The possibilities for the Apple Watch are boundless. Not only does it mean never having to get up to turn off your lights, it means not even having to reach for your phone. You can adjust anything in your setup, right from your wrist. Who shouldn't get an Apple Watch If you don't like watches or already have a traditional watch you'd never want to take off, if you're fine reaching for your iPhone or don't have an iPhone at all, or if you simply want to wait for a future generation to see where wrist computing goes, you probably don't want or need an Apple Watch. Who should get an Apple watch If you want to spend less time on your iPhone and more time out and about, if the idea of super-convenient tap-to-pay and fitness tracking appeals to you, if you want to be able to glance at a call or message before deciding whether to reach for your phone, or you simply want to experiment with the future right now, today, you probably want to try out an Apple Watch. Still undecided about Apple Watch? If you're still not sure about whether you should get an Apple Watch or not, check out our Apple Watch Forums for expert help and discussion. Also remember: You can go into an Apple Store, if you have one nearby, and try Apple Watch out. You can even buy it, use it in your daily life for a week or so, keep it if you love it, and return it if you don't. Either way, let me know what you decide in the comments below!

Being able to see notifications and information on your wrist sounds like a gimmick when you can just pull out your phone, but the incredible amount of convenience that brings really makes a difference. One thing I really like as well is that the taptic feedback when you get a notification is really easy to feel, whereas I can often miss notifications when my phone is on silent and just vibrates in my pocket. The device takes a small bit of learning to control properly at first but you very quickly get the hang of it. The only downside I have with it is that I wish it had an always-on display instead of having to lift your wrist, especially considering that it doesn't always work (albeit it does work 90% of the time) 0 8 hours ago Reply cardfan Pretty much what he said. Some notifications I need immediately and I usually always get that with the watch. That alone has paid for itself multiple times. I'd like an always on display as well. Airpods really turn this into the ipod on the wrist we always wanted. Also wouldn't mind having a watch that was just communication, music, cellular, facetime, better speaker...those things vs the health stuff I don't really use. I get plenty of exercise and what not, but I just have no interest in using the watch for it. I'm still not sure I like watchOS 3 over the previous version. Hopefully Apple continues to tweak it. 0 5 hours ago Reply waynezhang In my eyes, the answer is simple: If you have enough budget, Then get one.

Sling TV — Everything you need to know! By Luke Filipowicz Monday, Apr 24, 2017 at 5:08 pm EDT 2 Comments What to know if Sling TV is right for you? Here are all the FAQs with answers! Sling TV is a TV streaming service that you can access on Apple TV, iPhone, iPad, Android tablets, and plenty of other devices. If you're looking to join the growing number of people cutting the cord to the big mean cable companies, Sling TV is a pretty reasonably priced option to help reduce your entertainment bill. You probably have some questions about how Sling TV works, and we've got the answers! What's new with Sling TV? If you use Sling TV on your Apple TV, we have good news for you! Sling TV will be introducing its cloud DVR feature to the tvOS app. According to the Sling TV announcement you can purchase 50 hours of DVR storage for just an extra $5 per month on top your monthly subscription rate. Sling TV outlined and described the new features in its announcement this morning. " Watch anytime, anywhere– Record your favorite programs and watch whenever you want across all Amazon Fire TVs and Fire tablets, Android mobile devices, Android TVs, Apple TVs, Roku streaming players and Roku TVs. AirTV Player is not currently compatible with Cloud DVR. Conflict-free recording– Record multiple programs simultaneously, and forget about recording conflicts. Keep recordings as long as you want– With Sling TV, your recordings won't expire as long as you remain a Sling TV subscriber with Cloud DVR. Auto-managed recordings– Sling TV will make room for new recordings by deleting your old recordings as you reach capacity, starting with your oldest 'watched' recording, so you can binge on your new favorite show." What is Sling TV? Sling TV is what we call an "over-the-top" — OTT for short — service. In layman's terms that means it's an internet-based service, so you won't have a dedicated cable box or a line coming in from a cable company. Sling TV, much like its name implies, is a way to stream live TV content, meaning it shows TV programs as they are broadcast and typically not on demand like other popular services such as Netflix or Hulu; however, there are some channels that do offer content on demand — like Syfy — and certain content providers offer Sling TV as a sign-on option. How does it work? When you download the Sling TV app on your Apple TV, iPhone, and iPad, you'll need to sign up for a subscription. The subscriptions are month-to-month and vary in cost depending on which channel package you choose. How much does it cost? They are three base subscription packages. Sling Orange, Sling Blue, and Sling Orange + Blue, the base prices for each package are $20, $25, and $40 respectively. Which channels are included? The Sling Orange subscription comes with the 30 channels listed in the screenshot below. The Sling Blue subscription comes with the 40 channels listed in the screenshot below. The Sling Orange + Blue subscription comes with 50 channels listed in the screenshot below. Are those the only channels available? No. There are plenty of small channel bundles you can add-on to any subscription for an extra fee — typically $5 or $10 a month — and you can also pay extra for premium channels like HBO and Showtime. A few examples of the add-on packages you can purchase are in the screenshots down below. A full list can be found on the Sling TV website. < Will there be commercials Yes. Just like regular cable, there will be commercials, and you'll only be able to skip them if you have recorded the program on the cloud DVR. Can I get Sling TV in my country? Unfortunately, right now Sling TV is only available to residents of the United States. How fast should my internet be to use Sling TV? Sling recommends download speeds of 25/mbps to achieve the highest video quality using Sling TV. Can I cancel my subscription at any time? Yes. There is no contract to use Sling TV, as it's a month-to-month service. If you choose to cancel your account, the billing will cease immediately. Is there a free trial? Yes. Sling TV offers a 7-day free trial, meaning you can cancel your subscription anytime during those seven days and not be charged with anything. Are there any deals? Sling TV does offer a few fantastic deals to help get you started! Right now, there are two: Get a free Roku Express when you prepay two months of Sling TV. Get 50% off the Roku Premiere+ when you prepay three months of Sling TV. How to I sign up? Head over to the Sling TV website and follow its easy sign-up process!

With the AirPort Utility! Need to setup a secure no-nonsense Wi-Fi Access point? Apple has you covered. Depending on your level of computer Gung-Fu, setting up a Wi-Fi access point with proper security might seem a little intimidating. Thankfully, Apple's Airport Base Stations can take some of the edge of, thanks to the built-in AirPort Utility. How to set up your AirPort router Plug your Airport Base Station into a power outlet. Connect the modem provided by your Internet Service Provider (ISP) to your AirPort Extreme using an Ethernet cable. Use the- wire to the bottom-most port on the back of the AirPort Base Station. (Don't worry if you make a mistake. You'll be prompted to fix things, if needed, during set up). Launch AirPort Utility on your Mac. Click on Other WiFi Devices in the upper right corner. Click Other Options to setup the AirPort for additional capabilities. Select Create a new network Click Next. Enter a Network Name and a Base Station Name. (You can leave them as is or change them to whatever you prefer.) Enter your preferred Password. You can choose to have one password for both your Wi-Fi network and to configure the AirPort itself by checking Use a single password. (I recommend you have separate passwords for added security.) If you purchased a Base Station with an internal hard drive — i.e., a Time Capsule — you can also choose a separate password for that by checking "Secure disk with separate password". Click Next. If your Airport has the option for Enabling a Guest Network you can enable that option here (see below, start at step 5) Click Next. Click Done. How to create a guest network on your AirPort Base Station If you have frequent visitors and don't fancy the idea of giving them your AirPort password, you can create a Guest Network for them to connect you. This gives your friends, family, and associates a working Wi-Fi connection but also gives you some security. Launch AirPort Utility on your Mac. Click on your Base Station at the bottom. Click on Edit. Click on the **Wireless* tab at the top. Check Enable Guest Network. Enter a new Network Name. The guest network name should be something easy to discern from your regular "secured" network. Select your desired level of Guest Network Security. Choose None if you want it completely open, WPA2 if you want it secure. If you have decided to have WPA2 Personal as your security level, enter your Guest Network Password and verify it. Click Update Restart your Base Station. If you wish to protect your network from general access WPA2 Personal offers a good level of encrypted connectivity. You may want to provide an open access point if you want people to connect to your network without a password. You can select None to do just that. You should avoid WPA as that encryption level is easily compromised. Any questions setting up your AirPort Base Station? Your AirPort Base Station will reboot and you can then start connecting your various Wi-Fi capable devices to your new access point. Depending on your requirements, you may be satisfied with the network coverage your single Airport provides you. However, if you require better coverage or own a multi-storey dwelling, you may need to extend your network by installing additional access points in a configuration called bridged mode. Stay tuned for our article on how to do just that. If you have any comments or questions about setting up your AirPort Base Station leave them in the comments below!

On 21 April, Australian Federal Court Justice Moshinsky ruled that the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) should be able to serve court documents on Apple US in the United States over allegations the company engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct in Australia. The move comes just weeks after the ACCC revealed it had commenced legal proceedings against the California-based tech giant and its local subsidiary, with the industry watchdog seeking pecuniary penalties, injunctions, declarations, compliance program orders, corrective notices, and costs against Apple. Proceeding were subsequently brought against Apple Pty Ltd, the company’s Australian corporate entity, as well as Apple Inc (Apple US), its US-based parent company. However, while the ACCC has served the originating application and its statement on Apple Australia locally, according to Federal Court documents, Apple US has not provided an address for service in Australia, even though court documents have been provided to a senior lawyer at Apple US. Consequently, the ACCC sought leave to serve the court documents out of its jurisdiction in Australia, on Apple US in its home country. In a decision dated 21 April, Moshinsky ruled that it is appropriate to give the ACCC leave to serve the court documents on Apple Inc in the US, out of jurisdiction. “It is proposed to serve the court documents in the USA,” Moshinsky stated. “The proposed method of service is to use a private service agent retained through a firm of lawyers based in San Francisco. According to Moshinksy, the ACCC has a “prima facie” case for the relief claimed against Apple US in the proceeding. “There are two aspects to the case brought by the ACCC against Apple US,” Moshinsky said. “The first aspect concerns an alleged false or misleading representation by Apple US on the Apple website. “The second aspect of the ACCC’s case against Apple US is as follows. It is alleged that Apple US is liable for certain conduct of Apple Australia on the basis that Apple Australia engaged in the relevant conduct both on its own behalf and on behalf of Apple US. “In my view, it is appropriate in the circumstances to make such an order…the allegations against the respondents are closely intertwined. It is desirable that the claims against both respondents proceed together in the one proceeding,” he said. The substance of the ACCC’s claims against Apple Australia and Apple US revolve around claims the companies made in relation to a fault, known as “error 53”, experienced by some iPhone and iPad users from September 2014 to at least February 2016, which rendered their devices inoperable. The error 53 software fault occurred when those iPhone or iPad users attempted to update the iOS software on their device by connecting their device to Apple iTunes through a personal computer, according to the ACCC’s application. “Apple US represented that iOS8 and iOS9 would improve the functionality and performance of iPhones and iPads,” the ACCC’s concise statement supporting its application said. “When the iPhone or iPad users downloaded, and attempted to install, iOS8 or iOS9 on their device by connecting it to Apple iTunes through a personal computer, an error message appeared on Apple iTunes stating that the device could not be restored, and the device had stopped functioning. “This occurrence was commonly referred to as ‘bricking’,” it said.

On 18 April, the court ruled that a woman who had a purchased an iPad Air 2 in 2015 and returned the device to Apple due to problems with its Wi-Fi connectivity was entitled to a new device. Apple had attempted to give the woman a refurbished iPad, as the company allows for in the terms of service of its Apple Care programs, but the woman refused to accept it. “A replacement iPad is, despite everything that Apple has argued about it, not a new iPad, but a replacement,” the judge wrote. “Apple is not selling ‘replacements’ as new in the market.” Apple sells refurbished devices through its authorised partners such as mobile phone carriers. Apple did not immediately return a request for comment on the ruling. A civil lawsuit has been filed on similar grounds in federal court in California. The case is set for trial in December 2018.

Read our iPhone 7 review to learn what sets this phone apart from the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. You can buy the iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus at a discount with the best iPhone 7 Black Friday deals. Read: Siri Tips & Tricks Even if you think you know which phone is best, you might be surprised to learn about all the reasons the iPhone is better than Android. iPhone Apps Are First and Better Looking Most of the popular apps are on both platforms, but many top games and apps still come to iPhone first. We’re seeing more apps come to both Android and iPhone at the same time, but there are still way more iPhone only apps that we see than Android only. When apps are available on iPhone and Android we still often see a better design on the iPhone version than on Android. This is something that still rings true in 2017. For example, we still see some new Snapchat features and Spotify features come to iPhone before Android. iPhone owners are enjoying Super Mario Run, but the Super Mario Run Android app is still on the way. Read: Best iPhone Apps Apps are an area where the gap is closing, but the differences still exist and are noticeable. We also see Apple take better care of the App Store. Recently they purged 47,300 apps from the app store that were simply bad or abandoned. Fast iPhone Updates for All iPhone owners enjoy quick and regular iOS updates for the iPhone no matter what carrier they use. Faster updates are available for all iPhone owners. Android updates take months to arrive on all the devices. After an Android device is 18 months old, you may need to wait for a new Android smartphone to get the latest software. Apple delivers iPhone updates to devices that are three years old. Apple offers iPhone 4s iOS 9 support. It is unheard of to see support for an Android phone that old. iOS 10 is available for the iPhone 5. When you look at Android devices support ends much faster. Google promises at least two years for Nexus devices, which means Nexus 6 support ends this fall and the Nexus 6P in September 2017. Google may push farther out, but it is not a guarantee. Other Android device manufacturers don’t typically match the longevity of iOS updates. On top of the added update support, Apple does not allow carriers to hold up the updates. As soon as the update is available from Apple it is available on every carrier. If you really want Android Nougat, you may need to simply buy a new Android phone. Works Great with All Your Devices If you own an iPhone, iPad and Mac your information flows smoothly from one device to the other. You can quickly sync photos to all of your devices, answer a phone call on your iPad or Mac and send text messages from your other devices. There is also support for Handoff that allows you to start a task on your iPhone and continue on your iPad or Mac. The iPhone works great with the iPad and Mac. Overall the connectivity between these devices is something Android doesn’t yet match without relying on a collection of third-party applications and services to hodgepodge together a similar feature. Sharing a file from your iPhone to your Mac is also faster and easier thanks to AirDrop. This built-in service sends the file wirelessly directly to the Mac, even when there is no other WiFi around.

You simply can’t go wrong. I own an iPhone 5, iPad Mini 3, MacBook Pro, iMac, and Apple TV. I would not even consider anything else, especially something from that “G…” company which I abhor. I won’t even use their search engine. Same goes for anything from that software manufacturer that, well, just call it “MS). Try calling any other manufacturer for support and see if you can understand what they are saying. I suppose I am bias toward Apple but after nearly 30 years of dealing with computers of all sorts I guess my opinion is warranted. 07/17/2015 gabe Reply why people like iphones? I never understood why anyone would like to give control to another company of what you do with their device. why force u to follow MEDIA SHARING and digital rights media? you cannot torrent on iPhone, nor transfer music and videos without ITunes or a paid online service in iOS. I hate that Samsung s6 tried copying apple iPhone. no microsd slot and integrated battery.

I’m just the O’Hare delivery guy. But it seems like trees might be worth a try, so I say let it grow. 04/19/2017 joshua millsap Reply They don’t allow you to do things like torrenting and music sharing because its against the law. why on earth would you want to steal? Also SD cards are historical flawed systems of storage for phones. 03/04/2017 Evie Reply It is simply the portability. I have watch ,I go to the gym. I have apple computer and I can receive my phone calls there and iMessages. It crashes less often than microsoft does. I can contact apple support, whenever I want. The other time ,the bluetooth in my iPhone did not work, I contacted tech support midnight and they were available. We could not fix the problem. They called me the next day and told me to go to the nearest store and pick up a brand new phone. One more thing, my iPhone was out of warranty for 165 days. They told me they cared about customer satisfaction. When I called microsoft in order to talk to me they wanted $250. Now, compare 12/02/2015 Zombieknight Productions Reply You’re literally so idiotic that you can’t spell the full name of a company. Only Apple, cuz you’re an I sheep. You can go very wrong. If people were smart these days, they would understand that iPhones are unequivocally not the right choice for them. You wouldn’t recommend anything else, because it is too limited and unintelligent to use anything else. Stop trying to influence other people to buy garbage phones and devices 05/12/2016 Nancy Reply Why are u being a hypocrite calling someone idiotic for not knowing how to spell the company name right when some of ur sentences don’t even make sense. Apple doesn’t have any competition be used it is the best phone to get. 07/13/2016 Rona Reply First of all, don’t criticize someone for calling someone else idiotic when you can’t even use proper spelling or grammar. Second, Apple is all marketing. There is nothing special about it. Android offers phones that have expandable memory (and guess who doesn’t?) and better high-speed data services. iPhones die extremely quickly, you can’t use iTunes on any other devices, whereas Android platforms are available on all devices, the picture quality on an iPhone is pathetic compared to Androids, and Apple products are majorly behind in technology. The latest update for an iPhone came out two years ago for an Android. Apple has a set array of things it can do, and you can’t customize or change that. But if you want a high-end technology phone, choose an Android. It does so much more and you can customize and change its features. I have had both an iPhone and an Android phone. 09/14/2016 Abhishek well,mam i am an android user and i would like to say that iphones are the best because when you buy an android first it will give you good performance but after one month it will start hanging and work slow and that is same with every android devices.and their are so many android malware which also affect performance. Iphones are the best, secure and stable. 09/15/2016 Me Stay butthurt, loser ; ) 12/04/2016 jgames “nothing special about it” fastest phone ever 3d touch very good camera looks very nice “nothing special about it” why do we need expandable memory on iOS? gime a few reasons for that. “better high-speed data” give me your source for all this information. iphones die extremely quickly? how? do you even have an iphone? iphones have much better standby and screen on time with heavy usage than android. you cant use itunes on other devices, yes, but ios wants to keep it ios exclusive because their services are one of the major selling points for them. android platforms are available everywhere, but google software is usually preferred to ios software. pathetic picture quality? wut? iphone pictures wont lose quality when you zoom in and support much more colors than any old android camera. android cameras are very nice as well, though. “apple are behind in technology” a lot of people say this but it’s actually quite the opposite. 3d touch was very innovative, its like a ‘right click’ for your phone. the latest iphone update did not come out 2 years ago. you seem like you have no idea what you’re talking about and just spouting nonsense. apple can do a lot of things without customization, but what customization do we really need? people always saying android is more customizable but never give examples, and when they do its “homescreen.” moving home screen icons around is a pretty useless feature tbh android isnt more high end tech than iphone and i dont see how much more it does. you havent even explained how it can in your comment. so please use common sense before spouting nonsense 02/27/2017 Gage iPhones are by far the better phone. I’ve had android phones for most of my life but i bought an iPhone 6 about a year ago and now I have the 7 and I can’t imagine going back. Android is slow, every button you push there’s a lag before it actually opens the app or whatever you pushed. Also, every android I’ve ever had has had terrible battery life, it never lasts the full day but my iPhone almost always does. And my last point, android automatically installs like 10-20 on your phone that you cannot delete no matter how hard you try. Apple has 3-5. Yes, android has a port for SD cards, but what good is that if a large amount of your memory is made up of apps you don’t want. You’re entitled to your opinion but I advise that you get yourself an iPhone 7 and keep an open mind. I’m fairly certain you realize how much better it is 05/23/2016 Anthony Reply Not very nice. Also, Apple is just as good as Android, theres aspects that one company has over the other, and vice versa, so the best thing to do is just to test out both and find your favorite and use it because Android and Apple’s problems and advantages weigh out each other so it really just matters which one you like the most so just use the one u like and stop arguing. 08/19/2016 Zane Reis Reply I prefer Android because of the coustomization it has to offer. I prefer to be able to change change almost every aspect about my phone and making it the way “I” like it, not the way Apple likes it. I like the coustomization while others find it chaotic, confusing, and would rather it be (in their eyes) simpler. 05/26/2016 Billy Reply Says the one who has Zombie Knight as their username. 07/18/2016 Nate Pauley Reply That’s an interesting rather stupid mindset to have and it makes me reflect on the time I had those same views. It took me 6 years as an android user to eventually realise how inferior it is to iOS. Android is plagued with fragmentation, so much that not even customisation can save it. There should be a term that describes blindsided android followers, if there is one then I’d like to know it. iOS is solid, stable, secure and much more better looking than android – Apple pays exquisite attention to the finer details and they will continuously improve on the irritating nooks and crannies so many people mention in the comments. The best part is APPLE USERS CAN ACTUALLY BE A PART of the firmware updates and have assurance in a better OS experience overtime. I’ve had my S6 for a year and I’ve only managed to have one firmware update that took 7 months to deliver. I can only give credit to android for the premium android devices such as my S6, until then the physicality of a device alone cannot make me shift in the near future. I want a solid experience, not a hollow one. 08/02/2016 Adarsh Reply Hi, Your comparison of iphone with S7 is not right because in case of iphone both hardware and software are developed by Apple and in case of S7 developer of hardware is Samsung and developer of software is Google. I use Nexus 5 phone, hardware and software both developed by Google and manufactured by LG and ipad Air2 by Apple. Both devices update periodically whenever updates are released and I am happy with both. 09/15/2016 Me Reply LOL stay laughably buthurt/beyond tasteless loser Fandroid X ) 03/02/2017 xxLoser123xx Reply Wow you know how to use a Thesaurus. 03/06/2017 Sally Fallis Reply Wow! I AM impressed! You know about the Thesaurus!! I didn’t think anyone under 50 ever heard of it anymore! 12/17/2015 Noah Reply This comment, as well as this article are laughable at best. Coming from a person who owns all major Apple products but frequently bounces back and forth in the smartphone department, I don’t see how any of these actually make the iPhone “better” than android. I would say the only point that is valid is the support Apple has from app developers. It’s pretty easy to see that apps on the iPhone can be “prettier” than apps on android with the extra animations, and quick gestures. However even that is relative, since iOS gives you security and “pretty animations” but gives of freedom and functionality in the process. I still can’t tell you which phone is better, as that all is personal preference and I really don’t care which phone is “better”. I just want a phone that does what I want it to do without too many hiccups (which is why I’ll never buy another Samsung device). For now, I’d say in terms of productivity, the iPhone is great if you are a person who needs iMessage, FaceTime, and the Apple ecosystem to feel comfortable doing work. While I believe most android phones will get work DONE. With the amount of third party apps available to you on the play store, multi window, Google now on tap, and other gestures. I have always felt an android is phone is more a workhorse while the iPhone is king of simplicity. 05/23/2016 Anthony Reply Congrats, you just wasted about 5-15 minutes of your time typing out this article because its not going to convince anyone. Just stick to the one you like best and live life. 05/25/2016 Blake Kersey Reply And what makes you think he gives a f$&# what you think?? 05/30/2016 hello Reply Unless you’re a billionaire you cannot stick to the pone that you wanto 07/30/2016 Avalanche Tsunami Reply Dude, he also has a “Android vs iPhone: 15 Reasons Android is Better” article too. So, he’s not being biased. http://www.gottabemobile.com/2016/05/26/android-vs-iphone-2016-android-better/ 11/10/2016 Pixleboy2 Just because he has another article doesn’t mean this one’s biased 01/30/2017 Selenia Thank you for that. This article and many commenters made me want to vomit thinking he was so biased and the sheep just followed along. I can give numerous reasons Android is a better OS, but that is not the point. However, some Android devices suck. Most of the detractors comments are true of stock Samsung devices. Samsung may be the most popular, but far from the best. They make pretty good hardware, but the software begs for rooting and custom ROMS. I am typing from a Nexus 6P, which is pure Android. Google does good with monthly updates, too. But I am using Pure Nexus, the best reason for owning a Nexus/Pixel device, with ElementalX kernel for out of this world stability, smoothness, flexibility, and battery life. Unless I use hotspot(tunneled over VPN), I only have to charge every 2 days under pretty heavy use. PN is actually updated more than Google’s stock and usually delivers security updates within a day of release, which is faster than Google often rolls it out to most users. 01/06/2016 Leo Keys Reply Why would someone else go with a product by Google, NVidia (I will come back to them), or Microsoft; over that “A…” Company (Repeat)? The reason people would use nVidia over the AMD (god I hate AMD’s Products) GPU’s found in Mac products? They want a more powerful GPU. Apple says that their “PC’s” are better and use top-notch products. Why don’t they use the GeForce GTX 980m in the MacBook Pro? Why don’t they use Quadro cards over FirePro cards? Because Apple doesn’t know anything about Graphics. As for iMac’s I have no clue why some use an i5. Apple products thermal throttle a lot. Android is secure with the right Antivirus programs. It is also much more free to do what ever you want. But, because your an iSheep, you can’t process facts that favor the other side of the grass. Guess your life must be happy, getting råpēd by Apple, every year and paying thousands on eye candy. Why use Google or Bing over Yahoo? Yahoo sucks, that’s why. Face the fact that Yahoo and other search engines are inferior to Google. Apple products are trash and are eye candy for white girls (Starbucks and that stuff). 01/06/2016 Pedro Coimbra Reply Now you have to bring the Nvidia/ATI war? What, the iphone/android isn’t enough for you? Dude AMD cards are equally powerful, no matter how much you “hate them”. Why Apple chose AMD? Maybe prices, power consumption, price/performance ratio, easier to adapt to their hardware, who knows? But a company such as Apple (you can write the complete name, it won’t bite you) so adept at optimization doesn’t make these decisions lightly, they HAVE a reason, one that you *don’t know*, but that’s irrelevant. About the i5, a reason for the apparent lower specs must be because of how streamlined and optimized the OS is, instead of being made to work with zillions of combinations of brands, boards, peripherals. So what you want in hardware to cope with the software, was made achieved with the fat-free software. «Android is secure with the right Antivirus programs», well I guess any system is secure with the right Antivirus programs, isn’t it? but never 100%. How about a system that doesn’t need antivirus, just a little inteligence from it’s user? Android safe… yes, keep dreaming, it’s not as the net isn’t filled with cases of security holes and breaches of android. If you reply to my I advise you right now to not bringing ATI/Nvidia stupid nerdish arguments or sheep mentality, about mobile platforms and geekinesses like that, because I simply don’t have the patience. P.s: «Apple products are trash and are eye candy for white girls» …. LOL… I’m trying to contain myself here… :D 04/21/2016 Vickie Reply I love you 🙌🏼 (apparently I am a white girl who loves Apple and Starbucks… I’m more of a Costa girl myself) 05/23/2016 Anthony Reply Its based on opinion, Apple and Android are like XBox and PS4, they have advantages over each other and problems of their own, nothing is gained over arguing about it because recently Android has caught up to Apple so now its just up to personal preference because they are pretty much at the same level right now. 07/15/2016 quenchybro Reply why does everyone write a full on report about their opinion this is ridiculous 01/23/2016 Maestro Reply hhhh your gr8 especially last sentence 01/23/2016 Maestro Reply Last sentence especially Starbucks hhhhhhhh made me die of laugh 09/13/2016 bestdeals242 Reply Nice 03/21/2016 Matt Reply what search engine do you use Bing lol or internet explorer 05/23/2016 Anthony Reply Who the F-Word uses Internet Explorer anymore 05/03/2016 Thomas Oglesby Reply Are you ok?

Very sad….. 10/06/2016 Alon Reply Amazing, almost all whats written in the article is wrong. More apps with faster updates??? How can it be if 85 percent of the market is Android, and it much more easier to write an app to Android? It’s not making any sense and wrong. Also other things like sharing things and integration compared to Apple products only. Almost every line in this article is not right. 12/12/2016 Cjros Reply LOL, thank you for making me 100℅ sure that Android is way better than newest IOS. Your arguments are so poor and naive :). The only thing youve got right is the SD expansion, but it is not any issue at all :). Thank you, my hero :) 12/15/2016 Debapriyo Reply You are so dangerously biased towards Apple that some of your words make so sense and are outright stupid. I have no problems with you choosing an apple product but lol. You don’t use Google search engine? Then you are missing out. Their search engine is still the best and most reliable and miles ahead of other search engine options. Google Maps way better than Apple Maps. Every tiny feature Apple introduces in the new version of IOS, Google had it in android 2 years back. I myself love some Apple products and appreciate the high standards of quality they incorporate in their products but please don’t even compare Apple with Google. Apple just makes iphones, macbook and some fancy toys. Google makes much much more and is the spearhead of IT innovation today. Be a fanboy but don’t be an idiot. 03/22/2017 ComputerGeek Reply you’re weird 06/23/2015 Chris H Reply Some of these reasons for being better than Android phones are oxymoronic. An extended warranty and readily available Apple Stores suggest that the iPhone is prone to bugs and damage. I will stick with my G3 because I know if I drop it it won’t shatter and I won’t have to give more money to Apple either for a case and/or a screen fix. There is a reason there aren’t Android stores out there. Because their phones don’t nearly have as many issues in my opinion. Consider Chevrolet and Honda. The Honda will last and is just as nice if not nicer than the Chevy, which will not last nearly as long and will force loyal customers to buy yet another Chevy. 07/27/2016 eiendiaies your_ufo Reply I would love to hear your comment now about your G3. Android stores are not because android companies dont give a f.ck about costumers, they just improve SPECS SPECS AND SPECS but where is NO improving quality. Why for example iphone 12 megapixel camera can beat sony xperia 23 megapixel camera, why iphone 1500 mah battery last longer than lg 3000mah, why fingerprint on iphone works much better than samsungs? And whats a practical difference between 640p vs 2k smartphone screen? Damn the real sheeps dont understand what apple cares about costumers and they stay at same screen resolutions because they just dont need to improve screens, android companies just keep adding numbers on specs. But where is quality improvment? You say iphone works better because of lower resolution screens, but than why androids keep improving resolutions but forget about older android users? I am ex samsung and LG user, rubbish costumer services, if android die than i must wait couple weeks for replacment, if somethin happen with iphone i know where is apple store and dealing with them in same day. Price stays high for iphone for a real reason. Iphone is not about SPECS, its about quality in every aspect. 09/30/2016 Linked Devices Reply The issue with iPhones that I hated was that the only way you could fix any glitch that would inevitably crop up is by factory resetting the phone each and every time. It’s such an annoying and time consuming process having to set everything back up again. When I made the switch to Android I was really impressed by how stable and self contained it was. Whenever there was a glitch it was limited to that particular app and you could simply reinstall it and it’d be fixed. I’ve never encountered any systemwide issues such as the iPhone misc storage bug that would happen to me all the time with the 6s. Apple does a great job hiding all of its glitches by simply not providing any prompts. Apps just disappear when they crash. It’s terrible. I know a lot of people with the misc storage bug to this day and don’t know it. They just think they’re out of space all the time because they need a new phone.. 09/30/2016 Linked Devices Reply I lol’d at how much superior the author thought the lightning cable was because it was reversible. You have a fifty fifty chance at it if you do it blindly but most cables have a dimple on top to make sure you get it even time. It’s the most versatile cable, it’s simple, affordable and it just works. No one really has a hard time plugging them in, that was an invented problem. 06/25/2015 RuskieBear Reply 90% of these are false 09/30/2015 poopy Reply You’re just a piece of poop 09/14/2016 Trashpple Reply Chill out iRetard. 10/28/2015 jihou Reply your moms false 06/30/2015 phinfankid Reply I’m a long time android user, but I thought about switching to iPhone on my last upgrade. Some of these were acceptable reasons, but most were not. My wife is using an iPhone 6, and I have the Galaxy S6 edge. We both agree that my phone is far superior in terms of speed and screen resolution, but her camera, even being spec-deficient to my Android, seems as good as, or even better somehow. I like your point on the updates all rolling out at once, but almost every other “point” you made about iPhone being better boils down to one thing: lots of your friends have iPhones. That’s it. That’s the selling point, and the basis of this article. “iPhone apps look better.” – That’s completely relative. Lots of apps do look better, but they generally are paid apps that are free in the Play Store. “Works for all your devices” – So what? I thought this was a phone article. Android works with all your crap too. “No Carrier bundled apps” – I dont know how that’s a selling point, but okay, you win. Bloatware is an issue on android. “Sharing to other iPhones”/”Better resell” – Your friends all have them, so you should too. Then you can sell them to other friends who have older ones and make more money. Ridiculous. Yeah, you get a few more bucks for them, so that means you should have an inferior phone? Who buys a phone because of resale value? Preposterous. “Lightning cable is miles better” – My S6 charges from nothing to 40% in 10 minutes. iPhone can’t do that. I understand that the cable may be good, but “miles better” is a stretch. “Apple Stores” – So? I don’t even understand how this is a point in your article. Go to best buy, it’s the same crap. “Touch ID”/”Headphone controls” – Those both work flawlessly on a good number of high end android devices as well. “iMessage, Facetime, blah blah” / “Share apps easily” – All your friends have these, so you should too, or they’ll laugh at you. “Siri works better than Google Now” – Google Now isn’t Siri. That shouldn’t be a comparison. It’s not trying to be Siri. It’s a voice search, and that’s it. Siri works, but it doesnt work “better” than anything else, because there’s nothing to compare it to. If you like having Siri, good. “Notifications are better” – No, they’re not. Android’s notifications work exactly the same. Now don’t get me wrong, I’m not saying iPhone isn’t better, I’m just saying you haven’t proven that it is here in the slightest. Both OS’s are very well made, and the playing field is far more level than any avid IOS or Android user wants to admit. 07/30/2015 Helene Reply Excellent comment. I totally agree with you. 08/07/2015 Sam Reply DONT throw away your s6 edge… get an iphone but if you can use them interchangeably 07/15/2016 quenchybro Reply lol hi sam 10/09/2015 Palbo Reply I disagree. Bloatware is not really a problem on Android; any respectable company will only install commonly used and necessary apps like the Play Store and Gmail. If you are buying a phone that will leave your wallet intact (and still deliver better specs in every single measurable way than an iPhone 6, such as the lenovo k3 note) from a less known company which may allow bloatware, you can easily root the phone and uninstall it. I do agree with your other points, though! 05/27/2016 ZENCKPRI Reply Phinfankid you are completely right. I agree with everything you said. You are probably the only logical person who has commented so far. Also the iPhones storage is just a scam to keep people paying and buying more storage. Unfortunately the Samsung Galaxy s6 also removed the microsd slot, but luckily Samsung got it sh*t together with the Samsung s7, which in my opinion is the best phone. 07/12/2016 10beasts Reply You really explained the situation very well! Loved it. 07/09/2015 D Reply This article compares Apples to apples. Your references to Android are focused towards Samsung (you know the company that makes the screen, processor, RAM, and ROM in most Apple devices). Compared to a more vanilla Android experience, Apple blows. My $200 Zenfone 2 is better than any fruity phone at a third of the cost. With Apple, you pay more for less, but get a pointless logo. 07/10/2015 Scott Reply What about Apples different charger cords? Droids micro USB cords work with any other Android device. In fact, pretty much all phones but apple use it. They want you to need to buy new chargers more often. Apples are streamlined fads also, just like every product they’ve ever released. Yeah, cause being “cool” means getting the same more expensive products all the other rich kids got. 07/30/2015 Helene Reply I had both and I don’t agree with this article. I prefer Android phones over Iphones. I think Apple have better computers, but not better cell phones. 03/06/2016 Firas Bajjar Reply Keep dreaming…. 03/06/2016 Firas Reply Keep dreaming….Apple has better computers you serious? You can do a lot of stuff on Windows pcs while Mac struggles to do one stuff….At least it’s stable and easy to use through…But seriously it’s overpriced shit…You can get almost awesome gaming laptops for the price of a MacBook Air. In fact, iPhone is better than android….Because the mobile era is another thing, it’s called mobile for a reason. It should be easy to use and quick. That’s why Apple wins at this point…Come on get real men you wanna play GTA V on your mobile? No for sure. Apps are even better (which surprises me why it isn’t the same for a Mac vs Windows) iPhone’s are faster than most android phones….But if you compare it to stock original android phones, the iPhone still beats them but not as much as other android phones. Because unfourtantely Google didn’t know how to configure Linux properly but i bet you if it does…The iOS faster than android is a history….Linux is ultra-powerful and that’s why most of the world super computers use it…Because you can tweak it the way you like and you will get an extremely faster performance than Windows and Mac. But Google couldn’t handle it I guess….Even the Java language is much faster in terms of processing but I’m still surpsised why iOS apps are still faster….It’s just another replica of Nokia’s fault with Symbian (Nokia never built a stable Eco system for it until it’s near to death period, which led the CEO to get rid of Symbian because it takes years to built an eco system) 05/19/2016 PABLO Reply Right off the bat i can tell you are a little kid who just bought a samsung and is butt hurt you made the wrong choice, “struggles to do one stuff” he also pays great attention in class shown by how grammatically correct this is (as i was writing this I found this… “The iOS faster than android is a history” WHO TEACHES THIS KID I NEED TO COMPLAIN)! 08/04/2015 Robin Reply Poorly written article bringing in irrelevant points and downright false information. Take your “works great with all your devices” section for an example. I use an android phone and an apple computer, and the two devices are 100% compatible with no need for a “third-party application” or service. Completely untrue information in this section. Also I have texts and all the regular online messaging apps I use from both devices well synced. All data, photos, contacts, music, etc from my phone are stored in a cloud service and attainable through my mac computer and my (android) phone. Also your first section “iPhone Apps Are First and Better Looking” contradicts itself. 07/06/2016 Gretchen Alexander Reply My iPhones have NEVER worked great with my PC laptop. NEVER. And the people in the store aren’t much help either. I’ve wasted hours in there. So I don’t know who the person who wrote this article talked to, but my experience has been awful with compatibility between iPhone and PC. In fact, it’s the main reason I’ll never buy another iPhone. 08/10/2015 Malin Saming Reply Really? Here are 10 reasons you have apples for brains: Android is free, Google drive storage is FREE. 15 gig of files, unlimited photos! Androids voice recognition is WAY better, try a comparison, Siri is like a nagging wife who can’t get it right. Android phones have wireless charging! Android phones built in payment that works everywhere. Not at 3% of stores like Apple payment. Android phone MULTITASK, thats right you can run a dozen apps at the same time while talking. Android phones have sizable widgets, so you have live streaming info on your home screen. Android phones are available in endless formats, not like the communist way “everyone has the same”. Android phones PLAY ALL FILES, iphones only play Mp3’s from itunes etc etc pain in the Apple. Android phones have rapid charging, 10 min = 4 hours of use. Android phones are available with 2 days of battery. I could go on and on but your Apple brain will not listen anyways. You probably have a really nice typewriter that you show off the lack of it needing toner or electricity. There is a reason Android is about 82% of the market and Apple has fallen from 33 to about 12%… In fact the remaining iphone users I know all run Google everything on their iphone anyways, why not get the best hardware too. I look at everything I can and see things for how they are, then I buy the best I can find, if you do the same you will love your new Galaxy S6 8^ ) 12/13/2015 Pedro Coimbra Reply I tried, but stop reading after the «iphones only play Mp3’s from itunes etc etc pain in the Apple.» Just this BS of a sentence already has 2 lies in it.

This site shows the majority: https://ninki.co/android-vs-iphone 09/03/2015 Bent Reply Sorry, but that’s it? Honestly, these are more like 15 reasons why an iPhone user should switch to android as soon as possible. Most testify to the fact that Apple product users are chained together under the apple tree, sustaining themselves on apples only. On top of that they are forced to watch android user eat happily from all the trees in the garden, even apples trees, even inventing fruits of their own. 01/25/2016 Real mofo Reply Your clearly insane 09/03/2015 Lodosa Reply Ja wybrałbym androida: http://logoff.pl/ios/wybralbym-androida-a-nie-ponownie-iphone/ 09/03/2015 GoToHell Reply One of the worst article I ever read. And childish comparison . 09/16/2015 Srikanth Reply I can say something here because I own and use both iPhone 6 Plus and a Samusng Galaxy S6 edge equally everyday. So I think I am in a position to give a fair judgement …or at least decide what works better for me. I have changed over from iPhone as my default device to S6 edge and back to iPhone few times. But I find myself using iPhone 6 Plus more often than S6 Edge…because of these reasons 1. Smartphone is smart because of quality apps. I always found iOS apps looking neater, working smoother and more consistent compared to Android Apps. Just to quote an example…Adobe acrobat reader which i made default app to open PDF files….is not able to open files since last two days all of a sudden and reporting error. Everything is updated but still doesn’t work somehow. But works fine with iOS. 2. Screen of iPhone is marginally inferior to my S6 edge which is stunning. But I don’t hold them near my nose and try noticing pixels. From a practical point of view iPhone screen is absolutely fine. 3. In spite of inferior hardware specs on paper, I can’t deny iPhone user interface is more fluid and smooth. Thats what makes the experience more pleasant for me. 4. iPhone 6s is already launched…I am not upgrading. But know what? Last night iOS9 update was available to my phone. I have already updated to same. Isn’t that amazing? I can’t help comparing my Galaxy note 4, my near stock android Motorola droid turbo.. etc..which haven’t received even 5.1.1 Lollipop when Android Marshmallow is about to be launched in a month. Sad. This alone is enough for me to stick to iPhone as my default device. 5. I havent noticed parallels for some Apps in Android (Drafts, Soulver etc). Which I learnt to use often and liked. I am a fan of some automation apps like Tasker on android which doesnt have an iOS equivalent. But as of now my use of same is less. 6. I guess iOS is bit more secure compared to android against virus attacks and hacking. it IS something important to me in this era of mobile banking and when we keep so much data on Google drive and One Note etc. and hey…Google has made most of its apps available to iOS. I agree my S6 edge is superior in Camera department and pictures look very good. Also usage of widgets is better in android. But after using both OS since last 3-4 years, I am sticking with iPhone as my default and S6 edge for miscellany and photos. This is what works for me. I know others have other reasons to stick to any one OS. I have best of both worlds now but can’t help saying one is better than other at present. 12/02/2015 Zombieknight Productions Reply Updates are an invalid point, because the newest version of iOS isn’t as good as a 2 three year old version of Android 12/02/2015 Srikantha Krishna Reply I don’t agree with you there. Updates are important. They optimise the software, remove bugs and important to plug security issues. Of course Google releases them but only nexus customers get it. Other manufacturers don’t release it in time. Tell me now how many handsets are going to get Marshmallow and when???? 04/25/2016 Sally Fallis Reply So which is less complicated for the over-50 me who is good with words but not pictures? I had to ask a young person what all those little dots and waves, etc., meant on my Ipod Touch. I really miss words, but I realize I am alone in that. Is a Samsung any easier to navigate for (duhhh…) me? 07/11/2016 Iggy Z Reply If you are over 50 you should definitely stick with Apple 1. it is extremely easy to use 2. you can do many tasks without even doing anything, but simply telling your phone to wake you up at 5am, or to remind you to take your pills when you get home 3. you can change the text size and icon size to accommodate your eye-sight 4. you can ask any teenager to help you organize the icons into more intuitive way Microsoft Windows phones are rich on words, but while it would satisfy your need for everything being written – the phone will be difficult to use, and will still contain many icons. So, go with Apple, even an older 16GB model, will still be fully supported, and will work perfectly well, do not get 64GB version, you wont need all that memory. 07/16/2016 quenchybro Reply but apple is expensive 08/25/2016 ermm Reply with android it is much easier to use… you can tell your phone to set and alarm….you can change the text size 01/10/2017 Frank McConnell Android is an absurd ecosystem, the UI is very hard to even remember, iOS is better due to the simplicity of the UI. OP was right about iPhones being easy, I use one because android is hard to use. Maybe you should get an iPhone, it’s 5x faster than every android phone in the world and you’ll get a good one on eBay for like $200! Why do you think Google is better on iOS than on android. lel, Android is a joke OS and should be defunct! 10/15/2015 Andras Reply I´ve been an iPhone user for 2 years, recently I bought an Android phone to verify if really Android is superior… After 2 months of testing it, I sell the Android and bought an iPhone 6… This do not prove that iPhone is better, but for my needs, iPhone is totally superior… Android is good, everything is cheap but is not an stable OS… Yes you can have all personalize, but for what? I´m not a teenager anymore so whats the point to have all personalized and change it every week? By the way the output of the sound of the iPhone is really more superior than the output of any Android phone With an iPhone (in music business) is way better you can control lights, console really simple with iPhone and all tech for music is much more easy to sync and to handled on an iPhone… Music business in a MAC is much much easier I love iPhone and I would not change it anymore Like I said I´m not saying iPhone is better for everyone but for my needs yes it is 12/02/2015 Zombieknight Productions Reply Wow! You’re actually dumber than every other I sheep here. IPhone has good sound? Better than any Android? Hahahahahahaha! Have you even seen an HTC One phone? Best speakers and any phone! Ever. IPhone speaker is tinny garbage. The S6 even has the same placement, but sounds much better. Seriously, Google HTC One m8 or m9. Cm8 literally got the top phone of 2014, and everyone mention how good the speakers work. I also got first place cuz it was vastly superior to any iPhone. Better software, better design, better screen, etc 12/02/2015 Zombieknight Productions Reply And please specify what Android phone it was. Otherwise I’ll assume you’re lying because there are so many and you can’t name one. Or you got a cheaper old one. Android high end phones are very stable. Look it up. They’re way more stable than iOS 01/30/2017 Selenia Reply Signed, someone who has never used Viper4Android. Seriously, I can’t stomach the sound output of very many phones without it. Only a few Androids that have nice customized audio processing(like the LG V20) and no iPhones or Windows phones. Many of the rest of Androids can use this superior sound mod. I have a Nexus 6P with Pure Nexus and ElementalX kernel, which has nice front firing speakers, better than iPhones. V4A gives audio processing to match. Not available on iPhones or Windows Phones. 10/17/2015 Tushar Reply Why r u only talking about iphone 6plus,which is much costlier than androide same feature phones, there are some other iphones had launched by apple like iPhone5, 5s,5c i compare this phones whith 20000 rs android phones where battery of iphones so worst and camera and no memory slot, nevertheless this iphones have more cost than android phones. 10/19/2015 Lu Reply LOL you will not get confused using a LIGHTNING cable? are you kidding me?????????

You only choose an Iphone because every one else has an Iphone, if not you would of picked android and said Iphones suck, you also don’t even know how technology works bitch, so I would not be talking because there are far more android devices with better specs, and fyi i’m a kid obviously i’m not employed. 04/22/2016 Derp Reply Well then maybe you didnt know what a high end android phone is.. Poor you. 05/21/2016 Cowbladder Reply This post is what makes you look bad. 05/21/2016 Cowbladder Reply Also, aside from your arrogance making you look bad, you have got to be kidding about BlackBerry. I carried the Z10 now carry the Passport with BB10. I only have it because my company prefers BB’s security. But as far as fuctionality, it’s like working with bear skins and stone knives compared to iPhone or Android. The lack of apps and limited integration with other devices is stifling. That’s why I carry a separate personal phone. It’s also why BB is abandoning BB10 and switching to an Android platform. So are you going to cast off your somewhat acceptable friends who carry BlackBerry when their platform becomes Android? They better run out and get an iPhone when that happens so they can still be honored to be deemed worthy of your friendship. 07/11/2016 Iggy Z Reply 1. Android they switch to is FULLY custom and has all google services BLOCKED 2. This is the reason why companies are abandoning BlackBerry due to high maintenance costs and instead make private applications for iPhones which you can only download using a special code, a secure application within a secure platform, cheaper to maintain, more convenient for an employee to use. I completely agree with Bob, Androids are for 12 year olds and vagrants, the paper specs of Androids (factually and historically) are not an indicator of how they perform. And the fact that you think that you are smarter than a mass of hard working high ranking professionals, and that you need to show them all how “individual” you are by always “personalizing” your phone – just shows you are a fool and have nothing to do but to play with yourself on your phone like a kid, I bet you are one of those people who thinks wearing a watch is stupid and unmanly because you have a clock on your phone. 07/16/2016 quenchybro Reply ur insulting me cos im twelve so dont try piggy 01/30/2017 Selenia Reply You guys keep proving how Apple markets to ignorant people with a credit card. Reason many companies don’t use Android is because of the differences in OS customization from device to device and manufacturer to manufacturer. That can be a nightmare for testing in house apps. Nothing to do with security. My company uses Android tablets, but all the same kind. Only point you are right about is specs don’t reflect performance. Nexus/Pixel devices have good specs, not the best, but just try finding a faster Android or iPhone, for that matter. Why? Stock Android that hasn’t been bastardized. 01/17/2016 Grace Reply I use an iPhone, but custom built my own PC. I don’t like Android phones (had a Samsung galaxy for a year before switching back) but I also don’t like Apple computers. Honestly? What people buy is a matter of taste.

I can literally break this article point by point. I would just like to say one thing though as a rebuttal, A NEXUS too receives the ota updates. An iPhone 64gb on contract costs almost the same as a carrier free nexus. I am a galaxy s7 user and the screen quality is maybe 2 generations over the iphone. As for the notifications, I prefer android’s iteration way more than apples. And about the cables, except the s7, all flagships use USB type c Samsung compensates with wireless charging. The battery life on a nexus or an s7 edge is way superior than the iPhone. And hangout video quality is as good as facetious. Also I like the fact that you don’t need to get out of hangouts to make a video call. In iphone you can usee iMessage but then to make a video call you need to get out and go to facetime. I get to play with manual controls on my camera which iphone doesn’t permit. I can literally go all day long about this. Just one actual good point about iphone you could have mentioned instead of the trash is that it has a stronger graphic processor that but by a small margin. 03/23/2016 sheel r shah Reply One more thing. You mentioned sharing. Do you feel ashamed that you cannot share media via Bluetooth?? The most basic mode of sharing? Talking about airdrop please use wifi direct once. Or nfc sharing. 03/28/2016 Stanata Reply Basically what this article is saying is: “use iPhone instead of Android – it’s more easy to use if you’re an idiot!”… lol There isn’t even one reason of those in the article that is 100% true… and almost all of them are complete crap! I mean come on – even monkey can plug MicroUSB and it is “a must” standard in Europa for instance anyway. Let alone that the future is in the wireless charging… And who today is NOT using Viber or WhatsApp? Who needs another messenger? I can continue, but don’t see point in that – the articles like this is obviously paid one. But sooner or later it will be clear at the end – the open environment will always be above the close one, because it is more close to the people!

It’s a Huawei, nice BIG screen I guess they call a Phablet. My younger son has an iPhone 6 plus. I decided to try an iPhone 5s just to see what it’s like. I have 30 days to check it out. So far, the ONLY thing see is the slow motion camera that’s cool and maybe some cuter emogies …I think they’re called. Otherwise….. I’m so far not impressed. My Huawei Android is 16g the iPhone 5s is 16g. The Huawei was I think $200 and the 5s $160 with its VERY tiny screen. My son has a 6 plus and 64g and that would cost me $650 or maybe it’s $650 for the6 plus 16g. Anyway…. Lots MORE MONEY. I guess if you have a lot of music… It’s better but I just have Lots of pictures. I like my sd card for these. I don’t know all the techy stuff and I don’t do Twitter or FaceTime or sharing pics except Facebook and text.

The iOS Is custom built for and iPhone but the android softwares are not built for any particular device or hardware so optimisation is nog as good as in an Apple device. It not about specs the camera which shas more megapixels cannot alone deliver better pictures , a processor with more cores and greater clock speed can not alone give better performence until it utilises the most of it. So as Apple builds it products to its own requirements and deliver better products than android phones. An iPhone has better quality of internals as well as the body and feels premium than its competitors so that’s why an iPhone is an iPhone. 04/26/2016 De'Zsa Smith Reply Currently on my iPhone 6s+, sobbing as I type this. I’ve just got through longingly browsing Google’s Playstore, seeing all the recent updates of my favorite apps and hidden gems that the Apple Store just cannot compete with. Android has some seriously dedicated developers, and I’ve always admired them and even began looking into Android app development. That is… Until I switched over to iPhone several months ago after being a dedicated Android user. I will always be Team Android, hands down. I had a rooted Nexus 5, which means I’m all about customizability, design, testing, flexibility, and freedom. Then I decided I wanted to try something new—FaceTime, great camera, updated social apps like snapchat…you know, the basics. Biggest. Mistake. Ever. Switching over to Apple feels like I’m using a flip phone. Now I’m trying to decide if I should just switch back, or keep this iPhone as a means of communication (don’t know if I’m willing to give up FaceTime with family and friends) and have an Android for all the things I miss. 04/27/2016 weez Reply I just giggle at these articles. Ok Iphone kids, my phone has a webhost, tftp server, a windows deploy share with every iteration of windows going back to w2000, an SMB client, FTP client and host, Tftp server, wi-fi signal scanner, packet sniffer(nmap), a high frequency oscilloscope, a bluetooth HID remote that controls anything bluetooth, a linux/android debugger, point of sale and inventory tracking software(apple has it too but not complete on the phone), and at will I can change my MAC and spoof other phone’s IDs. My phone is a half decade old S2. So I guess if you plan on propping up a desk buy an Iphone, for everyone else that has work to do either grab a toolkit full of different things or just grab your android phone. 04/28/2016 Ken McDowell (@morpheusxp) Reply I don’t understand why it is all Android users say that iPhone users are sheep and that they use an iPhone because everyone else uses an iPhone.

Just saying… 05/21/2016 Cowbladder Reply I think it is more because a lot of iPhone users seem cultic. I honestly think iPhone is a high quality product. But I really like high end Androids as well. However, I know people who use only Apple products and make little comments here and there about how inferior ALL Androids are. In that way I think they are like sheep because they have bought into this notion that their are no good Androids and they are operating on a higher plan than non-iPhone users. 05/23/2016 Anthony Reply Agreed. Probably because in the beginning people lined up outside of stores to get the latest and greatest iphone. It’s great hardware, but I can’t get used to a single button. Plus iphones seem to have a higher resale value. I don’t know. I do like how apple updates their devices in a timely manner and no bloatware, etc. I think Android is getting there, but unless it’s a nexus, updates are all over the place. I want the screen of a Samsung, build of an HTC with the battery life of my droid turbo, a headphone jack at the bottom of the phone instead of the top and I would be in heaven. Plus everyone I know say is that a Galaxy? So people in my area associate anything android as a Galaxy. Great marketing by Sammy, but perception becomes reality sometimes. 05/21/2016 Cowbladder Reply Meant to say plane, not plan. ☺ 01/30/2017 Selenia Reply Yup, it is about the Apple cult and the attitude that you are unwashed and not worthy if you use an Android. The attitude you must be broke, homeless, etc. My Android costs as much as a lower range current iPhone and can do way more. Here in the US, they have much greater market share, unfortunately. 04/28/2016 Joe Reply iphone has nothing on android. They have a good camera but that is about it. isheep all butthurt because android is taking over the world. 04/30/2016 qwertypop13 Reply So far all my favourite android apps were not available on ios, plus a lot of apps are a minimum of 10 cent cheaper on gpl than on apple app store. I also find it totally ridiculous that iphones need to be jailbroken to undergo any form of customization. Plus who wants fast updates at the expense of severe bugs, them slowing down stuff even more and getting a crappy operating system that hasnt changed since 5 years. Iphones are for people that only use their phones to txt and make calls. ps. I have a $20 alcatel phone and wouldnt ever trade it for an iphone. Buy what you like, but the points on this website are the worst I have ever seen. As far as I know you cant even use iphones to transfer files other than audio and photos to and from macs/pc’s. Apple phones are overpriced by like $500 dollars just because they have a flashy logo which they stole from the beatles. 05/05/2016 anthony Reply I love my android devices. Have I had problems. Yes. More than my wife’s iphone? Definitely. But I tinker with it a lot more than her iphone. I transfer files back and forth from a computer a lot easier with my device. Yes using third party apps but it’s still easier. I have all my music in google play, but use itunes (whole family uses ipods) so I just sync up that to google music and playlists as well. Each device has it’s pros and cons. I have used a rooted tablet to get pure android (didn’t like it) and have an ipad 2 which I love. It’s about choice and I like that we have it. Two points I agree with the author about: Timely updates and bloatware. HTC is bucking the trend to stay afloat by addressing this. Wireless charging is not worth it yet. I much prefer quick charging and new devices starting to roll out with usb-c. 05/07/2016 C Reply The article and ensuing comments are a joke. This is what The internet has come to now days. Let me be clear, I have years and years of experience with Android, IOS, Windows & Linux. I have every certification and more hours logged on to these then most of you. Now that we have established my far superior ability to actually comment here goes. First of all, the people on this blog and on others like it simply cannot help the fact that more people love iphone than android, period. So they make nasty little comments because they are frustrated that in reality they couldnt influence people in high school and they aren’t able to now. Second the android users who get angry at Apple users simply appear to only be mad because they don’t have an iphone them selves. Guys! Really! Let me be clear I have Windows and android and iOS. Iphone for the nomal every day user is PERFECT! Let them be! The android is perfect for more shady people who want to be power users an anarchists or some how feel like they are breaking the law or the rules. That is how android feels and that’s the base line of the os. I currently have an android because I can be one of those more shady people who like to go against the grain. But I don’t like android. Who the he’ll wants to root a phone? Who wants to spend hours on doing something? Not I! It takes me 10 minutes to jail break an Apple as and BAM I’m a super users with a linux based system and am sitting with a very powerful device! They all being said I have an android bc of expandable memory, an IR blaster, and a few other small features. When Apple steps up the game with these I will switch to Apple. Here is one reason why. What is a smart device? It is an item created to make your life as a human eaiser. Apple does that by leaps and bounds! The phone thinks of you like a loyal old dog and wants to do nothing more than serve your every whim. I can tell you the iphone holds up better, know why? Ever had to fix your mom or dads PC? And you think to your self wth are they doing with this thing. We never hear that issue out of iphone. So really is a beast just for that reason alone simply bc the general population can break them by doing stupid stuff. Now on to adress some other stupid comments for people who pretend they are SO smart. Windows is better than a Mac ios! Hum WRONG! Know why? Windows is a dos based crap system with a gui created for the average consumer to use a device. It’s not a damn computer it’s a pretty device to help you numb skulls use paint and word or get on the internet. What is my point now!! Oh yet MAC IOS is FAR superior at least for anyone who actually knows how to use Linux which by the way was and still is the base os on which all other smart software was and still is created. So you pretty little Windows fanboy users, please get a grip because until you stop drooling over your poster size photo of Bill gates and actually learn Linux you know nothing about computing. The really dumb person who commented about Honda’s vs Chevys! Hahaha seriously though? You also probably know nothing right? Honda and GM use the exact same part manufactures which in turn makes both cars CRAP! Research before you comment. Go get what ever phone you want and fanboys of each need to get a grip! 05/29/2016 C Reply Just to clarify a few things for the “people who pretend they re SO smart” Windows has been detached from DOS since windows 2000, It maintains compatibility by running an DOS virtual machine on the NT Kernel. Not all systems are based on Linux, Linux is based on Unix, Mac OS (and IOS) is largely based on BSD which is a variant of UNIX, The Windows Micro-kernel is also partly based on UNIX. For someone who has “years and years of experience with Android, IOS, Windows & Linux.” and “every certification and more hours logged on to these then most of you” you are spreading a lot of misinformation. I personally own all apple products, but have and still use the other platforms, They all have their advantages and downfalls. And although I use a Mac, Ipad and Iphone predominantly I still have moments of frustration when I miss windows, android and linux for one reason or another. 05/29/2016 CC Reply Not the same “C” as above btw 05/18/2016 Nikhil Bansal Reply Great Information.

But when it comes to the games the android will never be smooth as Apple or faster the performance in apple will always be better. But android will only have a bit better graphics because of its amoled technology 06/02/2016 Jacob Reply If you wanted to make this a fair comparison you’d compare it against Vanilla Android so it’d be the Nexus 6p and immediately your points about bloatware and cable become invalid. Also, how can you say apple doesn’t come with bloatware? Have you tried removing the stocks app recently? What about file sharing, have you never heard of Android Beam? Or the fact almost every flagship has a fingerprint scanner now? This is the most poorly written, one sided piece of crap I’ve seen in a long time. How do you even have a job? P.s. I own a Nexus 6p for private use and iPhone 6s Plus for work and they’re pretty much equal in every way except for the Nexus having a better screen, free apps, faster charging and longer battery life. 07/16/2016 quenchybro Reply +1 lol 06/03/2016 alpharidley9098 Reply This article made me laugh pretty hard. I just love the reasons they give for the phone being better. Now 1 thing that is always MORE important than ALL of these is the actual phone. Also, those apps that come with the phone, it depends on what you are getting… Also, you do know apple is making a switch to MicroUSB right? Humph. Seems like just in this 1 paragraph I have already made better points than this article. Anyways, phone-wise, androids are almost always more powerful than an apple phone because of the fact that iPhones are never equip with a good core or a good amount of RAM. They slow down quite quickly and seem obsolete after a few months. Yes. Months. I have had my Moto G3 for awhile and it is still ultra fast and has no technical issues. 06/03/2016 Jens Lipponer Reply problem with iphones is that u need itunes etc.. and too many permissions. I like to just plug in and drag and drop files…. I don’t give a monkey’s behind whether apps look better or what not. let’s be honest, price wise the iphone is beaten every time. there is just no bang for buck. I laugh at people who buy these things for the show off appeal as I know they are getting ripped in a rather large way……… 06/08/2016 Mohamed Faizul Reply I used android for 7 years this is my first iphone 5s bought two years back From the day i bought this iphone till now regularly i m browsing in website that why iphone is better than android, why iphone is better than android,why iphone is better than android,why iphone is better than android but while using android i m much okay with everything…. iPhone is simple best for call ,messaging ,camera with instant speed though its two year old device … But not more than that In android its like sea u can do lot lot more than iphone but not as quality standard reliability fast easy as iphone . 06/09/2016 Ryan Reply Has anyone thought that maybe iPhone is more simple than Android simply because the staff aren’t smart enough to produce anything more complicated than simple? It seems obvious to me. At least Android screens don’t break when you drop the phone on carpet like iPhone’s do. There’s Applecare because the iPhones break like a window hit by a baseball because the whole phone is either thin aluminum or covered in glass (which is a hazard if the glass shards cut you and potentially make you bleed out). The aluminum iPhone’s are currently being made of bend in your pocket! They’ll need some high quality flexible glass and easily bent straight CPU (without anything on the inside being destroyed). By the way, for the vibration thing on Android you don’t have to input password or anything just click the power button and hold down the turn down volume button for a second or two and that’s it. 06/10/2016 Shaggy C Reply So your reasoning is half “It’s popular” and most the other half is comparing apple features to the bad features of a multitude of android phones? The whole usb bit is quite a stretch too. You’re just another iSheep. 06/12/2016 11112222 Reply android is way better than android its an open source os which means you can customize everything literally and you can’t say that ios is better than android because snapchat looks “prettier ” what are you? 5years old girl. and apple users are like a bunch of sheeps. apple never lets you do anything without their” ok” and many other that makes an apple device less than an android one in conclusion android is better than apple 06/13/2016 useyourIQ Reply its very funny coz all of them are WRONG :D XD Please use a droid phone before you write an article about it….

It could be called Android or robot or Apple or peaches or dog poo. All I care about is having a good phone that can do the most. Phones are expensive. I’m not buying a brand name. I’m looking to buy something that has everything it could possibly have if I’m going to spend that kind of money. You’re “reasons” show good things about IPhone, but are not “reasons” as to why it’s better. IPhones are good phones. People like IPhones because it’s a trend. It’s popular. That’s it. IPhones are not even close to androids. Be truthful. Androids are mini-computers. Literally. IPhone is not. You can do 100 more things with Android that you cannot do with IPhone. The That is the truth. And Apple products are a lot more expensive. Why would anyone pay more for a phone that gives you less? It boggles my mind. Android has variety. There are many, many phones, companies, styles to choose from. They even offer cheaper options that get the job done. They have an SD card slot. Why would anyone dish out $100’s more for more storage? That SD card is yours forever. For future phones or other devices. You can plug your phone into your computer and save(on the phone or SD card) anything (music, photo’s, video’s, contacts) and it’s yours. Without having to go through ITunes or anything else. Apple doesn’t own my stuff. I own it. And I can customize anything I own. There are IPhone stores for these little nick knacks. Transferring files, contacts, etc. It’s like going to a car dealership. One side has a variety of great cars. The other side has one car that is the most expensive. You see that all the other cars have a ton of features, options, colors to choose from, engines, horse power, cylinders, 2-door, 4-door, SUV’s etc. You ask “what’s so great about this lonely more expensive car tht only comes in one model and doesn’t have these other options?” The saleman replies with “Because it’s popular”. 07/06/2016 Gretchen Alexander Reply Yes, this!

I have two iPhones now, a 5 and a 6, that I can’t get my photos off of onto my PC laptop. I’ve gone into the Crapple store more than three times and still haven’t gotten them off. My idea of HELL is the Crapple store! I hate that place. There’s hardly room to stand and then you end up being sat at a table waiting with a bunch of other frustrated people waiting for a tech to help you. Of course this is after you make an appointment, or in my case last time, two appointments. I don’t see that as a plus at all because not only is going there a royal pain in the ass, but then they don’t even offer much help after several hours. My iPhone does not recognize as a drive when I plug it into my PC. It used to, and then stopped. I don’t want to have to use iTunes to transfer photos or music. I want to just plug it in and have it be a drive and copy whatever files I like back and forth. It does not work; and I’ve spent, literally, hours trying to get it to function that way. I also have a pretty complex DSLR camera and yet it is still easy as can be to transfer the photos from the memory card onto the computer. So why can’t a supposedly user-friendly phone just do the same thing? I seriously hate my iPhone 6 so much I wanted to shoot it, except I discovered it’s worth a good bit of money still so I’ll sell it on ebay. 07/09/2016 Joey Reply A lot of childish responses from android fans here. I gave the nexus 6p and try for 2 months after my old iPhone broke. Hardware was great, but I found on this android phone the app integration and interoperability to be no where near as good as an iPhone. Apple is just better when it comes to form and function. Buy an android if you want to tweak it forever and play in a sandbox, buy and iPhone if you need a productive phone. 07/10/2016 Colin Reply Your comment may not be childish but it is not correct. Comparable Android phones have far better form and function. Take the iPhone 6s plus verses a Note 5 or s7 Edge. The Apple is bigger and heavier yet packs has a smaller or same sized screen as the Samsung’s’ yet has far less features. Both these phones are far more productive, can multi-task properly, be fully customized and allow widgets on lock and home screens for speed, convenience and ease of use. The Note even includes a stylus or pencil. Great compact design, fully featured and greater functionality (Android) vs Heavy outdated bloated hardware with mid-range specs and limited functionality (IOS). Not to forget the limited compatibility of iPhones and lack of choice! 07/10/2016 Chris Reply There are facts, then there are opinions. 07/10/2016 Colin Reply This article is a disgrace, misleading at best. Most of the reasons are just not true or highly debatable. 07/12/2016 Benito Paul Reply congratulation all of u commented on weather iphone or android’s is the best In my point of view it may be any phone that is android or iphone. If we had a phone that should meet our requirements.Requirements means each and every people has different requirements in case of security,memory capacity and so and so. Hence apple or iphone buy any thing because all are vanity, “vanity of vanities” 07/14/2016 aileen Reply I’m someone who switched from android to ios but this article is utter bullshit. Yes, I love my iPhone and i’m so glad I switched by my samsung galaxy 4 was nothing but shit lately but these arguments in the article are dumb as hell. Lightning is better than micro usb? excuse me, what? my iphone takes ages to charge (iphone 6) whereas my s4 charged within an hour. i don’t see how that makes micro usb bad. but well my iphone battery lasts over a day and my old phone could have never. sharing location isn’t hard on android since almost everyone uses whatsapp bc imessage doesn’t exist on android and whatsapp has a location sharing option so that argument was dumb. yes, apps do look prettier on ios but i don’t see how only that would be a reason to switch?? this article clearly comes from someone who has only owned apple devices and doesn’t even know what they’re talking about, if you really want to prove a point you need to ask someone who has used BOTH of the things you’re trying to compare otverwise you’re just gonna embarass yourself. just saying. 07/20/2016 KappaPride Reply Why are you guys even arguing about this? 07/24/2016 George Reply The major advantage iOS has over Android is that Apple designs the phone and software. Whereas for Android (open source) other manufacturers have to play with it to get it to work and sometimes it’s not fluid. Take the Nexus phones for example…they just work like the iphones. No bloatware..nothing (like the iphone). Majority of my friends have iPhones and sometimes I wish I did too because of MMS (iMessage). I used both and I hate that i have to use itune for everything but it is what it is I guess. 07/24/2016 Landry Reply I’m 8 years experimented developer for iOs devices and I say that Apple releases so frequent updates because iOs is just a stone age OS to fool iOs users that Apple works seriously behind their products. It must run to compete Android OS. 07/27/2016 Aza Reply Best to have both. I have an Se and G4 best of both worlds 07/30/2016 Bob Reply So many things piss me off in this article but specifically stood out Notifications I have no idea with this author is saying he obviously hasn’t seen an android phone, they are exactly the same. Lightning vs. Micro-USB Micro-USB usually charges everything from headphones, to power banks, and of course cell phones. And multiple times to insert it is an absurd comment, after about a week you’ll probably memorize which way it goes, and how do you insert it incorrectly more than once. And USB type-C is just starting to come to the mainstream that’s why it’s not on everything. Storage Why do people even buy the 128 GB version, not to get apps but to download media like pictures, videos, music, etc. I agree with the statement about how sd cards are treated but there’s a much more simple solution, buy a larger storage option. Sharing purchased content Sign into the play store with the account that originally bought the content, install it, then sign out. Problem solved, and if anyone says “it’s more convenient” think about how often you might actually purchase something that costs actual money, I’ll bet it’s probably less than once a week. And it doesn’t take long to sign in and then back out 08/14/2016 Adso Rossi Reply I love iPhones. They always have nice designs and I like the simple interface. I have been itching to get an SE with its smaller dimensions (I like small phones). Money is not a problem to me but as much as I really want one I will stick with my Android device. Why? Cause the compatibility of iPhones to Windows pcs are real bad or none. You’d say “get a Mac” but I can’t: too many programs I need that unfortunately are only Windows-available. If this one single point of compatibility would be addressed, the iPhone becoming as compatible as Androids, I would get that iPhone SE in a heartbeat! 08/21/2016 nathanlittles plays minecraft Reply Who the hell needs iPhone I can name 100 reasons why Android is better but I’ll just name 20 1. Freedom 2. Apk 3. More sizes 4. More colours 5. Waterproof phones 6. Big and small tablets instead of the HUGE iPad 7. Clear cache option 8. For apps and also all the app store apps 9. No need for jailbreak but if you root you’re device will have no restrictions :D 10. Notification swipe 11. Google now 12. Google maps instead of the crappy apple maps 13. Multiple users feature 14. SD card storage So you don’t run out of storage easily like on the 16 gig iPhones (128GB or even 256GB) 15. Pattern unlock 16. There’s everything on Google play store even GPS spoofers to do the Pokémon go spoof in like 2 seconds 17. Unknown sources option 18. No need for an apple I’d all you need is a Google account which is way easier to set up and use 19. Get apps that are not out in your country easier (Pokémon go) 20. Android sounds better then apple 08/22/2016 Jim Reply This article made me so angry I must go punch a kitten. It’s an interesting psychological phenomenon, our emotional ties to brand loyalty. It’s as if the device we choose to use says something about who we are as people, and there is some ancient war of two types of people being waged through our genetics. Apple users are like Yankee fans, Android users are the goth kid outsiders. And the war rages on. 08/30/2016 Deleau Clément Reply Hi. Please kill yourself.

Like, the notifications. Android is wayyy better. You clear all at once or swipe. It combines like notifications that you can separate. It allows to interact with the notification and app without opening it and its just, way simpler and cleaner. 09/10/2016 Nigel Nderi Reply Let me settle this. Choose an iPhone if you are incompetent or are ok with a company controlling you’re phone completely. Choose an Android if you want to be able to enjoy the latest technologies and can competently manage it’s abilities without whining that it takes more than half a brain cell to use. 09/11/2016 Josh Mcduff Reply Just read all the comments and wow it’s all he said she said. I’ve had my Nexus 6p which btw one poster said it’s Google made nope huewei or whatever. Point is not the same, for about a year now and I’m now getting the iPhone 7. Are the specs pretty damn similar? Yes alot of the same features? Yes update often? Yes Nexus gets all the Android ones first like Apple. Price? Actually the 7 is less than the Nexus by about 150.00 CAD sooo that defeats the argument about price… Just saying. I love my Nexus but I’m open to changing. Ice bounced back and forth alot between Android and iOS can I say one is superior to the other? Absolutely not it all comes down to does it do what I want it to and can I afford it. 09/12/2016 Lee Reply All good and well people love free stuff but free stuff comes with a price of selling your info to the uncontrollable thirst party. iPhone also offer easy printing option than android you have to download something that will ask you to upgrade by paying just to use your printer no way! Also iPhone helps stop third party apps that try to use your phone making phone calls example if you are searching for nearest restaurant Google will show the call number to the same restaurant but when you try to call instead of calling direct the parasite apps like whatsaapp, text… And more they pop up asking you to use them making a call while they can’t function without your service they bug you each time taking away the time you spend trying to make a call. If you’re in a hurry and these app try to suggest you use it think how buggy this is. The same applies to text messages. 09/15/2016 Jada Reply Have u really owned an android?

Apple has had to recall their product so many times because people died from the battery exploding. And with Apple every 3rd phone they stop making updates for it. Android always has updates for their products. Plus Apple owes the government 37 billion dollars Android doesn’t. The iPhone 7 that is coming out is a total ripoff. They copied Samsung. Apple has never made a crack resistance screen and a waterproof phone. Samsung is simply better. 09/17/2016 Rob Doyle Reply I completely am for people having their own opinion, that being said I disagree with the title of this article. That being said without any bias coming into play here, some of the points that the author was trying to make aren’t true or aren’t completely true. 1. “Works with all your devices”… The real title should be works better with all of your APPLE devices. The examples in the article are all apple examples. The author obviously has no experience with android or windows. 2. “Faster Updates”…. Compared to what android device? You can’t just say that Iphones get updates faster and compare that to all android phones. The way that this section was written made it sounds like the day an update is release for Android, nine of there phones get it immediately like the iPhones… this just isn’t true. If you have a nexus you get updates as they are released (just like and iPhone) There is a bunch of other examples that just show the author has no experience with android devices, I’m just going to keep this short. People will choose what they think is best for them. My issue is with the author, not the opinion. All the argument were completely based on opinion and not facts. People are going to read this and take it all as fact, instead of doing research and finding the right device for them. 09/18/2016 Jonathan Masters Reply I have both an iPhone 5 and a Galaxy S7. While there are some advantages to the iPhone, there are several reasons why I just can’t make a permanent switch. First, no home screen widgets (like my calendar and agenda). Sure, you can add something like that to the notifications screen, but that involve swiping, as opposed to right on the home screen. Second, it’s so difficult — even annoying — trying to organize files on the iPhone. On an Android, it operates exactly like a computer should (and our phones really are computers these days), with folders, subfolders, etc., so you can just copy the files to where you want them for later use. You can’t do that on an iPhone, where all of your files go to some mysterious and deep “collection” on the phone. If Apple were to add those two features, then I’d happily switch away from Android. 09/21/2016 de Coulon Thierry Reply I wanted to try an iPhone, so I got an old one. I could simply not install anything because everything on the AppStore has moved to iOS > 7. I could not bring a single file to the phone. All it would do is sync with iTunes on my Mac, but there is nothing to sync because I don’t use this Mac for everyday life. The iPhone I got did not have any smart way to save battery. The iPhone I got could not play any of my music because a) I could not upload it and b) I could not install anything that would play ogg files. The iPhone I got was heavier, thicker and less good looking than my current Sony. So OK it was an old iPhone, but 90% of what I say would be true for the latest iPhone, and at what price! If you live in the Apple world, then an iPhone is probably the logical choice. I live in the Linux world and now I know I’ll never take another look at an iPhone. 09/24/2016 Jim Washko Reply Worldwide stats – Android users 82% vs IOS users 18% There’s not enough votes to even tilt the scale towards IOS being better. Being as the story indicates Android phones are only good for 2 years that makes them more expensive. How can IOS users explain why 82% of the market would rather pay more for less?, if that were in fact true. Iphone offers less control, poor resoluion, no expandable memory and not all phones can share the same apps. Android offers all of it as well as compatible with Windows whcih is currently at 80% of the market share. This is like comparing the Yugo to Prius. Sure the Yugo is cheaper at first, but after a year of so, not so much. Iphone resale is more, but that will drop due to fewer and fewer users as they get tired of the box of crayons with only black and white as an option. when they can get the box of 64 and a sharpener 09/24/2016 Capi Reply Is this all a big joke? You keep saying “iPhone is better than Android” about ten times in the article, like a mantra we have to learn and assimilate, Am I the only one who noticed this? I have and iPad, and iMac and I used iPhone (4, 4s and 5) I am familiar with both iOS and OSX but actually I have an Android and installed Windows 10 on my iMac. OSX is a good system if you like simple and easy interfaces, I don’t really have any problem with it, is a really good system once you learn to do things that are diferent with Windows, like formating drives with Disk Utility. (And if we forget how difficult could be for some people to use drive formats like NTFS in a Mac) But iOS, thats another story, Apple manufactures iPhone and developes a OS which works perfectly with that device, which, supposedly, makes it safer. There ends all iOS and iPhone REAL advantages. There are a lot of reason to say Android is better than Android, but the main reason is that you can freely add and delete files from it. I connect my Android to my computer, I press “Windows key” + “E” and immediately I see all my drives and my Android device there, and I can drag or delete files from it. But when I connect an iPhone I have sync up files with iTunes. Why the hell people think synchronization is good? For example, I spent one week adding all my music from CDs to my iTunes library, then I synced my iPhone and… voilá, my music was there. Then my computer died, and my music adquired during years with my money was completely lost, just because I didn’t buy it to Apple. But hey, music was still on my iphone, but NO, I need a third party program, which costs money or could be a malware, just to upload my songs again to a new computer. (Of course I have all my CDs, but thats a week lost) Im simply asking you to do like me if you can, just try everything, because if I read this article (iPhone is better, iPhone is better, iPhone is better…) I have the feeling that not everyone, but many people conform with iPhone. Just for popularity, for Apple fanaticism, or just because a website is telling you to buy it with superliminal advertising. 09/26/2016 wgallagher142 Reply I actually find that android apps have become much prettier and definitely more modern than iPhone apps at this point. Twitter, Facebook, all the google apps, as well as plenty of others have better looking designs on Android now than on iPhone thanks in large part to material design! 09/27/2016 Simon Reply What a crock of misinformed shite 09/28/2016 Eugene Reply ANDROID IS BETTER Really. Devices cheaper, but they have similar power with iPhones. And it’s open-source, you can customize it all over you want.

I plug the phone to any pc or laptop with Windows and I can access and modify the memory and sd card just like you do with an USB flash drive. 2) probably my favourite Android feat: if I don’t like a new update for an App I just download the previous version (you can get the whole updates hystory as .apk files of virtually every single app found in Google Play on the web) and there I have my dear older version that works so much better for me. This “roll-back” possibility is just pure gold. 10/01/2016 don Reply Blackberry rules 10/03/2016 B BALL Reply F**k all of you stop writing huge ass stories and go back to 1st grade to learn your grammar and if you like android the os systems are freakin names of candy!! 10/07/2016 Scuba Turtle Reply I can do all of this with my Andriod plus a lot more that an Iphone just cannot do. 10/16/2016 Sally Fallis Reply This is for Charles Alden.

At least I got that right. 10/07/2016 Majid Reply None of these arguments accounts for any good reason to buy an iPhone except argument number 1. Android can do these equally or better. I have been a heavy android user till date until yesterday when I bought iPhone 7 plus. I own an iPad since two years. I am happy with my iPad which I use mainly for games and some handwriting. Yes I was annoyed from android. I owned s3. It had, due to some reason, a built in issue which I only realized after warranty finished. My faulty s3 obliged me to hate Samsung and android. Then I bought note 4. It solved all my problems I faced on s3. But still there were some things I did not feel good about. Now after purchasing iPhone 7plus 128 GB I understand the power of google. The three apps Google search, google maps and google drive are enough reason to close down iPhone factory from the face of earth. 10/10/2016 BM Reply Thinking to upgrade from s5. Thought for iPhone 7. But it can not do even 5 % work compared to android. My andrioid mobile automatically silents itself when I enter meetings or office. Automatic meeting mode when meeting is scheduled (only beeps) I can give my mobile to anyone to see coz I have app specific fingerprint. Only sensitive apps are protected. All other is open. These are not possible with apple except jailbreak. These are just samples. I can write journal what android can do. Speed is not important with a Ibrick which can not do anything smart. I’m not a fan of apple or Samsung. I want my work to be done and my pocket secretary to work according to my requirements. 10/10/2016 Charles Alden Reply 15 reasons why Android is better. Reason number one, you have an actual file system. Anyone who has dealt with iOS horrendous file management paradigm appreciates the ease as at which files are accessible in Android. You simply click on Open, navigate to where your files are stored, select, done. There is also never any reason to use the Share function except when sharing data with the internet. Number 2, multitasking, iOS’s multitasking absolutely sucks, especially when you compare it to Android. Example, I can stream a film to my TV wirelessly, while compiling an application via a remote terminal, while downloading a 40GB file directly to my NAS drive which is mounted as a local folder, while I convert a media file to .mp4, while I play N64, 007 Goldfinger using a replica N64 USB game controller. I’m able to select my own default apps, so when I download a file and click open, the app that I normally use for that extension opens up automatically. I have a global search function, which is one of the worst things about iOS, how do you find files. That was rhetoric, you can’t, it’s basically hunt and peck. I can customize voice commands, this is perhaps one of the coolest things about about Android. I have around 250 custom voice commands, mostly for searching files. Such as, “show me all file [file extension] created on [date]. Even photos, show me all photos from [city] on [particular date/month, years], even for a particular person , “show me all photos for [name] on [particular date/month, year]” External display support, when am connect my phone to a monitor not only is the resolution fully supported but so is the aspect ratio. Mouse support, while connected to a monitor I can use a mouse and a keyboard. Even when not connected to a phone, having access to a mouse is an absolute must when using a tablet as a laptop. USB peripheral support, so besides mouse support, my phone supports a TB external HD, HP All-In-One printer in which the scanner even works, USB replica game controllers in which a have one for the N64, SNES, Sega and PlayStation. Better overall specs, I have a 2K AMOLED display, 6GB of RAM, USB C, SD Card reader, HDMI out support, etc. I can use a custom desktop LDPI, I changed my LDPI to 380 which is the LDPI that activates tablet mode, which means all of my apps are a lot more powerful than the normal phone UI ones. I can customize my entire system to what I want it to be, give it personality, iOS users have been using the same system UI for the last 9 years. There is absolutely nothing I can’t customize. Inner app communication is a lot better, since iOS has a Walled off prison, or so called Walled Garden, apps communicate via API’s, which is the root of everything wrong within iOS. Anyway as stated above, I don’t have to use some half assed sharing function which creates a copy of the file your sharing every time you use it to open up my files within multiple apps, I simply click on Open. I can even open up the same file within multiple apps at the same time. I never, ever have to create more than one file, I just use the original file, always. I can use Linux under a Chroot, meaning I have a full Debian server running under my phone. Why would you want this, well first of all I have CLI applications like; Python, Perl, PHP, MySQL, Apache, etc. I have all of my favorite Linux GUI applications installed like; Dia, Inkscape, Gimp, BlueFish, etc. I can use my phone as a desktop computer, this one might sound weird but not only is it possible, it works incredibly well. Especially when my phone has 6GB of RAM and a Qualcomm 821. Like I said above I have all of my favorite Linux GUI applications installed in which a bring them up using a xterminal, when I’m at work I have access to about a hundred different Windows applications via a Citrix client which works fantastically. All of my applications including the ndroid ones are opened up in individual windows, so none of that dual app view non-sense. In which in iOS less than 0.5% out of a million plus apps actually support. I have access to widgets, they might not interest you but they are extremely handy. I can use wireless chargers. I can use custom ROMs, even completely different OS’s like Ubuntu Touch, SailFish, etc. I will never, ever not be able to run the latest version of Android. When a manufacturer stops updating their phone, no problem, I just install a custom ROM and they work fantastically. My phone is a computer, a real powerhouse, a real smartphone. Every time I use an iPhone I absolutely hate the experience. I mean even to type a post like this I would have to use a text editor as I would be afraid to loose all of my work as anytime you switch to another app, Safari just resets. It has happened to me numerous times, it’s why sites have started saving drafts, not for the Android users but iOS users. Though what bothers me the most is the lack of multitasking, yes, sure, there are a few apps that can run in the background but they are far and few and none of them are the ones that I need or want to use. Than there is the file system or I should say lack of, dealing with files IOS is simply a complete nightmare. Anytime someone at the office who uses an iPhone gets sassy with me about having an Android phone I simply ask them to show me their user directory, what, you can’t mount it, why not, your phone is so great. Not only do I have my remote server directly mounted as a local directory on my phone but my workstation and all of my cloud services as well, all accessible within any app installed. Again, my phone is also my desktop computer and why not, it’s not only powerful enough but more than capable. I couldn’t believe how horrible the external display support was on my iPad Pro, which I recently replaced with a Lenovo YogaBook, best decision I ever made. Talk about a complete makeover on how I work, I’m actually productive now. I can create detailed reports, all in the background and automatically, I have access to a scripting language, automation, multi-user support with OpenID to access my firms internal network, a real Office suite, MS Office for iOS was a complete joke, there isn’t even a import feature, scripting language, nope, database support, nope, by the way, I have the Android version. Which opens up every app under their own window, iOS’s dual app support on the iPad Pro was a joke, hardly anything supports it and that drag and drop feature, only apps designed by the same developer can use it, so MS Word to MS Excel yes, MS Word to Apple photos, no, useless. Yes, my post is huge, but this authors best 15 reasons why the iPhone is a joke. Almost everything listed I have on either my Yoga Book or new Xiaomi Mi 5s Plus or don’t need it as it’s a waste. In fact 90% of the so called new features in iOS 10 are useless. I held on to my iPad Pro thinking iOS 10 would be a game changer, not only was it not, but there wasn’t a single feature that improved my experience. Apple keeps skipping over every feature that we actually want, need. If your happy with multitasking, file management, the fact that you can’t select your own default apps, lack of customizations, horrible external display support, lack of USB C, limited NFC, horrible USB peripheral support, especially mouse support. Horrible inner app communication including the Sharing function in which took Apple 8 years to even release that crap, ugh, the list just goes on and on and …………. 10/11/2016 Gigi Reply This is one of the most biased articles I have ever read on complementing Apple. I am an adult, I don’t need Apple to limit what I can do with my phone and what I can share and who I can share with. I have used Iphone before and it surely not my cup of tea. 10/12/2016 Emma squire Reply Okay Listen what I think is that you have written an article telling the blank truth of your mind. But you see I have an iPhone 6s,iPod 5,MacBook air, MacBook Pro, Samsung TV with built in smart tv, Samsung galaxy tablet pro and I don’t mind Samsung to be truthful. Also I find that Apple is more easier to use but harder to switch from an iOS device to an LGphone. Emma squire, 11y/o from Aus. 10/14/2016 Babble Reply Let’s face it… I use an android lollipop but after comparing and visualizing the specifications.. One can truly say that iPhone is way more better than android. ..though we need to invest some bucks unlike android phones. 😀 10/14/2016 Huen Reply iOS is superior to Android. I was suckered in buying 2 android devices the samsung galaxy s3 and the nexus 4. I gave it a try because my friends raved about android. They are smart people who generally have great advice and knowledge on technology. So I said I’ll give it a shot because they have good judgement. However I found out that their judgement were out of biased hatred toward apple. Android devices: 1. on paper they have more ram, sometimes quicker cpu clock speed, higher resolution etc. however real life performance tests apple out scores android devices, just check geek bench and speed tests. As for higher resolution our eyes dont even detect the larger resolutions. 2. I found out the hard way, downloaded apps that just didnt work for my device. Google needs to improve this I dont know if they are better now but man they need to detect the hardware your using and tell you ahead of time before you download and install an app that its compatible with your device! 3. customizations my butt!! Its a great idea so called if all your launchers actually look good! haha I tried all these loaders for my s3 and they were all ugly. Just go with apple, its like saying would you hire great designers for your house and you would just let them have their way in designing the house for you or would you want to design it yourself? doesnt make sense look at xiaomi great example they just copy everything apple does and it looks great. Dont hire cheap designers to design the way your phone looks and works. 4. OS – android’s solution to everything is “oh just download this app to make it work or oh just kill this task or reduce brightness or this or that” why?! If I’m paying 1k for a phone why does it not just work? Why must I non stop have to tweak things on my phone to get save battery or make things work? For instance for whatsapp there was no function built into the app that when I want to send a larger video than that of the given limit on a video it just rejects it. On iOS whatsapp gives you a little function that u can just cut the video into segments and send them in separate messages? This sounds like it can be something that is on the app level. I dont know but as for end user experience its just not convenient you need to download another app that will cut videos in segments for you this is retarded. 5. battery life just sucks on android – and my friend is all like well it works for me…well that’s because he had to buy a new battery that was double the size and totally threw out the idea of having a sleek thin phone. Theres on and on the list goes android and samsung devices are not superior devices. The features samsung lovers speak of are just gimmicks. Keyboards, widgets, notifications honestly who cares? Especially when widgets just take down performance on your phone? I just dont see any benefits on android especially the argument went something like this: “oh android phones are cheaper for superior hardware” Like I said hardware maybe superior on PAPER but in real life benchmarks iphones outshine samsung and htc and other top tier android devices. By the way prices are not cheaper anymore so android fanboys have no actual argument. Like I said I tried android and they are not superior phones both hardware and software. Aesthetically Android phones are ugly. You now pay a premium price on sub premium products, and they explode. lol 10/20/2016 Jamezz_ Reply Sure. A Samsung or LG’s phone software is ugly. But stock android?! Android 6.0 stock? It’s an extraordinary interface with origami-style apps. The geometry with the shadows and vibrant colors is beautiful. The app drawer is simple, and you can put the apps you use on your home screen. Android’s advantage is software. iSheep are just too autistic to use it. 10/16/2016 Cmi Reply I have both!

Anybody who argues this point has never used them side by side. No comparison.anybody who stands in line for the new iPhone is absolutely getting the shaft and not even getting the best product , it’s laughable! 10/18/2016 George Brite Reply Great article. Over the years I’ve had both. Even a couple of Macs. I use PC’s now because I like being able to work on them and build my own. For the average user the I Phone is a better choice. They are simple and work well. Here’s the big negatives for me: The hardware and software are proprietary. In fact the phones are sealed. You can’t install an extended battery. No SD slot. No root access. Comparable Android phones cost a lot less. The Android phones natively work with Google Apps. We use our phones in the business. If I were a casual user it wouldn’t matter if it were a Trac Phone or an I Phone. We use the Google phones and Motorola phones. They run pure Android without all the carrier bloatware. I like to say Apple invented the smartphone, but Google perfected it. It’s like the choice between a toaster oven and a microwave or a full commercial kitchen. Most people will get along fine with the toaster and microwave. They don’t need a commercial kitchen. But, what if you could get the full commercial kitchen for the same price as the toaster and microwave? Everyone has an opinion about which is better. But trust me when I say this isn’t a choice between chocolate and vanilla. There are very distinct differences between the Android and Apple phones. 10/21/2016 ZinicHD Reply Wtf, apps never ever releases on iOS first. It always releases on android first. Also app updates releases on android first, so that’s kind of bullshit what you are saying. The only thing iOS beats android in is security and stability. Also you can get virus scanners on android, so that thing doesn’t matter. And one thing more, who ever uses FaceTime or iMessage, when we have messenger, Skype ect… And that point when you said that iOS stock apps was the stupidest crap I have ever heard. First of all it was a shit point, what are you gonna need the looks for? Second is that not everyone thinks it look better, so keep that mind. I am a iOS user and I am so disappointed that you can’t even customize the most of the things. I have to admit that the design of iOS is pretty nice, but you get quick tired of it. That’s why I jailbreaked my device to get the ability to customize it more professionally. But I don’t compare a android device and a jailbroken device, because jailbreaking is not something that comes with Apple. iOS is also very expensive compared to android devices. And checking storage on android is way more organized than iOS, so I don’t know where you get that idea that checking storage on iOS is better. 10/22/2016 Bent Vanwijnsberghe Reply the lightning port part is bs i have an iphone (looking for a new phone android) and there are around me on my desk already 3 micro usb and 1 lightning port witch costs around 40 bucks for a new one 10/25/2016 Selenia Reply Terrible article by an obvious fanboy. You are listing many things, like lack of carrier or manufacturer bloatware, reversible charging plug, seamless sharing, etc and saying they are exclusive to Apple. Try Googling USB-C, the current standard on any higher range Android, some still cheaper than an iDevice. Try a Nexus, or as of this year, Pixel phone. No bloat, Android as Google intended it. That would be a more fair comparison as those are at least close in the chain to Google, like an iPhone is to Apple. That is, instead of being made by some company who may not even care how it represents Android, build quality, and other important things, instead of pure profit(not say all non Nexus/Pixel phones are bad by any means, but some do give Android a bad name with poor specs and modified/outdated versions of Android). Seamless sharing? Ever hear of WiFi Direct, Bluetooth, or NFC? NFC is the simplest. Just hit share and tap. All but the cheapest Androids have that these days. Anyways, I am convinced you have never used a decent Android, ever. Certainly not one from Google themselves. I will leave you to tend to your iFlock. 10/30/2016 MzJens Reply For android, I think google products like nexus & pixel are much better than samsung. However, I noticed a lot of crappy apps available on google play that doesn’t work. Some apps require root access which only advance users should do. Android interface is not as intuitive as iOS. Some android apps hang. I’ve never had ios apps hang on me 11/10/2016 Pixleboy2 Reply “You have to try multiple attempts before putting the charger in at the right angle” 1. If you do it in a lit environment you will get it in first try because the micro USB shape is easy to see 2. If you are in the dark: And have an official Samsung charger – there will be a “bumps letting you know which way to put it and the only thing that can go wrong is you missing the port, which is possible on iPhone too. And have any old micro USB – there are two, normal, ways to insert it horizontally upside down and horizontally the correct way both 180 degree angles so please don’t exaggerate it. Finally Samsung cares about you that’s why they use micro USB. This may seem weird but basically to legally make a lightning USB cable you need a licence from Apple and Apple only have their own unique charger to earn more profit, that’s why apple chargers are always more expensive, because they are sold by Apple or the retailer needs to make his money back from the licence fare. P.S. Samsung devices come with a 1 year warranty for free and because it’s Samsung you can get cheaper insurance than their one (yes they have one) P.P.S. Sharing has always been easier on android to anything because you could share with a variety of options such as Bluetooth, NFC, messaging app, other third party apps, S share (Samsung own “air drop” that came out in Android version 4.1.3 BI7 – before Ios 7 Also the settings icon is useful, it’s like apple not making the send button on messages 3d touch to send so you don’t accidently press it, sure sometimes you send half written messages but it is more convenient and normal to have it to a single normal touch. And there is a difference between apps looking better and having more features on Apple which are usually hardware based, I just brought this up because no matter who you ask if you compare a Samsung phone with its equivalent iPhone generation, Samsung phones ALWAYS have better displays and MOSTLY have better cameras. Samsung phones are also very comfortable, for example I am writing this on a Samsung galaxy s7 edge There is a setting that allows the micro sd card to be added as side by side storage Finally Samsung has always had earphone controls so either I read it wrong that you said these are things we will miss very much or you are really confused 11/12/2016 Tetsuokenpachi Reply Each and every single of these are false. Android is actually better in every single of these areas. From the first to the last one.

Classic hurt points being in iphone /iOS being No expandable memory No dual sim version (i travel internationally and need this frequently) Unable to use lastpass like apps the same way as in android (and keychain is BS, BTW) Simple things like themes unavailable Very less system wide control Very limited customisation I can go on but i think unless my expensive edge can give me same performance as now for ATLEAST 2 years, i’ll eat my words back But, the 15 points mentioned here are almost all very unconvincing. 11/17/2016 Philip Reply Apple are just simple phones no really fancy stuff I have had two Android phone I love their features but not their battery life which is crappie I have had two Apple iPods and two iPhone they were the 4 32 GB & 5s 64 GB now on Android your apps get updated every 3 months on Apple sometimes twice a week IOS updates are twice month at least I bought my iPhone 5s 64 GB which started with iOS 7 in 2014 now it got iOS 10.1.1 it seems the IOS are getting worse not better it freezes crashes most apps lot of the app you can’t even post two year let alone one day old photo I can get on my Samsung Galaxy S3 with 3 year old photos on it and post photos off it to any app only reason I like the small iPhones I can collect lot photos that way I can post to my apps like now I got over 106K photos on my 5s 64 GB which you can’t do with big phones only problems I got with iPhones are updates on apps and IOS’S like this month iOS 10.2 supposedly be coming out it seems the new IOS’s don’t really fixing any problems you get on your iPhone it just give you different problems while you still have the same old problems you also got figure Apple iPhones are about 3 years behind Android phones on new ideals 11/18/2016 Nick Reply Apple!?

You are writing about malware crap which is misleading. New android versions since lollipop allow users to modify app permissions but i think you are so caught up in app constrained ecosystem, you didn’t noticed. IOS isn’t secure anymore as we thought it was. Su vulnerability has already been fixed and there is no more stagefright bug in android. And you obviously have no idea about the difference between android based phones and android phones. Most of the Phones from samsung, htc, sony etc run Custom Android based OS, They are actually custom build port of android, not real android phones, so obviously there will be some issues too if you try to port IOS on samsung. A high end smartphone can go head to head with iphone in each and every aspect. My s6 edge is not even a tad slower than iphone 6, in fact, it performs even better. The slowdown overtime can be experience on low end smartphone. Obviously the one writing this comment has no idea about fstrim. Stop posting such nonsense crap in order to get traffic to your website. 11/25/2016 ashford Reply I have never once had a problem with android phones, but decided to switch it up as IPhones are the ‘in thing’ It was okay for a few months, but soon started having plenty of issues with speed, memory and doing basic things. I decided to upgrade it to the 7, which turned out to be just as bad. For the price, they should be giving people something amazing, not mediocrity! P.S. How much did they apple pay you for such a bad article. 12/03/2016 Brandon McLean Reply You didn’t mention how Apple has a much smaller battery, late software updates, unneeded restrictions, is insanely overpriced, and most of all, Apples processor specs come in at a fraction of what Androids of the same price have, AKA 1.6 GHZ (Apple iPhones) vs 2.4 GHZ (ASUS, Galaxy S7, OnePlus all running Android), 2 GB of RAM (Apple) vs 4 GB of RAM (Android). Android is by far the superior technology. Your only argument is that Android uses Google’s superior sharing system, rather than their own like Apple does. 12/14/2016 Keith Llewellyn Reply For me, it’s all about security, and Apple has the best. Also, if you buy an iPhone you get updates and support for a couple of years more than Google provides for it’s own Nexus or Pixel phones. Two years worth of updates for the OS and Three years for security updates FROM THE DATE OF FIRST INTRODUCTION is totally inadequate. It means that you have to buy a new google phone from the date it is first available in order to really benefit from the updates. 12/27/2016 Apple Marketing Machine Reply Let’s compare the “core” features of a new iphone to a 2 year old android phone: iphone 7 plus – Released 2016, September Samsung Galaxy Note 4 – Released 2014, October iphone 7 plus – 1080 x 1920 pixels (~401 ppi pixel density) Samsung Galaxy Note 4 – 1440 x 2560 pixels (~518 ppi pixel density) iphone 7 plus – Quad-core 2.23 GHz Samsung Galaxy Note 4 – Quad-core 2.7 GHz iphone 7 plus – 12 MP camera Samsung Galaxy Note 4 – 16 MP camera iphone 7 plus – Non-removable Li-Ion 2900 mAh battery Samsung Galaxy Note 4 – Removable Li-Ion 3220 mAh battery okay…you can have your “better looking apps”. 12/28/2016 MACKabiVIPer42 Reply Yes Android phones are better everything wise but iPhone battery is better last as long as up to 3 to 4 years Samsung last up to 6 months I know had S3 and HTC 1 still got S3 3rd battery it’s just iPod on second iPhone first one was iPhone 4 32 GB lasted 4 years got iPhone 5s 64 GB it’s over 2 yrs old but don’t use for taking photos just for collecting photos which small iPhone can collect up too 100K photos like my iPhone 5s I’m not SELFIE PERSON where I got take photo of my self in every window mirror and bathroom I love stealing other people photos like Anime ladies in bikinis to post on my other apps even Animals if they are cute enough yes Apple do make there apps crappie and there IOS’s also which crashes and freezes a lot then half time you can’t post photos or articles from your e-mail too the apps but I take Apple for small phone over android big phone 03/06/2017 iAlex Reply More pixels require more energy and chip performance. To human eye it looks the same screen. It’s same as you put truck engine in a car for same volume of fuel. Do you really need that for your serious business tasks? Kids need that for games only… 12/27/2016 Bas Reply This brought my iq down by 10 points, iphone users aren’t bothered by that because they dont have any iq points to lose. This list is pure “i don’t like it so that means android is bad” and “its apple so whatever it does it’s genius”. if you’ve ever ACTUALLY went from crapple to android (unlike 99% of the comments here that say they have but in reality… well) you would notice a LOT of improvements over crapple. 1: The price to quality ratio is MUCH better that apple’s. 2: More customisation options. Unless you count changing your phone cover as “customizing”. 3: It’s not apple, so it’s better (see what i did there? I did the shit apple fanboy’s do) 4: No dumb “inovations”. 5: Simplifying things and making something that takes 3 seconds isn’t better, Sony, Samsung etc focus on more important things to improve. 03/06/2017 iAlex Reply Well you sound like Forest Gump in his movie when he said that his friend opened Apple company for selling fruits…. You don’t know what Apple is…. 12/30/2016 Joe Reply iPhones are more compatible with other devices if you have an iPad and Mac. But if you’re like majority of people and have a Windows computer that’s a lie. I installed iTunes once and my computer was never the same again. It was slower and crashed more often untill I uninstalled it. With Android you don’t have to install anything to put music on your phone. 01/02/2017 Dusty72 Reply This post is really interesting, but why it is on 15th place in google’s search results.

Simply search for: pandatsor’s tools 01/03/2017 Marcelino Reply I’d have to say if you think the last iPhone was 2 years ago then you know nothing about it. I have a android galaxy tab 3 and the iPod 6 generation and if I was to choose which is better it’s definitely Apples product and I never would get an android again. When I got my android new at Walmart it couldn’t even get the latest version, it was completely unbelievable. After I had it for 3 months it slowed down on me and its battery life is horrible. Now when I bought this IPod new I’ve had it for a double the time now and it works like new and best of all it can get the latest version. The quality of Apple is way better. In my opinion the iPhone is the best visual quality I’ve seen yet. Ive done some decent gaming on them and if you want something to save your progress then forget android, because not all the game link to your google play account so if you reset it the ones that don’t link are gone. Unlike apple I haven’t had any issues with it. I’ve lost decent money and progress on android because of it. Yes Apple does come out with the newest technology a bit latter then android but you can see it it a good way or a bad. The bad way would be that their slow, the good way you can see it as if their watching googles failing parts and their making it better. 01/03/2017 Marcelino Reply Also I can see you all are fighting over this topic which is pretty stupid. To be honest you can’t necessarily compare them. Everyone is different so everyone is going to want something different. If we all wanted android or we all wanted Apple we would become robots. If you wanted to find a phone to get then get into inside detail to see what your looking for. If you wanted fun texting and want to be more secure then go straight for apple because they got the best for that but if you wanted fun lock screens or be able to put micro SD cards and changeable batteries then go for android but let me remind you that anyone can take the SD card out and take your information. Hope this helps. 01/04/2017 LOREN FOK Reply people will buy iphone just because thats what everyone else has they dont even know what they are buying. They think because its popular its the best choice..all robots who don’t think for themselves 03/06/2017 iAlex Reply Since it’s more popular it’s better … 01/04/2017 farafit Reply i read almost every comments and keep deciding what should i buy: an android or iphone. i own android for 8 years now (from the era when sony ericsson still existed) and got so accustomed to it. i changed devices for 4 times during the 8 years because i want to get spec updates regularly. i love the fact that it is very simple in android: you can buy any android device you want and you will feel like you never changed your phone. contact, picture, apps, music will all still be the same as in the old phone. i heard that iphone is more stable compared to android so i am thinking of switching but i am genuinely scared the switch will cost me more: i will have to buy new headphones, mac (because many say that iphones does not connect well with pc), and i am very clumsy so i’m scared of scattering my iphone screen and will need to pay more to repair it. my husband owns a 4s and it still works until now, and it is true that android has shorter lifespan for a clumsy user like me because after some point android will keep hanging.. but still i think android is perfect for people like me who doesn’t really have the money to be a vivid apple follower.. i don’t want to be all attached to itunes.. i dont want to be obliged to buy a macbook to operate my iphone well.. i just don’t really like to spend almost all of my earnings to buy a single phone, when at the same time the same amount of money can be used to buy an android and a pc, and a vacuum cleaner.. maybe someday i will switch to apple products altogether when i have a mountain pile of money to spend.. but for now i am quite happy with a middle-end android phone and will stick to it.. 03/06/2017 iAlex Reply As they say: expensive shoes last longer… 01/10/2017 Frank McConnell Reply iPhones are better than androids, PERIOD.

Most of the alleged superiorities are interoperabilty between iPhones (iMessage, Airdrop) or between iPhone and other Apple devices (Handoff) – if you are a PC owner, or have a large number of friends or fellow users on Android, these advantages are insignificant at best. I will concede that updates and lack of carrier bloatware are significant pluses, the author is doing an extreme disservice to new users by basically promoting an iPhone prejudice. 01/31/2017 Matt Perkins Reply iPhones win over Android smartphones for these 5 critical reasons. Security, Privacy, Stability, Performance and Usability. iOS gets far less malware than Android, it has far less critical vulnerabilities than Android. Vulnerabilities are patched quicker in iOS. iOS crashes and freezes less than Android, Apple doesn’t harvest data to sell like Google does (Google has even started collecting identifiable data since they released their new voice assistant). iOS is a faster OS than Android is while Android smartphones slow down faster than the iPhone does. And of course iOS offers the better out of box experience. Not to mention you can never make Android as secure as iOS, only close to as secure. Part of the reason is even if you tweak your Android settings to be similar to iOS, the official Google Play Store gets far more malware than the AppStore and Cydia combined. So only way to even remotely match it is not download apps or games. My other favorite part of iOS over Android is the fact you can use true adblockers in iOS, not just adblock browsers without the need to root or jailbreak. Google will never allow you to block ads in Chrome or block all ads third party ads without rooting. And as you knowing rooting and jailbreaking merely lowers the security of the OS. That’s another thing Jailbroken iOS is more secure than untouched Android as long as you stick to the default repos in Cydia. 02/01/2017 Shaun Anderson Reply Android Download from unknown sources like a regular computer Download files from browser Plug in and transfer anything to and from computer. File System. Just acts more like a computer in regards to freedom to do as you will where iPhone is locked down like a game system. 03/06/2017 iAlex Reply You can do all that in iTunes. iPhone is more careful to protect data while android is less careful.

Who really cares if the poor sods on the other side of the world live the lives of slaves? Who cares if they have to stand ALL day, and ASK for pissbreaks? Who cares if the companies solution to suicides are suicide nets around buildings and removing knives? Who cares if the iphone costs a dollar to make, but sold for $600? Who cares if most of the jobs are not in the countries paying for the status symbols? So lets be clear, its all about “im better than you because i can waste money on bling, and *&$! your community at the same time”. 02/18/2017 exycheezy Reply I’ve had both. many times. I’ve had every version of the iPhone. I’ve never had an Android phone update properly. My 3 year old plays on my old 2nd gen iPhone that has the latest IOS on it. . .. android can’t do that. with the exception of a Verizon flip phone, every single Android phone I’ve ever had got a virus, crashed and I had to reset to factory settings at least 2 times per phone. I have never, ever ever got a virus on ANY Apple product, and never had to put any software or app to keep it running correctly. As far as customization? Who cares. If you’re so busy and have so much time to waste trying to impress everyone with crazy fonts and wild customization, the iPhone is way to sleek, sophisticated and user -friendly for you. Software dictates hardware. The IOS blows Android OS away. And, any (anyone who’s actually worked on both will agree) Apple product gets sometimes twice the speed out of less RAM and processing than ANY other OS (Windows or Android). Give me stability anytime. so your phone has an expandable memory? What good is it when it won’t run half the time. Have a nice day all. . .. .after all, they’re just phones. . .. right? 02/19/2017 Richie Reply Some things to add (pros and cons) as a PC & Android guy that just switched to iPhone (but I’m staying on PC): 1) The iOS versions of Microsoft apps are better than the Android ones and they work great. 2) Article is correct: the iOS versions of apps are generally better than their Android counterparts, in ways you will notice. It’s really kind of a shame for Android – I don’t get why they don’t just match the exact app. 3) Lightning is neat but I found MicroUSB more useful, since it’s used for more devices, i.e. I have a MicroUSB running from my desk to my PC to charge my wireless mouse, and then I would also use it to charge my phone sometimes. 4) Yes I do miss customization heaven with Android, but this iPhone runs like total butter. Android runs WELL but this thing is so zippy and responsive – you wouldn’t believe it until you spent time with one. 5) ALSO customization isn’t as cut-off as it used to be with iOS. Some apps can latch onto some functions in the phone, kinda like installing an extension for your desktop browser. It’s something. Really I just bought an iPhone to “try something new” and I’m really liking it. 02/28/2017 Toby Reply Just do a Quick google search iphone is less reliable than Android, theres your Answer in the studies.

Also to feel the power and beauty of technology in your hand. How I wished that Isaac Newton or Ainstein or Nikola Tessa or… would see what we have today… Second: iPhone is far more serious for people who want job to be done as fast and simpler way without delays. Android phones are for kids who like customizations and pretty colors and to look like iron man or similar… Third: iPhone is made of better materials. And looks for business high class. Android phones are copying iPhone’s look especially Samsung. Fourth: iPhone technology, the software and hardware gives you exactly what you need. No more no less. Android technologies gives you extra things which are seldom used and are simply extra using more battery and device performance. Fifth: iPhone has a specific style in design. Keeping updating same style to better one making it each time better and better. Sixth: Applications on iPhone are much better with much less defects than Android. At the end, I had various Samsung, Sony, Huawei, Htc and iPhone phones. I choose iPhone. Now I have iPhone 6s+ black limited edition with golden Apple. It’s very nice piece of equipment. at the bottom line, Apollo 11 travelled to the moon using Fortan on its 360 kb computer. Today we are talking of gigs bytes.

Me and my brother just finished reading this article and were laughing hysterically through every single reason. My guess is that you’re a loyal iPhone fanatic who tried an Android phone for a week and didn’t understand it. You even used some funny tactics to make the iPhone look better in every photo, like using a small Galaxy model next to a large iPhone, with iPhone on full brightness and the Android one at around half. That’s a little sleazy. First of all, you said iPhone apps update sooner and are pretty. That was true MANY years ago before Android was the dominant OS. The reverse is usually true, as most developers prioritize on Android because more people use it. ‘Fast iPhone updates for all…’ For one thing, the same is true on newer Android phones, which constantly receive updates just like iPhones. Sure, older Android phones no longer receive the newest updates… but neither do old iPhones. Does anyone here have an iPhone 4 running ios 10? I thought so. Also, major ios updates tend to make the soon-to-be obsolete iPhone model so slow that it’s unusable. It’s happened to me and others I know, to the iPhone 4 and the 5… and soon to the 6, so they can force you to upgrade to the newest polished turd they churn out. The next one made me laugh so hard that I got sharp pains in my stomach. Thanks for that. “Works great with all your devices” Sure, IF YOU HAVE ALL APPLE DEVICES, just like my Windows Phone works great with my Windows PC. Android works well with Windows, and Linux, and… everything else, except Apple’s computers. In fact, no Apple device can integrate with anything other than another Apple device. It’s just a circular logic-sustained monopoly. If you’ve fallen for it, good for you, but don’t try to use such non-logic to persuade others. The article argues that Android’s inclusion of carrier bundled apps depending on the manufacturer makes it inferior. Most people don’t like the carrier apps, but guess what, you can uninstall them or not use them. You couldn’t, however, uninstall Apple’s bundled apps until very recently. The only apps on Android you cannot uninstall are the system apps. The article then point’s out Apple’s iPhone warranty. What’s funny is… You can get the same with many Android manufacturers, but you can also choose not to. After all, a warranty, like any other insurance business model, makes responsible users who do not break their phones subsidize those who do break their phones. The ‘sharing to other iPhones’… Just like you can share to other Android phones on your Android phone, not to mention the fact that Android’s sharing options are more extensive and easier to use. So, that’s a downside on Apple’s part:] “Worth more when you resell” This was another wildly hilarious one. Can you guess why iPhones resell at a higher value? It’s because they’re more expensive in the first place! Higher resell value is just a not-so-clever way of spinning the fact that iPhones are extremely expensive. Again, a downside on the iPhone’s part. Lightning miles better than Micro USB? First of all, an entirely subjective statement. The Lightning cord was unpopular for a reason. It’s just a way for Apple to make more money, forcing people to throw away their old cables and buy new ones. That’s just crappy business. Also, I personally think Micro USB is much better, because they’re very versatile and widely used, and are compatible with ANYTHING else USB. Like the mighty kraken, Apple has a way of grabbing you and pulling you into their ecosystem, choking you to death by consistently overcharging you for mediocre hardware. Apple stores for support? You mean like the equivalent support you can get from most Android phone manufacturers, MINUS the cheap rates and competition? That sounds FAR superior! The next argument is over ‘ease of use’. First of all, most/all functions common to both operating systems are performed just as easily on Android. The ease of use argument only exists because some of the things you can do on Android, but not iPhone, can be difficult. Because the fact is, Android is so much more customize-able. You can install new themes, you can use file managers, you can manually install app packages, and much, much more. Some of these things take learning, but at least you can do them in the first place. If you just want an Android to use as a phone, you can do so just as easily. Ease of use is just another way of saying you cannot do anything advanced on IOS. “HEADPHONE CONTROLS!” Newsflash: they work on Android too. It’s fully supported on every Android device I’ve tried, and i’ve tried some really old ones. ‘iMessage, FaceTime and FaceTime Audio’ There are good, equivalent services on Android. Better control of notification? The way they are handled on Android is quite similar, and different types of notification ARE separated on Android, so I don’t know what you’re trying to say there. Storage use and carrier options: It’s funny that the author uses ‘choice’ as one of his arguments. You can get most/all of the same options plus more on Android. It’s also funny how you decided to name Andoid’s common acceptance of SD cards a negative. You wrote that you can move some but not all apps to the SD card as a negative. Obviously, because you should not be able to move essential system apps to an external device. At least you can choose external storage in most Android phones, which cannot be done on a one size fits all iPhone. This post was pathetic, mostly because every single argument is a non-argument, or reflects negatively on iPhones. It does provide a good laugh, though.

The Apple store in San Francisco. (Foster + Partners Photo) As Apple builds out a new store in Seattle’s University Village Mall, the company is gearing up to revamp its top stores around the world. Angela Ahrendts, Apple’s senior vice president of retail and leader of the redesign projects, appeared on CBS This Morning Tuesday and outlined the changes coming to Apple’s top 100 stores around the world. She described the architecture of the store itself as the hardware, and what happens inside as software. Many aspects of the redesign carry over from changes to Apple’s flagship San Francisco store unveiled last year. The two-story store features 42-by-40-foot sliding glass doors that allow the store to become part of the outdoor space. Changes at stores will include new screens, trees and other landscaping and spaces set aside for meetings and classes. The famous Genius Bar is getting a makeover as well. It will be called Genius Grove, and it will have staffers specializing in things like music and photography. Apple announced this morning plans to launch dozens of new educational sessions in May in all 495 Apple stores ranging in topics from photo and video to music, coding, art and design and more. The programs, known as “Today at Apple,” will in some cities feature well-known artists, photographers and musicians, teaching sessions from basics and how-to lessons to professional-level classes.

(GeekWire Photo / Nat Levy) The redesign and new educational programs aim to make Apple stores more welcoming and appealing to a broader set of customers. “We’re creating a modern-day town square, where everyone is welcome in a space where the best of Apple comes together to connect with one another, discover a new passion, or take their skill to the next level,” Ahrendts said. GeekWire recently uncovered permit documents indicating a new Apple store is going up in Seattle’s University Village mall. The blueprints show several of these new concepts included in the redesign, including trees in the store and meeting spaces. An architect listed on documents for the Seattle project — Foster + Partners — designed the San Francisco location. Apple opened the University Village location in 2003, approximately two years after the company opened its first brick and mortar locations. In 2011, Apple revamped the store, though it stayed the same size.

The feature is deemed to be quite convenient as one needs not fiddle with clumsy cabling in order to charge a phone. When iPhone users got wind of the technology, they too, wanted a slice of the action. Now, while experts have speculated that the iPhone 7s, 7s Plus, and the tenth anniversary iPhone will have wireless charging, a CEO of a known wireless charging provider has finally confirmed the initial rumors. According to Powermat CEO Elad Dubzinski, wireless charging will be a standard feature among all iPhones released this year. The CEO shared the sentiment in a recent news release from the company. Unfortunately, the press release did not clarify whether Powermat will be providing the wireless charging solution for Apple. For now, it is still uncertain which company will provide the wireless charging solution to Apple. Earlier reports suggest that either Qi and Energous are on the list of possible suppliers. Furthermore, we also cannot confirm if there is truth in Dubzinski’s pronouncement as it did not come directly from Apple. Powermat wireless charger (via amazon.com) Nevertheless, since most market pundits have been speculating that at least one of the iPhones to be released this year will have wireless charging, perhaps that is enough. Whether or not Apple includes wireless charging to the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus, it is still too soon to tell. Besides, at the moment, Apple is still in a bit of a turmoil based on recent reports about the company. According to recent updates, the company is planning on pushing the production of the iPhone until much later due to supplier concerns. Apparently, Samsung is experiencing difficulties fulfilling Apple’s design requirements for the iPhone 8’s OLED display. Also, a number of Apple suppliers are still scrambling to meet production deadlines for the upcoming tenth anniversary iPhone. As with any information regarding the upcoming iPhone models, this too should be taken with a grain of salt. For more tech updates, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

It has created or helped push creation of new technologies to further its growth. Now, its efforts to become more self-reliant is starting to take shape starting with the micro-LED display. According to Business Korea, market watchers are warning companies like Samsung and LG as Apple advances on its micro-LED design efforts. As stated in the said article, Apple is now ready to mass produce the said display for use on the Apple Watch Series 3 by the end of the year. While Apple’s smartwatch market share is still not quite significant, companies like LG is said to lose more than $200 million in revenue if Apple uses the micro-LED. This is due to the fact that at the moment, the OLED displays used on the current and older generation Apple Watches are manufactured by LG. Apple Watch (via apple.com) Another company that is also under threat is Samsung. Currently, the company supplies all the OLED display for the iPhone 8. While the yield for bigger sized micro-LEDs are still low, it is only a matter of time before Apple makes the necessary manufacturing improvements. When that happens, Samsung could potentially lose billions of dollars in revenue from Apple alone. Apple began its efforts on micro-LED research back in 2015 when it acquired LuxVue. At the time, the display technology is still very new and not a lot of companies know about it. Also, during the early days of the research, most of the efforts were given to improving production yield as this type of display is quite difficult to manufacture. Nevertheless, it seems that all the hard work is finally paying off. Micro-LED, to those unaware, is the newest type of display technology in the market. It offers better image quality and clarity than a conventional OLED or LCD panel. It also boasts longer lifespan than an OLED as well as being brighter. However, due to its complexity, it is still a bit expensive to mass produce. For more tech updates, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

Gaming News PS4 Xbox One Nintendo PC Gaming Mobile Gaming What’s Hot Rumour Gameplay Guide Patch Tech News Mobile Tablet Desktop OS Tech Rumors Trending Anime Movies TV Series Entertainment Sports Social Media World News Contact Us The Bitbag Gaming News PS4 Xbox One Nintendo PC Gaming Mobile Gaming What’s Hot Rumors Gameplay Guide Patch Tech News Mobile Tablet Desktop OS Tech Rumors Trending Anime Movies TV Series Entertainment Sports Social Media World News Reviews iPhone iPhone 8 Updates: Release Date, New Pricing, and More By Kiko Antonio https://twitter.com/kikoTBB on April 26, 2017 11:24 AM It seems like every day that passes increases the risk of anyone hearing anything ridiculous about the iPhone. Yesterday, Ming-Chi Kuo speculated that Apple might push the production of the tenth anniversary iPhone by two months. Now, a somewhat questionable report seems to suggest that Apple might ditch the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus altogether in favor of the iPhone 8. Rumored iPhone 8 models According to a report from Chinese tech blog MicGadget, supply chain sources linked with Foxconn are saying the company has received orders from Apple for two iPhone models. What is more interesting, these orders are not for the iPhone 7 upgrade. Instead, the alleged orders are for two models of iPhone 8. For months now, market experts have been saying that Apple will not be able to release a complete range of iPhones carrying an OLED display. This is mainly due to the fact that as of now, there is a global shortage for the display and will further increase next year and the year after that. That is why it is somewhat ludicrous to think that Apple will be releasing two iPhone 8 models, both with OLED displays as the supply chain will not permit it to be. There is a chance that the website might have misunderstood that information given to it. It is possible that the orders are for both the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus instead of two iPhone 8 models. iPhone 8 concept (via idropnews.com) New iPhone 8 pricing There have been a lot of reports saying that the iPhone 8 will cost somewhere north of $1,000. This is due to the new hardware updates that Apple is putting into the phone. However, an analyst from Morgan Stanley says the phone will be somewhere around $750 when released. The reasoning behind this is that Apple will use the iPhone 8 as a leverage so people will more likely upgrade to the new phone when it comes out. Also, the firm believes that the iPhone 8 will generate more sales just like the trend Apple is having with the iPhone 7 Plus. On the other hand, analysts from Longbow Research claims that due to Apple’s ever increasing expenditure, the iPhone 8 will still have a slightly premium price. Although, the report claims, it will not go beyond the $1,000 mark like initially predicted. Instead, consumers could be looking at an iPhone 8 priced around $850. It should be noted though that this price is still higher than the Samsung Galaxy S8 which is priced at $720. iPhone 8 release date At the moment, the general consensus is that Apple might not launch the iPhone 8 in September. Instead, Apple might need a bit more time sorting out supply bottlenecks as well as manufacturing issues. Yesterday, known market analyst Ming-Chi Kuo from KGI Securities speculated that Apple might push the production of the iPhone by two months. Instead of initial reports of August or September production, it will now be done in October or November. This delay in production could potentially delay the official release of the iPhone 8 until early next year. Alleged iPhone 8 dummy by Benjamin Geskin On the other hand, Nikkei seems to think that Apple might still be able to release the said smartphone this year; with October seen as the earlier possible release date. The Nikkei somehow contradicts Kuo’s earlier prediction and builds on the report by IHS Market saying Apple will start production of the iPhone 8 in July. According to the IHS Market report, Samsung is still having issues manufacturing the displays that Apple wanted. The display maker originally planned to start production of the display in May. However, due to manufacturing difficulties, it was now pushed by two months. Once again, readers should note that these are nothing but speculations made by experts in the field. They are, in no way, accurate and should not be used as a basis of facts. However, it should also be noted that some of the speculations, especially the ones made by Kuo, are somewhat reliable if not totally correct at best. Nonetheless, these pronouncements should still be taken with a grain of salt. For more updates on the iPhone 8, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

According to a report by The Economic Times, such a levy is expected to take the prices of smartphones up by 5 - 10%. The government is hoping to roll out the GST tax reform which aims to subsume majority of the indirect taxes and replace them with a uniform tax structure in the country, by July 1, 2017. The move will give a boost to local manufacturing, encourage companies like Apple to make in India, and keep Chinese companies at bay, the report said. According to it, an inter-ministerial committee with representatives of the finance, telecom, IT, and commerce ministries have been set up to examine the issue in detail. At the same time, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley proposed the removal of countervailing duty on electronic components imported from overseas which would also help local manufacturing as input cost would come down. Several smartphone companies have set up assembling units in the country on the back of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Make in India program. According to a report by The Hindustan Times, "The value of mobile phones assembled in India has increased 373% in the last two years fro, Rs 19,000 crore in 2014-15 to over Rs 90,000 crore in 2016-17 About 40 mobile phone making plants have started since Modi announced Make in India in September 2014. These plants manufacture 20 million phones every month." Lenovo, Huawei, Motorola, all assemble their phones in the country. While the government has been urging Apple to make its smartphones in the country, the Cupertino-bsaed company is looking for several tax concessions from the government to set up a manufacturing unit here. As it stands, Union IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad is slated to meet Apple's officials to discuss the plans soon. "A lot of big mobile phone manufacturing companies have come, and if Apple comes fine, they are welcome," he said recently. He added, "They (Apple) are very keen. Its executives are going to meet me in a coule of days." Prasad said 72 global telecom firms had started production in the country over the last two years.

The iOS 10.3.1 update for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch is now available and today we want to walk you through the most important things to know as we push away from today’s release. Apple recently released two new versions of iOS 10.3. One version, iOS 10.3.2, is an unreleased bug fixer that’s in beta testing ahead of an unknown release date. The other version, iOS 10.3.1, is a small maintenance release for the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. iOS 10.3.1 is available right now for all iPhone, iPad and iPod touch models capable of running Apple’s iOS 10 operating system. While it’s not as big as its predecessor (iOS 10.3), iOS 10.3.1 is still an important release. It comes with a security patch and some bug fixes and it could also have a dramatic effect on your device’s overall performance. With that in mind, we want to walk you through the most important things to know, right now, about iOS 10.3.1. iOS 10.3.1 Review: Should You Install? The iOS 10.3.1 update is tiny if you’re coming directly from iOS 10.3. On the iPhone 7, you can expect a 30MB download. We were able to finish up the the download in a matter of seconds though the installation process took about 5 minutes to complete on our phone. We recommend putting aside 10 minutes or so to monitor the situation. Our installation went smoothly but there’s no telling what you might encounter. If you’re coming to iOS 10.3.1 from something older than iOS 10.3 your iOS 10.3.1 update will be much larger thanks to iOS 10.3. iOS 10.3’s features and fixes will be baked into your update so make sure you put aside 30 minutes or so to monitor the installation. In the day since its release we’ve downloaded and installed the update on five versions of the iPhone: iPhone 7, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6, iPhone 5s, and iPhone 5. If you want some quick feedback, head to those links. We’ve also installed the software on four versions of the iPad including the iPad Air, iPad mini, and iPad Pro. Right now, iOS 10.3.1 is looking good. And given what’s on board (an important fix for a potential Wi-Fi exploit), it’s definitely worth a look if you own one of these devices. If you need more feedback about iOS 10.3.1 and its changes, take a look at our reasons to, and not to, install the iOS 10.3.1 update on your device right now. iOS 10.3.1: What’s New The iOS 10.3.1 change log states the update comes with bug fixes and security patches meaning it’s a maintenance update. Don’t expect any new features on board. Apple lists the iOS 10.3.1 update as having an single security patch. The update also reportedly fixes unnamed iPhone 5 and iPhone 5c issues. That said, if you’re coming to iOS 10.3.1 from iOS 10.2.1 or something older, you’ll get a bunch of new features with iOS 10.3.1 due to iOS 10.3. If you’re unfamiliar with iOS 10.3 we recommend taking a look at our walkthrough so that you can get familiar with its features before you install iOS 10.3.1 on your device. It’s also worth noting that Apple’s Clips application is finally out on the App Store for both the iPhone and iPad. Clips is available for select devices running iOS 10.3 or iOS 10.3.1. Clips isn’t available for the iPhone 5, iPhone 5c, or iPad 4. iOS 10.3.1 Problems It’s a small update but the iOS 10.3.1 update is causing problems for many iPhone, iPad and iPod touch users. iOS 10.3.1 users are complaining about battery drain, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, various first and third-party apps, lag, random reboots, and more. We expect complaints to pickup as more people find and discover the iOS 10.3.1 update lurking in Settings or on iTunes. If you’re seeing an issue after downloading the iOS 10.3.1 update, take a look at our list of fixes for the most common iOS 10 problems. You’ll also want to take a look at our tips to improve performance. You’ll also want to report any issues you see to Apple so that its engineers can get to work on a fix for the issue. Note: You can no longer downgrade from iOS 10.3.1 in an effort to fix performance issues. Apple’s no longer signing off on iOS 10.2.1 or iOS 10.3 which means you’re stuck on iOS 10.3.1 until the company rolls out a new update. iOS 10.3.1 Jailbreak If you’re jailbroken, skip the iOS 10.3.1 update for now. Jailbreak developers haven’t released a working jailbreak tool for iOS 10.2.1 or iOS 10.3 and we’re not expecting one for iOS 10.3.1 today or in the near future. For now, you must be on iOS 10.2 or something older to jailbreak an iPhone or an iPad. Unfortunately, there’s no way to downgrade to anything older than iOS 10.2.1. For more on the iOS 10 jailbreak, see our roundup. What’s Next With the iOS 10.3.1 release out of the way, Apple’s now focused on iOS 10.3.2, another maintenance update. Apple’s iOS 10.3.2 update is currently in beta for developers and the general public. We still don’t have a release date and we might not get one ahead of time. Apple typically doesn’t confirm iOS release dates ahead of time. While you might be tempted to try the iOS 10.3.2 update out ahead of its release, note that early software can and probably will cause problems on your device. For more on the merits of the iOS 10.3.2 beta, take a look at our walkthrough. 4 Reasons Not to Install iOS 10.3.1 & 9 Reasons You Should Install iOS 10.3.1 If You Want Better Security   1 / 13 If you value your security, you'll want to seriously consider downloading the iOS 10.3.1 update on your iPhone or iPad.  iOS 10.3.1 brings a single security patch for a potential Wi-Fi exploit. But if you failed to install iOS 10.3, your iOS 10.3.1 update will bring its monster list of patches as well.  The iOS 10.3 update delivered over 60 known patches for potential exploits. That's substantial, even for a milestone upgrade. The previous version of iOS 10, iOS 10.2.1, brought 14 known patches. Among them is a patch for a Safari ransomware bug that scammers used to extort iOS users who viewed pornography on their device.  These patches enhance the security on your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch making them ideal for those of you who store sensitive files/data on your device. Most people do. If you skipped the iOS 10.2.1 update and/or the iOS 10.2 update, know that iOS 10.3.1 brings their security patches with it as well. Again, the iOS 10.2.1 update had 14 important patches on board. You can see them all right here.  If you failed to install Apple's iOS 9.3.5 update, iOS 10.3.1 will also bring the three crucial security patches it delivered last year. These patch up serious security problems that could potentially expose your calls, contacts, texts, and emails. If security is important to you, iOS 10.3.1 is probably worth a download right now.   1 / 13 5 Responses 04/05/2017 H. Mitchell Reply I would like to see a fix for the recent calls listed on mutiple devices linked to the same apple id. Apple seems to store your call history ‘somewhere’ and my recent calls are displayed on my husband’s and daughter’s device (and vice versa). Apple has no business with my call history, this is private information and should only be accessible by my service provider and myself. Call history should not be linked via an apple id. 04/10/2017 Sebastian Reply DO NOT INSTALL THIS UPDATE! I have had several problems. I gave an iPhone 6s. 2 factor authentication did not work. When I got a hold of apple support they said to turn it off and wait for the next update. Worst part, my battery gets depleted very rapidly. Within 30 minutes my fully charged phone died! 04/14/2017 Thomas Meredith Reply Ever since I have done the update. My messaging system is saying waiting on activation. I can no longer message anyone. How do I fix this? 04/19/2017 Anand Reply I am unable to do the upgrade. Whenever I try (tried 20times so far) it goes up to “Verifying updates” and thereafter I receive a message “An error occurred while installing 10.3.1” with two options “Retry” and “Remind me later” I have followed all the instructions but unable to resolve this problem 04/25/2017 K Nelson Reply This update has messed up my email. I am not getting alerts and can not send email from my iPad. The email addresses do not appear to be a available to use. I email addresses are incorrect. Now. I use email to get my work assignments and not receiving them on time makes me miss work. And I can’t send emails from my addresses.

(WJHL) – A 12-year-old Bluff City Middle School student finally received the Apple Watch promised to her for her school fundraising efforts, but only after the school first sent her home with a generic smart watch. Knowing she needed to sell 30 items to score an Apple Watch, Chloe Ketron sold $500 worth of cookie dough and pizza as part of her recent school fundraiser. “I felt excited and proud that I had sold that much,” she said. “I was really hoping to get that Apple Watch. My mom had one and I really wanted one.” Her excitement quickly turned to frustration and sadness when it came time to open her reward. “I was really upset and disappointed,” she said. “I just saw that it looked nothing like an Apple Watch. I was just sort of angry. I knew my mom would be, because we both worked really hard and put a lot into this.” She said the generic watch given to her as her reward was incompatible with her iPhone and far less expensive than the more than $250 starting price for its Apple competitor. Chloe’s grandmother Judy Ayres said the situation made her feel “angry, disillusioned and disappointed.” “Chloe worked very hard on this,” she said. “It hurts. It hurts doubly when it’s your child or grandchild.” Chloe’s family says they called the district office and the middle school with concerns, but Sullivan County Director of Schools Evelyn Rafalowski said the principal first found out about the situation Monday, after WJHL started asking questions. “(The principal) states there was an oversight and a student was given a smart watch instead of an Apple watch,” she said in an email Monday. “The vendor is taking care of it and replacing the smart watch with an Apple watch.” Rafalowski said it’s her understanding five students were impacted. “Apple watches were being delivered today to the students,” Rafalowski said Tuesday. “(The principal) has found no one who received any report that a student received the wrong watch. This was an error which if had been brought to the attention of the administration would have been taken care of at that time.” “I’m glad they’re going to change that and they’re actually going to stick to their word,” Chloe said excitedly in response to the good news Monday afternoon. The sixth grade student received her watch Tuesday afternoon and is now proudly wearing it. “I think it’s unfortunate,” her grandmother said of the situation. “I’m glad they’re going to make it right. Chloe worked very hard on this.” WJHL attempted to contact the vendor Tuesday morning and is waiting to hear back.

In other words, capitalists make profits because their costs are externalized and born by others. In the US, society and the environment have to pick up the tab produced by capitalist activity. In the past when critics raised the question about external costs, that is, costs that are external to the company although produced by the company’s activities, economists answered that it was not really a problem, because those harmed by the activity could be compensated for the damages that they suffered. This statement was intended to reinforce the claim that capitalism served the general welfare. However, the extremely primitive nature of American property rights meant that rarely would those suffering harm be compensated. The apologists for capitalism saved the system in the abstract, but not in reality. My recent article, “The Destruction of Inlet Beach,” made it clear to me that very little, if any, of the real estate development underway would be profitable if the external costs imposed on existing property holders had to be compensated. http://www.paulcraigroberts.org/2017/04/17/destruction-inlet-beach/ Consider just a few examples. When a taller house is constructed in front of one of less height, the Gulf view of the latter is preempted. The damage to the property value of the house whose view has been blocked is immense. Would the developer build such a tall structure if the disadvantaged existing property had to be compensated for the decline in its value? When a house is built that can sleep 20 or 30 people next to a family’s vacation home or residence, the noise and congestion destroys the family’s ability to enjoy their own property. If they had to be compensated for their loss, would the hotel, disquised as a “single family dwelling” have been built? Walton County, Florida, is so unconcerned about these vital issues that it has permitted construction of structures that can accommodate 30 people, but provide only three parking spaces. Where do the rental guests park? How many residents will find themselves blocked in their own driveways or with cars parked on their lawns? As real estate developers build up congestion, travel times are extended. What formerly was a 5 minute drive from Inlet Beach to Seaside along 30-A can now take 45 minutes during summer and holidays, possibly longer. Residents and visitors pay the price of the developers’ profits in lost time. The road is a two-lane road that cannot be widened. Yet Walton County’s planning department took no account of the gridlock that would emerge. As the state and federal highways serving the area were two lanes, over-development made hurricane evacuation impossible. Florida and US taxpayers had to pay for turning two lane highways into four lane highways in order to provide some semblance of hurricane evacuation. After a decade, the widening of highway 79, which runs North-South is still not completed to its connection to Interstate 10. Luckily, there have been no hurricanes. If developers had to pay these costs instead of passing them on to taxpayers, would their projects still be profitable? Now consider the external costs of offshoring the production of goods and services that US corporations, such as Apple and Nike, market to Americans. When production facilities in the US are closed and the jobs are moved to China, for example, the American workers lose their jobs, medical coverage, careers, pension provision, and often their self-respect when they are unable to find comparable employment or any employment. Some fall behind in their mortgage and car payments and lose their homes and cars. The cities, states, and federal governments lose the tax base as personal income and sales taxes decline and as depressed housing and commercial real estate prices in the abandoned communities depress property taxes. Social security and Medicare funding is harmed as payroll tax deposits fall. State and local infrastructure declines. Possibly crime rises. Safety net needs rise, but expenditures are cut as tax revenues decline. Municipal and state workers find their pensions at risk. Education suffers. All of these costs greatly exceed Apple’s and Nike’s profits from substituting cheaper foreign labor for American labor. Contradicting the neoliberal claims, Apple’s and Nike’s prices do not drop despite the collapse in labor costs that the corporations experience. A country that was intelligently governed would not permit this. As the US is so poorly governed, the executives and shareholders of global corporations are greatly enriched because they can impose the costs associated with their profits on external third parties. The unambigious fact is that US capitalism is a mechanism for looting the many for the benefit of the few. Neoliberal economics was constructed in order to support this looting. In other words, neoliberal economists are whores just like the Western print and TV media. Yet, Americans are so insouciant that you will hear those who are being looted praise the merits of “free market capitalism.” So far we have barely scratched the surface of the external costs that capitalism imposes. Now consider the pollution of the air, soil, waterways, and oceans that result from profit-making activities. Consider the radioactive wastes pouring out of Fukushima since March 2011 into the Pacific Ocean. Consider the dead zones in the Gulf of Mexico from agricultural chemical fertilizer run-off. Consider the destruction of the Apalachicola, Florida, oyster beds from the restricted river water that feeds the bay due to overdevelopment upstream. Examples such as these are endless. The corporations responsible for this destruction bear none of the costs. If it turns out that global warming and ocean acidification are consequences of capitalism’s carbon-based energy system, the entire world could end up dead from the external costs of capitalism. Free market advocates love to ridicule economic planning, and Alan Greenspan and Larry Summers actually said that “markets are self-regulating.” There is no sign anywhere of this self-regulation. Instead, there are external costs piled upon external costs. The absence of planning is why over-development has made 30-A dysfunctional, and it is why over-development has made metropolitan areas, such as Atlanta, Georgia, dysfunctional. Planning does not mean the replacement of markets. It means the provision of rules that produce rational results instead of shifting costs of development onto third parties. If capitalism had to cover the cost of its activities, how many of the activities would pay? As capitalists do not have to cover their external costs, what limits the costs? Once the external costs exceed the biosphere’s ability to process the waste products associated with external costs, life ends. We cannot survive an unregulated capitalism with a system of primitive property rights. Ecological economists such as Herman Daly understand this, but neoliberal economists are apologists for capitalist looting. In days gone by when mankind’s footprint on the planet was light, what Daly calls an “empty world,” productive activities did not produce more wastes than the planet could cleanse. But the heavy foot of our time, what Daly calls a “full world,” requires extensive regulation. The Trump administration’s program of rolling back environmental protection, for example, will multiply external costs. To claim that this will increase economic growth is idiotic. As Daly (and Michael Hudson) emphasize, the measure known as Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is so flawed that we do not know whether the increased output costs more to produce than it is worth. GDP is really a measure of what has been looted without reference to the cost of the looting. Environmental deregulation means that capitalists can treat the environment as a garbage dump. The planet can become so toxic that it cannot recover. In the United States and generally across the Western world, property rights exist only in a narrow, truncated form. A developer can steal your view forever and your solitude for the period his construction requires. If the Japanese can have property rights in views, in quiet which requires noise abatement, and in sun fall on their property, why can’t Americans? After all, we are alleged to be the “exceptional people.” But in actual fact, Americans are the least exceptional people in human history. Americans have no rights at all. We hapless insignificant beings have to accept whatever capitalists and their puppet government impose on us. And we are so stupid we call it “Freedom and Democracy America.” The original source of this article is Paul Craig Roberts Copyright © Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, Paul Craig Roberts, 2017 Comment on Global Research Articles on our Facebook page Become a Member of Global Research Articles by: Dr. Paul Craig Roberts http://paulcraigroberts.org About the author:Paul Craig Roberts, former Assistant Secretary of the US Treasury and Associate Editor of the Wall Street Journal, has held numerous university appointments.

By Corazon Victorino On 04/25/17 AT 11:04 PM Close A new report is shedding light on what Apple is planning for its next Apple Watch smartwatch. And it appears the Cupertino giant’s next move is what South Korea companies Samsung and LG fear the most. Tim Cook’s company is said to be eyeing a new technology for the Apple Watch 3 and its iPhones that will surely be a game changer for the two manufacturers.  A recent Business Korea report stated industry watchers are predicting that there will be drastic changes to Apple’s relationship with the South Korean component industry starting this year. This is because Apple is now planning to use the new power-efficient display technology called micro-LED for its Apple Watch Series 3. The same display technology is expected to be used in making the iPhones that would come after this year’s iPhone 8.  The micro-LED technology is the next-generation display after the currently in-demand organic light-emitting diode (OLED). The former is thinner and lighter and measures only five to 10 micrometers, and these are the reasons why Apple wants to use the technology for its next smartwatch. In February, the Cupertino giant was granted a patent for sensing infrared diodes on the surface of a display. Apple is said to be working with LuxVue, which it acquired last year, in making this happen with micro-LED.  The inclusion of sensing infrared diodes into a micro-LED panel would mean that the screen itself would be capable of reading fingerprints. Thus, it is possible for the next Apple Watch to have Touch ID functionality on its display. The same technology is then expected to be present in the iPhones following this year’s iPhone 8, which is speculated to have a similar technology or one that involves placing an optical sensor below a glass surface.  READ: Apple reportedly not releasing iPhone 7s, 7s Plus this year According to AppleInsider, the use of micro-LED in the Apple Watch 3 would actually be the stepping stone for Apple to move away from OLED. If micro-LED is successfully incorporated into the upcoming smartwatch, Apple could move forward with producing larger micro-LED panels that would be suitable for its future iPhones. Hence, Samsung’s involvement in creating screens for this year’s iPhone would only be temporary.  While the innovative technology would surely be groundbreaking, Samsung and LG are threatened for different reasons. Apparently, Apple’s micro-LED displays would be sourced from Taiwan-based plant Taoyuan. And though Apple is rumored to be ordering only a small quantity of micro-LED panels later this year, the problem would become apparent once the tech giant decides to solely use micro-LED for its upcoming smartwatches and smartphones. Apple’s possible move away from OLED would greatly affect Samsung and LG. Apple is currently ordering its OLED panels for its Apple Watch devices from LG Display. Should Tim Cook’s company move forward with micro-LED, industry sources are anticipating LG to lose an estimated $201.35 million. On the other hand, Samsung Display is the supplier of OLEDs for the iPhone 8, so this would also lead to big losses for the Galaxy S8 maker.  Apart from OLED displays, Samsung and LG are also fearing for when Apple starts sourcing other components like RAM and cameras from other companies. There is word that Apple is seeking to acquire Toshiba’s memory business, and this could mean the end of the road for Samsung’s memory-focused relationship with Apple. For almost two decades, the Cupertino giant has been one of the largest RAM customers of Samsung.  Meanwhile, AppAdvice has said that the next-generation Apple Watch could also come equipped with cellular connectivity. Though no design changes are being anticipated, Apple is said to be focused on creating a wearable with better battery life and overall performance than its predecessors. There is no information on the release date of the Apple Watch Series 3 yet, but several sources are saying that consumers should expect it to arrive in the third quarter of this year. Apple Watch is said to be using an advanced display technology for its next Apple Watch.

The hour-long compendium — which will initially be an Apple Music exclusive — was intended as a surprise for fans, but also somewhat mandated as one, since Paisley didn’t get around to filming 15 of the 16 concept videos until a month ago (the exception being “Today,” which came out in 2016). Indeed, one of his new song titles, “Let’s Go to Bed Early,” may have fresh meaning for Paisley after the series of punishing all-nighters he pulled as co-director to get the whole collection to Apple on time. Then again, Paisley has long looked like he was having a little more fun making music videos than just about any of his country music contemporaries. He didn’t just nick some of Mark Knopfler’s fluid picking style for his virtuosic own; as a child of the 1980s, he also has fond memories of when “we all started making little movies for singles, and with MTV, it was like, ‘We could really get their attention if Dire Straits is a cartoon.’” So his doing it in bulk isn’t necessarily a complete shock. Paisley spoke with Variety about balancing comedy and tears in the new collections, pulling in Mick Jagger and John Fogerty for guest appearances, and the rush to the finish line for what surely won’t be the last everything-at-once video album the genre produces. Seeing as very few visual collections — where every song on an album has an accompanying conceptual video — exist, were you inspired by Beyoncé’s video album?  I didn’t see all of “Lemonade,” but I loved what I saw. Obviously my take on this is a completely different thing. On the songs that lend themselves to comedy, that’s what I’m doing, and the same with the more poignant songs, because the first half of this record is really a lot more upbeat than the second half. You know me. I live in the extremes. When did you decide to do this? It wasn’t until the “Today” video [for the album’s first single, released late last year] that I got the idea to do this visual album. I saw the way that just blew up and was really connecting. So I went to the label and half-jokingly said, “I can do this with every song on this record. They’re all very visual.” It was [Sony Music Nashville’s executive VP of marketing & new business] John Zarling’s first day when I suggested that, and John, who moved over in January from Big Machine, said, “Seriously?” And the rest of the label people, I honestly know they were saying, “Yeah, right. They’re never gonna make it.” And then Apple Music said, “Listen, we feel like this would be perfect for what we’re doing with our platform.” And I said, “Well, all right, I’ll get it to you.” And we went guerilla-style, everywhere we could do this. And  the rest of the videos, besides “Today,” were done just in the last month or so? I feel like a deadline that’s that imminent makes you go with your best instincts right off the bat, as opposed to you have six months to sit around and tweak something. “Heaven South” ended up being the last video shot, Saturday before last. Which is funny, because we were going to do that first, just because it’s the first track on the album, and then it rained cats and dogs in Franklin (the small-town square of which is the setting for a massive crowd scene) — that’s Nashville, this time of year — so we had to push it two weeks. This has been the craziest few weeks of my life in many ways. We turned my studio into an edit bay. On the heels of finishing this video, which was all-nighters, one after another, I went straight from that to the “Good Morning America circuit,” which is all 4 a.m. call times. I’m feeling a little out of whack, but good. Where Beyoncé was kind of aiming at telling a single story, you’re telling 16 stories. I hope that “One Beer Can” cracks you up, and I hope to tug on the emotions with the one-two punch of “Love and War,” with me and John Fogerty on the deck of an aircraft carrier, which fades into “Today,” as the soldiers come home. I hope that there’s not a dry eye watching that… We had sort of one-line log lines for each of these. With “Heaven South,” it was essentially “Truck through Franklin, a la (the Kentucky Headhunters’ ‘80s video) ‘Keep Your Hands to Yourself’.” And for “Last Time for Everything,” it was “Stranger Things and Knight Rider.” Next thing you know, David Hasselhoff found out I was using the Knight Rider car and said. “I’m around if you want me in it.” I said, well, yeah, what time, where? You say where and when, we’re doing it. “Go to Bed Early” was “pop-up concert in a Sleep Number store,” which was more fun than you can imagine, and also terrifying for me. We had me in an anti-gravity chamber for “Contact High.” In “One Beer Can,” that’s my parents’ house. We cast 30 Belmont students [for a raucous high school party scene]. I never did that to my mother — I never threw that party — so it serves her right that finally at my age I’m trashing her house. With a donkey. The video for “Go to Bed Early,” where you walk through a mall and end up playing a concert in a Sleep Number store was one way of solving the problem of how you were going to do a video about sleeping with someone. It looks like the reactions really are that spontaneous. I haven’t been in a mall in a while. I remember calling my manager eight or 10 years ago saying “Well, you’ve done a good job,” because I had gone in the Cool Springs Mall, where we filmed this, incognito, and I remember getting on the escalator and realizing that people were looking out of stores at me all the way down. You’re a sitting duck in a mall if you’re a celebrity. It’s like that scene from ‘Guarding Tess,’ I think it is, where Shirley MacLaine goes to the mall just to feel good about her celebrity. Word spreads in this fishbowl. I said, “I think what’s really funny is, this is a really sexy song. But what if there’s just a banner that says ‘Free live music, 5 p.m.,’ in the Sleep Number store, and then I just walk in.” We ended up filming that on Good Friday, so it was packed. All that’s real. We didn’t really re-do it. None of us noticed any of the reactions in the moment. Like, I didn’t notice the way the girls reacted when I took their waffle fries. I might as well have been the Easter bunny. This came together late enough that it’s probably not easy to reconvene all your guest stars. You must’ve been glad you had some in-studio footage of Mick Jagger recording your duet of “Drive of Shame,” which has already been released as a single in the U.K. I’m really thankful that he’s willing to allow that (footage). When you’re with somebody as iconic as Mick Jagger or John Fogerty, I’m really aware that in asking these guys to collaborate with me, I don’t want to add a footnote to their career that’s like: “Shouldn’t’ have done that.” It’s important to make sure that they’re well represented. What’s amazing with the way that we edited “Drive of Shame,” all you see from Mick for about the first half of the song is an elbow, but you know it’s him, don’t you? The same with Fogerty. [In “Love and War,” a song about veterans being forgotten], it’s like you’ve probably been thinking, “You make a good point,” but the minute you hear Fogerty’s voice, it’s like, “Now we’re gonna really take this serious, I guess, because he’s talking now, and he knows what he’s talking about.” Your voices work as well together as one could hope on the Jagger duet. You never really know what the blend is going to be until you hear it. The trick with Mick and with John is [to tell them], “Listen, don’t come [toward] me — don’t try to be country-er than you are. You have influenced country music to a degree you don’t realize, maybe.” There’s so much of our airwaves that are those guys. So, “All you gotta be is yourself. You fit. You belong. We’ve already come to you.” Not only that, but I’ve been ripping off the Rolling Stones since I was 12, so it’s like, all I had to do was not disguise it. Was it tough to get Fogerty to turn up to shoot alongside a military ship in San Diego on the spur of the moment? We’re really close. This is a man who practices guitar four hours a day, still. He’s committed to learning new things. He’s bought some gear that’s stuff that I use and vice versa; I’ve bought some stuff that he uses. There’s a mutual love there. The other thing with John is, he believes in this message. What was so heady was, when we sat down to write, he said, “This is the first time I’ve ever co-written.” I said, what? He said, “Yeah, sometimes other people were part of the song by the end of it, but as far as co-writing, I don’t do this.” I said, “You’re gonna love this, because it’s a lot less lonely and only one of us has to come up with a given line.” I told him the idea (about military veterans) and said, “I know this may not be a well you want to go back to right now.” He said, “No, I want to say this, this is a point I want to make, I’m sick and tired of what’s going on, and I agree.” He was all in, so it really was easy to say, John, I’ve got a video idea for this, what do you think? Absolutely. The same with this past Sunday night [where Fogerty showed up for a lengthy jam with Paisley at the famous Tootsie’s nightclub in Nashville]. I said we were doing an album launch thing, and did he want to come in? He said, “I’ve always wanted to take over a bar in Nashville and just jam. Do you want to do that?” This was all him. So in that sense, it’s been easy. He’s got a lot of energy for… uh… 50 years old or whatever he is. [Laughs.] As far as release patterns nowadays, everybody’s experimenting. Do you give people one song at a time, or everything at once? And if it’s everything at once, do you prepare them for it or surprise them? With this project, it’s a traditional album setup, but you’re also surprising people with the video album by, I don’t want to say dumping… [Laughs.] We’re squatting. Yeah. Is there some sweet spot in getting the public’s attention where you do things traditionally but also throw an element of surprise into it? Surprise is important. I think that’s the essence of entertainment, really. In this case, it’s also because it was a last-minute sort of edit.  We didn’t have the luxury of knowing we were gonna do this six months ago, video-wise. I wasn’t even sure which exact songs were going on here six months ago. “Meaning Again” [the album closer] wasn’t written until February, and shoot, “Last Time for Everything” [the just-released second single off the album] wasn’t written until January or February. So I was still looking for the missing pieces, and as soon as I had them, then this came about. I knew I wanted to do something like this, but I didn’t know if we had the time. Now it’s like, well, how do you best present this to people? What’s nice about this is there aren’t really rules. We’re all working in a broken industry right now. We’re working in an industry where people still love music, they still want music, but they don’t seem to want it the way we’re giving it to them. And so it’s a fun time to try things. I mean, I kind of like the anarchy of that. I sort of like the fact that we don’t have a lot to lose, in some ways. Getting it wrong just sort of means status quo. Getting it right means we learn something, and we might have delivered people something they really wanted. Filed Under: Apple Music Beyonce Brad Paisley Want to read more articles like this one?

Apple has just unveiled its latest store in Dubai with a 186-foot curved glass storefront and balcony overlooking Burj Khalifa and the Dubai Fountain. Like its other stores, Apple Dubai Mall is also designed to be an “open and transparent” community space that blurs barriers inside and out. Taking Dubai’s heat into consideration Foster + Partners have designed eighteen 37.5-foot-high motorised “Solar Wings” that respond to the climate. So, when the temperature is at its hottest they will cool the store, and open up for people to come into the public terrace in the evenings. Inspired by the traditional Arabic Mashrabiya, each of these solar wings are locally fabricated from 340 carbon fibre reinforced polymer rods, and at 180 feet wide, the 18 panels make up one of the world’s largest kinetic art installations. “We view our stores as a modern-day town square, where visitors come to shop, be inspired, learn or connect with others in their community,” said Angela Ahrendts, Apple’s senior vice president of Retail, adding that there was no better place to do this than overlooking Dubai’s epicenter, where the Dubai Fountain, Burj Khalifa and Dubai Mall meet. We are so honoured to have a home at one of the world’s most incredible and dynamic intersections.” Apple already has two stores in the United Arab Emirates which have welcomed more than 4 million visitors since opening 18 months ago. Apple hopes it will reach even more global visitors at the Dubai Mall, Emaar’s flagship mega-project with over 80 million visitors for the past three consecutive years. The company’s new “Today at Apple” concept will launch at this venue and in all 495 Apple Stores next month with new sessions across photo and video, music, coding, art and design, and more, led by highly-trained team members. On opening day there will be Live Art with Myneandyours, and Artist Duos with musician Hamdan Al Abri and artist Sultan Al Ramahi. The store has 148 employees who speak 45 languages.

While the Apple store has long had introductory courses for those new to Apple gadgets, the Cupertino-based tech giant today has announced a new global plan to turn the nearly 500 Apple stores to turn them into tech education centres. The new program, called Today at Apple, can be traced back to the redesign of the flagship San Francisco store last year, decreasing the shelves that display products on sale to make room for a "town square", which displays artwork and hosts educational talks, as the centre of the store. The free programs are pitched at a variety of skill levels, and range from the basics of which button to hit to how to brand yourself on social media with the artwork you create. An example is photography, using the iPhone that has become the world's most popular camera. iPhone 7 Plus put to test: A video and photo montage created using an iPhone 7 Plus featuring the Sydney Harbour, Sydney Opera House and the Qantas historical aviation collection in Sydney. In the changes to the Apple stores outline by Apple's senior vice president of retail Angela Ahrendts, which begin rolling out next month, people will still take their broken gadgets to the Genius Bar to get fixed but they will now attend sessions on how to use their devices by a mix of professionals and what Apple is calling its "Creative Pros". Photos View Photo Gallery   SOME OF THE PROGRAMS ON OFFER - Studio Hours are Apple's version of a professor's office hours. Creative Pros host 90-minute sessions on topics from art and design to documents and presentations. Anyone is welcome to bring in a personal project for advice from experts, or to use the space to work alongside others. - Photo or Sketch Walks help attendees go beyond capturing moments by exploring new techniques hands on as they interact in their local community. Photo Walks include sessions such as framing architecture or capturing action on video, while Sketch Walks explore observational drawings, watercolour and brush techniques, and more. - Kids Hour is designed to spark imagination and creativity through fun, hands-on projects. Sessions include coding with Sphero robots, Creating Music with GarageBand®, and Making Movies Together with iMovie®. - Coding sessions are meant to introduce anyone to coding through Swift Playgrounds™, an iPad® app designed to make coding interactive and fun for beginners. These sessions will explore coding concepts with the same code professional developers use every day.** - Photo Labs bring in talented photographers to experiment with new techniques and styles or uncover a new point of view in hands-on sessions. Similarly, Music Labs explore different genres and beats to introduce new tools to musicians of all levels.* - Pro Series take advanced users on a deep dive into Final Cut Pro® X and Logic Pro® X with sessions on colour correction and grading to post production, or audio mixing to editing for emotion, and more.* - Perspectives and Performances, offered at select stores, feature influential artists and musicians talking about their creative process or sharing their talents live.   apple Read More Login to follow editors picks Read More Login to follow Topics:  apple editors picks 0 PRINT Have your say Just In 'Randy' the dog stolen by owner who is now in watch-house Why Games prospect Jordyn is so busy Play for a good cause Watch Toowoomba teen thrill on The Voice tonight Rare cold water shark washes up dead on beach Socceroos to look into guest appearance at Copa America Top Stories 'Randy' the dog stolen by owner who is now in watch-house Woman charged after pinching 'chihuahua on steroids' from pound News 26th Apr 2017 4:14 PM Comment Why Games prospect Jordyn is so busy Play for a good cause Wolston Park Golf Club to host annual charity day next month.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile A Prominent Wireless Charging Tech Company CEO Calls Wireless Charging a “Standard Feature in the Next iPhone” By Rafia Shaikh 7 hours ago 17Shares Share Tweet Submit Celebrating the tenth anniversary of the iPhone lineup, this year’s rumored iPhone 8 is expected to bring a number of new features and design changes. Major improvements include OLED display and wireless charging. Several rumors and reports had previously indicated that Cupertino tech giant is finally ready to bring better screen technology along with wireless charging to catch up with its Android competition. Now, the CEO of a premier wireless technology company appears to believe the same. iPhone 8 wireless technology – a done deal? iPhone 8 wireless charging feature has been mentioned in more than a few rumors and analyst reports. Back in February, Apple officially confirmed joining the Wireless Power Consortium further fueling these expectations. Now, the CEO of a wireless charging technology company has said he considers iPhone 8 wireless charging a “standard feature in the next iPhone,” hinting that he is certain that it will definitely happen. Related ‘Today At Apple’ Sessions Expanding To Every Apple Store Starting May In an unrelated announcement press release, Powermat CEO Elad Dubzinski said (via 9to5mac): Advertisement “With the recent announcement by Apple that wireless charging will become a standard feature in the next iPhone, we are finally at the threshold of mainstream adoption,” said Mr. Dubzinski. “Dan Stone has a proven track record of success and is uniquely qualified to help guide Powermat to the next level of service delivery. Under his guidance, CompuCom has enjoyed a reputation for delivering unparalleled IT support for enterprise clients and their end users. We look forward to benefitting from his experience and guidance.” Apple hasn’t itself made any announcement claiming that wireless charging will become a standard feature. But, Dubzinski could be referring to the company’s joining the WPC. “Apple is an active member of many standards development organizations, as both a leader and contributor,” Apple has said following its joining of the Consortium. “Apple is joining the Wireless Power Consortium to be able to participate and contribute ideas to the open, collaborative development of future wireless charging standards.” Related Alleged iPhone 8 Motherboard Drawings Confirm ‘L’ Shape To Conserve Space & Reduce Width Following Apple’s announcement, Powermat had said that the company “would be ready to support iPhones with whatever wireless charging protocol Apple employs,” hinting that it doesn’t really know how Apple will approach wireless charging. While probably nothing more than an expectation based on insider and analyst reports, Powermat CEO’s statement further adds to several previous reports, including those from the KGI Securities and analyst Christopher Roland, that we will soon be seeing iPhones supporting wireless charging.

These are our favorite iPhone apps to be productive on the iPhone, have fun, lose weight, relax and entertain ourselves. You can use these on the iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus as well as older iPhones. Our favorite iPhone apps are a mix of free and paid apps, and anything on this list is an app that we would buy a second time if we had to. Whether you are new to the iPhone, upgrading from an ancient iPhone or just looking for the best new iPhone apps to install — this list has something for you. Best iPhone Apps Here are the best iPhone apps to download in 2017. These best iPhone apps work on any device that runs iOS 10, and many will also work on iOS 9. If you have the iPhone 4 or the iPhone 7, there are great iPhone apps on this list for you to use. Most of these apps are optimized for the bigger screens of the iPhone 6, iPhone 6s, Phone 6 Plus, iPhone 6s, iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus — but they will work fine on smaller screens like the iPhone SE or iPhone 4s too. Best iPhone Photography Apps Best iPhone Games Best iPhone Entertainment Apps Best Business iPhone Apps Best iPhone Shopping Apps Best iPhone Health Apps Best iPhone Social Media Apps Best iPhone Travel Apps Best iPhone Budget Apps Best iPhone Apps to Save Money Best iPhone Fitness Apps Best iPhone Weight Loss Apps Best iPhone Apps to Make Money Best iPhone Alarm Clock Apps Best iPhone Racing Games for iPhone Best iPhone Diabetes Apps Best Math Apps Some of these include 3D Touch support for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus that allows users to use added functions with a harder press on the screen. These apps can connect you to other people, control your home, entertain you with games, music, and audiobooks and help you be more productive with the time you have. The Best iPhone Apps Here are the iPhone apps that I use the most. These are the iPhone apps that I keep on my home screen and the dock. Although this list doesn’t break down into nice categories, here is a look at the most useful iPhone apps I own. I’ll leave the default Apple apps off this list, but there are many on my home screen that I cannot live without. Google Maps – Hands down a better way to get from one place to the next or to search for places than Apple Maps. It has yet to tell me to drive off a non-existent bridge. I cannot say the same about Apple Maps. Huntington – Even with text notifications it is important for me to have access to my banking app on the home screen, and the ability to remotely deposit checks with the iPhone. SoundCloud – A great way to check out sets from music festivals and hard to find tracks from DJs and artists before they are on other services. Spotify – The best way to listen to music on the iPhone. Spotify is more evolved than Apple Music and it is a bargain at $9.99 a month. Audible – I listen to an incredible number of Audiobooks and Audible is the best place to buy them. With a subscription I save on audiobooks each month. Dark Sky – Great, hyper local forecasts and push notifications that tell me when it is going to rain or snow. Alien Blue – This is still the best iPhone Reddit app I’ve found, but I am looking for a replacement. Slack – If you work on a team or in a small office forget the hassles of email for internal communication and switch to Slack. You’ll love it. Asana – This is a to do list app and service that works great for teams, but you can also use it for your own tasks and projects. MyFitnessPal – MyFitnessPal is one of the best weight loss iPhone apps and it was the key to helping me lose 25 pounds this year. After a break I am back in the app to keep the weight off. Nest – The Nest app connects to my Nest thermostat to let me control the temperature of my house from bed or from a hundred miles away. This saves me energy and it’s an awesome convenience app. Harmony – I use the Harmony app along with the Logitech Harmony Ultimate Home remote and hub to control my home entertainment and lights. I can tap on Play Xbox One and the Tv, Xbox, soundbar and lights all turn to the right settings. I can also control my TV volume and channels with the iPhone. Hue – I control and customize five Hue lights with this app. I will be upgrading soon to use Siri to control the lights. Lutron Caséta – The Lutron Caséta app lets me use Siri and the app to turn lamps on and off at home using the Caséta Wireless switches and to control my Kitchen Lights after I replaced the switches. No need to upgrade bulbs for a smart home experience. MyQ – This app lets me open and close my Chamberlain WiFi garage door with my iPhone. I get push notifications, although on iOS 9 they sometimes double up, to let me know someone opened the door. HDE OTP – I use this app instead of Google Authenticator to track the many One Time Passwords I need to use as Two-Factor Authentication for several websites. Hangouts – Google Hangouts is an essential tool for communicating with friends, co-workers and family. LastPass – I only need to remember one password and I can use my long list of complicated passwords. Touch ID allows me to reach them with the touch of a finger instead of typing my password out. Read my LastPass review. Tweetbot 4 – The newest version of Tweetbot is an amazing way to connect to Twitter. It handles all my needs for sending messages and the new Activity tab removes the need for me to use the default Twitter app to track follows and retweets. Gmail – The Gmail app is a great way for most users to check email on the iPhone and an essential app for many people on our team. Notion – Notion.ai is the best iPhone email app you can find. It delivers smart notifications, easy inbox management and even knows when someone asks you a question. You need to try this app out today. These three apps earn an honorable mention on my home screen list since I keep them with easy access on my second home screen so that I can always access them. Evernote – The new Notes app is my go to app, but Evernote still offers a great place to save and track notes. I used this to track all communication about lost luggage and to share the notebook with interested parties easily. Workflow – Workflow lets you automate activities and tasks on the iPhone 6s, and it supports 3D Touch quick actions to your favorites. I am just scratching the surface of what it can do and I am amazed. Kindle – The Kindle app is my go to app for reading. I love it because I can use it to start a book, read more later on my Kindle and also always have the freedom to jump to another platform. 1Password – If you aren’t a fan of LastPass, 1Password is an excellent option that helps you keep all of your passwords safe behind, you guessed it one password. Calm – When you need a break from your hectic life, the Calm app will help you relax and refresh using your iPhone, headphones and a chair. Ring – You’ll need the Ring doorbell to make use of this app, but once you install it you can see and talk to people who ring your doorbell, even if you are miles away. Best iPhone Photography Apps I use these iPhone photography apps to make my photos look better, connect to my camera and share photos and videos. I use iCloud Photo Library to back up my photos, but if you don’t you should check out Flickr or Google Photos. YouTube Capture – – Record videos quickly and upload to YouTube in a snap. Perfect for content creators. Camera+ – A handy app that can perform magical automatic fixes for photos that need better lighting with one touch. Instagram – Fun place to explore photos and share photos. 3D Touch makes browsing in the Explore mode easier than ever. PlayMemories Mobile – I use this app to connect to my Sony RX 100 III and transfer photos to the iPhone for editing and sharing. Pixelmator – My favorite desktop photo editor is now on iPhone allowing me to quickly fix up and edit photos. iMovie – I often shoot review videos on the iPhone 6s and I can use iMovie to edit the 4K video I shoot and then choose to upload in 4K or in 1080P. TouchReTouch – This app performs miracles when you need to restore an old photo that has cracks, creases and damage. Simply amazing. Darkroom – This is another photo editing app that I enjoy using on the iPhone 6s. One thing I like is that there are sliders on one screen to adjust multiple options so I can easily adjust one and then the next. Afterlight – Powerful photo editing tool with filters, lots of control and the option to tap to see the original and let go to see your current edits for easy before and after editing. Layout – A simple tool from Instagram to combine photos into a collage on the iPhone to share on Instagram or another service. Best iPhone Games Here are the best iPhone games that I enjoy playing. There are a lot of great iPhone games out there and we expect to see more games add 3D Touch for the iPhone 6s in the coming weeks and months. Monument Valley – A fun and challenging puzzle style game that tasks gamers with moving the environment around until you can get your character to the right door. Threes! – Slide tiles around to match up numbers. Starts off simple, but gets challenging quickly as your numbers climb higher. Alto’s Adventure – Jump and ski your way to the bottom of a never-ending mountain as you collect llamas, run from village elders and collect power ups. Agar.io – Control growing circle that expands as it absorbs smaller circles until you are the biggest blob on the board. Simple, but addicting. Siegefall – A strategy game similar to Clash of Clans, but with a less cartoonish look. This is my favorite of the tow games and worth trying out. Clash of Clans – We can’t list off the best apps without touching on Clash of Clans which many iPhone users are addicted to playing. If you like it, you probably love it. Shadowmatic – My latest addiction is a puzzle type game where you move objects around to create a shadow on the wall. It is a simple premise, but the difficulty increases as you progress. Does Not Commute – Guide cars around the city to get them to the destination without crossing and crashing with the traffic you already put into place with earlier cars. Madden Mobile – A small fix of Madden on the iPhone. It isn’t as good as Madden 16 on the Xbox One, but it is a fun way to pass some time. Smashy Road: Wanted – A fun time waster for driving around and escaping the police with simple graphics. Fallout Shelter – Manage resources and grow your shelter in this Fallout game that is a perfect fit for the iPhone screen size. Fun and frustrating at the same time as you balance inhabitants and resources. Super Sharp – This fun puzzle game is challenging, incredibly fun and frustrating. You cut parts of the level to hit targets and often need to set up several cuts to proceed. Best iPhone Entertainment Apps Here are the go to apps I use to watch video on the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. I don’t keep as many on here as I do on the iPad Air 2, but there are must have apps in this list. DirecTV – I can watch live TV on my iPhone using my DirecTV subscription. I don’t get all of my channels, but there are enough great options. WatchESPN – Finally I can use DirecTV to login to WatchESPN to see sports events and Sports Center on the go. NFL Mobile – With my Verizon iPhone 6s I can watch the Sunday Night, Monday Night and Thursday Night Football games live on the iPhone. Remote – The fastest way to control the Apple TV from the iPhone. Makes selection, searching and entering passwords very easy. Netflix – How else can I keep up on Narcos and binge watch too many TV shows on my iPhone for $8 a month? ESPN – I use this app to track teams, which lately simply lets me see how the Miami Dolphins are losing before my coworkers mention it. NFL Sunday Ticket – I am constantly busy on Sunday, no matter how I plan it, so I rely on NFL Sunday Ticket to watch the Miami Dolphins on my iPhone 6s. Xbox One SmartGlass – With this app I can connect to my Xbox to change the game I am playing, enter in text and see and respond to messages without leaving a game. Yahoo Fantasy  – You can use this app to track almost any thing you need to stay on top of your fantasy sports team. Hulu – If you don’t want to pay for cable, this is one of the easiest ways to keep up on the latest shows without buying a bunch of season passes in iTunes. HBO Go – Watch HBO on your iPhone using your cable login, or use HBO Now to watch with a subscription direct to HBO. Access new shows and the full library of HBO Shows, plus current movies. YouTube – The YouTube app is the fastest way to watch YouTube videos on your iPhone and a great way to subscribe to channels you like. Amazon Instant Video – Amazon Prime members can use this to watch free streaming video on the iPhone including movies and TV shows without an additional subscription. Best Business iPhone Apps I use these apps to keep on top of business needs from my iPhone, from tracking packages, checking invoices paid and other utilities. These iPhone apps help me get things done. UPS – With UPS My Choice and this app I can see when packages will come and even change delivery options if I need to. Fedex – With this app and registration with FedEx I can see all FedEx packages coming to my house from Ground and Express in one place. Even when I don’t have a tracking number. Speedtest – I often find myself testing the network connection and mobile connection before working or uploading a big file. With this app I can see if my current location supports what I need to do. Scanner Pro – Scanner Pro lets me quickly scan in a document without a scanner. The results are amazing and you would swear that it came from a full size scanner in an office. PayPal – Quickly send money, transfer money and make payments without the need to have cash on hand. Chrome – I don’t use Chrome as my main iPhone browser, but it is handy to have installed for use with the various Google apps I rely on and for checking the open tabs from Chrome on my Mac. Facebook Pages – I use this app to manage several Facebook pages. There is no real alternative, but it is still one of my must have apps. WordPress – If you work in WordPress this app can be a lifesaver when mobile. It does eat through battery life fast and it can crash, but it allows me to get work done with just an iPhone. Google – This is essentially the Google Now experience on the iPhone. It allows me to see important information and I use it for push notifications when orders I place ship and I get an email about it. Quicklytics – The best Google Analytics app for the iPhone. Real time view, overall stats, and access to filters that let me run more detailed reports from the iPhone. Expensify – An easy to use expensing app that captures receipts and cash transactions easily. I can then share an expense report in a few minutes from the web after the trip. Quickbooks – Although QuickBooks can be a pain to use in some instances, the app is a fast way to look at the most important information relating to my account. Parkmobile – No change, no problem. I use the Parkmobile app to pay for parking in many locations. I can even re-up parking without going back to my car if I am held over in a meeting. Sheets – My most used web app is Google Sheets. I use this app to reach important spreadsheets on the go. I don’t do a ton of work on them while mobile, but this makes it easier to reference. Pages – There are still times where I need to open a Pages document on my iPhone and I also use this to check the word count of items written in apps that don’t offer a word count tool. Dropbox – Still the most accessible and easy to use cloud storage client I’ve found. This is an easy way to get to my files and to upload files for access from anywhere. Paper by fifty three – This is a go to app for sketching and marking up images. It is easier to use on a bigger screen, but it is still handy to have on the iPhone 6s. Best iPhone Shopping Apps I use these iPhone shopping apps to save money on groceries and to simplify shopping from my iPhone for almost anything I need. I leave alerts on for GasBuddy since it will tell me if gas prices are going up in my area, but most of the other apps don’t get permission to push notifications. Amazon – The fastest way to order from Amazon. If you have Amazon Prime this is a must have app. Meijer – I use this app to clip coupons digitally that I use in the store to save significantly. If you use another grocer, like Kroger, check out this guide to digital grocery coupons. Square Register – When my wife works a craft show we use this app to accept credit cards from our phone. It works like a charm. Apple Store – The fastest place to order a new iPhone is also a handy place to look for iPhone 6s accessories and other Apple items. Best Buy – As a My Best Buy member I use this app to make purchases and to check my points balance as well as see if the local store has something I want in stock. Gas Buddy – Find the cheapest gas near you and get an alert when gas prices are set to go up so that you can fill up before the price changes. Starbucks – With the new mobile ordering option the Starbucks app isn’t just a great way to pay from Wallet. You can use this to place an order and skip the line at a busy Starbucks. Chipotle – An easy way to order from Chipotle so you can skip the line and get that Burrito goodness. OpenTable – This is the fastest way to get a reservation at a restaurant. Forget calling and checking multiple times over the phone and checking with your group. See what is open and then book it without making a call. Credit Karma – Use Credit Karma to get a free look at your credit score and you can get alerts when actions that impact your credit happen. Hobby Lobby – If you shop at Hobby Lobby you need to have this app installed so you can save 40% on one item each week. Best Health Apps RunKeeper – I’ve shifted a lot of my workouts to the Apple Watch’s built-in tracker, but when I want more detail, the Runkeeper app is a solid tool that can help you track your fitness goals. Fitnet – I just started testing Fitnet. The free iPhone app offers up short focused workouts based on your goals and includes an Apple Watch app and an Apple Watch complication that shows your progress. Activity – This app installs automatically once you connect an Apple Watch. It is an easy way to see how often I hit movement and workout goals. It can motivate or shame me into doing a better job. Sleep Cycle – This app uses your iPhone to monitor your sleep and then it will wake you up at the best time based on your sleep patterns. Best iPhone Apps for Social Media Facebook – I honestly go back and forth between uninstalling and installing the Facebook app because there are times I don’t want the distraction of Facebook in my hand. I always leave notifications off. Facebook Messenger – This app is the way that I keep in touch with many friends, and it is a must have on the iPhone 6s. Snapchat – I don’t snap a lot, but I enjoy using the fun new Snapchat Lenses to change the look with fun augmented reality filters. Untappd – This is a social network for beer lovers that can help you find new beers to try and enjoy. Best iPhone Travel Apps StubHub – When you need to find tickets for a concert or sporting event that is sold out, StubHub offers a trusted environment to find the tickets you want. TripIt – The best all in one travel organizer that tracks your hotel, flight, car rental and other activities simply by connecting your email to the app or forwarding a reservation. Flightaware – Always know where a flight is. This is the best way to track the flights that your loved ones or business associates are on. Hotel Tonight – Score last-minute reservations at amazing hotels at a bargain. You can book for tonight or up to seven days out. Grub Hub – An essential tool for ordering delivery from restaurants without making a phone call. Available in 800 cities and includes 30,000 restaurants. TripAdvisor – This is the fastest and easiest way to find things to do and check reviews of hotels and attractions on your iPhone. Waze – While I normally rely on Google Maps, Waze is a tool i use when traffic is an issue. It helped us avoid a huge traffic jam and get to an event with minutes to spare instead of waiting in traffic and missing out on an amazing experience. Yelp – Yelp is my go to tool for finding a new place to eat in a new city. We also use it to discover new stores when in a bigger city and on the hunt for something local. Glympse – This tool can help you tell people when you will get to a location. Just share a Glympse with them and they can see your current location and estimated time of arrival. 13 Responses 02/24/2016 Brittanylcarlson Reply 0=1my best friend’s half-sister makes $87 /hr on the laptop .

Not sure what you’re looking for in a client, but narwhal is a gesture driven app, and a decent fit to me.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Site Archive Town of Apple Valley officially opens Mojave Riverwalk South Tuesday Apr 25, 2017 at 5:47 PM Apr 25, 2017 at 5:54 PM Matthew Cabe Staff Writer @DP_MatthewCabe APPLE VALLEY — Elaine Clapp sure knows how to make an entrance. The 91-year-old town resident donated $48,000 to the Mojave Riverwalk South project for 12 benches installed along the nearly 3-mile trail, but a recent medical condition that required rehabilitation made her attendance at Tuesday’s ribbon-cutting ceremony doubtful. In fact, town staffers were so certain Clapp wouldn’t be in attendance, they included a message from her in a prepared speech to be read by Mayor Scott Nassif during the official opening of the Riverwalk that extends from the Bear Valley Road bridge to Apple Valley’s southern border at Poppy Road. But as Nassif detailed the story behind Clapp’s contribution to an audience of more than 60 — “Mrs. Clapp couldn’t be with us here today, but she wanted to send a message...” — he was suddenly interrupted. “She is!” a voice in the crowd exclaimed. All eyes then turned to locate the voice, but instead found Elaine Clapp seated comfortably in a wheelchair and wrapped in blankets that shielded her from the late-morning wind. Clapp’s presence confirmed, Nassif turned the mic over to the 31-year resident of Apple Valley. “You know, we traveled a lot,” Clapp said. “My husband and I traveled all around the world, but, you know, we always returned to Apple Valley. It was just home.” Clapp’s donation to the project was made in honor of her late husband, H. Bennett Clapp, whose name is enshrined on the first bench along the trail. With Elaine Clapp by his side, Nassif thanked the community for attending the event for the new trail that was “formerly a short dirt pathway running between the (Jess Ranch Marketplace) shopping center and the (Mojave) riverbed.” “During my year as mayor, I’ve always looked forward to opportunities to invite you to take ‘the road to better health,’” Nassif said. “This beautiful amenity will be accessible to all residents and neighbors alike, especially those in nearby Jess Ranch and Sun City.” Work on the 12-foot-wide concrete trail began last October and was funded by a $923,000 Active Transportation Program grant awarded to the town by the San Bernardino Council of Governments, according to a previous Daily Press report. A $40,000 local match, plus Clapp’s $48,000 donation, brought the total project funds to more than $1 million. Tuesday’s ribbon cutting comes just after the February completion of the Bear Valley Road Bike Path, and it marks the most recent addition to the town’s growing list of trails and bike paths, following the Ramona Road Widening project that added Class II bikeway striping on that road last summer. And in early May, bidding will open on a project that will upgrade the town’s 37-mile network of Class II bikeways to include new signs and striping. The project also includes microsurfacing and is estimated to cost approximately $1.5 million, town documents show. Meanwhile, with the ribbon officially cut for the Mojave Riverwalk South, residents thanked Clapp for her contribution and posed for pictures with her before walking along the path.  Clapp also made the trip — escorted by a Heritage Victor Valley Medical Group staff member — to see the benches installed in her husband’s memory. Her smile couldn’t be missed. Matthew Cabe can be reached at MCabe@VVDailyPress.com or at 760-951-6254. Follow him on Twitter @DP_MatthewCabe.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars DEV This app lets you completely disable Apple’s MacBook Pro Touch Bar Jordan Novet@jordannovet April 25, 2017 6:07 PM Above: 2016 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar. Image Credit: Jordan Novet / VentureBeat Apple, sorry. But there is a new app that will let people basically render the Touch Bar on the latest MacBook Pro laptops completely useless. It’s called TouchBarDisabler, from Georgia Tech computer science student Kay Yin. It doesn’t just work on the 2016 MacBook Pro; it also does its magic on the aptly named Touch Bar Simulator for Mac, or alternatively in Xcode’s virtual Touch Bar. Just know that you’ll need to disable System Integrity Protection (SIP) in order to get it running. Many apps have introduced support for the Touch Bar since Apple introduced it in October. Just to name a few: Coda, Dashlane, dJay Pro, Evernote, Sketch, and Tenor. But sentiment around the component isn’t all positive. Apple developer Marco Arment and former Apple senior engineering manager Michael Lopp are among those who aren’t fans of the secondary display that’s mounted just above the keyboard of the laptop. I’m with @rands on the Touch Bar, unfortunately. https://t.co/9MiL21FTzt — Marco Arment (@marcoarment) April 2, 2017 3 months of the Macbook Pro with Touchbar and it feels absolutely foreign going back to the old style keyboard with no touchbar. I'm sold. — philwinkle (@philwinkle) April 20, 2017 People have used the word “gimmick” to describe the Touch Bar more often than I can keep track of. The MacBook Pro Touch Bar is not a pro feature. I've had one for a couple of months now and I think it's a gimmick, at best. — Jack Brewster (@jackbrewster) April 16, 2017 a) Touch Bar = ergonomics-sapping gimmick, b) Subpar specs due to obsession with thickness/battery life, c) Too soon to drop ports, d) Bugs. — Michael Love (@elkmovie) April 16, 2017 So now you have something that literally stops the Touch Bar from doing anything — adjusting volume, adjusting display brightness, hitting the escape function, triggering the Siri virtual assistant, and so on. It’s not like you can even hold down the function button to bring back the F row — it’s just gone, period. This is a step up from what Apple itself allows you to do from System Preferences. If you’ve always wanted to just make the Touch Bar go away — instead of, say, loading it up with app and website shortcuts — this is the simplest method yet.

Yoshita Singh Urjit Patel made the remarks in response to a question on the rise of protectionist tendencies in major world economies at Columbia University. Photo: Mint New York: Cautioning against protectionism, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Urjit Patel has said where would huge American corporations like Apple, Cisco and IBM be if they had not sourced the best products and talent from across the world. “I don’t think that we have heard the last word on US policy talk about this because there is a push back internationally that the world has benefited from an open trading system,” the RBI governor said after delivering a lecture. He made the remarks in response to a question on the rise of protectionist tendencies in major world economies after he delivered the Third Kotak Family Distinguished Lecture, sponsored by the Raj Center on Indian Economic Policies at the Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs. He said the share prices of the most efficient corporations in the world, including in the US, are where they are because of the global supply chains. “Where would Apple be, where would Cisco be, where would IBM be if they were not sourcing the best products and talent from across the world. And if policies come in the way of that, then the big wealth creators in a country that advocates protectionism are ultimately affected,” he said on Monday. Patel said the calls for protectionism in the US were on account of equity and domestic distribution issues which “textbook economics tells us should be addressed through domestic fiscal policy” such as taxation and income transfers. He noted that using trade instruments for protectionism may take a nation on a trajectory different from that of growth. “Using trade instruments like customs duties, border tax etc is not the most efficient way to do this. In fact you could end up at somewhere else. You do not know what are the implications of some of these policies on equity and distribution besides objectives that you want to address,” he said. “It should be a domestic policy issue, using domestic fiscal policy if those are the objectives that need to be addressed,” Patel said. Talking about the Indian Rupee, the RBI governor said it was totally market determined and the intervention by the central bank was only to mitigate volatility. “I think that is a fair policy for us to follow going forward,” he said. Asked about the autonomy of the RBI, he said, “We have been imbued with a legislative responsibility of flexible inflation targeting framework only means that that is a plus for the autonomy and independence of the central bank.” On financial inclusion, he said the most important step that was taken was when every Indian household was given a bank account. He said it was now up to a variety of players including the Non Banking Financial Companies to use that opportunity. “I think the government should not use its fiscal resources for that. It has used its ownership of the public sector banks to open up these accounts and I think that’s a large subsidy,” he said. Asked if the federal compromise reached to implement the GST (goods and services tax) would structurally weaken the tax reform and not reach the potential growth opportunities projected, Patel said the manner in which the GST has been structured as cooperation between the central and the state government was a “great example of fiscal federalism” and that strengthens the GST as a policy. Patel was also questioned about the troubles and difficulties faced by non-resident Indians in exchanging the old currency notes following demonetisation. He said it was decided by the government and the RBI that at some point “there has to be an end to the demonetisation exercise.” “Every country that has done this has followed a certain course and so have we,” he said. Patel said under Foreign Exchange Management Act regulations people were only allowed to take Rs 25,000 abroad and people were given enough time post-demonetisation. “We needed to draw a line at some point. I think it has been a fairly generous time,” he said. On loan waivers, he said such measures do impact the credit culture. “The honest borrower and the taxpayer pays for this, we need to be very careful with this. There are other micro implications if this amount becomes large, they impact the fiscal situations of the state governments and ultimately could lead to some national balance sheet implications,” Patel said. He also said that China’s exchange rate policy has become more market determined.

The biggest of these will likely be the inclusion of an all-glass display and a revamped home button, as well as beefier hardware and larger base storage. We're also expecting this year's flagship to be the most expensive smartphone ever made by Apple, likely to exceed the $1000 mark. Apple iPhone 8 rumoured specs Release Early September 2017 Frame Stainless steel chassis, flat all-glass design Screen 5.8in edge-to-edge AMOLED display, cheaper 5.5in and 4.7in models using LCD Processor Apple A11 quad-core, running iOS 11 RAM 2GB, 3GB for Plus model Battery 'True' wireless charging up to 15ft, also wired Camera Dual lens 12MP, single lens for cheaper models Connectivity USB Type-C or Lightning  Picture above is of 2016's iPhone 7 Latest news 26/04/2017: Samsung OLED panel issues could delay iPhone 8 The iPhone 8 could be delayed because the device's component manufacturers are struggling to make new parts to Apple's high-end spec, according to the Nikkei Asian Review. The parts still missing from the final device include the display, wireless charging and printed circuit boards, sources "familiar with the company" said. Although no one has revealed who will be providing the new curved OLED screen it's thought that Samsung could be the manufacturer in question and although the giant does have the capacity to produce the part, a supply chain source said Samsung has come across a stumbling block getting the part approved by Apple. "There might be a one to two month delay in Samsung's production of OLED panels for Apple," said Brian Huh, an analyst at research company IHS Markit told the website. "Samsung originally plans to begin churning out OLED panels in May but now the schedule will likely be pushed back to the end of June or sometime in July." Sean Kao, an analyst at IDC added that the printed circuit boards were also causing issues. "There is a new design for a much smaller printed circuit board to allow a more powerful battery for this upcoming iPhone...but there are still some quality issue to overcome to achieve smooth mass production." However, the memory chips have already started arriving at Apple's manufacturing facility according to a memory chip executive involved in the iPhone's production. 25/04/2017: iPhone 8 release delayed until November The iPhone 8 has reportedly been delayed until October or November, because the new custom made components are taking longer to arrive than iPhone 7s parts. KGI's Ming-Chi Kuo, as reported by 9to5Mac, said the mass production of the iPhone 8's OLED screen is likely to be pushed back until October or November rather than being ready in August or September as is usually the case. Kuo said custom made parts causing problems include the iPhone's edge-to-edge OLED screen, a new Apple A11 SoC, 3D touch module and 3D sensing cameras - all significant upgrades to the iPhone. However, it's likely such a delay will have a negative impact on Apple's sales, as those due for an upgrade in September may look elsewhere for their next device. Or, they will hold fire and buy the device in 2018, which means there could be a sales slump this year compared to 2016's end of year numbers. But it's not all bad news for Apple fans, because KGI said it's likely the iPhone 7S will still launch in September, although it's a smaller upgrade and is unlikely to wow those looking for the latest tech. KGI thinks Apple's new smartphone releases, covering the iPhone 7S, 7S Plus and iPhone 8 will account for 110 million unit sales in the second half of 2017, although if the iPhone 8 is delayed by even a month, this could cause the estimations to be downgraded. 24/04/2017: iPhone 8's rear fingerprint sensor pictured in renders Last week's leaked iPhone 8 schematics have been turned into renders and the hole for the rear-mounted fingerprint sensor is very much alive. The renders, created by Instagram user bro.king, are not official, but show us what the iPhone 8 will look like if the fingerprint sensor is moved from the home button on the front to below the Apple icon on the back. It is possible these could be similar to Apple's final designs because the company tends to have a few possibilities up its sleeve, but of course, no one will know for certain until the device is launched later in the year. Another leaked photo, for example, claims to be a dummy device that will be used in stores to promote the next iPhone. Those photos look to be a completely different device, with no home button, but equally, no fingerprint sensor on the back of the phone. In fact, it looks a whole lot sleeker, with a full, edge-to-edge screen, although it looks a little plumper than the existing iPhone 7. Those pictures were revealed by Benjamin Geskin, who tweeted: "iPhone 8 Dummy (This is CNC model according to Foxconn). Back is 2.5D Glass. Matches all previous information. Long power button too." iPhone 8 Dummy (This is CNC model according to Foxconn) Back is 2.5D Glass.#iPhone8 #iPhoneX #iPhoneEdition pic.twitter.com/Z8mH7b7z4r — Benjamin Geskin (@VenyaGeskin1) April 23, 2017 These photos show an elongated power button on the side, with a very large camera on the back (although it didn't reveal whether there will be a flash sandwiched between two lenses as previously rumoured. 20/04/2017: Will Apple move the fingerprint sensor on the iPhone 8? Apple may move the iPhone 8's fingerprint sensor if new rumours circulated by known Apple tipster Sonny Dickson are to be believed. The renowned leaker has tweeted pictures of what he says are schematic drawings of the next iPhone, with the sensor on the back of the device, just below the Apple logo. According to other rumours from Pacific Crest Securities' Andy Hargreaves and Cowen and Company analyst Timothy Arcuri, Apple is apparently struggling to find a way to embed its fingerprint scanner on the front of the device with its new OLED displays, which could be a reason to place it on the back of the phone instead.  iPhone 8 looks to be taking a new direction pic.twitter.com/mG19bcDYiC — Sonny Dickson (@SonnyDickson) April 19, 2017 Dickson's leaked schematics also shows a larger camera cut-out, suggesting it will include a flash in between two lenses for taking 3D pictures and videos, or augmented reality footage as has previously been suggested. Although the current iPhone has dual lenses, the configuration is horizontal rather than vertical, as it would seemingly be on this new device. However, Hargreaves thinks these major changes in the iPhone 8's design may well cause delays for the device's launch date and be the reson behind the company launching multiple iPhones, with cheaper versions not including the same features as the flagship. 19/04/2017: Apple's reliance on curved glass and steel 'may cause iPhone 8 delays' Apple may ditch its plans to include curved glass panels and steel in the next iPhone because of manufacturing delays, a source has told Bloomberg. One design in particular was going to include "symmetrical, slightly curved glass on the front and the back," with a flat OLED screen beneath a curved glass frontage that bends round to meet a cutting edge steel frame. The source explained it's similar to the iPhone 4, which would be a great way to celebrate the phone's 10 year anniversary. However, according to the report, Apple has not managed to source the parts from its suppliers, putting a halt to those potential prototypes. "Apple suppliers have so far struggled to reliably produce heavily curved glass in mass quantities, so the company is more likely to ship the version with more subdued curves," Bloomberg explained in its report. However, the source added that Apple is testing other designs too that could have shorter lead times, such as one with a curve aluminium back rather than glass. 18/04/2017: Leaked pictures show iPhone 8 full-front display Chinese iPhone leakster KK has revealed renders of was it claims are the iPhone 8, showing an edge-to-edge screen, measuring as slightly smaller than previous leaks. The device, according to technical drawings revealed alongside the renders, will measure 137.54mmx 67.54mm, almost exactly matching the dimensions of the iPhone 7. The screen will be 5.768in diagonally, with a 4mm bezel around the sides of the smartphone. Here we go #iphone8 #iphonex or #iphoneedition pic.twitter.com/kxDDOKZ6XM — KK Sneak Leaks (@kksneakleaks) April 17, 2017 Because the device doesn't have much bezel and the screen almost extends to all edges, this means the sensors have been embedded into the screen area, rather than being integrated into a border. Although it's a pretty smart way of designing the device to make it look more streamlined, the design process must have been quite complicated to ensure the screen can still be used where they are situated. However, the renders miss vital features such as the front-facing camera and other features (such as a home button). We can't imagine Apple launching a smartphone without a front facing camera given the popularity of Facetime, raising questions around the legitimacy of these renders. On the back of the device, there's a camera with two lenses, which could help with the company's efforts in augmented reality and 3D video camera capabilities. 12/04/2017: Apple 'is struggling to integrate TouchID into iPhone 8 display' Despite an exciting number of new technologies expected from the iPhone 8, Apple is struggling to integrate it's TouchID fingerprint sensor into the display, according to a report from AppleInsider, citing analysts. "For the 5.8-inch OLED version, the biggest bottleneck remains integrating an under-glass fingerprint sensor into the display,"wrote in a note to investors seen by the publication. "The current yield rate of Apple's in-house AuthenTec solution remains low and AAPL seems unwilling to use other vendors' products." According to Arcuri, Apple has three possible options if they are unable to solve this issue. The first is that Apple could ditch TouchID altogether and rely on facial recognition, though he admits this option is highly unlikely. The second option involves moving the sensor to the back of the smartphone, much like Samsung devices. Lastly, Arcuri suggests that Apple could delay production, but announce the handset with the "iPhone 7s" series. 10/04/2017: UBS predicts that the iPhone 8 will cost less than $1,000 (£805) An investment note from bank UBS suggests that the iPhone 8 could retail at less than $1,000 - the price point previously suggested. Instead of becoming the most expensive iPhone ever, UBS believes the iPhone 8's selling price will be around $692 (£558), according to a report by CNBC. The investment bank added that the sale price of the 64GB iPhone will be between $850 (£685) and $900 (£725). This higher cost could affect Apple's gross margin, which may decline to 38.5% in the fiscal 2018 year, CNBC reported. Competitor Samsung has priced its Galaxy S8 at $720 (£580), which is cheaper than UBS's estimate for the new iPhone. However, the investment bank believes customers will pay a higher price if the hardware is innovative. Many sources seemed to think that the upcoming anniversary edition of the iPhone is going to be priced above $1,000, but UBS thinks this is unlikely as Apple rarely ventures above its competitors' high-end prices. "Apple's top model will be at a display size disadvantage to Samsung's Galaxy S8 Plus. We still think Apple will choose to price its top model relative to Samsung's top model, but remain cautious on how much higher Apple could ultimately go on price given a smaller display," analyst Steven Milunovich wrote, according to the report. 05/04/2017: iPhone 8 flexible OLED panels on order 70 million bendy iPhone 8 displays have apparently been ordered by Apple, supply chain sources have revealed. According to Nikkei Asian Review, Apple has ordered the flexible OLED panels from Samsung, ready for the device's launch in September. The 70 million figure revealed by Nikkei's source is in line with estimates by David Hsieh, senior director at research company IHS Markit. "Apple has ordered 70 million units of OLED panels from Samsung this year, while Samsung is preparing to churn out as many as 95 million for Apple in 2017, in case demand exceeds expectations," he said in a previous report. Samsung will be the sole provider of displays because Apple thinks it has the most advanced technology. As this will be the first time a curved display will be integrated into an iPhone, Apple wants to make sure it uses the best available technology. Samsung would not comment on whether it would be supplying Apple with the screens for the iPhone 8, commenting it does not reveal information about any of its customers' orders. 03/04/2017: Apple to start designing its own GPUs Apple will start designing its own graphics chips for the iPhone within the next two years, according to its UK supplier, whom Apple is cutting ties from. British chipmaker Imagination Technologies develops the GPUs Apple currently uses in its devices. According to Imagination, Apple expects to be producing its own chips in under two years, effectively ending the two companies' long-standing partnership. "Apple has asserted that it has been working on a separate, independent graphics design in order to control its products and will be reducing its future reliance on Imagination's technology," the company said in a statement. Apple has been using Imagination's PowerVR technology in its mobile devices for years, and the Silicon Valley giant is one of the British firm's biggest customers. It makes up more than half of Imagination's revenues, and the company's shares tanked by more than 60% following the announcement. However, Imagination appeared to cast doubt on the notion of whether or not Apple could successfully develop its own GPU independent of Imagination's technology, and suggested that it may consider legal action if it feels Apple has violated its rights. "Apple has not presented any evidence to substantiate its assertion that it will no longer require Imagination's technology, without violating Imagination's patents, intellectual property and confidential information. This evidence has been requested by Imagination but Apple has declined to provide it," Imagination's statement read. "Further, Imagination believes that it would be extremely challenging to design a brand new GPU architecture from basics without infringing its intellectual property rights, accordingly Imagination does not accept Apple's assertions." IT Pro has approached Apple for comment. Release date Apple has always stuck to a September release for its new smartphone flagships, and we have no reason to believe the iPhone 8 will not follow suit. This means we are likely to see a release of the device early in the month, going on sale to the public in late September. Price Given that some models of the iPhone 7 Plus can cost up to £920, it is no surprise that the industry is expecting a $1000+ price point for the iPhone 8. Rumours have suggested that Apple are planning to raise the average prices of the new iPhone range, which would make it the most expensive smartphone Apple has ever made. Rumours also point to three different configurations for the next flagship phone, two of which feature a cheaper to produce LCD screen over the costly OLED variant. This will almost certainly have an affect on final prices. Specs & hardware It's highly likely that the iPhone 8 will launch with iOS 11, but as iOS 10 has only been out a few months, its unclear what features a brand new OS would include. Apple used a quad-core A10 processor in the iPhone 7 range and the company may stick with a quad-core A11 for its next phone. Samsung's activities will not go unnoticed however, as rumours suggest they are planning for an Exynos octa-core chip built using 10nm technology. If true, Apple is unlikely to let itself be out-gunned. While the iPhone 7 was limited to just 2GB RAM, it is very likely that Apple will want to beef up the iPhone 8 to either 3GB or 4GB. Apple may also be about to phase out the 32GB storage option for this generation, according to a recent report by TrendForce, in favour of 64GB and 256GB configurations. Display One of the first rumours to circulate about the iPhone 8 was the inclusion of an all-glass OLED display. What is uncertain is whether this screen will be curved, as one report from the Wall Street Journal claimed it would be, only to be contradicted by the research report by TrendForce citing poor production yield and failed drop test results. What we can say is that this model will be its premium version, and it is very likely that two other models will hit the market at the same time offering cheaper LCD screens. On the face of things this could be seen as a move by Apple to offer greater variety and pricing options for its customers, although what is more probable is that Apple is suffering from a severe supply shortage of OLED screens. The iPhone 8 is also likely to be closer to the iPhone 7 Plus in terms of size, and although the new design will shave off some inches by removing the top and bottom bezels, the actual phone size will remain relatively the same. A number of scanners are set to feature with the new display, including a built in finger print scanner and a new iris scanner for facial recognition. Battery Apple may finally add support for wireless charging with the iPhone 8, following news that Foxconn is researching the technology for Apple devices. What this will look like is unclear, as Apple could build on the technology to provide true wireless charging with 15ft of contactless support. Although there have been no official statements, Energous, the company behind the technology, has stated it is working alongside a larger consumer electronic company planning to release a new product at the end of 2017. The research group itself has received $10 million in investments from Dialog Semiconductor, a company largely affiliated with Apple, according to BGR. 'Ultimate Accessory Connector' (UAC) A new connector type is rumoured to be making its way to iPhone 8 accessories. The UAC, which will feature on all accessories and devices made through Apple's 'Made-for-iPhone' programme, and promises to be an eight-pin connection that is smaller and thinner than USB-C and Lightning. Colours A Chinese supplier recently revealed that the new range of iPhones will feature the same colours as the current models, including Silver, Gold, and Rose Gold, according to a report by Macotakara. Although simply an uncorroborated report at this stage, the typically reliable source also pointed to a replacement to the current Space Grey option, potentially with a Deep Blue, Space Black, or a Deep Red.

A filing Apple made with the California Department of Motor Vehicles has disclosed the names of the Apple engineers who are leading the company’s self-driving car efforts. By Rex Crum | rcrum@bayareanewsgroup.com | PUBLISHED: April 25, 2017 at 4:04 pm | UPDATED: April 25, 2017 at 4:04 pm Top of the Order:   So, THAT’s Who’s Behind the Wheel: Well, sort of, anyway. Because we are talking about self-driving cars here. In this case, we’re talking about self-driving cars and Apple, a company so notorious for privacy that it’s amazing it even admitted it was building its 2.8 million-square-foot Apple Park campus, even when drones could buzz the place and take photos of it from on high.

And why not? The company is always looking for the next big thing. And with everyone from Google to Uber (which is also working on flying cars) and Nvidia getting in on the self-driving car game in some fashion, it should come as no surprise that Apple would want a piece of that action. What it certainly didn’t want was for the names of those who are helping Apple build a self-driving car to become public, at least not until Apple was good and ready to do so. But, thanks to the California Department of Motor Vehicles, we all now know who’s behind Apple’s self-driving car program. And, in a humorous twist on the old joke: In many cases, you do need to be a rocket scientist to build one of Apple’s autonomous cars. Business Insider reported that, courtesy of a public records request, it got ahold of DMV documents that show who Apple has hired for its self-driving car initiative. The team includes Shilpa Gulati, a former NASA engineer who helped the space agency develop a self-driving underwater vehicle that could be used to investigate other planetary bodies; former Tesla engineer David Gadda; Paul Hebert, a former engineer of robotics at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory; David Rosas, who holds a doctorate in control systems; as well as Apple engineers Victor Hwang and Jeremy Ma, both of whom also used to work on robotics at the JPL. Some of the team members are described as “autonomous vehicle driver/engineers” in the documentation. The reason why the DMV had all the previously top-secret names of Apple’s self-driving car team members was because the company had to file with the department to get permits for testing self-driving cars on California roads. Now, the DMV will know where to send the self-driving car’s annual license-tab fee notices. Middle Innings: Onward and Upward: It was a milestone day for the Nasdaq Composite Index on Tuesday, as the tech-heavy stock market gauge rose past the 6,000-point mark for the first time. By the time the stock market closed, the Nasdaq had gained 0.7 percent to end the day at 6,025.49. Investors have rallied around stocks this year, as mostly upbeat earnings reports, and a pledge by President Donald Trump to cut corporate tax rates, have helped boost company share prices. Among the big-name Bay Area businesses that make up the Nasdaq are Apple (which at almost 12 percent of the Nasdaq’s weighting is the index’s single-largest component), Facebook, Google parent company Alphabet, Cisco Systems and Intel. Cashing Out: Sometimes, you actually do win for losing. And it looks like Yahoo Chief Executive Marissa Mayer is going to win big whenever she loses her job at the one-time internet kingpin. A regulatory filing on Monday said if, and most likely when, Mayer leaves Yahoo after Verizon completes its $4.5 billion acquisition of the company, she will head out the door with $186 million in compensation, mostly in the form of Yahoo shares, stock options and restricted-stock units. If your jaw is still on the floor after reading that, don’t feel bad. It kind of makes the $25 million the San Francisco 49ers owed head coach Chip Kelly after the team fired him following its 2-14 season last year look like a pretty good deal, in retrospect. Bottom of the Lineup: Here’s a look at how some leading Silicon Valley stocks did Tuesday. Movin’ on Up: Netflix shares climbed 6 percent to close at $152.16 after the company said it reached a deal to stream original content in China via a licensing deal with iQiyi.com, one of China’s biggest video-streaming services. Gains also came from Aviat Networks, Ultra Clean Holdings, Genomic Health and Nektar Therapeutics. In the Red: Decliners included Rocket Fuel, Rambus, Cadence Design Systems, 8×8 and Sanmina. The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite Index, as stated earlier, rose 0.7 percent to a record-high close of 6,025.49. The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed by 1.1 percent to 20,996.12. And the broad-based Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 0.6 percent to finish the day at 2,388.61. Quote of the Day: “It’s a completely untapped market with huge opportunity.” — Bradley Tusk, CEO and founder of Tusk Ventures. Tusk, who is an investor in San Francisco-based marijuana-delivery company Eaze, was speaking about how venture capital firms are looking more and more at investing in the pot industry.

TWITTER Taiwanese writer-director Giddens Ko takes a radical detour from his romantic comedy hit debut into dark-comedy/high-school-horror territory. Who are the real monsters among us? That’s the question lurking at the heart of writer and director Giddens Ko’s sophomore effort, mon mon mon MONSTERS, which closes this year’s Hong Kong International Film Festival. Taking a radical departure from his 2011 romantic high school dramedy You Are the Apple of My Eye (a, ahem, monster hit), mon mon mon MONSTERS is as dark, violent and nihilistic as Apple was bright, fluffy and bittersweet. Inspired by Mikael Hafstrom’s Evil, MONSTERS is far more literal in its horror aspirations, replacing Hafstrom’s victimized younger students with a supernatural creature, and the ineffective Nazi-ish teachers with ineffective Buddhist ones. What the films do share is a lack of greater insight into the nature and source of violence and bullying. Ko’s genre-melding film is nonetheless compulsively watchable, with flashes of dark, pithy comedy that carry it past its lumpier parts. MONSTERS’ charming young cast and Ko’s grasp of striking visuals and ceaselessly current thematic undertones should help the film fare well in Taiwan upon its summertime release, and in most of Asia. A host of diverse festivals — first and foremost Asia-focused and genre events — will line up to check this out. The existence of the film’s titular monsters is never ambiguous, as Ko begins the action in one of Taipei’s myriad, dank underground passages, where a homeless man is descended upon by a pair of vampiric, CHUD-like quasi-zombies. It’s just a taste of the gore to come. The next morning in a local high school, straight-A student Lin Shu-wei (Deng Yu-Kai) is the target for the class bullies, subjected to all manner of in-class humiliations — with the blessing of his passive, completely useless teacher Ms. Li (Carolyn Chen) — for stealing some money. Naturally he didn’t do it, and was framed for the petty theft by the head bully, the sadistic, handsome Ren-Hao (Kent Tsai of HBO Asia original series The Teenage Psychic). After getting what he believes is evidence of his innocence, Ms. Li turns the tables and convinces Lin he should repent for his actions anyway and assigns him to community service, aided by Ren-Hao and his mates, Guo-Feng (Lai Jun-Cheng) and Wei-Zhu (Tao Bo-Meng). During their community service, a sort of meals-on-wheels for the elderly, the newly formed gang abuses the seniors they’re supposed to be helping in heinous ways, complete with gleeful selfies. Ko lays it on thick: These kids are reprehensible, and the fundamentally sweet, previously meek Lin soon comes to enjoy the power he finds himself wielding with his new “friends.” After robbing a war veteran late one night (they think there’s gold in an old suitcase, a McGuffin if ever there was one), they stumble upon the monsters, and when the younger (Lin Pei-Hsin) gives chase, she’s hit by a car. They take her to their hangout, where things quickly spiral into violence and outright torture — for her. By making everyone in the story such utter slime, Ko doesn’t have to stretch much to make his point: The real monsters are Lin and Ren-Hao, the former fully understanding his descent into viciousness and choosing to do nothing about it, the latter finally finding a punching bag of his own to unleash his frustrations on. Ko the director does a nice job of creating a separate, almost surreal world for the kids to exist in outside of school, the abandoned hideaway suitably gonzo for their cruel experiments. It's a world governed by its own bizarre moral code and pecking order. But Ko the writer never offers up more than passing suggestions for Ren-Hao’s rage (an absentee father may be a factor), and Lin’s family, his background and the root of his vanishing goodness are never illuminated. But the film does have a chilling cloud of rage hanging over it stemming from a vivid sense of retribution — a sense of “My turn!” that’s eerily resonant these days. Things pick up in the third act when the monster’s older sister (Eugenie Liu) begins a rampage while looking for her missing sibling and Ren-Hao (helped along by his smart, mean-girl girlfriend) finds a vengeful use for his hostage. It starts a bloody war of attrition that ends in tragedy, just not for the characters we’d expect it for; Ko makes it hard to care for any of the kids. The cocktail of dark comedy and violence muddles the message on occasion, but largely works. Inspired moments, like when the boys use a portrait of Chiang Kai-shek as a weapon and the elder monster’s visible confusion when an angry neighbor interrupts one of her feasts, couch others of dead seriousness, with Lin’s final, drastic effort to break the cycle leaving an aftertaste of hopelessness. Though they do little more than grunt and shriek, Liu and Pei manage to be empathetic and, ultimately, quite heartbreaking. Visually and technically, Ko owes a debt to the J-horror wave of the 1990s (Ring in particular), but he’s built a suitably grim palette for MONSTERS, with Chou Yi-Hsien’s (Love Off the Cuff) claustrophobic images and Pao Cheng-Hsun and Huang Mei-Cing’s splattery special effects serving the story perfectly.

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish Alleged iPhone 8 Geekbench Benchmark Scores Surface [Updated] By Tyler Lee on 04/25/2017 16:36 PDT Update – 9to5Mac has confirmed with Geekbench company’s founder that the screenshot has been doctored and is fake. When it comes to marketing the iPhone, Apple tends to stay away from the technicals and usually prefers marketing the phone’s features and the lifestyle associated with it. This is why sometimes the iPhone is ridiculed due to its perceived low specs compared to Android. However as we have seen in the past, that’s hardly true. Apple’s iPhone 7 with its A10 chipset has been shown to blow away the competition even in more recent times, and it looks like the A11 will be no different. According to a sighting, it seems that Apple’s iPhone 8 was recently spotted on Geekbench where it managed to clock a single-core score of 4,537 and a multi-core score of 8,975. To give you guys some perspective, the single-core score is already 30% better than that of the iPhone 7, and 58% better in multi-core score than its predecessor. As for the competition, Samsung’s Galaxy S8 only managed to score 1,945 for single and 6,338 for multi. That being said, benchmark scores are just one way to measure a phone’s performance and it might not necessarily reflect real-life usage. There could be other features that might appeal to you more than just power, like display size, resolution, camera quality, operating system features, and so on, but so far on paper and assuming this Geekbench sighting is legit, the iPhone 8 could very well be blowing the competition out of the water already.

 Apple might compete with SpaceX in an unexpected business Evan Niu, The Motley Fool Apr. 25, 2017, 6:44 PM 2,389 facebook linkedin twitter email print A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket lifting off. Joe Skipper/Reuters Investors already know that Apple is actively searching for its next big hit, be it autonomous electric cars, augmented reality, or a toaster-refrigerator. There's now a clue of another possible idea floating around Cupertino: space internet. Bloomberg reported on Friday that Apple has poached two high-level Alphabet executives that worked on satellite and spacecraft projects for Google, John Fenwick and Michael Trela. Trela served as Google's head of satellite engineering from August 2014 to March 2017, according to his LinkedIn profile. Fenwick was Google's head of spacecraft operations over the same time frame, according to his LinkedIn profile. Neither executive's profile has been updated to mention Apple. Apple may have "potential interest in space" The report notes that aerospace giant Boeing has expressed interest in pursuing space internet with a network of 1,000 satellites, saying that Boeing has held talks with Apple as a potential investor and partner. Apple may in fact be helping fund the project, according to Bloomberg, citing a blog post from satellite and telecom consultant Tim Farrar, but Apple's involvement beyond that is unclear. Farrar wrote last month, "Boeing has also indicated to these people that it does not need export credit funding for the project, which supports the idea that this project is backed by a deep pocketed US entity." After ruling out other tech giants that have expressed extraterrestrial interest, Farrar concludes, "That only leaves Apple as never having discussed publicly its potential interest in space." Apple does have the deepest pockets of any company on Earth, after all. Tim Cook vs. Elon Musk This all comes a few months after The Wall Street Journal got ahold of leaked financials for Elon Musk's SpaceX, which is privately held. Of course, SpaceX's primary mission is to achieve full and rapid reusability of rockets in order to realize massive reductions in the cost of space travel, which the company hopes will pave the way for subsequent colonization of Mars. The business is currently built on launch contracts, but the internal information that was obtained shows that SpaceX has lofty ambitions for creating a satellite internet business within a matter of years, potentially starting as early as 2019. SpaceX's projections estimate that the service could garner 40 million subscribers and generate over $30 billion in revenue by 2025, according to the report. In contrast, the launch business is only expected to bring in $5 billion in sales that year, meaning that SpaceX believes that there's much more financial opportunity in beaming space internet down to Earth than launching reusable rockets. Operating income is forecast between $20 billion and $25 billion in 2025, which would largely be driven by the new business. The company had previously disclosed plans to launch over 4,400 satellites into low-Earth orbit to deliver low-latency internet from space, but had not mentioned financial expectations. Apple has been wanting to grow services revenue People have been dreaming of space internet for over a decade, and there have been many casualties over the years. But as things tend to go in technology, things change rapidly over time, and that rate of change only accelerates. Falling costs have opened up the potential for a new wave of space entrepreneurs; start-up OneWeb raised $1.2 billion last year to build and launch a space internet network. It's entirely possible that Apple has something else in mind, but given the company's heavy emphasis on services in recent quarters, it seems conceivable that Apple sees potential in building a strong base of recurring revenue from a literal moonshot like space internet. However, even if you accept SpaceX's forecast, $30 billion still isn't a game changer on Apple's income statement, although it would be a welcome addition to the services segment (currently a $25 billion business). There would immense costs associated with building such a constellation, but the Mac maker is currently sitting on the most cash that it's ever had ($246 billion at last count, before factoring in debt). Space internet revenue also wouldn't have as high of margins compared to Apple's terrestrial services, given these costs. Still, I'm hoping that Apple one day announces "the most extraterrestrial service we've ever made." 10 stocks we like better than Apple When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.* David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now… and Apple wasn't one of them!

The sale, which ends on 26 April, offers direct price cuts, cashbacks, specific bank offers and exchange offers on Apple products.

Tuesday, April 25, 2017 [Tweets] [Favorites] Apple Cuts App and IAP Affiliate Commissions John Voorhees (Hacker News, MacRumors): Today, Apple announced that it is reducing the commissions it pays on apps and In-App Purchases from 7% to 2.5% effective May 1st. The iTunes Affiliate Program pays a commission from Apple’s portion of the sale of apps and other media when a purchase is made with a link that contains the affiliate credentials of a member of the program. Anyone can join, but the Affiliate Program is used heavily by websites that cover media sold by Apple and app developers. Via John Gruber (tweet): Everything about this strikes me as strange, including the mere one week notice and the severity of the cut. It’s not a small reduction — it’s effectively been cut by two thirds. Note too that Apple is only reducing the affiliate commission for apps and in-app purchases — movies, music, and books are all still at 7 percent. Brett Terpstra: I’m guessing some sites you read are going to be showing you a few more ads. Some may shut down completely. I won’t be one of them, but I’ll be going out to eat less often until I replace the revenue. Michael Love: If your goal is to get more people into your ecosystem then it’s kind of counterproductive to pay them less $ for linking to you. If they’re dropping % simply to make a little bit more Services revenue we may truly be entering the no-more-free-soda-at-Microsoft phase. It sure seems like a bean counter decision. Some are speculating that it will make sense in light of a forthcoming drastic reduction to Apple’s 30% cut from developers. But if that were the case, you’d think Apple would lead with the good news.

Tuesday, April 25, 2017 [Tweets] [Favorites] How Apple Won Silicon Rene Ritchie (via John Gruber): The Apple A10 Fusion system-on-a-chip (SOC) in iPhone 7 mops the floor with both the Samsung Exynos 8895 and Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 found in the Galaxy S8 when it comes to single threaded operations. […] Apple’s platform technologies team doesn’t have to worry about being hobbled or constrained in any way — all they have to do is run iOS and iOS apps faster than anything else on the planet. That’s their only customer. It makes for an incredibly appealing work environment for legends of the industry and the best and brightest new minds, a startling number of whom have now found a home at Apple. […] Conversely, Apple’s silicon team also doesn’t have to carry the baggage of competing vendors and devices. For example, Apple A10 doesn’t have to support Microsoft’s Direct X. It only and exactly has to support Apple’s specific technologies and implementations. My iPhone SE, almost two-year-old technology, still feels pretty fast. The slowest parts for me are Touch ID and the cell network, neither of which is limited by the processor. So flip side of this story is that Apple will need more than faster processors now to entice people to upgrade their phones. Alas, on the Mac it’s the opposite story: I feel like I need more speed but that it’s simply not available.

Here’s what works, what doesn’t, and what still needs to change. By Emily Bary April 25, 2017 4:57 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large The Apple Watch turned 2 this week. The first model launched on April 24, 2015. Illustration: Pixabay Time has flown by since Apple released its watch in April 2015. But for a product that turned two yesterday, the Apple Watch feels stubbornly stuck in its infancy -- it’s a cute product without the skills to thrive on its own.

I’ve been using an Apple Watch from the start, back when the colors were more limited and you had to pay $10,000 or more for a gold-colored watch. Since then, I’ve lost a watch, amassed a sizable watch-band collection, and upgraded to the latest model. I still wear the device every day. Apple has made improvements along the way. The Series 2 model, released last fall, is faster than the original. It’s waterproof and tracks your progress via its own GPS chip. You can technically leave your phone at home now. Recent operating-system upgrades have also made necessary improvements. We like the ability to scribble a text reply, for instance, which seems less obnoxious (and less error-prone) than dictating a reply. The original appeal remains, as well. You get a quick tap on your wrist with every text message (that begins to feel strangely natural after a few weeks). You can set activity goals and cheer your watch-wearing friends on as they accomplish their own. You can swap out bands easily to get a new look -- just make sure to buy the cheaper third-party models from Amazon. And you can view the time, temperature, and moon phase -- as well as the next event on your calendar -- with just one quick glance. But still, the watch remains a niche product, and it’s hard to justify the purchase for all but the most dedicated Apple fans. Here are some ways the watch could expand its appeal. Better battery life: You won’t be able to make it through two full days of Apple Watch use on a single charge, and that’s a problem. Rival companies make smartwatches that can last a week or longer in between charges. Those products allow you to take advantage of third-party sleep tracking apps and generally give you more flexibility. More from Barron’s Next Our Smartphone Priorities Are All Messed Up The One Number That Shows Trouble At Verizon Here’s One Less Reason to Pay for Apple Music An always-on screen: As it stands, the Apple Watch face only lights up when you raise your wrist to look at the screen or tap on the device. And there’s still a short lag even after your raise your watch. No one should have to wait for the time. This is a battery-saving measure, but the watch’s battery doesn’t last long enough anyway. Battery life could be Apple’s greatest challenge with the watch. The small space doesn’t allow for much battery. Maybe the company needs to rethink its screen; an e-ink model, like the screen used in Amazon’s Kindle, would allow for far more battery. Garmin uses a type of e-ink display in its smartwatches and they last for a week or more. A slimmer case: The Apple Watch Series 2 is actually heavier than the earlier version. Apple needs to find a way to make the watch lighter and less bulky. That’s another area where competitors have an edge. Here, though, Apple is probably working against the physics required for better battery life. Standalone functionality: Most of what you want to do with the Apple Watch can only be done while your iPhone is nearby. Yes, you can go on runs with GPS and listen to (some) music via Bluetooth while your phone hangs behind, but you can’t send or receive messages on the go without the phone in your pocket. We hope the next version of the Apple Watch will have wireless capabilities built in. This would likely make the device more useful to people. Instead of being somewhat redundant for iPhone users, it could become a substitute when they don’t want to carry their phone around with them on quick trips around the neighborhood. A Spotify app: So far, everything but Apple Music has been handcuffed on the Apple Watch. That leaves out the 50 million or so folks that pay for Spotify. But that looks like it might finally change. A third-party developer is working with the streaming service to bring a Spotify app to the Apple Watch at some point in the near future. Runs would get a lot better with Spotify playlists that are stored and played directly on the watch. Apps that work: Apple Watch apps don’t get much love from developers. The apps are often slow and glitchy. And it’s hard to blame the developers given the relatively small base of watch users. Apple needs to kick off an iPhone-like cycle. A better product leads to more users, which means better apps. Finally, we’d like to see Apple give more detail about the watch business. The company has yet to break out sales, so we’re all guessing to some degree about the importance of the business. Providing detail on watch sales would be a vote of confidence about the watch’s future.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: AlHasan Husni Why a delayed iPhone 8 launch would make sense Chris Mills @chrisfmills April 25th, 2017 at 5:19 PM Share Tweet For the last seven or eight years, Apple has followed a boring and predictable pattern. Every fall, a series of Apple execs are wheeled on stage in California to explain why the old iPhone is toast, the new iPhone is here, and you have to start waiting in line RIGHT NOW to go buy one. It’s a well-oiled and efficient process: the phone is shown on stage first; a week later, the first reviews come out from insiders, just to keep excitement up; one week after that, pre-orders arrive and stock arrives in stores. But for the launch of the iPhone 8, we might have to go outside our comfort zone. Don't Miss: Behold: This Galaxy Note 8 blows the Galaxy S8 out of the water A number of reports are now suggesting that the iPhone 8 will be shown off in September, as per schedule, but won’t be available until 2018. The delay is being blamed on manufacturing delays or difficulties with some of the new technologies expected to debut in the phone, all of which is likely. But it could be something much simpler. The iPhone 8 (or iPhone X, or iPhone Edition) is widely expected to be a major change from what’s come before, and Apple actually has tradition of doing things a little differently for game-changing products. Think back to the launch of the original iPhone. Steve Jobs went up on stage on January 9th, 2007, and showed off the iPhone to the world. But it wasn’t until June of that year that it actually went on sale, far outside Apple’s normal two-week turnaround time. Then there was the Apple Watch. It was Tim Cook’s first big new product release, and he chose to show it off at Apple’s flagship event in September 2014. It didn’t hit shelves until April 2015, giving the public six months to work themselves into a frenzy over Apple’s first wearable. So if there is a major delay between the iPhone 8 being shown off, and the phone going on sale, I don’t think it’s the end of the world. It will superficially hit Apple’s bottom line, as it will have to wait until 2018 to get a major bump from iPhone 8 sales. But for the people who actually buy the phone, a delay may turn out to be good. It will give Apple time to perfect features, rather than launching a phone with unforeseen hardware problems (read: the iPhone 4’s Antennagate), or with hardware features that require a software update to work, like the Portrait Mode on last year’s iPhone 7 Plus. Better, a delay will hopefully mean developers have months to work on iOS 11. That means no buggy apps on launch, and hopefully third-party devs will have time to take advantage of new features on the iPhone 8. It’s taken months for apps to adapt to the TouchBar on the new MacBooks, for example, and my banking app only recently updated to let me use Touch ID. The iPhone 8 launch will be much better for everyone involved if the phone hits the ground running, ready to go.

Though truth be told, one of Apple's other stores in Dubai was actually part of the pilot program along with San Francisco, New York and New Regent Street in London.   According to Dubai's Gulf News, "Journalists were given a sneak preview of the 495th Apple store at the Dubai Mall on Tuesday evening.   Dubai's other the two malls have already attracted four million visitors in just 18 months, Wendy Beckman, senior director for Apple Retail EMEA, told journalists."   Apple's Angela Ahrendts told the press that "Today at Apple" will provide iPhone users interested in photography with six 'how To' sessions that cover shooting, organizing, editing, and more.   Ahrendts further noted that "more advanced photographers can join experiential Photo Walks that leave the store to dive into techniques including light and shadow, portraits and storytelling. Going further, a Photo Lab features accomplished photographers on topics such as capturing candids, building a brand on social media or simply sharing their perspective."

Search Primary Menu Skip to content Wind Energy Other renewables Grids Electric Vehicle System Operator Batteries Pumping system OpEd Español Search for: Evwind, News Menu, Uncategorized, Wind Energy, wind energy Apple finally jumps on the wind power bandwagon April 25, 2017 reve Over the past few months, we’ve seen big wind energy investments from the likes of GM, Facebook, Home Depot and others. But one of the world’s largest companies, and leading proponents of doing business using 100 percent renewable energy, has been conspicuously absent: Apple. That finally changed this week. Apple just announced it has signed a power purchase agreement (PPA) to buy wind energy from a soon-to-be-built Oregon wind farm. It will power an in-state data center about 130 miles away from the wind farm, and Apple says the project is its largest renewable energy investment to date. Apple plans to hit its 100 percent renewable energy goal by sourcing renewables through a combination of direct project ownership and long-term contracts with new renewable energy projects, and preferably from projects in the same state as their facilities. When it can’t do either of those, it procures renewable energy from “newer projects in nearby markets… through available utility green energy programs… or [through] strong renewable energy credits (RECs) tied to recently constructed renewable energy projects.” In 2016, Fortune 500 companies and other non-utility customers signed 39 percent of the capacity contracted through wind PPAs, and their strong interest in wind has continued into 2017. Companies like Apple choose to power their operations using renewables like wind not just because it’s good for the environment, but also because it helps their bottom lines. “This pursuit of renewable energy benefits our customers and communities through cleaner air while strengthening our business through lower and more stable energy costs,” said GM Chairwoman and CEO Mary Barra, speaking about her company’s 100 percent renewable pledge.

Apple is lowering affiliate payouts from apps and their in-app purchases to less than half of the original commission rate. For many, this means a negative impact to yet another revenue stream. Today’s change sees the 7% commission rate, drop down to 2.5%. This reduction will impact a lot of those on the affiliate program. Previously, the 2.5% commission rate only applied to the Japan store for apps and in-app purchases. This change brings the rate down to 2.5% across the globe. The lower rate only applies to apps and in-app purchases; content like music, movies, and books are unaffected and will remain at the 7% rate. Updates on Commissions Starting on May 1st 2017, commissions for all app and in-app content will be reduced from 7% to 2.5% globally. All other content types (music, movies, books, and TV) will remain at the current 7% commission rate in all markets. We will also continue to pay affiliate commissions on Apple Music memberships so there are many ways to earn commissions with the program. Apple announced via an Affiliate Program email that it is cutting affiliate commissions on apps and in-app content from 7% to 2.5% May 1st. — Blink (@_blinkapp) April 24, 2017 The other updates shared today further clarify commission rates for those on the program and more information on Affiliate Resources as a whole.

If the allegations contained in a New York Times article hold water it might now be more a question of which annoyed parties will be first in the queue to answer in the affirmative. Reportedly, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick (pictured) visited Apple’s Infinite Loop HQ in early 2015 to be told off in person by Apple chief executive Tim Cook for “secretly identifying and tagging” iPhones that had installed the Uber app in attempt to detect service fraud by the company’s drivers in China. The tagging is described as “fingerprinting”, that is using the Uber app to plant something on the iPhone that couldn’t be erased, even potentially when the app was removed and the device refreshed to factory settings. Uber would always know it had encountered that iPhone before. Problem one: Apple prohibits this behaviour, which is why Cook is said to have threatened to remove Uber from its app store. Problem two: Uber attempted to hide what it was doing from Apple by “geofencing” or obscuring its app code from anyone studying it from the location of within Apple’s Cupertino HQ. Says the NYT story: Mr Kalanick was shaken by Mr Cook’s scolding, according to a person who saw him after the meeting. So much for Tim Cook and Apple’s ire. What about the privacy implications for iPhone users? And what about Android? Sophos Home Free home computer security software for all the family Learn More Terms like “fingerprinting” and “tracking” need careful qualification, because they are often used quite loosely. The former usually refers to ways of identifying a device, the latter to profiling a user. Internet users are tracked in all sorts of ways, by advertisers, ISPs and app makers. However, companies are not supposed to relate this data to a real person without their explicit consent, without which it becomes a privacy concern. On that score, Uber now says: We absolutely do not track individual users or their location if they’ve deleted the app. But it does still appear to track devices for anti-fraud purposes: Being able to recognize known bad actors when they try to get back on to our network is an important security measure for both Uber and our users. It’s not clear whether the way it does this is different than it was when Apple expressed its unhappiness in 2015. Nor does it enlighten us about Android devices, although if anti-fraud is the motivation, then not including Android would be illogical. In a telling aside, the NYT story mentions a company called Unroll.me, a service for un-subscribing from mailing lists and newsletters. At some point, Uber started buying data from Unroll.me on how many customers of rival Lyft were ditching the app, culled from analysis of their inbox emails the company’s CEO now regrets. While the data was anonymised, it reinforces the growing sense that when it comes to users, Silicon Valley knows few limits.  Nobody was any the wiser about this – or Uber’s tagging of iPhones – until a newspaper wrote about it. As usual, beyond the PR statements and the lawyerly T&Cs, the customers are the last to be told what is really happening on their expensive smartphones.

Companies who violate the privacy of their users of former users deserve to be put out of business. Profit is no excuse for underhanded behavior. It’s time people started taking a firm stand against unethical companies. Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Enter your comment here...

He did foundational work in ontology engineering and is well known for his definition of ontologies in the context of artificial intelligence. He's better known to Apple fans as the co-founder of Siri Inc that Apple acquired in 2010. One of the earliest patents from Gruber for Apple regarding Siri and Active Ontology dates back to 2010. One of the key patent figures is presented below. Gruber spoke today at TED2017 being held in Vancouver, Canada.     Tom Gruber asked the audience, "How smart can our machines make us? What's the purpose of artificial intelligence? Is it to make machines intelligent, so they can do automated tasks we don't want to do, beat us at complex games like chess and Go and, perhaps, develop superintelligence and become our overlords? No, says Gruber — instead of competing with us, AI should augment and collaborate with us." Gruber added that "Superintelligence should give us superhuman abilities."   Taking us back 30 years to the first intelligent assistant he created, which helped a cerebral palsy patient communicate, to Siri, which helps us do everything from navigate cities to answer complex questions, Gruber explained his vision for "humanistic AI" — machines designed to meet human needs by collaborating with and augmenting us. Gruber invites us into a future where superintelligent AI can augment our memories and help us remember the name of everyone we've ever met, every song we've ever heard and everything we've ever read.   Gruber further noted that "We have a choice in how we use this powerful tech. We can use it to compete with us or to collaborate with us — to overcome our limitations and help us do what we want to do, only better. Every time a machine gets smarter, we get smarter."   Gruber believes that AI could one day play a role to assist those with dementia and Alzheimer's be able to retain more memories so that those afflicted could have a life of dignitiy and connection instead of a life of isolation.   When Grubers full TED talk is publicly made available, we'll post a follow-up report in the coming months.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 25 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman 5 Reasons Why You Should Not Buy The iPhone 8 Silicon Valley, April 25, 2017 – New reports may change what will be different about the iPhone 8, but incoming reports all seem to be pretty in line among insiders. While it does seem that the iPhone 8 may be in for some interesting changes based on the leaks and reports, it seems highly unlikely that the price of the iPhone 8 will reflect the technology it possesses. Here are 5 reasons why you should NOT buy the iPhone 8 that might give you a better idea of what to expect from the new Apple smartphone. 1) The Price The latest reports suggest that Apple’s next device will be its most expensive yet, exceeding the $1,000 mark for the first time. Apple products are not exactly known for being cheap. When the company launched its ‚budget’ iPhone 5c in 2013, it still cost $549. 2) The Camera ​In March of 2017 it was reported that Apple is struggling to procure 3D camera for the iPhone 8 as it would affect release by “months”. This suggests that one of the iPhone 8’s most highly-anticipated features may fail to materialize. If you were hoping that the next version of Apple’s iPhone was going to feature a dual-lens camera, you may be disappointed, as well. According to a KGI analyst report, Apple’s dual-camera system may not be an entry level feature for the iPhone 8, rather it may be reserved as an upgrade to the more expensive Pro model. 3) Wireless charging It seems likely that Apple will finally make wireless charging a standard of the iPhone. This feature is a long-awaited addition… and yet, you don’t need to wait for the iPhone 8 to do this. There is already technology that enables you to wireless charge your iPhone 4,5,6, or 7. Great news for users that already have an iPhone and don’t opt for the costly iPhone 8. Learn more on facebook at statictab.com/too6vrw 4) Display It was being widely reported that the iPhone 8 would feature a curved OLED display. It turns out, no curve after all. According to a report from March 12, 2017 the iPhone 8 will use a flat display on all models, rather than the curved screen we’d been expecting to feature on the top-end iPhone 8 variant. According to a new report from IHS Markit, the forth-coming iPhone will have a flat display, more closely resembling the new LG G6. 5) Design After much anticipation and excitement, Apple will be revolutionizing smartphone design by… wait for it… going back to the design they used on the iPhone 4. The next-generation iPhone is expected to feature a design using two reinforced glass panes and a metal frame in the middle. Like the iPhone 4S. As of January 10, reports confirm that a US firm will supply stainless steel frame components for Apple’s 2017 flagship. Stainless steel will potentially make the iPhone 8 more durable than recent aluminium-framed models, but it will also be more expensive to produce, a cost that is sure to be passed on to consumers. If you are a fan of the OLED display and you would like a slightly larger screen, you should probably wait for the 8. But aside from that, it doesn’t look like it going to be worth the leap from the iPhone models currently out. I would recommend hanging around for whatever 2018 brings. If wireless charging is what you are excited about, you can literally buy a kit to wireless charge your current iPhone model. An article on how to wireless charge your iPhone is at statictab.com/too6vrw Essentially, the iPhone 8 series will look considerably different than the iPhone 6 or 7,which remains a capable smartphone by all standards. If you have an iPhone already, you will probably be comfortable sticking with your current model. The incremental upgrades in technology over the existing iPhones doesn’t seem to justify the inflated price of the iPhone 8.

Lightning port for syncing and wired headphones. On-screen battery indicator. Cons Not a ton of battery capacity for the price. No power button. Bottom Line Apple's Smart Battery Case for the iPhone 7 has a pleasant, grippy feel, a Lightning port, and an on-screen battery indicator, but you don't get a lot extra juice for the price. By Ajay Kumar Apple's $99 Smart Battery Case for the iPhone 7 looks similar to the iPhone 6/6s model that came before it, but features a decent bump in battery capacity (to 2,365mAh) and altered port cutouts. It remains a unique-looking case with a pleasant, grippy feel, and a solid choice for Apple fans, as well as anyone else who values a slim case that leaves their Lightning port easily accessible. If you're looking for as much extra power as possible, however, Apple's option falls short of less expensive alternatives like the ZeroLemon Slim Juicer. //Compare Similar Products Compare ZeroLemon Slim Juicer (for iPhone 7)   %displayPrice%%seller% Anker PowerCore Case 2200 (for iPhone 7)   %displayPrice%%seller% Trianium Atomic Pro (for iPhone 7)   %displayPrice%%seller% Mophie Hold Force PowerStation Plus Mini (for iPhone 7)   %displayPrice%%seller% Flux Battery Case (for iPhone 7)   %displayPrice%%seller% Anker PowerCore 10000 With Quick Charge 3.0   %displayPrice%%seller% Mophie Juice Pack Air (for iPhone 7)   %displayPrice%%seller% Design and Features If you've seen the original, the Smart Battery Case doesn't surprise in the design department. It's the same silicone design in black, red, and white color options. There's a distinct battery bump on the back, emblazoned with an Apple logo in the middle. The inside of the case is lined with a soft microfiber to help cushion your phone from bumps and drops. The outside of the case is nicely grippy and comfortable to hold. To get your phone in or out, all you have to do is bend back one of the top corners. The case measures in at 5.8 by 2.7 by 0.6 inches (HWD) and weighs 3.7 ounces. It falls right between the hefty ZeroLemon Slim Juicer (6.0 by 2.8 by 0.6 inches, 5.3 ounces) and lighter options like the Anker PowerCore 2200 (5.6 by 2.8 by 0.6 inches, 2.2 ounces) and Flux Battery Case (5.5 by 2.7 by 0.4 inches, 2.0 ounces). It's easy to reach across with one hand. The iPhone 7 lacks a headphone jack, so there's no cutout for one here, unlike the previous Smart Battery Case. The rear camera is also larger, so there's a bigger cutout to accommodate it. There are two front-facing speaker grilles to redirect sound from the bottom of your phone, and a built-in Lightning port that supports pass-through charging and syncing. It also lets you use wired headphones without having to remove your phone from the case. Aside from the pronounced battery hump, another way the Smart Battery Case differs from many others is its lack of a power button. The case begins charging automatically as soon as you slip your iPhone in it, keeping it constantly topped up for as long as the juice lasts. In a way, it's a nice feature because you don't have to fiddle with any buttons or cables; you can just slip the case on and forget about it. But it also means you can't turn off the flow of juice when you don't need it, and save it for later, when you do. There's no external LED indicator—instead there's one on the inside of the case. It appears yellow when charging and green when fully charged. Otherwise, if you want to check battery status, you need to wake your phone and drag down the notification pane or swipe to the left to check the battery widget. This is the only case that integrates directly with the iPhone, and as such it provides a much more precise measure of battery life than a few external LEDs. Performance and Conclusions The 2,365mAh Smart Battery Case gave our iPhone 7 an additional 3 hours, 28 minutes of battery life while streaming full-screen video over LTE at maximum brightness. That's right in line with the 2,525mAh Mophie Juice Pack Air (3 hours, 49 minutes) and the 2,200mAh PowerCore (3 hours, 27 minutes). It'll keep you running for longer than the Flux's 1,500mAh cell (2 hours, 14 minutes), but can't come close to matching the 4,000mAh Slim Juicer (5 hours, 48 minutes). Apple's Smart Battery Case has several advantages over competitors, including an on-screen battery indicator and a built-in Lightning port. But for the price, it doesn't add any truly useful features like the Juice Pack Air (wireless charging, a magnetic back for compatible mounts), and it doesn't provide as much battery life as cases like the Slim Juicer. The Smart Battery Case is a solid choice if you're a fan of its quirky design, or simply like to see that Apple logo on the back of your phone. Shopping around, however, will get you more battery life for the price. And if you don't want to deal with the bulk of a battery case at all, it's worth considering an external backup battery like the Anker PowerCore 10000.

Skip to content 512 Pixels About Projects Sponsor Book → RSS → ‘Today at Apple’ to Bring New Retail Experience to all Apple Stores » April 25, 2017 ⌘ Permalink This morning, Apple announced “Today at Apple,” a new push to roll out a new experience to all 495 Apple stores: Apple today announced plans to launch dozens of new educational sessions next month in all 495 Apple stores ranging in topics from photo and video to music, coding, art and design and more. The hands-on sessions, collectively called “Today at Apple,” will be led by highly-trained team members, and in select cities world-class artists, photographers and musicians, teaching sessions from basics and how-to lessons to professional-level programs. The new program offers more than 60 different sessions, including photo walks, hands-on projects for kids, coding sessions, lessons on pro apps and more. In an interview with CBS, Apple’s SVP of Retail Angela Ahrendts said: So we call the software of the store that we are launching the end of May – we call that Today at Apple. That “software” will roll out across Apple’s nearly 500 stores, many of which will be changed literally overnight. Ahrendts calls it all an effort to create “town squares” where customers engage with their devices and their communities. A lot of the big online guys have said they’re opening stores. Amazon’s investing in stores. Google’s investing in stores. … Starbucks figured it out, you know? Being a gathering place for – right? ‘Meet me at Starbucks,”’ Ahrendts said. “And you know, I’ve told the teams, “I’ll know we’ve done a really, really great job if the next generation, if Gen Z says, ‘Meet me at Apple. Did you see what’s going on at Apple today?'” Apple stores have had training and one-off events for years, but this is a more focused effort in turning Apple stores into community hubs. To facilitate them, stores that have not been updated to the new design will receive upgraded AV equipment as needed. While I’m the first person to complain that Apple stores are already often too busy and sometimes under-staffed, I can see what the company is trying to do here, and I applaud it. The Apple store should be a hub for those in the Mac and iOS community, and serve to educate and inspire Apple’s customers.

Qualcomm's modems support Gigabit LTE, but Intel's won't until next year, CNET says. Gigabit LTE is starting its rollout in some cities this year. Todd Haselton | @robotodd 11 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES Toru Hanai | Reuters Apple Inc CEO Tim Cook The next iPhone may not be able to hold a candle to the Galaxy S8 when it comes to how fast you'll be able to download music and movies or surf the web. CNET published an enlightening report on Tuesday that explains why this might be the case, especially if history repeats itself. Earlier this month, for example, Qualcomm countersued Apple alleging in part that Apple doesn't use Qualcomm's modems to their full potential. Apple buys modems from both Intel and Qualcomm and needs both to perform similarly for the end user, even if one chip can technically outperform another. That's why the company may hold back some modems from their full potential, at least according to Qualcomm. Here's why that will matter moving forward. Qualcomm's latest chip, the Snapdragon 835, features the Snapdragon X16 LTE modem, which is capable of providing Gigabit LTE download and upload speeds. Without getting too technical, Gigabit LTE has the potential to be much, much faster than 4G LTE — the current wireless standard in the U.S. A very fast wireless speed right now would come in around 100Mbps, so we're talking about 10x that. show chapters Apple's iPhone 8 will be delayed, according to a KGI analyst    Monday, 24 Apr 2017 | 10:45 AM ET | 00:56 U.S. carriers will begin rolling out support for Gigabit LTE this year as they move to rolling out 5G networks, and phones like the Galaxy S8 are "future-proof" with support for the new tech. Intel won't offer Gigabit LTE in its chips until next year, CNET said, which is where the problem lies. (Intel declined to comment.) Apple uses its own processors in the iPhone but will almost certainly purchase modems from both Qualcomm and Intel, as it typically does. If this is the case, Apple may have some modems from Qualcomm that are capable of supporting Gigabit LTE — and others from Intel that are not. Several scenarios could play out if that happens. Apple could launch a new iPhone with modems from Intel and Qualcomm that don't support Gigabit LTE at all. Or it could launch smartphones with modems from Intel that don't support Gigabit LTE and modems from Qualcomm that do, but sandbag the Qualcomm modems to keep everything even. It might also decide to keep the Qualcomm chips for launch in the U.S., as CNET suggests, and deploy Intel chips in international markets where Gigabit LTE isn't ready to launch yet. Finally, and here's just a shot-in-the-dark scenario, Apple could reserve the Gigabit LTE modems from Qualcomm for the rumored iPhone 8 and leave 4G LTE modems in the rumored iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus. Customers who want to pay for the added speeds could simply buy the more premium smartphone. Gigabit LTE is expected to start hitting only some cities this year, so it might not seem necessary for consumers to buy smartphones with Gigabit LTE support just yet. If you're planning to keep it for a few years, however, Gigabit LTE is definitely something you'll want to make sure your new smartphone supports.

Norris previously worked at the Mission Operations Innovation Office of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab, where he worked on new ways of using AR and VR technology to simulate controlling spacecrafts and robots in space. Although only recently disclosed, Apple hired Norris earlier this year as the senior manager of its augmented reality team, under former Dolby Labs executive, Mike Rockwell. Apple’s AR team is working on a pair of AR glasses for future Apple devices, according to reports. Apple’s choice of hiring Norris is quite telling. Norris worked on several projects with NASA, including giving headsets to scientist so they can experience what it’s like to be on Mars. Norris also provided NASA with Microsoft’s HoloLens to allow astronauts at the International Space Station to experience mixed reality (MR). Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive officer, is looking towards the future with AR, believing people will “have AR experiences every day, almost like eating three meals a day. It will become that much a part of you,” as reported by Bloomberg. Apple looks to have AR hardware in the hand of consumers by 2018. Many other teams such as Sony, Microsoft, Facebook and maybe even Spotify are working towards wearable technology in the form of VR, AR and MR.

Why are vinyl records still a thing 4 Reasons Why Vinyl Is Better Than Digital 4 Reasons Why Vinyl Is Better Than Digital Greetings, peasants! What, still listening to MP3s? Look, as someone who knows more about music than you, I think it's my duty to tell you there's a better way. It's called vinyl. Read More ? The answer to both of these questions is audio quality. Even though we now stream most of our music, we instinctively know it doesn’t sound as good as what we heard on our old CDs. Thankfully there are ways to make your streaming music app of choice sound better. From Apple Music to Tidal, all the major music streaming services are capable of playing better audio quality. The secret is hidden in the settings, with most apps set to “basic” quality by default to ensure that streaming is smooth. What Makes Audio Quality Better? When any app streams music, it usually encodes it as an MP3 How Audio Compression Works, and Can You Really Tell the Difference? How Audio Compression Works, and Can You Really Tell the Difference? In this article, we'll take a look at how music compression works, and whether it has any real effect on how your music actually sounds. Read More . MP3 being a compressed digital audio format. The compression process means you lose some audio quality. To retain quality, you need to use a lossless digital audio format, like FLAC or Apple Lossless Audio Codec (ALAC). For a rough estimate, an MP3 file usually transmits 128–192 Kbps. On the other hand, a FLAC file usually transmits 1411 kilobits of data per second. The difference is massive, and hence, a FLAC file is much larger than an MP3 file. You can compare different audio formats here 10 Common Audio Formats Compared: Which One Should You Use? 10 Common Audio Formats Compared: Which One Should You Use? We may all be familiar with MP3, what about AAC, FLAC, OGG, or WMA? Why do so many standards exist? Which ones should you care about and which ones can you ignore? Read More . Every streaming service’s success lies on how quickly and smoothly it can play the song you want to listen to. Streaming apps therefore prefer compressed audio formats like MP3. If you change the format to a lossless format, your audio quality will improve. The good news is all of these streaming music apps apps give you the option to switch up the quality. Spotify If you don’t change the audio quality, you’re missing a trick to getting the most out of Spotify Streaming Music Secrets: How To Get More Out Of Spotify Streaming Music Secrets: How To Get More Out Of Spotify As brilliant as the standard Spotify experience is, it can be improved via the use of websites and apps, transforming an already excellent service into an unmissable one. Read More . The process is different on the desktop app, the iOS app, and the Android app. Either way you’ll need a Spotify Premium account for this. On Desktop — Go to Menu > Settings > High Quality Streaming On iOS — Go to Your Library > Settings > Stream Quality > High (or Extreme) On Android — Go to Your Library > Settings > Music Quality and choose the quality for Streaming or for Download. In the iOS and Android app, you can also choose the quality of downloaded music from Spotify. It’s labelled as “Sync Quality”, which again has Normal, High, or Extreme quality as options. Spotify classifies Normal Quality as 96 Kbps, High Quality as 160 Kbps, and Extreme as 320 Kbps. It’s not lossless audio, but even with compression, 320 Kbps is excellent. Apple Music Even though Apple has a lossless codec (ALAC), it doesn’t use it for Apple Music. All Apple Music songs use AAC 10 Essential Apple Music Tips You Really Need to Know 10 Essential Apple Music Tips You Really Need to Know Since its launch in 2015, Apple Music has come a long way, baby. Unfortunately, it's still not the easiest or most intuitive service to get to grips with. Which is where we come in... Read More , a similar process to MP3 that delivers compressed lossy files. By default, Apple Music uses its high quality AAC files, which play at 256 Kbps. When you are using cellular data, it switches to the lower quality files. You can choose to also listen to high quality audio while on cellular data. On iOS — Go to the Settings app on your iPhone, and tap Music > Mobile Data to choose. On Android — In the Apple Music app, go to Menu > Settings > Playback > High Quality on Cellular and toggle it on. Apple Music does not allow users to change the quality of downloaded music. By default, it downloads music files at High Quality. You can’t change the quality setting when listening to Apple Music through iTunes on Windows or Mac. You’re stuck on High Quality, since Apple assumes you are using Wi-Fi or some sort of broadband connectivity. In your face, 4G hotspot users! Google Play Music Google has three quality settings: low, normal, and high. But it refuses to divulge what this means in bitrate. The educated guess across different forums puts it to mean low at 128 Kbps, normal at 192 Kbps, and high at 320 kbps. Plus, you can set it differently for cellular and Wi-Fi data. On Android — Go to Menu > Settings > Playback > Quality on mobile network to change the setting. Below it, you’ll find Quality on wifi network to change that. In Menu > Settings > Playback > Downloading, you can adjust the quality of downloaded files as well.

Here are seven of the most compelling features you'll find within Google's streaming music service. Read More doesn’t let you change the setting. We assume it’s set to “Always High”, since that’s the default Wi-Fi setting on the mobile app. Tidal Tidal rose to prominence as a streaming music app that finally offers true lossless audio Tidal Ups the Ante to Appeal to Audiophiles Tidal Ups the Ante to Appeal to Audiophiles Not content with merely offering high-fidelity audio, Tidal is now adding what it calls "master-quality recordings". But will this be enough to tempt people to subscribe to Tidal? Read More . It’s the only app to stream FLAC files at 1411 Kbps. If you’re an audiophile with the best headphones on your ears, this is the streaming service you need. On desktop — In the left-hand menu, go to Settings > Streaming > Quality to adjust. On Android and iOS — In the Tidal app, go to Menu > Settings > Quality to find different options. Here, you can separately adjust WiFi Streaming Quality, Cellular Streaming Quality, Audio Download Quality, and Video Download Quality. HiFi/Master is FLAC, while Normal and High are compressed music files. You cannot adjust the quality of downloaded files from the desktop app. Deezer Deezer is the oft-overlooked music streaming app, but it has plenty going for it Everything You Need to Know About Deezer Music Everything You Need to Know About Deezer Music Deezer has finally launched in the U.S., and unlike other music streaming services with potential, Deezer is actually good enough to compete with the big boys. Here's everything you need to know... Read More . Like the bigwigs, it also offers granular control over audio quality. And you can stream in lossless FLAC if you have a Sonos. On Windows or Mac — In the Deezer app, go to Settings > Audio Settings > Audio Quality On Android and iOS — In the Deezer app, go to My Music > Audio Settings > Audio Quality > Custom You can adjust music quality for streaming with cellular data, streaming over Wi-Fi, downloading with cellular, and downloading over Wi-Fi. Deezer also offers a “Deezer Elite” standard, which uses lossless FLAC files. However, this is only available to owners of Sonos wireless systems (read our review of Sonos Sonos PLAY:1 Review and Giveaway Sonos PLAY:1 Review and Giveaway Read More ). Recommended Audio Settings Yes, high-quality audio is excellent, but cellular data technology hasn’t caught up to it yet. If you’re sitting in one spot with excellent 4G network connectivity, you can stream a FLAC file from Tidal without issues. But if you are moving around, prepare for a stuttering stream and waiting for audio files to buffer. It’s not only FLAC, even the high quality settings on Apple Music and Google Play Music struggle with this. So for all of the services we recommend: Quality over cellular data — Not over 192 Kbps. Quality over Wi-Fi (for broadband connections under 2 Mbps): Not over 320 Kbps. Quality over Wi-Fi (for broadband connections of 2 Mbps or more): FLAC lossless audio. Does Audio Quality Matter to You? Tidal and Deezer offer music quality that Spotify, Apple Music, and Google Play Music don’t offer. But does that really matter? Do you care about the option to listen to FLAC lossless audio when you choose a music streaming app? Or are Spotify and Apple Music simply good enough for you?

Apps iOS Apps Mac Apps Accessories Tips Jailbreaking Jailbreak Tweaks How to Jailbreak Unlock Devices iPhone iPad Mac Apple Watch Apple TV Deals Latest Deals Apple hires former NASA veterans for augmented reality and self-driving software testing Christian Zibreg on April 25, 2017 0 Apple has hired several expets from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), including three engineers who worked at the space organization’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. They, along with other engineers, have been tasked with working on Apple’s rumored augmented reality projects and self-driving software initiatives. According to the latest articles from Bloomberg, Dow Jones Newswire and Business Insider, a rare bureaucratic mistake has revealed Apple’s secret team of NASA veterans and experts holding PhDs in robotics and other related fields. They were apparently recruited for Project Titan, Apple’s self-driving car project, and augmented reality, another not-so-secret Apple initiative. On April 14, Apple received a permit from the California Department of Motor Vehicles to test its self-driving software using three 2015 Lexus RX450h vehicles operated by a total of six drivers. The Wall Street Journal notes that Apple’s program is probably in its early stages because the company is enlisting senior-level engineers. At other technology companies, senior employees are typically involved in day-to-day testing until autonomous driving software is considered stable enough that others can take over. An industry insider told Business Insider that these PhDs report to professor Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Apple’s first-ever Director of Artificial Intelligence, who joined the company in October 2016. The publication learned that he’s now hiring a team of about 20 researchers “with a mandate to work almost entirely on self-driving car technology.” That filing, obtained through a public-records request, accidentally identified multiple drivers who will be in the front seat of three Lexus sport-utility vehicles outfitted with Apple’s rumored technology to make them autonomous. Shilpa Gulati, one of the drivers listed on Apple’s permit, was part of a NASA-funded project to develop an autonomous vehicle to explore one of Jupiter’s moons. Before joining NASA, he developed algorithms for a car that could drive on highways for German auto parts supplier Robert Bosch GmbH. Bosch’s marketing video, embedded below, features Gulati riding in a BMW vehicle retrofitted with sensors and computers to make it drive more or less autonomously. The permit names former Tesla engineer and Stanford PhD Christopher David Gadda and control systems PhD David Rosas. The following Apple drivers previously worked at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory: Paul Hebert—Designed a robot that could unlock a door Jeremy Ma—Created algorithms for detecting three-dimensional objects Victor Hwang—Worked on motion-planning algorithms for robots Bloomberg has learned from its own sources that Apple also hired Jeff Norris. Norris founded the Mission Operations Innovation Office of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab. According to his website, he led NASA’s advanced efforts to create new ways to control spacecraft and robots in space with virtual and augmented reality. He is now a senior manager on Apple’s augmented reality team run by former Dolby Labs executive Mike Rockwell. That team is believed to be working on a pair of augmented reality glasses and related features for future iPhones. From the Bloomberg article: Norris’s NASA projects included issuing headsets to scientists on the ground so they could experience live views on Mars and providing Microsoft oloLens headsets to astronauts living in the International Space Station. Norris joined NASA in 1999 and helped create software for controlling Mars exploration rovers from the ground. Here’s a video of Norris’s Project Sidekick on the Space Station. Apple CEO Tim Cook previously said that people will have augmented reality experiences every day, “almost like eating three meals a day,” adding that augmented reality “will become that much a part of you.” Bloomberg previously reported that Apple was looking to bring augmented reality hardware to market as soon as 2018. These engineers’ collective experience in robotics, augmented reality and camera vision from their NASA work would be valuable to Apple’s self-driving software initiative. It has been reported that Apple has about a thousand employees working on Project Titan. According to Dow Jones Newswire, Apple’s permit includes a ten-page training plan for test drivers detailing specific moments when they might need to take control of a vehicle on the road. “Each driver is given two practice runs and three trials to pass tests such as responding to a vehicle’s rapid acceleration by tapping the brakes,” said Dow Jones. Self-driving experts don’t come cheap. Sebastian Thrun, who established Google’s self-driving car project, said last year that experienced autonomous-vehicle researchers were valued at $10 million each, based on GM’s acquisition of Cruise Automation, which had about 40 employees, and Uber’s acquisition of Ottomotto, which had about 70 employees. Deloitte estimated that the auto industry pulls in about $2 trillion in annual revenue.

Josh Smith04/25/2017 This is what the new iPhone 8 may look like. A new set of photos shows a dummy unit, or mock-up, of the iPhone 8 with a new all glass front design, metal edges, new camera placement and no visible home button. The treasure trove of photos came just as multiple reports suggest Apple will need to delay from the traditional iPhone 8 release date to deliver the new iPhone to consumers. This is in addition to a potentially higher iPhone 8 price. After years of similar designs, growing pains may keep this from arriving just in time for the moment that users can upgrade with the Annual iPhone Upgrade plan that Apple offers. Is this the iPhone 8? If this is the iPhone 8, will you wait to buy it? Above you see multiple angles of what could be an all new iPhone 8. The leak from @VenyaGeskin1 appears on 9to5Mac and it includes what looks like a CNC sample for a new iPhone. While we cannot verify that this is the actual iPhone 8, we’ve seen the same kind of photos reveal the actual look of the iPhone months ahead of Apple’s reveal. In 2012 we shared an iPhone 5 engineering sample made of similar materials that a case manufacturer used to test the fit of early iPhone case prototypes. There is a good chance that this is something along those lines and not an actual iPhone 8 mock-up from Apple. That doesn’t mean you can dismiss it. Our iPhone 5 engineering sample showed off the new iPhone 5 design months ahead of Apple and even with tighter security leaks like this are possible. While the photos don’t include any way to show this, the iPhone 8 will include a front virtual home button integrated into the screen that includes Touch ID, according to their source. Will You Wait for a Later iPhone 8 Release Date? We expected to see the iPhone 8 release date arrive in September, which is when the iPhone typically lands on store shelves. It’s something of a routine at this point and even though nothing is confirmed, consumers expect to see a new iPhone in September. Ming-Chi Kou, who shares many accurate iPhone and Apple leaks, says that mass production of the iPhone 8 is pushed to October and November. Kou cites supply issues with the parts needed for massive upgrades to the iPhone for the delay. Even though the iPhone 8 release date may end up later, Kou says the iPhone 7s release date should arrive on schedule. Nikkei also weighs in stating that the iPhone 8 release date may come one to two months later than traditional iPhone releases due to components. “There might be a one to two month delay in Samsung’s production of OLED panels for Apple,” Brian Huh, an analyst at research company IHS Markit told Nikkei, adding “Samsung originally plans to begin churning out OLED panels in May but now the schedule will likely be pushed back to the end of June or sometime in July” Given the rumored amount of change from the iPhone 7 to the iPhone 8, will you wait for the iPhone 8 or buy an iPhone 7s as soon as it is available? Take Our Poll 8 iPhone 8 Features We Want in 2017 New iPhone 8 Design to Enable Features   1 / 8 Everyone wants a new iPhone 8 design, but most people don't know what changes they actually want. We're leading off our iPhone 8 feature wishlist with a new iPhone 8 design because it is a key part of enabling new iPhone 8 features. After sticking with a very similar design for three years there is an expectation of major changes for the 2017 iPhone and here are the things we would love to see Apple do with a new design. Shrink the overall size of the iPhone 8 Plus without lowering the screen size. Apple could do this by shrinking the bezels on the sides and bottom of the iPhone some to offer a smaller overall package. Apple could choose to change where you use Touch ID and how the home button works in new ways to make this happen. We definitely don't want a phone that is slim just to be slim, especially not at the price of battery life, but there is something to be said about an iPhone 8 design that trims some fat. The Jet Black iPhone 7 feels different than all the other colors. While it is more susceptible to scratches it is easier to grip, which is something we can definitely see Apple add to the new iPhone 8. KGI Securities Analyst Ming-Chi Kou predicts the iPhone 8 design will look include an all glass front and back with stainless steel metal on the edges of premium models. This could come together for an iPhone 8 design that looks like a cross between the iPhone 4s and the Jet Black iPhone 7.   1 / 8 One Response 04/25/2017 MiniMage Reply You’re missing a voting option. I’m happy with the iPhone 6 I’ve had for 23 months, and, while I would be eligible for an upgrade in a month, I’m planning to stick with what I’ve got and upgrade my phone PLAN to unlimited data, instead (and still have a lower bill, because those monthly device fees were over $25).

Anytime. Anywhere. Build Apps 5x Faster For Half the Cost Enterprise Cloud Computing On Force.com Study Finds Samsung's S8 Phones More Prone to Screen Cracks PUBLISHED: APRIL 25 2017 Samsung's latest phones feature big wraparound screens and lots of glass. They also appear to break more easily, according to tests run by SquareTrade, a company that sells gadget-repair plans. The nearly all-glass design of Samsung's Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus makes them beautiful, SquareTrade said, but also "extremely susceptible to cracking when dropped from any angle." Samsung didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The new phones have received positive reviews from The Associated Press and other outlets. Samsung says advanced orders for the S8 were 30 percent higher than that for the Galaxy S7 phones. The company didn't release specific figures. The S8 starts at $750, which is about $100 higher than the S7. SquareTrade said Monday that cracks appeared on screens of both the S8 and S8 Plus after just one face-down drop onto a sidewalk from six feet. The phones had similar problems when dropped on the backs and sides. Unsurprisingly, both models did well in water-drop tests. The phones had some audio distortion, but that is typical and temporary. The S8 has water-resistance features. SquareTrade didn't test the phones' battery, the source of problems that led to a recall of Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 phone. © 2017 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

Next Article > Optometrists Aim To Limit Online Eye Exams By Susan Haigh PUBLISHED: APRIL 24 2017 Some optometrists are pushing back against new technology that allows consumers to get prescriptions for contact lenses and glasses with the click of a keyboard and a smartphone. While proponents of these limited online eye exams argue they provide both financial savings and convenience, medical professionals contend patients could be put at risk. Without a full, face-to-face exam from a doctor, they argue potential medical problems could be overlooked. "Our concern is making sure that people get the health of their eyes checked," said Connecticut state Rep. Kevin Ryan, who has a doctor of optometry degree. He has proposed legislation this session that would require in-person eye examinations conducted by an optometrist or a physician who specializes in ophthalmology for contact lens prescriptions. More than a dozen states have decided to regulate online exams in recent years, according to the American Optometric Association. In Virginia, for example, online eye exam providers must meet certain consumer protection standards, while South Carolina last year barred consumers from getting a prescription for glasses or contact lenses from an online exam. Ryan said an optometrist will make sure a patient's contact lenses, which he referred to as "a medical device on the eye," are a good fit. Ryan said lenses can cause damage to the eye if they're not properly fitted. Also, he said professional fittings typically include checking the pressure in the eye and basic eye health to make sure no adverse conditions have developed. In contrast, Ryan said the online tests are "unproven and untested" and there have been examples of patients receiving the wrong prescription. "I'm going to say for like 95 percent of the people ... they can get away with this," he said, referring to the online exams, which typically include a refraction test that measures a person's prescription for glasses or contacts. "But everybody is kind of taking a risk. Another health condition can develop in your eye that you just won't be aware of." Chicago-based Opternative is one of several companies offering a variation of an online eye test. According to the company's website, their test takes 15 minutes or less to complete. The patient tells Opternative what he or she sees on a computer screen, standing 10 feet away, by using a smart phone as a remote control. The website states how a previous prescription is required "most of the time." An ophthalmologist in the patient's state will review the test results and their prior prescription. The procedure costs $40 for a prescription for eye glasses or contracts and $60 for both, while a typical exam by an optometrist can cost $127 on average, according to the company. Opternative states how the procedure is not a replacement for a comprehensive eye health examination. Opternative, which filed a lawsuit last year challenging the South Carolina law banning online exams, is fighting the proposed Connecticut legislation. "New clinically proven technologies like Opternative would be blocked from providing patients access to safe, convenient and low-cost prescriptions for glasses and contacts," said Dr. Steven Lee, OC, chief scientific officer and co-founder of Opternative, in written testimony. He said state lawmakers should pass legislation that enhances patient access to telehealth, not diminish it. But Dr. Brian Lynch, a practicing optometrist in Branford, Connecticut, and the legislative chairman for the Connecticut Association of Optometrists, argues such online tests don't meet the benchmark already created in the state's telemedicine laws. "It will leave patients with serious ocular and systemic issues undiagnosed and delay the care patients should be receiving," he said. "But without a medical history, how could they know?" © 2017 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media. All rights reserved.

The iOS 10.3 update’s reign lasted just a week. A week after its release, Apple released a brand new version of iOS 10 dubbed iOS 10.3.1. With iOS 10.3.1 now out for the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch, we can assume the iOS 10.3.2 update that’s currently in beta testing will be next in line. Apple hasn’t confirmed an iOS 10.3.2 release date for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch but with each passing day, the release gets closer. The company is currently on fourth iOS 10.3.2 beta for developers and the general public. We could see one or two more betas emerge before everything is said and done but we should only be a few weeks away from a release. With the iOS 10.3.2 release date getting close, we want to share some tips that could help make the transition from iOS 10.3.1 to iOS 10.3.2 a little easier for you. iOS 10.3.2 Release Time The iOS 10.3.2 update is shaping up to be a small release with under-the-hood improvements and security patches. That could change as the beta progresses but we’re expecting it to be a maintenance release. It’s not as exciting as iOS 10.3 but iOS 10.3.2 could be an important update for your device, particularly if you’re struggling with iOS problems. And while you might be tempted to check your phone every 15 minutes for the iOS 10.3.2 update, that’s not how Apple iOS releases work. It’s difficult to predict the exact iOS 10.3.2 release date but it’s very easy to predict the iOS 10.3.2 release time. Here are a few things to keep in mind as we close in on the iOS 10.3.2 release date. Apple never releases iOS updates on the weekend so there’s no need to check for iOS 10.3.2 on Saturday or Sunday. iOS updates almost always arrive between 9AM and 10AM Pacific. General rule of thumb is to check around 10AM Pacific. This goes for the iOS 10.3.2 beta releases as well. Betas typically come every 1-2 weeks, usually on Monday. While some of you will want to download the iOS 10.3.2 update the second it arrives, many others will want to wait. Don’t Try the iOS 10.3.2 Beta Unless You Really, Really Want To Given what’s on board (bugs and little else), the only people that should be trying the beta are those people who really, really want to help Apple squash problems, developers, and those who really, really want to test performance. Most of you should avoid the early version of iOS 10.3.2, especially if you’re having an outstanding experience on your version of iOS. Be it iOS 10.3.1 or something older. Again, Apple could add some more meat to the iOS 10.3.2 update in the future but as of right now it’s pretty bare bones. Now that we’re on beta 4, we don’t expect much. For more on the merits of the iOS 10.3.2 beta, take a look at our guide. Prepare Your iPhone, iPad or iPod It’s never too early to start preparing for an iOS update’s release. Here are a few pre-installation tips to keep in your back pocket as we approach the iOS 10.3.2 update’s release: Use this time to cleanup your device. Get rid of files (apps, music, etc), anything you no longer use. Cleaning up your device could improve your device’s performance. Start backing up your data. If you don’t know where to start, you’ll want to research iCloud backups, iTunes backups, and the differences between the two. If you want to download iOS 10.3.2 right when it comes out, make sure your device has at least a 50% charge (or you’re near a charger) around 10AM Pacific. Get your login information handy. Make sure you have the device’s passcode, Apple ID, and your important logins ready on release day. The update might log you out of various apps and services. Dig into feedback from iOS 10.3.2 beta testers. You might learn about a potential problem or benefit to your version of iOS 10.3.2. A little prep work will help you avoid major problems during the iOS 10.3.2 installation process. It’ll also help you avoid headaches once you get the new update on board your phone or tablet. Dig Into iOS 10.3 and iOS 10.3.1 If You Need To If you failed to download iOS 10.3 and you plan on skipping the iOS 10.3.1 update, make sure you know what you’re getting into before you download the iOS 10.3.2 update on your phone. If you skipped iOS 10.3 and don’t have plans to download iOS 10.3.1, you’ll get the changes from those updates baked into your iOS 10.3.2 update. (Note: You’ll also get the features and fixes from any other iOS update you missed.) If you plan on downloading iOS 10.3.2, you’ll want to get familiar with these changes ahead of the iOS 10.3.2 release. A new iCloud storage breakdown in iOS 10.3 shows you exactly how your using your space. We’ve put together a broad guide to the iOS 10.3.1 update. We’ve also put together a more in depth walkthrough that will take you step-by-step through the changes included in these updates. You’ll also want to get familiar with the new Clips application that arrived earlier this month. Again, you’ll need to download iOS 10.3.1/iOS 10.3.2 in order to use the Clips app on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch. Clips doesn’t support popular devices like the iPhone 5 or iPad 4. Report iOS 10.3.2 Problems If you choose to install iOS 10.3.2 on release day there’s a chance you’ll run into an issue during or after the installation process finishes up. If you do run into an iOS 10.3.2 problem on your phone, there’s no need to panic. Sometimes, it can take a couple of days for an update to settle in. If you notice weird battery life on release day, give it a day or two to even out. If problems persist after two days with iOS 10.3.2, or if the issues are serious, you’ll want to take action. There are tons of resources out there but our list of fixes for common iOS 10 problems is a great place to start. If you don’t consider yourself an expert, you’ll want to bookmark those fixes so you’re ready to tackle problems as soon as they popup. If you can’t fix your problem and/or you want to help the community, you’ll want to report iOS 10.3.2 problems as you see them. There are a few places to do that. You can relay your problem to Apple Support on Twitter and/or get in contact with Apple Support via the company’s website. We also recommend reporting your problem on Apple’s Discussion forums to alert Apple and other users to your issue. You Can Test iOS 10.3.2 Remember, if you don’t want to deal with the iOS 10.3.2 beta, you can still take the official version of iOS 10.3.2 for a test drive provided you’re on iOS 10.3.1 when it arrives. For a short time, Apple will allow you to downgrade from iOS 10.3.2 to iOS 10.3.1. Apple is no longer signing off on iOS 10.2.1 or iOS 10.3 so you won’t be able to drop back to either of those iOS 10 updates. Most of you will probably choose to remain on iOS 10.3.2 but others might benefit from dropping down to the older version of iOS 10. It could help improve your device’s performance in key areas like battery life, connectivity, and speed. If you aren’t familiar with the iOS downgrade process, now is the time to get familiar with it. How to Get Off iOS 10.3.2 Beta If you chose to try the iOS 10.3.2 beta and you don’t want to get thrown onto the next iOS 10 beta , you’ll want to unenroll from the iOS 10.3.2 beta once the final version is released. Here’s how to do that. Go to Settings > General > Profiles and then tap the iOS Beta Software Profile that appears on your device. Enter your passcode, if there is on associated with the device, and tap Delete Profile. You will no longer receive beta software. Go into your Settings or iTunes and download iOS 10.3.2. If you’ve been running an iOS 10.3.2 beta and the watchOS beta on your Apple Watch, you’ll need to take a few more steps before, on, or after the iOS 10.3.2 release date. Here’s how to get the watchOS beta off your device, Open the Apple Watch app on your iPhone. Tap the My Watch tab. Go to General > Profiles. Tap the beta profile you want to remove. Enter a passcode if needed and then tap Delete Profile. If you want to use iOS beta software again you’ll need to install the correct beta profile. 4 Reasons Not to Install iOS 10.3.1 & 9 Reasons You Should Install iOS 10.3.1 If You Want Better Security   1 / 13 If you value your security, you'll want to seriously consider downloading the iOS 10.3.1 update on your iPhone or iPad.  iOS 10.3.1 brings a single security patch for a potential Wi-Fi exploit. But if you failed to install iOS 10.3, your iOS 10.3.1 update will bring its monster list of patches as well.  The iOS 10.3 update delivered over 60 known patches for potential exploits. That's substantial, even for a milestone upgrade. The previous version of iOS 10, iOS 10.2.1, brought 14 known patches. Among them is a patch for a Safari ransomware bug that scammers used to extort iOS users who viewed pornography on their device.  These patches enhance the security on your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch making them ideal for those of you who store sensitive files/data on your device. Most people do. If you skipped the iOS 10.2.1 update and/or the iOS 10.2 update, know that iOS 10.3.1 brings their security patches with it as well. Again, the iOS 10.2.1 update had 14 important patches on board. You can see them all right here.  If you failed to install Apple's iOS 9.3.5 update, iOS 10.3.1 will also bring the three crucial security patches it delivered last year. These patch up serious security problems that could potentially expose your calls, contacts, texts, and emails. If security is important to you, iOS 10.3.1 is probably worth a download right now.   1 / 13 2 Responses 03/25/2017 James Burton Reply Hi I’m impressed with the amber alert system in the future is there going to be FBI warrants support 04/18/2017 Chile Reply DellLundg Slovakien NicholRan SherrillH Elfenbenskusten CaroleSch JacquieDe Schweiz ValorieHi BonnyMgrx Osterrike WindyChid OrvalGoul Nederlanderna MarthaSpa GabrieleC Everton SKKRalfgc GlendaXvr Spanien DakotaCam BrainBole Rumanien GeorginaE NoellaEll Valencia EstelleNe TerranceR Wales StaceyThe Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

Video What happens to companies that depend on the iPhone? Move over, Starbucks. Apple wants to be the gathering spot for younger generations. This week, Apple announced a series of educational sessions in all 495 Apple store locations around the U.S., starting in May. Titled “Today at Apple,” the hands-on sessions will bring together artists, photographers, and musicians at the top of their game to give customers tips on how to best use their Apple gear and software. “‘Today at Apple’ is one of the ways we’re evolving our experience to better serve local customers and entrepreneurs,” Apple’s senior vp of retail Angela Ahrendts said. “We’re creating a modern-day town square, where everyone is welcome in a space where the best of Apple comes together to connect with one another, discover a new passion, or take their skill to the next level. We’re creating a modern-day town square, where... the best of Apple comes together. The free sessions will cater to customers of all skill levels, ranging from coding lessons for kids to “Photo Walks” where iPhone photographers will get to venture out to learn about natural lighting and Portrait mode. “Today at Apple” also has sessions geared towards educators with Teacher Tuesday. Most sessions will be taught by Apple’s new Creative Pros, which Apple describes as “the liberal arts equivalent to Apple’s technical Geniuses.” To sign up for a free session, check out your local Apple store's website. Why this matters: ”Today at Apple” has Ahrendts’s fingerprints all over it. In an interview with CBS News, Ahrendts revealed her vision for the sessions is to make Apple stores more than a place where you buy stuff and get technical help. “Today at Apple” will also help Apple’s retail locations distinguish themselves from other online giants who are opening up brick-and-mortar stores. “A lot of the big online guys have said they’re opening stores. Amazon’s investing in stores. Google’s investing in stores...Starbucks figured it out, you know? ‘Meet me at Starbucks,”’ Ahrendts said. “I’ll know we’ve done a really, really great job if the next generation, if Gen Z says, ‘Meet me at Apple. Did you see what’s going on at Apple today?’” To comment on this article and other Macworld content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.

This is the second delay for the show’s launch, and Apple isn’t offering up any explanation for the delayed debut. No April premiere for Carpool Karaoke: The Series Carpool Karaoke: The Series is a stand-alone version of the Carpool Karaoke segment from The Late Show with James Corden. On The Late Show, Corden sings in cars with different celebrities. The series version sports a different host for each episode. The series had been scheduled to launch in March, according to Reuters, but was pushed out to April only days before a scheduled premiere party. Now the show is delayed again, and Apple isn’t offering a firm launch date. Just like before, Apple dropped its launch party plans just a few days before the premiere. All an Apple spokesperson would say is, “Carpool Karaoke: The Series will premiere on Apple Music later this year.” Two last minute delays for the premiere doesn’t bode well for the show in its current form. It likely didn’t get a good response from test audiences, so Apple went back to the editing room to make changes. A second delay could be a sign the reedited version didn’t go over well, either, so now they’re trying again. This time, Apple isn’t committing to a premiere date until it knows the show is really ready to go. It’s also possible, but unlikely, Apple is having issues securing licensing for the songs the celebrities sing along with on the show. The songs in each episode are planned out in advance, but edited to look spontaneous. The show’s producers would’ve worked to get the necessary licensing in place even before filming started, and likely recorded backup songs in case something fell through. Apple needs Carpool Karaoke: The Series, and its other original shows like Planet of the Apps to be strong hitters when they debut. Compelling original content is a key part of the plan to make Apple Music more enticing to TV viewers, and one of the elements in drawing new subscribers into the streaming content service. Reediting to get everything right is a smart move, assuming that’s what Apple is doing, and critical to making Apple Music stand out from competing streaming music services. The good news is that Apple wants to get its shows right; the bad news is that without some work it looks like Apple thinks Carpool Karaoke will tank.

Another report says iPhone 8 isn’t coming until October or November According to a report from Nikkei, insider sources say Samsung is having issues delivering the OLED panels Apple needs for the iPhone 8. They aren’t, however, offering any details for why there’s a problem. The latest leaks claim the iPhone 8 will use an curved-edge OLED screen with a virtual Home button and Touch ID sensors embedded in the glass. Considering Samsung has plenty of experience making OLED panels, the problem is likely related to Apple’s Touch ID sensors. Those sources also said suppliers are having problems with wireless charging components and new printed circuit board designs. Apparently Apple wants substantially smaller circuit boards to make room for a bigger battery, and component makers are facing overheating issues. Yesterday KGI’s Ming-Chi Kuo issued a report saying the iPhone 8 won’t ship until October or November because of OLED display issues, and problems with the 10 nanometer design process for the A11 processor. His report follows a similar one from earlier in the month that points to OLED display problems and a late-year release. Based on industry leaks, the iPhone 8 will fit a 5.8-inch OLED display into a form factor that’s the same size as the iPhone 7. It’ll have a near bezel-free design, wireless charging support, vertical stacked rear-facing cameras, and 3D sensing front-facing cameras. The iPhone 8 will be introduced along side the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus at a September media event where the latter two will ship within a few days. The iPhone 8 model, however, won’t hit store shelves until several weeks later and will likely be available in very limited quantities at first. Even though Apple isn’t talking about the next iPhone refresh yet, the picture we’re getting seems to be pretty clear: We’ll get three new models this fall, and one will be a premium device that’s nearly impossible to get. At this point it looks like anyone trying to get their hands on an iPhone 8 will have to work on their patience skills in a serious way.

Apple wants it stores to be the cool place to hang out Apple senior vice president of Retail Angela Ahrendts said, At the heart of every Apple Store is the desire to educate and inspire the communities we serve. ‘Today at Apple’ is one of the ways we’re evolving our experience to better serve local customers and entrepreneurs. More than 60 sessions are planned right now covering topics like photo and sketch walks, making movies, programming robots, creating music, and more. Apple says there will be sessions for beginners and experts so there’s something for everyone. The sessions start in May, and Ahrendts expects they’ll help draw in the local community. “We’re creating a modern-day town square, where everyone is welcome in a space where the best of Apple comes together to connect with one another, discover a new passion, or take their skill to the next level,” she said. Going for a town square feel is essentially what local coffee shops are already doing, and that’s something Apple wants to be in on. Not just a store, but a social gathering place. Adding compelling activities and seminars can help draw people in, and time will tell if that helps turn Apple’s stores into the place you go hang out. That’ll take more than cool presentations, and looking at your favorite coffee shop drives that point home. They’re places people feel comfortable chatting, working on their computers, and killing time. Apple needs to overcome the ingrained notion that going to stores is just a shopping experience. Today at Apple can certainly help with that, but maybe Ahrendts also needs to copy a Barnes & Noble strategy and add in-store coffee shops, too. Teach people, let them buy a drink, and give them a cool place to hangout and maybe do a little work. That’s how Apple can turn its stores into the modern-day town square.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Software Pangu Demoes iOS 10.3 / iOS 10.3.1 Jailbreak on Video – Could Release Next Week By Uzair Ghani 13 hours ago 37Shares Share Tweet Submit Pangu, the infamous jailbreak team out of China, has recently demoed an iOS 10.3 / iOS 10.3.1 jailbreak on stage. iOS 10.3 / iOS 10.3.1 Jailbreak Could Arrive Next Week, or Not at All The initial Yalu jailbreak hype died down when Apple patched the necessary vulnerabilities with iOS 10.2.1 and above. At this point, there’s no publicly available jailbreak for Apple’s latest mobile software release, iOS 10.3 and iOS 10.3.1. However, if the latest piece of news is anything to go by, then it seems as though things are about to take a drastic turn for the better. Related New iOS Jailbreak Tweak Displays Exact Time When Notification Was Received Pangu, the team responsible for the wonderful Pangu9 jailbreak, walked on stage at a conference and casually demoed an iOS 10.3 / iOS 10.3.1 jailbreak on an iPhone 7. From the video below, you can clearly see that the device is going through the liberation process. I’m sure people have a lot of questions at this point regarding this jailbreak and which devices it will be compatible with. According to one source, the jailbreak will play nicely with 64-bit devices. That’s pretty much the entire range of phones and tablets that can run iOS 10 out of the box. Also, it appears as though Pangu is aiming to release the iOS 10.3.1 jailbreak to the public some time next week, given everything goes to plan. At least that’s what the source of this news is claiming.

We have no word officially from Pangu itself, and every speculation at this point is like firing an arrow blindfolded. If there is anything on the jailbreak end, it’s highly likely that Pangu will eventually tweet out something or make things official using some other channel. Till then, it’s best to stay on iOS 10.3 or iOS 10.3.1 and avoid updating to further iOS releases if there are any released by Apple in the time to come. While you are at it, make sure you return to this space again for more updates regarding the iOS 10.3.1 jailbreak. We will be covering the launch, including proper tutorials, if everything comes through nicely.

The store is two levels and offers beautiful views of the Dubai Fountain and Burj Khalifa, with doors that can stand permanently open to allow air to flow directly into the building. Apple has previously designed stores with open facades, but the one in Dubai, where heat is a major factor in the summer, was a challenge for Apple’s designers. “Very challenging, but I think the design team saw it as an incredible opportunity,” said Angela Ahrendts, Apple’s senior vice-president of retail. “We wanted their to be certain similarities to Union Square [where the store opens up over a central square in San Francisco]. We wanted the entire glass façade that is so ‘Apple’ and makes us so transparent because the whole goal is to be one with the community and always look outward and not just inward.” But Ahrendts said it also important to have touches that are locally relevant. “The trees are local. Of course, the team is local. But then what they [asked] was. ‘How do we do something that shades?’” She said that was how Apple came up with the ideas for the “solar wings” that will shade the front of the store. The ‘wings’ are mobile, 37-feet tall, made of carbon fibre and meant to invoke the image of falcons. They can be adjusted to for environmental conditions. Ahrendts said the wings are also the largest kinetic (moving) art installation in the world. When asked why Apple didn’t open at the Dubai Mall first as many expected, instead of opening stores first in Abu Dhabi’s Yas Mall and the Mall of the Emirates, Ahrendt said the company took its time to make sure their store at the Dubai Mall was “the best.” “This is the number one mall in the region, if not the world, with 80 million people visiting ... Sometimes waiting for something great just takes time.” More from Technology New Apple store: All you need to know Apple now gives you wings to go with your view Yahlive signs broadcasting deal with Tajikistan Man murders daughter live on Facebook Report released on The Entrepreneurial Emirates Google assistant can recognise different voices Impact of VAT on electronics won’t last Eros sees 10% growth in revenues to Dh4b tags from this storyDubai follow this tag on MGNAbu Dhabi follow this tag on MGNBurj Khalifa follow this tag on MGNApple follow this tag on MGNDUBAI follow this tag on MGN filed underGulfNewsBusinessSectorsTechnology tagsDubai follow this tag on MGN+ MGNAbu Dhabi follow this tag on MGN+ MGNBurj Khalifa follow this tag on MGN+ MGNApple follow this tag on MGN+ MGNDUBAI follow this tag on MGN+ MGN Also In TechnologyNew Apple store: All you need to know Business Gallery The 2017 Shanghai Auto Show 24th Arabian Travel Market begins in Dubai Business Videos PlayAbu Dhabi Ship Building enjoys growing success Strata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing FOLLOW US Most Popular ViewedCommentedVideosPictures 01New Apple store: All you need to know 02Impact of VAT on electronics won’t last 03Individuals can access VPNs in UAE Play Abu Dhabi Ship Building enjoys growing success Nov 24, 2016 Play Strata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing Oct 25, 2016 Play Building of Burj Khalifa Dec 30, 2009 Play Video: Electronics fiesta as Gitex opens Oct 01, 2016 12Images The 2017 Shanghai Auto Show Apr 25, 2017 20Images 24th Arabian Travel Market begins in Dubai Apr 24, 2017 9Images 2017 Cityscape Abu Dhabi kicks off Apr 18, 2017 8Images Massive development at Abu Dhabi airport Mar 11, 2017 TheNumber $3.7bn The figure Facebook's profit doubled to in final three months of 2016 Currency Converter first-currency currencyAEDDinarRupee= first-currency currencyINRDinarRupee Most Popular on Gulf News UAE bans produce from these countries Your guide 2017 UAE holidays UAE visa on arrival for Indians from May 1 90-minute blackout hits Dubai Mall Trio jailed for raping sleeping roommate Woman wakes up after 80 days in coma Heaviest woman’s sister seeks UAE help Bride spurns groom and weds stranger For UAE expats, no Haj permits this year Close Recommended For You Holidaymaking amid Duterte’s war on drugsPUBLISHED ON Apr 26, 2017 $100m Atlantis renovation to begin July 2PUBLISHED ON Apr 25, 2017 First grade fall-accident student laid to restPUBLISHED ON Apr 26, 2017 Feedback Get The Paper Our Apps Mobile friendly version Our location Advanced Search Sitemap MY GULF NEWS GulfNews.com is the most widely read newspaper, and online site in English in the Middle East.

Apple’s ‘Today at Apple’ Sessions To A Cater Wide Audience Across Various Fields Apple’s educational program will  be held by the company’s highly trained members, including the world class artists also taking part in various cities across the globe.

"With the recent announcement by Apple that wireless charging will become a standard feature in the next iPhone, we are finally at the threshold of mainstream adoption," said Mr. Dubzinski. "Dan Stone has a proven track record of success and is uniquely qualified to help guide Powermat to the next level of service delivery. Under his guidance, CompuCom has enjoyed a reputation for delivering unparalleled IT support for enterprise clients and their end users. We look forward to benefitting from his experience and guidance." It's unclear exactly which 'recent announcement' Dubzinski is referring to as Apple has not publicly announced wireless charging as a feature of the next generation iPhone. Apple did recently join the Wireless Power Consortium behind Qi and is now being listed as an official member on their website; however, that's hardly announcing wireless charging as a standard feature for its upcoming smartphone. Wireless charging is rumored as a key feature of the iPhone 8 and Apple is said to have at least five groups working on different wireless charging technologies. Earlier today a report suggested that Apple was having overheating issues with the new wireless charging modules which could contribute to delayed release. Let's hope wireless charging is a 'standard feature' as Dubzinski indicates! Please follow iClarified on Twitter, Facebook, Google+, or RSS for updates.

If The Apple iPhone 8 has aluminium backing ...like another RUMOR suggests...ANY WIRELESS CHARGING will not take place!! CANNOT INDUCT ENERGY THROUGH ALUMINUM!! www.nomorecords.com Reply · Like · Mark as Spam Kenny - 10 hours ago Just curious do we know if that wireless charging that works up to 15 ft away can work threw aluminum? It would have to some otherwise you should have to have the back of your phone facing the base at all times for it to work. From the rumors that's the type apple is mostly pushing toward so maybe it uses that aluminum to actually catch the wireless charge. Nokia patented a wireless charging tech a long time ago that used the cellular waves to pull energy and charge so if that's how this works it could just need exposed antenna bands which it will have and the phone can have an aluminum shell. Reply · Like · Mark as Spam Huh? - 9 hours ago Huh? WTF are you talking about? None of what you're saying is even close to having commercial applications yet. Wireless charging as used here just means you don't have to connect the phone to a cable, but you will have to put it on a charging mat or base. Reply · Like · Mark as Spam huh? - 9 hours ago Plus aluminum can't "catch" a charge, whatever that means... as David pointed out, aluminum cannot carry a charge. Dude...

Wireless Charging, OLED Screen Blamed By Denisse Moreno On 04/25/17 AT 2:39 PM Close Yet another report claims Apple will delay the release of the upcoming iPhone 8, which is expected in September. Nikkei reported Tuesday the 10th anniversary iPhone may not launch until late October or November. Suppliers reportedly are struggling to perfect key components, including the iPhone’s rumored OLED display, wireless charging and new printed circuit boards, the report said. Read: iPhone 8 Release Date Rumors: Apple Working On Advanced Camera Systems, Curved Screens, Stainless Steel Frame Samsung has prepared 75 million small-size OLED panels for Apple this year, IHS Markit reported. However, the Korean company apparently is having trouble supplying the OLED displays, sources told Nikkei. "There might be a one- to two-month delay in Samsung's production of OLED panels for Apple," IHS Markit analyst Brian Huh  said. "Samsung originally planned to begin churning out OLED panels in May but now the schedule will likely be pushed back to the end of June or sometime in July." Apple and its suppliers are also working to patch up overheating problems with wireless charging components, backing up previous rumors pointing to a wireless charging feature on the iPhone 8. Read: iPhone 8 vs. Galaxy S8: Apple Wants Higher-End Display Than Samsung’s Flagship Has The tech giant also is struggling with the new printed circuit boards. "There is a new design for a much smaller printed circuit board to allow a more powerful battery for this upcoming iPhone ... but there are still some quality issues to overcome to achieve smooth mass production," IDC analyst Sean Kao told Nikkei. The report comes after KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said Monday Apple will launch in September but will face "severe supply shortages" for some time. He predicts mass production of the 10th anniversary device will be delayed until October-November, rather than the traditional August-September timeframes. Why Will The iPhone 8 Be Delayed? Kuo said the  OLED panel, 3D sensing cameras, 10-nanometer A11 processor, and the all-new 3D Touch module on the iPhone 8 are reasons for Apple’s delay. Previously, Cowen and Co. analyst Timothy Arcuri said in a note Apple was struggling with embedding the Touch ID into the device’s display. A report by iGeneration last month said the iPhone 8 could be delayed because of key components of the new 3D-sensing front camera. Apple is expected to reveal the iPhone 8 and two LCD iPhone models, iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus, in September.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 25 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Spindle Names Brian Sathianathan to Advisory Board /EINPresswire.com/ — SCOTTSDALE, AZ–(Marketwired – Apr 25, 2017) – Spindle, Inc. (OTCQB: SPDL) („Spindle” or the „Company”), an emerging provider of comprehensive digital commerce solutions, today announced that Brian Sathianathan has joined the Company’s advisory board. Sathianathan is an accomplished technology entrepreneur and investor well known in the Venture Capital community. From 2001-2008, he worked at Apple where he became one of the early key members of Apple’s Secret Products working on the iPhone. After architecting and building their internal enterprise platforms and security applications, he moved into the consumer product area and led software development teams at Apple’s Secret Product (NPI) group for a few years. His team worked on the first iPhone’s security and provisioning system that outlasted against device unlock attacks.  After leaving Apple, he was the Founder & President of Avot Media which enabled streaming video into a wide variety of mobile smartphones and tablets, where he oversaw both local and international revenue growth, resulting in a sale to publicly traded Smith Micro. In 2011, he joined Turner Broadcasting, and helped start its Media Camp, Turner’s startup incubator that focused on investing in and developing digital-media startups. During his tenure, the group engaged on the business side resulting in 13 seed investments into media startups. In November 2013, he cofounded Iterate.ai (https://www.iterate.ai/), an innovation lab for emerging technologies. Iterate discovers and curates emerging technologies, then implements proof-of-concept tests (a.k.a. proof-of-value tests) for a global partner base. Close partners include a few dozen large companies representing beauty, media, accessories and apparel, DIY, and footwear categories representing $600 billion in revenue. For large companies, Iterate reduces the time, costs and risks associated with analyzing and deploying innovative startup technologies. At the same time, startups get special visibility and credibility. Brian Sathianathan stated, „I’m excited to join the Spindle team at what I believe is an opportunistic time. Having just completed the sale of my company CoverCake, I have a strong vested interest, along with Spindle management, in our collective success. I firmly believe that the combination of the strengths of the CoverCake machine intelligence and backend solutions will dramatically enhance both data procuration and refinement for the CATALYST Platform. This is as a very positive and tangible step towards the mutual creation of a powerful and disruptive digital commerce engine that should provide enhanced marketing tools for CATALYST’s internal programs and their merchants alike, driving revenue for both.”  Spindle Interim Chief Executive Officer Dr. Jack Scott stated, „I’m extremely pleased to welcome Brian to the Spindle team. I’m a big believer that a company’s value can be best measured by the quality of its people. Brian is not only a highly accomplished and well regarded technology innovator, but he is a consummate professional. I expect his addition to be the first of what should be more to come, all of whom will share the common goal of value creation.” Scott concluded, „As one of the company’s largest investors, I think it should be abundantly clear that my goals are directly aligned with those of our shareholders. I also appreciate the importance of corporate transparency in terms of communicating with investors, with a full understanding of what it was like for me as an early shareholder looking from the outside in. With this in mind, and on the heels of having just filed our 2016 Form 10K, I am currently working on a communication to advise you of recent progress. In the meantime, our team remains focused on the company’s underlying fundamentals, which I believe have been improved with the addition of CoverCake to our digital marketing arsenal, and Brian Sathianathan to our Advisory Board.”  About Spindle Spindle is an innovator of merchant and consumer-facing commerce solutions focused on the Small and Medium-sized Business (SMB) market. The CATALYST Marketing System components and CATALYST IP were included in the asset acquisition from Catalyst Business Development, Inc. which Spindle, Inc. completed in 2015. It is focused on payment processing services and integrating value-added capabilities that enhance merchant revenue and increase consumer loyalty, experience, and stickiness. Spindle is taking a unique approach to orchestrating commerce transactions of all types by leveraging best-in-class technology, multiple solutions for vertical markets, and a deeply experienced payments management team to define and drive the way commerce transactions will be performed in the future. This commerce experience will be independent of mechanism, unifying a consumer’s experience across all platforms (mobile, browser, kiosk, etc.), taking today’s solutions to a new level via technology integrations and strategic partnerships.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Industry Apple Heads For A Big Change For Its Stores – A Complete Redesign Meant To Change The Entire Feel Of The Place By Zarmeen Shahzad 16 hours ago 21Shares Share Tweet Submit Apple is heading for a big change as it changes the outlook of its top stores for the first time in 15 years. It is adding conference rooms, meeting rooms, new video screens and living trees to its 100 biggest locations. It is also changing the name of the Genius Bar to ‘Genius Grove’. Pretty groovy right? The top 500 retail stores will also be offering ‘educational sessions’ now. The company has branded these sessions as ‘Today at Apple’. These sessions will be launching by the end of May but we still aren’t clear how these sessions will differ from the current creative workshops offered. Apple Gets Groovy With Stores The changes are based on the redesign that the company brought forward last year at the Union Square Park in San Francisco. So why this change? Apparently the company wishes to create the look and the atmosphere of a town square. It wants to be a whole other world. The conference spaces are meant to be utilized by small business owners and startups to get advice from developers and successful entrepreneurs. People at the Genius Grove will have very specific and specialized roles. These people will be able to offer help with skills like music and photography. Related ‘Today At Apple’ Sessions Expanding To Every Apple Store Starting May According to what Angela Ahrendts, Apple’s senior vice president of retail said at last year’s San Francisco event, “The over-arching vision of the future of Apple retail … is what do we want Apple’s role in the community to be. The store becomes one with the community.” Ahrendts is a former CEO of Burberry and she joined Apple in 2013 to run the ‘strategic direction, expansion, and operation’ of Apple’s retail and online divisions. Apple has big hopes from this change and according to Ahrendts, “This is more than just a store. We want people to say, ‘Hey, meet me at Apple’.” Well goodluck Apple. source Share Tweet Submit <a href="//titangate-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=d4114a3168&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" ><img src="//titangate-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=538336708&cs=d4114a3168&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" border="0" alt=""></a> Related Intel X299 HEDT Platform For Skylake X and Kaby Lake X Processors Announcement on 30th May, Launch on 26th June – Reviews Go Live on 16th June 16 hours ago 106 Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite Release Date Revealed; New Characters Confirmed 16 hours ago 10 SWBFII Story Is About Perspective & Understanding Rather Than Convincing You The Death Star Was Good 16 hours ago 15 Middle-Earth Shadow of War New Gameplay Video Focuses On Weapons And Gear 16 hours ago 12 Resident Evil 7 Not A Hero DLC Delayed; Capcom Working On More Additional Content 16 hours ago 13 Sniper Ghost Warrior 3 Releases Without Multiplayer As “Not to Dilute any Potential From the Single Player” 16 hours ago 23 Several Overwatch Maps In Development, Three To Likely Release This Year 16 hours ago 11 Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

The hands-on sessions, called “Today at Apple”, will be led by highly-trained team members (and in select cities world-class artists, photographers and musicians) teaching sessions from basics and how-to lessons to professional-level programs. The free programs will focus on the features of Apple products that customers love most, across all skill levels and ages. For example, an iPhone user interested in photography can start with six how-to sessions that cover shooting, organising, editing, and more. More advanced photographers can join experiential Photo Walks that leave the store to dive into techniques including light and shadow, portraits and storytelling. Apple will also offer special programs for families and educators. Teachers can come together for Teacher Tuesday to learn new ways to incorporate technology into their classrooms, and aspiring coders of all ages can learn how to code in Swift, Apple’s programming language for iOS and Mac apps. Families can join weekend Kids Hour sessions ranging from music-making to coding with robots. Small business owners can engage with global and local entrepreneurs in the new Business Circuits program. Many sessions will be taught by new Creative Pros, the liberal arts equivalent to Apple’s technical Geniuses. Each Creative Pro is an expert in one or more areas of the arts, and highly trained to pass along their knowledge to Apple users of all levels. “Today at Apple” offers programs with more than 60 different sessions in creative skills. Studio Hours is Apple’s version of a professor’s office hours. Creative Pros host 90-minute sessions on topics from art and design to documents and presentations. Anyone is welcome to bring in a personal project for advice from experts, or to use the space to work alongside others. Photo or Sketch Walks help attendees go beyond capturing moments by exploring new techniques hands on as they interact in their local community. Photo Walks include sessions such as framing architecture or capturing action on video, while Sketch Walks explore observational drawings, watercolour and brush techniques, and more. Kids Hour is designed to spark imagination and creativity through fun, hands-on projects. Sessions include coding with Sphero robots, Creating Music with GarageBand, and Making Movies Together with iMovie. Coding sessions are meant to introduce anyone to coding through Swift Playgrounds, an iPad app designed to make coding interactive and fun for beginners. These sessions will explore coding concepts with the same code professional developers use every day. Photo Labs bring in talented photographers to experiment with new techniques and styles or uncover a new point of view in hands-on sessions. Similarly, Music Labs explore different genres and beats to introduce new tools to musicians of all levels.* Pro Series take advanced users on a deep dive into Final Cut Pro® X and Logic Pro® X with sessions on colour correction and grading to post production, or audio mixing to editing for emotion, and more.* Perspectives and Performances, offered at select stores, features influential artists and musicians talking about their creative process or sharing their talents live. “Today at Apple” will launch worldwide in May, with sessions in every store.

Waste360 Staff | Apr 25, 2017 Apple has released its Environmental Responsibility Report, which outlines the company’s environmental and sustainability efforts. As part of the report, Apple has announced a plan to make iPhones and computers entirely from recycled materials. Currently, Apple forces the recyclers it works with to shred iPhones and computers, turning the materials into tiny shards of metal, plastic and glass instead of repairing or reusing the products. The shredded pieces from the products are then sorted into commodities grade materials and sold and used for production stock in new products. MOTHERBOARD has more details: Apple released its Environmental Responsibility Report Wednesday, an annual grandstanding effort that the company uses to position itself as a progressive, environmentally friendly company. Behind the scenes, though, the company undermines attempts to prolong the lifespan of its products. Apple's new moonshot plan is to make iPhones and computers entirely out of recycled materials by putting pressure on the recycling industry to innovate. But documents obtained by Motherboard using Freedom of Information requests show that Apple's current practices prevent recyclers from doing the most environmentally friendly thing they could do: Salvage phones and computers from the scrap heap.

These hands-on sessions, collectively called “Today at Apple,” have been offered at Apple’s flagship Union Square store in San Francisco since last year, with topics ranging from photo/video to music, coding, art, design and more. Apple says these sessions cater to all skill levels/ages and include how-to lessons, professional-level courses and more. The free sessions will be led by highly-trained team members. “Many sessions will be taught by new Creative Pros, the liberal arts equivalent to Apple’s technical Geniuses,” said the Cupertino firm. “Each Creative Pro is an expert in one or more areas of the arts, and highly trained to pass along their knowledge to Apple users of all levels.” The initiative focuses on the features of Apple products customers love most. For example, an iPhone user interested in photography can start with six How To sessions that cover shooting, organizing, editing and more. More advanced photographers can join experiential Photo Walks that leave the store to dive into techniques including light and shadow, portraits and storytelling. Going further, a Photo Lab features accomplished photographers on topics such as capturing candids, building a brand on social media or simply sharing their perspective. In select cities, the sessions will be taught by “world-class artists, photographers and musicians.” Apple will be rolling out special software to support the initiative in all of its stores, many of which will be changed literally overnight. Special programs for families and educators will be provided, too. Teacher Tuesday, for example, will teach educators new ways to incorporate Apple technology into their classrooms. Other examples include courses for Apple’s programming language Swift and weekend sessions for families covering topics from music making to coding with robots. Even small business owners can engage with global and local entrepreneurs via a new Business Circuits program, available in select stores only. Some of the more than 60 different topics in creative skills include the following sessions: Studio Hours are Apple’s version of a professor’s office hours.

Perspectives and Performances, offered at select stores, feature influential artists and musicians talking about their creative process or sharing their talents live. To provide customers with the best possible educational experience, the company will outfit each store with mobile screens created by its design team, along with updated seating/sound and wall displays to showcase the products. “Today at Apple” will launch worldwide in May, with sessions in every store. Angela Ahrendts, Apple’s Senior Vice President of Retail in charge of the company’s physical and online stores, said in a video interview with CBS’s “This Morning” that the company wishes to educate and inspire the communities it serves. The aim, she says, is to create a modern-day town square where customers engage with their devices and their communities while learning new things to take their skill to the next level. Here’s an excerpt from the interview: A lot of the big online guys have said they’re opening stores. Amazon’s investing in stores. Google’s investing in stores. Starbucks figured it out, you know? Being a gathering place for—right? ‘Meet me at Starbucks’. And you know, I’ve told the teams, ‘I’ll know we’ve done a really, really great job if the next generation, if Gen Z says, “Meet me at Apple. Did you see what’s going on at Apple today?”’ Asked whether that apply to Android and Samsung users too, Ahrendts responded by saying, “Absolutely. Absolutely. And we have an incredible trade up program…”. And here are a few video segments from CBS’s interview with Ahrendts. Apple is also unveiling a redesigned store outside the world’s tallest building in Dubai. Ahrendts collaborated closely with Jony Ive, Apple’s Chief Design Officer, who created Apple’s next-generation store design that first came to light with the launch of the Union Square outlet. It’s the most significant redesign of the Apple Store since its inception 15+ years ago. Ahrendts, 56, is now one of the highest-paid executives at Apple and in the country for that matter.

A wind farm in Eastern Oregon. (courtesy Wikipedia) Apple signed a deal earlier this year to purchase 200 megawatts of wind power for its Prineville, Ore., data center, adding to its investments in Oregon’s data center country. The deal was disclosed last week in Apple’s annual environmental responsibility report (PDF, find Appendix B), and flagged by The Oregonian Monday. Apple operates a massive data center complex in Prineville, about three hours south and east of Portland, where several other companies like Facebook and Google have also set up shop. Construction on the first phase of the Montague Wind Power Project is scheduled to begin in September, according to a report last month in the Portland Business Journal. It will be located in Gilliam County, Ore., in the high desert east of the Cascade Mountains nearby several other wind projects. In its report, Apple said it will be powering 94 percent of its Prineville data center with wind power, and called the Montague Wind Power Project “the first Apple-created wind project.” An Apple representative did not immediately respond to a request for clarification on whether or not Apple commissioned the Montague Wind Power Project, or if it was just the exclusive customer for the first phase, but I’ll update this if more details arrive.

The company is launching a new layout that will be used in all its large retail locations worldwide. It features creative classes, living trees and conference rooms. The initiative was unveiled today as Apple launched the first redesigned Apple Store in Dubai. The team responsible for the endeavour is led by Angela Ahrendts, Apple's senior vice president of retail. The significant effort is meant to evolve Apple stores into a space which people can visit as part of their regular lives, learning new things and meeting with others. Apple treats its Stores as another of its products, Ahrendts said to CBS News today. "This is the largest product that Apple produces," the executive explained. The company takes the presentation if its Stores so seriously because they're responsible for showcasing the rest of its range, including other devices and Apple's reputation for simplicity. Apple is transforming its Apple Stores into shared work and learning environments Apple The retail vision Ahrendts is debuting in Dubai today turns existing Apple Stores into a kind of central space built to serve local communities. Beyond the trees, meeting spaces, conference rooms and digital displays being introduced, Apple's also launching a new "Today at Apple" program of educational sessions. These will be held in all Apple Stores worldwide. They'll include presentations on a range of topics spanning Apple's creative ambitions. Led by Apple "Creative Pros" with deep and specialised knowledge in their subjects, the sessions will cover art, design, music, photography and programming. Each class will be free and available for anyone to participate in. Apple is transforming its Apple Stores into shared work and learning environments Apple According to Ahrendts, the initiative will expand the Apple Store concept to create a "modern-day town square." Rather than just sell Apple devices, the company's stores will become shared learning and working environments for the entire community. "'Today at Apple' is one of the ways we’re evolving our experience to better serve local customers and entrepreneurs," said Ahrendts. "We’re creating a modern-day town square, where everyone is welcome in a space where the best of Apple comes together to connect with one another, discover a new passion, or take their skill to the next level. We think it will be a fun and enlightening experience for everyone who joins." Apple is transforming its Apple Stores into shared work and learning environments Apple Alongside the Creative Pros, Apple will also be shuffling the roles of its other Store staff. It wants customers to view the Store and the people within as open and approachable, leading it to retrain employees with expertise in creative skills. The company's Genius Bar helpdesk has been renamed "Genius Grove" and given an expanded purpose. Reflecting Apple's new focus on bringing creativity into its stores, Genius Grove staff members will be able to offer help beyond problems with Apple devices. They'll also offer advice on effectively using them, providing assistance in artistic fields such as photography and music production. Apple is transforming its Apple Stores into shared work and learning environments Apple Apple will be converting 100 of its larger stores to the new format. The remaining smaller locations will receive select features, such as Today at Apple, but will lack the meeting rooms and trees owing to space constraints. The design is similar to the changes made to Apple's Union Square store in San Francisco last year, indicating the company has been experimenting with the new look for several months. The Today at Apple program will launch in May with more than 60 sessions in creative skills. Visitors are welcome to bring in personal projects to get advice from Apple's experts. The company insists the stores should be used by everyone, irrespective of mobile platform allegiance.

The tech giant from Cupertino has filed papers with the California DMV to receive approval to test driverless cars on public roads. Those papers were published online, and we have learned that the company wants to use Logitech game controllers in those vehicles. Meanwhile, other reports announce that the people who will be allowed to use Apple’s autonomous driving vehicles on public roads have experience in the robotics industry, and they include former employees of Tesla and NASA. It is not surprising that the makers of the iPhone hired specialists to test its autonomous driving vehicles on public roads, but this goes to show that the company is focused on its effort in this direction. The names of those employees have been removed from the documents that were published online, but a few have managed to see them and search their resumes online. According to CNBC, several of those six people accredited to use Apple’s self-driving automobiles used to work for Bosch, Tesla, and NASA. Interestingly, we are surprised that the makers of the iMac have not hired talent from Waymo or Uber, two tech companies that have a broader experience in the autonomous vehicle domain at the moment. Regardless, recruiting specialists in driverless car technology is something tough these days, because most employees in the field are well compensated, and few things motivate them to switch jobs. Just like its rivals at Google, Apple does not intend to build and sell cars that drive themselves, but to develop a technology that will help a conventional vehicle become capable of operating without a human behind the wheel. In this direction, Google is significantly ahead of its rivals in Cupertino, and its spinoff, Waymo, has already offered free rides to interested people in Phoenix, Arizona. apple car Apple self-driving cars Tesla NASA autonomous car technology autonomous   Mercedes-Benz Model Nomenclature is Getting Ridiculous How to Get Rid of Gasoline Odor in Your Car Five Heaviest Convertible Sports Cars Available In Europe in 2017 If Peugeot Citroen Buys Opel it's all Downhill for Volkswagen BMW Winter Driving Tip: Eco Pro On, Coasting Off Headwave TAG Helmet Music and Navigation System Reviewed Why the 2018 Dodge Challenger SRT Demon Is Late to the Party Engine Break-In: What You Need to Know Platform Sharing - When Expensive Cars Get Cheaper Platforms And Viceversa On Electric Harleys and New Generations The Dos and Don’ts of Washing a Motorcycle, Part One Five Lightest All-Wheel-Drive SUVs Available In Europe in 2017 Spare The Tires: Why Most New Cars Are Not Built For Road Trips The Dos and Don’ts of Washing a Motorcycle, Part Two (Final) Eight Of The Most Anticipated Debuts At The 2017 New York Auto Show The End of Sedans is Nigh!

StarStarStarStarNone Author Carter Dotson Posted On2017-04-25 13:00:50 3.5 stars, Accessories, News, Ratings, Reviews For serious mobile gamers, the need for a good headset is ever-increasing. There's the streaming community, of course, with various platforms for streaming mobile games out there. Games like Vainglory [Free] work better with the ability to chat with teammates. And if you get games of Modern Combat Versus going, you'll want to chat with folks on Discord while you do so. But the gaming headset market is such an interesting market because it's so ripe for disruption by companies that know how to make good headphones. Popular brands like Razer are far more about branding and style with their headphones than with sound quality. As well, older gamers or those with a more subdued sense of style might not like the loud designs that these use. So, competitors have a blue ocean of opportunity to compete in this market. We've seen the HyperX Cloud, which took a smart path by utilizing a solid OEM headphone and adapting it to have a microphone. And of course, intriguing options exist with external microphones such as the ModMic. Sennheiser is one of the oldest and most respected headphone companies around. They've been making great headphones for decades, and the Sennheiser HD600 family remains a top pick for audiophiles. My Sennheiser HD580, an older model in that family, has an impressive natural sound to it once you give it the proper amplification. But Sennheiser also has made some entries into the consumer range, with their Sennheiser Momentum headphones, and the Sennheiser HD598 family providing consumer-friendly, entry-level audiophile sound at a great entry price. Sennheiser is making bigger steps in the PC gaming headset category, and one of their latest entries is the PC 373D. Now, Sennheiser has made a few entries into the gaming headset market, and there seems to be a similar family of headphones in the Game Zero, Game One, and PC 373D. The Game Zero is closed back, the Game One is open-back and features an analog cable, while the 373D comes with one cable, a digital dongle that you plug into your source. For iOS users, what's cool is that if you have a USB camera connection kit adapter, the USB dongle works natively on iOS. The downside is that this adapter is $29 (unofficial ones, such as this handy cable, keep getting broken by iOS updates, thanks Apple) so if you don't have one already then it might not be in your wheelhouse. The connection into the headphones is 2.5mm TRRS, so you can get an analog-only cable for these. With a 50 ohm impedance and 116 dB sensitivity, you should get near-ideal volume from most consumer-grade headphone outputs. The plug design is such that it looks like it'll be tough to get an aftermarket cable from anyone but Sennheiser. Sennheiser's cables are certainly affordable enough for $16.95 for a TRRS termination (which you can use an adapter to get it in separate TRS/TRS headphone/mic connections), but it's not on Amazon if you wanted something super fast. Still, I'd put in an order for this cable if you want to use it on everything you have, though the USB dongle will work ideally on PC, and should be functional on mobile and PS4. If Apple ever approved a micro-USB to Lightning cable for DACs (the micro-USB adapter that Apple sells is not for external accessories) then this would be perfect for the 373D. The PC 373D's USB dongle has a clever design, where the 2.5mm TRRS cable, which is 1.7m long, terminates in the dongle and has a micro USB female port. What this means is that you can customize the length depending on the length of the micro-USB cable you choose. The included micro-USB cable is 1.2m, but you can use your own if you want a shorter or possibly even longer connection to your source. How about volume control? The volume control on the cups is an analog volume attenuator, which may not be ideal as you could be losing some dynamic range with this kind of volume control. Additionally, the lowest volume is not a true mute, so if you want to use this as a quick way to hear the outside world, it won't do that. It feels like a suboptimal combo, combining the possible downsides of digital volume control (such as if the volume being output to the headphones is just changing the digital volume or if it's affecting the actual analog volume going to the headphones) with the weaknesses of passive volume attenuation. The microphone mutes when you raise it upward, which is a nifty function. You can hear an audible click, too. Despite the headphones being open-back, you don't have to worry about the microphone picking up audio leaking out. What does it mean for headphones to be open-back? It means that sound will leak out from the ear cups of these headphones. The benefit is that you get a more natural, wider sound. Closed-back headphones, while ideal for portable usage and often for enhancing bass, can suffer from resonance issues due to the closed earcups. The PC 373D is not meant for on-the-go usage, but primarily for home usage. What is interesting is that these headphones feature rather strong bass, making them isolate better than they otherwise would. Isolating low frequencies is the toughest form of isolation to get, and these seem to do a good enough job at that. If you like hip-hop and modern music, these feel particularly attuned for these genres. But the bass doesn't feel as tight and controlled as other headphones in the audiophile range that I've used, it has more of a boomy quality that feels like it blends too much into the mids for my preferences. These headphones have a quality soundstage to them. It might pale to something like you might get from an open AKG headphone, but it's still rather good for most consumer-grade headphones. The headband could be a bit denser, as it feels like my head is touching the headband up top, not providing enough cushioning. The earpads, which are velour, feature sizable ear cups that should contain even the largest of ears. One of the things I love about my Sennheiser HD580 headphones are that they're modularly designed to where you could actually assemble a set yourself with spare parts sold by Sennheiser. While I don't know if you could do that with the 373D, the good news is that you can buy replacement earpads for sure. The headband doesn't look like it's easily replaceable, and Sennheiser doesn't list part numbers for everything, but contacting their support should help you out. At worst, you have a 2-year international warranty with these headphones, and Sennheiser generally makes durable products. The PC 373D does feel optimally designed for PC. One annoying factor is that while the Dolby Headphone seems to use some form of internal surround on PC (a test in Windows plays back all surround speakers), that means that it only works on PC. Dolby Headphone can work with stereo sources, but the button to activate it won't work on non-PC platforms. The HyperX Cloud II's virtual 7.1 didn't use a 7.1 source, but at least it was platform agnostic if you wanted that boost in surround field. I don't think the effect is worth it, particularly here where the sound feels like it gets too tinny and compressed to be any good despite the advantages in soundstaging. As well, you lose configuration options for sidetone, noise canceling, and basic equalization if you're not on Windows. Moving some of these options to the dongle would have been fantastic. The problem with the PC 373D is just that it sits in an odd middle ground of quality. The headphones sound better than many headsets, and have a sleek look to them that's mature without being too mature. But you can do better if you want wider sound, and if you want more bass. And the various gaming features are of limited utility depending on your setup. And the exclusion of the analog cable feels like a missing opportunity to make these an even more versatile product. While I like the headset microphone and its functionality, for the $250 MSRP (though they're about $210 on Amazon as of writing), you might be better off getting a set of headphones that you like – even something like the Sennheiser HD598 which can normally be found in the $100-$150 range, and bringing your own microphone in the ModMic, an external clip-on mic, or an unofficial third-party option like this, might not be a better option. But then again, if these drawbacks don't sound like they'd be a weak point in your setup, you could do a lot worse than the PC 373D.

After a couple years or so they're creaking really badly. Possible a little silicone lubricant will help, but the build quality on these turned out to be surprisingly janky for the price. I have several sets of headphones and haven't had this issue with any. Hopefully they've fixed this going forward.

On April 18, the court ruled that a woman who had a purchased an iPad 2 Air in 2015 and returned the device to Apple due to problems with its Wi-Fi connectivity was entitled to a new device. Apple had attempted to give the woman a refurbished iPad, as the company allows for in the terms of service of its Apple Care programs, but the woman refused to accept it. "A replacement iPad is, despite everything that Apple has argued about it, not a new iPad, but a replacement," the judge wrote. "Apple is not selling ‘replacements’ as new in the market.” Get Data Sheet, Fortune's technology newsletter. Apple (aapl) sells refurbished devices through its authorized partners such as mobile phone carriers. Apple did not immediately return a request for comment on the ruling. A civil lawsuit has been filed on similar grounds in federal court in California. The case is set for trial in December 2018.

The programs will focus on the features of popular Apple products and are intended to be accessible for people across all skill levels and ages. Apple says these sessions will be led by highly-trained Apple team members, many of whom are “Creative Pros,” the “liberal arts equivalent to Apple’s technical Geniuses.” For example, Apple says there are a variety of programs related to photography that can appeal to people of all skill levels. For beginners, there will be six “How To” sessions that cover related skills such as shooting, organizing and editing. For more experienced photographers, Apple is offering “Photo Walks” that take customers outside of stores to develop more advanced techniques, including light and shadow, storytelling and portraits. And finally, a “Photo Lab” session will feature accomplished photographers who will discuss their own perspectives and tips, including how to capture candids or building a brand on social media. Some other programs that will be offered include: “Kids Hour” teaches kids to code with Sphero toy robots, create music with the GarageBand app or make movies with one another through iMovie “Perspectives and Performance,” available in select cities, which features “world-class” musicians, artists and photographers will discuss their creative processes and give live performances “Studio Hours,” described as “Apple’s version of a professor’s office hours,” which are 90-minute sessions on topics ranging from documents and presentations to art and design “Pro Series,” intended for advanced users, dives into Final Cut Pro X and Logic Pro X for tips on colour correction, grading, post-production, audio mixing, editing and more To host the new programs, each store will receive some upgrades in the form of new mobile screens known as “Forum Displays,” updated seating and sound. A new store is also being opened in the Middle East called the Apple Dubai Mall, which will offer a slew of programming including ‘Today at Apple.’ In other Apple educational news, the tech giant announced Monday that it’s launching Apple Teacher, a free instructional program designed to help teachers and students.

The California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) last week mistakenly revealed the names of Apple employees who were granted permission to act as "driver/operators" during the iPhone maker's self-driving car testing across the state. On Monday, The Wall Street Journal and Business Insider, which both obtained a copy of the Apple testing permit, published the names of the six Apple employees who can act as drivers. CNBC found that most of those Apple employees previously worked at NASA and electric carmaker Tesla. Although Apple has declined to comment about its plans for self-driving cars, news reports over the last few years have suggested that the company is working on such technology. Whether Apple is developing its own car, however, is debated. Most recent reports say Apple is instead focused on technology that it could sell to carmakers to put into their self-driving cars. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter Earlier this month, the California DMV granted Apple a permit to operate self-driving cars across the state. Apple joins several other companies including Waymo, a subsidiary of Google parent company Alphabet, in testing the technology. Apple has been quietly hiring employees from Tesla and other carmakers for quite some time. Tesla (tsla) CEO Elon Musk has gone so far as to call Apple a "Tesla Graveyard," where some of, what he said, underperforming former employees go to work on cars. Apple's newly revealed hires have impressive resumes. One of the employees on the California permit is Shilpa Gulati, who describes herself as an "experienced roboticist," according to CNBC. She previously worked at conglomerate Bosch on "motion planning algorithms for self-driving cars," and also helped create a vehicle that will be used to explore one of Jupiter's moons. Jeremy Ma, who is also listed on the permit, worked at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, according to CNBC. Christopher Gadda previously worked at Tesla in an unidentified role. All of the Apple employees are cleared by the state to sit behind the wheel of the company's self-driving car technology and to test its performance. They'll also analyze how well the technology behaves in real-world driving circumstances.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Take a Look at Apple's Angela Ahrendts Interview with 'CBS this Morning' (The Full Interview now Available) | Main | Apple's Tom Gruber, Co-Founder of Siri, Spoke at TED2017 Today about Augmented Memories and more » April 25, 2017 Apple Stores to launch new "Today at Apple" Educational Programs Worldwide in May   Yesterday and earlier today Patently Apple posted reports regarding the CBS interview with Apple's SVP of Retail Angela Ahrendts where she described wanting to create a new atmosphere at Apple so that people would say, let's meet at Apple. Uniquely, just as the interiew with CBS ended airing on the west coast, Apple officialy launched their latest Apple Store program simply called "Today at Apple." The new feature will be bringing new experiences to every Apple Store over time. The program launches globally in May. Our report presents you with five Jumbo photos covering the new program.   Apple today announced plans to launch dozens of new educational sessions next month in all 495 Apple stores ranging in topics from photo and video to music, coding, art and design and more. The hands-on sessions, collectively called "Today at Apple," will be led by highly-trained team members, and in select cities world-class artists, photographers and musicians, teaching sessions from basics and how-to lessons to professional-level programs.   "At the heart of every Apple Store is the desire to educate and inspire the communities we serve," said Angela Ahrendts, Apple's senior vice president, Retail. "'Today at Apple' is one of the ways we're evolving our experience to better serve local customers and entrepreneurs. We're creating a modern-day town square, where everyone is welcome in a space where the best of Apple comes together to connect with one another, discover a new passion, or take their skill to the next level. We think it will be a fun and enlightening experience for everyone who joins."   The free programs focus on the features of Apple products customers love most, across all skill levels and ages. For example, an iPhone user interested in photography can start with six How To sessions that cover shooting, organizing, editing and more. More advanced photographers can join experiential Photo Walks that leave the store to dive into techniques including light and shadow, portraits and storytelling. Going further, a Photo Lab features accomplished photographers on topics such as capturing candids, building a brand on social media or simply sharing their perspective.   Apple will also offer special programs for families and educators. Teachers can come together for Teacher Tuesday to learn new ways to incorporate technology into their classrooms, or aspiring coders of all ages can learn how to code in Swift, Apple's programming language for iOS and Mac apps. Families can join weekend Kids Hour sessions ranging from music making to coding with robots. Small business owners can engage with global and local entrepreneurs in the new Business Circuits program.   Many sessions will be taught by new Creative Pros, the liberal arts equivalent to Apple's technical Geniuses. Each Creative Pro is an expert in one or more areas of the arts, and highly trained to pass along their knowledge to Apple users of all levels.   "Today at Apple" Programming   "Today at Apple" offers programs with more than 60 different sessions in creative skills, including:   Studio Hours are Apple's version of a professor's office hours. Creative Pros host 90-minute sessions on topics from art and design to documents and presentations. Anyone is welcome to bring in a personal project for advice from experts, or to use the space to work alongside others.   Photo or Sketch Walks help attendees go beyond capturing moments by exploring new techniques hands-on as they interact in their local community. Photo Walks include sessions such as framing architecture or capturing action on video, while Sketch Walks explore observational drawings, watercolor and brush techniques, and more.   Kids Hour is designed to spark imagination and creativity through fun, hands-on projects. Sessions include coding with Sphero robots, Creating Music with GarageBand and Making Movies Together with iMovie.   Coding sessions are meant to introduce anyone to coding through Swift Playgrounds, an iPad app designed to make coding interactive and fun for beginners. These sessions will explore coding concepts with the same code professional developers use every day.*   Photo Labs bring in talented photographers to experiment with new techniques and styles or uncover a new point of view in hands-on sessions. Similarly, Music Labs explore different genres and beats to introduce new tools to musicians of all levels.   Pro Series take advanced users on a deep dive into Final Cut Pro X and Logic Pro X with sessions on color correction and grading to post production, or audio mixing to editing for emotion, and more.   Perspectives and Performances, offered at select stores, feature influential artists and musicians talking about their creative process or sharing their talents live.   To deliver the new programs, each store will receive new Forum Displays, mobile screens created by Apple's design team specifically for Today at Apple sessions, and updated seating and sound, along with wall displays to showcase the products that help customers get the most out of their Apple products.   "Today at Apple" will launch worldwide in May, with sessions in every store.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

When Apple revealed it would be releasing a new 9.7in tablet in March last year, it was generally expected that we'd get a glimpse at the new iPad Air 3. Instead Apple revealed the 9.7in iPad Pro, and since then the future of the iPad Air 3 has been in serious doubt. With the launch of Apple's latest tablet (simply called 'the iPad'), it's safe to say Apple has killed off the iPad Air range altogether. On first glance, Apple appears to have made some odd choices with its newest device. What we have now is a hybrid of the original iPad Air and Air 2 that is both thicker and heavier than the previous models, with a screen that isn't as fancy. In other words, it should have been a disaster. See related  Best iPad apps for 2017 Apple iPad Pro 9.7 review Apple iPad Pro 9.7 vs iPad Air 2 Price and competition However, it seems Apple has attempted to deliver an attractive alternative to the rather pricey iPad Pro 9.7. Instead of packing in more expensive tech and bumping the price up, the new iPad is Apple's cheapest tablet on the market. At £339, it's by no means a budget device, but it's a full £60 cheaper than the iPad Air 2, and even offers twice the storage capacity at 32GB. There is also a 128GB version available for £429, and 32GB and 128GB models that include 4G connectivity, priced at £469 and £559 respectively. Even against competing Android tablets, the new iPad's price holds up well. The recently released Samsung Galaxy Tab S3, which is gloriously slim and slight and has a fantastic AMOLED display, is rather pricey at £599. Even the equally fantastic Tab S2 has held its price well at £329. Features and design The design of the iPad range never seems to change much with each iteration, and this time is no different. The visual appearance of the new device is no different to any of its predecessors, but Apple's nailed one of the most popular designs ever - and if it ain't broke, don't fix it. You will find the, home button, headphone jack, and lightning connector in all the usual places, and it even features the same 720p 1.2MP front facing camera found on the iPad Air 2. Once again Apple has chosen to encase it in aluminium, and offers the same colour variations as the iPad Pro 9.7: gold, silver, and 'space grey'. Instead of the 'smart' keyboard connector featured on the left edge of the iPad Pro range, the new iPad uses a series of magnets that allow you to quickly attach an iPad folding case or a compatible type covers, although the latter relies on bluetooth. There's no official Apple keyboard cover, either. The only tangible change over its predecessors is the added weight and size of the newer model, at 7.5mm and 478g over the iPad Air 2's 6.1mm and 437g dimensions. However, this is so slight you're unlikely to notice unless you're comparing them side-by-side. Display Sadly, the new iPad's display doesn't quite reach the standards of the iPad Air 2 or the iPad Pro 9.7. The anti-reflective coating found on older devices is missing, and there is a visible gap between the LCD panel and the surface glass, whereas this has traditionally been laminated. Screen vibrancy suffers as a result, and the presence of screen reflections and a poor contrast make on-screen images less impactful. There are some redeeming features however; the 4:3 Retina-class 2,048 x 1,536, 264ppi display has a very impressive maximum brightness that caps out at 520cd/m2, compared to 390cd/m2 for the iPad Air 2. Although the contrast ratio is a fairly disappointing 861:1, which is almost identical to the original iPad Air, Apple has been able to cover more of the sRGB colour gamut, providing colours that are well balanced and highly accurate. Apple has also included its Night Shift tech, which helps to reduce the amount of blue light generated by the screen. Unfortunately the iPad lacks the 'True Tone' feature found on the iPad Pro 9.7, which helps the screen adapt colour temperatures to match ambient conditions. Performance and battery life In terms of hardware, the big change is the move to an Apple A9 processor, the same used in the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus. While on paper it's not as powerful as the A8X processor found in the iPad Air 2, it's superior to the original iPad Air's 1.3GHz A7 chip. Despite the apparent downgrade, the new iPad feels surprisingly nippy. Pinch-zoom and swipe gestures respond perfectly, and there is very little slowdown when running demanding apps. Surprisingly, the new iPad also outperformed both the iPad Air and Air 2 in benchmark tests. It scored higher than both devices in the Geekbench 4 CPU test, reaching 2490 using single-core, over scores of 1803 from the iPad Air 2 and 1321 from the iPad Air. It's also massively more power efficient than previous generations. During our video-playback test, with the screen brightness calibrated to 170cd/m2, the iPad lasted 14 hours 47 minutes in one charge. That's four hours longer than the iPad Air 2, and two hours longer than the iPad Air. Verdict Apple's move to rein in the price of the lower-end iPad is a very savvy one. The iOS software is far better suited to devices of this kind than Android, and offering a more powerful, longer-lasting and more competitively-priced replacement to the previous iPad generation will doubtless help secure the company's place at the top of the pile. Of course, there's a bittersweet element to all this, as it's pretty much the final nail in the coffin for anyone who was hoping to see an iPad Air 3. If you can get over your disappointment, however, you'll find that Apple has produced one of the best tablets on the market once again. If you can't quite stomach the price of an iPad Pro, this is the tablet to buy.

A new report has revealed Jeff Norris, a specialist in the new technology from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), has been employed at the firm since earlier this year, according to a report from Bloomberg. Sources revealed that Norris has been working as a senior manager of the AR team - a department said to be developing prototype glasses that can project AR visuals. Scroll down for video  A new report has revealed Jeff Norris (pictured) , a specialist in the new technology from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), has recently joined the tech giant’s team earlier this year PREDICTIONS FOR APPLE GLASSES  Apple looks like it may be moving into the world of augmented reality by considering expanding into wearable glass headsets.  Robert Scoble, a technology blogger, expects a very lightweight pair of glasses, with the electronics on other places on your body, such as in an iPhone or other wearable.  The wearable headset would connect wirelessly to iPhones and show information that is superimposed onto a user's view of the real world. Norris led mission operations innovations for the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory and creates human interfaces that are helping develop more controlled robots and spacecraft. And three years ago, he ‘started a multi-project initiative applying virtual and augmented reality to space exploration’, which could have been what caught Apple’s eye. Sources told Bloomberg that Norris has been working with the firm’s augmented reality team that is run by former Dolby Labs executive Mike Rockwell. And Rockwell’s team is also believed to be developing a pair of AR glasses and other features in the space for future versions of the iPhone – other sources revealed to Bloomberg in March. While working at NASA, Norris was involved in numerous projects that focused around AR and virtual reality (VR).

However, documents that surfaced last week do add more evidence that the Cupertino company is busy developing a pair of glasses. Health and safety document had revealed how several employees suffered from eye pain after trying out a mystery 'new prototype'. The report added the eye complaints were 'thought to be associated with use', sparking speculation that Apple could be developing a line of iGlasses.  The report, which lists all the injuries incurred by Apple employees in February of this year, was mistakenly sent round to hundreds of workers. AR IN THE IPHONE 8?    rumor regarding the iPhone 8 suggests it will have a front-facing camera and infrared module that senses 3D space.  The sensors in the phone are said to detect the location and depth of objects around it.  The complete 3D system would send invisible IR light signals out from the phone and then wait for them to hit objects and return using the 1.4 megapixel IR receiver.  The camera would be used for a range of applications including facial recognition, iris scanning and overall improved selfies.  It could also place the user’s face on a computer animated character – the front facing camera and 3D sensor would let iOS owners use their selfies for augmented reality. An Apple insider leaked the report and speculated that its contents hint at the secret development of VR glasses, according to Gizmodo. One incident involving a mystery gadget at Apple's De Anza office in Cupertino led to 'medical treatment beyond first aid'. The report said: 'After BT4 user study, user advised study lead, that she experienced discomfort in her eye and said she was able to see the laser flash at several points during the study. 'Study lead referred her to optometrist and secured prototype unit for analysis.' During another incident, an employee from Apple's Vallco Parkway office reported eye pain after trying a 'new prototype'. 'Employee reported eye pain after working with new prototype, thought it may be associated with use,' the report said. 'He noticed that the security seal on the magenta (outer) case had been broken and had thought the unit may have been tampered with.' These mysterious incidents have led many to speculate that Apple is testing a pair of augmented reality glasses.   Read more: Apple Hires NASA AR Guru to Help Run Its Own Efforts - Bloomberg deadspin-quote-carrot-aligned-w-bgr-2 Share or comment on this article e-mail 8 shares Most watched News videos Animal lover smashes car window to free a dog dying in the heat Ex-con fashion model Jeremy Meeks gets denied entry to the UK Schoolboy, 14, fends off angry adult using martial arts Unflinching female tram driver smashes into car on the track Former Southampton striker James Beattie rescues children on yacht Aston Villa fans bully and taunt a couple on train Ian Huntley's daughter Sam says he doesn't deserve to be called dad Shocking video shows drug addict writhing around on street Shocking moment over 60 teenage girls brawl in Florida mall Arkansas executes Jack Jones and Marcel Williams on the same day Dramatic moment speed boat crashes into rocks and flips over Dog has to be rescued after getting head stuck in jar KATIE HOPKINS Kim’s ass hasn’t just broken the internet,...

Apple will start mass production of the hotly-anticipated iPhone 8 later than expected, causing massive supply issues that will stretch into 2018. A couple of months after it was reported Apple would step up manufacturing earlier than normal, it appears the company has been unable to finalise the next iPhone's design in time. The completely revised device will usher in a new era of Apple handsets, featuring edge-to-edge glass and a fingerprint sensor built into the display. Getting the new hardware ready for launch is reportedly proving problematical. A research note passed to MacRumors by respected Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo claims Apple won't be ready to start mass production of the iPhone 8 until October or November. This has been corroborated by multiple other sources. Apple usually ramps up manufacturing during August or September, ensuring it has enough devices available on day one to supply the majority of customers. Faced with a two month delay in large-scale production, Apple could now miss its September iPhone unveil for the first time in years. The launch will come closer to the holiday season, worsening the supply issues. Kuo expects the delay itself won't harm the iPhone's sales. Most buyers will be happy to wait another couple of months to purchase the new phone. With the supply problems likely to persist right up until the holiday season, customers could end up waiting until early 2018 to actually receive their device though. Even if the iPhone 8 is delayed, Apple is likely to still launch the iPhone 7s-series in early September, as originally planned. These models will be incremental upgrades over the iPhone 7 for customers who don't want to pay the premium for the iPhone 8. The company could also unveil the next-generation device during the event but it would leave customers waiting months for their handset to ship. The manufacturing complexities of the new phone go beyond the glass and metal design. It's also the first iPhone to use a 10-nanometer processor, considerably improving performance and power efficiency. Apple is also upgrading the circuit board itself to be based on a new substrate, leading to substantial internal changes that the company evidently needs time to finalise. Stock issues on new Apple products aren't uncommon. Several of the firm's most popular devices from the past few years suffered from similar supply constraints during their first few months of availability. Most recently, Apple's wireless AirPods were in short supply until early this year after facing a delayed launch. With many fans already preparing to make iPhone 8 purchases, Apple will need to get its supply chain moving quickly to keep its iPhone shipment figures high. Kuo noted the delay could reduce overall sales this year as people are left waiting longer to purchase their next handset. This will cap the total number of shipments in 2017 but could increase momentum for next year.

Powermat CEO Elad Dubzinski called wireless charging ‘a standard feature in the next iPhone’ ahead of any official iPhone 7s or iPhone 8 announcement. Sony A6500 Powermat’s CEO made the comment in an unrelated news release about the company gaining a new board chairman: “With the recent announcement by Apple that wireless charging will become a standard feature in the next iPhone, we are finally at the threshold of mainstream adoption,” said Mr. Dubzinski. As CEO of a major company involved in the wireless charging space, Dubzinski may be in a position to know something about these details ahead of time, right? Maybe, but that’s likely not the case here. The Powermat CEO refers to a ‘recent announcement by Apple’ on wireless charging being standard in new iPhones, but that hasn’t publicly happened yet. Dubzinski is likely referring to Apple’s recent entry into the Wireless Power Consortium. That move certainly fueled rumors that the iPhone 8 will include wireless charging, but Powermat followed the announcement with one of its own that said the company would support ‘whatever wireless charging protocol’ Apple uses. That doesn’t sound like Powermat knows how Apple will approach wireless charging exactly. At any rate, wireless charging has been expected for at least one of Apple’s new iPhone models later this year, namely the flagship iPhone 8 which is expected to feature a major bezel-less redesign. A report last fall predicted that Apple may not bundle the wireless charger in the box, however, despite shipping support for the feature. The same analyst from KGI Securities more recently predicted that both the iterative iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus models and the so-called iPhone 8 will feature wireless charging support. Separately, an analyst at JPMorgan has claimed Apple is working with Broadcom on wireless charging support for new iPhones. In that research note, however, it was qualified that the feature may not ship until next year however.

Apps iOS Apps Mac Apps Accessories Tips Jailbreaking Jailbreak Tweaks How to Jailbreak Unlock Devices iPhone iPad Mac Apple Watch Apple TV Deals Latest Deals Dutch court rules Apple cannot replace broken iOS gadgets with refurbished or remanufactured ones Christian Zibreg on April 25, 2017 11 A judge in the Subdistrict Court of Amsterdam has ruled that Apple cannot replace broken iPhone, iPad or iPod touch devices with refurbished or remanufactured units, Dutch outlet Tweakers reported Tuesday. That ruling arrived after a similar decision in December 2016 forced the Cupertino giant to replace a Danish man’s broken iPhone with a new unit rather than a refurbished model that he was entitled to in accordance with local law. The case in question involves a woman who bought an iPad Air 2 with the extended AppleCare warranty protection add-on back in 2015. The tablet started exhibiting Wi-Fi issues so she took it to Apple and received a remanufactured iPad as a replacement. As it turns out, the woman disliked the remanufactured unit but Apple refused to issue her a brand new iPad so she went ahead and filed a legal complaint. The judge ordered that the company supply the plaintiff with an entirely new iPad unit. “If the consumer purchased a new iPad, she is entitled to a new iPad as a replacement,” reads the ruling. The court also fined Apple €100 (about $110) for each day that the woman was left without her iPad replacement. The ruling mandates that all broken iOS devices sold in the Netherlands be replaced with brand new units rather than their refurbished or remanufactured counterparts. Apple on its part attempted to argue that remanufactured units should be excluded from the ruling because they’re distinct from refurbished ones, but the judge was unimpressed. Refurbished devices are used items that have been returned to Apple. Both refurbished and remanufactured units may include used parts from broken models. But unlike refurbished models that are sold at up to a 15 percent discount, remanufactured units are unavailable for sale and are only being used as warranty replacements. The ruling does not prevent the iPhone maker to replace a refurbished iOS device with another refurbished unit. Apple says that refurbished units conform to the same manufacturing and inspection standards as its brand new devices. “We test and certify all Apple refurbished products and include a one-year warranty,“ reads the refurbished section of Apple’s online store. Source: Tweakers (Google Translate) Tagged: Apple iPad Lawsuit Legal Netherlands News Refurbished MORE FROM iDB Dutch court rules against replacing a user’s defective iPhone 6s with a refurbished unit Lawsuit says Apple broke FaceTime on iOS 6 to force iOS 7 upgrades & save money on data fees Apple must replace a Danish man’s iPhone with a new unit rather than a refurbished model Alex Wilson Well the people in the Netherlands are now going to pay more for their iOS devices plain and simple. An Apple actuary will run the numbers and every iOS device will go up a bit more so they can get “new” devices. I’d rather see Apple clearly state you will get a refurb unit or you can pay to exchange to a new unit. Ds You already do pay for a refurb unit if you have Apple Care anyways. Case in point. I had to replace my iPad Pro because I dropped my iPhone of it cause I was using it as a flash light so that I could see better when I was putting on the screen protector on the iPad.. I know ironic right? but it still cost me $55 for the refurb iPad Pro. Alex Wilson Agreed, but now they will pay even more for a new unit or the warranty itself will change. burge You purchased a new device you should get a new device in any replacement/insurance program. It should be new for new and not new for here we fixed this it’s good as new but it’s not new but it’s close enough so it will do, Charlie It’s just not transparent about what was actually new and what wasn’t in those devices, otherwise I am sure many people wouldn’t mind it. Mr_Coldharbour And that’s how it should be. If I’m still within my warranty and my phone breaks, I expect a brand new unit not a refurbished one. When I purchased the original unit, it was brand new. This is what I appreciate about EU countries, they fight for the rights of their citizens and make sure conglomerates don’t take them for a ride, and win. Jake1047s so when you drive a car off of a lot and it has an issue they should buy you a new one if yours needs to be replaced? Even if you did use it for a period of time? People today….. Cazz If she brought it in for WiFi issues and it was still under the AppleCare, That replacement would’ve been free. I think the fact that whatever discussion happened during the Unveiling of the “remanufactured” iPad she was unhappy with and fought for a “new” iPad right then and there. Eventhough they’re technically the same thing minus the wrapper and box with goodies. When I worked for apple, this happened many times… Customer hates hearing the word “Used”. If you word everything correctly, Scenarios can be avoided, but not all. Jose Rivera See, if I was to work for Apple and they ask, “Are these new phones?” I would be like, “Yeah. These are soeacial replacement units that we have in stock for occasions like this. This is why they come in a box without anything and it’s just the phone. Those are the warranty replacement phones. They’re all brand new and haven’t been used apart from being tested at the factory to make sure everything’s good to go like all the other phones we sell with an accessory box and such.” burge And I’m sure Apple wouldn’t back you up if the customer found out you lied to them. Gary LE I had the air 1 replaced with the refurbished/remanufactured on inside a brown box and the genius said “here is a new replacement!” I knew that ot wasnt new because I can see a very small hairline scratch at an angle! But to me Apple has been very generous in replacements alot more than other companies!

Reputed analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicts that Apple will begin mass production on the device in October/November. While there have been iPhone shortages in the past, this timeline suggests that people won’t be able to buy the iPhone 8 until early 2018. This is a pretty severe delay, especially if Apple sticks to tradition and announces its smartphones in September. This year isn’t expected to be any different, with many asserting that the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus will be launched alongside the OLED iPhone. Kuo thinks the delay in the iPhone 8’s availability will hurt Apple’s 2017 sales since consumers will opt to wait for the handset. Furthermore, he has a pessimistic outlook on the iPhone 7s models since bezel-less handsets from Android manufacturers like Samsung will make the entry-level iPhones less appealing. Also See: iPhone 8 dummy model gets spotted in the wild The iPhone 8 has apparently become the victim of significant hardware upgrades. Components like a new 3D Touch module, custom OLED display, custom A11 10nm processor, and 3D sensing cameras are supposedly causing the delay. Interestingly, a separate Chinese leak has purportedly gotten its hands on the internal schematics of the device, confirming most of the aforementioned parts. The front of the alleged iPhone 8 features all-new 3D camera sensors, infrared sensors, a facial recognition camera, and a True Tone flash unit. The bottom makes room for dual speakers, a change from the single + dummy speaker setup Apple placed in the iPhone 7. There appears to be two batteries (yellow + orange) inside and a stacked mainboard design to make room for them. There’s no sign of the home button in the blueprint. A wireless charging module (pink) and fingerprint sensor (purple) can also be seen. The position of the latter hints that Apple might be going ahead with an in-display Touch ID solution, rather than the rear-facing placement suggested by another leak.

Norris, who worked at JPL since 1999, founded the JPL Ops Lab, NASA's premier facility for development of human-system interfaces for mission operations, according to his website. He was also “Principal Computer Scientist and lead of multiple projects focused on human system interaction with a recent emphasis on virtual and augmented reality.” Norris also worked on NASA projects, including providing headsets to scientists on the ground so they could experience live views on Mars and provided Microsoft Hololens headsets to astronauts onboard the International Space Station. Apple AR Glasses Rumors Apple has been recently dropping clues on its AR projects. Besides the hiring of Norris earlier this year, Apple reportedly teamed up with German optics company Carl Zeiss to work on a pair of AR smart glasses which could be announced as soon as this year, popular blogger Robert Scoble revealed in January.

Chris Burns - Apr 25, 2017 1 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Apple’s newest plan to reinvigorate their customer community is a program called “Today at Apple”. It’s not a software program, but a sort of “modern-day down square” held at Apple Stores. In an expansion of the already-active events that take place on a smaller scale, Teaching sessions, interactive experiences, and demonstrations are set to be held at every single Apple Store in the world, starting in May of 2017. Apple announced plans for Today at Apple in collaboration with “world-class artists, photographers, and musicians.” In “select cities” there’ll be “world-class” teachers, while every single one of Apple’s 495 official Apple Stores will have (at least) a set of “highly-trained team members” leading sessions. These sessions will be varied in major ways from one another. Apple suggested today that their sessions would include everything from professional-level programs down to simple how-to lessons. This is not the first time such presentations have been made, of course – many Apple stores have had classes and small talk sessions in the past. This is the first time Apple’s been set to make such a big push for sessions like these at Apple Stores worldwide, all at once. Which Teachers? Apple suggested today that sessions in Today at Apple would be taught by a wide variety of experts. “Many sessions will be taught by new Creative Pros, the liberal arts equivalent of Apple’s technical Geniuses,” said an Apple representative. “Each Creative Pro is an expert in one or more areas of the arts, highly trained to pass along their knowledge to Apple users of all levels.” Creative professionals included in the preview photos above and below include artist Adrian Johnson, designer and artist Jessica Hische, and hip-hop producer RZA. These more well-known artists and creative professionals will appear in select cities – the RZA, for example, here is teaching an “Art of Beatmaking” session at an Apple Store in Brooklyn. What Sessions? Apple users will be able to attend each of the following sorts of sessions in addition to unique offerings through Today at Apple: • Perspectives and Performances: influential artists and musicians • Pro Series: Final Cut Pro X and Logic Pro X • Photo Labs: New techniques, hands-on sessions • Music Labs: New tools, genres, and beats • Photo Walks: Similar to/part of Photo Labs, framing architecture, capturing action on video, other subject matter • Sketch Walks: iPad Pro, observational drawings, techniques • Coding sessions: Swift Playgrounds, coding concepts • Kids Hour: coding with Sphero, Music with Garage Band, Making Movies Together with iMovie. Wrap-up and Timing The Today at Apple program will launch starting in May of 2017. To see which programs will be launching at our local store, we’ll check in on store-specific Forum Displays.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: Armando Ferreira, YouTube Crazy deal gets you an unlocked iPhone 7 Plus for less than an iPhone 7 Maren Estrada April 25th, 2017 at 12:11 PM Share Tweet No iPhone in history has ever been as expensive as Apple’s iPhone 7 Plus. Of course, that sort of makes sense since no iPhone in history has ever been as impressive or capable as Apple’s iPhone 7 Plus. It has the fastest performance out there, the best camera out there, and battery life that outshines every other smartphone on the market. All that comes at a substantial price, of course, which is why it’s so important to take advantage when rare iPhone 7 Plus sales come around. Well, it just so happens that one of those sales just came around. eBay is currently selling refurbished 32GB iPhone 7 Plus handsets for $80 less than the cost of a new 32GB iPhone 7. Black is the only color left in stock, so definitely jump on this deal as quickly as you can. Of note, the seller has 98% positive feedback with more than 37,000 buyer ratings, so it’s save to say they’re trustworthy. A few notes about the refurb process from the product page: An item that has been professionally restored to working order by a Carrier-approved vendor. This means the product has been inspected, cleaned, and repaired to meet manufacturer specifications. Device will show signs of wear like scratches, scuffs, and minor dents. This item will not be in the original packaging and includes an MFi-certified lightning cable and UL-listed charger.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: iDropNews Report may shed new light on Apple’s iPhone 8 design Chris Smith @chris_writes April 25th, 2017 at 11:46 AM Share Tweet According to a number of more recent reports, the iPhone 8 won’t have a curved screen like the Galaxy S8’s dual edge Infinity Display, as was initially rumored. Now, a new story out of Korea explains the reason why Apple chose to use flat OLED screens inside the iPhone 8 rather than going for a curved design. Apparently, it’s all related to one particular technology. Don't Miss: Nintendo Switch will be back in stock on Amazon as soon as next week Samsung, LG, and Apple are currently working on display lamination processes that would meet Apple’s needs. According to ETNews, Apple may be interested in making iPhones with four curved edges that include curved corners. Current lamination technology would prevent the corners of such a smartphone from supporting touch actions, which is apparently why Apple is sticking with a flat OLED display this year. The report notes that Samsung and LG are looking to fix the problem and come up with solutions that are satisfactory to Apple, even if that means having to deal with low yields initially. A smartphone with four curved edges would offer users an even better screen-to-body ratio, allowing manufacturers to further shrink top and bottom bezels. Apple patents have even revealed wraparound displays for the iPhone, as well as methods of incorporating all front-facing features of a phone into the screen, including buttons. This would explain Apple’s specific needs for curved displays. ETNews isn’t the only news outlet reporting on smartphone screens with curved edges and curved corners. While the Korean report focuses on lamination tech that would make possible such screens, Bloomberg said a few days ago in an iPhone 8 report that Apple tested an ambitious design for its top 2017 iPhones. “Apple also tested a more ambitious prototype with the same slightly curved front and steel frame, but a glass back with more dramatic curves on the top and bottom like the original iPhone design from 2007, one of the people said,” the report noted, adding that suppliers have struggled to “reliably produce heavily curved glass in mass quantities.” That’s probably why the iPhone 8 will stick with a flat OLED display design this year that will be covered with slightly curved 2.5D glass, just like the iPhone 7.

The company is also announcing new educational sessions that will launch next month in all its stores, called Today at Apple. The updates are the work of a team led by Apple’s highest-ranking female executive, Angela Ahrendts. Ahrendts became Apple’s senior vice president of retail in 2014 after working as CEO of Burberry. She has overseen the stores’ most significant redesign since they opened around 15 years ago. Apple’s Genius Grove CBS News “I was thinking about this ‘cause this is the first big redesign in 15 years. And it was Steve Jobs and Ron Johnson who did the first design of the Apple stores. Did that weigh on you? Oh my gosh? Following in Steve Jobs’ footsteps here?” Norah O’Donnell asked.    “You know, I think that anything you do at Apple… you feel a tremendous onus,” Ahrendts said in a rare television interview with “CBS This Morning.” “You want to carry on the legacy of what it meant… the main objective – our soul is our people. And our job is to enrich their lives, change the world. And so I think that’s the bigger pressure you put on yourself.”    It was in 2001 that the world got its first look inside an Apple store, but now the look and the feel of the stores are changing, thanks to the 56-year-old. Play Video CBS This Morning Apple exec Angela Ahrendts on getting back to human connections In a rare television interview with Norah O'Donnell, Angela Ahrendts, Apple's senior vice president of retail, explains what she meant in her TED... “Probably the simplest way to describe it – because everything at Apple has to be simple. The way that – that we kinda talk about it inside… we say, ‘This is the largest product that Apple produces,’” Ahrendts said. “So if you think of it, the hardware, which is the architecture of the store. The software is what happens in the store and how we basically turn on Apple music and the app store. … So we started with the hardware.”   In 100 of its biggest stores, like the San Francisco flagship, Apple’s “hardware” update means new screens and spaces for meetings and classes. The Genius Bar, now lined with trees, becomes the Genius Grove. And there’s a more dimensional take on the Genius: new staffers specialized in music and photography called “Creative Pros.”  Play Video CBS This Morning Angela Ahrendts on executive pay, women at Apple In a conversation with Norah O'Donnell, Angela Ahrendts, Apple's senior vice president of retail, opens up about executive pay for females and wh... “Is the idea that the store will have all of these listed classes, teachers, experiences that will be publicly posted that will draw more and more people in?” O’Donnell asked.  “Absolutely,” Ahrendts said. “So we call the software of the store that we are launching the end of May – we call that Today at Apple.” That “software” will roll out across Apple’s nearly 500 stores, many of which will be changed literally overnight. Ahrendts calls it all an effort to create “town squares” where customers engage with their devices and their communities.

Amazon’s investing in stores. Google’s investing in stores. ... Starbucks figured it out, you know? Being a gathering place for – right? ‘Meet me at Starbucks,”’ Ahrendts said. “And you know, I’ve told the teams, ‘I’ll know we’ve done a really, really great job if the next generation, if Gen Z says, “Meet me at Apple. Did you see what’s going on at Apple today?”’” “Does that apply to Android and Samsung users too?” O’Donnell asked.    “Absolutely. Absolutely. And we have an incredible trade up program that—” she said, laughing. Ahrendts shows O’Donnell the new designs CBS News   Apple isn’t exactly strapped for cash, having set a revenue record of almost $80 billion this fiscal year. But Ahrendts insists the in-store experience isn’t cheapened just because there are products for sale.   “This is a little bit of a harder question. But I know you’ve thought so much about this. Can you foster a sense of community at the same time having a commercial objective?” O’Donnell asked.   “Yeah. I’ve thought a lot about it. And – and I would argue it’s kind of what Apple’s always done anyway,” Ahrendts said. “I think we’ve always been this energy hub if you will. We’re just empowering the teams to take it so much further.” Play Video CBS This Morning Apple exec Angela Ahrendts on "responsibility" of big companies In a conversation with Norah O'Donnell, Angela Ahrendts, Apple's senior vice president of retail, discusses her goals beyond the business side of... After a dip in sales of iPhones and Mac computers in 2016, some people have speculated that Apple is at the end of its product line and the store redesign is just window dressing. “How do you respond to that?” O’Donnell asked.    “Yeah. I respond, they probably don’t really know the company that well. It’s, you know, each of the businesses that Apple has are so big,” Ahrendts said. “Tim [Cook] talks a lot during the earnings calls on the service business and how rapidly that’s growing and … that’s the part really we had never been able to unlock in retail before.”    It was at Burberry that Ahrendts first merged retail with online shopping, tripling company stock and prompting Tim Cook to call London from Cupertino.   “I told Tim this as we were interviewing. I said, ‘I am not a techie. Like, wrong person.’ You know? And he, you know, very politely said, ‘I think we have a lot of those,’” Ahrendts said. Play Video CBS This Morning Apple exec Angela Ahrendts on collaborating with designer Jony Ive In a conversation with Norah O'Donnell, Angela Ahrendts, Apple's senior vice president of retail, discusses the vision of industrial designer Jon... “So why did he want you if you’re not techie?” O’Donnell asked.   “I think what it came down to honestly because the teams are so big and so global – I think that a lot of it had to do with leadership,” Ahrendts said.   “I read that… part of the reason that he hired you was because of your ability to motivate people,” O’Donnell said. “How do you motivate people?”    “You don’t overthink it, right? Do unto others. I mean, you connect with them and you care and you – and you do what you say you’re going to do. I mean, it’s not rocket science,” Ahrendts said. Ahrendts said it’s her Midwestern upbringing, as one of six children raised in New Palestine, Indiana, that keeps her humble, even as she’s become one of the highest-paid executives at Apple – and in the country. “Steve Jobs was famously empathetic,” O’Donnell said. “I’ve heard you say, ‘Empathy is one of the greatest creators of energy.’ What role has it played in your success?”   “I mean, again, I think huge,” Ahrendts said. “My dad used to always say, ‘I can teach you anything. But I can’t teach you to feel. I can’t teach you to care.’ And… I think when you’re empathetic, you’re putting yourself in somebody else’s shoes, right? It’s not about you. … There’s seven billion people on the planet. It’s not about you. … I think that when you’re empathetic to someone, they open up to you, right? They don’t get defensive. And when they open up, you’re both open and then you can dream and you can, you know, come up with incredible things together and –”    “It unlocks a lot of things?” O’Donnell asked.    “Uh-huh,” Ahrendts said.   © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

Josh Smith04/25/2017 This is what the new iPhone 8 may look like. A new set of photos shows a dummy unit, or mock-up, of the iPhone 8 with a new all glass front design, metal edges, new camera placement and no visible home button. The treasure trove of photos came just as multiple reports suggest Apple will need to delay from the traditional iPhone 8 release date to deliver the new iPhone to consumers. This is in addition to a potentially higher iPhone 8 price. After years of similar designs, growing pains may keep this from arriving just in time for the moment that users can upgrade with the Annual iPhone Upgrade plan that Apple offers. Is this the iPhone 8? If this is the iPhone 8, will you wait to buy it? Above you see multiple angles of what could be an all new iPhone 8. The leak from @VenyaGeskin1 appears on 9to5Mac and it includes what looks like a CNC sample for a new iPhone. While we cannot verify that this is the actual iPhone 8, we’ve seen the same kind of photos reveal the actual look of the iPhone months ahead of Apple’s reveal. In 2012 we shared an iPhone 5 engineering sample made of similar materials that a case manufacturer used to test the fit of early iPhone case prototypes. There is a good chance that this is something along those lines and not an actual iPhone 8 mock-up from Apple. That doesn’t mean you can dismiss it. Our iPhone 5 engineering sample showed off the new iPhone 5 design months ahead of Apple and even with tighter security leaks like this are possible. While the photos don’t include any way to show this, the iPhone 8 will include a front virtual home button integrated into the screen that includes Touch ID, according to their source. Will You Wait for a Later iPhone 8 Release Date? We expected to see the iPhone 8 release date arrive in September, which is when the iPhone typically lands on store shelves. It’s something of a routine at this point and even though nothing is confirmed, consumers expect to see a new iPhone in September. Ming-Chi Kou, who shares many accurate iPhone and Apple leaks, says that mass production of the iPhone 8 is pushed to October and November. Kou cites supply issues with the parts needed for massive upgrades to the iPhone for the delay. Even though the iPhone 8 release date may end up later, Kou says the iPhone 7s release date should arrive on schedule. Nikkei also weighs in stating that the iPhone 8 release date may come one to two months later than traditional iPhone releases due to components. “There might be a one to two month delay in Samsung’s production of OLED panels for Apple,” Brian Huh, an analyst at research company IHS Markit told Nikkei, adding “Samsung originally plans to begin churning out OLED panels in May but now the schedule will likely be pushed back to the end of June or sometime in July” Given the rumored amount of change from the iPhone 7 to the iPhone 8, will you wait for the iPhone 8 or buy an iPhone 7s as soon as it is available? Take Our Poll 8 iPhone 8 Features We Want in 2017 New iPhone 8 Design to Enable Features   1 / 8 Everyone wants a new iPhone 8 design, but most people don't know what changes they actually want. We're leading off our iPhone 8 feature wishlist with a new iPhone 8 design because it is a key part of enabling new iPhone 8 features. After sticking with a very similar design for three years there is an expectation of major changes for the 2017 iPhone and here are the things we would love to see Apple do with a new design. Shrink the overall size of the iPhone 8 Plus without lowering the screen size. Apple could do this by shrinking the bezels on the sides and bottom of the iPhone some to offer a smaller overall package. Apple could choose to change where you use Touch ID and how the home button works in new ways to make this happen. We definitely don't want a phone that is slim just to be slim, especially not at the price of battery life, but there is something to be said about an iPhone 8 design that trims some fat. The Jet Black iPhone 7 feels different than all the other colors. While it is more susceptible to scratches it is easier to grip, which is something we can definitely see Apple add to the new iPhone 8. KGI Securities Analyst Ming-Chi Kou predicts the iPhone 8 design will look include an all glass front and back with stainless steel metal on the edges of premium models. This could come together for an iPhone 8 design that looks like a cross between the iPhone 4s and the Jet Black iPhone 7.   1 / 8 One Response 04/25/2017 MiniMage Reply You’re missing a voting option.

"Where would Apple be, where would Cisco be, where would IBM be if they were not sourcing the best products and talent from across the world," Patel asked here on Monday, and added a warning: "If policies come in the way of that, then the big wealth creators in a country that advocates protectionism are ultimately affected." Last year Apple applied for 1,354 H1-B visas, Cisco for 517, and IBM for 2,233 to bring in talent for their operations, according to a database maintained by Immihelp. (IBM applied for 13,115 H1-B visas in 2015.) H1-B visas are a scarce commodity in the tech world where companies vie for annual quota of the 85,000 visas meant for highly-skilled professionals. Although Patel did not mention Google or Microsoft, both companies are headed by immigrants from India. The triumvirate at the top of the market capitalisation roster, Apple, Google and Microsoft, all have immigrant origins or connections. Sundar Pichai is the CEO of Google, which was co-founded by Sergey Brin who immigrated from the former Soviet Union. The biological father of Apple's founder, Steve Jobs, is a Syrian immigrant, Abdulfattah Jandali. "The most efficient corporations in the world, including in the US, benefit, their share prices are where they are because of the global supply chain," Patel said. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella's performance underscores his observation about market performance. Microsoft's share prices that were lagging around the $36 range when he took over in February 2014 closed on Monday at $67.53. Donald Trump, who ran for President on a platforms of "Buy American, Hire American", has called for restricting the H1-B visas for professionals to higher-level technical positions paying higher wages and for bringing back manufacturing to the US. While answering audience questions after delivering the annual Kotak Family Distinguished Lecture at Columbia University, Patel was skeptical about the efficacy of restricting H1-B visas and imports to solve the domestic problem of equity. He ascribed the calls for protectionism in the US to income inequality, and said they "should be addressed through domestic fiscal policies, in other words, taxation and income transfers". "Using trade instruments like customs duty, border tax, etc. is not the most efficient way. In fact, it could end up somewhere else."

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile New rumor says everything we know about the iPhone 8 release is wrong Image Source: Vianney le Masne Zach Epstein @zacharye April 25th, 2017 at 10:31 AM Share Tweet According to nearly a dozen independent reports at this point, Apple has big plans for the late summer and early fall. It is widely believed that the company is preparing to release not one, not two, but three new iPhone models between mid-September and November, depending on whether or not the star of the show — the iPhone 8 — is delayed. Aside from Apple’s completely redesigned iPhone 8, the company is believed to be prepping updated iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus models with next-gen specs and maybe even new glass backs to facilitate wireless charging. Apple fans are indeed expected to have more options than ever this year, with three unique models to choose from. But now, however, a new rumor suggests that nearly everything we thought we knew about this year’s iPhone release is wrong. Don't Miss: New renders finally show the iPhone 8 design we want We have seen one or two correct rumors originate on Chinese tech blog MicGadget, but this is almost certainly not one of them. According to a new report from the blog that was published on Tuesday morning, Apple has no plans to update its iPhone 7 line, and will instead skip past the 7s and 7s Plus, moving straight to the iPhone 8 series. As opposed to releasing two iPhone 7s models and an iPhone 8 (or iPhone Edition, or iPhone Pro, or whatever Apple intends to call it), MicGadget says Apple will only release two new models this year, an iPhone 8 and an iPhone 8 Plus. Unlikely though it may be, the blog says it learned of Apple’s plans from multiple sources inside the company’s manufacturing partner, Foxconn. “Some our friends from Foxconn confirmed that Foxconn received an order for two new models,” the report reads. “[It means] that Apple will be released two, not three models.” The blog goes on to say that both new iPhone 8 models will feature similar designs with a dual-lens rear camera setup. We’re fairly certain that this report is way off base. But as we said earlier, the source in this case has been correct once or twice in the past, so it’s at least worth noting.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq rose as much as 0.65 percent to hit a record level of 6,022.65, powered by gains in index heavyweights Apple and Microsoft. The index had breached the 5,000 mark on March 7, 2000 and closed above that level two days later during the height of the tech boom. Tuesday's gains build on a day-earlier rally, which was driven by the victory of centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron in the first round of the French presidential election. Polls show Macron is likely to beat his far-right rival Marine Le Pen in a deciding vote on May 7. "Political headlines in Europe don't tend to stick, but create buying opportunities more than having long-term consequences," said Stephen Wood, chief market strategist at Russell Investments. Investors are keeping a close watch on the latest earnings season, hoping that companies will justify their lofty valuations, spurred in part by President Donald Trump's pro-growth promises. Overall profits of S&P 500 companies are estimated to have risen 11 percent in the first quarter - the most since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Trump, who had promised to make "a big tax reform" announcement on Wednesday, has directed his aides to move quickly on a plan to cut the corporate income tax rate to 15 percent from 35 percent, a Trump administration official said on Monday. At 10:54 a.m. ET (1454 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 222.74 points, or 1.07 percent, at 20,986.63, the S&P 500 was up 12.79 points, or 0.54 percent, at 2,386.94 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 29.65 points, or 0.5 percent, at 6,013.47. Better-than-expected profits at McDonald's and Caterpillar helped the Dow outperform other major Wall Street indexes. Gains on the S&P were broad-based. Ten of its 11 major sectors were higher. DuPont's 3 percent increase, following a profit beat, helped the materials sector notch the most gains. Biogen's shares jumped more than 4 percent after the biotech company reported better-than-expected quarterly profit and revenue on Tuesday. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,990 to 791. On the Nasdaq, 1,939 issues rose and 724 fell. The S&P 500 index showed 77 52-week highs and three lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 164 highs and 26 lows.

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish iPhone 8 Delay Attributed To Display Production Problems By Adnan Farooqui on 04/25/2017 08:09 PDT There have been multiple reports recently which suggest that the iPhone 8 is going to be delayed. The first OLED iPhone from Apple is now expected to arrive at some point next year as opposed to the fall this year. A new report claims that one of the big reasons why Apple won’t be able to come out with the iPhone 8 this year is because of supply issues associated with the flagship’s OLED display panel. A new report claims that the iPhone 8 is going to face supply shortages which will be significantly more than the normal supply constraints that are faced by new flagship smartphones that are in demand. Previous reports suggested that it was the low production yield of the fingerprint sensor that was causing the delay but it’s not believed to be the handset’s OLED display panel. The iPhone 8 is believed to be the first smartphone from Apple to feature an OLED display. Samsung has a virtual monopoly in the small OLED display panel market which is why it’s believed to be the biggest supplier of OLED displays for the next-generation iPhone. The report claims that there might be a delay of up to two months in Samsung’s production of OLED panels for Apple which is going to result in a delayed release. It goes without saying that none of this has been confirmed at this point in time so take it with a grain of salt for now. Filed in Apple >Cellphones. Read more about iphone 8.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars BUSINESS As brick and mortar retail suffers, Apple hopes to boost its 495 stores with new classes Chris O'Brien@obrien April 25, 2017 7:46 AM Physical retail, particularly in the United States, is in crisis, with many big brand names announcing massive layoffs, store closings, and bankruptcies. However, some high-end specialty retailers, such as Apple, have managed to buck that trend with stores that emphasize unique experiences in addition to the opportunity to buy stuff. The company announced today that it now has 495 stores around the world. That includes the latest one in Dubai. And in a continuing effort to find ways to pull people in, the company said today it would launch a new series of events and classes that will be available at every store in some fashion. Dubbed “Today at Apple,” the new events would include a combination of hands-on teaching sessions run by Apple employees and special presentations made by “world-class artists, photographers, and musicians.” “At the heart of every Apple Store is the desire to educate and inspire the communities we serve,” said Angela Ahrendts, Apple’s senior vice president of retail, in a statement. “‘Today at Apple’ is one of the ways we’re evolving our experience to better serve local customers and entrepreneurs. We’re creating a modern-day town square, where everyone is welcome in a space where the best of Apple comes together to connect with one another, discover a new passion, or take their skill to the next level. We think it will be a fun and enlightening experience for everyone who joins.” Of course, many Apple stores already offer various kinds of training sessions and workshops. And those have occasionally included appearances by celebrated creative names. But “Today at Apple” represents an expansion of those efforts. Not only with these classes and events become more widespread and more frequent, but they’ll also include new subjects such as art and design and music in sessions led by professions creatives who work for Apple. Still, it demonstrates that Apple is clearly continuing to invest in its stores and evolve the role they play. In fact, the company is spending billions renovating or replacing many older stores. Since the opening of the first Apple store in 2001, they have offered an opportunity for customers to try new products, which played a critical role in the company’s comeback last decade. And yet, the company doesn’t appear to have any new category of products on the horizon. Absent new types of gadgets to lure people in, offering new experiences would seem to be a strategic way of continuing to make sure the stores remain a destination.

"Today at Apple" will offer programs with more than 60 different hands-on sessions in creative skills. The free sessions, which have been offered at Apple's flagship Union Square store in San Francisco since last year, will cover topics such as photography, videography, music, coding, art, and design. “At the heart of every Apple Store is the desire to educate and inspire the communities we serve,” said Angela Ahrendts, Apple’s senior vice president, Retail. “‘Today at Apple’ is one of the ways we’re evolving our experience to better serve local customers and entrepreneurs. We’re creating a modern-day town square, where everyone is welcome in a space where the best of Apple comes together to connect with one another, discover a new passion, or take their skill to the next level. We think it will be a fun and enlightening experience for everyone who joins.”Many sessions will be taught by highly-trained Creative Pros, which Apple describes as the "liberal arts equivalent" to its technical Geniuses. In select cities, Apple says world-class artists, photographers, and musicians will also teach sessions from "basics and how-to lessons" to "professional-level programs." "Today at Apple" will cater to all skill levels and ages, with special programs such as Teacher Tuesday and Kids Hour targeted towards families and educators respectively. Other sessions will focus on professional software such as Final Cut Pro X and Logic Pro X, or coding with the Swift Playgrounds app for iPad. Teachers can come together for Teacher Tuesday to learn new ways to incorporate technology into their classrooms, or aspiring coders of all ages can learn how to code in Swift, Apple’s programming language for iOS and Mac apps. Families can join weekend Kids Hour sessions ranging from music making to coding with robots.Apple said each of its stores will receive large displays created specifically for "Today at Apple" sessions. Each store will also have updated seating and sound. Apple has already renovated dozens of its existing retail stores with these next-generation features since 2015, with dozens more locations to follow this year. Apple has been redesigning its stores under the leadership of retail chief Angela Ahrendts, the former CEO of luxury fashion brand Burberry. Ahrendts wants to position Apple Stores as not only shopping destinations, but also as gathering places for the community. "Meet me at Apple," she envisions someone as saying. Video is available in the United States only Ahrendts, in a new interview with CBS This Morning: “A lot of the big online guys have said they’re opening stores. Amazon’s investing in stores. Google’s investing in stores. ... Starbucks figured it out, you know? Being a gathering place for – right? ‘Meet me at Starbucks,”’ Ahrendts said. “And you know, I’ve told the teams, ‘I’ll know we’ve done a really, really great job if the next generation, if Gen Z says, “Meet me at Apple. Did you see what’s going on at Apple today?”’”Apple's latest next-generation store will open at Dubai Mall on April 27, the company recently announced. Related Roundup: Apple Stores Tags: Angela Ahrendts, Today at Apple [ 95 comments ] Top Rated Comments (View all) ugahairydawgs 16 hours ago at 08:07 am I like the idea, but for many stores I don't see how this can be executed well. For the newer stores where spaces for things like this have been set aside I can see this really being great. But when I go to an Apple Store it is generally the one at the Mall of Georgia. It has the traditional Apple Store layout and setup, so it's narrow and deep and almost always completely overcrowded. They have a table setup towards the back near the Genius Bar where they try to teach classes. Some poor employee at the store has to wear a mic and try and teach people how to use their device or whatever it is they are training on that day. It's incredibly awkward and takes up a lot of space at the expense of the vast majority of the people that are there to get their phone or computer fixed. Unless they are going to do a re-org to the existing store model layout, I don't see how this doesn't do anything other than make an already crowded place even more overrun with people.

While Apple’s terms of service explicitly state that the company can use refurbished units as replacements, the judge ruled that Apple can only issue refurbished replacements to customers who initially purchased a refurbished unit. “If a plaintiff had purchased a refurbished or replacement iPad, Apple may replace it with a refurbished or replacement copy,” the judge said. “But if the consumer, as in this case, purchased a new iPad, She is entitled to a new iPad as a replacement.” Apple faced a similar complaint last July in California, where a class action lawsuit was filed arguing that refurbished replacements for devices bought new don’t live up to the company’s pledge to deliver replacements “equivalent to new in performance and reliability” after a refusbished replacement also failed to work properly. The company recently began offering superior iPad Air 2 models to customers eligible for a replacement of their fourth-generation iPads, with reports claiming Apple is running low on stock of the discontinued model.

During the Code Media conference in February, Apple said the show would debut in April, but a launch party scheduled for March was postponed without explanation, and another rescheduled for this Monday was also scrapped. A statement from CBS Television Studios echoed Apple’s vague timeline, saying, “We’re excited about our ‘Carpool Karaoke’ for Apple Music, and look forward to everyone seeing it later this year.” Comments Delaying? I bet Cook or someone with a brain saw a finished episode of this truly bad idea and decided it never makes the light of day.

Apple will launch new educational sessions in May in all of its 495 stores across the world, the company said in press statement. The hands-on sessions called ‘Today at Apple’ will include topics ranging from photo and video to music, coding, art and design, and more. Apple is bringing on-board trained team members to lead these sessions. In a select few cities, world-class artists, photographers and musicians will give educational sessions at Apple Stores. “At the heart of every Apple Store is the desire to educate and inspire the communities we serve,” said Angela Ahrendts, Apple’s senior vice president of Retail. “Today at Apple’ is one of the ways we’re evolving our experience to better serve local customers and entrepreneurs. We’re creating a modern-day town square, where everyone is welcome in a space where the best of Apple comes together to connect with one another, discover a new passion, or take their skill to the next level. We think it will be a fun and enlightening experience for everyone who joins,” Ahrendts added. Apple will have special educational sessions for families and educators. For example, teachers can experience Apple products and technologies to reinforce the same in their classrooms. Further, Apple’s programming language for iOS and Mac apps Swift can be learnt by children as well. Apple has sessions for individuals as well. For example, iPhone photography enthusiasts can go with six How To sessions designed to teach shooting, organising, editing, and more. Programmes like Photo Walks, which cover techniques including light and shadow, portraits and storytelling; are build for advanced photographers. Apple’s ‘Today at Apple’ offers programmes with more than 60 different sessions in creative skills such as Studio Hours, Kids Hour which include coding with Sphero robots, making movies together with iMovie, Photo Labs, Music Labs and more. Apple’s Pro Series for advanced users lets them explore Final Cut Pro X and Logic Pro X with sessions on colour correction and grading. It includes post production, audio mixing., editing for emotion, and more.

Home Macs | 20 Apr 2017 | Listen  | Print  | Comment (15) iLife and iWork Apps Now Free for Everyone by Josh Centers Once upon a time, Apple used to charge for nearly all its software, and especially productivity apps like the iLife and iWork suites. However, back in 2013, Apple made those apps free with the purchase of any new Mac or iOS device (see “New Free iLife and iWork Apps Share across Devices and Platforms,” 22 October 2013). Now, with no announcement or fanfare, Apple has made the current iLife and iWork apps entirely free for all users. Just to be clear, the change affects the following apps: GarageBand for macOS (requires 10.10 Yosemite) and iOS (requires iOS 10.2) iMovie for macOS (requires 10.11.2 El Capitan) and iOS (requires iOS 9.3) Keynote for macOS (requires 10.12 Sierra) and iOS (requires iOS 10) Numbers for macOS (requires 10.12 Sierra) and iOS (requires iOS 10) Pages for macOS (requires 10.12 Sierra) and iOS (requires iOS 10) This is good news for holdouts who haven’t purchased a new eligible Apple device since 2013 but are running a supported version of the operating system and would like copies of the iLife and iWork apps. And it makes explaining the pricing easier for Apple. Why didn’t Apple just make these apps free for everyone in the first place? The answer likely lies deep within Apple’s accounting department. Back in 2013, Apple made iLife, iWork, and OS X 10.9 Mavericks free and bundled them with every new Mac and iOS device sold. That move enabled the company to delay recognition of a portion of its sales receipts. That’s because the product (a Mac or iOS device) wasn’t “fully delivered” without updates to the software — it’s a “subscription accounting” approach. In its Q4 2013 financial quarter, Apple delayed recognition of $900 million in revenue, in essence hiding that money from the quarterly report (see “Apple Q4 2013 Results See Lower Profits Again,” 28 October 2013). That may answer the question of why Apple is now making these apps free for everyone. According to Daniel Eran Dilger of AppleInsider, the deferred revenue trickles back into Apple’s reported revenues over 2 years for iOS and 4 years for the Mac. It has been about 4 years since this deferral likely began, implying that Apple has finally cleaned the associated deferred revenue off its books. In the end, this change doesn’t mean much. Any effects from iLife and iWork becoming free — on competing apps, on Apple’s revenues, and on the perceived value of Apple hardware, for instance — have already taken place. Most people who want to use the iLife and iWork apps have likely either bought copies already or purchased new hardware since October 2013. We suspect that sales to owners of older Macs and iOS devices have dropped to the point where it was no longer worthwhile for Apple to bother charging for the apps anymore.

Receive comments via RSS Add a comment Alfonso Scenna  2017-04-20 15:51 For people with older iOS devices, unless you are able to run iOS 10 you cannot download the now free apps. Reply Jim Schmidt  2017-04-24 12:32 Yep, I found that out last night. I went to download Pages on my iPad, and found out I couldn't because I don't have iOS 10 on it. I went to upgrade the OS... and found out my iPad is too old for 10. Sad. Reply Ian Orchard  2017-04-24 20:08 I've got the same problem with my beloved MacBookPro that is now deemed to be obsolete by Apple. I can't upgrade my current copies of iWork because it can't run Sierra. Now if only I could find a way to stop Pages & Numbers from nagging me to upgrade. Reply Jeffrey Puritz  2017-04-20 17:33 You're an optimist but my lengthy experience with Apple tells me that like Aperture these apps are in for a long slow death by neglect. Sadly, I think that this is true for the mac as well. Apple is only interested in the products with the most revenue and it shows. Reply William C Roberts  2017-04-25 09:27 I agree about "death from neglect". When apps become free, it means the developer, Apple, is no longer going to improve them. Eventually Apple will stop supporting them. Ultimately the apps will stop working. Reply Adam Engst   2017-04-25 09:49 But you have to remember that the entire point of making these apps — and the operating systems! — free was to add value to the hardware. Apple has never made significant money on software; the lion's share of the revenue has always come from hardware. As long as the software encourages hardware sales in a real way, it will keep getting attention. And, in fact, Aperture shows that charging money for an app makes no difference to Apple. My guess is that Apple will keep these apps going for a long time, but that users shouldn't expect the pace of development or innovation to compete with hungrier independent developers. Reply Frans Moquette  2017-04-20 18:15 Free may seem like a good thing, but nothing is really free. In this case we will be paying for these apps through hardware purchases, if we use an app or not. Then there is the question of app quality. Since Apple is not making any money off them anymore there is no stimulus to make these apps so good people will be willing to pay for them. The option to vote with our wallet has been taken from us. One sad example is the latest version of Numbers for iOS. The complaints and 1 star reviews are pouring in but Apple seems to be deaf and blind to them. Now that Numbers is free there is even less reason te expect Apple to do anything about this bad update. Reply Paul F Henegan   2017-04-21 03:55 No, they are not "free for everyone", only for those who have also upgraded to macOS X 12 or later. As Alfonso Scenna observes above, unless one is willing and able to run the very latest OS, there is no invitation to the party. Reply Adam Engst   2017-04-21 09:39 You're right that these apps have specific system requirements, and we've updated the article to make this completely clear. However, that doesn't change the fact that the apps are indeed free for everyone. Your ability to run an app is separate from its price. Reply Karen Kirtland  2017-04-24 19:55 The upgraded 5.2 version of Pages I tried using was terrible when compared with the older 4.0 versions. It functions too much like the awful Word program for me to use it. I wouldn't upgrade any of my perfectly functioning iWork programs, free or not, based on the extremely negative experience with Pages alone. Reply Phil Seymour  2017-04-24 21:15 They are free because the latest versions are crap compared to 09 versions. Thankfully I have kept the older versions of Pages, Keynote, Numbers, iMovie, GarageBand and iPhoto. I have the new versions, too, but if I have creative work to do, I use the older versions that were designed with uninterrupted creative workflow in mind. Reply Andrew Daws  2017-04-25 03:09 Anyone know how to get the iLife 11 version of iPhoto? I need it to open an old library Reply Jolin Warren  2017-04-25 07:14 There seem to be old copies available on eBay. You could possibly pick up a used one for a couple of dollars. http://www.ebay.co.uk/bhp/ilife-11 I also might have an old copy which I don't need anymore, but would have to check when I get home. Email me at tbcomment.2017.jolinwarren@xoxy.net if interested! Reply Jan van Es  2017-04-25 03:11 But what about people that are unable or unwilling to install the latest versions of MacOS? I cannot find any option to download (or buy) an older version of apps like Keynote, Pages, Numbers, etc. (Nor can I find any info about which version of those apps is compatible with which version of MacOS.) Reply Adam Engst   2017-04-25 09:44 There is a fair amount of information on Wikipedia about the versions. For instance: about Keynote: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynote_(presentation_software As much as it would be nice if Apple gave all old stuff away for free, or even kept old versions available for sale, I presume they've done the math and determined that it would be a significant expense that would benefit very few people because those who don't upgrade to new hardware tend not to buy (or even download) new software either. One of the basic corollaries of sticking with old hardware is that you shouldn't assume it will ever do things beyond what it could do when it stopped being supported. Macs stay functional for a long time, which is great, but they won't gain new capabilities (via new software) after a certain point, and they will start to lose functionality (through lack of compatibility with current software) after that.

Sometimes it's not really Apple's fault, like in the case of one company cloning a popular game with enough tweaks to make it not an exact copy and releasing it to the App Store. In those cases I don't expect Apple to be fully aware of every game concept ever invented, and generally the more egregious clones get publicly shamed by the community as a form of punishment. Not that that prevents the cloners from becoming rich in the meantime, but I digress. However, oftentimes there are situations where I blame Apple completely. One of the most famous examples of what I'm talking about is when a fraudulent Pokemon Yellow was released on iOS. The game literally did not function past the title screen, and obviously used art assets illegally. It wasn't until it had reached the #2 overall position in the App Store charts that Apple finally pulled it from the store. Even before the explosion of popularity brought on by Pokemon Go [Free], the Pokemon name and Pikachu in particular (who was featured prominently in the fake app's icon) are among the most well-known brands around. Even if you didn't watch or play Pokemon in any fashion, chances are you've at least HEARD of Pokemon and would recognize that iconic yellow rabbit/cat/squirrel creature, no? So how exactly did that Pokemon Yellow get by Apple in the first place, and how did it manage to stick around long enough to nearly top the paid charts? Well, that was more than 5 years ago, and surely things have improved since then, right? Not exactly. Over the course of the past several months or more, I've noticed a disturbing new scam app trend on the App Store. Developers (or sorry, "developers" I mean) have been yanking the screenshots from some of the most popular Steam games and attaching them to games they upload on the App Store with names that are identical or very close to those same popular games. The screenshots look legit, the names sound familiar, but once you've actually paid for and downloaded the game, what you get is far from what you were promised by the page in the App Store. Recently, this practice was on display in hilarious fashion thanks to the tweeting of Cabel Sasser, co-founder of Panic, Inc. who published Campo Santo's critically acclaimed video game Firewatch last year. This is Cabel playing through the awful clone New Firewatch which arrived on iOS a few weeks ago and has since been pulled. And here's my LET'S PLAY of the [complete rip-off] iOS game, NEW FIREWATCH!!! Enjoy!!! pic.twitter.com/QuloTCTwxD — Cabel Sasser (@cabel) April 4, 2017 Of course having someone who is actually involved with the real Firewatch was helpful in getting the fake New Firewatch pulled off of the App Store, but what about all the others? A similar thing happened in January of last year when the dubious Minecraft 2 arrived in the App Store looking all official and tricking many people into downloading it thinking it was an actual sequel to Mojang and Microsoft's mega hit. Again, the attention that was brought to the clone also led to its fairly swift removal, but how the heck does something like that get through in the first place? Is it really possible there are people working in Apple's approval department that haven't heard of Minecraft? And of course, there are plenty more examples. Back in December Carter had to issue a PSA warning that all versions of Totally Accurate Battle Simulator (aka T.A.B.S., an upcoming game from developer Landfall that's in alpha but has created a huge amount of buzz for its silly physics and hilarious YouTube videos) on the App Store were in fact fakes. In February, a scam version of another promising upcoming indie game called Astroneer was uploaded to the App Store and we had to issue another warning not to download it. The same "developer" who uploaded Astroneer had also uploaded a bogus version of Rust a few weeks prior, which is yet another popular PC indie game. The comments on our Astroneer post were filled with readers who had come across many more bogus apps that ripped off even more beloved indie hits like ARK: Survival Evolved, Hello Neighbor, Pit People, Undertale, Superhot, and more. It's an epidemic I tells ya! To Apple's credit, we've heard they are very good about refunding those who have purchased any of these scams, and once they're notified of an offending scam they're pretty quick to take them down. But it seems like it shouldn't have to get to that point, right? Like these shouldn't even be making it in the App Store in the first place. Out of curiosity, I decided to take note of whenever I'd see a game title that was trying to ape a familiar PC indie game when I'd scroll through the Appshopper new games feed, and just in the last week alone, this is what I've come up with. CLUSTERTRUCK! Gang Arena Battle The Neighbor - Horror House Edition New Night In The Woods HARRY’S MOD - STEALTH HORROR HOUSE Hi Neighbor - A Stealth Horror Game Night In The Woods! THE NEIGHBOR: House Of Mystery Gang Battle - Arena Fall Flat THE NEIGHBOR : HORROR MISTERY HOUSE EDITION.

H1Z1: KING OF THE BATTLE KILLING FLOOR HORROR GROW UNDERSEA BATTLE NEW RAFT SURVIVAL 2017 Yeah… Keep in mind, this was just my own cursory observation and I've not actually downloaded the above titles to see if they are in fact some sort of broken scam version of those popular desktop titles. But the M.O. is almost identical throughout: Very good looking screenshots, a paid game between $2.99-4.99 with no IAP, a description that is almost always copied verbatim from the Steam page even so far as to not changing the actual title to whatever the scam app is calling itself. This is just after a week, and I'm positive I missed a few while scanning the lists. What really sucks is when these scams fly under the radar and are able to stay in the App Store for weeks and even months, suckering in more and more people along the way. People who may or may not know how to ask for refunds, or even that they were scammed at all. This really feels like something Apple needs to nip in the bud themselves, before these "games" even get a chance to be released. I think that they get such an obnoxious amount of app submissions on a daily basis that they've come to almost entirely rely on an automated process, one that is failing to catch these otherwise blatant scams. And this is just this specific type of scam, don't even get me started on how many new games I see released that have simply ripped the sprites from popular arcade games from the '80s and '90s (think Final Fight, Street Fighter II, Mortal Kombat, Contra) and simply dropped them into a stock beat 'em up engine and released them as separate paid apps several dozen times over. That's a whole other ball of wax, friends. The bottom line is that something needs to be done, and I don't envy Apple's position as being the one to try and figure it out. But the App Store already has a spotty reputation over the years, and lately it seems like it's gotten even more out of control. Hide yo kids, hide yo wife, and definitely hide yo unreleased indie game projects before someone makes a terrible mobile version of it. 'Family Guy - Another Freakin' Mobile Game' Hits the App Store Google Play Awards Returning for 2017, Honoring Best Android Games justcallmedewey Not like Apple will do anything as long as they can make money off it http://adamsimmersive.com Adams Immersive Apple often drops money makers from the App Store for breaking rules. And a bad user experience in the end loses Apple money, which they know. RB There's no excuse for this. When a dev sets up a new app in the App Store, and the game title uses known keywords there is a warning that appears stating that the name may be infringing an existing trademark/app. So there is already a mechanism for flagging submissions. There is already an approval process. Why games with established known names slip through is a bigger question. Also, you would think a developer could lose their account over this, and yet you state multiple scam apps have been released by the same developer? Google has a 3 strikes policy. I was under the impression Apple was even stricter. http://adamsimmersive.com Adams Immersive This is on Apple for sure. I really think the only solution, though, is an easy way for users to flag and explain scams. Automatic keyword warnings won't detect trademarks from non-iOS games, nor names intentionally altered to avoid detection. And Apple can't limit reviewer hires to those who stay immersed in the latest indie releases and upcoming alphas for both consoles and PCs worldwide. (I certainly never heard of most of those examples. And that Firewatch could appear functional depending what you did in a brief test.) So, crowdsourcing is the only way, I think. And as you say, don't allow repeat offenders. (Except it's a piece of cake to make a new developer account with a new name, if a scam pays enough to be worth repeating. And of course if a game doesn't launch at all, that should be caught. RB Yes, user flagging might help. The argument against that is usually that competitors could flag each other's products... (There's always a wrinkle, isn't there.) Where I think your argument about devs making new accounts falters is saying it's easy. It costs a yearly fee, which might not matter as you said, but in order to receive payments for paid apps, Apple requires business registration information including what they call a DUNS number, as well as bank info for payment deposits. I think an actual human also called me on the phone when I created my account. I can't imagine a dev actually also registering new businesses with their local government body, getting a new tax number, new bank account, etc. At some point there is going to be duplication of business information, bank account numbers, etc that an automated system could easily flag. Then a human could check the history tagged to that info. http://adamsimmersive.com Adams Immersive They'll eventually fail to make a new account, but I fear that will go on (in some countries) for more cycles than we like. Money finds a way, and criminal groups can have at least as many bank accounts as the people they employ for their identities. The bigger the scam operation, the harder to stamp out. Flagging can work with the usual safety measures I think: 1) it's not automatic, it goes to review by humans and 2) accounts that repeatedly flag falsely can get ignored. Remember that competitors already have a way to flag each other's products: just claim a trademark violation, and the burden is on the accused to take it to court. Case in point: StoneLoops of Jurassica. sadikyo Completely agree that this is an issue that needs to be addressed. I understand issues will occur but what is the process for fixing? For example, look up Terraria 2 in the app store - it is exactly what you are talking about here. It seems people have brought it to Apple's attention but it is still there? Pedro Rama da Silva Playing devils advocate here, Apple is notbhere to judge without formal complaint. Sure they fitler a lot, but heck I dont expect Apple to poloce the app store for copyright infringement. Whoever has had their rights damaged has to complain and then let Apple decide. Another thing is customer awareness. Who in their right mind buys off something shady? Well tough on them I say. One of the biggest rip offs i have seen is "game guides", which apparently means an app has a deceivingly equal name to a AAA game but then you go and it is just a game guide,which you have to pay for but sometimes is copied from a freely available one,namely on gamefaqs. http://adamsimmersive.com Adams Immersive Agree on those useless game guides! DTK Nice, good work! Even if Apple has to refund the money to some people, Apple still deserves to all those who do not claim a refund. The Appstore is totally contaminated in the area of ​​the Games. At least in Germany. All this with these cheap gambling games, such as "one-armed bandit" and "three-in-a-row games", of course also the whole pile of copies (everything in many annoying colors). But the whole Appstore Interface is also overtaken! Earlier than there were a few hundred apps, this was perhaps enough. But now something should change! But apps that offer good search criteria are suppressed by Apple! Why? Because Apple earned a lot of money through this bad system. Steve Jobs would turn around in his grave if he knew what the appstore was looking like! http://adamsimmersive.com Adams Immersive I've never experienced the situation, but it's my understanding that if an app reaches the point of actually getting pulled after launch, it's not just those who ask who get a refund: ALL users get one automatically, and the developer doesn't receive the money. So, as long as a new solution pulls more apps that deserve it, refunds should be taken care of. Stormourner of the Nature *cracks my knuckles* I wanna send the scammers to hell >:( Stormourner of the Nature someone better call Jim Sterling madreviewer Who downloaded games without looking at the publisher name? My rule is If it's not a company name but someone's name it most likely will be a fake- at this point I will do my research. I am not as upset as I should be because this carelessness can cause apple to accidentally upload a GBA4iOS emulator in the AppStore http://adamsimmersive.com Adams Immersive Yes, the company name can be a good red flag to look for if you already know Firewatch (or whatever example) is a known property from a known publisher. But many of the downloaders probably don't know that, and lots of good indie games are made by just one person, with no company name. And then you have people who COULD know better, but don't think to check the publisher name, just expecting the App Store to deliver what it says. There will always be those people, and then the app climbs the charts... adding an appearance of popularity and legitimacy to fool even more people. yogg sarons cousin I never ever download an app with a Chinese Dev name , and I almost never with a Russian name to Stormourner of the Nature even with an english developer name CarlRJ Truth be told, I basically never search or browse on the App Store, always come in from external links from legit review sites - for games that's mostly TouchArcade and PocketTactics (though sadly the latter doesn't have its former glory). But it's a shame that Apple's less wary / more trusting customers get, hmm, not exactly thrown to the wolves, but given very little in the way of safety net. If your company positions itself as "we make computers/smarphones easy and joyful for _normal_ (non-gamer/non-programmer) people to use", those normal people shouldn't need an education on what to _absolutely not buy_ in your own company-run store. InTheAir I've just come to understand that the majority of people who get games through the app store than me, which I totally understand. It's just so disappointing to see that market be exploited with legitimate scams. dancj It's a problem, but last time I tried Android it was way worse. Looking for apps that I know exist on the Play Store, the search results bring back loads of rip-off apps and it's really hard to find the genuine one. I've never had that issue on Apple's App Store. korossyl But whenever one of those stealth emulator apps gets on the store, you can bet it'll be gone in about 72 hours...! Stormourner of the Nature here's a true reason for seeing too many scams on Apple app store: not all the Apple staffs are expert on games dancj True. That list of games from the last week didn't contain a single name I recognised, so I certainly wouldn't have realised. http://www.risinghigh.net Kevin Wolstenholme We've had well over 100 cloned and stolen copies of our games taken down, only for the very same developer to upload them a few days later. I can assure you within 10 minutes I can find you dozens of stolen games and although Apple will remove them after a few weeks, the developers account remains. Why after being proven scammers ( on multiple occasions, not just 1 "innocent naive mistake" ) their accounts are not banned is beyond me. The criminals know there are no repercussions, and so it continues - It'll never be beaten, but at least hit them with 100 bucks for a new account and the inconvenience once they're found. Great article Jared and thanks for raising this issue - I usually avoid surfing the store now, as within 5 minutes I see our games staring back at us - That'a why TA is the best curation there is! AH Game this! "their accounts are not banned is beyond me. The criminals know there are no repercussions, and so it continues - It'll never be beaten, but at least hit them with 100 bucks for a new account and the inconvenience once they're found." go apple!!! darkfyra I recently seen lots of "games" with stolen assets(mostly WOW)(it's one of those games where you collect units,it's automated and you mostly look at the game playing itself) and a chinese app with screen and artworks stolen from Diablo 3.Also I don't know if we should be fine with all the clones cropping up all over the freaking places that I call the Gameloft problem.Generic games mostly hack and slash or mmos with no care at all for the story,basic gameplay,automated combat and quest that always announce that they are the best or the revolution but are always the same crap.Also all those generic rpgs flooding the rpg tags and always full of ads and even iap in the premium version.We really need a quality control because I'm always sad when I see some of those craps on top or best reviewed and actual amazing games never get any love(exemple Asobimo mmo release vs Order and Chaos(that sound a bit too Warhammer like....so how did that even pass and the artstyle is ripped out from WOW so how this company has not been striked down yet) boydstr I am not a long time user of the IPhone some 2 years but my experience with the lack of positive costumer support with game related issues but I think that unclear legislation about costumer rights why is there a difference when for example you buy a cd and when you want to play it you see there is a big scratch on it I think that you go back to the store to ask for another cd or a refund so why is this so different when buying in the AppStore when I bought BioShock in the AppStore and after some months the game stopped working I contacted Apple for a refund and they saying to me that it was not their fault and they bring a platform where developers could sell their games so I contacted the gays that made the mobile version and you can guess....they saying that the game stops working because the iOS update so the costumer is loosing his money it is a feeling of total disrespect for the costumer and this is something that I can't take. DemoEvolved Frankly they should just pay TouchArcade a weekly $$$ to provide a list of scams they come across in the natural course of doing their jobs. Win/win/win TouchArcade/Apple/Customer http://toucharcade.com Eli Hodapp I actually have a really funny story about that I'll have to share sometime when I'm no longer connected to any of this and no one cares anymore. ETC37 I think a large part of the problem is that these scam developers are mostly ripping off early-access indie games that really only have any popularity because of YouTube. Unless Apple has die-hard gamers who also follow YouTube on its approval team, then I don't see this problem getting solved anytime soon. Beth Thank You! I'm not the only one this is annoying to death. I send Apple so many emails reporting these fraudulent apps. Doubt it makes a difference but ....I can't always find the real developers info to send them a message.... At one time Every single title from Ninja Kiwi was being ripped off by some idiot ....Really now who approves this? Apple must be hiring people who live under rocks and no jack about games. A few weeks ago I saw Terraria 2 floating around...Seriously do these morons approving this junk not have google! The AppStore is so huge yet, managed so poorly! http://javatune.co drunk_vader How about false advertising? I've seen an action RPG with a promo video and screenshots taken directly from WarCraft 3 and was advertised as such (skill icons, game asssets directly taken from W3) - but upon opening the game it was completely different. The good news is, it didn't cost a thing to download.

Here's a rundown on what it is and how to turn it off Business & Tech 15:08 25 Apr 2017 Jessica Kelly 17 hours ago If you're an Apple user, you may have noticed the arrival of iCloud Drive and wondered what exactly it entails. If you own more than one Apple product, you may have also noticed it is using up an awful lot of storage space.  The idea with the iCloud Drive is that all o your files are stored in one place and are accessible no matter where you or your device are. It's even compatible with a Windows device.    What is iCloud Drive? iCloud is Apple's cloud solution. iCloud Drive seeks to take on Google Drive and become the one-stop-shop for every file and photo on your devices.  It enables users to pick up where they left off if terms of creating or editing files on different devices.  It's important to note that if you use iCloud Drive across a number of Mac devices, files edited within the Desktop or Documents folders will sync across the board.  Setup iCloud Drive automatically appears on any Apple device running the latest software.  Apple will automatically save files within your desktop and documents to the iCloud, meaning these files are accessible no matter where you are. While it is very useful, it completely eats up your iCloud storage space.  Users looking to utilise the feature fully will have to buy iCloud storage space as Apple doesn't give much space for free. Prices start at €0.99 per month for 50GB.  It's important to note that iCloud Drive will sync all files using your mobile data unless you change the settings. It can end up being quite expensive, so it's worth changing this in your settings.  Settings > iCloud > iCloud Drive and at the bottom of the next page toggle ‘Use Cellular Data’ to Off. It's possible to view items stored in iCloud from any device, regardless of the operating system by visiting iCloud.com.  Opt-out If you don't want your devices to be connected in this way or don't fancy paying for cloud space, you can disable it.  System Preferences > iCloud > iCloud Drive Options From here, deselect 'Desktop & Documents' folders at the top of the list.         15:08 25 Apr 2017 Jessica Kelly 17 hours ago 4 Related articles The self-charging battery could be on the horizon Q&A: How is technology modernising An Garda Siochana?

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: Martin Hajek Someone actually built the ugly iPhone 8 design everyone hates Chris Smith @chris_writes April 25th, 2017 at 9:18 AM Share Tweet Designing next-gen smartphones is no easy task, especially when you also have to invent new technologies that enable you to meet your design goals. According to several reports, Apple is having a big problem in this area with the iPhone 8. Apple is looking to deliver some features that haven’t been seen before in any iPhone — or any widely available smartphone from the competition — but the complexity of these new features will seemingly either delay the device, or force Apple to compromise. Don't Miss: New renders finally show the iPhone 8 design we want We’ve seen various iPhone 8 design leaks and mockups, and they’re not all the same. Most of them agree on the fact that the iPhone 8 will feature an all-screen front side. But we have at least two different designs for the phone’s rear, including an ugly one everyone hates that we hope never gets made. A few recent leaks showed a purported iPhone 8 design that features a fingerprint reader on the back, and someone went ahead and 3D printed it, complete with a protective case for the mockup. Found by Chinese blog igao7 and shared on SlashLeaks, these three images show how big the iPhone 8 might be compared to the iPhone 7 Plus and iPhone 7. They also show a purported iPhone 8 case, complete with unsightly openings for the dual camera on the back and the fingerprint sensor. One of the biggest problems Apple has to deal with concerns the fingerprint sensor. Apple wants to embed it beneath the screen, something that hasn’t been done before on a widely available phone, but the process may be tricky and could lead to launch delays. The other solution is to do what every other smartphone maker has done, including Samsung with the Galaxy S8, and that’s to place the fingerprint scanner on the back of the phone. Yes, placing the sensor on the back is inconvenient, but Apple may be forced to do it. A Bloomberg report last week did say that Apple is toying with various design ideas for the handset, and that integrating the fingerprint sensor into the OLED screen would be “technically challenging.” Tags: Apple, iPhone 8 View Comments Trending 1 Tech Behold: This Galaxy Note 8 blows the Galaxy S8 out of the water 2 Tech The iPhone 8 will destroy the Galaxy S8, if this leaked benchmark is true 3 Science NASA’s Cassini spacecraft has one final mission, which ends with destruction 4 Tech Apple’s iPhone 8 delay is starting to sound like great news 5 Deals Amazon’s secret sale on Alexa smart plugs is still going Picked For You The inside story of why Tim Cook almost kicked Uber off the App Store By Yoni Heisler April 24th at 7:45 AM New renders finally show the iPhone 8 design we want By Zach Epstein April 24th at 12:16 PM NASA’s Cassini spacecraft has one final mission, which ends with destruction By Mike Wehner April 25th at 7:22 PM Advertise About Contact Copyright 2017 BGR Media, LLC Powered by WordPress.com VIP | Privacy Policy | Your Privacy Rights | Terms Of Use ad Post to Cancel

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 25 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman „Today at Apple” Bringing New Experiences to Every Apple Store CUPERTINO, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Apple® today announced plans to launch dozens of new educational sessions next month in all 495 Apple Stores ranging in topics from photo and video to music, coding, art and design, and more. The hands-on sessions, collectively called “Today at Apple,” will be led by highly-trained team members, and in select cities world-class artists, photographers and musicians, teaching sessions from basics and how-to lessons to professional-level programs. “At the heart of every Apple Store is the desire to educate and inspire the communities we serve,” said Angela Ahrendts, Apple’s senior vice president of Retail. “‘Today at Apple’ is one of the ways we’re evolving our experience to better serve local customers and entrepreneurs. We’re creating a modern-day town square, where everyone is welcome in a space where the best of Apple comes together to connect with one another, discover a new passion, or take their skill to the next level. We think it will be a fun and enlightening experience for everyone who joins.” The free programs focus on the features of Apple products customers love most, across all skill levels and ages. For example, an iPhone® user interested in photography can start with six How To sessions that cover shooting, organizing, editing, and more. More advanced photographers can join experiential Photo Walks that leave the store to dive into techniques including light and shadow, portraits and storytelling. Going further, a Photo Lab features accomplished photographers on topics such as capturing candids, building a brand on social media or simply sharing their perspective.* Apple will also offer special programs for families and educators. Teachers can come together for Teacher Tuesday to learn new ways to incorporate technology into their classrooms, or aspiring coders of all ages can learn how to code in Swift™, Apple’s programming language for iOS and Mac® apps.** Families can join weekend Kids Hour sessions ranging from music making to coding with robots. Small business owners can engage with global and local entrepreneurs in the new Business Circuits program.* Many sessions will be taught by new Creative Pros, the liberal arts equivalent to Apple’s technical Geniuses. Each Creative Pro is an expert in one or more areas of the arts, and highly trained to pass along their knowledge to Apple users of all levels. “Today at Apple” Programming “Today at Apple” offers programs with more than 60 different sessions in creative skills, including: – Studio Hours are Apple’s version of a professor’s office hours. Creative Pros host 90-minute sessions on topics from art and design to documents and presentations. Anyone is welcome to bring in a personal project for advice from experts, or to use the space to work alongside others. – Photo or Sketch Walks help attendees go beyond capturing moments by exploring new techniques hands on as they interact in their local community. Photo Walks include sessions such as framing architecture or capturing action on video, while Sketch Walks explore observational drawings, watercolor and brush techniques, and more. – Kids Hour is designed to spark imagination and creativity through fun, hands-on projects. Sessions include coding with Sphero robots, Creating Music with GarageBand®, and Making Movies Together with iMovie®. – Coding sessions are meant to introduce anyone to coding through Swift Playgrounds™, an iPad® app designed to make coding interactive and fun for beginners. These sessions will explore coding concepts with the same code professional developers use every day.** – Photo Labs bring in talented photographers to experiment with new techniques and styles or uncover a new point of view in hands-on sessions. Similarly, Music Labs explore different genres and beats to introduce new tools to musicians of all levels.* – Pro Series take advanced users on a deep dive into Final Cut Pro® X and Logic Pro® X with sessions on color correction and grading to post production, or audio mixing to editing for emotion, and more.* – Perspectives and Performances, offered at select stores, feature influential artists and musicians talking about their creative process or sharing their talents live. To deliver the new programs, each store will receive new Forum Displays, mobile screens created by Apple’s design team specifically for “Today at Apple” sessions, and updated seating and sound. “Today at Apple” will launch worldwide in May, with sessions in every store. *In select stores **In most countries Apple revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 25 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Apple Dubai Mall Opens April 27 DUBAI, United Arab Emirates–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Apple® today premiered its newest store in the Middle East, Apple Dubai Mall, with a 186-foot curved storefront and balcony overlooking Burj Khalifa and the Dubai Fountain. Envisioned as a space for the community to gather, learn and be entertained, Apple Dubai Mall will serve as a venue to watch the spectacular evening fountain shows and host Apple’s new global in-store experience, „Today at Apple,” also announced today. “We view our stores as a modern-day town square, where visitors come to shop, be inspired, learn or connect with others in their community,” said Angela Ahrendts, Apple’s senior vice president of Retail. “And what better place to come together than overlooking Dubai’s epicenter, where the Dubai Fountain, Burj Khalifa and Dubai Mall meet. We are so honored to have a home at one of the world’s most incredible and dynamic intersections.” At the heart of every Apple Store® is the drive to educate and inspire. “Today at Apple” will launch at Apple Dubai Mall and in all 495 Apple Stores next month with new sessions across photo and video, music, coding, art and design, and more, led by highly-trained team members. Apple Dubai Mall will also host high-profile events including live music, intimate conversations with film-makers and photographers, and live workshops with some of the world’s top talent. Events on opening day include Live Art with Myneandyours, and Artist Duos with musician Hamdan Al Abri and artist Sultan Al Ramahi. New Creative Pros, the liberal arts equivalent to Apple’s technical Geniuses, will teach “Today at Apple” sessions and offer individual advice and training to help customers take their creative skills to the next level. All of the store’s 148 employees are ready to welcome customers from around the world and speak a collective 45 languages. Like many of Apple’s other significant stores, Apple Dubai Mall aims to be open and transparent, blurring the barriers between inside and out, to erase the boundaries between the store and the community. To mitigate Dubai’s climate, Foster + Partners designed eighteen 37.5-foot-high motorized “Solar Wings” that respond to the ever-changing environmental conditions. When the sun is at its hottest they cool the store, and in the evenings they open to welcome everyone to the public terrace. Inspired by the traditional Arabic Mashrabiya, each “Solar Wing” is locally fabricated from 340 carbon fiber reinforced polymer rods, and at 180 feet wide, the 18 panels make up one of the world’s largest kinetic art installations. Apple’s first two stores in the United Arab Emirates have welcomed more than 4 million visitors since opening in Dubai and Abu Dhabi 18 months ago. Apple will reach even more visitors from around the world at Dubai Mall, Emaar’s flagship mega-project and the world’s most-visited retail and lifestyle destination, welcoming over 80 million visitors for the past three consecutive years. Apple’s location overlooking the lake will stay open as late as midnight to everyone exploring the area. Upcoming events, registration and more information is available at: apple.com/ae/retail/dubaimall. Apple revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984.

Apps iOS Apps Mac Apps Accessories Tips Jailbreaking Jailbreak Tweaks How to Jailbreak Unlock Devices iPhone iPad Mac Apple Watch Apple TV Deals Latest Deals These are key iPhone 8 production issues plaguing Apple and its suppliers Christian Zibreg on April 25, 2017 5 Corroborating yesterday’s report by KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Asian outlet Nikkei said Tuesday that customers may in fact be unable to get their hands on Apple’s upcoming iPhone 8 until late October or November at the earliest. According to industry sources, volume production of so-called Tenth Anniversary iPhone has hit a snag as suppliers struggle to perfect key components including curved OLED panels, wireless charging components and miniaturized printed circuit boards, among other parts. Apple and its suppliers are still working to resolve the production issues contributing to the delay. For example, suppliers are struggling with overheating issues in wireless charging modules and the new wireless charging board still isn’t working properly. Moreover, Apple’s exclusive OLED panel supplier, Samsung Display, is facing challenges “in delivering what Apple wants,” with one analyst mentioning a possible one-to-two-month delay in mass-production of OLED panels for the device. “Samsung originally planned to begin churning out OLED panels in May but now the schedule will likely be pushed back to the end of June or sometime in July,” said Brian Huh, an analyst at research company IHS Markit. Prior reports shed light on how Samsung and its Korean suppliers could dominate the iPhone 8 supply chain for some time. Samsung’s display-making arm, which produces more than 90 percent of all OLED panels for smartphones and tablets, will convert its TFT-LCD manufacturing facility to a 6G flexible OLED plant to meet Apple’s needs but that factory is not expected to kick off volume production of OLED panels for iPhone 8 before the fourth quarter of 2017. Apple has also designed a much smaller, stacked printed circuit board for iPhone 8 to allow a more powerful two-cell battery for the device and make room for other components like 3D-enabled cameras, additional sensors for a True Tone-capable display and other goodies. On that front, there are still some quality issue to overcome to achieve smooth mass production of the new logic board, said Sean Kao, an analyst at IDC.  For the uninitiated, a yield rate measures the quantity of usable or saleable units coming out of a batch of components at the end of a manufacturing process. Lastly, iPhone 8 is expected to adopt advanced 3D NAND flash memory chips that may be in short supply as well. Summing up, Apple’s suppliers are still afflicted by low yield rates and won’t be able to ramp up production until they overcome any production challenges. The prolonged yield problems could force Apple to pre-announce iPhone 8 in September even though the handset may not become widely available until late October or November. For what it’s worth, Nikkei states that the iterative LCD-based 4.7-inch iPhone 7s and 5.5-inch iPhone 7s Plus updates will include other improvements such as a glass body. Those devices should be available shortly following Apple’s expected announcement in September. All things considered, Apple is planning a massive new iPhone launch come this fall, hardly a surprise given the pent-up demand for an overhauled iPhone, the tenth anniversary of the iconic handset and a massive pool of iPhone 6 owners who are now ready to upgrade. “The placement of orders is much more aggressive than the previous two years but not as high the year when they rolled out iPhone 6 in 2014,” said a semiconductor industry executive whose company has already begun to ship small quantities of memory chips for iPhone 8. Yesterday, KGI Securities told clients that production ramp-up of the OLED-based iPhone models could be delayed to as late as October-November compared to the usual August-September timeframe, due to “increased production difficulty.” iPhone 8 concept by Benjamin Geskin for iDropNews Source: Nikkei Tagged: Apple iPhone iPhone 8 JB News Nikkei Rumors MORE FROM iDB iPhone 8 dummy indicates Touch ID embedded in OLED display iPhone 8 could boast L-shaped battery and True Tone display, retain Lightning connector KGI: iPhone 8 could launch in extremely limited supply in September Jamessmooth Not to worry everyone!

According to the document shared by Viticci, the changes only affect affiliate referrals for apps, with other iTunes and iBooks Store content like music, movies, TV shows, and books still receiving the 7 percent rate. So, yeah, this change in affilate commissions pretty much sucks. We don’t rely on links alone (thankfully), but we’ll be affected by it. pic.twitter.com/85V94DBPqQ— Federico Viticci (@viticci) April 24, 2017 It’s a seemingly strange move on Apple’s part, given both the short notice (affiliates were given just one week of warning) and the dramatic rate of the cut (almost 65 percent). And while most users won’t be affected by the changes, developers who rely on affiliate links for their apps to generate extra revenue could see a hit to their income. Given Apple’s focus on giving developers more revenue with initiatives like the changes to subscriptions last year (which gives developers who can maintain annual paying subscribers an improved 85 / 15 percent revenue split with Apple instead of the usual 70 / 30), it’s curious to see the company clamping down on a small but significant source of income for developers. The move also has other, more subtle ramifications, given that many sites that cover apps (including MacStories, where Viticci serves as editor-in-chief) rely on affiliate links for additional revenue. Those sites could be forced to turn to other sources of funding, including more ads and sponsored content, depending on how reliant they were on the affiliate commissions.

News of the changes broke during a CBS This Morning segment. A spokesperson for Apple says no specific date has been set for these changes to be implemented, but that the program will launch sometime in May. Today at Apple is just a part of what is the company’s biggest store redesign in 15 years. Apple is also adding conference and meeting rooms, new video screens, and living trees to about 100 locations by the end of this year; it’s also changing the name of the Genius Bar to “Genius Grove” in some — but not all — new and newly-renovated stores. Photo by Nick Statt/The Verge The evolution is based on the major changes in store design that Apple debuted in Brussels in 2015 and furthered at its new Union Square Park location in San Francisco last year. The new look and feel they bring is meant to turn Apple Stores into a figurative, and on some levels literal, town square. For example, Apple wants small business owners and startups to come to the conference spaces in select stores to get advice from developers and entrepreneurs. Roles at the Genius Grove will also become more specific, offering targeted help with skills like music and photography. Free programs ranging from the basics to full-on experiences The Today at Apple programs will range from teaching how-to information to what the company calls “professional-level programs.” Apple says in a press release that, for example, it will offer basic skill sessions to budding photographers, photo walks to more advanced shooters, and talks from professionals on brand building and social media. Apple will also offer coding classes based on the company’s Swift Playgrounds app, as well as project-based sessions for kids. "The over-arching vision of the future of Apple retail ... is what do we want Apple's role in the community to be," Angela Ahrendts, Apple’s senior vice president of retail, told The Verge at last year’s San Francisco event. "The store becomes one with the community." Ahrendts was hired away from her post as the CEO of Burberry in 2013 in order to run the “strategic direction, expansion, and operation” of Apple’s retail and online divisions. "This is more than just a store," Ahrendts said last year. "We want people to say, 'Hey, meet me at Apple.'" Update April 25th, 10:33AM ET: Added new information from Apple about the educational programs and clarified that some of the new design aspects were originally debuted in Brussels in 2015. Update April 25th, 4:27PM ET: Apple has clarified that it only plans to change the name of the Genius Bar in some stores, and that there is no set date for modifications to stores in anticipation of the Today at Apple rollout. Larger changes based on the company’s new store design concepts will be made to 100 of its stores, but those modifications won’t necessarily be made to the 100 biggest as reported by CBS.

Not everyone needs a disc drive, which is probably why Apple got rid of them in the MacBook Pro. The world is going digital and that means music, movies, etc. are becoming more popular as streaming options, rather than shoppers buying them on physical discs. That doesn’t necessarily mean that the DVD is completely obsolete, though, as many people still use them. However, that doesn’t mean you’re completely stuck if you have a newer MacBook Pro or another computer that doesn’t have a disc drive. External DVD drives exist for this very reason, and they easily plug into a USB port on your MacBook and away you go. The best part is, you don’t need to pay a lot of money for an external DVD drive, as many of them can be bought for around $30. Here are the best ones that you can buy for your MacBook. Apple USB SuperDrive This is a pretty obvious option for MacBook owners. Apple has its own external DVD drive known as the SuperDrive, and it comes with the same aluminum design as the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air, so it’ll match your setup nicely. The only downside is that it’s $79, which is really steep for an external DVD drive, but it’s really the only way to go if you want a matching design. LG Ultra Slim Portable External Drive LG’s external DVD drive is a good option for those looking for a cheaper option than Apple’s SuperDrive, as it’s only $33 on Amazon. The drive can burn DVDs and CDs, and it works on both Macs and Windows PCs. Furthermore, this drive includes M-Disc support, which is a type of disc that’s more physically resilient and will theoretically last longer than a regular DVD disc. This is probably something that most users won’t really need to worry about, but it’s nice that the drive includes the support for it anyway, just in case. Samsung Ultra-Slim Optical Drive Perhaps the cheapest option that we’ve seen (as well as the slimmest), is Samsung’s Ultra-Slim external drive, which measures in at a cool 14mm thick, making it one of the slimmest options available, as well as the cheapest, ringing in at only $25 on Amazon. The drive supports OS X and Windows, and it even has limited support for Chrome OS and Android. You can’t burn a disc on Android, but you can use it to read/watch DVDs. And like the LG model previously, this one also supports M-Disc. Asus External Slim Drive If you prefer an external drive with a disc tray (rather than slot-loading), then the Asus External Slim Drive is the one to get. It’s also one of the cheapest options we’ve seen at $24 on Amazon, but it’s a rather thick drive because of the disc tray, which takes up more space. However, it comes in a beautiful white finish with a stylish diamond cut design that would look great on any desk. Samsung Slim Blu-ray External Drive If it’s a Blu-ray external drive that you’re after, then this Samsung drive for $79 is the best option by far. It’s obviously a lot more expensive than just the regular DVD drives, but it allows you to watch Blu-ray movies, as well as burn Blu-ray discs. Perhaps the best part about this drive is that it only needs one USB port to function, whereas other Blu-ray drives sometimes require two USB ports in order to get sufficient power. The price is a bit steep, but if you really want Blu-ray capabilities, it’s definitely the drive to go with. 13 Responses 01/29/2015 Jwhite Reply I think articles like these are silly in that they suggest Macbooks require some special sort of external DVD drive; they don’t. That said, DVDs are getting more than a little stale. This might has well have been an article on “Best Floppy Drives for your Macbook,” because hey, I’m sure somebody somewhere still uses floppy drives, and they don’t come standard on Macbooks. Even if you do need a DVD drive occasionally, chances are that you’ll use it so rarely, a $20-$30 drive will meet your needs. It seems like a much better article would be “Most efficient, economical ways to migrate your DVD collection.” Just saying. 12/13/2015 Sharusz Reply Tell that to the people who make all the ESL books. All student and teacher books still come with CD’s or DVD’s. I want to take my new macbook pro to class, I need something to play the listening/video materials on. (At least we don’t have cassettes anymore…) 12/04/2016 Douglas Bates Reply Don’t assume you know what I need. I’m a musician, and all of my music friends use optical drives. Anyone who makes or uses even medium size slide shows or video is better served by a disc than by the cloud. While it may be convenient to store school, home, and business documents in the cloud where they can be accessed from different devices, an optical disc is the only safe secure backup. 09/23/2015 susie connolly Reply I found this an excellent article. Thank you, it’s given me the options I wanted. 09/28/2015 rachcrompton Reply Yep, it helped me a lot too. I have dvd’s i wanna watch and i still struggle with the technology of swapping, copying to usb…..and worry about space on my computer as i’m not great at understanding how to manage it. An ext dvd drive is easy ‘low’ tech fix for now till i gain more understanding of technology. Thanks for posting 12/03/2015 Dale Benedix Reply I would have liked it if the article stated which of the various DVD drives needed 2 USB connections, as it said some drives need this in order to get sufficient power. Also with the proliferation of USB standards, it would have been nice to say what the connections were as well as if any could use thunderbolt. 12/13/2015 Carl Borbons Reply I agree with Dale especially since my 2015 MacBook Pro only has one USB port. The SuperDrive in my 2009 MBP refuses to allow me to insert a DVD so I’m not so inclined to buy an Apple external drive, but I need something to search my DVD photo archives. This article presented interesting options. 03/13/2016 Edward Reply Thank you for this helpful article… 05/02/2016 laura Reply can I import my CDs into my iTunes on my macbook air using this device? 05/12/2016 Rebekah Reply Do any of these work with the newer version of the MacBook in which you have to use an external USB port since the computer doesn’t come with a direct USB port? 05/27/2016 Van Phan Reply Thank you for this helpful article 07/02/2016 Joe Reply > articles like these are silly in that they suggest Macbooks require some special sort of > external DVD drive; they don’t The article DID NOT suggest any such a thing. However, some drives DON’T work with Macs. > DVDs are getting more than a little stale Talk about a silly comment. It makes no sense what so ever. 04/25/2017 Bryan Organ Reply As a photographer entering exhibitions around the world, I have found several who require my snaps burnt to a DVD. Eg Guernsey Salon. Also the Fédération Internationale de l’Art Photographique (French) require when you apply for accreditation that your snaps are burnt to disk.

Writing for Investor’s Business Daily, Patrick Seitz says “Apple Prototype Smartglasses Giving Employees Eye Pain: Report.” (Tip o’ the antlers to Philip Speicher.) While Gizmodo, the source of the report, focuses on how Apple’s injury reports can give you clues about what Apple’s working on, Investor’s Business Daily plays up the prototype causing injuries. You know, the Macalope has used commercially available VR products that have made him want to hurl up his hay and somehow all we hear about is how Apple is behind in this market. Apple appears to be working on some sort of smartglasses with a wearable display… Some sort of thingamajig. A doohickey. A hoozits or whatsits that may or may not come with the jibberjabber. Too early to say at this point. What we do know is that it will blind you. Better A or B? A? Or B? A? B? BZZZZZT AAAAAGH, A! BETTER A! …but the device has caused eye pain for at least a couple of testers… At least a couple. That is to say two. Probably a good time to demand that Tim Cook resign. The first person “experienced discomfort in her eye” and was referred to an optometrist for treatment. The second “reported eye pain”. Sources were unable to confirm whether or not a third was experiencing a severe reaction to Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony subsequent to testing the device, but it’s probably safe to assume. Gizmodo said a source inside Apple speculated that this injury might have something to do with an augmented-reality product Apple may be testing. Way to go out on a limb, there, unnamed source inside Apple. The Macalope could have speculated that. So could Jimmy down at the Tastee Freez. Although, Jimmy is pretty savvy about technology and really keeps his ear to the ground. His YouTube channel is lit. One time he blended a Mac Pro. Not the little trash can, mind you, the big aluminum one. The company could not be immediately reached for comment. HOW MANY PEOPLES EYES HAVE EXPLODED AS A RESULT OF THIS PROTOTYPE? MORE THAN OR FEWER THAN TWO DOZEN? The Macalope looks forward to the day Apple rumor mongering reaches its inevitable, fully weaponized conclusion and we are finally able to judge products Apple hasn’t even thought of yet.

Donklephant Primary Navigation Please select a menu in this location Home Software iPhone 8 to be Released Two Months After the iPhone 7s By Elena Anderson. Published on April 25, 2017. 0 According to the latest rumors, Apple will come with a new completely new designed iPhone 8 this year. We remind you that the iPhone 6 was released two and half years ago and since then, the company has kept the same design on its iPhone line. Reports are suggesting that the iPhone 8 will come with an edge-to-edge OLED display with 4mm bezels surrounding it. However, the bad news is that the release date of iPhone 8 might be pushed back with a few months. In the past weeks, we’ve seen some reports claiming that Apple is trying very hard to release its iPhone 8 in September 2017, but other reports were saying that this device will actually be delayed 1-2 months. Ming-Chi Kuo, a well known analyst, mentioned in a research notice that the iPhone 8 will be released sometime in October or November 2017, as Apple has an array of custom components that are destined for the iPhone 8 and that it will not have enough supply in time for a September launch. According to a report that has surfaced a few weeks ago, it seems that the supplier responsible for creating the iPhone 8’s advanced 3D camera modules will need a bit more time in order to have enough supply to meet the high demand. We’ve also seen some analysts saying that the iPhone 8 is delayed because Apple has noticed that it didn’t get too much attention, despite its efforts to integrate the Touch ID sensor into the device’s OLED display. A delay for the release of iPhone 8 can be good for Apple, as a release of this device in late November could boost the sales for the Christmas. Being a new device, everyone would want to get their hands on it and this holiday could be perfect to make their wish come true. Do you think that iPhone 8 will be released in September or it will be delayed for 1-2 months?

As per the latest information, the smartphone's mass production might be pushed back by a couple of months as the hardware component upgrades custom-ordered by Apple might pose production barriers for the company. Well-known Apple analyst KGI Ming-Chi Kuo has said that the cutting-edge hardware upgrades might delay the launch of iPhone 8 but the launch of the regular variants - dubbed iPhone 7S and 7S Plus, is expected to happen around same time as usual, as per a report by 9To5Mac. These aforementioned hardware upgrades include an OLED display, Apple's own A11 10-nanometer SoC, 3D sensing cameras, and a redesigned 3D Touch module, as per the report. Interestingly, the supply shortage for the OLED display variant of the iPhone aka iPhone 8 has been tipped to continue "for a while" even after the launch. As the regular iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus variants have been tipped to sport same design with internal upgrades from their predecessor, KGI expects the phones to appear pale in comparison to some of the recent Android phones with bezel-less design. The analyst has even revised his estimates to predict that a total of 80-90 million units of the new iPhone models (including iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, and iPhone 8) will ship in the second half of 2017, down from earlier estimate of 110 million units, as per the report. Although the highest-end variant is expected to face supply issues, the Cupertino-based company is likely to announce all three models at its launch event later this year in fall.

Home Politics Sports Entertainment Technology Write For Us Contact Us Aussie Network News Home Politics Sports Entertainment Technology Aussie Sphere Apple AirPods Australia: When and Where to Get Them By Lynnette Guzman https://twitter.com/lyntgzmn1 on December 22 2016 10:53 AM PHOTOGRAPH: Apple/AirPods | Apple/AirPods Apple AirPods Australia started arriving on December 19 Down Under. The Cupertino-based company unveiled the Apple AirPods Australia last September 7 during the launch of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus. Its latest flagship phones do away with the traditional headphone jacks. Hence, the innovation of headphones using the power of Bluetooth as earlier speculated. Yet another difference from before is the new Apple AirPods Australia coming at a separate price of US$159 (AU$208). 9 to 5 mac reports that customers who ordered early online would likely start to receive theirs starting December 19. Those unable to do so reportedly lined up outside Apple Stores in the city. As expected, demand for the AirPods is high. However, as early as now, Tone Deaf cautions users to be careful with their new wireless earbuds as the cost of replacement could be more worrisome than availability. The publication cites the fineprint from the official iPhone service pricing page stating a fee for replacing a lost Apple AirPods Australia or its charging case. As stated, the battery service price is AU$69 each while a misplaced earbud would set a user back by AU$99 each. Meanwhile, replacing a lost charging case will cost a user AU$99. Nonetheless, favorable feedback from users in Australia and New Zealand could make it a sensible expenditure. Indeed, the pairing process between the earbuds and the iPhone device is reportedly praiseworthy. Moreover, it offers improved sound quality than earlier presumed. And here they are. About 50 pairs on shelves, more in the back and 6 demo pairs. Demand was high, people ran in store. Me included. pic.twitter.com/qg2c1gAqfX — Nic Morris (@nic_morris) December 18, 2016 Recent rumors about the Apple AirPods Australia hint at a possibility it would pair up with the MacBook Pro 2016. The company remains quiet on the subject. However, with the improvements to its other devices, the rumor might not be a farfetched idea. Let us know what you think.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Software Latest Google Photos for iOS Update Adds AirPlay Support for Apple TV By Uzair Ghani 19 hours ago 12Shares Share Tweet Submit Google Photos for iOS version 2.14 has been released and it lets you stream your photos and videos to an Apple TV. Have an Apple TV But no Chromecast? Don’t Worry, You Can Stream Your Photos & Videos to the Big Screen Ever since its big release on iOS a couple of years back, Google Photos never had the ability to stream photos or video straight onto an Apple TV using AirPlay. While people will be quick to point out that you still could using AirPlay Mirroring, but that doesn’t quite cut the mustard compared to proper, native streaming of content over a protocol that has been around for years. Related New iOS Jailbreak Tweak Displays Exact Time When Notification Was Received The latest Google Photos for iOS update changes everything, allowing users to stream their photo and video library using AirPlay straight onto an Apple TV. This means you don’t have to fiddle around with AirPlay Mirroring just to get your snaps on the big screen. And if you don’t own a Chromecast either, then you are absolutely golden with the latest release, provided you have an Apple TV in the first place. Advertisement The full changelog of the update is as follows: • View photos and videos on your TV using AirPlay • Performance improvements The latest Google Photos update is being pushed out to everyone over the air and it’s likely that you have the latest build installed on your iPhone or iPad already. If you don’t for some reason, then you may head straight over to the download page by tapping on the link below. Download Google Photos for iOS Compared to Apple’s very own iCloud Photo Library, Google Photos is a great way to backup your photos and videos in the cloud. If you opt for high quality uploads instead of original, then you’ll be pleased to learn that you can upload unlimited content in the cloud. And the best thing is that you can access your photos and videos from any platform at all straight from the Web.

Rating:  4.5 Typical Price:  £779.00 Pros:  Best battery life on the market; Gorgeously curved, premium-grade metal and glass design; water and dust proof; lightning-fast processing power; well-optimized and polished software package; superb camera and display; great audio quality Cons:  UI has some missing bits and gimmicks; fingerprint scanner placement not left-hand friendly; lacks higher-tier onboard storage (128GB) model; gorgeous curved glass design can be tricky to hold and may be fragile - a case is recommended, which sort of diminishes the aesthetics Verdict:  A really rather fantastic phone which sets the bar for 2017 very high indeed. It's super expensive, but it's packed with amazing technology and the overall package is highly rewarding to use. Best of all it has unbelievable battery stamina facebook twitter google+ It's time folks. The Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ are now out in the wild for all to enjoy. We've had our hands on the Galaxy S8+, the larger model, for a little over two weeks now and we're ready to tell you just what it's like to get to grips with day-in, day-out. So without further ado, let's crack on... Samsung Galaxy S8+ Review: Design & Build Good or bad smartphone visual design is, of course, subjective, and it’s fairly safe to say that anyone who’s been unimpressed by Samsung’s aesthetic to date is probably not going to be swayed by the Galaxy S8+. Likewise, fans of the firm’s prior devices will be just as happy with the latest edition as they were with what came before. The main thing is that the Galaxy S8 series has only become curvier and more streamlined than its already notably curved predecessors; the corners are completely smoothed and rounded, while the curvature of the edge display follows a continuous line from front to back where it meets a perfectly symmetrical rear panel, with only a thin sliver of bodywork separating the two. The top and bottom edges are also curved but it’s not as pronounced and doesn’t curve the display itself along these edges. Holding the phone it’s very apparent that you’re gripping what virtually amounts to a solid piece of curved glass - yes there’s a metal frame holding it together, but it’s barely noticeable. This actually presents the first stumbling block for the Galaxy S8+; in my time with the device I never felt entirely safe holding onto it; it’s slippery as anything and the edges are so wafer thin coupled with the curved slippery glass surface. Samsung allegedly tweaked the edge curvature to improve grip but I don’t really feel this has been successful and I’d strongly recommend some kind of case to improve grip more substantially and prevent drops. That particular gripe aside, the Galaxy S8+ feels incredibly solid in terms of its construction; there is zero wobble or flex in the frame or component panels, and it’s got a nice bit of heft to it without being heavy. You’ve also got the reassurance that it’s an IP-rated water resistant handset, so there’s no fear in taking it near the wet stuff. Aesthetically I rather enjoy the Galaxy S8+ design, it’s still got that quasi-industrial style that is so popular just lately with the punched speaker grille and emphasis on metal and glass, but the added curviness does lend it a certain unique presence that is very futuristic and elegant. Our review unit is the black coloured model, which Samsung has made entirely black; the glass, the metal surround, the fittings and furniture. Everything is black. This again gives it a very sci-fi, 2001: A Space Odyssey obelisk-like appearance. It’s a “stealth” phone, the kind of thing Batman might design. However, the shiny glossy glass does also show up fingerprints a fair bit, particularly on this black model. It won't stay pristine for very long. Of course you can get other colour options which are not quite so extreme and feature metallic trim that’s a bit more visible. Here the detail of the visual design is a bit more apparent. Samsung Galaxy S8+ Review: Display Samsung has been playing the long game as far as display technology is concerned. It started investing heavily in OLED while everyone else was saying it was too complicated or expensive, even though many could see it would outclass LCD if done properly. The firm also started developing flexible OLED way ahead of everyone else and is now starting to reap the benefits of that as a market leader. Rivals such as Apple are now looking to source flexible OLED from Samsung's factories. Samsung’s history with OLED hasn’t always been smooth, there have been some tough learning experiences - early on the firm’s screens came under flak for some instances of poor colour calibration and pixelation due to earlier PenTile technology. But it persevered, and is now the undisputed ruler of the OLED market, which also virtually puts it in position as the dominant force in the display market too - OLED is now widely recognised as superior to LCD, so much so that Apple and many others are jumping on the bandwagon. For anyone who has seen the Galaxy S7 EDGE or the Galaxy S6 EDGE in person, the display of the Galaxy S8+ will be familiar territory. It curves around the edges of the handset just like before, and it has an Always On function so that even when in sleep mode it’ll show the time, date, and some notifications while barely consuming any power at all. However, as the bodywork has expanded on this model, the display size and ratio has also increased. The display is now a 6.2in Super AMOLED - nearly as big as the Galaxy Note - but the screen pushes out to much more of the front fascia, indeed, the phone’s front is virtually all screen with an 84% screen-to-body ratio and an 18:9 aspect ratio. As the screen and aspect ratio has expanded, the resolution has increased accordingly to 1440 x 2960 WQHD+ (3K) at 529 pixels-per-inch (ppi). The image quality is what we’ve come to expect as typical for a Samsung flagship. In a word; superb. It’s incredibly sharp with no pixelation or blurring to be found. Text in particular is very crisp. It also features a full 100% DCI-P3 colour gamut, the very same one used on 4K TV sets and certified by the UHD Alliance for Mobile HDR Premium. In short, if content has been produced for 4K UHD Premium TVs, it’ll look as good on the Galaxy S8+. A new high saturation “Deep Red” OLED display technology Samsung has implemented here means the Native Colour gamut has a wider range too, well over 100% coverage for both DCI-P3 and sRGB. This, together with the excellent brightness levels (as much as 20% brighter than the Galaxy S7 and peak brightness over 1,000 nits) makes outdoor use in bright sunlight a breeze. All of the previous standout features from Samsung’s Galaxy S7 display have returned, including the excellent adaptive brightness and contrast, user-adjustable colour profiles, performance and power saving modes, and the acclaimed personalised auto brightness control feature. The customisable EDGE display features, which allow you to configure quick access shortcuts along the curved screen edges, has also been expanded. It’s quicker and easier to set up, and you can add applications, contacts, and a selection of smart editing tools, all on three customisable and swipe-able panels; it’s a bit like having a whole separate selection of homescreens hidden in the display edge. From using the phone I can certainly say the colour is rich and vibrant, in Samsung’s typical style. Contrast is also fantastic with inky deep blacks and viewing angles are insanely wide. The long and the short of it is this is a gorgeous display with fantastic visual quality and smooth touch input. I can’t really imagine anyone getting tired of ogling or prodding this screen after any length of time, and it’s highly tailorable to your needs as the viewer. You really can have it your way by tweaking the settings however you please. We should note that some users in Korea have complained that the Galaxy S8 has a red hue to the display and tweaking the display colour settings doesn’t seem to fix it. Samsung’s official response so far is to issue the following statement: “It is not a quality problem and it can be adjusted with the phone itself. If the color still appears to be reddish, customers can change it at the service center.” It’s our understanding that this isn’t a problem on every unit, but it is something we’ll be keeping an eye on and will update you with as more info emerges. Update: According to The Korea Herald, Samsung has now acknowledged the red-tint display problem and is working on a fix, the firm issued a statement as follows: "Because there are some complaints about the red-tinted screens, we decided to upgrade the software next week for all Galaxy S8 clients." Samsung also issued instructions to its Service Centres regarding the issue, saying, "There will be an additional update to make color revisions more minutely at the end of April" Samsung Galaxy S8+ Review: Battery Life Long battery life is pretty much the Holy Grail for many smartphone users these days. There are plenty of flagship-grade smartphones which offer relatively good battery life, and a few which offer excellent battery life. It’s not too rare now to find devices such as Samsung’s Galaxy Note series, the Huawei Mate 8 and 9, the bigger iPhone Plus models, and Google’s Pixel XL which will still see you sitting comfortably at somewhere around the 70%-76% range for the battery charge after watching a two hour movie on full brightness. This sort of usage tends to translate into being able to watch films pretty much for eight hours straight on a single charge. Likewise, you tend to end up with a phone that’ll last days, or even a good chunk of a week if largely left idling, ticking away between 7%-10% per day. But this will probably last a day and a half at most if you’re like most of us and are often giving it a poke for some reason or another throughout your typical day. You can bring that down further again if we’re talking a lot of intensive stuff like gaming. So where does the Galaxy S8+ and its 3,500mAh setup fit into this? Well for the two hour movie test using Mad Max: Fury Road, on full brightness, with the film downloaded to storage, and Wi-Fi and other connectivity switched off, it went from 100% charge to, get this, 86%. Yes you read that right, a two hour film on full brightness only cost 14% of the battery charge. This is madness. I kid you not I have never seen anything quite like this in my time of reviewing smartphones. I reckon upwards of 10 hours of movie playback is not at all unrealistic here. You can easily expect a couple of days of normal smartphone use on a single charge, in some cases perhaps three, and if you leave this phone alone save for a few calls or the occasional email, web browsing session or message, it will last you a good three or four days, possibly more. In short, the Galaxy S8+ has the best battery of any smartphone I have ever tested. It just keeps going. I've pretty much only had to charge it a couple of times since I got hold of it. Granted, I am sure you will still be able to burn through it in a day if you really push things, but let’s be real here, no smartphone will survive on a single charge if you insist on playing Super Mario Run or Star Wars Lego from dawn until dusk, only taking breaks to watch YouTube in between.  But for most standard users this is a dream come true. This is a phone you can rely on to be alive and kicking from when you leave the house in the morning right through to the next day, and you don't have to be too careful with it to achieve this, as long as you don't rinse it like crazy. At the very least this kind of battery usage makes it easier to plan around. I have not been caught short by the Galaxy S8+ leaving me high and dry unexpectedly as so many other phones are liable to do. Samsung Galaxy S8+ Review: Camera The much-rumoured dual-lens camera for the Galaxy S8+ hasn't come to pass, sadly, which did leave me wondering how much attention the phone's imaging capabilities would receive. To be clear, however, Samsung camera hardware has impressed me for some time now; the last handful of flagships have always sported very capable cameras which, for me, had the perfect combination of "right stuff". What do I mean by this? Well for one thing Samsung stopped chasing the megapixel rating, instead opting to increase the pixel size, and crucially go for better apertures. It started off with wide f/2.0 but has gradually improved this to where we now stand with an f/1.7 aperture on a 12MP sensor - nice and open, letting in lots of light and detail. But this alone isn't enough to ensure good quality photography. Several iterations of Samsung's hardware have been plenty capable, but with the last generation it introduced what was, at the time, a unique feature; dual-pixel phase detection autofocus. The Samsung Galaxy S8+, like its predecessor, is still one of only a few handsets to use this technology, and it really makes a difference in terms of focusing speed and capture speed. This means the image is captured very quickly after focusing (also very quickly), so that the wide aperture doesn't let in too much light and cause blurring, overexposure, and other undesirable consequences. In other words, the Galaxy S8+ is fine tuned down to fractions of a second so that it's optimised to take a photo in the best way possible. Together with Samsung's wonderfully simple and user-friendly camera UI, this also means it's very easy to use by all comers, not just photography buffs - another pillar of what I'd consider the "right stuff" for a mass-marketed  flagship. It really is easy to just point, click, shoot, and capture amazing quality photos in next to no time. Naturally, there is also the now the required "Pro" mode for experts to fine tune things like exposure, ISO, focus, and white balance, amongst many other settings. So what's the result? Well as you can see the images speak for themselves. The colour is rich and vibrant in Samsung's typical style, but the detail, sharpness, and dynamic range are all fantastic. The handset particularly excels at close-in shots and there's no need to tweak the settings to Macro mode in order to achieve this; standard Auto mode will do it just fine with a quick tap-to-focus on the subject before hitting the shutter button. I'm pretty blown away by how crisp everything is. The Auto features also seem to be very intelligent in adjusting for different lighting conditions; plenty of snaps in less-than-ideal light, which on any other phone might come out a bit dull or far too over-exposed, seemed to adjust and get things just right to make a fantastic, crisp photo with excellent range and colours which pop. This also means the phone excels in low-light and night-time shooting. The sunset shots below show this in an outdoor scenario, but the photo of the wine bottles was taken indoors, in the evening, in a hallway with no windows; I was to all intents and purposes, in the dark while taking it. What's more, even with the flash on Auto, the phone didn't bother to use it, and it obviously knew it didn't need to - despite all this the photo looks like a perfectly normal daytime shot in a reasonably well-lit room. In truth, I am not sure I've seen a phone that handles low-light and night-time shooting this well before. It's much, much better than the Huawei Mate 9's dual-camera which I've been using on my holiday, and which was rather disappointing in low-light. The front camera - the first in the world to feature autofocus - is plenty capable too, and also excels at close-ups. Check out the lion statue below which was taken on the 8MP front snapper, which also features the same f/1.7 aperture as its rear-mounted sibling. Naturally things aren't quite as sharp as the main sensor, but they're still damn impressive and should offer you some of the most detailed selfies available. Maybe too detailed, as you won't be able to hide any blemishes quite so easily without heavy use of filters and post-processing! Overall I'm tremendously impressed with the Galaxy S8+ camera. I wasn't expecting big changes from Samsung with the dual-camera being axed, and in truth, it has not changed the setup extensively from its predecessor. However, what small tweaks that have been performed have been very careful and precise, and they've made a huge difference to the overall quality and shooting experience. Top marks here. Samsung Galaxy S8+ Review: Hardware Our review unit is the international SM-G955F Galaxy S8+ model, which is the edition powered by Samsung's 64-bit Exynos 9 8895 octa-core processor. This CPU features four 2.3GHz  Exynos M2 "Mongoose" cores and four 1.7GHz ARM Cortex-A53 cores, under ARMv8 microarchitecture on 10nm FinFET semiconductor fabrication. It also packs  a Mali-G71 MP20 GPU clocked at 546MHz and 4GB of LPDDR4X RAM. All of those fancy words and numbers boil down to the fact that it's equipped with one of the top three mobile processor designs in the world at time of launch. Some reports from the states suggest that the US model, running a 10nm Qualcomm Snapdragon 835, is getting slightly higher performance results. But after a certain point of high-end hardware and the extensive software optimisation we've seen in recent years, it seems to stop making much of a difference; at least as far as the end user experience is concerned. Indeed, this is the reason that Apple has stopped revealing much of what it does to its processors between new iPhone models - as long as it maintains the same high standards of software performance, consumers don't seem to care. Other OEMs appear to be catching on too. There were similar apparent disparities in performance between the Galaxy S7's various processor variants, again both Exynos and Snapdragon editions. However, extensive testing by various online experts and pundits ended up with a general consensus that there wasn't much in it. I suspect the same may turn out to be true here, though naturally I should temper this by recognizing it as an assumption, and pointing out the fact that I haven't had a go with a Snapdragon 835-based model; and probably won't have the opportunity to do so with it being a US-exclusive. All that said, the long and the short of it, which I must boil things down to, is this; does this phone's performance behave in a way I'd expect of a brand new Samsung flagship, in 2017, based on the latest processing hardware? Does it feel as fast and responsive as it should, as per what we've come to expect from the brand? And to these questions, the answer is yes.  Android 7.0 Nougat is overlaid with Samsung's newest UI and it's clear that an immense amount of effort has been made here to ensure the smoothest and most fluid experience possible. You won't find any snagging or stuttering at all, and app load speeds are incredibly quick, near-instantaneous; quicker for those which don't immediately ping for data from the internet. It is one of the fastest and most responsive handsets I've used for some time, in particular the touch input feels significantly more refined than most rivals. It doesn't balk at multitasking either, happily racking up app after app in the background, and the memory seems intelligent enough to keep switching smooth when restoring a hibernating app. One of the more intensive things you can ask of a phone is gaming. Let's face it, these days the flashiest games with the best graphics are generally shameless brand cash-ins and/or massive pay-to-win micro-transaction farms with very little substance. The fun and innovative titles tend to lean more to the simple, retro, artistic or even pixel-based graphics and aren't really that demanding anyway. But I digress. I tried out a handful of titles of varying levels of graphical intensity; CATS: Crash Arena Turbo Stars, Nonstop Chuck Norris, Ninja Arashi, and Dawn of Titans. Most of these ran like a charm with no hiccuping, and unlike older phones on less efficient CPUs there was very little heat on the back panel. However, I should point out that Dawn of Titans was the most graphically demanding title and the only one the phone struggled with, both in loading times and in some snagging during play. It wasn't clear whether this was an issue with the phone or possibly poor optimization on the part of the game developer, an all too common problem. So I got hold of a few more demanding games to test the theory; CoverFire and Gangstar Vegas ran much smoother but were not quite as heavy on the high-end textures, particles and post-processing effects. Warhammer 40,000: Space Wolf, Star Wars: Force Arena and N.O.V.A Legacy, on the other hand, were a bit more flashy and ran perfectly fine. N.O.V.A Legacy in particular was buttery smooth and just as impressive graphically as Dawn of Titans, which put my concerns about performance started by the latter to rest once and for all. As a final note, you can see from running Geekbench benchmarking tests the Galaxy S8+ outpaces a lot of the competition... Moving away from the CPU, the phone's audio via the speakers is quite impressive in quality and maintaining this at high volumes. I also found the off-centre positioning of the rear fingerprint scanner has finally brought me round to the back panel position which I'd previously hated. It is definitely a natural place for the forefinger to rest, though I should mention this is as a right-handed user; I doubt the same could be said for lefties as your finger must cross the camera lens and it's a bit of a stretch. The Type-C USB port is a welcome sight to make charging a bit less fussy, but the charging speed is also noteworthy as it's pretty damn quick. It also seemed to me that the dual-band Wi-Fi onboard was particularly robust in terms of connection quality. The handset also has full GPS connectivity, 4G LTE, NFC, and Bluetooth 5.0. For onboard storage 64GB is decent, but I can understand some power users wondering where the 128GB edition is considering the size of some apps and content these days - it's in China, matter of fact, along with 6GB of RAM. Expansion is welcome via microSD with support for up to 256GB, which is great for content that is supported this way on Android, but it's not a one-size-fits-all fix for people who'll find 64GB lacking. Samsung Galaxy S8+ Review: Software & UI As I outlined above, the performance here is great, this is an incredibly well optimised software package and runs about as well as stock Android Nougat does on the Pixel series. But it's not just the performance that impresses, I'll cover the other good stuff before getting on to my gripes and grumbles. A lot of the positive points are returning features; things like the Always-On display showing notifications, and the date and time even when the phone sleeps; and it really doesn't sap your battery life in a noticable way at all. Likewise, the multitasking is what we've come to expect from the most recent iterations of Android with very clear and smooth functionality, but Samsung's addition of split-screen applications also makes a welcome return and works brilliantly. As an aside, I rather like the fact that the screenshot capture has automatic sharing and editing features built-in to a pop-up. By default the Samsung UI has the traditional app drawer shortcut in the low bar switched off, which is kind of annoying, but it's easy enough to go into Settings and toggle it back on. It does, however, appear to be fixed in the lower right corner. The notifications drop down has all the best Android bells and whistles, whether in the homescreen or lock screen; that means full expandable notifications functionality, something still sorely missing from many other Android handsets and UI overlays. In the main homescreen mode it also has a full set of quick settings shortcuts with multiple swipable screens that are customisable. Because Samsung has added more and more functionality with every successive phone, the Galaxy S8's Settings menu is pretty vast, but this is undoubtedly one of the cleanest and tidiest Settings screens I've seen for some time with a white background, a sharp, thin font, and simple colour-coded icons with neat and succinct little summaries for each sub-menu. While many busy Settings screens, even some of Samsung's in the past, have made it very easy to get lost and confused, it's not really an issue here. On top of that, Samsung has added a bunch of prompts at the bottom of the menu screens where you can get help and guidance if you are struggling to find what you need. The Samsung UI is highly customisable via the use of themes, and Samsung has its own Theme store embedded inside Bixby, including static wallpapers alongside the animtated ones which move with your phone, like the default "Galaxy" one. However, at this stage some of the themes aren't optimised for the "Infinity Mode" of Samsung's new display, so they won't necessarily look their best. Right, now, let's talk about Bixby. Ahead of our review we had this notification from a Samsung spokesperson: "All Bixby functionality, bar Voice, will be available at launch. This includes Home, Reminder and Vision. Bixby Voice will be available in Korean and U.S English later this spring, and will expand to more languages globally over time." So in other words, here in the UK we don't have the Voice component of the Bixby assistant and we don't know when it will be added.  Bixby is continuously present and can be accessed either via the dedicated Bixby button or by swiping from the left of the homescreen. In its current state it's rather a lot like the old Samsung news feed but with an array of widgets and a few added extra bits for the reminders and calendar stuff. If you want voice control, however, you're going to have to resort to Google Assistant, which is already onboard and can be accessed via a long press of the Home key. Once set up it also works via the "OK Google," voice command. Bixby Vision is also usable, although it seems somewhat hit and miss. I tried getting the handset to recognise a couple of other phones I had lying around and it didn't really catch on. A copy of a Hellboy graphic novel did manage to get the phone to point me to several online shopping vendors where I could buy it, however. So far my only grumbles are as follows: The "EDGE" functionality is welcome, but does still feel a bit gimmicky. I like having the extra shortcuts overlay, but you don't really leverage the curvature of the screen to do this, it could just as easily come from another gesture swipe from the edge of a flat display. What's more, it only uses one side of the screen, the other one is dedicated to Bixby. Lastly on this subject, nothing is really displayed along the curved EDGE like the time or date or any of the app shortcuts. There doesn't appear to be that "bedside" functionality. Bixby, without voice, is kind of redundant. While this is undoubtedly the cleanest, most Android-y, and best optimised Samsung UI to date, there is still an element of Samsung stamping its stamp on things somewhat arbitrarily. I mean in the sense that so much of the UI is based around swishy fancy-pants gestures rather than straightforward control familiar to the average user. Even things like the default setup hiding the app drawer smacks of a Huawei-style move of reminding you you're on a brand device at the expense of making the UI as streamlined and accessible as possible, and this is something that plays out in a broader sense too. It's easily possible to whittle away these layers down to a much purer Android experience, so on the whole I like the Samsung UI, but to get there you have to know what you're doing, and not every buyer necessarily will, and may end up frustrated or not having the most optimised user experience for themselves. Samsung Galaxy S8+ Review: Verdict Having said the immediately above, those few bullet-pointed gripes at the end of the UI section are just about my only dislikes with the Galaxy S8+, and they are minor, somewhat nitpicky I'll readily admit, and oh so easily looked past in practice when using this phone on the daily. By now you may have gathered I'm rather fond of this phone. My overall impression is very positive. I liked using it, I found it easy and seamless, rather refreshing really. It feels thoughtful and clever, though one or two bits are still glaringly missing, we are promised they'll be patched in later. From a hardware perspective it's an absolute diamond. The camera is incredible and you really must try this, even if you've no intention of buying this phone I heartily encourage you to get down to a showroom and try the camera out if only to show you what's possible and what we should be expecting of future flagships as some kind of baseline. Meanwhile, on the display and processor front, Samsung continues to push boundaries and deliver excellent quality. And on the subject of design and build, well, it's a matter of taste but I think Samsung has gone from strength to strength and here has delivered something very refined indeed. The real icing on the cake, however, is that battery life. It's just phenomenal. This is easily the best phone on the market when it comes to battery life, so if you're looking for a handset that will go the distance - look no further.

Tweet: We're getting ready for our newest store in UAE by celebrating local artists and entrepreneurs. Excited for Apple Dubai Mall! The new store format will have spaces for classes and meetings, new screens and hardware, and "Genius groves," a tree-lined area where the "Genuis Bar" once was. In addition to traditional IT services, creative professionals like photographers will also be on-site, Ahrendts said. It comes as Apple's services business — including the app store, Apple Music and Apple Care — have become a faster-growing source of money than the flagship iPhone. Ahrendts said that critics of CEO Tim Cook who fixate on whether iPhone sales are slowing "probably don't really know the company that well." "Tim talks a lot on the earnings calls about the services business, and how rapidly that's growing," Ahrendts said. "And that's the part we haven't been able to unlock in store yet." Peter Foley | Bloomberg | Getty Images Angela Ahrendts The new educational programming at the stores will be called "Today at Apple," and is designed to put Apple Stores on the map as a meeting place for the next generation, akin to the coffee shops that have become de facto offices for many of today's creative professionals, Ahrendts said. While the idea of hanging out in a store may seem like supercharged capitalism, Ahrendts said Apple has always bridged the gap between selling products and creating communities. "I think we've always been this energy hub, if you will," Ahrendts said. "We are just empowering teams to take it further." "Today at Apple" will launch worldwide in May, with sessions in every store. Some stores, like the iconic "glass cube" location on Fifth Avenue in New York City, are set to make renovations that are by now well-documented. But others may change overnight, CBS said, a transformation Ahrendts compared with the leap between the iPod Nano and the iPhone 6. "The way we talk about it inside, is this is the largest product that Apple produces," Ahrendts said. show chapters Apple is one step closer to self-driving cars    Monday, 17 Apr 2017 | 1:36 PM ET | 01:32 Late co-founder Steve Jobs, who closely supervised the original Apple Store design, still has an influence in the new vision, Ahrendts said. "I think that anything you do at Apple you feel a tremendous onus. You want to carry on the legacy of what it meant ... the main objective. Our soul is our people, and our job is to enrich their lives — to change the world," she said. Ahrendts, who joined Apple in 2014 after serving as CEO of Burberry, said that while she told Cook she's "not a techie," she thinks that she was chosen for the post thanks to her leadership skills. "My dad used to say, 'I can teach you anything, but I can't teach you to feel and to care,'" Ahrendts said. "There's 7 billion people, it's not about you. ... When they open up and you're both open, you can dream and come up with incredible things together." The full interview is at CBSNews.com.

Home Macs | 20 Apr 2017 | Listen  | Print  | Comment (15) iLife and iWork Apps Now Free for Everyone by Josh Centers Once upon a time, Apple used to charge for nearly all its software, and especially productivity apps like the iLife and iWork suites. However, back in 2013, Apple made those apps free with the purchase of any new Mac or iOS device (see “New Free iLife and iWork Apps Share across Devices and Platforms,” 22 October 2013). Now, with no announcement or fanfare, Apple has made the current iLife and iWork apps entirely free for all users. Just to be clear, the change affects the following apps: GarageBand for macOS (requires 10.10 Yosemite) and iOS (requires iOS 10.2) iMovie for macOS (requires 10.11.2 El Capitan) and iOS (requires iOS 9.3) Keynote for macOS (requires 10.12 Sierra) and iOS (requires iOS 10) Numbers for macOS (requires 10.12 Sierra) and iOS (requires iOS 10) Pages for macOS (requires 10.12 Sierra) and iOS (requires iOS 10) This is good news for holdouts who haven’t purchased a new eligible Apple device since 2013 but are running a supported version of the operating system and would like copies of the iLife and iWork apps. And it makes explaining the pricing easier for Apple. Why didn’t Apple just make these apps free for everyone in the first place? The answer likely lies deep within Apple’s accounting department. Back in 2013, Apple made iLife, iWork, and OS X 10.9 Mavericks free and bundled them with every new Mac and iOS device sold. That move enabled the company to delay recognition of a portion of its sales receipts. That’s because the product (a Mac or iOS device) wasn’t “fully delivered” without updates to the software — it’s a “subscription accounting” approach. In its Q4 2013 financial quarter, Apple delayed recognition of $900 million in revenue, in essence hiding that money from the quarterly report (see “Apple Q4 2013 Results See Lower Profits Again,” 28 October 2013). That may answer the question of why Apple is now making these apps free for everyone. According to Daniel Eran Dilger of AppleInsider, the deferred revenue trickles back into Apple’s reported revenues over 2 years for iOS and 4 years for the Mac. It has been about 4 years since this deferral likely began, implying that Apple has finally cleaned the associated deferred revenue off its books. In the end, this change doesn’t mean much. Any effects from iLife and iWork becoming free — on competing apps, on Apple’s revenues, and on the perceived value of Apple hardware, for instance — have already taken place. Most people who want to use the iLife and iWork apps have likely either bought copies already or purchased new hardware since October 2013. We suspect that sales to owners of older Macs and iOS devices have dropped to the point where it was no longer worthwhile for Apple to bother charging for the apps anymore.

Apple has made its iLife and iWork apps free for all iOS and macOS users running supported versions of Apple’s operating systems. That’s great, but why now? Receive comments via RSS Add a comment Alfonso Scenna  2017-04-20 15:51 For people with older iOS devices, unless you are able to run iOS 10 you cannot download the now free apps. Reply Jim Schmidt  2017-04-24 12:32 Yep, I found that out last night. I went to download Pages on my iPad, and found out I couldn't because I don't have iOS 10 on it. I went to upgrade the OS... and found out my iPad is too old for 10. Sad. Reply Ian Orchard  2017-04-24 20:08 I've got the same problem with my beloved MacBookPro that is now deemed to be obsolete by Apple. I can't upgrade my current copies of iWork because it can't run Sierra. Now if only I could find a way to stop Pages & Numbers from nagging me to upgrade. Reply Jeffrey Puritz  2017-04-20 17:33 You're an optimist but my lengthy experience with Apple tells me that like Aperture these apps are in for a long slow death by neglect. Sadly, I think that this is true for the mac as well. Apple is only interested in the products with the most revenue and it shows. Reply William C Roberts  2017-04-25 09:27 I agree about "death from neglect". When apps become free, it means the developer, Apple, is no longer going to improve them. Eventually Apple will stop supporting them. Ultimately the apps will stop working. Reply Adam Engst   2017-04-25 09:49 But you have to remember that the entire point of making these apps — and the operating systems! — free was to add value to the hardware. Apple has never made significant money on software; the lion's share of the revenue has always come from hardware. As long as the software encourages hardware sales in a real way, it will keep getting attention. And, in fact, Aperture shows that charging money for an app makes no difference to Apple. My guess is that Apple will keep these apps going for a long time, but that users shouldn't expect the pace of development or innovation to compete with hungrier independent developers. Reply Frans Moquette  2017-04-20 18:15 Free may seem like a good thing, but nothing is really free. In this case we will be paying for these apps through hardware purchases, if we use an app or not. Then there is the question of app quality. Since Apple is not making any money off them anymore there is no stimulus to make these apps so good people will be willing to pay for them. The option to vote with our wallet has been taken from us. One sad example is the latest version of Numbers for iOS. The complaints and 1 star reviews are pouring in but Apple seems to be deaf and blind to them. Now that Numbers is free there is even less reason te expect Apple to do anything about this bad update. Reply Paul F Henegan   2017-04-21 03:55 No, they are not "free for everyone", only for those who have also upgraded to macOS X 12 or later. As Alfonso Scenna observes above, unless one is willing and able to run the very latest OS, there is no invitation to the party. Reply Adam Engst   2017-04-21 09:39 You're right that these apps have specific system requirements, and we've updated the article to make this completely clear. However, that doesn't change the fact that the apps are indeed free for everyone. Your ability to run an app is separate from its price. Reply Karen Kirtland  2017-04-24 19:55 The upgraded 5.2 version of Pages I tried using was terrible when compared with the older 4.0 versions. It functions too much like the awful Word program for me to use it. I wouldn't upgrade any of my perfectly functioning iWork programs, free or not, based on the extremely negative experience with Pages alone. Reply Phil Seymour  2017-04-24 21:15 They are free because the latest versions are crap compared to 09 versions. Thankfully I have kept the older versions of Pages, Keynote, Numbers, iMovie, GarageBand and iPhoto. I have the new versions, too, but if I have creative work to do, I use the older versions that were designed with uninterrupted creative workflow in mind. Reply Andrew Daws  2017-04-25 03:09 Anyone know how to get the iLife 11 version of iPhoto? I need it to open an old library Reply Jolin Warren  2017-04-25 07:14 There seem to be old copies available on eBay. You could possibly pick up a used one for a couple of dollars. http://www.ebay.co.uk/bhp/ilife-11 I also might have an old copy which I don't need anymore, but would have to check when I get home. Email me at tbcomment.2017.jolinwarren@xoxy.net if interested! Reply Jan van Es  2017-04-25 03:11 But what about people that are unable or unwilling to install the latest versions of MacOS? I cannot find any option to download (or buy) an older version of apps like Keynote, Pages, Numbers, etc. (Nor can I find any info about which version of those apps is compatible with which version of MacOS.) Reply Adam Engst   2017-04-25 09:44 There is a fair amount of information on Wikipedia about the versions. For instance: about Keynote: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynote_(presentation_software As much as it would be nice if Apple gave all old stuff away for free, or even kept old versions available for sale, I presume they've done the math and determined that it would be a significant expense that would benefit very few people because those who don't upgrade to new hardware tend not to buy (or even download) new software either. One of the basic corollaries of sticking with old hardware is that you shouldn't assume it will ever do things beyond what it could do when it stopped being supported. Macs stay functional for a long time, which is great, but they won't gain new capabilities (via new software) after a certain point, and they will start to lose functionality (through lack of compatibility with current software) after that.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Stumbleupon Whatsapp Email Unlike Windows and macOS users, most Linux users build their own computers and throw Linux on them. Despite its growing popularity, especially among system administrators and server buffs, Linux hasn’t entered mainstream computers. But you can buy computers with Linux pre-installed! While pre-built Linux machines are a rarity, they’re not completely non-existent. While installing a Linux operating system is easy, buying a purpose-built Linux PC provides perks such as guaranteed support, reliability, and an excellent out-of-the-box experience. This article covers some of the best Linux PCs available — and why you need one. Why Buy a Linux Desktop or Laptop?

Reasons to buy a Linux PC: Support options Excellent out-of-the-box experience Good for beginners to Linux and PC hardware Malware immunity Best Budget Linux Laptops System76 Lemur ($699) System76 is arguably the most well-known Linux PC manufacturer. Their hardware and software excel. Its entry-level Lemur might have a modest price point but it doesn’t skimp on features. The System76 Lemur boasts a 14.1-inch 1080p IPS display and a 7th generation Intel Kaby Lake processor; you can snag a Lemur with an i3 or i7. A thin and light laptop, the Lemur comes with either Ubuntu 16.04 LTS or Ubuntu 16.10. It’s available with Intel HD 620 graphics, up to 32 GB of RAM, and as high at 5 TB of storage. Wired allows that while the Lemur comes preloaded with Ubuntu, the hardware is compatible with a bevy of Linux operating systems including Fedora, Mint, and Debian. Furthermore, Wired praises System76 support. Jack Wallen over at TechRepublic commented on the small size and solid keyboard, as well as superb out of the box experience. The Linux Gamer, helping to correct the false notion that Linux gaming is an oxymoron, adds that leaving the F-row as F keys is great particularly for working in terminal apps. However, there’s no LED caps lock indicator. Moreover, the power adapter is a 90-degree angle. This tends to catch objects or occasionally obscure the HDMI port. Additionally, The Linux Gamer found that certain components like the trackpad have difficulty after putting the computer to sleep. But this is likely an Ubuntu issue, and not unique to the Lemur. You may also consider the thin and light ZaReason UltraLap 5330. Similarly specced and priced, the UltraLap 5330 offers more operating system choices including OpenSUSE and Cinnamon. With its superb battery life, light weight, and slim form factor, budget price, and premium specs, the System76 Lemur delivers the best price-to-performance ratio among Linux laptops. Pros 7th gen Intel i3-7100U or i7-7500U 14-inch 1080p IPS matte display Up to 32 GB RAM As high as 5 TB storage Excellent keyboard Great battery life Ubuntu 16.04 LTS or Ubuntu 16.10 Runs other distros well Cons Awkward charging cable No LED caps lock indicator Dell XPS 13 Developer Edition ($949) Image Credit: Dell Dude, you’re getting a Dell Linux laptop. Yes, Dell, the mainstream PC manufacturer makes a Linux version of its XPS 13. We reviewed the XPS 13 Dell XPS 13 2015 Review and Giveaway Dell XPS 13 2015 Review and Giveaway The XPS represents the pinnacle of laptop design in 2015, and it's the best bang for your buck out of any laptop we've ever seen in the $800 price range. Read More . Not surprisingly, the Developer Edition addendum to its name indicates the target audience. The XPS 13 sports Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and a 7th generation Intel processor. Image Credit: Pixabay Depending on the model, Dell’s XPS 13 comes outfitted with an i5-7200U or  i7-7500U. It comes in a small form factor with up to a 13-inch 3200 x 1800 “borderless” InfinityEdge touch display. Onboard you’ll find either an 8 GB RAM and 128 GB SSD combo on the i5 or 16 GB of RAM and a 512 GB SSD with the i7. Network World praised the i7 Dell XPS 13 Developer Edition. Notably, Network World found that while the XPS 13 ships with Ubuntu 16.04, most other distros run incredibly well. Reviewer Bryan Lunduke noted its ability to run openSUSE, Fedora, Elementary, and Debian. Stellar battery life, lots of ports, and an impressive screen resolution make the XPS 13 Developer Edition an excellent Linux laptop. Lunduke’s only minor quibble: the XPS 13 Developer Edition only comes preloaded with Ubuntu. However as Linux laptops are a rarity, it’s to be expected that distro choices remain limited. Pros Up to 3200 x 1800 resolution 13-inch screen Up to 16 GB RAM (i7) Up to 512 GB SSD (i7) Intel i5-7200U or i7-7500U Runs lots of Linux operating systems Cons Ships only with Ubuntu Best Mid-Range Linux Laptops ZaReason Verix 6440 ($1,500) Image Credit: ZaReason ZaReason’s Verix 6440 strikes a solid balance of performance and price. An i7-6700HQ comes standard as does an Nvidia 1060. What sets ZaReason apart is the customization of distros. You can select from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS,  Kubuntu 16.04 LTS, Mint, Fedora, Debian, and in some cases a custom Linux operating system. The Verix 6440 sports stellar specs positioning it as a desktop replacement laptop. However, while Linux operating system options vary, hardware specs are limited. Storage and RAM may be upgraded though. Compare that to the similarly priced System76 Oryx Pro. While the Oryx Pro is limited to Ubuntu only, you’ve got two CPU choices in the i7-7700HQ and 7820HK. Plus, it’s available with a 1060 or 1070 and starts slightly below the Verix 6440. Still, the ZaReason Verix 6440 is a great choice especially for those seeking more distro choices out-of-the-box. Pros Lots of Linux operating system options NVIDIA 10-series 1060 GPU Intel i7-6700HQ Desktop replacement laptop Cons Limited hardware options Purism Librem 15 ($1,700) As a Linux PC manufacturer, Purism is unique for that reason alone. But it’s the software that’s truly revolutionary, although controversial. The Purism Librem 15 is mid-sized and mid-range priced powerful laptop. Purism values security, freedom, and privacy. Hence the root word of “pure” in the company name. The Librem 15 arrives with a fifth gen Intel i7-5557U, up to 32 GB of DDR3 RAM, and Intel Iris graphics 6100. Image Credit: Purism Endgadget appreciated the open-source software and freedom. The operating system is a Trisquel variation. However, there’s definitely a premium. The base model includes a paltry 4 GB of RAM and a 500 GB hard drive. Graphics are integrated, not discrete, and the i7 is a dual core processor. Moreover, Purism caused controversy with its laptops. Image Credit: Purism According to a PC World article, the Librem 15 contradicts its open-source promises with proprietary BIOS. Ultimately if your priorities are free and open software, Purism is your best bet. But for the price, you can snag the XPS 13, a Verix 6440, or System76 Serval WS. Check out Jacob Kauffmann’s, AKA Nerd on the Street, detailed Serval WS review. Each boasts drastically better performance than the Librem. Pros Extremely free and open Security-oriented Intel Iris graphics i7-5557U Cons Dual core i7 High price for low specs Proprietary BIOS Poor price-to-performance ratio Best High-End Linux Laptops ZaReason Chimera 3 ($2,048) Image Credit: ZaReason ZaReason’s Chimera 3 is a good workstation-class laptop. It includes a quad-core i7-6820HK paired with a GTX 980M for powerful graphics and computing power. Standard, you’ll find a 500 GB 5400 RPM hard drive and 4 GB of DDR4 RAM. Once again, the Chimera 3 dominates on distro choice. Out-of-the-box options include Ubuntu 16.04, Mint 18, and Kubuntu 16.04. It’s a well-specced laptop with options ranging up to 32 GB of RAM. On top of that, there’s a standard DVD drive — which is a nice touch considering the rarity of optical drives in laptops.   However, the base model comes with a mere 500 GB of storage and 4 GB of RAM. Considering the target audience (power users), the entry level price over $2,000 seems steep. The CPU and GPU, while undoubtedly powerful, are last generation Intel and Nvidia offerings. However, the Chimera 3 features a mini DisplayPort in addition to an HDMI out. If you need those ports, the Chimera 3 should meet your needs. Pros Sixth generation Intel i7-6820HK quad-core processor GTX 980M GPU Lots of distribution options Standard optical drive HDMI and DisplayPort Cons Small, slow hard drive as standard Paltry 4 GB RAM as standard Last generation CPU and GPU System76 Bonobo WS ($2,799) The System76 Bonobo WS earns its “workstation” classification. You can look at hardware specs all day, but real-world applications offer the best insight. Canonical’s Jorge Castro tested the Bonobo WS’s fortitude with a 32 node Kubernetes cluster. The Bonobo barely broke a sweat. While its 16 GB of RAM eventually acted as a bottleneck, the Bonobo comes with up to 64 GB of RAM. On the hardware side, the Bonobo packs a 17.3-inch 1080p screen or 4K HiDPI matte display. Processing power comes via 7th gen Intel i7 desktop processors and up to two 10-series Nvidia GPUs. There’s an available 5 TB of storage. Premium features like a multi-color backlit keyboard further classify the Bonobo as a beastly laptop. Image Credit: System76 It’s tough to find many faults with the System76 Bonobo WS. The Bobobo WS is equally as heavy as it is powerful. It’s a desktop replacement down to its large footprint and impressive girth. Chances are if you’re in the market for a Bonobo WS, you won’t mind the extra pounds. Image Credit: System76 Additionally, it’s not cheap. Yet even the lowest configuration of a Bonobo WS trounces the Chimera 3. System76 also makes the Serval WS which retains 7th gen Intel CPUs and GTX 10-series graphics. Its starting point, however, is $1,899 making it a viable alternative that’s cheaper and more powerful than the Chimera 3. An i7-6700 and NVIDIA 1070 are standard. Plus, there’s one HDMI 2.0 and two mini DisplayPort 1.3 ports. The Bonobo WS might carry a hefty price tag, but it’s certainly worth the money. Pros Up to 64 GB RAM NVIDIA 10-series GPUs (available with two) Desktop 7th gen Intel i7 CPUs One HDMI and two mini DisplayPort outputs True desktop replacement Cons Heavy Not cheap, but great laptop for the price Best Budget Linux Desktops ZaReason Limbo 560 ($650) Image Credit: ZaReason The Limbo 560 is one of the most customizable Linux desktops available. As with other ZaReason PCs, there are several distro choices. But hardware is really where the Limbo shines. The base model comes with an i5-6400, and integrated graphics. Upgrades include as high as an i7-6700k and a Titan X Pascal GPU. For users who want a lot of options, the Limbo 560 delivers. Unfortunately, the Limbo’s base model is pretty underpowered. The power supply is a mere 350 watts which should be sufficient for integrated graphics. If you tack on a dedicated GPU, especially the $1,500 alone Titan X, you’ll need to swap that for a better PSU. Additionally, there’s no optical drive standard and the entry-level model only has a mere 4 GB of RAM and 500 GB hard drive. ZaReason’s Mediabox 565 is a solid alternative. Pros Highly customizable hardware Lots of distro choices Up to Titan X GPU As high as an i7 Cons Low entry system specs System76 Meerkat ($499) The System76 Meerkat is a pretty neat device. It’s an Intel NUC but includes Ubuntu standard. The Meerkat includes a 6th gen Intel i3 or i5 for the CPU, and up to 2.5 TB of storage space. This tiny PC is energy efficient and space-saving. A small footprint and low power consumption make the Meerkat an excellent choice for an HTPC, media server, or HTPC-media server combo. An avid Plex user, I ranked the Meerkat among the best Plex server devices available. Yet the Meerkat isn’t as upgradeable as a traditional desktop. You’re stuck with integrated graphics and you can’t upgrade the CPU. RAM and harddrive upgrades are totally feasible, but that’s about it. Additionally, you’ll probably want to future proof and go with the i5. Nevertheless, the Meerkat is a great, affordable, energy efficient budget Linux PC. Pros Small footprint Energy efficient Up to 2.5 TB hard drive space 6th gen Intel i3 or i5 Cons Can’t upgrade GPU or CPU Only available with integrated graphics i3 not as future proof as i5 version Best Mid-Range Linux Desktops LAC Portland Lenovo ThinkStation P310 Image Credit: Lenovo LAC Portland Lenovo ThinkStation P310 is an excellent midrange desktop. Although the ThinkStation is technically a workstation or server, it’s a mid-tower desktop. The P310 boasts a beefy Xeon E3-1245 v5, 8 GB of DDR4 RAM, and a 1 TB 7200 rpm harddrive. There’s lots of room for expansion inside the case. Plus, for distro fiends, the P310 is available with a smattering of Linux operating systems. In addition to the newest Ubuntu releases, it’s available with Ubuntu 12.04 and 14.04, several flavors of Fedora, Debian, and OpenSUSE. LAC Portland’s array of devices comes with a three-year on-site warranty at no charge. But that doesn’t quite help those who aren’t nearby. Additionally, the starting price only includes 8 GB of RAM and a 1 TB harddrive. The Xeon is a very capable CPU, but there aren’t upgrade options for the CPU or for a dedicated GPU. Still, these are user upgradeable. The entry price just below $1,000 is good, but not great. However excellent hardware that’s compatible with a range of distros and a CPU that offers maximum reliability makes the ThinkStation a solid mid-range Linux desktop. Pros Xeon E3-1245 v5 CPU Up to 64 GB RAM Lots of distros including unstable and older releases Good onsite support User upgradeable Cons Three-year warranty is onsite only No GPU or CPU upgrade options Maingear Drift ($1,099) Steam Machines were the brainchild of Valve. Unfortunately, these didn’t quite take off and have yet to replace console gaming. That’s largely because of strong, but not widespread, Linux gaming support. Steam Machines run a Debian-based custom distro, SteamOS. It’s not a perfect operating system, but if you’re into Linux and gaming, the Maingear Drift is one of the best mid-range PCs you can get. Image Credit: Maingear While the Maingear Drift is well equipped on the hardware front, SteamOS is rather limited. There’s no file manager or image viewer. There’s some streaming support in the browser, and you can playback local music. But overall it’s a PC built for gamers. If you’re a Linux gamer, the Maingear Drift is arguably the best Steam Machine available. The Alienware Alpha is a good alternative. However, the Alpha is limited in its upgradeability. Similarly, the Zotac Zbox Steam Machine features a GTX 960 and SteamOS but you can’t upgrade the GPU or CPU. Image Credit: Dell PC Mag awarded the Maingear Drift a 3.5 out of 5 in its review. In its review, PC Mag liked the RAID storage, small footprint, and 4K gaming capabilities. However, they also noted that it’s not the fastest running 1080p resolutions. Additionally, opting for the Titan X really drives up the price. Pros Small form factor VR-ready i7 CPU Up to 6 TB hard drive space As high as 16 GB DDR4 RAM Available with a Titan X Cons 1080p gaming isn’t the fastest Titan X costs a major premium Best High-End Linux Desktops System76 Silverback WS ($2,199) The Silverback WS is a workstation class desktop. With a just over $2,000 starting point, even the base model comes well-equipped. Inside you’ll find dual Xeon E5 v4 CPIs, up to 1 TB of ECC RAM, and as high as 64 TB of storage space. For GPUs, the Silverback offers NVIDIA 10-series GTX cards, Tesla, or Quadro configurations. Plus, there’s an option for an independent PCIe NVMe Ubuntu install. Image Credit: System76 I had the pleasure of viewing the internals of the Silverback WS and was truly impressed. The whopping nine hard drive bays sent me into a daydream about setting up an array of hard drives in RAID and how many concurrent transcodes the dual Xeons could handle. But the Silverback is suited to much more than just a media server. It’s beefy enough for tasks like machine learning. In short, if you want a top-tier desktop, look no further than the Silverback WS. On that note, the Silverback WS is a bit overkill for the average user. Additionally, the ECC RAM sports better reliability than traditional RAM. It’s also more expensive. Therefore if you plan to upgrade later, you’ll pay extra for the ECC However if you’ve got the cash to shell out, it’s an amazing workstation. Chances are if you’re dropping over 2K on a machine, you actually need the horsepower. The P410 30B3 from LAC Portland clocks in at just over 1K and features a Xeon v4 CPU. Granted, it’s got less computing power and the sticker price reflects that. Pros Dual Xeon E5 v4 CPUs Choies oc GTX 10-series, Quadro, and Tesla GPUs Up to 1 TB ECC RAM As high as 64 TB or storage space. Cons Only Ubuntu available ECC RAM is pricey Expensive system albeit well equipped Puget Obsidian ($1,959) Image Credit: Puget Systems Puget Systems has a pleasant selection of Linux capable PCs. The Obsidian’s standard build uses an Intel E3 v5 Xeon processor, 16 GB of DDR4 ECC RAM, Intel P530 integrated graphics and your choice of Linux distro. You can snag an Obsidian with CentOS, Mint, or Ubuntu. The Obsidian is truly an excellent device and arrives pretty decked out even in its stock. Image Credit: Puget Systems The only minor quibbles I can think of are that it’s pretty pricey at almost 2K. Again, it’s got ECC RAM which while more reliable is more expensive. Still, Puget’s Obsidian is a beast of a high-end desktop/server class Linux PC. Pros Xeon E3 v5 CPU Up to 64 GB ECC RAM GTX, Titan, and Quadro GPUs available Several distros available Cons ECC RAM is pricey Final Thoughts and Alternatives Although these are the best Linux laptops and desktops available across an array of budgets, there are plenty of other options. ZDNet features a stellar write up on five Linux desktop vendors. Eight Virtues Among these, Eight Virtues provides a hybrid pre-built and do-it-yourself option. Rather than pre-selected systems, you choose the parts and distro on your own. Choices though are admittedly limited. You’re relegated to a handful of AMD CPUs and NVIDIA GPUs. Price goes up a lot. An AMD FX-8350 powered PC with a GTX 750, 1 TB hard drive, and 16 GB of DDR3 retails for almost $900 as per adding items to my cart. Image Credit: Eight Virtues Emperor Linux Image Credit: Emperor Linux Emperor Linux sells a lineup of high-end PCs. Mostly you’ll find Dell and Lenovo machines. There are custom versions of Linux based on the likes of Ubuntu, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, SUSE, openSUSE, Fedora, Debian, and Slackware. Moreover, older iterations are available. Prices are a bit high for the hardware, but you’re getting a quality device with lots of operating system options. ThinkPenguin ThinkPengiun provides Linux laptop and desktops. But while they offer some of the lowest prices, the hardware is a bit budget. For basic tasks like internet browsing and streaming, these are likely fine, however.

Roosevelt was inaugurated in 1933, his 100-day vision was said to have been met with a crowd "as silent as a group of mourners around a grave." More than 80 years later, a similar shroud of muted pessimism has fallen over Silicon Valley, as leaders stifle their vitriolic opposition to President Donald Trump. And yet most technology CEOs have quietly managed to walk the line between ideological defiance and tacit cooperation over the first 100 days of Trump's presidency — to great success. In fact, the tech-heavy Nasdaq on Tuesday crossed the 6,000 mark for the first time ever. In contrast to the struggling farmers of 1930s California, today's Silicon Valley is the land of $400 juicers and on-demand massage. Indeed, the technology sector has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the Trump presidency: The S&P information technology group has risen more than 14 percent this year, more than banks, utilities, health firms, energy companies or consumer brands. It's up more than 10 percent since the inauguration. Trump takes office, a rally boosts tech Despite loud opposition from tech firms to many of Trump's policies, investors have hoisted many tech stocks to all-time highs since the election. Shares of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Alphabet have hit one all-time high after another in 2017. The Nasdaq 100 has hit higher levels than ever, and the IPO market hit a seven-quarter high in terms of capital raised, according to Renaissance Capital. To be sure, many trends have been at play — a holiday shopping season that favored online retailers and advertisers, some better-than-expected earnings reports, and broad market gains. Consumer sentiment popped after the election, as it becomes "more difficult to disentangle political fervor from what appears to be a growing sense among consumers that the economy will experience fundamental changes," according to Richard Curtin, an economist at the University of Michigan. But by the end of last week, Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook accounted for the bulk of the gains in the S&P 500. Analysts also believe that tech companies are likely to be some of the top beneficiaries of Trump's proposed policies, especially tax reform. Cisco is likely to be a top beneficiary of lowered taxes on the repatriation of foreign cash, according to research from Strategas Research Partners. Apple could also be a winner, according to Baird's Will Power. Tech angst swirled around Trump ... All this is surprising because prior to Inauguration Day, Silicon Valley made no secret of its distaste for Trump, criticizing his policies on immigration and equal rights for women and the LGBTQ community, as well as his rhetoric on trade. Box CEO Aaron Levie declared Trump "the scariest person in America," "obviously unelectable," and compared Trump's debate performances to "someone who's drunk at trivia night at a bar." Conservative HP boss Meg Whitman defied her political party to call Trump a demagogue that "undermined the fabric of our national character." The discontent filtered up to the ranks of the world's richest and most powerful companies. Amazon's Jeff Bezos said Trump's behavior "erodes our democracy around the edges" and joked he'd like to "send Donald to space." Anti-Trump protesters gathered at the headquarters of Google and Uber. Apple, Airbnb, Facebook, Intel and others filed a legal brief opposing a since-blocked executive order banning U.S. entry for refugees and citizens from certain Muslim-majority countries. Executives who broke from tech's bastion of opposition faced immense scrutiny. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich was forced to scrap a Trump fundraiser in the 11th hour. Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Y Combinator's Sam Altman fielded calls to boot Trump-ally Peter Thiel from their boards. Uber's Travis Kalanick chose to leave Trump's business advisory council after it was "misinterpreted" as an endorsement of the president — and an Oracle employee publicly resigned when CEO Safra Catz failed to follow suit. ... but then CEOs walked it back Timothy A. Clary | AFP | Getty Images (L-R) Amazon's chief Jeff Bezos, Larry Page of Alphabet, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg , Vice President-elect Mike Pence and President-elect Donald Trump attend a meeting at Trump Tower December 14, 2016 in New York. Perhaps unsurprisingly, tech CEOs have softly warmed to Trump amid the stock market bounce. Levie told CNBC he wanted to bridge the divide with the new administration. Whitman has also committed to give Trump "the benefit of the doubt." Bezos tweeted that he wishes Trump "great success." And Amazon has made 10 job-related announcements in the five months since the election — versus nine in the entire year prior to the election. Like Bezos, many of Trump's harshest critics in tech touted American job creation, trotting tail between legs to the White House and currying favor with the administration, sometimes to the chagrin of their employees. Despite opposition to Trump's travel ban, Krzanich took to the Oval Office to promote his creation of 10,000 new jobs — even though it was first announced during the Obama administration. Salesforce's Marc Benioff — who openly backed Trump's opponent Hillary Clinton — told Trump that he hoped to create 2 million jobs, perhaps more "if we all came together and unified to create a great program with your leadership." More meetings have happened behind closed doors, with Apple's Tim Cook, Microsoft founder Bill Gates and Tesla boss Elon Musk joining the administration's new White House Office of American Innovation. Others in tech have silently squirreled away their winnings, staying out of the political limelight. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey spoke out about the travel ban but has since demurred from commenting on the president's tweeting. Zuckerberg, lambasted over whether "fake news" on social media swayed the election, managed to pen a 6,000-word salvo on society without singling out Trump. show chapters Should you still bet on big tech, post-earnings?    Friday, 21 Apr 2017 | 5:30 PM ET | 06:10 Arguably, money speaks louder than words — technology companies have spent more on lobbying than ever under the new administration, according to documents compiled by BuzzFeed News. Still, critics of the industry are beginning to demand that CEOs put more on the line. Ellen Pao, a former venture capitalist and CEO who has been vocal about workplace equality, has called on Dorsey and Y Combinator's Altman to take action. The disconnect between Trump voters and "coastal elite" technology companies has highlighted that for all their election-season bluster, the industry has plenty of work to do on diversity, gender equity, and poverty within its own ranks. Veteran tech journalist Kara Swisher called the CEOs "sheeple," participating in "behind-the-scenes jockeying for what they really want." Tech investor Chris Sacca told Swisher that the CEOs were being "used to legitimize a fascist." "CEOs should remember that their employees look up to them, and if they feel like their employer is not going to speak up and represent their interests — whether it's transgender issues, women's rights issues, the environment, immigration — I think it's a missed opportunity," venture capitalist Bijan Sabet told Swisher. "I think [this election] was a wake-up call." Correction: This story was revised to correct the spelling of Sam Altman's last name.

"Carpool Karaoke" will be available on Apple Music and stars comedian James Corden. Arjun Kharpal | @ArjunKharpal 18 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES Apple has delayed the launch of its first ever original video series "Carpool Karaoke" with comedian James Corden, the company said on Tuesday, marking a setback as it looks to boost its content efforts. In February this year, Apple's head of internet and software services Eddy Cue, said at the Code Media conference that "Carpool Karaoke" would debut on Apple Music in April. But it doesn't seem like this is now the case. "'Carpool Karaoke' for Apple Music will premiere later this year," an Apple spokesperson told CNBC by email, without giving an explanation. CBS | Getty Images Former First Lady Michelle Obama joins James Corden for Carpool Karaoke on 'The Late Late Show with James Corden,' Wednesday, July 20th 2016. Reuters reported that the premiere party for the show was scheduled in March in Los Angeles but was postponed days before it was set to take place. Apple delayed the party again this week and it is now scheduled for Monday. "Carpool Karaoke" sees Corden sitting in a car with a celebrity and singing along to songs. Past guests include Bruno Mars, Madonna and former First Lady Michelle Obama. The delay to the show comes as Apple tries to push forward in the realm of original content, potentially pitting it against the likes of Netflix and Amazon. It's something that Chief Executive Tim Cook has talked up. "In terms of original content, we have put our toe in the water doing some original content for Apple Music, and that will be rolling out through the year. We are learning from that, and we'll go from there," Cook said on a recent earnings call. In January, the Wall Street Journal reported that the company is planning to build a significant new business in original TV shows and movies. The technology giant has already announced plans for a reality show called "Planet of the Apps". "Carpool Karaoke" will be on Apple Music, the firm's music streaming service. Original shows are seen as a way to boost subscriber numbers for the $9.99 a month service. Apple Music has 20 million paying subscribers, but trails behind Spotify which has 50 million, according to official numbers. Apple analysts have flagged up services such as Apple Music as key for the iPhone maker to continue strong growth in the future .

If your new product or service isn’t gaining traction, ask yourself “What’s my California Roll?” How would you get him to try sushi for the first time? I’ll admit, the bento box is an unlikely place to learn an important business lesson. But consider the California Roll — Understanding the impact of this icon of Japanese dining can make all the difference between the success or failure of your product. If you’ve ever felt the frustration of customers not biting, then you can sympathize with Japanese restaurant owners in America during the 1970s. Sushi consumption was all but non-existent. By all accounts, Americans were scared of the stuff. Eating raw fish was an aberration and to most, tofu and seaweed were punch lines, not food. Then came the California Roll. While the origin of the famous maki is still contested, its impact is undeniable. The California Roll was made in the USA by combining familiar ingredients in a new way. Rice, avocado, cucumber, sesame seeds, and crab meat — the only ingredient unfamiliar to the average American palate was the barely visible sliver of nori seaweed holding it all together. Familiar Done Differently The California Roll provided a gateway to discover Japanese cuisine and demand exploded. Over the next few decades sushi restaurants, which were once confined to large coastal cities and almost exclusively served Japanese clientele, suddenly went mainstream. Today, sushi is served, not only in the large coastal cities, but also in small rural towns, airports, strip malls, and stocked in the deli section of local supermarkets. Americans now consume $2.25 billion of sushi annually. The California Roll was sushi’s gateway into millions of American mouths. The lesson of the California Roll is simple — people don’t want something truly new, they want the familiar done differently. Interestingly, this lesson applies just as much to the spread of innovation as it does to tastes in food. For example, the graphical user interface, a milestone in the popularization of the personal computer, used familiar visual metaphors like folders, notepads, windows, and trash cans to appeal to mainstream users terrified by the command-line interface (perhaps even more than the thought of eating raw fish). The computer underneath was the same, however the familiar veneer suddenly made it accessible. Apple’s early skeuomorphic design was the California Roll of the personal computer.Quaint but unnecessary representations of the familiar became a hallmark of Apple products. As Claire Evans wrote for Motherboard, “While under the direction of the late Steve Jobs, Apple’s design aesthetic tended heavily towards the skeuomorphic. The Apple desktop calendar, famously, is rendered with accents of rich Corinthian leather; its bookshelves gleam with wood veneers, its chrome always brushed, its pages stitched and torn, its tabletop felt green.” Now that Apple serves a generation familiar with how its products work, it can shepherd them from California Rolls to sashimi, so to speak. “We understood that people had already become comfortable with touching glass,” explained Apple’s Jony Ive. “They didn’t need physical buttons, they understood the benefits.” Mini credit cards are Apple’s California Roll for mobile payment. However, Apple still uses its tried and true methods whenever the company wants users to adopt a new behavior. For example, the rebranded Apple Wallet helps users feel comfortable with the technology by making payment options look just like mini credit cards. Even though there’s no technical reason to do so, Apple understands the power of the familiar. (Un)Familiarity Breeds Contempt As I wrote about in my book, Hooked, unfamiliar products and interfaces are more difficult to use and can impede adoption. Several psychological phenomena conspire to make us resist the atypical. According to BJ Fogg of Stanford’s Persuasive Technology Lab, “non-routine” is one of six “Elements of Simplicity” — the factors that affect the likelihood of any particular human action occurring. Fogg wrote When people face a behavior that is not routine, then they may not find it simple. In seeking simplicity, people will often stick to their routine, like buying gas at the same station, even if it costs more money or time than other options. Of course, we also have a love for “new and improved” but in relatively modest proportions. “New and improved” is great for things we are already familiar with — like cereal and dish soap — but not for products where we lack a frame of reference. Unfortunately, our aversion to things that are outside the norm is particularly hard on companies producing radical innovation — no matter how beneficial they may be. If using a new product does not feel familiar, it faces severe challenges. According Fogg, “People are generally resistant to teaching and training because it requires effort. This clashes with the natural wiring of human adults: We are fundamentally lazy. As a result, products that require people to learn new things routinely fail.” What’s Your California Roll? When describing the Apple Watch, Jony Ive said his goal was to build “the strangely familiar.” The smart watch is exactly the kind of innovation that is still too new for all but the most early of early adopters. And yet Ive obsessed over the details of the Digital Crown, an esthetic adopted from traditional watchmaking. Clearly, Ive knows what he’s doing — industry analysts expect the company to sell 19 million units this year. As the pace of innovation accelerates, human behavior, not technological restraints, will be the deciding factor of whether products are adopted or discarded. If new products and services are to positively impact our lives, they must find a gateway into our daily routines. The familiar done differently is the way to users’ minds and hearts — and sometimes their stomachs. Here’s the gist: The California Roll introduced Americans to sushi by using familiar ingredients arranged in a new way. The California Roll Rule: People don’t want something truly new, they want the familiar done differently. Things that are truly new need to use familiar mental models to gain user adoptions (i.e., Apple’s use of skeuomorphs.) Unfamiliar interfaces are more difficult to use and impede adoption. If your new product or service is not engaging users, ask “What’s my California Roll?” What do you think? What was your familiar gateway into a new technology or product? Can you think of other companies who have used the “California Roll Rule” to introduce new products in a familiar way? Tell me what you think in the comment section below.

In fact, Tim Cook’s company is said to have abandoned the “s” upgrades to focus solely on two next-generation handsets that will be launched as iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus.  This Tuesday, Chinese tech blog Micgadget.com stated that new information from Apple supply chain Foxconn is saying that there are only two new iPhone models in the works. The blog learned from insiders that the Cupertino giant is not going to debut three iPhone models as previously rumored. Instead, there would only be two 2017 models that will be unveiled as 10th anniversary handsets.  The Chinese site’s sources also claimed that Foxconn will receive the materials it needs to assemble the phones in the last week of June. Not only that, there is mention of display-embedded Touch ID sensors and the inclusion of dual cameras in both the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus.  READ: Will iPhone 8 sport better display than Galaxy S8?  However, MacRumors says Microgadget.com’s report is questionable since it’s unusual for supply chain insider information to go against what’s already been established by leaks at this point when production is about to start. Furthermore, the blog itself does not have a solid track record for outing accurate details on Apple’s activities.  In March of this year, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo stated that the tech giant is releasing three iPhones: a 4.7-inch model, another with 5.5-inch LCD display and a flagship device that will sport OLED display. This has since been the basis of many other reports from various tech sites, especially when other leaks point to the same idea.  Should Apple really go with releasing an iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus this September, it means the company is ditching its usual “s” upgrades this year. It also means Apple will follow Samsung’s footsteps in debuting only two flagship phones just like what the latter did when it unveiled the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ during its Unpacked event in late March.  Apple is reportedly releasing only two iPhones this year.

'Fate of the Furious' Stays on Top; 'Unforgettable,' 'The Promise' Bomb "The Fate of the Furious" is racing to defend its title at the top of the box office, while a number of new releases including "The Promise" and "Unforgettable" are being left in the dust. Universal's eighth installment in the Fast and Furious franchise proved to be a global box office titan when it opened last weekend to a record-shattering $532.5 million. This time around looks to tell mostly the same story -- while domestic grosses slipped 61% from its first to second weekend, the movie is still easily topping the box office with $38.7 million from 4,329 locations.

But is there a need to panic? By: FE Online | Published: April 25, 2017 6:25 PM Apple iPhone bug: Users will have to use three fingers in order to activate the bug, and it may work only after a few attempts. (Image: Reuters) Users of Apple iPhones with the new OS should beware now. A new bug has been reported in iOS devices, and it can freeze the iOS devices in just three clicks and the user will be forced to restart the phone in order to use it again. The bug would not have been a big issue if not uncovered, yet it is a problem nonetheless. If you follow the exact set of steps, you can freeze your iPhone. According to a 9to5Mac report, the bug affects all iOS devices running iOS 10.2 and above. The report added that the latest iOS 10.3.2 beta has not fixed the bug either, while there may be other devices too which might get affected by the ‘bug’. The new ‘bug’ in iOS devices can be seen in a YouTube video too. The bug was first spotted by AmiciApple. To find out what the bug is, open the Control Panel on your iOS device, and click on three continuous rows at the same time. Users will have to use three fingers in order to activate the bug, and it may work only after a few attempts. The bug, when tried, has reportedly made most of the new iPhones out there get frozen. But there is no need to panic yet, as it does not really cause any more problems. This is not an issue which will affect you all the time, but someone might play a prank on you. You can either restart/respring the iPhone of it may get restarted/rebooted automatically, but it is advisable to not try the bug as it might affect the phone in a way we don’t know yet. If you want to, check out how to freeze the Apple iPhone here: It is not a severe problem in your iPhone, yet isn’t it intriguing to know how such occurrences happen? As you can check in the video, it is understandable that the issue might not crop up automatically unless someone tells you the process. It won’t even happen accidentally. New operating systems are bound to have some bugs when launched but those go away in time. According to earlier reports, once a text doing the rounds in iPhones of the world caused them to crash. Something similar yet less effective came to light this year too, according to 9to5Mac. It is unclear whether Apple will address this small issue in any way. No Comments.

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish New Rumor Suggests Only Two iPhones Will Be Launched This Year By Tyler Lee on 04/25/2017 05:09 PDT According to the rumors, one of the popular consensus is that Apple will release three iPhones this year: the iPhone 7s, iPhone 7s Plus, and the iPhone 8 (or iPhone Edition). However according to a new report from Micgadget (via MacRumors), they are now claiming that Apple will only launch two iPhones this year. The report reads, “Some our friends from Foxconn confirmed that Foxconn received an order for two new models. It’s mean that Apple will be released two, not three models.” They add, “But rumors say that Apple will be released two iPhone 7S and one iPhone 8 (or iPhone Edition) models. Today we can tell you , that it’s not true. In this fall we can see only two models with new technology.” Now this isn’t to say that they are wrong and that the previous rumors are right. After all these are all rumors for now, but as MacRumors points out, Micgadget doesn’t exactly have the most stellar track record when it comes to Apple rumors. Not to mention the report goes against more reputable sources like KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo and also Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. In any case these are all rumors for now so they’re still best taken with a grain of salt, but what do you guys think? Could Apple stick to launching only two iPhones this year, or do you agree with the earlier rumors that we can expect to see three new models? Filed in Apple >Cellphones >Rumors.

Apple is working on a sensor that would monitor diabetics' blood sugar levels, according to CNBC. It's been in the works since the days of Steve Jobs, who reportedly envisioned a wearable like Apple Watch that would keep tabs on people's health. This story is of great personal interest to me since I have been a type 2 diabetic for over 25 years. I have worked hard to keep my A1C numbers in check, a measurement that determines blood sugar numbers over a three-month period. Non-diabetics have A1C numbers well under 5.0 and, as a diabetic, my safe numbers must be kept in the 6.0-7.0 range. Apple would not be the first to deliver a monitoring solution for diabetics. I have used Dexcom's Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) for over a year now, for example, and it has changed the management of my diabetes for the better. A sensor on my stomach uses two small, hair-like wires that get blood sugar readings from an interstitial fluid just below the skin every five minutes. Related Kids' Screen Time Linked to Diabetes Kids' Screen Time Linked to Diabetes When I first started using it, the accuracy rate was within 5 to 15 percent of actual glucose readings. But in the last year, Dexcom has tweaked the software, and now my readings are within four or five points of what I would get if I did a pinprick reading via some type of external blood-testing kit. Sometimes my readings are even identical to the pinprick numbers, showing that Dexcom has made major strides in delivering accurate readings. I can keep tabs on my numbers via the Dexcom app; readings are sent via a wireless Bluetooth transmitter that sits on top of the sensor. To get my current blood sugar reading, I just glance at my watch. Dexcom's approach is called an invasive CGM because it has tiny needles that prick the patient's stomach. In fact, many other CGM devices being considered for approval by the FDA are still invasive. However, there is much work being done to try to get these blood sugar readings via light pulses or sensors on a wrist band or watch. It's very hard to do, and I have not yet seen tech that's even close to being in a place for the FDA to approve. CNBC suggests that's what Apple is working on, but that is highly speculative. The only downside is cost. If a person were to pay for this solution out of pocket, the sensors cost $300 a month and a transmitter that lasts three months costs $250. Thankfully, in my case, insurance covers 50 percent of this cost, but even that is still pricey for me and many who have proper medical insurance. If Apple tackles this area, a real breakthrough would be an affordable, non-invasive, and accurate solution. Back to top Previous : Apps Are Nice, But Silicon Valley Should Focus on Health Moo...

Apple has reportedly roped in a specialist from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for its augmented reality (AR) programmes. The iPhone-maker has hired Jeff Norris, who founded the Mission Operations Innovation Office of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. At NASA, Norris was responsible for finding new methods to control spacecraft and robots in space by using virtual and augmented reality, according to his personal website. Earlier this year, he joined Apple as a senior manager of the company’s augmented reality team, which is led by former Dolby Labs executive Mike Rockwell, the publication reported. Currently, the team is involved in developing AR glasses and related features for upcoming versions of the iPhone. Working for NASA projects, Norris delivered headsets to scientists on the ground to enable them to experience live views of Mars. His duties at the space agency also included giving Microsoft’s HoloLens headsets to astronauts living in the International Space Station. After joining NASA in 1999, Norris worked on the development of a new software programme to control Mars exploration rovers from the ground. In November last year, Apple was said to be considering an expansion of its wearable portfolio with the inclusion of AR glass headsets. For this, the tech giant had reportedly held discussions with potential suppliers. The device, which was still in an exploration phase, would connect wirelessly to iPhones, show images along with other data in the wearer’s field of vision, and could use augmented reality. The report said the company ordered a small number of near-eye displays for testing but it did not obtain required components for larger scale production. Apple is expected to introduce the product in 2018 at the earliest. Last year, Apple CEO Tim Cook that the company would continue to make investments in AR technology, as it struggled with slowing sales of the iPhone. Tags Apple AR NASA Previous ArticleIt’s Tax Time!

While the Galaxy S8 is the hottest new mobile device, there are reasons IT will want to stick with the iPhone 7 Plus. Sarah K. White (CIO (US)) 25 April, 2017 20:54 - - - - print email Comments The Samsung Galaxy S8 is an impressive smartphone thanks to its high-end design and Super AMOLED Infinity Display. But, while the S8 does a lot of things better than the iPhone 7 Plus, there are still plenty of reasons why the iPhone 7 Plus is better for the enterprise. While you can't go wrong with either device, businesses might want to consider these five reasons to adopt the iPhone 7 plus instead of the Galaxy S8. iMessage The most glaring difference between the latest iPhone and Galaxy models is a lack of iMessage on Android. The popular messaging app is restricted to the iOS and MacOS ecosystem -- and it might be a selling point if most of your contacts use an iPhone. For the enterprise, iMessage is encrypted out of the box, while on Android, you need to download a third-party app (like WhatsApp) to get the same end-to encryption. And if your business is international, iMessage is free iPhone to iPhone, so you won't incur any SMS fees when employees travel. Continuity If your company relies heavily on iOS and MacOS, then the iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 plus offer the best in continuity. The iPhone, Mac and iPad are designed to work seamlessly across one another -- you can start an email on one device and finish it on another. You can even make and receive phone calls from a Macbook if your iPhone is nearby. The best part is it's built into every Apple device, so IT won't have to purchase or support a third-party solution. It's easy to maintain and requires little on IT's end. Plus, it's an ecosystem that most workers will be familiar with, allowing them to stay productive. [ Related story: 5 underrated features of the Samsung Galaxy S8 ] User-friendly OS Android has come a long way in ease-of-use, and that's especially true on the S8. Samsung's latest Android skin features less bloatware than ever before and it's more intuitive than stock Android. But it's still nowhere near as user-friendly as iOS. There's a lot more to customize in Android, but with that comes more opportunity for feature-overload. Apple's devices work, and they work well. In contrast, a device like the S8 will take a little more effort to get it the way you want it. Apple is at an advantage because the company builds its hardware and software, whereas Android is adopted by different manufacturers. Apple's closed eco system means they can optimize their already lightweight OS to work as best it can on the iPhone and iPad. The user-friendly nature of iOS also means there's less of a learning curve if IT departments deploy iPhones. Chances are, most of your company is currently using or has already used an iPhone in the past, so IT can spend less time training, answering questions or troubleshooting. Apps Android apps are looking better than ever -- and with some, like Spotify, there's hardly a difference between the iOS and Android versions. And, while Android mobile apps might be catching up, that's only true on smartphones. There are far more apps on iOS that are optimized for the iPhone and iPad, while Android apps are severely lacking for tablets. The reality is Android apps aren't a priority for app developers; it's easier to develop on iOS and expand to Android once it gains popularity. That means it's also easier for businesses to build enterprise apps on iOS and deploy them quickly. They won't have to consider developing for multiple platforms or hardware. Fingerprint Scanner The worst feature on the Galaxy S8 is the fingerprint scanner, which is located on the back of the device right next to the camera. You'll get used to it -- I have -- but you will smudge your camera more often than you'd like. And it's not as intuitive as a fingerprint scanner built into the home button, a feature most of us have grown used to. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus still have the fingerprint scanner in the home button, which will help IT ensure that employees are using secure unlock methods. And that's especially true since the Galaxy S8 facial recognition can be tricked with a selfie. Giving everyone easy access to a home-button fingerprint scanner will make it easier for IT to ensure enterprise mobile devices are properly secured.

Tech Apple Science Cars Samsung Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES     IPad Pro 2 Rumors Hint At WWDC Launch Posted: Apr 25 2017, 5:47am CDT | by Shane McGlaun, in Rumors | Apple     Among the rumors for iPAd Pro 2 is a mini version of the tablet There have been plenty of rumors about the iPad Pro 2 over the last few months, yet the launch of new iPad models came and went with no iPad Pro 2 debuting. Some rumors are now making the rounds that suggest the iPad Pro 2 will debut in June at WWDC. Don't Miss: The hottest Apple Rumors for 2017 According to these rumors, Apple plans to use the iPad Pro 2 to show off iOS 11, which The Christian Post reports will launch at WWDC. There have been reports of low iPad Pro stock, which is something that often heralds the introduction of new versions of products at Apple. A big sign of a new product coming is price reductions on remaining stock of the current model, something that hasn't happened yet with the iPad Pro. the reason for no price reductions may be that stock levels are so low already. Claims indicate that stock is very low in Apple Stores around the country. I'm not sure how much accuracy there is in those assumptions though. There are four Apple Stores within 70 miles of me and each of them lists the 9.7-inch iPad Pro 32GB WiFi version as in stock and reach for pickup right now. Two of those same stores list the 12.9-inch iPad Pro 32GB WiFi version as in stock for delivery today. Rumors continue to suggest that the iPad Pro 2 will have a 12.9-inch size along with other sizes. I would expect the same two sizes that the current iPad Pro 2 offers to be available and an iPad Pro mini is expected. True Tone color matching tech is rumroed for the screen and the processor is tippd as an A10X unit. 3D touch is rumroed and a bump in internal storage to 512GB is rumored.

Tech Apple Science Cars Samsung Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES     Apple Delays Carpool Karaoke Original Series Posted: Apr 25 2017, 5:24am CDT | by Shane McGlaun, in News | Apple     There is no word on what is causing delays with the original series Many fans of Apple Music find the idea of TV shows on the service to be uninteresting, but that hasn't stopped Apple from moving forward with its idea for original programming. One of the first shows for the service was supposed to be Carpool Karaoke: The Series, a series that was to be based on a segment from "The Late Late Show with James Corden." Don't Miss: The best Deal on a new Samsung Galaxy S8 Originally Apple planned to premiere the show in April, but that launch was delayed. A premiere party was set for March originally, but was postponed and reset for this past Monday, but was again cancelled due to the show's launch getting delayed reports MacRumors. Apple purchased the rights for Carpool Karaoke in mid-2016 with plans to make a series based on the segment without having involvement from James Corden in each episode. Apple's version of the show will see different hosts for each episode paired with different artists who will drive around and sing their favorite tunes from their Apple Music playlists. The show is to be made up of 16 half hour episodes and aims to surprise people who happen to pull up next to a car with big stars singing out tunes in the next lane over. Apple's goal is to lure in more subscribers with the show to Apple Music, it will only be available for subscribers to watch. Assuming it ever launches. Apple is mum on what is causing delays in the launch of the show. "Carpool Karaoke: The Series" will star James Corden, Will Smith, Billy Eichner, Metallica, Alicia Keys, John Legend, Ariana Grande, Seth MacFarlane, Chelsea Handler, Blake Shelton, Michael Strahan, John Cena, Shaquille O'Neal, Maisie Williams, Sophie Turner, and more, with a different host for each episode.

April 25, 2017 08:00 ET Spindle Names Brian Sathianathan to Advisory Board Former Early Key Member of Apple's Secret Products and Accomplished Technology Entrepreneur Joins Spindle Team SCOTTSDALE, AZ--(Marketwired - Apr 25, 2017) - Spindle, Inc. (OTCQB: SPDL) ("Spindle" or the "Company"), an emerging provider of comprehensive digital commerce solutions, today announced that Brian Sathianathan has joined the Company's advisory board. Sathianathan is an accomplished technology entrepreneur and investor well known in the Venture Capital community. From 2001-2008, he worked at Apple where he became one of the early key members of Apple's Secret Products working on the iPhone. After architecting and building their internal enterprise platforms and security applications, he moved into the consumer product area and led software development teams at Apple's Secret Product (NPI) group for a few years. His team worked on the first iPhone's security and provisioning system that outlasted against device unlock attacks.  After leaving Apple, he was the Founder & President of Avot Media which enabled streaming video into a wide variety of mobile smartphones and tablets, where he oversaw both local and international revenue growth, resulting in a sale to publicly traded Smith Micro. In 2011, he joined Turner Broadcasting, and helped start its Media Camp, Turner's startup incubator that focused on investing in and developing digital-media startups. During his tenure, the group engaged on the business side resulting in 13 seed investments into media startups. In November 2013, he cofounded Iterate.ai (https://www.iterate.ai/), an innovation lab for emerging technologies. Iterate discovers and curates emerging technologies, then implements proof-of-concept tests (a.k.a. proof-of-value tests) for a global partner base. Close partners include a few dozen large companies representing beauty, media, accessories and apparel, DIY, and footwear categories representing $600 billion in revenue. For large companies, Iterate reduces the time, costs and risks associated with analyzing and deploying innovative startup technologies. At the same time, startups get special visibility and credibility. Brian Sathianathan stated, "I'm excited to join the Spindle team at what I believe is an opportunistic time. Having just completed the sale of my company CoverCake, I have a strong vested interest, along with Spindle management, in our collective success. I firmly believe that the combination of the strengths of the CoverCake machine intelligence and backend solutions will dramatically enhance both data procuration and refinement for the CATALYST Platform. This is as a very positive and tangible step towards the mutual creation of a powerful and disruptive digital commerce engine that should provide enhanced marketing tools for CATALYST's internal programs and their merchants alike, driving revenue for both."  Spindle Interim Chief Executive Officer Dr. Jack Scott stated, "I'm extremely pleased to welcome Brian to the Spindle team. I'm a big believer that a company's value can be best measured by the quality of its people. Brian is not only a highly accomplished and well regarded technology innovator, but he is a consummate professional. I expect his addition to be the first of what should be more to come, all of whom will share the common goal of value creation." Scott concluded, "As one of the company's largest investors, I think it should be abundantly clear that my goals are directly aligned with those of our shareholders. I also appreciate the importance of corporate transparency in terms of communicating with investors, with a full understanding of what it was like for me as an early shareholder looking from the outside in. With this in mind, and on the heels of having just filed our 2016 Form 10K, I am currently working on a communication to advise you of recent progress. In the meantime, our team remains focused on the company's underlying fundamentals, which I believe have been improved with the addition of CoverCake to our digital marketing arsenal, and Brian Sathianathan to our Advisory Board."  About Spindle Spindle is an innovator of merchant and consumer-facing commerce solutions focused on the Small and Medium-sized Business (SMB) market. The CATALYST Marketing System components and CATALYST IP were included in the asset acquisition from Catalyst Business Development, Inc. which Spindle, Inc. completed in 2015. It is focused on payment processing services and integrating value-added capabilities that enhance merchant revenue and increase consumer loyalty, experience, and stickiness. Spindle is taking a unique approach to orchestrating commerce transactions of all types by leveraging best-in-class technology, multiple solutions for vertical markets, and a deeply experienced payments management team to define and drive the way commerce transactions will be performed in the future. This commerce experience will be independent of mechanism, unifying a consumer's experience across all platforms (mobile, browser, kiosk, etc.), taking today's solutions to a new level via technology integrations and strategic partnerships.

It took its name from the semiconductor businesses that seeded a patch of Northern California in the 1960s, attracting brainiacs from around the world. But the modern history of the place really began in 1976, when Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak first huddled together in a stuffy Los Altos garage to invent a cool, affordable personal computer, the Apple I—and a company that borrowed its name. Ever since, Silicon Valley has been the engine of tech innovation in the United States, powered by life-changing ideas, optimism, bushels of venture capital cash, and lots and lots of coders, engineers, and developers. And something else, too: nosebleed-inducing real estate prices. That has led to a national quest to find the next Silicon Valleys—the ones that America's up-and-coming tech talent could actually afford to live in. Related Articles Millennial Magnets: The Top 10 Cities Where Young People Want to Be The Apple Effect: After Spaceship Campus Lands, Will Silicon Valley Prices Soar? We Found the Unicorns: 7 Iconic Abodes in the Real Silicon Valley The harsh truth is that even the decent month's salary earned by many skilled Silicon Valley workers these days barely covers one of those fabled Los Altos garages. The sky-high prices may explain why the number of folks moving to the region dropped by 27% from 2012 to 2015, according to the latest data from the think tank Joint Venture Silicon Valley. "Silicon Valley is still the hub it's always been," says John Reed, senior executive director for the tech recruiting firm Robert Half Technology, headquartered in Menlo Park, CA. "There are other markets, though, that are bringing on tech professionals at a greater pace." Of course, some of those alternate tech meccas—Boston, Seattle, Denver—already have prices that rival the original valley. So where are the next tech superhubs—the cities bursting with opportunities, fun, and affordability? "You may get paid a little bit less if you take a job in, say, Austin, but the cost of living is so much lower," says John Boitnott, digital consultant for Entrepreneur magazine. "And you'll be able to have a better existence." So, as an upstanding service to the United States' fastest-growing industry, our data team ranked the 500 largest U.S. cities by these tech-savvy factors—and then eliminated those where housing affordability is out of whack, even for a decently paid engineer or developer. Percentage of employment in the tech industry Share of technology/engineering jobs out of all job postings on indeed.com and Dice.com Operations of major tech companies, including Google, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, IBM, Facebook, and Cisco Number of startups per capita Number of tech companies per capita, including smaller ones that may not be household names Tech crowdfunding projects and tech meet-ups per capita Real estate and rental affordability (based on 28% or less of an average engineer's salary) Got all that? Put on your best wearable tech, and let's check out these 10 cities to get your geek on. Photo: Realtor.com The next big tech hubs are still affordable.  The next big tech hubs are still affordable.  1. Austin, TX Median home price: $392,000 Average salary of engineering jobs: $87,600 In 1967, IBM was the first big tech corporation to open its doors in Austin. It took some time, but the gates have since opened wide. Titans such as Google, Apple, and Facebook now compete for the most promising grads from the University of Texas–Austin. Local endeavors like RetailMeNot, an online coupon company, and HomeAway, an Airbnb competitor, have grown into multinational firms. And each year, the South by Southwest conference brings thousands of attendees together to celebrate emerging (and sometimes whimsically emerging) technologies. This year, the Austin company Kasita, a builder of smart tiny homes, made a big splash. The startup energy is palpable when you enter Capital Factory, a renowned local incubator brimming with code-wrangling and device-juggling folks. For as little as $350 a month, they get access to co-working space, meet-ups, hack-athons, and, best of all, frequent happy hours with like-minded engineers. Austin has seen more upscale restaurants lately, where investors close big deals, but great $3 taco places still abound. A home goes for $392,000—not exactly cheap, but still way less than half the price in San Francisco. And most of these properties are stand-alone houses with yards out back. Prices in the city had been rising in the double digits for the past few years, but the appreciation slowed to just 5% in 2016. Oh yeah—it's a cool and welcoming place, too. "Different lifestyles are celebrated here," says Paul O'Brien, a startup consultant and entrepreneur at Austin's MediaTech Ventures. "That comfort with so many different perspectives enables us to try new things and be creative." 2. Atlanta, GA Median home price: $349,900 Average salary of engineering jobs: $85,000 Atlanta is (almost) a secret in the tech world. It's one of the few cities to have Google Fiber's gigabit-speed service—roughly 50 times faster Wi-Fi than the rest of America. It flies. Also speedy: the path to homeownership. You can score an affordable home, within either the thriving city limits or the suburbs, a co-working space for $300 a month, and a sweet, low cost of living. The city pulls talent from top-notch schools like Georgia Tech to feed its long list of Fortune 500 companies. The fertile Southern soil has generated nearly 2,000 tech companies. "We have a growing startup community with a lot of momentum," says David Lightburn, co-founder of Atlanta Tech Village, a co-working space where established entrepreneurs serve as mentors for newbies. "It's a community that's very pay-it-forward—with successful entrepreneurs who are willing to give back." Entrepreneurs often get their start at Georgia Tech's Advanced Technology Development Center, which claims to be the largest and oldest campus-based tech incubator in the country. 3. Minneapolis, MN Median home price: $280,000 Average salary of engineering jobs: $84,600 Minneapolis boasts a certain coolness factor (and we're not just talking about its ungodly frigid winters), plenty of tech talent, and an exciting startup culture. That may be because the city is the home of a dozen universities, including the University of Minnesota, which churn out highly educated tech workers. Lots of early-stage tech companies here revolve around the health care industry, thanks to local big businesses like the Mayo Clinic and UnitedHealth Group. But new business ideas spring up every day from locals, including SportsEngine, which helps sports leagues manage websites. These startups are moving into old warehouses and historic buildings across the downtown area. Co-working spaces like COCO and Restore Colab provide affordable open-space workstations, along with conference rooms, whiteboards—and those '70s faves, beanbag chairs. "What they call 'Minnesota nice' is real," says John Malone, a software engineer at Apruve, a financial tech startup in Minneapolis. "The startup culture here is very positive, with everyone trying to help each other out. It's a different work ethic [from Silicon Valley]. Things are flexible." 4. Raleigh-Durham, NC Median home price: $330,000 Average salary of engineering jobs: $87,500 There may be no better place to launch a tech career than the Research Triangle Park, one of the world's most prominent research centers for biotechnology and engineering. It's home to Fortune 100 companies such as IBM, Cisco, and Sony Ericsson. Raleigh and Durham form two points of the Research Triangle; Chapel Hill is the third. Housing prices in Raleigh-Durham are low, and the stock of homes is beautiful, from sleek apartments downtown to Georgian-style homes in the suburbs. Just a few hundred dollars can get you a desk at the area's many co-working offices—even one in the basement of a renovated tobacco warehouse. How's that for an entrepreneurial spirit? And when folks aren't coming up with the next Tinder or smart home appliance, they can relax at the Boxcar Bar + Arcade. As the name suggests, the joint boasts two dozen beers on draft and more than 70 arcade games. Bring on the Ms. Pac-Man tournaments, stat! 5. Pittsburgh, PA Median home price: $179,900 Average salary of engineering jobs: $74,800 When Uber chose to test its robot-driven taxis in Pittsburgh last year, many wondered why it wasn't happening in San Francisco. But the Steel City is the home of Carnegie Mellon University, where the technology for the autonomous taxi is being developed. The onetime manufacturing hub has become decidedly high-tech in recent years. Google and Intel already have a foothold here, and the German software company SAP and virtual reality headset provider Oculus are setting up new offices. The city has also spun off noteworthy startups like the artificial intelligence company Argo AI, which just received $1 billion from Ford to develop—you guessed it—self-driving cars. And the best part about the city may be its very low cost of living. Homes are affordable, and two-bedroom rentals go for an average of $822. Meanwhile, a ticket to Thrival, a terrific festival that mixes innovative robotics and biotech projects with concerts, will set you back just $35. 6. Chicago, IL Median home price: $299,900 Average salary of engineering jobs: $85,100 Silicon Valley ideas meet the Midwestern way of life in Chicago. This has created a low-key and collaborative startup community. Excelerate Labs offers a nationally acclaimed accelerator program driven by Sam Yagan, co-founder of OKCupid. Each selected company gets $75,000 in cash to build product for a final demo in 13 weeks. And a rich stream of talent comes from renowned universities like Northwestern University and the University of Chicago. "Affordability is certainly one perk among many" in Chicago, says David Kalt, founder of Reverb.com, an online marketplace for music gear. "At the end of the day, you want to spend your money where it can make the most impact—on your product and your people." Chicago isn't known for turning out "unicorns" (companies valued at $1 billion) yet. But Groupon and Grubhub were founded there, demonstrating that it is possible to hit it big in the Windy City. 7. Tempe, AZ Median home price: $320,000 Average salary of engineering jobs: $80,200 In the "Silicon Desert," Arizona State University is a powerhouse of technology advancement. Innovators create wearable tech for the visually impaired through the sense of touch, and develop 360-degree sensors for driverless cars. The ASU Research Park is a 30-year university and industry collaboration, with tenants like GoDaddy, a web hosting company. West Coast tech companies are taking note. The digital satellite telecommunications company ViaSat has set up a new research facility in the Research Park. Amazon leased offices last year and is now recruiting 70 software developers. Every February, entrepreneurs converge on nearby Phoenix for the five-day PHX Startup Week, featuring educational events, one-on-one mentor sessions, lively debates, and competitions. Oh, and it's free. The housing market also looks good for buyers on a budget. They can snag a spacious, single-family house with a stunning desert landscape in the low $300,000s. 8. Salt Lake City, UT Median home price: $328,000 Average salary of engineering jobs: $78,400 It's not just ski bums and bunnies who love Salt Lake City. Coders, self-starters, and angel investors have also become fans. Blue-chip companies like eBay and Adobe have offices in the city, reaping the benefits of a skilled workforce, low taxes, and cheap real estate. That has led to an overflow of entrepreneurs. Venafi, which protects digital keys, heads up a thriving cybersecurity sector. Instructure, an online course management system, is among the hottest unicorns in edtech. Plenty more "soonicorns"—startups with the potential to become unicorns—have attracted investment from the likes of PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel. When they're not coding, techies can show off their true colors at the local version of Comic Con, at the "Dawn, Day and Night of the Running Dead" zombies vs. humans 5K-ish race, and the Salt City Steamfest, a costumed festival of 19th-century mechanics. Nerd-tastic! 9. Madison, WI Median home price: $269,900 Average salary of engineering jobs: $74,000 Madison has been an epicenter for big-brained Midwesterners since the University of Wisconsin–Madison was founded in 1848. But its startup tech scene has really just ballooned in the past decade. Since then, Epic Systems, a health care software firm, and EatStreet, an online food-ordering venture, have become household names. On the UW-Madison campus, one floor of student housing is set aside for student entrepreneurs to foster close collaboration. Gener8tor is a hot spot for early-stage companies on the prowl for office space and mentorship. The accelerator invests up to $140,000 in each high-growth startup multiple times a year. 10. Richmond, VA Median home price: $205,500 Average salary of engineering jobs: $84,900 Attend just one session of 1 Million Cups Richmond, a weekly event for entrepreneurs to meet and exchange ideas, and you come away feeling hell-bent on staking your own startup claim in this historic Southern town. The scene is backed by a state tax credit that encourages early-stage investment in tech startups, and talent from schools like Virginia Commonwealth University and the University of Richmond. The nonprofit group UnBoundRVA has a program that guides entrepreneurs from low-income communities, who get business training and hands-on guidance in launching their companies within a year. Incubators like Lighthouse Labs and the Annex provide office space, mentorship, and funding to fledging companies. The city also has a wealth of hippie outposts where the tech-obsessed can hang. The Galaxy Diner cooks up sci-fi-themed morsels like Nuclear Waste Burgers or Super Nova BLTs into the wee hours. Because Nuclear Waste Burgers are best consumed very late at night.

New and innovative features for smartphones and other mobile devices including virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), context-aware computation, and artificial intelligence (AI) and deep machine learning require support of more powerful computing technology, Liu indicated.   Considering that Apple is TSMC's largest customer, TSMC's enthusiasm for mobile computing to incorporate "new and innovative features" is definitely a nice hint of what's to come to Apple's iDevices.   In 2017 alone, TSMC plans to allocate about US$10 billion in capex as the company continues to make technology breakthroughs and extend Moore's Law, according to Liu.   TSMC is moving its 10nm process technology to volume production, said Liu, adding that a group of 3,000 R&D staff is being involved in the technology development. TSMC's 10nm process is ready for mass production in the second half of 2017.   TSMC is set to move its newer 7nm FinFET technology to volume production in 2018, Liu indicated. The company also plans its second-generation 7nm process dubbed 7nm Plus that will adopt extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography technology for higher performance and lower costs.   TSMC has started R&D of its 5nm process technology, with risk production scheduled to kick off in the first quarter of 2019, Liu said. TSMC has also assigned hundreds of engineers to commerce its 3nm development project, Liu indicated.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

According to a report in the New York Times, Apple chief executive Tim Cook met with Uber CEO Travis Kalanick to warn him that the Uber app would be removed. The report claims that Uber failed to adhere to App Store rules by carrying out a practice known as iPhone tagging. Uber is accused of installing a line of code that enabled it to track users and identify individual iPhones even if the app had been deleted. The report also claims that Uber technicians “geofenced” the Apple headquarters in California so that employees who were tasked with examining Uber’s code would spot the iPhone tagging. While the practice was not used to track locations or activity, it could tell if the Uber app had been installed and then deleted. However, Apple has previously banned this technique for privacy reasons. The New York Times says that Tim Cook met with Travis Kalanick in 2015 and told him that if the practice continued, Uber would be removed the app store. Uber said it has not stopped tagging smartphones and does so in order to protect its users, However, it did say it has modified the practice in order to comply with Apple’s rules. In a statement to TechCrunch, a spokesperson for Uber said: “We absolutely do not track individual users or their location if they’ve deleted the app. As the New York Times story notes towards the very end, this is a typical way to prevent fraudsters from loading Uber onto a stolen phone, putting in a stolen credit card, taking an expensive ride and then wiping the phone—over and over again. Similar techniques are also used for detecting and blocking suspicious logins to protect our users’ accounts. Being able to recognize known bad actors when they try to get back onto our network is an important security measure for both Uber and our users.” Earlier this month, it was reported that for years Uber used a secret tool in order to avoid authorities in countries where its ride hailing service faced resistance from law enforcement agencies.

The actions — first, digital fingerprinting users’ devices and then, geofencing Apple’s headquarters to veil the company’s actions — earned Uber CEO Travis Kalanick an in-person rebuke from Apple CEO Tim Cook, who threatened to kick Uber out of the powerful Apple App Store. Asked for comment, Uber said that it does not track individual users or their location if they have deleted the Uber app. It said that the persistent ID tags protected against driver fraud and allowed it to keep fraudsters from loading the Uber app onto a stolen phone, putting in a stolen credit card, taking an expensive ride and then wiping the phone again and again. The company did not respond to the Times’ allegation that it has attempted to hide its use from Apple. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment . The allegation is one of several in a piece that outlines Uber CEO Travis Kalanick’s long history of flouting rules and corporate norms — a legacy that helped it overcome myriad opposition from cities and taxi unions but that has forced it into a leadership crisis that threatens Kalanick’s job. The Apple issue came about in 2014 and early 2015. According to the paper, Uber was fighting fraud worldwide at a time when it offered bonuses to drivers if they did more rides. In China and elsewhere, drivers would use stolen iPhones that had had their information digitally wiped to create dozens of fake email addresses for false, new riders, who would then request rides. The drivers accepted, increasing their ride count. In an effort to thwart such deceits, Uber created persistent ID tags on iPhones so that each could be identified even if the phone’s information was wiped. This ran afoul of Apple rules that prohibit such "fingerprinting" of phones, meant to preserve customer privacy when phones change hands. To keep Apple from discovering what it was doing, Uber engineers created a faked version of its computer code, without the fingerprinting, which would automatically be shown to anyone who looked at it from the physical location of Apple headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., using a technology called geofencing. According to the story, Apple engineers elsewhere saw the fingerprinting and figured out what was happening. Apple’s Cook called Kalanick into his office in early 2015 to lay down the law — stop the fingerprinting, or Apple would remove the Uber app from its App Store. Kalanick acquiesced, aware that if Uber lost access to iPhones it would lose millions of customers, the Times reported. — USA Today Advertisement Advertise With Us Report Error Submit a Tip RefundRefund You can comment on most stories on winnipegfreepress.com.

The new API has been designed to make embedding of Live Photos taken using Apple iPhones easier into websites. Live photos which were introduced with the iPhone 6s and the iPhone 6s Plus basically capture 1.5 seconds video both after and before capturing the image. When users press down on a Live Photo in their iPhones the image animates appears like a tiny clipping with that seems to have captured the action before and after a photo. With the new LivePhotosKit JavaScript-based API, these Live Photos captured from iPhones can now be easily embedded into websites. Once embedded the Live Photo first loads and then all a user has to do is move the cursor over the “Live” button to animate. “This new JavaScript-based API makes it easy to embed Live Photos on your websites. In addition to enabling Live Photos on iOS and macOS, you can now let users display their Live Photos on the web.” said Apple in a press release. Live photos have been around since 2015, but there are few social networks that actually support them. Thanks to a WhatsApp update, iOS users can now at least share Live Photos as GIFs of video, making them available on a platform other than their iPhones. So far, Live photos can captured using an iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus. Live Photos are so far only supported on devices running iOS 9, OS X El Capitan and WatchOS 2 or later. Hopefully things should get better now that the new API is out.

In fact recently Apple was granted a permit by the California DMV that would allow them to test self-driving vehicles on California roads. However it looks like we might have another contender. According to a report from The Wall Street Journal, it has been revealed that Amazon could also be interested in the technology. The report claims that the company has form a team to focus on driverless technology which comprises of about a dozen or so employees. This team was reportedly formed more than a year ago. Now before you get too excited about the prospect of maybe self-driving Amazon-branded cars or delivery vans, the report claims that the group is more of an in-house think tank where Amazon is merely exploring the idea of how to take advantage of the technology. It is possible that maybe we could end up with self-driving delivery trucks, but that remains to be seen. The company has been exploring ways to make its deliveries, such as using drones. Amazon has also tried to cut out the middle person by purchasing its own jets, so the notion that they could eventually get rid of delivery drivers in the future doesn’t really seem like much of a stretch. However until we hear from Amazon officially, do take it with a grain of salt for now. Filed in Rumors >Transportation. Read more about Amazon and self-driving cars.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Smartphones Apple iPhone 8 launch may not be delayed as Samsung will ship OLED panels in June as planned: Report At a time when various reports have suggested that iPhone 8 could be delayed, a new report says that Apple will stick to its usual iPhone launch cycle. Kukil Bora   April 25, 2017 16:23 IST An Apple iPhone 7 and the company logo are seen in this illustration picture taken in Bordeaux, France, February 1, 2017.REUTERS/Regis Duvignau With consumers getting their hands on Samsung's newly designed Galaxy S8, all eyes are now on Apple. To counter the appealing Galaxy S8 and its projected success over time, the iPhone-maker will have to offer an unparalleled combination of innovation and aesthetics with its next-generation flagship smartphone, dubbed the iPhone 8. One of the most speculated features of the redesigned iPhone 8 is a new OLED panel, which is said to be supplied by Samsung. However, these new display panels are among the few hardware upgrades in the iPhone 8 that, some analysts believe, could delay the device's launch, limiting total shipments of Apple smartphones for 2017. Brushing off reports that iPhone 8's mass production could be pushed back to October or November, a new report from South Korea said that the first ever OLED iPhone won't be delayed due to supply shortage as Samsung is expected to start shipping the OLED panels in June as planned. Samsung has also reportedly planned to place orders for key components, including flexible printed circuit board (FPCB) -- which is essential for the connection between a display panel and the processing chip -- within a month. Therefore, if everything falls according to plans, the assembly of OLED panels for the iPhone 8 will start in May, followed by their shipment in early June. The report also cited industry sources saying that concerns over sophisticated panel production might have exaggerated to create rumours of a delayed launch of the iPhone 8. On Monday, KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said in a note to investors that Apple would launch the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus models as per the schedule, but production issues would postpone the launch of the iPhone 8. In addition to the OLED panels, Kuo also blamed Apple's custom-designed A11 10-nanometer SoC, the new 3D Touch module and 3D sensing cameras for the potential delayed launch of the next-gen iPhone. The curved display patent was granted to Apple in June, 2016.USPTO Meanwhile, analysts at UBS said that assembly service of the OLED iPhone 8 has been planned for a ramp up in October. According to them, it's a planned move by Apple as it needs more time to finalise many innovative new designs. The upcoming iPhone 8 is speculated to feature a number of cutting-edge components to take on the revamped Galaxy S8 and other popular rivals. There were also reports suggesting that Apple could incorporate a bezel-free design and an on-screen fingerprint scanner, something that is lacking on the Galaxy S8. Jang Hyun-jun, an analyst at UBI Research, the screen on the iPhone 8 could cover its entire front, compared to the Galaxy S8's display area ration at 83.6 percent. In February, Apple was granted a patent that describes a fingerprint scanner built right into the iPhone screen. However, it should be noted that the actual adoption of the component depends on the capability of the display maker's technology to integrate the sensor into the panel. Since Samsung itself decided to relocate the fingerprint scanner from the home button to the back of the Galaxy S8 due to such technical difficulties, an on-screen fingerprint sensor on the iPhone 8 seems unlikely if the device embraces a bezel-less form factor.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « 'CBS This Morning' to Interview Apple's SVP Angela Ahrendts Tomorrow | Main | TSMC Sees AI, Augmented/Virtual Reality as Important Market Drivers for Mobile Devices over the Next Few Years » April 25, 2017 Apple Granted 60 Patents today covering a Hidden Connector for iDevices and iDevices encased in Ceramic   The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office officially published a series of 60 newly granted patents for Apple Inc. today. In this particular report we cover yet another revolutionary idea. Apple has invented a method of creating a virtually invisible connector port on the backside of an iPhone that is concealed and able to resist water, debris or gasses. The iPhone's connector would be able to penetrate this seemingly invisible port when needed and when the connector is removed, the seam, using a self-healing material, would close and seem invisible once again. The invention may be used with any iDevice including an Apple Watch. The second granted patent noted in this report gives us the impression of iPhone components encased within a transparent ceramic material forming the outer case. We wrap up this week's granted patent report with our traditional listing of the remaining granted patents that were issued to Apple today.   Granted Patent: Electronic Device with Hidden Connector   Apple's newly granted patent covers their invention relating to electronic devices and in particular to electronic devices that include one or more electrical connectors that enable connection to an external device. . In some embodiments, the electrical connectors are configured to be equipped with a self-healing barrier layer providing an aesthetic covering for the connector as well as protection for the contacts within the connector and for circuitry within the device housing.   Apple's patent FIG. 2 is a rear perspective view of the electronic device shown in FIG. 1 with an audio connector and a data connector. Even though the patent figures depict an iPod touch or iPhone, the hidden connector is also prominently mentioned as relating to a possible future Apple Watch as the patent refers another embodiment being a "wearable device" worn around the wrist.   Apple's granted patent 9,634,426 was originally filed in Q and published today by the US Patent and Trademark Office. This is Apple second granted patent for this invention in a year. See our May 2016 patent report here for more details. Today's granted patent shows that Apple has added more patent claims.   Granted Patent: Electronic Component Embedded in Ceramic Material   Apple's newly granted patent covers their invention relating to ceramic materials having an electronic component embedded therein, and more particularly to electrically active components embedded in a ceramic surface defining a portion of an outer surface of an electronic device. The cover glass may be bonded, affixed, or otherwise attached to a remainder of the housing, thereby forming an enclosure for the electronic device.   Apple's patent FIG. 1 above depicts a perspective view of a sample electronic device having an electronic component embedded in a ceramic material.   Apple's granted patent 9,632,537 was originally filed in Q3 2013 and published today by the US Patent and Trademark Office.   The Remaining Patents granted to Apple Today   Note: In order to see a clearer image of the list above, simply click on the image above to enlarge it.
