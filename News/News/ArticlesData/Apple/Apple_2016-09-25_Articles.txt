ADVERTISEMENT Early adopters of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus have had a big change to get used to with the removal of the 3.5mm headphone jack. This wasn't made any easier by the new Lightning connection timing out and stopping music from playing. Users of the Lightning EarPods have complained the headphones weren't responding after a while. Reports said the buttons stopped functioning, meaning it was impossible to pause or play music, turn it up or down, or access AI personal assistant Siri.

Apple has obliged with the release of iOS 10.0.2. The new update, according to Tim Cook's company, has three main fixes: the headphone bug, a fix to stop the photos app from crashing, and another that stopped some app extensions from working. It "addresses an issue that could prevent headphone audio controls from temporarily not working," the release notes about the update say. When iOS 10 was introduced by Apple at the start of September it billed the update as one of the biggest it had ever made to the operating systems of iPhones and iPads. The biggest difference turned out to be the introduction of layers of AI to some applications. ADVERTISEMENT Maps, Messages and Photos now include Apple's AI and offer users personalised options. Photos can, for instance, scan images and categorise them in the gallery by people and places involved. Messages undoubtedly had the biggest overhaul in the iOS. The app now lets users send full screen animations and effects, and a dedicated app store was introduced for Messaging apps.

Tech Entertainment Business Social Deals Podcast About Security Image Source: Zach Epstein, BGR Apple says weak iOS 10 iTunes backup encryption will be fixed Chris Smith @chris_writes September 26th, 2016 at 4:10 PM Share Tweet iPhone backups are easier to crack if the device is running Apple’s iOS 10. Hackers discovered the issues, saying that Apple weakened backup security with iOS 10. But Apple is already on the case and plans to issue fixes for it. DON’T MISS: iPhone 7 review According to Forbes, well-known Russian forensic company, Elcomsoft said that cracking the logins for backups stored on a Mac or PC is considerably easier now. If that name sounds familiar, that’s because it’s believed that Elcomsoft helped hackers crack the Apple ID accounts of several celebrities in 2014, just a few days ahead of Apple’s iPhone 6 announcement. The company found that Apple was using a weaker password protection mechanism for manual backups via iTunes on Mac and PC. Using CPU acceleration, Elcomsoft could potentially guess backup passwords 40 times faster when compared to cracking iOS 9 with a speedier GPU tool. Using an Intel i5 CPU, the task was incredibly faster – an “astonishing 2,500 times faster,” as Forbes puts it. The computer would try 6 million passwords per second compared to 2,400. That lowers significantly the amount of time you have to wait for a computer to guess the correct password and access a backup data file. “We discovered an alternative password verification mechanism added to iOS 10 backups,” Elcomsoft’s Oleg Afonin wrote in a blog post on Friday. “We looked into it and found out that the new mechanism skips certain security checks, allowing us to try passwords approximately 2500 times faster compared to the old mechanism used in iOS 9 and older.” Apple, meanwhile, issued a statement acknowledging the problem. “We’re aware of an issue that affects the encryption strength for backups of devices on iOS 10 when backing up to iTunes on the Mac or PC,” a spokesperson said. We are addressing this issue in an upcoming security update. This does not affect iCloud backups. We recommend users ensure their Mac or PC are protected with strong passwords and can only be accessed by authorized users. Additional security is also available with FileVault whole disk encryption.” And yes, you totally should protect the iTunes backups of your iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch with a password. That’s the only way to encrypt the iTunes backup.

Apple is reportedly building a Siri-based smart home device to rival Amazon's Echo. The project—designed to control appliances, locks, lights, and curtains via voice activation—has entered prototype testing, Bloomberg reports. In an attempt to stand out from other smart speakers like the Echo and Google's upcoming Home device, Cupertino is using more advanced microphone and speaker technology. It may also employ facial recognition to help identify who is in the room or a person's emotional state, according to Bloomberg. The unnamed product—what would be the company's most significant hardware release since the Apple Watch—is expected to include iPhone-like Siri commands. Users could, for instance, ask the device to read emails, send text messages, post to social media, and stream music. Bloomberg also tipped the integration of mapping data, allowing the hub to inform owners of the best time to leave the house to beat traffic. An Apple spokesman declined to comment on the rumors and speculation. The tech titan first showed interest in home automation more than two years ago, with the introduction of HomeKit, which lets gadget makers link their smart home devices to iOS. Tell Siri to "get ready for bed," for example, and HomeKit-linked devices could make sure the garage door is closed, the thermostat is lowered, and the lights are dimmed. Cupertino engineers are reportedly testing the Echo rival in their homes right now—a common practice by Apple before launching new products, Bloomberg says. Related Why You Won't See an 'Apple Echo' Why You Won't See an 'Apple Echo' Google's Home device, meanwhile, is expected this year; look for more details at the company's Oct. 4 event in San Francisco. Earlier this month, Amazon introduced a cheaper Echo Dot speaker for $49.99—$40 less than the original model, which arrived in March. Like its taller Echo sibling, the Dot gives access to Amazon's voice-powered personal assistant Alexa. Editor's Note: This story was updated at 1:25 p.m. Eastern with a response from Apple.

M Monday, Jan 02 2017 | Updated at 10:09 PM EST Stay Connected With Us F T R Opinion Academics Students Special Reports Sports Finance Tech Career College Sep 26, 2016 07:45 AM EDT By Vinay Patel, UniversityHerald Reporter iPad Air 3 Release Date, Specs & Rumors: The New Tablet Likely To Be Unveiled In First Quarter Of 2017? iPad Air 3 Release Date, Specs And Features: New iPad Coming Early 2017? (Photo : Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) The recently concluded iPhone 7 unveiling event didn't quite turn out to be what avid Apple fans were anticipating it to be. While the Cupertino based tech firm unveiled the highly anticipated iPhone 7 and Apple Watch 2, the company remained mum regarding its line of tablet flagships, particularly the equally anticipated, iPad 3. That being said, optimistic fans hazard a guess that since Apple iPad 3 was a no-show during the iPhone 7 unveiling event that took place on September 7, the next likely timeframe for the device's launch could be sometime in the first quarter of 2017. The speculations stems from a recently released theory by acclaimed analyst from KGI Securities, Ming-Chi Kuo. Kuo claimed that Apple is likely to roll out three different variants of iPads in 2017 - the 12.9-inch iPad Pro 2, 10.5-inch iPad Pro, and an economical 9.7-inch iPad. It's worth noting that Kuo did not include a variant for the last mentioned iPad on the list. This stirred conversations among gadget enthusiasts that this could be the long awaited iPad Air 3, MacRumors reported. Another reason why Apple could opt to launch the device in a "spaced-out" manner is the dramatically dropping sales of tablets in the wake of the recent onslaught of hybrid tablet's popularity. Likewise, the purported iPad Air 3 is expected to boast an array of awe-inspiring features, and if the device's 2017 release date comes to fruition, it won't be surprising if the purported device turns out to be at the top of every buyer's list as it is said to come with some killer features. The iPad Air 3 is expected to be powered by a robust A10 processor and a fresh iOS 10 out of the box. Moreover, it is likely to come with the minimum 64GB of internal memory. But that's not all! If rumors proved to be true, the iPad Air 3 will feature an AMOLED (active-matrix organic light-emitting diode) display with 2,048 x 1,538 resolution. In addition, it is said to be equipped with four-speaker audio system, and Apple support, ChristianDaily reported. Furthermore, iPad Air 3 is pegged to support the tech firm's Apple Pencil; however, those interested in getting their hands on the accessory will need to shell out some extra money.

Sep 27 2016 at 8:03 AM Updated Sep 27 2016 at 8:03 AM Save article Print Apple prepares Amazon Echo-like device Share Share via Email Share on Google Plus Post on facebook wall Share on twitter Post to Linkedin Share on Reddit With an initiative code-named "Invisible Hand", Apple hopes to give users the ability to fully control their devices through a Siri command system within three years, one source said. ajambrosino.com by Mark Gurman and Ian King Apple is pressing ahead with the development of an Echo-like smart-home device based on the Siri voice assistant, according to people familiar with the matter. Started more than two years ago, the project has exited the research and development lab and is now in prototype testing, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing unannounced Apple projects. Like Amazon's Echo, the device is designed to control appliances, locks, lights and curtains via voice activation, the people said. Apple hasn't finalised plans for the device and could still scrap the project. If a product reaches the market, it would be Apple's most significant piece of new hardware since the company announced the Apple Watch in 2014. Echo has been a surprise hit, even to Apple engineers working on their competing project, and is already being baked into smart-home systems made by a range of companies.

Besides taking on the competition, Apple is looking for a new hot seller to augment the iPhone. The company is attempting to differentiate itself from Echo and Google Home with more advanced microphone and speaker technology, two people said. Some of the prototypes in testing include facial recognition sensors, another person said. Apple has acquired the facial recognition startups Faceshift and Emotient over the past two years, which may help the device act based on who is in a room or a person's emotional state. Besides serving as a controller for other smart-home devices, the speaker would theoretically be able to process many of the Siri commands available on the iPhone. For example, users may be able to ask the device to read emails, send text messages and Tweets, and stream content from Apple Music. Apple has also considered integrating mapping information into the speaker, another person said, potentially allowing the device to notify a user when it's time to leave the house for an appointment. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. Before setting its sights on a standalone speaker, Apple attempted to integrate the functionality of an Amazon Echo-like device into the Apple TV, three people said. This would have allowed users to shout commands from the couch to the TV box. Those efforts were abandoned in favour of putting the voice-command features into a remote control when the latest set-top box shipped in October 2015. Apple began showing its interest in the smart-home field with the launch of HomeKit in 2014, which allows third-party smart-home accessory makers to integrate with Siri. That same year, Apple began testing early versions of Siri-driven speakers with proprietary surround sound technology. The company worked on two versions, a larger and a smaller model similar to Amazon's current line-up, and even set up a small home theatre to test prototypes. But those early efforts may not translate into a final product. The work on the speaker is a collaboration between the Cupertino, California-based company's hardware division and its Siri team, which last year was re-organised by the division's vice president, Bill Stasior. The division now consists of four main development groups: web search, proactive assistance, speech recognition, and the Siri application itself, two people said. The web search team focuses on Apple's efforts to circumvent Google search by pushing query suggestions via Apple's own servers, while the speech recognition group powers how Siri understands its users. The proactive assistance team develops functionality such as the iPhone feature that alerts users to appointments, while the application team engineers the voice assistant. Now that the device has entered the prototype stage, Apple engineers have begun secretly testing it in their homes, one of the people said. While not an indicator of the speaker's launch timeline, Apple chief Tim Cook has said he tested the iPad at home for roughly six months before its introduction. By contrast, Apple employees began testing the latest Apple TV with Siri about a year before it went on sale, one of the people said. Following successive year-over-year quarterly drops in sales, Cook is looking for new ways to generate revenue for a company that some analysts have said has reached its peak. Apple relies heavily on the iPhone, which accounted for about 66 per cent of its revenue last year, and an iPhone-connected speaker would be another way for the company to boost its smartphone sales via its ecosystem. The Information earlier reported that Apple is working on an Amazon Echo-like speaker, which CNET said would include cameras. While Apple's ability to make high-quality hardware isn't in question, the Siri voice system has failed to meet expectations. Since launching in 2011 with the iPhone 4S, Siri has frequently stumbled with long load times and by misinterpreting information. If the speaker is to thrive in a marketplace dominated by Amazon's advanced Alexa service, Apple needs to improve Siri. Beyond the home device, Apple is researching new ways to improve Siri on iPhones and iPads, two people said. With an initiative code-named "Invisible Hand", Apple hopes to give users the ability to fully control their devices through a Siri command system within three years, one of the people added. Currently, the voice assistant is able to respond to commands within its application, but Apple's goal is for Siri to be able to control the entire system without having to open an app or reactivate Siri. For example, a user would be able to ask their iPhone to open a web page and then share it with a friend without the need to ever launch the Siri interface. Other examples from Apple's current research include being able to print a PDF by speaking "print" while reading it or saying "help" in order for the system to help the user navigate a particular task or application. Apple has also been researching opening this ability to third-party apps, the person said.

More information has surfaced on Microsoft's purported smartphone, with a post on Baidu teasing it runs Windows 10 Mobile Redstone 2, packs the Snapdragon 830 processor, a 5.7-inch 2K display, and a 20MP camera.   The information was posted in May, so many of these specs could have easily changed, and might do so again before its launch in 2017. Microsoft could do well in the smartphone market as it is beginning to get stale on the iPhone side, while Samsung deals with the massive issues stemming from its battery issues on the Galaxy Note 7, losing nearly $40 billion in stock in just a few days.

Advertisement On a moonscaped rise in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, thousands of men and women carve a heavy, off-white mineral away from the hillside with pickaxes, then wash it with shovels in man-made streams and haul it down the hill in 110-pound sacks. They are the sort of independent miners that big companies usually chase away when they get a minerals concession in Africa. Here, the workers instead are the face of a new collaboration that allows miners and company alike to profit -- while proving to companies such as Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. that what they mine doesn’t fund armed conflict. The face of this effort is Ben Mwangachuchu, a 56-year-old University of Notre Dame graduate who came home from Washington, D.C., to try to make it work in a country still torn by factional conflict. It’s a struggle as he copes with low prices and spates of smuggling, he says. But the system is slowly paying off and he’s beginning to reinvest profits in mechanization that will help him improve efficiency and double revenue. "It was the only pragmatic way we could work in this post-conflict environment," said Mwangachuchu, managing director of Societe Miniere de Bisunzu (SMB). On a hot day in late August, he stuck out in a checked blazer and sunglasses, joking easily with miners on the hill in their eclectic assortments of second-hand clothes. Popular Now Who is Killing American Manufacturing? Humility: Your No. 1 Leadership Asset for 2016 What Automotive Needs Right Now: Quality Control, Manufacturing Efficiency The prize is tantalum, a scarce mineral extracted from coltan ore that’s used in Apple’s iPhones and almost every other smartphone on the planet. Tantalum is a key component in precision technologies in aviation, automobile, armaments and electronics, including products made by companies including Samsung and Huawei Technologies Co. Three years ago, Mwangachuchu negotiated an agreement with a cooperative called Cooperamma that allows its diggers to mine parts of the site at Rubaya, northwest of the provincial capital of Goma. The condition: They only sell the mineral to SMB. That allows the company to track the mineral from mine to port, assuring that it’s untainted by conflict. At the time, when Mwangachuchu took over from his brother Edouard after he became a legislator and senator in Kinshasa, the capital, the mine was overrun with independent diggers. SMB could only access small parts of the concession area. Now, SMB finances as many as 5,000 miners when the price is high. Each month, the company pays Cooperamma as much as $5 million for coltan ore; the town at the foot of hill has swollen to 45,000 people. “Cohabitation between informal diggers and industrial mining companies is in everyone’s interest,” Robert Seninga, president of the Cooperamma cooperative, said by phone from Goma. “The agreement is bringing greater economic and physical security to the region.” Congo officially shipped 992 metric tons of coltan in 2015, down 25% from the previous year. More the 80% of that output came from Rubaya, Mwangachuchusaid. The U.S. Geological Survey puts the country’s share of global tantalum production at about 17% . If he could measure the resource, Mwangachuchu said, he’s convinced it would show the biggest deposit of the metal in Africa. It’s a far cry from the near-stoppage of coltan production in Congo in 2010, after the U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act included a requirement for listed companies to disclose their use of four conflict minerals sourced from Congo and adjacent countries. The law was a response to a plethora of reports showing that rebel militias were profiting from coltan mines across Congo, including Rubaya. Mineral-tracing programs slowly encouraged buyers to return. Rubaya was one of the first sites to be declared "conflict-free" by the Congolese government in 2012 and SMB’s coltan is now tagged under a system organized by the Frogmore, U.K.-based International Tin Research Institute. Apple, Huawei and Samsung all said either on their websites or through spokespeople that they and their suppliers only buy minerals mined ethically and in compliance with international guidelines prohibiting conflict minerals in the supply chain. Mwangachuchu’s biggest challenge now is maintaining liquidity in his cash-hungry business. When his buyers pay late, the system seizes up and diggers look to sell elsewhere. He would like a bridging facility, but says Congo’s banking sector hasn’t been helpful. The company is looking for investment to support mechanization, including $1.5 million for a 1.2-megawatt hydro project to power the mine and the surrounding community. To date all investments have been funded by SMB cash. The coltan "is of an incredible quality and is extremely accessible,” Mwangachuchu said as he let a handful of the crumbly white ore fall through his fingers. "This is what has kept us alive." But prices for coltan have been falling for more than a year, squeezing margins for SMB and Cooperamma and encouraging smuggling as diggers seek better prices on the black market. Tantalum prices have fallen about 54% since a peak monthly average of $126.39 per pound in December 2012 to about $58.50 this year, according to Roskill Information Services. Both figures are well short of a record of $350 in the late 1990s. The cooperative model can improve working conditions for diggers, allow for gradual mechanization and should be followed by other companies, said Greg Mthembu-Salter, a former member of the United Nations Group of Experts, who studied Rubaya with the group in 2010 and 2011.  “A mine owner, a cooperative and diggers who were previously at war with each other are now working together,” he said. “That has to be good news. And there are opportunities under this arrangement for improving facilities for diggers, improving health and safety, semi-mechanization and so on.” The challenges are many. SMB estimates it loses as much as 50% of its production to smuggling, despite the tagging process introduced by ITRI. Buyers in neighboring Rwanda purchase as much as 75 tons a month directly from traders who take product from the diggers at Rubaya and tag it as mineral from other sites in either Congo or Rwanda, Mwangachuchu said, over lunch of chicken, rice and stewed beans at SMB’s hilltop headquarters. The cooperative says smuggling only increases if SMB can’t keep up payments for diggers’ production. “Once there is a delay of two or three months without paying and other buyers are ready to inject cash behind our backs, it is difficult to control,” Seninga said.  Mwangachuchu says he hopes further mechanization of his mine will make it easier to regulate output and reduce smuggling. SMB already produces about 15 tons a month industrially and plans to excavate and expand a second part of the mine. Industrially mined coltan will then be crushed and washed in a processing facility that will increase mineral capture by 50% and could also treat the diggers’ production, according to SMB. Seninga is less convinced by mechanization and says informal digging is more profitable at Rubaya than industrial mining. However, the cooperative is preparing for the future by investing in farming and commercial activities that can provide opportunities for diggers if work at SMB ends.  “We know the resource will not last forever,” Seninga said.

A frequent target on passing plays, Vereen was also the team's leading rusher despite two high-profile fumbles in the first three weeks. Rashad Jennings is expected to be the team's main back in Vereen's absence, backed up by the superbly monickered Orleans Darkwa. On defense, cornerbacks Eli Apple and Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie both left the team's home defeat against Washington with injuries. Apple's injury is a hamstring strain, which is likely to keep him sidelined for at least a week or two, while Rodgers-Cromartie suffered a groin strain. Both injuries are particularly significant for cornerbacks, as those muscles are stressed by the position and these types of strain tend to linger for a while after the player returns to the lineup. Chargers Linebacker Manti Te'o -- Achilles (IR) Manti Te'o suffered a torn Achilles tendon against Indianapolis, and will miss the rest of the season. He becomes the third Chargers player to suffer a major injury in three regular season weeks (following Danny Woodhead and Keenan Allen), and his loss could be a major blow to the Chargers defense (20th by total DVOA entering Week 3). Redskins Safety DeAngelo Hall -- Knee (IR) DeAngelo Hall will also be placed on injured reserve today after suffering a torn ACL against the New York Giants. Fellow defensive back Bashaud Breeland has a high ankle sprain and is likely to miss time, with the duration determined by the severity of the sprain, and the severity to be diagnosed by an MRI. Seahawks Halfback Thomas Rawls -- Leg Seahawks Quarterback Russell Wilson -- Knee Thomas Rawls has a hairline fracture of his leg, according to reports today, which is likely to sideline the halfback for a further three to five weeks. With the Seahawks on a bye in Week 5, this may only mean one more missed game for Rawls, but with Christine Michael being productive in his stead the team has little need to rush Rawls back. More significant to the team's immediate future is the knee injury to quarterback Russell Wilson. Already playing on a right high ankle sprain, Wilson suffered a sprained MCL in his left knee against San Francisco. The sprain is relatively mild, so there remains a chance that Wilson could play in Week 4 against the New York Jets, but if he does so it will be with a protective brace. Trevone Boykin replaced Wilson (in part due to the score) against San Francisco, and his performance may encourage the Seahawks to sit their starter against the ferocious Jets defensive line and focus on getting him healthy for Week 6. Other Injuries 49ers cornerback Jimmie Ward suffered an apparent muscle injury on a kickoff coverage play against Seattle, with his quadriceps or hamstring the most likely injured muscles. Either would mean time missed for a cornerback, with a mild strain meaning only a week or two, or a more severe strain meaning around four to six weeks. West coast injury news is usually the last injury news to come out, for obvious reasons, so more news on that is expected later this afternoon. Bears halfback Jeremy Langford reportedly suffered a sprained ankle against Dallas. No word is yet available on how much, if any, time he will miss. Bengals safety Shawn Williams left Sunday's defeat to Denver with a knee injury, but the injury is believed to be minor. Cowboys receiver Dez Bryant suffered a mild knee sprain against Chicago, but returned to the game and is not expected to miss time. An MRI scan today is believed to be precautionary. Dolphins tight end Jordan Cameron left Sunday's game with concussion symptoms and enters the league protocol. He will not pass the protocol in time to play on Thursday night against Cincinnati. Jaguars halfback Chris Ivory suffered both knee and ankle injuries against Baltimore, but was able to finish the game. Ivory had already missed the first two weeks of the season, and his status for the Week 4 visit to London is uncertain. Lions safety Tavon Wilson left Sunday's game with a neck injury, but so far indications are that the injury is not considered severe. Rafael Bush replaced Wilson in the lineup. Packers tight end Jared Cook left Sunday's game on crutches after injuring his right ankle. The injury itself has not been specified, but ESPN's Rob Demovsky reports that the injury is not season-ending. Cook is expected to miss at least one game, but he may be absent longer. Fullback Aaron Ripkowski suffered a back injury, but apparently felt fine after the game. Raiders offensive tackle Menelik Watson left Sunday's game with a reported calf injury and is expected to miss time, though the severity of the injury is not yet known. The Englishman had already been struggling with a groin injury suffered during preseason, and his absence adds to the team's woes at the position with Austin Howard and Matt McCants also injured. Seventh-round rookie Vadal Alexander manned the position after Watson left Sunday's game, and will probably have to do so again if the others can't return. Given that fact, the coaches will be relieved that they only face the 3-0 Ravens in Baltimore next week. Steelers linebacker Lawrence Timmons was taken to hospital for checks on his injured shin during Sunday's blowout loss in Philadelphia, but returned to the stadium before the end of the game and was walking comfortably. No word is yet available on what caused the team doctors to take this very unusual step, or whether Timmons might miss time. Fellow linebackers Ryan Shazier and Jarvis Jones also left Sunday's game, but both were able to return. Safety Robert Golden was not, though, and he is expected to miss time with a hamstring injury. Offensive lineman Ramon Foster left the game with a chest injury, with no update yet public on his status. Vikings guard Alex Boone is scheduled for an MRI scan on his hip injury today, as is tight end David Morgan. No further details are yet available for either.

The early bye week could really be a blessing for the Seahawks and I'll take an out of conference road loss over losing Wilson for significant time. I'm worried that Russell is pounding magic bubble water and will convince the team docs that he's good to go (get pounded by the Jets front 7).

If they keep sticking him out there with injuries, it's going to be a vicious cycle of Wilson getting pounded because he's hobbled and being hobbled because he's been pounded. I definitely agree that they would be wise to let him sit out against the Jets D-line and then heal up in the bye.

Seattle then has Atlanta, who have a non-scary pass rush and then a bye, which should give Wilson time time heal. Or you could feed him to Richardson, Wilkerson and co behind the worst line in the league... Phil Simms is a Cretin.

In a new interview with BuzzFeed News, Apple executives Jimmy Iovine, Zane Lowe, and Bozoma Saint John talk about what they have learned in their first year, the battle for exclusive streaming rights, and more. Iovine explains that his ultimate goal with Apple Music is to make it easier for artists to release good music and for users to have access to good music. “That’s the only thing that we know how to do coming from where we’re coming from,” he said. “You use all the tools you have to do that.“ One thing that Iovine has used to differentiate Apple Music from the competition is exclusive content. Since the service launched, Apple has worked to gain exclusive streaming rights to music from artists like Drake, Britney Spears, Frank Ocean, and others. Apple’s focus on exclusives hasn’t been met with praise from everyone though. Universal Music Group spoke out against the practice last month, saying that it would no longer negotiate for exclusive rights with any service, while artists like Kanye West have also said the practice hurts the music industry as a whole. Iovine, however, says that Apple always holds up its end of the deal when ti comes to relationships, while he also noted that Apple will continue to work out exclusives with other labels like Sony Music Entertainment and Warner Music Group. “We’re feeling our way around and seeing what works … Every time we do [an exclusive], we learn something new.” He added that Apple Music would move forward with its pursuit of exclusives from other partners, such as Sony Music Entertainment and the Warner Music Group, noting, “It’s Apple’s show. As long as Apple’s asking me to do what I’m doing, I’m gonna keep doing it.” Ultimately, Iovine offers the caveat that no one really knows where the music industry will be in a year’s time. “A year from today could look extremely different from what it looks like right now,” he said. For his part, Beats 1 head Zane Lowe explained that Apple Music is becoming a sort of safe space for artists to release their music and announce information. Lowe notes that it’s not just Beats 1 that allows that, but rather all aspects of the service. “I think Apple Music is the place that helps artists tell their stories. It’s where artists can come and feel comfortable,” Lowe said. “And that’s not just on Beats 1, it’s through the releasing of their records, it’s through our editorial, through content, all sorts of ways.” Apple Music head of global consumer marketing Bozoma Saint John explains the thought process that goes into making changes to Apple Music, noting that the biggest question they ask is “How are you actually interacting with your music?” The Apple Music team will then ask itself, “What are you going to it for? How can we better serve that up?” The Music app on iOS recently underwent an overhaul with the launch of iOS 10 and Iovine explains that many of the changes build upon – or in some instances subtract from – what was first introduced. As for the future, Iovine teases that the team is working on stuff that no one is going to expect. “We were too ambitious in the beginning — we probably put too much into it,” said Iovine. “But we’re getting there now, one foot in front of the other, and the stuff we’re creating I don’t think anyone is gonna see coming.” The full piece can be read here.

Idaho Business Health Nation/World Elections Photos Business ‘Pokemon Go’ fervor has cooled, but the game isn’t dead yet MONDAY, SEPT. 26, 2016, 4:17 P.M. “Pokemon Go” players begin a group walk along the Embarcadero in San Francisco on July 20. “Pokemon Go” was an instant hit, but as the hype subsides, it will have to evolve to keep people playing. (Marcio Jose Sanchez / Associated Press) By Mae Anderson Associated Press Twitter Facebook  Email  Reddit  SMS NEW YORK – Does “Pokemon Go” have a second act? The mobile phone app was an instant hit when it debuted in July. At an Apple event on Sept. 7, Niantic CEO John Hanke said 500 million people had downloaded the game in just two months. It was the first mobile game to go mainstream in a big way since “Candy Crush” in 2014 or “Angry Birds” in 2012. It was also the first to incorporate augmented reality, a blending of the real and virtual worlds. But the buzz has decidedly cooled. Last Tuesday, the game ended its reign as the top-grossing U.S. iPhone app after 74 days on top, replaced by “Clash Royale,” a battling game, according to research firm Sensor Tower. Twitter mentions of the game peaked at 1.7 million on July 11, five days after its launch, according to Adobe Digital Insights. That number had fallen by 98 percent, to 131,000, by Sept. 7, when Apple featured it. Was it all a summer fever dream? While experts say the game is likely to remain popular for a while, it needs to evolve to have real staying power – just like its namesake digital creatures. “Almost anything of this sort is a fad,” says Steve Jones, a communications professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago. “I think we’ve seen the tapering off.” Of course, an enormous number of people still play the game. Research firm App Annie estimates 1 in 10 smartphone owners in the U.S. are playing; in Japan, that number is 1 in 4. Those U.S. figures are half what App Annie saw the week after the game launched – but to put them in perspective, they still reflect roughly the same user interest as Twitter or Pinterest. “Pokemon Go” has also been good at keeping people playing after signing up. Its 30-day retention rate is the second best on the Google Play store – behind “Words with Friends,” but ahead of other popular games such as “Clash of Clans” and “Clash Royale.” “For a gaming app to be as big as a social network is unprecedented,” said Fabien-Pierre Nicolas, a spokesman at App Annie. “Right now, yes, they’re losing a million players every week. But they get a million new players every week.” The longer users interact with the game, the more time a company has to figure out how to get money from them, Nicolas said. It took a year for some successful games like “Clash of Clans,” “Puzzle” and “Dragon” to earn revenue of $1 billion, but “Pokemon Go” has already made more than $500 million in revenue in two months alone, according to App Annie. The game is free, but lets users purchase items in the game. But with social chatter dying down and a new smartphone game based on a beloved 1990s character – “Super Mario Run” – hitting app stores in December, Pokemon will have to reinvent itself. Kari Amarosso, a public relations manager at Arizona State University, started playing “Pokemon Go” with her 19-year-old son as a fun mother-son summer activity sparked by 1990s Pokemon-card nostalgia. They’d go to the mall or to meetups like one in Tempe, Arizona, where thousands of people walked around Tempe Town Lake capturing digital monsters. But the allure wore off after about six weeks, she said. “I lost interest or just plain forgot to play,” she says – and her son has stopped as well. “His route doesn’t change much from work, to home, and he lost interest,” she says. Niantic has been trying to freshen things up. In September it introduced a “buddy” system, allowing users to pair up with a Pokemon to scoop up game currency called “candy.” It has also debuted an Apple Watch app and introduced a $35 wearable device, Pokemon Go Plus, which lights up and vibrates when you’re near a Pokestop or a newly appeared Pokemon. Jones suggests the company needs to do more to keep people interested – for example, by adding some kind of social element so that players can interact with each other. His two teenage sons, he notes, have grown slightly less enchanted with the game. “Young people are used to doing social media and there isn’t really messaging as part of the game,” Jones said. There have been persistent rumors that Niantic plans to let players trade captured Pokemon with one another, although the company hasn’t commented on that. The big challenge for “Pokemon Go” is to avoid the fate of “Candy Crush,” says Pace University marketing professor Larry Chiagouris. Created by King Digital, “Candy Crush” because a smash hit; Activision Blizzard subsequently bought King for $5.9 billion. But while people still play the game, the fervor around it has died down. When the game was at its peak, “you were getting invited to play Candy Crush every day” on Facebook, he said. “You don’t get too many invitations to play Candy Crush anymore.” Published: Sept. 26, 2016, 4:17 p.m.  Tags: mobile games, Pokemon, Pokemon Go Click here to comment on this story » ​ Follow the Spokesman wherever you are: Facebook Twitter Newsletter Subscribe Print edition home delivery Help Customer Service Sitemap Directory Subscriber Services Classifieds Classifieds Advertising Obituaries More Staff Cowles Jobs Archives/Research Buy photo reprints Jumble Crossword Horoscopes Contact Us Downtown Spokane 999 W Riverside Ave Spokane, Wa 99201 Mailing Address P.O.

Vitality has signed a deal with the technology giant Apple that it hopes will tap into Britons’ growing taste for tracking their own movements and nutrition through wearable gadgets. While the health benefits of such self-monitoring are still being debated, the popularity of wearable devices such as Fitbits is soaring. Over 3m wrist-worn smart devices were sold in the UK in 2015, according to Mintel, more than doubling in a year despite 51pc of Britons expressing doubts that wearable technology would change their daily routines. Vitality plans to sign up its insurance customers to an Apple Watch for a deeply-discounted £69 each with the proviso that they “earn” the rest of the £369 purchase price by reaching exercise goals over a 24 month period.  To avoid a penalty charge, users must walk at least 10,000 steps every day, or undertake more vigorous exercise on 20 days a month. The Apple Watch 2 was unveiled earlier this month Credit: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg Customers who decide to lend their watch to someone more active to fulfil their quota could be accused of insurance fraud. “It’s like telling the insurer you’ve got a two-bed house, and then when it burns down it turns out it had six bedrooms. At the very least it’s enough to invalidate your claim,” said Andrew Kail, UK financial services leader at PwC. “Individuals who want to take advantage of this probably think they can get a better deal and expect to benefit. But it’s a different story if they’re going to put your premiums up. You start to get different levels of insurance risk – you see that in telematics for drivers who allow insurers to access their driving data." A spokeswoman for Vitality said “the vast majority” of its existing customers who log their activity to earn rewards do so within the rules. “There are always going to be a few people who try to cheat any type of system.  However, our experience is that abuse of the Vitality Active Rewards benefit is very rare and we monitor it to ensure that a few people do not spoil it for the majority,” she said. Apple, which is hoping to revive sales of its watches with the recently-launched Apple Watch 2, is building on a partnership it signed last year with Vitality’s South African parent company Discovery. The popularity of the Fitbit wristband made its maker one of the most hotly-anticipated floats of last year - although stiff competition has weighed on the shares ever since Credit: Michael Nagle/Bloomberg “The relationship with Apple is symbiotic. We can’t develop the technology at the rate they do, and I’m not sure they would have the requisite understanding of the insurance risk,” said Vitality chief executive Neville Koopowitz. Several technology firms including Google have previously tried to harness their wealth of personal data to challenge traditional insurers, although Mr Koopowitz sees the overlap as more of an opportunity than a threat.  “One can’t say they would never enter the marketplace, but it’s a complex field,” he said. Vitality has also penned a deal with Ocado to offer online discounts of up to 25pc on goods that the two firms pick out as healthy, in an attempt to steer customers into more virtuous shopping habits - and eventually lead to lower health insurance claims. “What we have come to realise is we’ve seen people changing their eating behaviour if they get discounts. There’s a perception that healthy eating is expensive and that’s a barrier, as is impulse purchasing," said Mr Koopowitz.

Despite the outrage over Apple's wireless EarPods and allegations from employees that the company culture is toxic, the brand has once again been voted as the the coolest on offer by UK shoppers and trendsetters. The annual research asked 2500 British consumers and a panel of 36 key influencers including blogger Ella Mills (of Deliciously Ella fame), fashion designer Amanda Wakeley, and editors from tiles like TechRadar and InStyle along with Mobo founder Kanya King to rank the coolest brands. Companies were placed across four categories: authenticity, desirability, innovation and originality. As with the 2015 CoolBrands list, digital brands like Netflix and Instagram have surfaced as strong challengers to Apple's crown, with the online streaming service moving up two places to claim the third spot, while Facebook's image-sharing platform rose one space to number six. Elsewhere, Spotify broke into the top ten this year, placing at number seven. The shakedown of the rankings shows that consumers now deem brands to be 'cool' when they are accessible and low-cost, but also offer access to a wealth of content. Having narrowly missed out on a Top 20 position in 2015, young innovator Airbnb, which was recently valued at $30bn, has scooped 12th place this year. Another new entrant is action camera company GoPro which has edged at at number 18. Sports brands were prominent in the top 10, with Nike and Adidas both highly rated by shoppers and influencers. Researchers believe this this is partly down to the fact that big names in the space have been increasingly turning to influencers to front their campaigns, coupled with the 'wellness' trend. Interestingly, high-end fashion labels have taken a dip this year, with notable fallers including Alexander McQueen which has gone down seven places, and Chanel which has tumbled to number 19. M.A.C, however, entered the top 20 for the first time which could be down to celebrity partnerships, such as the line it has released with Caitlyn Jenner. "While Apple is still perceived by influencers and the public alike to be the UK’s coolest brand, a concerted wave of fast-growing, entrepreneurial businesses are building momentum to seriously challenge its position," said Stephen Cheliotis, chairman of the CoolBrands Council. "Disruptive brands like Netflix, Spotify, Instagram, Airbnb and GoPro (proving Apple no longer has a monopoly on cool tech) continue to boost their credentials, consolidating their positions by either moving further up the Top 20 or entering for the first time.These rising stars have hit a sweet pot, retaining a positive reputation with influencers, while building their awareness and lustre among consumers. "These challenger brands are utilising new technologies, new business models and new ways of thinking, while remaining accessible and useful; conversely many premium brands are falling, as evidenced by the significant drop in performance of the luxury fashion brands surveyed."

There is one important piece of the puzzle that he thinks Wall Street has mostly ignored that explains the bounce. Apple's chief rival, Samsung, was caught in a debacle for its Galaxy Note 7 phones, after it was discovered that the batteries could overheat and cause the phone to explode. Samsung's newest smartphone has now been recalled in the U.S., and the Federal Aviation Administration issued a warning as a potential safety hazard. "This opens the door for Apple to take back a potentially enormous amount of market share," the host of CNBC's "Mad Money" said. For customers who want a high-end smartphone, the main choices are an Apple iPhone or Samsung Galaxy. And now that Samsung's phones have the possibility to explode, it is this dynamic that Cramer thinks is helping to fuel Apple's stock higher. He was inspired by Jack Mohr from TheStreet to take a closer look at the Apple-Samsung dynamic. "Considering the damage it has done to Samsung's brand, I bet there could be a lot more upside here," Cramer said. Mikael Dubois | Getty Images "You may read about how few people ever switch smartphone allegiances, but I believe this is a game-changer." -Jim Cramer South Korean electronics conglomerate Samsung has been nipping at Apple's heels for quite some time. Finally in the second quarter, it seemed that it was finally catching up when Samsung's market share increased to 35 percent while Apple's dropped more than 9 percentage points to 50 percent. In an effort to get ahead, Samsung expedited the launch of the Galaxy Note 7 and shortened its release date by 10 days and added 10 new features, while dismissing concerns from suppliers that it could cause problems. The smartphones came out with generally positive reviews in August, but just two weeks later, Samsung issued a global recall after discovering instances where the phone caught on fire while charging. Thus, because Samsung rushed to release its new product, it sacrificed safety for more speed, features and processing power, Cramer said. Unlike Samsung, Apple is willing to take its time by rolling out new features over time. It improves the iPhone methodically, one iteration at a time. Even more important, Apple now has an opportunity to take market share right now, Cramer said. The Samsung Galaxy was the only high-end smartphone that ever came close to the iPhone. Cramer believes that a significant amount of Samsung users will switch to Apple. "You may read about how few people ever switch smartphone allegiances, but I believe this is a game-changer," Cramer said. Apple's iPhone 7 customers derive from three places: existing Apple users that upgrade, regular phone users that switch to a smartphone, and from competitors like Samsung. Cramer thinks the first group won't change, but the users who migrate to a smartphone could go with Apple in a big way. Cramer always tells investors that competition is the enemy to profits. Now that Cramer says Apple's main smartphone rival has basically taken itself out of the competition, he now expects the iPhone 7 to be the best-selling iteration yet. Ultimately, Samsung's smartphone debacle didn't come out of nowhere, Cramer said. The company got too ambitious in an effort to kick Apple while it was down. Instead, Samsung's customers and brand have suffered, and it no longer has a product that can compete with the new iPhone. "Once again, Apple's patience pays off; still one more reason why I say you should own this stock, not trade it."

Gadgets McApple: Apple Car comes another step closer to reality By Daniel Jeffrey 26 Sep 16 Facebook 6 Twitter      You’ve just updated your phone, Watch and everything else Apple-related, but could it soon be time to update your car? Reports have been emerging over the lasts couple of days claiming the Cupertino tech giant is in talks to buy McLaren Applied Technologies, the British auto company known best for its Formula 1 cars. The rumoured takeover was valued somewhere between $USD1.3 and $USD2 billion, and the acquisition certainly wouldn’t be a money-maker for Apple – McLaren made around $7 million in revenue in 2015. It would, however, definitely help Apple with a project in the vein of, say, a driverless car. If Apple does end up buying McLaren, it'd be interesting to see them do a pitstop without a jack. — Grace Wilkinson (@Grace_Wilko) September 21, 2016 Guess future McLaren cars will be missing windows then. #F1 #Apple — Badger GP (@BadgerGP) September 21, 2016 Apple’s super-secret car project isn’t too much of a secret these days. Although we don’t know exactly what it entails, we do know the company recently decided to direct the attention of one of their long-term executives, Bob Mansfield, towards their auto division. More recently, a bunch of their staff who were working on the project were asked to pack their bags. A partnership with McLaren would benefit Apple on a number of fronts, the obvious one being the British company knows how to make cars, saving Tim Cook from having to hire a stack of engineers, mechanics and other automotive staff. McLaren has also been a pioneer of sorts, having created the first carbon-fibre F1 and road cars. Now, all of McLaren’s models are based on a carbon-fibre chassis. They also know their way around electric cars, having developed a super-fancy system to power their P1 hybrid model. Another major carrot is McLaren’s Vehicle Dynamics Simulator (VDS), which would allow Apple to run plenty of tests away from the prying eyes who want a sneak-peak of anything and everything the company does. McLaren denied the reports, the first of which came courtesy of the Financial Times. But in a subsequent piece by the New York Times, the company admitted they have been talking to Apple, so who knows what’s actually going on? But there’s no doubt a partnership between the two innovation-savvy behemoths is an enticing prospect, if for no other reason than we’d get to say ‘McApple’ a lot.

Email | 26 Sep 2016 | Print  ExtraBITS for 26 September 2016 by TidBITS Staff In ExtraBITS this week, we offer a few Apple-specific ways to watch tonight’s presidential debate, or maybe a nice peaceful football game. Apple is working on a fix for a security flaw in iOS 10, while Yahoo is dealing with the theft of data associated with 500 million accounts — ouch! Finally, we note Dejal’s 25th year of Mac development. How to Watch the Presidential Debate on Your Apple Devices -- The first U.S. presidential debate will air tonight, 26 September 2016 at 9 PM EDT. Ben Lovejoy of 9to5Mac has compiled a partial list of the many apps and Web sites that will let you watch live, for free. In addition, as we expand upon below, Sling TV is offering a free preview today, which will carry the debate. Read/post comments Sling TV Offers Free Preview for Presidential Debate -- Streaming cable alternative Sling TV is offering a free preview of its Sling Orange service from 8 AM EDT on 26 September 2016 until 2 AM EDT on 27 September 2016. The ostensible reason for the preview is to enable cord-cutters to watch the first U.S. presidential debate and the Atlanta-New Orleans game of Monday Night Football, but you can enjoy full access to the 25+ channels included in the Sling Orange service during that time. Signing up for the free preview requires only a username and password, not payment information. You’ll undoubtedly hear from Sling TV afterward, but you should be able to unsubscribe from promotional mailings at that point. Sling TV offers apps for macOS, iOS, and tvOS. Read/post comments Apple to Fix iOS 10 Security Flaw with iTunes Backups -- Russian security company Elcomsoft has discovered a major security flaw in iOS 10: encrypted iTunes backups made with iOS 10 allow password-cracking tools to make 6 million attempts per second, more than 40 times faster than with backups created with iOS 9. Apple has confirmed that the issue is real and plans to fix it in an upcoming security update. In the meantime, because the vulnerability could be exploited only by someone with access to your iTunes backups, Apple recommends a strong login password and using FileVault encryption. (The problem also affects backups made in iTunes for Windows.) iCloud backups are immune to the problem, so if you’re concerned about the security of your iTunes backups, you might consider switching them to iCloud. Read/post comments 500 Million Yahoo Accounts Stolen -- Yahoo has announced that information associated with at least 500 million user accounts has been stolen by what the company believes is a state-sponsored actor. If you have a Yahoo account, you should change your password immediately and enable two-step verification. In addition, if you use Yahoo as your primary email provider, you should change the passwords for any online account tied to your Yahoo email address, since the thieves could have used password resets to gain access to those accounts as well. More so than any other recent example, this breach shows the importance of using a password manager like 1Password or LastPass to create and enter a separate strong random password for every site. Read/post comments Dejal Marks 25 Years of Mac Development -- Congrats to David Sinclair of Dejal, who is celebrating his Mac development company’s 25th anniversary (check out the photo of his original Mac Plus!). Dejal is perhaps best known for its Simon monitoring tool, but the company also makes the free Time Out break reminder app, along with the Caboodle snippet keeper, and the BlogAssist utility for simplifying the process of making HTML markup. Through the end of the month, Dejal is offering a 50 percent discount on all its products. Read/post comments   READERS LIKE YOU! Support TidBITS by becoming a member today!

The call will be held at the standard time of 2PM PT/5PM ET, with the earnings release itself being sent out roughly thirty minutes before then. This earnings call will be an important one for Apple and investors alike as it will provide the first look yet at early sales of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. While Apple generally offers first weekend numbers, the company said this year that it wouldn’t due to the supply contrasts surrounding the new devices. Many analysts, including KGI, expect that Apple will report slower iPhone 7 sales than it did iPhone 6s sales at this time last year, despite increased popularity of the iPhone 7 Plus and the Jet Black color. Last quarter, Apple reported revenue of $42.4 billion on sales of 40.4 million iPhones, 9.9 million iPads, and 4.2 million Macs. Below is the guidance Apple provided for its 2016 fiscal fourth quarter: revenue between $45.5 billion and $47.5 billion gross margin between 37.5 percent and 38 percent operating expenses between $6.05 billion and $6.15 billion other income/(expense) of $350 million tax rate of 25.5 percent The live broadcast of the call will be available on Apple’s website and of course we will have live coverage, as well. The call will feature questions from the press and investors for Apple executives. Guides AAPL Company Breaking news from Cupertino.

SiliconValley.com Twitter Facebook Google+ RSS   Social Web Mobile Cloud Gadgets Cleantech VC Data Games Policy Media   Apple has technology to stop texting-and-driving, but doesn’t: report By Ethan Baron / September 26, 2016 at 2:07 PM Attention, commuters habitually stuck in horrendous traffic caused by people looking at their phones instead of the road: Apple is here to save you. Well, actually not. But it appears that Apple could save you, if it wanted to. But it doesn’t want to. Not even when the problem goes far beyond soul-consuming traffic, and into the realms of catastrophic injury and death. Other companies, like Apple, could prevent people from using phones dangerously while driving, but they don’t do it, either, according to a new report in the New York Times. The paper referred in a recent article to an Apple patent highlighted in a lawsuit related to a double-fatal crash in Texas in which the driver was allegedly distracted by her phone. Apple is being sued by the victims’ families, who claim Apple knew its phones would be used for text messaging, but didn’t stop the driver in the crash from doing so, according to the Times. “The company has a patent for technology designed to prevent texting while driving, but it has not deployed it,” the article said. That patent, for “lock-out mechanisms,” was granted in 2014, with Apple casting itself in the role of superhero (though, to date, it appears the firm has neglected to don its cape). “Texting while driving has become so widespread it is doubtful that law enforcement will have any significant effect on stopping the practice,” the patent said, before patting itself on the back. “An opportunity exists for handheld computing device makers to put into place a lock-out mechanism to disable the input and, possibly, the reception of text messages while the user is driving. The achievement of such a mechanism may be a significant selling point in the eyes of concerned parents, and it could lead to legislation that would require all handheld computing devices to disable texting while driving.” The invention, according to the patent, should enable all distracting functions to be disabled on a driver’s phone, including making or receiving phone calls without a hands-free device. Motion sensors and phone cameras could be used to identify when a person is in a moving car, and when they’re in the driver’s seat, according to the patent. Whether Apple has acted on the patent is unclear. SiliconBeat has asked the company to discuss the matter but received no immediate response. The Times suggested that wireless-services providers could also stop texting-and-driving if they wished to. “Apple, Verizon, AT&T and other companies caution about the risks of distracted driving — and they acknowledge that laws and public education aimed at curbing the behavior are not working,” the article said. “But the companies — though they offer manual ways to shut down texting on the road — do not deploy technology that takes the decision out of drivers’ hands altogether.” That reluctance to act may be rooted in competitive realities. “If you’re at Apple or you’re at Samsung, do you want to be the first to block texting-and-driving?” David Teater, a former director at the National Safety Council, told the Times. “A customer might say, ‘If Apple does it, then my next phone is a Samsung.’” But Teater, whose son was killed at age 12 by a driver on a cell phone, believes human lives trump competitivity. “If Apple had deployed this technology 10 years ago, there would be more people alive today,” he told the paper. “Think about it from a parent’s perspective: How would you feel knowing Apple had the ability to prevent your teen from ever texting and driving, and they chose not to?”   Photo: Bonnye Spray, left, Rena Lepard, and David Aaronson talk about the lethal effects of distracted driving, during a presentation at Downey High School. Spray lost her daughter Amanda in 2007 when she crashed on Interstate 5 while using her cell phone.

The earnings report will be an exciting one, as it will provide a look at early iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus sales. Apple has declined to release launch weekend sales for the two devices, making it difficult to determine how well the new phones have sold compared to the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus. For the third quarter of 2016, Apple posted revenue of $42.5 billion and net quarterly profit of $7.8 billion, or $1.42 per diluted share. That was down from $49.6 billion in revenue, $10.7 billion in net quarterly profit, and $1.85 per diluted share in the year-ago quarter. Apple's guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 includes expected revenue of $45.5 to $47.5 billion and gross margin between 37.5 and 38 percent, well below the revenue of $51.5 billion it saw in 4Q 2015. Apple will release its quarterly earnings statement at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time (4:30 p.m. Eastern Time), with a conference call to follow at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time (5:00 pm. Eastern Time). MacRumors will provide live coverage of the results and the call. 27 comments Top Rated Comments (View all) ILuvEggplant 14 weeks ago Let me guess Tim You can't comment on actual sales numbers but find you've received great enthusiasm from your customers and they love the iphone 7. Rating: 8 Votes Abazigal 14 weeks ago This is Apple's speciality now, profit reporting, not making great products but selling any product. Case in point, look at the sheer number of variations you can have Apple products in. iPhone SE (3 year old design with 3 colours and 2 storage options) iPhone 6s (same again) iPhone 6s Plus (same again) Now you can have: iPhone 7 (5 COLOURS - really be individual like the millions of other customers that bought it, even though you'll have to put a case on it because we haven't design it properly) Also added a 256gb option and we'll overcharge for this. Simply because you cannot have the option to put in a £20 SD card. iPhone 7 plus (same story) The iPad line up is just as convuluted. Meanwhile the Mac lineup dwindles into the abyss. And what do you think the profits represent, if not a representation of Apple making great products and consumers being willing to shell out the premium for them? Rating: 4 Votes Exile714 14 weeks ago Q3** earnings. Not Q4. Fiscal, not calendar. Rating: 4 Votes Exile714 14 weeks ago I think it's a good assumption Apple will release all their new products before earnings. So, if earnings is 10/27, then an event 10/24 is out of the question because it's too close (also, its a Monday). We could have one 10/4, but that's highly doubtful given we've passed the invite range. More likely is 10/12 (a Wednesday because of Columbus Day holiday in the US), or 10/18. If 10/18, and if it follows iPhone pre-order dates, we would have pre-orders on 10/21 for release on 10/28... one day after the earnings event. So I'm putting my money on a 10/12 event. I know it's a lot of assumptions, but that's my guess and I'll stick to it until next week when/if it's proven wrong.

McDonald's sells lord knows how many burgers a day, do you consider it to be gourmet dining? Apple is trying to sell the same product in different iterations. New colours, new storage options or small tweaks, etc. It's not good enough. Mac Donald's moves tons of burgers every day because of their comparatively low prices. Apple sells a ton of hardware despite the premium pricing that they command over the rest of the competition. So Apple has both quality and quantity on their side.

PC-Tablet Videos Tech Apps Telecom Science Business Social Auto Reviews How-To’s Featured Apple iPhone 8 release date, price, renders: iPhone 2017 to have Apple Watch inspired Ceramic frame By Anand Narayanaswamy - 26/09/2016 According to sources, the new forthcoming iPhone 8 renders which surfaced on the web hint at possible Galaxy S7 Edge like display and Apple Watch inspired ceramic frame. With the launch of iPhone 7 in various countries and more to come including India on October 7, all eyes have turned to the rumors surrounding iPhone 8. The renders are part of a concept design drawn by Veniamin Geskin. He took his own time to create an exact image of how the iPhone 8 will look like from his idea. His concept render is amazing, and Apple fans loved it. His design reveals the fact that the Cupertino-based tech giant could return to being the design spearhead it once was. iPhone 8. Jet White & Jet Black. pic.twitter.com/qh0y9zBxSa — Veniamin Geskin (@VenyaGeskin1) September 25, 2016 New iPhone 8 render based on popular theories The main idea which Geskin adopted while drawing the renders is that he mixed some popular theories about the upcoming iPhone. The upcoming smartphone is inspired by the design of the highly successful Samsung Galaxy Note 7 and Galaxy S7 Edge. However, it lacks the purported full-screen display that few rumors dubbed. iPhone 8/iPhone 2017 to ship with ceramic frame Based on rumors, the iPhone 8 might ship with a ceramic frame. Interesting, the material got rave reviews among tech enthusiasts and customers in the Apple Watch Edition Series 2. Since the company’s ceramic design was well accepted by the community, it’s almost sure that Apple will incorporate it in the iPhone 8. What do you think? iPhone 8 Plus – same screen , smaller body. Jet White. Virtual Home Button. Edge QHD Display. Flat Camera. pic.twitter.com/7ToWdYTAmR — Veniamin Geskin (@VenyaGeskin1) September 25, 2016 We can confirm that Apple will modify the material in iPhone 2017 because of rapid complaints regarding the inferior quality rear panel used in iPhone 7. According to Gadget and Gizmos, the jet black variant of iPhone 7 is highly prone to scratches. In fact, Apple had issued a statement, which prompts customers to handle the handset carefully. iPhone 8/iPhone 2017 to offer wireless charging Talking about features, iPhone 8 will feature wireless charging capability, which makes the device slimmer than the previous counterparts. The form factor of iPhone 8 will be changed to a large extent, and it would convert into a super-slim phone. If you carefully verify the iPhone render, you can see that it carries a curved display. In fact, tech pundits have rumored about the possible curved display few months itself. Apple A11 to be integrated with iPhone 8 Even though Apple has to go a long way for iPhone 2017, the initial renders and impressions sound very promising. You can expect the integration of Apple A11 processor into the upcoming iPhone. As per source, the A11 chipset will consume 50 percent less energy than Apple A10 processor in iPhone 7. iPhone 8 to bear Iris scanner and OLED display There are also rumors that iPhone 8 will ship with facial or iris scanning facility for enhanced security. Apple should include iris scanning because of the failure of Samsung Galaxy Note 7 so that the company can take advantage. On the display front, you can expect the integration of OLED display. According to latest reports, insiders from the manufacturing unit revealed the fact that Samsung will supply 40 million AMOLED display units to Apple in 2017. Hence, you can expect reduced thickness than the currently available IPS LED displays. There are reports that iPhone 2017 will ship in three variants. Out of the three models, one of the handsets will feature a curved display. Anyway, you can expect premium iPhone 8 in 2017 because of the 10th-anniversary celebrations.

No Thanks Yes Please Home «Back OECD official says EU Apple ruling not precedent for future tax cases Reuters | DUBLIN Sep 27, 2016 01:11 AM IST DUBLIN (Reuters) - A multi-billion euro back tax bill handed to Apple by the European Commission should not be seen as a precedent for future tax cases as it was based on state aid rather than tax law, the OECD official spearheading global tax reform said on Monday. European Union antitrust regulators last month ordered Apple to pay up to 13 billion euros ($14.6 billion) in back taxes to the Irish government after ruling that a special scheme to route profits through Ireland constituted illegal state aid. Pascal Saint-Amans, who is leading the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's flagship Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project, said that under the new OECD rules, most of the tax from U.S. technology multinationals like Apple should be due in the United States, not Ireland. "(In) transfer pricing (terms), the bulk of the profit clearly belongs to the United States" rather than Ireland or any other European country, Saint-Amans told journalists in Dublin. Transfer pricing, the setting of prices for the transfer of goods or services from one subsidiary to another which critics say is used to reduce tax liabilities in relatively high-tax countries, is a key target of the BEPS process. "My understanding is that the (EU) decision is based on a certain form of legalistic state-aid reasoning which is specific to the state-aid investigation. It is not a transfer pricing case," he said. "What is extremely important is that these rules, these standards, be implemented consistently by everybody and that the state-aid cases do not undermine the standard, in particular, on transfer pricing rules," he said. Saint-Amans repeatedly said he could not comment on the merits of the Apple case as the commission has not yet published its full decision and because he was not an expert in EU anti-competition law. Saint-Amans said Apple's tax planning in the period studied by the EU, which he described earlier this month as "outrageous", would not be possible under the BEPS rules. But he said there was possible "friction" between EU anti-competition cases and global efforts to harmonise the taxation of corporations under BEPS. "What is happening with the commission decisions is that you have a picture of the past emerging as we are looking forward, and that makes things complicated," he said. The EU back tax bill was for the years 2003 to 2014 and referred to Irish tax rulings handed to Apple in 1991 and 2007. Saint-Amans said he was hopeful that the Commission would make clear that its rulings did not contradict the BEPS guidelines when it publishes the Apple ruling in full. Apple's Chief Executive Tim Cook has described the European Commission's ruling as "total political crap", while France and Germany have both backed Brussels on the decision.

The professional looking video which has received nearly 10 million views in less than a week has caused havoc with iPhone owners across the world, as many are assumed to have fell victim to this social media trick. YouTube user Taras Maksimuk of TechRax seems to have tricked many people into believing the headphone jack can still be found on the phone, if you drill a 3.5mm hole into the space which is now occupied by the iPhone’s speakers. The video shows Maksimuk putting his new iPhone 7 into a vice before taking to the phone with a power drill and then “proving” his technique works by playing music after plugging in his headphones. The Californian based YouTuber is well known for ‘Technological Pranks’ in which he ‘destroys technology for the pleasure of others’. His other video’s include ‘Can the iPhone 7 survive in liquid nitrogen for 5 minutes?’ and ‘What happens if you microwave an iPhone 7.’ Watch: Inside the new Apple store in Birmingham The iPhone is the first edition of Apple’s smartphone which doesn’t feature the 3.5mm headphone jack, causing outrage of its own after the phone’s reveal on September 7. Despite having a 3.5mm jack adapter with the phone at purchase, many seemed to have gone through with the handset ending DIY. AppleCare, the insuring company for iPhone’s, has said they will not cover drilled holes into their gadgets, leaving owners up to £800 out of pocket if they choose to fall for the trick played by Maksimuk. The comments section of the ‘Secret hack to get headphone jack on the iPhone 7’ video, makes quite an entertaining read, littered with comments from people who claim to have attempted the YouTuber’s technique. YouTube user peanutsz, is one who has claimed Maksimuk’s video has lead him to destroy his mothers iPhone: “I DID THIS TO MY MOM’S PHONE AND IT BROKE! SHE HAS IMPORTANT BUSINESS ON HER PHONE AND NOW SHE’S GONNA SUE YOU!!! STUPID A******” Another user, Some Dude, said: “WTF??? F*** you! My screen turned black the moment I started drilling and now I can’t even open it.” iPhone 7 Plus and jet black iPhone 7 sold out to pre-order customers User SuperWhitelizard has some strong wishes towards Maksimuk after apparently performing the act on his phone too: “You b******! Because of you, my new iPhone is broken now! You are such a terrible human being, I lost so much money believing your video! I hope karma finds you and you go to hell!” The prank is the latest in a long line of iPhone user ‘trolls’ which has seen software and hardware ending results. Did you know the Birmingham Mail has a FREE app for your iPhone? Stay up to date with all things Birmingham. 1. iOS 7 update will make your phone waterproof. Many fell for believing that a software update would turn the iPhone itself waterproof, again, this wasn’t covered by AppleCare once people dropped their phone into a bucket of water. 2. Microwaving your iPhone 6 will extend your battery life. Another iPhone ending prank which saw people put their iPhone into a microwave with hope it would extend their battery life. 3. crashsafari.com Not an iPhone ending joke, but crashed a many people’s iPhone’s back in January. Social media links hiding the URL crashsafari.com would crash people’s iPhone’s after making them exit their Facebook or Twitter app and redirecting them to Safari, Users would have to turn their handset off before regaining control of their phones. 4. Happy New Year, 1970. A software ending bug which caused havoc again in early 2016. Setting an iPhone’s date to January 1, 1970. The date and time change would send the software into a ‘brick’ state. The iPhone would crash rendering it completely unusable and requiring a full factory reset from Apple, losing all the data on the iPhone. 5. AppDestory for iOS Installing this App through the App Store claimed users would be able to cut their iPhones with a knife and it wouldn’t leave a scratch. Needless to say, those who underwent the kitchen-knife surgery on their phone had damaged handsets which were refused repair by the end of it. Have you got an iPhone 7? What do you think of it?

Amaturo; More On: new york giants Giants-Packers Part 3: Because this was too perfect not to happen How Ben McAdoo helped create the monster he must stop McAdoo stunned when asked if partiers would be punished Giants stars' crazy party with Bieber before playoffs begin The Giants have an extra day this week to rest and prepare before they play next Monday night against the Vikings in Minneapolis. That additional time likely will not be enough to cure the physical issues in their defensive backfield. Cornerback Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie played only 32 of the 71 defensive snaps against the Redskins before leaving with a strained groin and, judging from the way he was moving around after the game, he will be out a few weeks. Do not figure to see rookies Eli Apple and Darian Thompson on the field to face the Vikings either. Apple has a strained hamstring, and those do not heal in a matter of days. Thompson is dealing with a left foot issue, and the feeling is he will not be ready to return this week. A source with knowledge of Thompson’s injury told The Post there is not much concern about a long-term absence for Thompson, and a visit to see specialist Dr. Robert Anderson in Charlotte, N.C., on Monday was more about due diligence than worry about extensive damage. That visit assured Thompson there is no significant injury, and he should be back in a matter of weeks. The Giants confirmed Thompson does not need surgery. “It’s early in the week … we’re going to give them a chance to get healthy,’’ coach Ben McAdoo said of Apple and Rodgers-Cromartie. “We aren’t going to rule anyone out right now. Either of those two guys, we’ll give them a chance to get out there and get healthy.’’ Without three of their top defensive backs, the Giants are going to have to rely even more heavily on veteran Leon Hall, who has been an important and versatile addition but could be over-extended if his snaps increase dramatically. After two games, the Giants had an NFL-low seven penalties called against them. They had 11 penalties for 128 yards in the 29-27 loss to the Redskins. “Five of the penalties were of the 15-yard variety, which there is no excuse for,’’ McAdoo said. The Giants also had three turnovers. “When we’re not disciplined and poised, that’s a reflection on me,’’ McAdoo said. “I need to make sure that doesn’t happen.’’ In his second career NFL start, Bobby Hart played all 67 offensive snaps at right tackle and held his own against a rugged player, Ryan Kerrigan. “He battled and competed,’’ McAdoo said. “It definitely wasn’t too big for him. He has a couple things he needs to clean up. That sack, maybe a hit there.’’ McAdoo on center Weston Richburg’s ejection after two unsportsmanlike conduct penalties: “It’s disappointing to see Weston get thrown out of the game. We knew what type of game it was going to be. He needs to be better than that.’’ Eli Manning came down fairly hard on Richburg. “Both his penalties were ticky-tack,’’ Manning said Monday on WFAN. “The first one kinda for disagreeing with the ref on a call, he gets a personal foul. Hey, we don’t need that. Once you know you got one, you just got to be on your toes, you can’t afford to get another one. Makes a nice hit on Odell [Beckham’s] big run and just kind of does a little taunting and that’s not gonna fly. He’s got to be smarter than that.’’ Offensive lineman Will Beatty finally made his 2016 debut, but if you blinked, you missed it. He played one snap, on special teams, in his first game activated since re-signing. In need of help in the secondary, the Giants are expected to re-sign CB Michael Hunter, who was promoted from the practice squad last week and waived last Saturday.

Sometimes we even make predictions before this year’s device comes out, which is either incredibly annoying or a fun guessing game depending on how you look at it. One recent example that comes to mind regarding premature predictions is the Apple iPhone, which… is pretty much always being speculated about in one way or another. This year’s speculations regarding next year’s iPhone have been particularly intriguing because there’s a decent amount of hype going into the rumors that the 2017 iPhone is going to be what Apple has really been focusing on lately. Whether that’s true or just something people have glommed onto due to some disappointing changes in the iPhone 7 is something we’ll have to wait until next year to see officially, of course, but it doesn’t seem too farfetched to think that Apple would want to unveil something extra special on the 10-year anniversary of one of its most revolutionary products. While I don’t know exactly what changes are in store for the iPhone, I do think that there’s one (theoretically) simple change that Apple could make that would be refreshing for the iPhone: more colors. Apple has some history regarding a colorful lineup. Most people my age and older still recognize the rainbow-colored Apple logo pre-1998, with 1998 being the year that Apple changed over to the monochrome logo (which, aside from color, maintained its original design) we see today. However, in the same year that Apple axed the rainbow-colored logo, they introduced their iconic iMac G3 computers, which was revolutionary in three key ways: the entire computer was housed in the same case as the monitor, it was the first computer to use USB ports as the standard, and it eventually came in a variety of colorful translucent casings. You didn’t have to own one to know what they were – they were that quintessential. Another huge addition to Apple’s line-up was the iPod, and later the iPod Nano. While the original iPod hardly swayed from neutral colors aside from the occasional limited edition designs, the iPod Nano was offered in an array of bright colors, which ended up being a big selling point for the Nano line. The iPod eventually evolved to become the iPod Touch, which initially debuted in white and black colors. With the 5th generation of iPod touches, however, more colors had been added into the mix, which included silver, space gray, blue, pink, yellow, and (Product) RED. The 6th generation iPod touch also offered six colors, with but yellow had been traded in for gold. Even the iPhone, which was once only offered in white or black, eventually expanded to other neutral colors such as gold, rose gold, silver, and space gray. Apple also took the iPhone in a somewhat different direction with the short-lived iPhone 5c, which featured an array of bright pastel colors like blue, green, pink, yellow, and white. Since the iPhone 5c was first unveiled back in 2013, Apple hasn’t ventured outside of the neutral color scheme for any of its current iPhone lineup. I, for one, would love to see new colors come to the iPhone lineup next year. This year we saw the resurgence of the color black in the “Jet Black” iPhone 7, which has proven to be a popular option. However, I want to see some of the brighter, more unique colors come to the iPhone. While I wasn’t a big fan of the plastic build and soft pastel colors of the iPhone 5c, they do stand out to me in a crowd and add a touch of personalization. On the other hand, I am a fan of the design and colors of the more vibrantly colored iPod Touch line, and I think that some of those bold colors – particularly the blue and the red – would make a fresh and excellent addition to the iPhone lineup. It’s not the biggest change, or even an innovative one – I think Motorola knocked that aspect out of the park – but I think additional color choices are an option that people would enjoy having, and is something we could reasonably expect from Apple, a company that has already proven to be a fan of color variety. Readers, what are your thoughts? Do you hope that Apple adds additional color options to the iPhone lineup in the future? If so, what color do you think would look best on an iPhone?

"We don’t have an Internet connection at home. We don’t have a large flatscreen TV or a Blu-Ray," Kelly told 2machines. "We don’t even have a dishwasher. We don’t pay a mortgage and rent because why buy when everyone but my parents are gonna move out in a few years? So we spend money on our phones and Verizon bill instead." Kelly is a "smartphone-dependent" American, a group that has limited or no access to broadband internet other than their smartphones, according to a report by the Pew Research Center. In many cases, due to low-wage jobs, a smartphone is the one device they can afford. Smartphones are either the main or only way for millions of Americans, largely young and poor minorities, to get online. In fact, 24 million American adults can only access the internet through their smartphones, according to the same Pew report. Fifteen percent of Americans between the ages of 18 and 29 and 13 percent of Americans who make less than $30,000 per year are smartphone-dependent. 24 million American adults can only access the internet through their smartphones Twelve percent of African Americans and 13 percent of Latinos also rely on their smartphones for internet access, compared to only 4 percent of whites. If your smartphone is your primary or only method to access the internet, that means they aren’t a luxury, as some would have you believe. And if smartphones are no longer a luxury in 2016, then Apple designing the iPhone to require additional dongles to regain features it once had imposes a disproportionate cost on the most cost-sensitive users. Take the headphone jack. The belief that killing the most popular port in the world on the most popular smartphone in the world would have no consequences is wholly shortsighted. The removal of the headphone jack on the iPhone 7 may not matter to most people, and it may just be an inconvenience to some, but it will be a much bigger shift for a part of the population without the voice to grab Apple’s attention. In interviews with over 40 people, the Pacific Standard’s Julia Ticona found that smartphones have become essential tools for low-wage workers: I found these workers relied on their smartphones — and sometimes free Wi-Fi at restaurants and libraries — as essential tools in their digital hustle. They used their phones to find and coordinate work and care, and to alleviate stress in emotionally draining jobs. For many, making ends meet means constantly checking and participating in online networks and message boards to find work, as well as phone calls and text messages to coordinate their gigs. So why do some people still see smartphones as a luxury for the poor? This isn’t the early adopter, or the average tech buyer who may have the financial flexibility to buy a two or three new devices per year. This is the student buying a smartphone using public assistance that will help her study and work, or the single parent whose iPhone is the sole internet-connected device in the home. So removing the headphone jack from the iPhone 7 matters to these people far more than you may have thought. Apple’s Phil Schiller talked about how the company was being courageous and it would "do something new that betters all of us." But Apple didn’t consider the people who can’t afford that $40 dongle to restore the ability to charge your iPhone and use wired headphones at the same. Apple claims that very few people charge and listen to music at the same time, but I’d be willing to bet the people who do so are also likely to be the ones with no other computer in their homes. Apple didn’t consider the people who can’t afford that $40 dongle But how many people really aren’t able to afford an adapter? According to the Pew report, 48 percent of those smartphone-dependent Americans referenced earlier have canceled or shut off their service for a period of time because it was too expensive, while 30 percent of smartphone-dependent Americans frequently hit the data caps on their mobile plans. Kelly was one of those people. "We got cut off after a few months of not being able to pay our entire bill, and boy, the reactivation fees killed us too," Kelly told 2machines. "But that’s life when your cushion is thin." @yuusharo @reckless @gruber Apple is gambling those people that don't will be a rounding error. Current indicators show they are right. — Ed Lawford (@EpaL) September 22, 2016 Just get some BT headphones. Seriously. Went wireless 5 years ago, will never go back. https://t.co/A33uj4Chg0 — Samuel Gibbs (@SamuelGibbs) September 9, 2016 @bradpdx @gruber @verge Inconvenience is a real cost. Incompatibility is a real cost. Ecosystem lock-in is a real cost. — nilay patel (@reckless) September 22, 2016 There is a major awareness gap between people who have disposable incomes and can drop cash on a set of new accessories whenever an issue arises, and people who use smartphones as their means to stay connected to the outside world. And when those issues are engineered by the world’s richest company for arguably arbitrary reasons, it becomes problematic. Not being able to charge and listen means quiet drives to work or taking the kids to school. If you need your phone to last all day on a single charge, you will try and keep the battery close to 100 percent until you get to work. (This means not using the Lightning headphones to make calls in states that require hands-free calls while driving either.) The removal of the headphone jack will cause issues for a number of low-income consumers who will purchase the iPhone 7 or another phone without a headphone jack over the next few years. And those issues will persist until Apple delivers a legitimate charging solution that doesn’t cost more than a monthly payment for an iPhone. The removal of the headphone jack will cause issues for low-income consumers Sure, some consumers will hold onto their existing iPhones, or upgrade to the iPhone 6 or 6S, but in two years those phones won’t be on sale. And if you want to stay in the iOS ecosystem with an up-to-date phone, there will be no device with a headphone jack, forcing you to spend money to retain features that have become staples in your day-to-day life. When you don’t have money, you get enjoyment from the little things in life, like listening to podcasts on your commute or playing your kids’ favorite music in the car when you take them to school in the morning. But soon those events will be filled with worries about phones dying before the end of work or missing an important call from the daycare or babysitter, and they will come to an end. And for those who think people who can’t afford a dongle should switch to Android, that carries a second set of enormous costs: repurchasing years worth of apps, an entirely new set of chargers and accessories, being left out of the more vibrant iOS ecosystem, and more. Not to mention a distancing from family members and friends who use iMessage — the green bubbles of Android carry a socio-economic stereotype. Switching only serves to solve one problem while stoking the fires of another. During an interview with Fast Company last month, Apple executive Eddy Cue spoke on Apple Maps and noted that the service’s launch issues a few years ago is the reason Apple opened up iOS betas to the public. "For example, the reason you as a customer are going to be able to test iOS is because of Maps," Cue said. "We were never able to take it out to a large number of users to get that feedback. So, to all of us living in Cupertino, Maps seemed pretty darn good. Right? The problems weren’t obvious to us. Now we do a lot more betas." Once again, the problem wasn’t obvious. iPhone 7 and 7 Plus review More From The Verge The Verge: 2016 Yearbook The best games for your new PC or Mac The 15 best movies of 2016 Behind the scenes at Faraday Future, an electric carmaker on the brink of collapse The Verge 2016 tech report card: Facebook The best apps you didn’t know you needed for your new Android phone Now Trending CES 2017: What to expect at the biggest tech trade show of the year Olympus E-M1 Mark II review: the camera that warps time Dell has turned one of the best Windows laptops into a 2-in-1 hybrid The Kissenger simulates kissing your long-distance lover Donald Trump says 'no computer is safe' This Article has a component height of 39.

According to Bloomberg sources, the goal of Apple’s medical technology team is to ‘turn HealthKit into a tool that improves diagnoses.’ The report says Apple is already planning to introduce sleep tracking technology, thus far missing from the first two Apple Watch generations. Related: Apple Watch Series 2: 7 things you need to know The current lack of a sleep tracking app probably has more to do with the need to charge the battery every night than anything else. Also, Apple plans to put the heart rate data currently generated by the device to better use, according to the Bloomberg report. It would measure how long the heart takes to return to a resting level from the peak of strenuous exercise, the sources say. This metric is already seen by many in the fitness industry as a key metric in determining overall heart health. The difference is the data will be interpreted as well as just collated in ways that could benefit healthcare professionals and eventually do their job for them, the report says. It’s not clear yet whether the improvements on deck would require additional hardware or whether they could be included within a forthcoming watchOS update. The most recent watchOS update included a new breathing app, while greatly improving the Activity app and boosting the Workout app to show five metrics. Apple also optimized the Activity app for wheelchair users and added the ability to share progress towards Activity goals. Have you considered the Apple Watch Series 2?

From releasing a surprise mixtape on iTunes last year, to an exclusive stream of Views, all the way down to his own Beats 1 radio show. It looks like Drake shows no signs of stopping. After teasing it on his Instagram (and then removing it) it looks like Drake’s short film, Please Forgive Me, is now available to stream exclusively on Apple Music. Potentially riding off that high, the artist also shared a picture on Instagram commemorating Apple Music’s largest stream count for an album ever. Drake’s Views album may have only had a one-week exclusive on Apple’s service, but it appeared to have been all worth it once it was evident it sold over a million copies in less than fives days. According to the WSJ, Apple Music users had “streamed the album more than 250 million times world wide”. Today it looks like Drake hit a major milestone by being the first album to achieve over 1 billion streams on Apple Music. Sharing on Instagram a picture of the plaque he received, and signed by Tim Cook, Drake captioned the image simply as “B’s”.

Photo: REUTERS mail print View all comments Tweet By Markus Christen - - Published: 4:00 AM, September 27, 2016 It has happened again. Tech bloggers are mourning the loss of yet another technology that Apple has mercilessly thrown out of one of its devices. This time it is the 3.5mm audio jack, a 138-year-old technology that allows users to connect any type of wired headphones to their iPhone to listen to their music. The alternative will be the AirPods, wireless headphones that will connect seamlessly with the device. However, conspiracy theories abound that a world without wires is actually an attempt by Apple to tether us further to its technology and products. Apple says its decision is characterised by “courage”. It rightfully points out that customers want more battery power, better screens, better speakers, sharper cameras and faster processors — all of which are competing for space inside the same enclosure. Still, the techies are not hearing it. However, I would posit that it is not the techies that Apple is trying to please here. It is regular people — “the rest of us”, like Apple promised in its famous 1984 Macintosh ads. Most iPhone users like the iPhone because it just works. It is simple, but its functionality is high and valuable. Many users are tired of pulling their tangled and mangled headphones out of their pocket and handbags, then struggling to put them right for five minutes — not to mention the very real strife of jogging with wires all over the place. It is high time we lost the wire, but the removal of the audio jack is about more than the elimination of a humble analogue technology. It is also a lesson in making innovations succeed by changing the market, instead of trying to respond to it. FIRST MOVER Apple has been at the forefront of removing old technologies before. It was the first computer-maker to take out the compact disc (CD) drive from its Macbook computers, making the Macbook Air the thinnest laptop on the market. Later it killed the 30-pin connector USB cable in favour of Lightning. At each stage it has arguably helped customers make the transition to its new technologies, albeit at a cost. For those still in need of the use of CDs, customers could buy an external disk drive to plug into their laptops. Customers not able or willing to upgrade to a device with a Lightning port could also buy an adaptor for their 30-pin connector. As the underdog computer-maker in its early years, it was easier to take the risk of radical changes. It is refreshing to see that Apple, as a leader today, has not lost its appetite for taking risks. There are always gripes about the extra money customers have to fork out for the kit needed to bridge the new technology, but eventually the customer comes around to Apple’s way of thinking, mainly because it adds value along the way. This dynamic is reflected in the principles of Insead’s Blue Ocean Strategy, which states that key to value innovation is the ability of companies to make products easier to use so that consumers embrace the innovative changes. As we have seen before, Apple is good at changing consumer behaviour because it knows how to make life easier for them. AirPods last longer and are easier to charge than other wireless headphones. But the bigger innovation is the simplification of the pairing with the phone. They connect automatically to the phone when they are out of the pouch, and the phone recognises when you wear them in your ears to send the sound to the right output. To be sure, there will always be some consumers resistant to change. For one, unlike headphones, the AirPods do not come free with the iPhones. They will get an adaptor to help them make the transition instead. This might make the transition a longer one, but it seems likely to happen in the end. Apple’s transition to wireless music started with its acquisition of Beats and its range of Bluetooth headsets, which make listening to music while travelling and running a breeze. The AirPods are a way to mainstream this technology and behaviour, increasing the usability of Apple devices, especially when exercising. The company’s interest in health and wellness is well known. The Apple Watch carries a heart rate monitor as well as step and sleep tracking. It is highly likely that the AirPods plus the Watch will become the only companion a jogger needs, leaving the phone for other functions, especially since the Watch can hold a music library of its own and carry out GPS tracking in the new Apple/Nike Watch version. True, the AirPods are missing noise-cancellation technology like more-advanced headphones on the market, such as Beats. But as I mentioned earlier, Apple is aiming to change the general consumer, not the music connoisseur. Furthermore, this could be intentional. Apple often leaves out features in initial launches (for example, the first iPad had no camera even though the space was ready). This reduces complexity, and with that, unwanted surprises such as bugs, errors or defects. It also means the updated version is already designed. It is therefore not a question of what to launch, but when to launch it. That is partly how Apple keeps its momentum going. One could argue that Apple is trying to offset declining sales of its iPhone, and the AirPods will prop up sales of its “other” category, which includes the Watch and iPod. Either way, the company is leading the way yet again — not with breakthrough technology, but with a solution that is user friendly and intuitive. It is thus safe to assume that Apple’s customers are likely to get on board with it, especially those increasingly interested in health and wellness.

No, even Apple can't beat physics Javed Anwer   |   @brijwaasi Last Updated: SEP 26, 2016 New Delhi Email Author There is a lot of talk about the iPhone 7 camera, particularly the camera in the iPhone 7 Plus. It has got new hardware. The image sensor inside the iPhone 7 is bigger. The lens has the optical stabilisation built in. The iPhone 7 Plus camera comes with an extra lens system, a lens that has 2X optical zoom, despite its thin profile and a 56mm focal length, which along with the zoom puts it into among the medium-range telephoto lenses. Then there is new image processor, which according to Apple can create some solid magic, to say it in the proverbial sense. All of this is impressive, so very impressive that Apple has hinted that the iPhone 7 Plus can beat the regular cameras or even match DSLR cameras. Also Read: iPhone 7 manufacturing cost is more than iPhone 6S: IHS Markit Although the company stopped short of explicitly saying that the iPhone 7 or the iPhone Plus can beat a DSLR camera, its marketing for the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus cameras has focussed on stressing the fact these phones are almost as good as any proper camera at clicking images. In the run up to the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus availability in the market, Apple has highlighted their camera capabilities by sharing images clicked with these two devices by professional photographers. And in the image samples the company has focussed on showing the images that are difficult to click with the phones, such as images of sports, or moving subjects, or the images that have lots of dynamic light. Yet, these are the exact scenes that Apple has showed in image samples of the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus. Obviously, the company believes that the camera in the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus is better than anything else put in a phone until now. And, from whatever we have seen so far, they cameras inside these phones indeed look to be very impressive. But they are not, as many have hinted, better than proper cameras. And they don't match the DSLR cameras. The reasons are several but the biggest is despite ingenuity from Apple, the company just can't beat the physics of photography. And although it can cheat, in a good way, and can bend some of the rules of light and photography, for now the technology is just not there to make a phone as good as a DSLR camera. Not just the image quality To understand why the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus -- or for that matter any phone or small camera -- can't beat the DSLR camera, you need to understand why people use DSLR cameras. The DSLR cameras are popular not because they can produce images with great quality. Yes, it is true that compared to other kind of cameras, the DSLR cameras capture images that have more details, better colours and the overall more contrast and sharpness. But then so many small cameras -- the RX 100 IV, for example -- can match or even surpass a DSLR camera on these parameters. Photo clicked by iPhone 7But three areas where a DSLR camera is unbeatable are the speed, particularly the focus speed, the ergonomics and the lens flexibility. This is the reason why DSLR cameras are so popular. When you shooting sports, like real sport and not the images of people singing national anthem before the match, you need a camera that is going to track a player across the frame, whether is jumping to get hold of the basketball or ducking to avoid a tackle. This is something only DSLRs can do. Not even expensive mirrorless cameras have the ability to track a subject, such as a cheetah running zig-zag at a speed of 100km per hour while chasing an antelope, with pin point accuracy. Only a good DSLR camera can do that. The cameras in phone, on the other hand, finds it difficult to even track a pet cat. The second bit is the balance. Over the years, DSLR cameras have acquired this particular grip that ensures a photographer holds the camera steady. This not only allows for fast shooting but also steady shooting, which is important to get sharp images. Half of the images clicked with phones aren't sharp because it is tough to hold these devices steady while shooting images. Finally, there is the flexibility of lens. The problem with photography is that it for the best results different scenes require different technology. So, to click landscape photos you need a wide-angle lens. To click birds, which are tiny, you need a lens that can super-zoom into something like 500mm focal length. The laws of physics dictate that creating an all-purpose lens is almost impossible. And even if you do create one, it is going to be big because it has to account for all sorts of scenes and all sorts of lighting conditions. Only DSLR cameras have this flexibility of allowing people to have different kind of lenses in their arsenal. The rules of physics The problem for the iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, or any other phone hoping to beat DSLR cameras, is the physics. Irrespective of innovation or out-of-the-box thinking, there is no beating laws of physics. The photography, which is actually a play of the light and mirrors, is all about physics. The phase-detect auto focus, for example, that makes the DSLR cameras so good at acquiring focus and tracking fast-moving subjects, is all about bouncing the lights from several components in the camera until it reaches the phase detect sensor, which is separate from the image sensor. The whole is quite complex and is tuned for the auto focus speed. It is also large and with current technology cannot be miniaturised into something small. Although, nowadays phone makers as well as camera makers have started putting phase detect points on to the main image sensor, it doesn't help much because it's not as effective as the standalone system in a DSLR camera. Photo clicked by iPhone 7Similarly, the phones makers run into the laws of physics when they deal with the image sensors and lenses. It is just simple fact that a bigger image sensor has ability to capture more light and data. The image sensor inside DSLR is huge. There is just no way that a phone can capture same amount of data with its small sensor, although it has to be said that the phones do have ability to process this data in a better way because of their expertise in software and the machine learning. Also Read: Full list: India prices of iPhone 7 and all other new Apple devices Finally, there is the lens part. The optics inside any lens, their aperture, the way lens elements shift... all of this affects the quality of photos including the depth of field -- yes, the same blurred background that looks so good in portrait photos. There is a reason why most of the lenses that professionals use are big and bulky. This is because the best lenses have lots and lots of glass and a complex design, which is aimed at ensuring best image quality and fastest focus that is possible. The size, as some would say, matters when it comes to good quality lenses. The bright future But with all said and done, it is also true that the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus seem fairly remarkable. Just like the Huawei Nexus 6P, on the Android side. As noted earlier, Apple, or for that matter any other company, cannot beat the rules of physics. But it can cheat. In various ways. The one part of the iPhone 7 that should scare the camera makers is the new image processor. There is no substitute for pure optics. Or the basic technology. But software can replace a lot of moving parts in any gadget. For example, a phone with a bigger battery will theoretically last longer. But what if you optimise the battery with software. In this case, you can make even a smaller battery last longer, the way many phone companies do. The same is true for a lot of camera parts. Although right now the technology that would replace most of functionality in a DSLR camera with software doesn't exist, in future it should. Photo clicked by iPhone 7For example, in the future the image processing engine may become so powerful that will make calculations necessary for accurate and fast focus tracking even without requiring a complex and big phase-detect auto-focus system. Similarly, it will process the bokeh or the blurred background using simulation and prediction instead of what the lens sees and hence may eliminate the need for a big lens. Although the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus hint at some of these features from the future, these capabilities aren't there yet in the phones because the technology for them is not yet available. Also Read: iPhone 7 users drill hole in phone to get 3.5mm jack back, fail hard So, to summarise: Yes, the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus have very good cameras inside them. But don't compare them to a DSLR camera, or even a good point-and-shoot camera. When you go on a safari to Africa, don't rely on your iPhone 7 to click great photos, irrespective of whatever Apple says.

By Matthew Miller for Smartphones and Cell Phones | September 26, 2016 -- 19:30 GMT (12:30 PDT) | Topic: Mobility Deeply scratched iPhone 7 camera lens cover. (Image: JerryRigEverything) Last year, when I broke down the costs for iPhone screen replacement, it made little sense to purchase AppleCare+. This year, Apple dropped the screen replacement fee from $99 to $29, so AppleCare+ protection coverage makes a lot more monetary sense. The new Apple iPhone 7 and 7 Plus also have an IP67 water- and dust-resistance rating, which is great for spills and accidents. However, be aware that the standard Apple one-year warranty does not cover water damage. The AppleCare+ plan does include this coverage, so if you plan to use your iPhone -- against all recommendations -- under the water, then you should definitely purchase the AppleCare+ coverage. As Apple did with the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, purchasing an iPhone 7 or 7 Plus through the Apple iPhone Upgrade Program includes the entry fee for AppleCare+. Apple posted a breakdown in fees for your iPhone, as shown in the image below. Image: Apple Now, let's take a closer look at your new iPhone 7 or 7 Plus with multiple incidents. As you can see, if you break more than the display, including water damage, then it makes perfect sense to purchase AppleCare+. There is a difference in the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus fees without AppleCare+ coverage. Values in parentheses are cumulative costs. Without AppleCare+ (screen only) With AppleCare+ protection (screen only) Without AppleCare+ With AppleCare+ protection Entry fee $0 $129 $0 $129 Replace 1st broken device $149/$129 ($149/$129) $29 ($158) $349/$319 ($478/$448) $99 ($228) Replace 2nd broken device $149/$129 ($298/$258) $29 ($187) $349/$319 ($827/$767) $99 ($327) Replace 3rd broken device $349/$319 ($647/$577) $349/$319 ($536/$506) $349/$319 ($1176/$1086) $349/$319 ($676/$646) It's pretty clear that water damage and other damage -- other than screen damage -- without AppleCare+ means you will likely pay more than the device value with two incidents. The table also shows that it's still less expensive than a new iPhone to purchase AppleCare+ if you break your iPhone three times. AppleCare+ covers two incidents in the two-year coverage period. If you break your display once and then damage your replacement, you will revert to the out-of-coverage fees for any further incidents. AppleCare+ does not protect you for theft or loss. Given the expensive initial cost of the iPhone and the parity reached with one screen replacement, I am likely going to purchase AppleCare+ for my phones. The water resistance means I plan to use my iPhone 7 Plus while running and in inclement environmental conditions, so the peace of mind gained from possible damage due to water may be worth the cost of AppleCare+.

Updating a car can involve a new set of wheels or all-weather floormats, but what’s crazy about some newer cars is that people without any special automotive knowledge can add a useful feature to their car by following simple directions from the automaker. That’s what happened to our 2017 Kia Sportage EX AWD long-termer, which now has Apple CarPlay thanks to a few easy steps and one quiet drive home. The Sportage’s infotainment system is already pretty good, but Apple CarPlay (and the also-available Android Auto) have some advantages. So as soon as I found out that Kia and Hyundai were offering an update to the car’s software that owners could perform themselves, I got started. Because our Sportage is equipped with a navigation system, I followed these directions with the car’s SD card, but if my 2017 Sportage lacked that feature, I would have used a USB drive and these directions. Curious if your Kia is eligible for the upgrade? In a July 19 release, the automaker noted that some trims of these cars might be eligible for a free update: 2017 Kia Forte 2015-2016 Kia Optima (and hybrid) 2015-2016 Kia Sedona 2014-2016 Kia Soul (and the 2015-2016 Soul EV) 2016 Kia Sorento 2017 Kia Sportage With the SD card, all I had to do was follow the directions and continue with my work day until the update was installed. The only real sacrifice came with my drive home that day, which involved awkwardly listening to music from the single speaker of my iPhone while the car’s infotainment system updated itself, taking about 40 minutes. Why Care About Apple CarPlay or Android Auto? Apple CarPlay’s biggest advantage (and that of Android Auto) is on cars without an integrated navigation system, such as our long-term 2016 Volkswagen Golf SportWagen. Suddenly, with Apple CarPlay, you’ve got navigation, and as a bonus, it’s linked to your phone. In the Kia’s case, I sacrifice the navigation’s helpful speed-limit display for CarPlay’s ability to track what’s already on my phone. If, for example, I left open an address on the Maps app of my iPhone, once I plug in the phone to the car, the system makes it easy for me to pull up that address and get directions. Apple CarPlay also makes text messaging much safer and easier. When a message comes in, the system can read the message aloud and, with voice command, compose a response message while you’re driving. Now that iOS 10 has arrived for newer iPhones, the Maps app finally allows an option to avoid toll roads whether you’re using the 2-D or 3-D map view. Also with iOS 10, I can move compatible apps I use most frequently to the first display page of icons on the Sportage’s 8.0-inch screen. Although I still like Kia’s own navigation system and especially the speed limit display, I’m thankful the automaker offered this update. Whether you are forced to update your own car after a notification from the automaker or get a car with Apple CarPlay or Android Auto already installed, I’ve found it to be a meaningful upgrade, and because I did it myself, it was free.

The iPhone maker is cheap and the risk is lower, according to Robert Naess, who oversees $37 billion in stocks at Nordea Bank, Scandinavia’s largest bank. “Apple is boring now,” he said in an interview at Nordea’s offices in Oslo Thursday. “Before there was no stability and growth was too high.” Investors have started questioning Apple’s ability to expand after the company ended 13 straight years of uninterrupted sales growth earlier in 2016. Shares are up 6.8 percent so far this year. For Naess, 52, it’s a buying opportunity. He started buying stock in May and now holds about 2 percent in Apple in his funds. “It’s the first time,” he said. “We’ve had the fund since 2005 and never owned Apple.” Naess and his partner Claus Vorm quantitatively analyze thousands of companies to build a portfolio of about 100 “boring” stocks. They are investing in companies with the most stable earnings and avoiding expensive stocks. Global Stable Equity Fund has returned 19 percent on average in the past five years, beating 98 percent of its peers. “Many think it’s a peak, Apple is done and won’t succeed anymore but we look at the long-term earnings trend,” Naess said. “Our case it that they keep their market share and that things will be OK going forward.” Overall, earnings growth estimates for 2017 are too high, according to Naess. A year from now, global earnings growth will be as low as zero percent, which will cool the market, he said. While Naess operates strictly by the spreadsheet when it comes to investing, on a personal level his passion is cars, especially Teslas. He and his family have bought so many of the top-end electric cars that Elon Musk’s carmaker at one time banned him from ordering more. With sales now down, he said he’s once again allowed to place orders and is about to receive a Tesla Model X in the fall. But one thing he won’t buy is the company’s stock. “Don’t buy Tesla because they lose money all the time,” he said. “Economically, Tesla is a terribly bad company.” There’s a high risk Tesla won’t make any money because it’s difficult to go from producing 50,000 cars to more than 500,000 cars, he said. “I think they won’t make it,” said Naess. “I use Tesla as an example of a stock you shouldn’t invest in, even if they make fun and fine cars that I buy.” While his funds have outperformed in the low rate environment in the years after the financial crisis, Naess sees rising rates as a long-term threat to his funds’ returns. “It’s difficult to hide from that risk,” he said. “But the risk for that is low. It could happen but it could take 30 years before it happens.” Tags:  Apple More Business News stock market Click for Digital & Home Delivery - 50% blog comments powered by Disqus More in Business As populists won 2016 ballots, world’s richest made $237 billion January 02, 2017, 6:24 pm In a year when populist voters reshaped power and politics across Europe and the U.S., the world’s wealthiest people are ending 2016 with $237 billion more than they had at the start.

Follow TechnoBuffalo The iPhone 7 is all anyone can talk about right now but Apple may still have more goodies to release before the year is up. Analyst Rhoda Alexander, Director of Tablet and Notebook PCs at IHS Markit Technology, believes the Cupertino company will release refreshes of its MacBook Air and MacBook Pro laptops this fall—likely in October. If you’ve been following the rumors surrounding Apple’s revamped MacBook Pro, the idea of a new laptop launching soon isn’t exactly new. A Bloomberg report in August claimed the company is gearing up to launch a revamped MacBook Pro with an OLED display above the keyboard, something apparently known internally at Apple as a “Dynamic Function Row.” The same Bloomberg report said the refreshed MacBook Air would include a USB-C port, while an updated iMac would feature a new graphics chip. Rhoda says production for Apple’s devices began in the second quarter of this year, which could mean Intel’s new Kaby Lake processor won’t be included in the new models. Kaby Lake was announced about a month ago, although the chips began shipping to manufacturers and OEMs during the second quarter of 2016, so it’s still possible. October is just around the corner, so invites to an Apple event should go out any day now.

Both historical and contemporary perceptions of tax have characterised it as a necessary extraction, a penalty. A likely fallout of this statutory burden is that there is an innate urge to either mitigate the liability or even eliminate it. Tax avoidance is when a lawful mitigation of tax burden takes place. Tax evasion is where a seepage in the boundaries set by fiscal laws is discovered, and which is then used to escape the tax net to a great extent or altogether. Here is the genesis of tax notoriety, the artistry, where prima facie the tax mitigation exercise appears legitimate, but in reality it maybe an abusive tax avoidance strategy which may lead to very low payment or no payment of taxes. Era of double non-taxation Out of all the taxes, corporate taxes imposed on multinational corporations (MNCs) are major sources of revenue for most economies. But in the event of these corporate tax payers shifting their tax liabilities from a high tax jurisdiction to a low- or no-tax jurisdiction, massive revenue losses are imminent for the fiscal jurisdiction where the taxes should have been ideally paid. Once riddled with incidents of double taxation, the MNCs have now outsmarted the system and have moved into an era of double non-taxation. With a mélange of some creative accounting techniques and existing loopholes in different fiscal jurisdictions across the world, tax evasion has emerged as a global woe in the last few decades. Various countermeasures have been deployed by states, either at an individual level or as members of different economic groups. Lately, the north and south have come together and there is a conscious attempt to tackle the reckless acts of base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS). The BEPS action plan is a step in that direction where the developing and the developed have jointly worked on strategies to curb the exploitation of gaps and mismatches in tax rules, which can be used to artificially shift profits to low- or no-tax locations. Since a majority of corporate entities in such jurisdictions have little or no economic activity and are mere subterfuges, it is all the more critical to identify and penalise such entities. Some jurisdictions have also taken the initiative of revising or updating their existing Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements (DTAAs) to plug the existing loopholes. Another important instrument of tackling tax notoriety are the Tax Information Exchange Agreements. These bilateral agreements act as information bridges between different fiscal jurisdictions and they aid in the establishment of tax transparency. Despite some major limitations, various fiscal jurisdictions have already gone ahead with signing such agreements. Further, novel techniques such as the Diverted Profits Tax, popularly known as the Google Tax, are providing more salvo to the tax administrators in tackling aggressive tax planning. Apple tax ruling Now, a colossal decision by the European Commission on August 30 has taken the fight against “aggressive tax planning” by corporations to a new turf altogether. The European Commission has issued a ruling in relation to the tax arrangements of Apple in Ireland, where it has its European headquarters. A bulk of its global sales profits are directed there. In a nutshell, the subject matter of this dispute was the selective treatment, a sweet deal, granted by Ireland to Apple Ireland through two tax rulings in 1991 and 2007. The Commission relied on the financial information of Apple Ireland and found that though the corporation recorded a €16 billion profit in 2011, the effective tax rate on the same amount was just 0.05 per cent in the same period. It also found that the rate in effect declined to 0.005 per cent in 2014 even as profits grew. These corporate tax rates are significantly lower than the corporate tax rates applicable in any other EU member state. Therefore, the Commission has questioned this entire special tax arrangement extended by Ireland to Apple on grounds of illegal state aid and failure to reflect economic reality. The Commission has consequently ordered Ireland to recover up to €13 billion from Apple Ireland. On the one hand, this retrospective action against Apple focusses on compensating Ireland for a loss of revenue in at least the last decade. Then again, it is also a clear message to all EU member states not to slacken their taxes excessively and maintain diligence when entering into special arrangements with MNCs. The wrath of the Commission is not sudden, and its vigil stretches to hundreds of matters similar to Apple. One among several such investigations is the scrutiny of Luxembourg’s special tax arrangements for Amazon and McDonald’s. Challenging the Commission Interestingly, though the Commission’s decisions would appear to undo the wrong done to the EU member states by the tax-avoiding MNCs, the decisions are not seeing a meek acceptance at the hands of the concerned states and the defaulting corporations. In fact, the Netherlands and Luxembourg are the first countries to challenge the Commission over its decisions last year that the tax arrangements they extended to Starbucks and Fiat Chrysler, respectively, were illegal. Even Apple and Ireland have decided to appeal against the Commission’s decision. This is an alarming emergence where the concerned fiscal jurisdictions, despite being awarded judicious reliefs, are simply trying to justify the special arrangements which allowed such tax seepages in the first place. This trend also seems to add an entirely new chapter to tax notoriety, where the states are coming to the aid of the defaulting MNCs and both are in harmony against any possible regulatory measures by the concerned authorities. Clearly, the tax defaulters and tax administrators are in no mood of granting respite to each other. The sensational duel between prolific tax notoriety and amplified tax vigilance continues.

We've known that ever since a team of doctors took center stage to introduce Apple Watch software, but a new report sheds a little more detail on what Apple's plans look like. According to a report in Bloomberg (although not from famous Apple sage Mark Gurman), Apple is working on at least two standalone apps for the Apple Watch, with the aim being to turn the Watch and associated HealthKit platform "into a tool that improves diagnoses." It's a long way from facilitating Candy Crush, that's for sure. DON'T MISS: Please don’t drill a headphone jack into your iPhone 7 The report cites "people familiar with the [HealthKit] team’s plans," and explains the details of two apps that are in the works. One is to track sleep patterns, which would be cool, if you didn't have to take the watch off every night to recharge. The other is meant to gauge users' overall fitness levels by calculating how long your heart rate takes to go from peak to resting level. If you combine that data with information about users' sex, height, and weight, you get a very accurate picture of their recovery rate. That, in turn, is a good surrogate for overall health and fitness. Measuring recovery is something that professional athletes and trainers have been doing for a while now, but putting those kinds of smarts into a device that every person is meant to wear on their wrist every day is something else. The broader scope of Apple's plans, at least according to Bloomberg, is to insert its software and hardware into the hospital system. That's likely to be a longer-term ambition, but as everyone stops buying 'boring' iPhones, Apple is hoping that the reveneue from the healthcare can keep sustaining its giant piles of cash.   Trending right now: 9 paid iPhone apps on sale for free for a limited time Galaxy S7 edge explodes in the Philippines iPhone 7 sales may be lower than the iPhone 6s, analyst claims See the original version of this article on BGR.com Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share What to Read Next 9 tech-friendly gifts for people obsessed with travel Yahoo Tech CNN uses screenshot from ‘Fallout 4’ to show how Russians hack things BGR News Facebook launches live 360-degree video feature Yahoo Tech LG is ready to make the future more colorful with its Super UHD TVs at CES 2017 Digital Trends The battle between SSD and HDD is over, and the winner is clear Digital Trends Celebrity sues Tesla, claims Model X drove itself through a wall and into his house BGR News Privacy |Terms |About our Ads |Suggestions Brought to you by Yahoo Finance

In the future, if the company gets its way, the software will interpret that information, turning it into advice for users, doctors and others. Scores of health-care experts hired by Apple in recent years are building improved electronic health record software that can better analyze and understand the implications of patient data, according to people familiar with the team’s plans. The iPhone maker is also working on new apps for the Apple Watch. One helps users track sleep patterns, one of the people said. Another app gauges fitness levels by measuring the time taken for the heart rate to fall from its peak to resting level, according to one of the other people. Apple already has an app that measures heart rate, but doesn’t interpret that data. The ultimate goal of Apple’s medical technology team is to turn HealthKit into a tool that improves diagnoses, the people said. The system could chip away at two problems that plague the industry and have stumped other specialist firms in the field: interoperability — allowing data to be transferred from hospital to hospital across different databases; and analysis — making it quick and easy for physicians to extrapolate salient information from mountains of data. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook wants Apple to do more in software and services to secure new sources of revenue and make customers more dependent on the company’s devices. The $8-trillion global health-care industry is a big opportunity. “If you drive for a while and your car gets too hot, it says pull over. If you need an oil change, it says check your oil. What’s the equivalent for the body?” Cook said at a May conference in Amsterdam. “Health is a huge issue around the world and we think it’s ripe for simplicity and a new view.” An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. Earlier this year, Apple bought Gliimpse Inc., a startup that built software to pull electronic health records from different databases and in different formats, then store them in one place. “I will be working on building a platform, a set of application program interfaces, and a simple product that will bring what we believe will be a disruptive consumer health-care application to the U.S. for the first time,” Apple Health senior engineer Mohan Randhava wrote on his LinkedIn profile, which states he was employed at Gliimpse until February. He likened the product to Apple’s music business. That started with the iPod, but as people became accustomed to storing all their music files digitally, Apple built a lucrative music platform on top of the device. Apple health software could become a revenue driver, too, by keeping people wedded to the company’s devices. If a patient’s health records, and related suggestions, are accessible through Apple’s system, it would be harder to trade in an iPhone for a smartphone running Google’s Android operating system, and its health-tracking software Google Fit. The second version of Apple’s Watch has a faster processor, a built-in GPS tracker and is water resistant so people can run, swim and do other exercise with the device. The updated Watch software, dubbed watchOS 3, places health tracking information more prominently in the user interface, and adds a breathing exercise app as well as swim tracking. Building more sensors into the Watch serves a limited purpose. An accelerometer can generate most of the useful data needed to monitor a person’s well-being, according to one person with knowledge of Apple’s plans. A glucometer or blood-pressure sensor would only help a small percentage of users, the person said. Adding new medical sensors would also likely require approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, a much higher bar for Apple to cross. “If they are going to an FDA device, it would need to have enough battery life to last a day, and something where it independently functions from your phone,” said Yuri Teshler, a health-care consultant at Moor Insights & Strategy. Apple can’t really do anything more with health-related sensors until the watch has a wireless LTE chip and the independent cellular connection that comes with that, he added. Apple has so far struggled to do that. It’s unclear how soon improvements to Apple’s HealthKit may be introduced. ResearchKit, another Apple software, lets research institutions and drugmakers conduct clinical trials using iPhone apps, and some of the trials hint at possible future applications for HealthKit. Each clinical study using ResearchKit brings Apple a step closer to embedding itself in hospitals, labs and doctors’ surgeries. North Carolina’s Duke University developed a ResearchKit app using the iPhone’s front-facing camera to conduct facial recognition checks which try to screen for and diagnose autism. Johns Hopkins University is using the Apple Watch’s accelerometer and heart-rate sensor to track the onset and duration of seizures and try to predict them. In July, GlaxoSmithKline Plc became the first drug maker to start a ResearchKit clinical study. “Apple is working hard with many of these large institutions to generate tools that are medically correct, to take data from sensors,” said Scott Jenkins, CEO of health data management company Certainty Health LLC. “They want to be the repository, the open collection space.” Stephen Friend, a Merck & Co. veteran who founded health data non-profit Sage Bionetworks, is credited with being the brains behind ResearchKit. He joined Apple full-time in June having worked as a consultant for more than two years. Flipboard co-founder Evan Doll rejoined Apple in July as a director of health software engineering. Yoky Matsuoka, formerly technology chief at Google’s Nest Labs unit, also joined Apple’s health team last year. Nest is known mostly as a hardware specialist, but Matsuoka led the development of software that interpreted and learned from data that its internet-connected thermostats collect. She’s using that machine-learning experience as she oversees a health-data team at Apple. Apple’s greatest hurdle for now is proving to medical professionals that data delivered from wearables through HealthKit and ResearchKit is reliable. Brennan Spiegel, a gastroenterologist at Los Angeles’ Cedars-Sinai Hospital, said clinical studies are crucial to making wearables useful. “It’s wonderful to have advanced methods of aggregating and presenting data, but there’s a risk of it becoming a garbage-in, garbage-out project,” Spiegel said. “It doesn’t matter how sophisticated the technical solution is. What matters is whether the data going into that solution are generating clinically valuable, actionable results that’s improving human health in a way that’s cost-effective.” Filed under: Apple Print Email Gmail Related Apple iOS 8 Software Bug Affects Health Apps FTC in Talks With Apple About Health-Data Protection Apple’s ResearchKit Could Be Boon for Medical Research, But There Are Concerns Apple Watch Moves Internet Out of Your Pocket Apple Holds Media Event, Unveils Apple Watch and New MacBook More in Technology RWD, FWD, AWD, 4WD and Snow Tires — What’s the Difference, and Which is Best?

But that hasn’t stopped some people from trying it. A new video published to YouTube depicts YouTube user “TechRax” placing the iPhone 7 into a vice and getting out his 3.5mm drill bit. He then takes the bit to the iPhone 7 and drills a hole into the device. Best of all, the headphones fit into the hole he drilled. Since being published last week, the video has gone viral with nearly 10 million views. While the TechRax video demonstrates that the headphone hole he drilled does not actually work, it hasn’t stopped several users from actually trying it out. In fact, the YouTube video is filled with comments from people who claim to have tried the technique—only to discover that drilling a hole into the smartphone leaves it unusable. “Help,” one person wrote on the YouTube page on Sunday. “Now my old headphones fit in but the phone doesn’t work anymore!” Several other comments evoke a similar tone, with one user complaining that the iPhone 7 is “dead” and wondering if it would require a long charge to come back on. Apple made the controversial decision to offer an iPhone 7 without the headphone jack, making it the first Apple smartphone not to offer a place for users to plug in their wired headphones. Instead, Apple shipped iPhone 7 units with an adapter that lets users plug in tethered headphones through the Lightning port. Apple is also releasing wireless earbuds next month, called AirPods, that will wirelessly connect to the iPhone 7. While iPhone 7 demand appears strong despite the omission, some owners have criticized Apple’s decision. Some of those people are apparently so concerned with the move that they would believe a joke video showing a person drilling a hole into the bottom of the iPhone 7. While TechRax’s video posting doesn’t suggest it’s a joke—the description says the video is “for those who don’t want to get $159 wireless AirPods or have to insert your headphones into an adapter every time you listen to music”—his profile and set of videos suggest he has a long history of jokingly fiddling with technology. His profile, for instance, says he’s been “smashing technology since 2011.” Now, though, the joke has been taken seriously by iPhone 7 owners who are left with a very expensive brick that won’t be covered under warranty. And it’s all because they think they need a 3.5mm hole in their iPhone 7 to listen to music. In truth, the iPhone 7’s adapter works just fine with wired headphones and drilling a hole in the smartphone won’t do any good; it’ll kill the iPhone 7 and void its warranty. So, whatever you do, don’t drill a hole in your iPhone 7. This article originally appeared on Fortune.com Read Next Your browser is out of date.

And if that's going to be true, the future needs to involve a lot more than just earbuds. So today it's been announced that Sonos speakers are coming to Apple's retail locations. You'll be able to buy either the Play:1 ($199) or Play:5 ($499) starting today on Apple.com in the United States. They'll be in physical stores beginning October 5th. Web sales will also be available in international markets over "the coming weeks." Anyone who buys a Sonos speaker through Apple will receive a free three-month gift card for Apple Music. That promotion is effective immediately and runs through December 31st. Sonos speakers are available from a lot of stores already (Best Buy, Target, etc.), and you're not going to find any price differences at Apple; that gift card or maybe a convenient location close to you are really the only incentives to buy Sonos from Apple. The company apparently won't be offering Sonos' Play:3, Playbar soundbar, and subwoofer. Unlike AirPods and wireless headphones, Sonos speakers do not function over Bluetooth. They instead use Wi-Fi (and the Sonos app on your phone or PC) to play audio from your own music collection and popular subscription services like Spotify, Pandora, Google Play Music, and yes, Apple Music. But they're wireless and sound great, which makes for a nice demo of Apple's "vision" of our audio future.

But when security is done right, it's a beautiful thing...sexy even. Security IS sexy. News Analysis iOS 10 backups are easier to crack, but Apple promises to fix security flaw Forensic researcher claims iOS 10 local backups are easier to crack since the security protection is 2,500 times weaker than in iOS 9, but Apple promised to roll out a patch for the security flaw.

Credit: William Iven More like this Hands on: ‘Siri, what’s new in macOS Sierra?’ Why (and how) you should manage Windows PCs like iPhones Your essential iOS 10 upgrade guide Video IT security: 3 things you need to know now After Apple’s battle over encryption with the FBI, you’d expect Apple’s newest iOS to continue the trend of providing even better privacy and security than the previous iOS version. Sadly, that’s currently not true as iOS 10 has a “major security flaw” which leaves the data locally backed up to iTunes much more vulnerable to password cracking. At least that is what Russian forensic software company Elcomsoft claimed on Friday. Apple allegedly weakened the method for protecting local backup files in iOS 10 by skipping some security checks. In other words, the security mechanism for protecting iOS 10 backups, which are saved locally on a computer via iTunes, are more susceptible to password-cracking tools. “The new security check is approximately 2,500 times weaker compared to the old one that was used in iOS 9 backups,” Elcomsoft researcher Oleg Afonin announced. Elcomsoft, which makes forensic software to gain access to password-protected, locked and encrypted information on mobile devices, was tweaking its Phone Breaker software so it would work on iOS 10. That’s when the company discovered the “alternative password verification mechanism” which Apple added to iOS 10 backups. Even if you look at it with a jaded eye, thinking it’s a handy approach for selling forensic software, Elcomsoft said it can crunch 6,000,000 passwords per second, making it 40 times faster than the “old method” that had GPU acceleration – something the new method does not have. It is because Apple makes secure smartphones that forensic investigators focus on data backups. “Forcing an iPhone or iPad to produce an offline backup and analyzing resulting data is one of the very few acquisition options available for devices running iOS 10,” Elcomsoft said. If an attacker or law enforcement can crack the password, then they can nab decrypted data – everything in the backup, including the keychain. “Keychain is Apple’s protected storage that is additionally encrypted on a file level (on top of the already active full-disk encryption that works on a block level),” explained Afonin. “While stored on the device, the keychain is encrypted with a key that is buried deep in Secure Enclave. Even if you can jailbreak a 64-bit iOS device (iPhone 5s and newer), you would still be unable to extract decryption keys for the keychain.” Password security expert Per Thorsheim wants to know if Apple purposefully used a weaker hashing algorithm, since the company “changed from PBKDF2” algorithm, (SHA1), “with 10,000 iterations into using a plain SHA256 hash with a single iteration only.” He doesn’t believe the change happened by “pure error,” since Apple had many iOS 10 beta versions. Thorsheim wrote, “The interesting question for Apple to answer is whether this massive weakening of your security and privacy is intentional, if it is a stupid glitch, or is it clueless crypto/developers?” Surely after going toe-to-toe with the feds over encryption and people’s right to privacy, the issue is a result of a big-time security blunder and not intentionally stabbing users in the back to please law enforcement? It is important to note that this not a remote hack and does not apply to iCloud backups. An attacker, or law enforcement, would need access to a victim’s computer where the local backup is stored. Apple acknowledged the issue and promised the flaw will be fixed via an upcoming patch. Apple told Forbes: We’re aware of an issue that affects the encryption strength for backups of devices on iOS 10 when backing up to iTunes on the Mac or PC. We are addressing this issue in an upcoming security update. This does not affect iCloud backups. We recommend users ensure their Mac or PC are protected with strong passwords and can only be accessed by authorized users. Additional security is also available with FileVault whole disk encryption.

Boucherie Bears were big winners in their opening game of the BC high school football season. — image credit: Contributed   Kelowna, West Kelowna, Lake Country posted Sep 26, 2016 at 11:00 AM The Mt. Boucherie Bears will look to go 2-0 to start the B.C. high school football regular season on Friday night at the Apple Bowl. At 6:30 p.m., the Bears will host the Centennial Centaurs (1-0) in Eastern Conference AAA action. While the Centaurs opened with a win over WJ Mouat, the Bears were dominant in 42-6 drubbing of Mission to kick off the regular season on Friday night at the Apple Bowl. Boucherie head coach Mike Godwin was pleased with the final result but said his club could have been better in certain areas. "Even though we won, the coaches aren't very pleased with our overall effort. We had a few guys that were outstanding for us, (Nick Kopp, Mark Schuppener, and Hunter Desson) but we also had a few guys really disappoint," said Godwin. "We played much better against Wenatchee and I think a few of our guys got a little cocky. Centennial will be a much stronger test than Mission I think. We need to get back to basics and focus on fundamentals if we want to compete in our division.” Taylor Knoll, Ethan Beselt and Jesse Benneke each scored a pair of majors for the Bears who jumped to a 21-0 first quarter lead. Benneke, who scored on runs of 54 and seven yards, rushed for 108 yards on 11 carries. Beselt returned an interception 64 yards for a TD. Hunter Desson and Chris Smith also had picks, while Wyatt Fagan and Spencer Lindhold each recovered a fumble. Nick Kopp had seven tackles. Lord Tweedsmuir 47 KSS Owls 0 The Owls didn't have much to celebrate Friday in their regular season home opener, as they were shutout by Tweedsmuir. "It was definitely a learning experience for all of us," said Owls' head coach Chris Cartwright. "As a young team we are learning new things everyday.  We are still trying to establish an identity that we can be proud of. We need to understand the work ethic required if we want to be competitors in the AAA Eastern Conference." KSS (0-1) will look to regroup this weekend when they travel to the Lower Mainland Saturday afternoon to take on Mission Secondary (0-1). Fulton 35 RSS Voodoos 28 A good crowd for Rutland's homecoming saw the Voodoos battle to the finish in a see-saw exhibition affair against the visitors from Vernon. The Maroons scored a touchdown late in the fourth quarter for the margin of victory. "Tough loss, good learning experience," said Voodoos coach Peter McCall. "We played a full game today with a lot of new guys in different positions. "As far as exhibition games go, it was a excellent test for a lot of new players. Lots of learning experiences today." Brayden Anderson was key on all sides of the ball for RSS making 16 solo tackles, rushing for 40 yards, catching four passes for 122 yards, returning a kick 40 yards and scoring three touchdowns. Matt Klak rushed for 182 yards and, while Kyle Solloway had four catches for 55 yards and a two-point convert to tie the game with under two minutes remaining. Shadrach Mangondo had a drive stopping interception and 4 tackles from his safety postiion and some great blocks at receiver that led to big runs. Quarterback Zach Hemmett was 11 of 18 for 189 passing yards, while safety Shadrach Mangondo had a drive stopping interception and four tackles on defence. The Voodoos will kick off the regular season Saturday, Oct. 8 at Earl Marriot.   We encourage an open exchange of ideas on this story's topic, but we ask you to follow our guidelines for respecting community standards.

We wish everyone the best of holidays and a prosperous 2017! HPE and Apple: The Speed of Image Transformation By Rob Enderle Sep 26, 2016 10:26 AM PT Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Apple are very different companies this decade, having shifted their models from a strategic customer/innovation focus to one that's more tactical -- and tied far more closely to quarterly profit. They are hardly alone, and this speaks to why Michael Dell and Joe Tucci worked so hard to take their companies private, because this unfortunate trend is not tied to any one industry or any one country. Both HPE and Apple increasingly are defined not by creative products but by complaining customers. Given their goals, their financial performance by most measures is worse than it was under the prior model, at least long term -- though profitable spikes have allowed insider investors to realize nice returns. Since I've been through this several times before with a variety of companies, I'll share my thoughts on what's going on and why. As always, I'll close with my product of the week, and I'm bringing back an old favorite: The Echo Dot, always the highest-value Echo, now sells for less than US$50. HPE's Changes The HPE changes became evident to me through my involvement in a long-term project interviewing IT managers who have switched vendors. A common theme has come up in the reports from HPE accounts post-split: HPE largely is not responsive to their problems; it fields relatively inexperienced support staff; and is a huge pain to work with. This shouldn't be a surprise: HPE has been laying off huge numbers of people. That tends to result in folks not wanting to take responsibility, because related problems might get them on a layoff list. HPE is being sued for discrimination because of a policy that replaces experienced older staff with inexperienced younger staff. HPE is massively siloed, which passes solution responsibility for projects that cross siloes to the customer. Regardless of the competitor, HPE now is defined negatively, in large part, in areas critical to execution, and customers are upset with the outcome, understandably. However, many HPE accounts seem still to be locked into the firm. That is likely for two reasons: 1) They don't realize that other companies don't engage in the same behavior -- because they are tied to HPE they can't see the difference in customer care between firms; and 2) When you are dedicated to one vendor, it is a real pain to switch. I saw this play out right before IBM collapsed in the late 1980s and early 1990s. I'd reported similar issues to my management -- only to have them laugh at me and point out that IBM sold air, so the customers had to deal with whatever IBM dished out. I left shortly afterward, thinking they were idiots. They got fired shortly after that, and IBM had to undertake a massive change direction or cease to exist, and it is a very different company today. However -- and this was before the Internet -- about five years elapsed between the time the problematic behavior was covered up inside the company and the beginning of the huge mass of customers jumping ship. I expect that with HPE, we are talking months. Apple's Shift Apple's shift started with Steve Jobs' passing. Tim Cook moved from what was a heavily innovation- and customer-focused marketing strategy to one that was focused more tightly on top and bottom line growth. The last truly "magical" product was the iPad, and that magic, along with related sales, started going south shortly after Steve's death. The Apple Watch remains largely an expensive and relatively unpopular offering (compared to products like the iPod, iPad and iPhone), and the new iPhone currently is being defined by a screwy hiss and the lack of a headphone jack. Sadly, this iPhone is arguably the best in market -- thanks to the Samsung Galaxy Note7's new feature of becoming a mini-weapon of minor destruction. Customer complaints seem to define the products more than any messaging from Apple, and this is all due to a similar source -- a focus on cost containment rather than customer excitement. I saw this with Apple once before: In the 1990s, long after Steve Jobs was fired, Apple kept plugging away until Windows 95 launched, and it started to become clear the company was months away from going under. It took a very similar marketing and product approach to what Apple once had to cause Microsoft to flip so that customers saw it differently. The Overriding Problem Behind all of this is a bigger problem that goes beyond Apple and HPE: We have shifted corporate ownership form folks like you and me to large hedge funds that operate on a razor edge of legality -- often drifting into insider trading) -- and drive executive compensation to favor their needs over our needs as customers or investors. These people don't care if the company survives, or if customers or employees are happy. Their focus is on spiking the stock, up or down, in a fashion that they can anticipate in order to make profits. In effect, they are gaming the system to the detriment of pretty much everyone except the executives who, increasingly, work for them. We the consumers are getting screwed in the process. Wells Fargo's Scandal You saw this at the heart of the Wells Fargo scandal. Incentives were created to create false records of success in order to make the firm look more successful than it was. The folks who got shot weren't the ones who set up the system -- they were poor saps who got tricked into playing by the rules they were given. This eventually could end up killing Wells Fargo, but those really responsible took their profits, and most of them likely are long gone. This is the world we live in now -- where the criminals run the companies. When scandals break, their unwitting minions get shot, while they simply move on to the next victim. I'm not just seeing this unfortunate behavior nationally but internationally, and its potential adverse impact on the market, jobs, customer satisfaction and the world economy is massive. I continue to be concerned that we look at events like Wells Fargo's fraud and act as if they are isolated. It's kind of like looking at the Zika virus and assuming each patent is unique, and pretending it didn't have the potential to become a pandemic. Oh wait... Wrapping Up: So What Do You Do? As an employee, you need to watch for this behavior in your management -- and if you see it, look for a job elsewhere before you become a victim. Every time I've left a company in trouble, I've found I should have left earlier. I've spoken to a ton of ex-HPE staffers who can't believe they waited so long to leave, referring to their employment at the firm as the most painful time of their lives. As a customer, don't lock in to any one vendor. I'd favor private firms over public at the moment, or until we solve the hedge fund ownership problem. That lets you more accurately see when your care is degrading, so you can respond accordingly. As an Apple customer, I'm not yet suggesting you switch. Samsung showcases that the grass isn't always greener on the other side. Still, you don't have to buy every new product, and sometimes the product you have will be better for you -- and certainly cheaper -- than that brand new product. This is ironic for me, because if I were an iPhone 6 owner, I would get the iPhone 7 -- that waterproof feature alone is worth the price of admission. Make your own choices, though, and realize that eventually -- as it did in the 1990s -- Apple likely will lose you as a customer. So, favor third-party apps over Apple's, so you aren't locked in and can move when it becomes more obvious that you need to. In short, avoid lock-in like the plague, both in consumer and enterprise products. Things change, and you want to be able to take the best path -- not the only path available to you -- when that happens. Amazon is well on the way to owning IoT for the consumer market, thanks largely to its Echo family of offerings. I was an early Echo adopter, and my favorite Echo is the Dot. It gives you speaker choice, and you can add a battery (you now can buy a nested battery for it). Its hands-free voice features make it ideal for the pool or beach, and it is the least expensive way to get into the Echo line. Amazon Echo Dot Well, it just got a ton cheaper, because Amazon has dropped the price of the second-generation Echo to $49.95. Oh, and the built-in speaker isn't bad. I take mine and wirelessly connect it to a Bluetooth boombox, and it makes a great outdoor solution. I connect it to a Sonos bridge to allow it to control music inside my home. Amazon has added considerable IoT functionality to the Echo, so you now can use your voice to control lights and other connected devices, and you increasingly can have conversations with it as it drifts to becoming more of a digital assistant. At $49, the Echo Dot now makes sense for more rooms of your house, and it becomes a far more viable Christmas gift for your technology-challenged relatives. I've always loved the Dot and bargains. Connect the two, and suddenly you have a great product of the week.

All but calling Apple's annual iPhone upgrades incremental, Maher said that if Apple truly wanted to do something innovative, they'd refrain from releasing a new iPhone every year. DON'T MISS: Every video game launching this fall that you need to know about "The next time Apple wants to do something truly innovative and really think different they should try not releasing a new phone," Maher said. "Because somebody has to teach Americans that we don't always have to have something newer, better every year, or in the case of our upside down economic system, every quarter." Maher went on to say that Apple doesn't really care about end users and only releases new products as a means to elevate its share price and appease demanding shareholders. Hardly a controversial point, Tim Cook is obligated by law to operate with the best interests of the company's shareholders in mind. "The only people who really need you to get a new phone every year are the shareholders," Maher added. "But just because they need to sell it so they can [pump up] the stock price doesn't mean you have to stand in that nerd line and buy it. You’re not early adapting. In fact, quite the opposite, you’re taking too long to catch on." Full video of Maher's rant on Apple -- which has quite a few pointed and hilarious jabs-- can be seen below. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4X3OSd6HzY Trending right now: Galaxy S7 edge explodes in the Philippines Please don’t drill a headphone jack into your iPhone 7 The Pixel phones may not be the most interesting thing Google unveils next month See the original version of this article on BGR.com Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share What to Read Next 9 tech-friendly gifts for people obsessed with travel Yahoo Tech CNN uses screenshot from ‘Fallout 4’ to show how Russians hack things BGR News Facebook launches live 360-degree video feature Yahoo Tech LG is ready to make the future more colorful with its Super UHD TVs at CES 2017 Digital Trends The battle between SSD and HDD is over, and the winner is clear Digital Trends Celebrity sues Tesla, claims Model X drove itself through a wall and into his house BGR News Privacy |Terms |About our Ads |Suggestions Brought to you by Yahoo Finance

The new OS marks another stage in the Mac's evolution, and introduces a certain well-known digital assistant to the desktop too. Read on for New Atlas' macOS Sierra review. That headline feature – the arrival of Siri in macOS (no longer OS X) – is likely to be what you notice first and what you spend most of your time playing around with once you've got Sierra installed. But how helpful you find Siri to be depends on what you use your Mac for and how comfortable you are chatting with an AI entity living inside your laptop or desktop. It's not really something we've found ourselves turning to all that much, but it has some nice tricks up its sleeve (such as the option to pin Siri results to the Notification Center pane). Unlike Cortana in Windows 10, there's no text entry fallback for Siri, which can come in handy if you're in a coffee shop or just not in a very talkative mood. There's no doubt the list of what Siri can do in macOS Sierra is impressive: everything from turning Bluetooth on and off to finding files on your machine (plus all the usual web search features you'll know from iOS). We just haven't used it much since installing the first beta edition back in June. Aside from Siri, using Sierra is a smooth and pleasing experience, as you might expect from an Apple product that's been refined and evolved over so many years. Visual and interface tweaks are kept down to a minimum, and it takes some digging around before you uncover all of the new features on offer. I wasn't able to test one of them, Auto Unlock with the Apple Watch, because I didn't have an Apple timepiece to hand. We're sure it works as advertised though, and based on our experience unlocking Chromebooks with a trusted Android phone, it's going to make logging in much more painless. Smart move, Apple. Going beyond the desktop One upgrade that is noticeable is the extra iCloud integration, an area Apple can't really ignore if it wants to keep up with the Googles and Microsofts of this world. macOS Sierra has the option to automatically sync your desktop and Documents folder across iCloud, and move older files to the cloud to free up space locally. Both features get a big thumbs up from us and work very smoothly (though I only have one Mac and one iPhone to assess them on). They are also dependent on you having enough iCloud storage space free. The option to shift older files to iCloud is part of a new storage optimization section in macOS Sierra, and it's combined with other handy tools, such as settings to clean up junk files that are no longer needed, erase local copies of iTunes movies and shows you've watched, and empty the trash automatically. All very useful, and together with the introduction of Siri, a sign that macOS is now about way more than just the local machine you're currently working on. We should also mention the new Universal Clipboard that lets you copy and paste items between macOS and iOS 10 devices with ease, a feature we've already made good extensive of. Sierra is by no means a huge leap forward for Apple's desktop OS – those days are probably gone for good – but it comes with some genuinely smart bells and whistles that most Mac owners are going to approve of. It's easier to find what you need with Siri, it works better with other Macs and Apple devices, and it does more work in the background to keep out of your way – improvements that it's hard to grumble about or find fault with. macOS Sierra apps Picture-in-picture is a handy feature – if you can find it Apple continues to insist on updating all of its desktop applications at the same time as macOS (which seems strange to us, but what do we know?). As on iOS 10, Photos and Music get the biggest upgrades, though Safari has learned a useful new trick too. That's picture-in-picture mode, so you can keep an eye on the video content of your choice while you're supposed to be working. In operation it's slick and stable, with the only problem being it can be hard to find. While a PiP button appears on Vimeo clips, on YouTube it's hidden behind not one but two right-click menus. Meanwhile the likes of Netflix and Hulu don't have it at all at the time of writing. Still, it's early days, and if you can actually find the option then it works well. Back to Photos, which gets all of the upgrades we saw in iOS 10: smart searches, face recognition, and the Memories feature that automatically combines your best pictures into highlights packages based around particular times and dates. As we said about the changes in the mobile OS, it finally feels like Apple knows what it's doing with photos – and it's about time. The smart searching feature work really well, so you can pick out sunsets or cats or your favorite people instantly, and iCloud Photo Library (introduced last year) is more intuitive and sensible than the old Photo Stream approach. Having let Photos loose on our own snaps, the app did a decent job of getting everything sorted around particular events, though admittedly it didn't have much to work with. There are tons of apps and services that will do similar jobs for you now, and while Apple's solution is fine, it hardly stands out in a crowded field – it's just convenient, if you're using macOS and iOS. We're not big fans of automatic photo curation, Apple-made or otherwise, but there are plenty of manual options to make use of, and the smart sorting really does prove its worth once you get used to it. As for Apple Music, it basically just gets a new lick of paint, but it's an impressive one. Everything is clearer and more well presented, although the central foundations of iTunes continue to look rather creaky. The Sierra difference In these days of free, incremental OS updates, there's not as much to talk about in reviews like this as there used to be. If your Mac can run Sierra (models from late 2009 onwards) then you're of course going to install the new software and most likely going to love it too. The addition of Siri is the big change, and even if you don't feel inclined to spend a lot of your time chatting to your computer, it's one more reason to stick with Apple across laptops, desktops, tablets and phones (note a similar expansion of Google Now and Cortana in recent times). We haven't made much use of Siri over the last three months but Apple's engineers have undoubtedly done a good job with its implementation, and some of the tricks it's capable of are genuinely useful rather than gimmicky. The iCloud upgrades – even more useful than Siri, in our experience – are also signs of a changing computing landscape, where the machine sitting on your desk is just one part of a larger experience controlled over the web. Google's Chrome OS project is looking less crazy with each passing year. A really strong upgrade this time around from Apple then. There's not a lengthy list of new features, but what additions there have been are all smart and well implemented, and it plugs some of the most obvious gaps to once again go head-to-head against Windows, Cortana and OneDrive.

You can change your light bulbs to “connected” bulbs that talk to a bridge over Wi-Fi, or you can replace your light switches with “connected” switches that take the same bridge approach. The Lutron Caséta kit takes the latter approach by replacing your existing light switches with smart switches that make your traditional light bulbs work with Siri. There are notable differences between both approaches including cost and ease-of-setup which I’ll unpack below. And if bells and whistles don’t impress you, Lutron takes the crown for having the most elegant solution to HomeKit lighting with one exception… Its product name: Lutron Caséta Wireless Smart Lighting In-Wall Dimmer Kit (HomeKit-enabled). I’ll stick with Lutron Caséta for the remainder of this review.🙂 If you’re exploring Apple’s HomeKit and want to upgrade your home lighting, you may think of Philips Hue first but Lutron Caséta has a few benefits over the Philips approach. For example, Lutron replaces the light switches in your home, not the light bulbs, so you can likely use your existing bulbs which may be cheaper than Hue bulbs. This is especially beneficial when one light switch controls multiple bulbs. Aside from potential price savings, replacing the light switches and not the light bulbs tends to be more elegant and easier to operate. Take my office lights for example. My ceiling has two bulbs that connect to one wall switch. Using the Philips system, I can replace both bulbs for $15/each then control them with my iPhone or Apple Watch, but this requires leaving the wall switch in the ‘on’ position. Turn the switch to ‘off’ and HomeKit can no longer control the lights because they have no power. The solution is to add a Philips Hue Dimmer Switch for $25. This also helps kids and family members control the lights without using Siri or apps. Price comparisons can vary depending on your needs, but Lutron’s solution is the simplest after installation. You have a single light switch that anyone can control versus two light switches with one that you ignore and must leave on. I say Lutron is the simplest after installation because it’s much easier to set up Philips Hue. Installing Lutron requires turning off the power to the room where you’re working, removing the existing light switch, and installing the Caséta switch. The installation process is well documented and only takes about 10 minutes once you get the hang of it, but I spent about an hour my first time as I wanted to be especially careful replacing a wall switch for the first time. The switch itself features four buttons: on, brighter, dimmer, and off. On and off have full width buttons in the usual locations: top and bottom. A middle button is split in half with a nub on the brighter control to make it easy to feel in the dark. Seven green LED lights are always dimly lit to show that everything is connected properly and to serve as a guide for the switch in dark rooms. These LED lights are only visible when the light is on when you change brightness to indicate what percentage you’re picking. I’m not a huge fan of LED status lights on technology. Apple does LED lights tastefully but most companies are way too liberal with LED lights. This became enough of a problem for me (my home office looked like the cockpit of a jet plane at night) that I stuffed my networking hardware in a couple of Bluelounge CableBoxes. Lutron’s powered bridge connects to your router via Ethernet and features a wraparound white LED light to signal that everything is working OK. It’s way more Apple-y with its thin white strip versus the Philips Hue bridge which has multiple blue LED lights. If LED lights don’t bother you, the Lutron bridge is better designed and doesn’t look cheap (but mine stays out of sight). It works just as well and there’s no light pollution. Lutron Caséta also includes a Pico Remote Control that works just like the in-wall light switch. These are great for nightstands especially in a kid’s room or in my case out of sight but in arm’s reach under my desk. Using the wall switch is just like using a traditional wall switch, Siri and the Home app are convenient in certain contexts, and the included remote is a neat add-on. The dimmer kit I tested includes hardware for two rooms. I used the second wall switch in the kitchen where the overhead lights include five bulbs. The included remote is really nice if we sit down for breakfast and decide turning the light on would be nice, and my three-year-old can use it. You can also slide these off the stand if you want a more pocket-friendly remote. Back in the office, Lutron controls two overhead lightbulbs and grouping treats these as one. The light bulbs are basic ones that can be bought anywhere light bulbs are sold. A lot of hardware stores still don’t carry connected bulbs which can be inconvenient. Even though you don’t need Wi-Fi connected bulbs, you still need to pay attention to which bulbs you buy when you use Lutron Caséta. Setting up Lutron required some research after the wall switch was in place because of buzzing that happens with certain bulbs. You’ll need LED dimmable bulbs for the best results and even then some bulbs work better than others. Lutron customers document their successes online and the company has a useful tool for picking the right bulbs. I used Sylvania dimmable Ultra LED 60w replacement A19 (~$10) and heard little to no hum and full compatibility with dimming. Dimmable LED bulbs are recommended and incandescent bulbs (the outdated kind) and halogen bulbs work too. Spirally CFL bulbs are usually cheaper than LED bulbs but won’t work with Lutron. Tom’s Guide has a bulb explainer if you find yourself researching the topic; I’ve settled on LED bulbs throughout. The one thing you miss out on with Lutron and using traditional bulbs is the ability to play with lighting colors. Philips Hue which also works with HomeKit uses their own bulbs with options for color changing lights. Colored bulbs are pricier however so in my own home, which has both Philips and Lutron in different rooms, I’ve opted for cheaper white bulbs when adding new Hue lights. In terms of smarts, Lutron features a nicely designed app for the iPhone and Apple Watch. You need the iOS app to set up the bridge and add new accessories, then you can rely on Apple’s new Home app in iOS 10 to manage HomeKit settings and control your lights. Voice control with Siri using phrases like “Siri, turn my office lights on” or “Set the office lights to 50% brightness” work just as you would expect, and you can create scenes and automations to make Lutron even smarter. For example, my “I’m home” scene turns on the inside lights with a voice command or button tap (and you could optionally enable this with geofencing using your location) and “Good night” ensures all of the lights are turned off. Automation in the Home app for iOS 10 lets you use events like time of day and sunrise or sunset to control your lights too. The best alarm in the morning for me is bright lighting so I start my weekday with my house lighting up at 5 a.m. thanks to Lutron’s HomeKit connectivity. Lutron also works with other smart home services and devices like Amazon Echo using Alexa, IFTTT, Logitech Harmony, Xfinity Home, Nest (review), ecobee (review), and many more so you’re not locked in to Apple’s platform. There’s also newly announced Sonos connected speaker integration that I can’t wait to try out soon. Lutron Caseta Wireless Smart Lighting In-Wall Dimmer Kit with HomeKit support retails for $189.99 from Amazon, Best Buy, Apple, and other retailers. The LED bulbs that I used in my review are Sylvania dimmable Ultra LED 60w replacement A19 (~$10). You can also buy a Plug-In Lamp version of the same kit for the same price, and additional In-Wall Dimmers and Plug-In Lamp Dimmers retail for $59.99 and include Pico Remote Controls as well. Overall, Lutron Caséta takes a little more effort during setup but offers a more Apple-like solution with smart light switches that work with traditional light bulbs. Avoiding two light switches is far more elegant than the Philips Hue approach although you lose the ability to control colors. Here’s a visual demonstration of how on/off looks with Lutron Caséta: notice the nearly instant on then slow fade to off My HomeKit setup includes both systems but I would recommend taking a serious look at Lutron Caséta if you’re just getting started. I’ll likely add at least two more In-Wall Dimmers to my bathrooms, for example, as the $60 light switches are $10 cheaper (and way more elegant) than three $15 bulbs and a $25 remote switch. Which system is actually more cost-effective for you will depend on your own needs (and preferences), but on presentation alone Lutron Caséta is the clear winner and worth your consideration.

Apple’s online store will begin selling the Play:1 ($199) and Play:5 ($499, reviewed) later today, and Apple’s physical stores will carry the two speakers starting October 5. At Sonos, we believe that music deserves a central place in our lives and in our homes. Playing music out loud makes everything better – more profound, joyful, meaningful and affirming. The easier we make it to fill your home with music, the more people will listen. We’re very excited to announce today that we’re making it easier than ever by expanding our collaboration with Apple and bringing Sonos into Apple’s physical and online retail stores. Two of our most popular speakers — the PLAY:1 and PLAY:5 — will be available later today at Apple.com in the USA, at 468 Apple Stores around the world starting October 5, and Apple.com in the coming weeks in most markets outside of the USA. Better still, those who buy a Sonos system at Apple retail stores or at Apple.com between today and December 31 will receive a free three-month Apple Music Gift Card. Sonos enables Apple Music streaming directly to the wireless speakers without Bluetooth or AirPlay from another device; your iPhone or Mac is simply the controller. Sonos also provides multi-room playback and automation that can’t be accomplished on iOS alone. Sonos is bringing voice control to the speaker system through Amazon Echo, integrating with Spotify app Sonos Controller for iOS gains lock screen control access, new 3D Touch + Split View features, more Sonos to officially support Apple Music starting tomorrow Sonos upgrades flagship Play:5 HiFi wireless speaker with new design, overhauled sound; unveils Trueplay tuning software Last year when I had a chance to talk to Sonos CEO John MacFarlane, I asked why Sonos wasn’t already in Apple retail stores: Finally, I asked why such an Apple-like company as far as design and experience goes isn’t present in Apple Stores. Is it lack of Bluetooth or AirPlay, or something else? The short answer is that there has been talk in this space in the past, but there hasn’t been a compelling reason for both Apple and Sonos yet. For one, multi-room playback is difficult to demo in busy Apple Stores, but Best Buy and Target do okay with selling Sonos speakers, right? Apple Music could be the missing link for both parties, though, as selling Sonos speakers would be another point to promote Apple Music subscriptions. Makes sense. Since then, Sonos has opened its first retail store of its own in New York City, and Apple Stores carrying Sonos speakers is a major endorsement of the products. It just got easier to #listenbetter.

We put this water resistance to the test on video in our recent post about the top iPhone 7 features. Some people have also wondered how cases might fare when subjected to water. A case like Apple’s iPhone 7 Silicone Case would be okay, but I certainly wouldn’t recommend submerging Apple’s iPhone 7 Leather Case. What about the iPhone 7 Smart Battery Case? It features the same material used in the silicone case, yet includes a 2365 mAh battery sealed inside. Is it safe to get the Smart Battery Case wet? Apple’s official response to that question is a very unambiguous no. Yet, that didn’t stop AirParrot Remote developer, Squirrels, from testing the limits of the case’s potential water resistance while on a company retreat. Apple’s official stance on getting the Smart Battery Case wet is clear, as it’s mentioned several times in the instructions that ship with the case: Don’t open, remove, crush, puncture, or short circuit the Smart Battery Case, or expose it to fire, high temperatures, or liquids. Don’t connect or disconnect the Smart Battery Case or a Power Adapter with wet hands. Unplug the Smart Battery Case if any of the following conditions exist: The case of iPhone is damaged, exposed to rain, liquid, excessive moisture, or needs service or repair. In addition, someone decided to ask Apple Support on Twitter about how the case interacts with water: @tverschoren Not waterproof, you will find additional information here: https://t.co/eABBqst2I6 — Apple Support (@AppleSupport) September 21, 2016 So yes, it’s very clear that you should, according to official Apple documentation, absolutely steer clear of water when charging your iPhone. Yet, due to the fact that the iPhone 7 is IP67-certified — meaning it can be submerged for up to 30 minutes in up to 1 meter of static water — it might be tempting to put peripherals, like the Smart Battery Case, to the test. But you really shouldn’t do this. Apple’s documentation makes it abundantly clear that you shouldn’t get the Smart Battery Case wet, and that you definitely shouldn’t charge your iPhone while it is wet, even if it’s being charged by the Smart Battery Case, and not the typical AC outlet. Electricity and water, right? We review the iPhone 7 Smart Battery Case + subscribe to our YouTube channel Still, curiosity can make it easy to disregard even the clearest of warnings, which is why the development team at Squirrels decided to put the iPhone 7 Smart Battery Case to the test. (To be clear, Squirrels is not endorsing such activity, but wanted to share their findings with me, as they knew I’d be interested in the results.) The Squirrels team submerged the new iPhone 7 Smart Battery case in: a pool at 2-feet deep for 30 minutes Florida Gulf Coast saltwater at 1-foot deep for an hour a hot tub at 1-foot for 30 minutes Needless to say, that’s a pretty extreme series of tests, but the Smart Battery Case came out relatively unscathed. It’s also worth noting that this test is making me long for another beach vacation ⛱. Apple’s iPhone 7 Smart Battery Case is epoxy-sealed, which helps keep the inside dry Squirrels does warn that cheaper Lightning cables are subject to corrosion when wet, while Apple’s own Lightning connector didn’t encounter any issues with corrosion. In other words, you’ll want to make sure that the case is completely dry before attempting to charge again, especially if using third-party cables. It held up well, but it’s still not a good idea to get the Smart Battery Case wet Further, Squirrels discovered that the case’s internal components are epoxy sealed, which help provide liquid ingress protection. When considering the case’s build materials, it’s not totally surprising that it held up well under these conditions. In fact, many found that the iPhone 6s could stand up to water much better than expected, even though Apple wouldn’t acknowledge any level of water resistance. What can we learn from this test? Despite how well the case fared, it’s still not a smart idea to get your iPhone 7 Smart Battery case wet to any degree, and you’ll definitely want to avoid charging the case or your iPhone until it’s dry if it happens to get wet. But it’s nice to see that if you do have an accident that causes the case to get wet, it’s not necessarily the end of the world for the $99 accessory. Simply allow it adequate time to completely dry before trying to use it again.

autoevolution cars moto news car reviews spyshots driven cars newspaper green Compare Cars BAC Calculator   Editorial Coverstory Motorsport Testdrives archive Auto Shows Tuning Car Finder Photo of the Day Glossary of automotive terms Masthead RSS Feeds Why Apple and McLaren Should Probably Not Hook Up   26 Sep 2016, 17:20 UTC · by Alex Oagana / Home / News / Editorial At first glance, probably everyone believed that this could be one of those “marriages made in heaven,” with only but winners to emerge from a buyout of McLaren by a giant like Apple. Truthfully, I almost had a similar reaction upon reading the Financial Times report, whose main idea has been since refuted by McLaren in a very elegant manner. On one side, we have a company so rich that has a cash reserve larger than the GDP of whole countries. On the other, McLaren Technology Group consists of a number of businesses that most would say have achieved excellence in almost every field they touched. For those not exactly in the know, McLaren is not just a supercar maker and a successful Formula 1 team with pedigree, since the McLaren Technology Group is actually a conglomerate of five businesses and partnerships. This means that if Apple would ever decide to spend a tiny little snippet of those 200+ billion dollars it has on hand just to venture into the automotive business, there are considerably worse choices than McLaren. Just think about it. Apple is mostly known for its i-branded lines of iconic consumer electronics and software, and those are the products it bases its ginormous fortune on. That said, times change, and so does consumer behavior, so Apple is slowly but surely trying to keep a grasp on its sizable amount of customers and even increase it via other business ventures. One of them is the mysterious Project Titan, which until a few months ago was supposed to translate in the first ever Apple car. Since then, it seems that the Cupertino giant has somewhat changed its focus concerning this virgin field, with a lot of layoffs signaling trouble for the car project. An alliance or downright buyout of the McLaren Technology Group would most definitely spell good fortune for Project Titan, no matter if Apple wants to make a self-driving car to jump on the same autonomous bandwagon that Google is attacking or an electric car to rival Tesla and whatever Faraday Future is cooking. What could co wrong, then? Well, the answer is pretty simple, actually. Everybody is talking about how much would Apple benefit from McLaren, not the other way around. We all use smartphones and computers, but first and foremost we are car lovers here, not necessarily consumer electronics geeks. I'm pretty sure that so are most McLaren fans and buyers out there. So, from McLaren's perspective, what would an Apple takeover mean for the British conglomerate? Firstly, it would mean that a lot more money would suddenly become available for its own ventures in racing, the automotive business, and other projects. That's the good news. The bad news is that, even though Ron Dennis would probably remain CEO, he wouldn't be the top boss anymore. McLaren would turn into another subsidiary of a large company, with just about any decision regarding investment having to be acknowledged by Cupertino. In layman terms, it would hand over the controls to a company that knows next to zero about the automotive business and motorsport. Obviously thanks to the money and therefore power it has over people, Apple has slowly transformed in the recent decade in one of the most arrogant tech companies out there. Words like “courage” and “innovation” are present in just about every presentation from Cupertino, and it usually involves a product that loses an “old and decrepit” feature just to go against the industry standards and introduce some of its own. What if this downright cancerous corporate culture would put its mark on McLaren as well? “Meet the new McLaren i8, it's just what you've always wanted but never knew it. We've removed the brake and accelerator and replaced them with touch sensitive surfaces that resemble the feel of pedals. Instead of a windshield and roof, an innovative type of blow dryer emits a current of air that simply keeps the passengers away from the elements, including rain. You can also say goodbye to holding an age-old steering wheel since we've replaced it with a courageous stereo camera that tracks your hand movements and turns the car wherever you're pointing your fingers. Everything is easy, just like you've always wanted.” Jokes aside, the loss of full control of McLaren's destiny is probably not worth the heaps of money this type of transaction would bring to Woking. Sure, Ron Dennis only owns about a quarter of McLaren Technology Group nowadays, but apart from having to please more shareholders, he is still the Big Kahuna. That would likely no longer happen if Apple gets the full power, and it would be a shame. Dennis has a fair share of haters and has always been berated for its verbose statements, also known as “Ronspeak.” Even so, he is still the sole reason for the company's successes in the last 35 years or so, ever since he first became the team principal of the McLaren Formula 1 team.

It's not always easy to conduct a yearly assessment on a certain topic, and when it comes to automotive trends, it's probably even harder. Not to say that I consider myself a fine connoisseur of global tendencies in this area, but my job does include reading just about every single piece of automotive news I can get by grubby hands on. In other words, I'm probably allowed to offer my opinion about the evolution of electric and/or self-driving cars over the course of 2016. Oh, but wait! There are plenty of production electric cars on the road right now, but is there such a thing as a production autonomous car? Some, if not most, will probably say no. I'm happy to oblige in having a similar opinion, up to a point. Adding more to that line of t... Read more... Why “Special Edition” Cars Aren't Usually Worth Your Money I'm aware that I probably sound like a grumpy old man that wants all these new special edition cars off his lawn, but there are two problems with that line of thought. Firstly, I don't actually hate special edition cars, or at least not all of them. Secondly, I don't have a lawn, mainly because I live in a flat. Getting back to how special and limited edition cars are destroying the polar ice caps, stealing from poor people and ruining Christmas, I have come to the conclusion that a lot of them are simply useless. Well, pretty much all cars are useless in the sense that they're not worth the money after reaching a certain level, but limited edition models usually reach that level a hell of a lot sooner. No, I get it, special/lim... Read more... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Autonomous Cars I know what most of you are going to say. Riding in the back of a car, no matter how fantastic its Nurburgring time is or how quickly it can do the quarter mile, is boring. Any true petrolhead will say that he or she has a similar opinion and that sitting anywhere inside a vehicle apart from just behind the steering wheel is tedious. Which is why they will also say that they truly hate the advent of automated driving and hope that driverless car will never become a thing. I must confess that my way of thinking wasn't that much different until recently. “What's up with these autonomous cars, aren't they like horizontal elevators? Elevators aren't fun,” or something along those lines. But then it hit me. A similar thing happened a ... Read more... Do We Really Want Electric Supercars? I know I'm not the only one who has started to notice a trend in recent years, but I'm probably among the few that sees this common tendency with a pair of worried eyes. I'm talking about the proliferation of all-electric sports cars, supercars, hypercars or megacars, whatever you want to call them. It's not that I'm against them, or electricity as means of propulsion in general, but I'm positive (pun intended) that we should draw the line at some point. Arguably, the biggest drawback of electric cars was their appalling range, which was easily beaten by a fat cyclist running on hot dogs until not that long ago. There was no problem regarding performance no matter how much horsepower they had, mainly thanks to that impressive instant torque at zero rpm that ... Read more... A Story about Expensive Car Warranties and Respect This may come as a surprise for some folks out there, but you need to realize that there are things in life whose value can be quantified in more than one way, and not everything costs money. “But cars cost money, don't they?” you will so candidly ask me. Sure they do, but that doesn't mean that every car out there has a value that can be translated directly into cold, hard, cash. Look at classic cars, or at modern supercars. In the case of the former, their monetary value can go up or down depending on the overall market's tendency. Not only that, what could be worth millions for one person could also be worth peanuts for somebody else. This is probably why it's pretty hard to quantify the value of a classic car, and why professional appraisals... Read more... Could Volkswagen Group's Electric Plans Include Ducati? The Dieselgate scandal sent shockwaves in the automotive industry and revealed that not everyone had been playing fair in this game. Obviously, Volkswagen is the manufacturer that took the biggest hit, and it looks only fair that they should pay dearly for their trickery. With around billions to be spent fixing the Dieselgate aftermath, and more backlashes to be dealt with in the mid-term future, VW has to fall back to the positions they can defend more easily and the recent declarations made by the group's CEO Matthias Muller indicate that the Germans are exploring new directions. Namely, Volkswagen has big plans to experiment more with electric mobility and BEVs (battery-powered electric vehicles). In a somewhat reserved tone, if not a very cautious one. M... Read more... On Electric Harleys and New Generations It's not about yet one more electric motorcycle making its debut and hoping for the best, but about the fact that one of the world's biggest motorbike manufacturers officialized its intentions of adding an e-bike to its line-up. Of course, somewhat similar attempts have been made in the industry, and H-D is nowhere near the pioneer status. However, the Bar and Shield gets the bonus points for boldness, as they're not going to introduce that motorcycle as a side dish like the C evolution is for BMW. Of course, BMW is not ashamed with that scooter, but you get my point, hopefully. Instead of making electric machinery looking more or less like the retarded third cousin from a small village in the middle of nowhere, Harley-Davidson may be championing in the &quo... Read more... Why Riding in Shorts Is Not THAT Dangerous Summer is approaching quickly in the northern hemisphere and people like me, who use a motorcycle daily to reach their jobs and even shopping are beginning to feel the warmth of the hot season. Personally, I am not a huge fan of heat and that's why I sometimes ride the (not that many) miles between my home and my workplace wearing shorts instead of long pants. And no, I never wear Cordura or leather trousers in the city. Sometimes, mornings are as cold as 6-7 Celsius (43-45 F) and I feel the chill. My helmet, my gloves and the leather jacket manage to keep my body temperature within decent margins and the cold air invigorates me, and the vibe is good. I have never crashed badly because I am constantly on the lookout for dumb, reckless or ignor... Read more... Dovizioso and Lorenzo at Ducati? Obviously, after Lorenzo's announcement that he would be joining Ducati in 2017 and 2018, the tension mounted in the two boxes of the Italian team. The big question is who will be Jorge Lorenzo's teammate from 2017, but answering it is a tricky business. The biggest issue is that both Andrea Dovizioso and Andrea Iannone have strong assets to their sides, even though the shortcomings are not missing either. Clearly not in the same league with the "aliens," the two Andrea are still among the next best riders on the grid, and they'd probably be most welcome on any other team. Ducati has not made any statements that would lead us anywhere, leaving everything to the guessing game. The only declarations mention that both Iannone and Dovizioso are competi... Read more... Lorenzo's Gamble Yesterday's announcement about Yamaha parting ways with the reigning Jorge Lorenzo was no surprise, as the avalanche of hints and paddock whispers transformed the whole thing into a "public secret." However, now that all things are said and done, I can't help thinking about how much of a bet Lorenzo's move is, in fact. He made a radical decision, even before he signed the Ducati contract, and the only way he can retain his aura is to win championships. If anything, I'd say JL99 never felt that he was truly at home at Yamaha, despite having already spent more than eight seasons on the Iwata machine. In fact, Yamaha was the only team Lorenzo had since he stepped up to MotoGP. Still, it looks like his three world titles in the premier class, multiple...

Share via facebook dialog Share via Twitter Share via Pinterest Share via facebook dialog Share via Twitter Share via Pinterest Share via Pinterest YouTube/Jerry Rig Everything When most people get their hands on a new iPhone, they do everything they can to protect it. But when YouTube user JerryRigEverything got an iPhone 7, he pretty much did the opposite. Jerry noticed an odd warning on the Apple site: While the company assured its customers that the new iPhone 7's surface is "as hard as other anodized Apple products," it also said the jet black version of the phone "may show fine micro-abrasions with use." Apple then recommended that customers purchase a case to protect the jet black phone—something it had never done before. This inspired Jerry to conduct a durability test—and pretty much destroy his new iPhone—on camera. First up: He tried his hand at scratching, burning, and bending the matte black iPhone 7. Jerry started by scratching the phone's screen with different razors. He determined that while keys and coins won't scratch the iPhone 7 screen, it's still a good idea to keep it protected—you never know what might be lurking in your pockets. He also scratched the home touchpad, the ear piece, and the camera—all three held up. Keys won't scratch the back of a matte black iPhone 7, but a razor will pretty much destroy it (yes—that one was hard to watch). Jerry also lit his iPhone on fire (not kidding), and noted that the screen could withstand being held to a flame for 10 seconds before the pixels started turning black. That said, shortly after removing the flame, the pixels reappeared and the phone was back to normal—which is pretty badass. Also of note: The iPhone 7 can't bend in half. Which, you know, is important. Then, he had a go at messing up the jet black version. All the same was true of the jet black iPhone 7, which has a glossy finish instead of a matte one. The only problem: The back of the jet black phone is, as Apple warned, incredibly fragile. A toothpick couldn't scratch up the phone's surface, but a penny left some serious scratches. Keys and screws can also wreak havoc on the glossy finish, and even wiping the phone off with your shirt can do damage. Now that you've successfully made it through 10 minutes of watching iPhones get destroyed, some takeaways: If you're looking to snag a new iPhone, you might want to consider getting a matte finish. And if you just can't resist the glossy jet black version (I don't blame you), you'll probably want to heed Apple's advice and get a case for your shiny new gadget. Potential scuffers are everywhere!

X Bulk of Apple’s profits belong in US, says OECD tax chief Pascal Saint-Amans claims profits should be aligned to research and development Mon, Sep 26, 2016, 18:08 Updated: Mon, Sep 26, 2016, 18:09 Eoin Burke-Kennedy OECD’s tax chief Pascal Saint-Amans: said Ireland’s 12.5 per cent corporation tax rate was not under threat from moves to reform the global tax system.         The bulk of profits attributable to Apple’s Irish operations belong in the US, the OECD’s tax chief has said. Pascal Saint-Amans was responding to a question during a visit to Dublin about the European Commission’s recent tax ruling in relation to Apple, which said the Irish Revenue should bill two of the tech giant’s Irish entities €13 billion in back taxes. While Mr Saint-Amans declined to comment directly on the commission’s ruling, he said that, as most of the company’s research and development took place in the US, it was clear profits should be associated with that jurisdiction. “There is no ambiguity here: the bulk of it belongs to the United States, ” he said. Mr Saint-Amans, director of the OECD’s Center for Tax Policy and Administration, was in Dublin for a meeting with Minster for Finance Michael Noonan to exchange views on the international tax agenda. He said he was not surprised at the sum involved given Apple’s level of profitability. Mr Saint-Amans was also asked about the commission’s recent invitation to other EU states to consider whether they were entitled to part of its €13 billion finding against Apple. “What’s the fine tuning? I have no clue. Maybe part of it belongs to Europe and part of what belongs to Europe belongs to Ireland, ” he said. Mr Saint-Amans said Ireland’s 12.5 per cent corporation tax rate was not under threat from moves to reform the global tax system. “There is no questioning of the rates taken by some countries,” he said. “Clearly the US is much too high but I cannot say that Ireland is too low. It’s not. It’s accepted. Even the French have understood that Ireland will not change its tax rate. It’s here and it’s perfectly fine,” he said. Corporation tax Taoiseach Enda Kenny came under strong pressure over the corporation tax rate from France and Germany at the height of the financial crisis back in 2011. Mr Saint-Amans said the implementation of the OECD’s base erosion profit shifting project (Beps) was proceeding, with more than 85 countries now on board. ADVERTISEMENT While the commission’s decision against Apple has put the spotlight back on multinational tax avoidance, it has also raised the risk of significant push-back from the US. “Are we moving to a tax war between two blocs, Americans and Europeans, or are we still in an environment in which we can still build something? My view is that we must ensure we have co-operation among all the countries,” Mr Saint-Amans said. “Clearly for the future we need to have a common set of rules,” he said, noting that revised rules on transfer pricing, where profits are shifted to low tax jurisdictions, would better align profits to economic activity.       Topics: Apple tax Eoin Burke Kennedy Pascal Saint Amans BASE Center For Tax Policy European Commission Oecd Apple Dublin(IE) Ireland United States Read More Inside China’s ‘iPhone City’, the land of sweeteners and perks John McManus: Apple’s adventures in tax wonderland Apple ruling: EU accuses Ireland of inconsistencies on tax rules Apple dismisses tax bill, says Ireland ‘doesn’t do any engineering for us’ Cliff Taylor: Battle lines drawn in State’s EU Apple appeal Court ruling on Spanish tax may give clues to Apple appeal Meet ‘the Maxforce’ – the EU team that fined Ireland €13bn over Apple Apple CEO invited to attend tax ruling hearing in Dublin EU Court asks Government to tweak its Apple tax appeal European Commission refuses to comment on Noonan claims Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Transport & Tourism Why Ryanair is offering package holidays now Work Millennials start new year with old-school paper diaries and pens English Soccer Jermain Defoe double leaves Liverpool frustrated Irish Times After 2016, economic forecasting for 2017 has got to be perilous Sponsored Making a difficult fertility journey a lot less lonely Redbreast Lustau: an old friend with a new whiskey perspective Infertility and the workplace: one woman's experience Do you know how much you’ll save by switching health plan?

By Alistair Charlton September 26, 2016 18:15 BST The Apple Watch could become more of a sleep tracker and less of a bedside clockApple Due to its one-day battery life, the original Apple Watch was unable to track sleep. Unlike simpler fitness trackers such as those from Fitbit and less feature-packed smartwatches from Withings, the Apple Watch remained on its owner's bedside table, charging instead of tracking. The Watch Series Two, which recently went on sale, has laid the foundations to address this by having an improved battery life, and the watchOS 3 software update even makes older Watches more capable of surviving a full 24 hours. But now Apple is getting ready to bring sleep tracking to the Watch, according to sources of Bloomberg. The newspaper, which has a strong track record for accurate Apple news, claims: "The iPhone maker is working on new apps for the Apple Watch. One helps users track sleep patterns." The sleep-tracking app is being developed along with more advanced health-monitoring features and an app that gauges a person's health by timing how long it takes their heart to return from its peak to a resting level after exercise. The Watch can already record a wearer's heart rate when they ask it to, and during exercise, so switching on the new feature would be a logical next step. As for sleep tracking, the Watch could theoretically be switched into a power-saving mode where only the wearer's movement and heart rate are recorded, along with ambient noise to better understand their breathing. The real challenge would be creating a watch (or updating the software of the current one sufficiently) for it to last a full waking day, then record sleep for a night and last well into the second day before needing a recharge. To solve this, Apple might look into changing how their customers habitually charge; launching a desk charger for use at work could train users to top up their watch battery during the day instead of at night. Ultimately, the sources say, Apple's goal "is to turn HealthKit into a tool that improves diagnoses". A watch actively keeping an eye on your health and alerting you (and your doctor) to any problems could give the fitness tracker market the justification it needs to be taken seriously as its products seen as more than running gadgets.

Sep 26, 2016 Share Tweet 0 Drake dropped his Apple Music exclusive short film, Please Forgive Me, which was shot in Johannesburg and Namibia and unsurprisingly features a pretty stacked lineup of contributors. The film is directed by Anthony Mandler who has worked with everyone from Justin Bieber to Taylor Swift and has previously worked with Drake for videos earlier in his career including, "Fancy," "Find Your Love," and "Over." Mandler and producer Kim Bradshaw have collaborated on a few Apple ads together, like Swift's infamous fall on the treadmill, so it makes sense the pair would reunite for Drake's Apple Music exclusive. Apple Music's head of content, Larry Jackson, also co-produced and wrote the film. Related Watch Drake's 'Please Forgive Me' Short Film There's Now a Hilarious Video Game Based on Drake's 'VIEWS' Artwork Interview: Tanisha Scott Talks Choreographing Drake's "Hotline Bling" Video The film stars Drake in the lead role alongside Jamaican dancehall artist Popcaan, who previously contributed to Jamie xx and Young Thug's "Good Times" as well as an early version of Drake’s "Controlla" that didn't make the final album. The rest of the cast includes actor Sonni Chidiebere, who is best known for roles in Blood Diamond and District 9, and model Fanny Neguesha. Also in the film is British singer Kyla Reid, who is best known for singing the song that Drake sampled on "One Dance," which earned them their very first No. 1 song. You might also recognize Swedish twin sisters Elizabeth and Victoria Lejonhjärta because they were handpicked to star alongside Drizzy in his album art for Views. They all hit it off so much that Drake even tattooed their name on him according to a post of theirs, so it's understandable that he would call them back up to star in the video. Also featured in the film is South African stage and screen actor, Jerry Mofokeng, who has appeared in many acclaimed movies including the 2005 Academy Award-winning film, Tsotsi. Rounding out the film's choreographer is none other than Tanisha Scott who is probably best known as the woman behind the now iconic and eternally memeable moves by Drake in the "Hotline Bling" video.

Subscribe to Ubergizmo on Youtube Apple has made a big leap with the iPhone 7 by removing the standard 3.5mm headphone jack that has been present on this handset ever since the first iPhone was released in 2007. The iPhone 7 ships with a new pair of earbuds that feature a Lightning connector which plugs into the only available port on the handset. Apple has completely removed the 3.5mm headphone jack but some believe that it has merely been hidden and that it can be accessed by drilling into the iPhone 7. A prank video has made many people do this to their new iPhones. The prank video suggests that iPhone 7 users can access the standard 3.5mm headphone jack by simply drilling into the bottom of their new phone. The video has been watched more than ten million times and it has legitimately gone viral on the internet. It shows a man drilling into the bottom of an iPhone 7 who claims that this reveals a hidden 3.5mm headphone port. The video shows that the iPhone 7 plays music after the hole has been drilled, but the sound comes from the speakers and not the white headphones that have been plugged into the drilled hole because there’s nothing there. TechRax, the California-based YouTuber, is best known for carrying outrageous experiments on handsets to see if they will survive. He created this video and has since been receiving messages from people who claim to have performed this procedure only to find out that they have been pranked and now have a hole in their new handset. Since they did this voluntarily, it’s not like they can claim a refund from Apple. As Abraham Lincoln once said: “Don’t believe everything you read on the internet.” Filed in Cellphones.

Ikea is to sell smart lightbulbs that can be controlled without getting out of your seat  The TRÅDFRI LED bulb can be dimmed and turned on or off wirelessly Remote control connects directly to bulbs unlike other smart lights Ikea claims up to 10 smart bulbs can be connected around the home By Sean Poulter, Consumer Affairs Editor For The Daily Mail Published: 12:58 EST, 26 September 2016 | Updated: 13:00 EST, 26 September 2016 e-mail 178 shares 27 View comments If getting up to dim or turn off the lights is a chore too far, you will soon be able to do it from the comfort of your seat. Flat-packed furniture giant Ikea has announced it is to release a range of smart light bulbs that can be controlled wirelessly using a remote control. The move promises to take smart lighting, which until now has largely confined to expensive high-end products, into the mainstream. Ikea has revealed it is to start selling smart light bulbs that can be controlled wirelessly using a remote to turn them on, off and dim the light they produce from bright to warm (pictured) A number of manufacturers already sell lighting systems that link to a central hub and the internet and can be controlled through a smartphone app. APPLE'S SIRI HOME CONTROL Apple is reportedly developing its own device similar to the Amazon Echo, which is said to have left the research and development lab and is now being tested as a prototype. This Siri-driven device will control appliances, locks, lights and other areas of the home via voice activation. Apple is attempting to differentiate itself from other firms with more advanced microphone and speaker technology, two people familiar with the matter said. And some of the technology in the prototype includes facial recognition sensors, another said. Apple has also considered integrating mapping information into the speaker, another person said, which could notify users when it is time to leave their house for an appointment. Apple has not yet confirmed that it is developing the device. These are often very expensive and may need an electrician to fit them. The Ikea system is simpler in that the brains sit inside the bulb itself which has a tiny transmitter that links to a remote control. Each remote control can control 10 bulbs around the house. The screw-in LED bulbs are the sort found in room pendant lights and lamps, but Ikea says it will also sell lighting panels and even doors. The lighting options range from a relaxing warm yellow glow through to 'full beam' brightness. The bulbs are the latest innovation from Ikea's 'Home Smart' research, which previously delivered pieces of furniture which work as wireless charging stations for smartphones. A spokesman said: 'It has been developed after research showed that small changes in lighting can have a great impact on people's well-being and intellectual abilities, with cold lighting suited for learning and warm for relaxing. 'The Smart Lighting collection includes LED bulbs, lighting panels and doors.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Say cheese! Uber makes drivers take SELFIES before they can...

'Since the technology developed for switching between light tones and dimming is found inside the bulb itself, TRÅDFRI can be used in any lamp with the standard socket sizes.' Björn Block, Business Leader for IKEA Home Smart said: 'Through home visits and research we identified that existing technology is perceived as being too expensive and difficult to understand.  'With this in mind, we set out to make the TRÅDFRI dimming kit easy to use and affordable.' Ikea says it will also be possible to control the lights using a smartphone app (pictured) but this will require a hub The bulbs and panels will go in to stores in April next year. It has not yet put a price on them. Ikea says it will also be possible to control the lights using a smartphone app but this will require a hub.   Electronics giant Philips has been selling similar bulbs for several years now and offers the opportunity to select colours as well as brightness. These connected bulbs can be controlled using a mobile phone app via a central hub. But a single Philips Hue light bulb can cost £49.99 ($59.99 in the US).    Share or comment on this article e-mail 178 shares Most watched News videos Mariah botches New Year's Eve performance and storms off stage Heart-warming moment woman plays piano and sings in cathedral Man goes crazy when he catches another guy in bed with his wife Woman takes seven minutes to parallel park car in double space Man finally talks to wife after over twenty years of silence Passenger insults flight attendant before being led away by police Disturbing moment pitbull kills small dog in front of its owner Mass brawl erupts between customers and restaurant staff Dog shows off its incredibly efficient banana-eating technique Bottles and furniture thrown during terrifying NYE fight Spooky!

Titled "Please Forgive Me," the short film follows Drake and his girlfriend in the video (Belgian model Fanny Neguesha) as they attempt to make off with a wealthy man's fortune. From Views, the songs "One Dance," "Controlla," "9," "Views," and more are featured. The explosive visual companion to #VIEWS. @drake’s Please Forgive Me. Only on #AppleMusic:https://t.co/86DnYZFruv pic.twitter.com/ANlLgr2imC— Apple Music (@AppleMusic) September 26, 2016 Please Forgive Me will be available to watch on Apple Music "in perpetuity," and is the third video to come out of Views, following the debut of "Hotline Bling" last year and "Childs Play" earlier this month. For one week, Views itself was an Apple Music exclusive, and reportedly sold 1 million copies in its five-day exclusivity window. Recently, Apple began preparing to bolster its video content on Apple Music through the purchase of Carpool Karaoke, and the creation of original programming like Dr. Dre's Vital Signs and the reality competition series Planet of the Apps. Apple iTunes chief Eddy Cue has said Apple is "not trying to create original TV shows" to become a Netflix or Amazon Video competitor, but will "help" producers on projects that are designed to promote its existing products. On the music side of the service, Apple's collection of streaming exclusives has come under fire from labels and music industry critics. Specifically, Universal Music Group CEO Lucian Grainge has prohibited the practice of exclusive music streaming moving forward, meaning popular artists like Kendrick Lamar, Taylor Swift, and The Weeknd could all be removed from future Apple Music exclusivity deals since they each belong to various UMG labels.

Sonos is a popular brand known for offering Wi-Fi connected speakers that are excellent for multi-room home speaker systems. The PLAY:1 ($199) and the PLAY:5 ($499) are expensive speakers, but the simple setup, ease of use, and sound quality can't be beat. "Our expanded collaboration with Apple is a great example of our ongoing work with our full ecosystem of partners to make it easier than ever to listen to music out loud at home," said Patrick Spence, president of Sonos. "Apple Music on Sonos is a powerful experience, one we're proud to bring directly to Apple fans at Apple Stores worldwide."Many Apple stores that sell Sonos systems will be offering hands-on in-store Sonos and Apple Music demos featuring the Sonos app on an iPad Pro. As an incentive for new purchasers, those who buy a Sonos system from Apple between today and December 31 will get a free three-month Apple Music gift card. The PLAY:1 and PLAY:5 will be available for purchase from Apple's online store later today, expanding to 468 retail stores around the world starting on October 5. Online availability in other countries is expected in the coming weeks.

You can access your entire iTunes library from the Sonos app, as well as SiriusXM, Apple Music, and many others. Except if you don't want to be tied to one app. Rating: 19 Votes nikhsub1 14 weeks ago Sonos is a fabulous music distribution system. You can use their self-contained amp/speakers (which, in pairs, can be set up as L/R) or a Sonos amp to power your own speakers. The ability to play music in different rooms (called Zones) or combine them together is amazing. If you love music, Sonos is for you. I've had it in my house for about 6 years (5 zones) and it is worth every penny. This. I struggled trying to setup my own system trying to mimic Sonos - mostly because I'm hard headed and like to do things the long and painful way :P After I got over that I bought some sonos speakers and couldn't be happier. Their system is the best, bar none. The ability to place their speakers anywhere within wifi range is super convenient. Yes you can do this with airplay but getting them to mesh is nearly impossible. [doublepost=1474908464][/doublepost] No AirPlay = No purchase. I'm surprised Apple would sell this product in their store without AirPlay support. I hope they're not turning their back on it as it's such a great high quality speaker streaming protocol. Airplay can not match what the Sonos system does. Airplay is for one speaker - Sonos can manage as many speakers as you want to put up. They play under the same wifi protocol IIRC. The only drawback is you can't use iTunes as your player with sonos, you must use the sonos app but once you get used to it you really won't miss iTunes.

Rating: 10 Votes danielwsmithee 14 weeks ago Never really understood the advantage of Sonos over Airplay, and I'm surprised that Apple is supporting a proprietary competing format in their stores. I've got Airplay in 4 rooms of the house. The only feature I wish it had that it doesn't is the ability to play to multiple zones directly from the iOS and not just my Macs (though the Remote App covers that pretty well). A similar Sonos setup would be much more expensive and have a poorer selection of Amps and speakers to play through.

If you have a guest over and want to hear their library, its a pain. I purchased 6 Chromecast audio dongles and can do the same as Sonos but with more versatility and speakers of my choice. Rating: 6 Votes woody74 14 weeks ago Maybe they could pull their finger out and create an Apple Watch app now. Rating: 6 Votes jasonkratz 14 weeks ago As will this http://www.apple.com/us_smb_83039/shop/buy-tv/apple-tv or this http://www.apple.com/us_smb_83039/shop/product/MC414LL/A/airport-express?fnode=58 at a fraction of the cost. I get people like Sonos, I've never understood why. I get people don't like Sonos, I've never understood why. See how that works? I dont get why the guy who posted previously would prefer 6 Chromecast dongles.

Drake’s Views has set a new streaming record. Released in April, the chart-topping set from the Canadian rapper is the first album to reach an unprecedented 1 billion streams on Apple Music. To celebrate the major milestone, Apple presented the 6 God with a huge plaque during the San Jose stop on his “Summer Sixteen Tour” over the weekend. Drizzy accepted the award from Apple CEO Tim Cook, Senior Vice President of Internet Software and Services Eddy Cue, and Apple Music’s head of content, Larry Jackson. “Thank you to everyone,” Drake wrote on Instagram, before providing a close-up of the commemoration piece. B's A photo posted by champagnepapi (@champagnepapi) on Sep 26, 2016 at 12:30am PDT Views was released in April as an Apple Music exclusive. It catapulted to No. 1 for several non-consecutive weeks atop the Billboard 200, earning major figures through hits like “One Dance,” “Hotline Bling,” and “Pop Style,” among others. So far, it’s been certified triple platinum by the RIAA and has reached more than a billion streams on various platforms. The big billion news arrives just as Drake unveils his short film Please Forgive Me on Apple Music, a 23-minute visual directed by Anthony Mandler, featuring Popcaan, Fanny Neguesha, Soni Chidiebere, and Kyla Reid.

As it stands, the Apple Watch has no sort of first-party sleep analysis application and the new Heart Rate app found in watchOS 3 is limited in functionality. Bloomberg says Apple is working on a new Heart Rate app that will be more advanced, measuring person’s fitness by observing the amount of time it takes for a heartbeat to fall from a peak to resting rate. Apple also has plans on expanding its HealthKit functionality. No timeframe has been given. However, watchOS 3.1 is currently in beta for developers but has no notable user-facing features. It’s plausible that Apple will hold back these apps until new hardware is released as the current battery life for the Apple Watch would not work. Currently, the Apple Watch lasts about a day on a full charge and the company recommends you charge your Watch over night. Of course, it could release the apps early and suggest users charge their Apple Watch at a different time but that might be inconvenient for most people. In terms of HealthKit, Apple plans on expanding its platform into a “tool that improves diagnoses” for doctors. Details are scarce, but Apple hopes it can give relevant information to doctors and hospitals regardless of location and system they’re using. When Apple Watch launched in 2014, there were lots of rumors of a blood glucose or blood oxygen sensor in the Watch. We now know that the Apple Watch shipped with ‘just’ a heart rate sensor and accelerometer. In addition, the Apple Watch Series 2 does not add any new health sensors. Bloomberg says we shouldn’t expect that to change. Adding new medical sensors would also likely require approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, a much higher bar for Apple to cross. “If they are going to an FDA device, it would need to have enough battery life to last a day, and something where it independently functions from your phone,” said Yuri Teshler, a health-care consultant at Moor Insights & Strategy. Apple can’t really do anything more with health-related sensors until the watch has a wireless LTE chip and the independent cellular connection that comes with that, he added. Apple has so far struggled to do that. The report counters by saying that things like a glucometer would require approval by the FDA standards bodies. It also says that cellular data is not required as the accelerometer on its own can provide a ton of data on its own.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Tue, Sep 27, 2016 - Page 10　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Apple now ‘boring’ enough to buy VIEW FROM SCANDINAVIA:Nordia Bank’s Robert Naess thinks Apple’s long-term prospects are good, but he is less sanguine about Tesla Motors’ ability to make money Bloomberg Apple Inc losing steam only makes it a bargain. The iPhone maker is cheap and the risk is lower, according to Robert Naess, who oversees 33 billion euros (US$37 billion) in stocks at Nordea Bank, Scandinavia’s largest bank. “Apple is boring now,” he said in an interview at Nordea’s offices in Oslo on Thursday. “Before there was no stability and growth was too high.” Investors have started questioning Apple’s ability to expand after the company ended 13 straight years of uninterrupted sales growth earlier this year. Shares are up 6.8 percent so far this year. For Naess, 52, it is a buying opportunity. He started buying stock in May and now holds about 2 percent in Apple in his funds. “It’s the first time,” he said. “We’ve had the fund since 2005 and never owned Apple.” Naess and his partner Claus Vorm quantitatively analyze thousands of companies to build a portfolio of about 100 “boring” stocks. They are investing in companies with the most stable earnings and avoiding expensive stocks. Global Stable Equity Fund has returned 19 percent on average in the past five years, beating 98 percent of its peers. “Many think it’s a peak, Apple is done and won’t succeed anymore, but we look at the long-term earnings trend,” Naess said. “Our case it that they keep their market share and that things will be OK going forward.” Overall, earnings growth estimates for next year are too high, according to Naess. A year from now, global earnings growth will be as low as zero percent, which will cool the market, he said. While Naess operates strictly by the spreadsheet when it comes to investing, on a personal level his passion is cars, especially Teslas. He and his family have bought so many of the top-end electric cars that Elon Musk’s carmaker at one time banned him from ordering more. With sales now down, he said he is once again allowed to place orders and is about to receive a Tesla Model X in the fall. However, one thing he will not buy is the company’s stock. “Don’t buy Tesla [Motors] because they lose money all the time,” he said. “Economically, Tesla is a terribly bad company.” There is a high risk Tesla will not make any money because it is difficult to go from producing 50,000 cars to more than 500,000 cars, he said. “I think they won’t make it,” Naess said. “I use Tesla as an example of a stock you shouldn’t invest in, even if they make fun and fine cars that I buy.” While his funds have outperformed in the low rate environment in the years after the financial crisis, Naess sees rising rates as a long-term threat to his funds’ returns. “It’s difficult to hide from that risk,” he said. “But the risk for that is low. It could happen but it could take 30 years before it happens.” This story has been viewed 1130 times. Comments will be moderated.

You may find it hard to buy one right now because the iPhone 7 itself is suffering from supply issues and the Jet Black models even more so. One of the reasons for the low supply of Jet Black iPhone 7 units is said to be the difficulty in manufacturing handsets of this color. Apple did explain when the iPhone 7 was unveiled that the Jet Black finish requires a lot of work. The handset is put through a nine-step anodization and polishing process which gives it that luster, but it’s prone to scratching, even Apple suggests you get a case with it. Noted Apple analyst at KGI Securities Ming-Chi Kuo said that the Jet Black iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus models are proving difficult to manufacture. The yield rates of these handsets are claimed to be under 70 percent which means that as many as 30 percent of all units manufactured are failing to meet Apple’s strict quality guidelines. Shipping estimates for this color option quickly slipped to November when pre-orders for the iPhone 7 began on September 9th. This is why it’s hard for customers to get their hands on a Jet Black iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus right now. Kuo also sent out a note to investors recently predicting that even though there has been good demand for the iPhone 7, Apple will ship less iPhone 7 units overall compared to iPhone 6s series shipments last year.

Lifestyle Tech Features Dial review: Six months with will.i.am's 'smart cuff' wrist computer Software updates have made the little 'cuff' into something useable as well as wearable David Phelan Monday 26 September 2016 16:33 BST Click to follow The Independent Tech Some gadgets get better with age. New operating software arrives as if by magic to provide extra features, sort glitches and even sometimes enhance battery life, for instance. The musician will.i.am earlier this year released what he calls a smart cuff. I tried it out when it was in its final stages before release in the Spring. I’m still using it now and it’s transformed out of all recognition. It’s called the dial and it’s proving to be a canny little device, especially if you like music. Unlike most wearable devices, the dial has a sim card inside it, so you don’t need a smartphone alongside it, unlike the Apple Watch, for instance.

Also, though you can read an email on the cuff’s small screen (it measures 1.63 inches), composing a reply is easier on a bigger touchscreen. To be clear, there is a touch-sensitive keyboard on the dial’s screen but it’s pretty small. I have typed several text messages on it and the best approach is to place your finger extremely carefully on the letter you’re after. It’s certainly possible but it’s not comfortable for any length of time. Still, there’s a row of predicted words to choose from which speeds things up and, better, a microphone so you can dictate your message. But the dial is nothing if not versatile. Speaking to it invokes Aneeda, a voice-activated personal assistant. Aneeda speaks with a cut-glass British accent but her dialogue is quite transatlantic. The result is quite appealing, if a little jarring. Request that Aneeda plays music by Adele and she’ll reply, “I be rockin’ them beats”. Ask her to play music and she’ll ask “What kind of stuff you wanna hear?” Read more will.i.am reveals dial - his new smart wrist device Music works tremendously on the dial, not least because when you buy it, it comes with a mobile contract from Three. This is important because the tariff includes a free subscription to the i.am+ music service. Since that costs £9.99 from Spotify or Apple Music, this is not to be sniffed at. What’s more, that data usage of streaming music on the dial is also included in the tariff, as long as you’re streaming it in the UK. Tariffs start at £23 a month, with an upfront cost of £49 for the dial. Note that you can buy the dial on pay-as-you-go but the upfront cost jumps to £359.99. There’s an extensive library of music though as with other services, some black spots. Don’t, whatever you do, ask Aneeda to play Send in the Clowns as the two versions offered, including one by Bryan Ferry, are astonishingly bad. It’s a small point – I can’t see Stephen Sondheim rockin’ them beats on a dial. Music playback through the headphones sounds great and the cans are cleverly designed so that when you take them off they can hang round your neck – a magnet snaps them together. The dial has GPS built in, and it can give you walking, driving and public transport directions easily – the mapping information comes from the excellent Here Maps. I found that I only wanted to use Maps sparingly because GPS canes the battery, as it does on every smartphone. i.am+ knows this because it makes you go into settings to turn the GPS on each time. That’s fine, but I’d have liked to have been able to ask Aneeda to turn it on and off rather than my having to dive into the settings menu. Battery life, by the way, has got better and better. In the early days I found that if I was in a poor signal area, the battery didn’t last long. But in high-signal areas like cities for instance, it lasts almost a full day, even with a decent amount of music streaming. The battery for the dial is cunningly all in the back half of the cuff, so it’s easy to unclip and replace with a spare if you do run low. Obviously it would be better if the battery lasted longer but it’s not bad. One area which really could be improved is the time it takes for the display to activate when you raise your wrist. When you do, the screen stays blank for around two seconds, by which time you presume your wrist twist wasn’t registered and start doing the whole manoeuvre again. As you turn the dial away from you to restart the process, the screen invariably illuminates. Of course, when you’re used to it you know what to expect but compared to rivals like the Apple Watch this is way too slow. And with other watches, like the Samsung Gear S3 having the time displayed constantly, it makes the dial look less inviting. There are other limitations. Although the dial is very good at setting an alarm, it won’t yet set a timer – which is particularly handy if you’re cooking, say and don’t want to get oily fingers on your smartphone. I’m told this feature will follow. The Aneeda voice operating system is pretty slick and even has some capabilities when it comes to follow-up questions. It’s up to date, able to read me news stories when I asked “What’s the latest on Brexit?” The dial also has features rarely found on other gadgets, such as a camera designed for selfies. Smart watches and devices like the dial are becoming more popular. With new models just released or in the offing from Samsung and Apple, the dial needs to find its niche before it can find its feet (or wrist perhaps). I’d say that the classy Bluetooth headphones and the clever music-encompassing tariff from Three may be the ways for the dial to succeed.

One of the apps is said to help Apple Watch users track their sleep patterns in quite a bit of detail which will enable them to analyze their sleep patterns and make any adjustments if need be. Another new app that Apple is reportedly working on for its smartwatch is one that measures fitness levels by measuring the time taken for a user’s heart rate to fall from its peak to the resting level. Apple already has a heart rate measuring app for the Apple Watch but it doesn’t analyze the data. Apple has not commented on this report by Bloomberg so it’s unclear right now when these apps are going to be released. Apple is known for normally not commenting on media reports so it’s unlikely that the company is going to tell us something about these apps ahead of time. Users will certainly be interested in getting more out of their smartwatch so they will be keeping their fingers crossed for these as-yet-unnamed apps for the Apple Watch. Filed in Gadgets.

In the future, if the company gets its way, the software will interpret that information, turning it into advice for users, doctors and others. Scores of health-care experts hired by Apple in recent years are building improved electronic health record software that can better analyse and understand the implications of patient data, according to people familiar with the team’s plans. The iPhone maker is also working on new apps for the Apple Watch. One helps users track sleep patterns, one of the people said. Another app gauges fitness levels by measuring the time taken for the heart rate to fall from its peak to resting level, according to one of the other people. Apple already has an app that measures heart rate, but doesn’t interpret that data. The ultimate goal of Apple’s medical technology team is to turn HealthKit into a tool that improves diagnoses, the people said. The system could chip away at two problems that plague the industry and have stumped other specialist firms in the field: interoperability — allowing data to be transferred from hospital to hospital across different databases; and analysis — making it quick and easy for physicians to extrapolate salient information from mountains of data. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook wants Apple to do more in software and services to secure new sources of revenue and make customers more dependent on the company’s devices. The US$8 trillion (RM32 trillion) global health-care industry is a big opportunity. “If you drive for a while and your car gets too hot, it says pull over. If you need an oil change, it says check your oil. What’s the equivalent for the body?” Cook said at a May conference in Amsterdam. “Health is a huge issue around the world and we think it’s ripe for simplicity and a new view.” An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. Glimpse of future Earlier this year, Apple bought Gliimpse Inc, a startup that built software to pull electronic health records from different databases and in different formats, then store them in one place. “I will be working on building a platform, a set of application program interfaces, and a simple product that will bring what we believe will be a disruptive consumer health-care application to the US for the first time,” Apple Health senior engineer Mohan Randhava wrote on his LinkedIn profile, which states he was employed at Gliimpse until February. He likened the product to Apple’s music business. That started with the iPod, but as people became accustomed to storing all their music files digitally, Apple built a lucrative music platform on top of the device. Apple health software could become a revenue driver, too, by keeping people wedded to the company’s devices. If a patient’s health records, and related suggestions, are accessible through Apple’s system, it would be harder to trade in an iPhone for a smartphone running Google’s Android operating system, and its health-tracking software Google Fit. The second version of Apple’s Watch has a faster processor, a built-in GPS tracker and is water resistant so people can run, swim and do other exercise with the device. The updated Watch software, dubbed watchOS 3, places health tracking information more prominently in the user interface, and adds a breathing exercise app as well as swim tracking. Building more sensors into the Watch serves a limited purpose. An accelerometer can generate most of the useful data needed to monitor a person’s well-being, according to one person with knowledge of Apple’s plans. A glucometer or blood-pressure sensor would only help a small percentage of users, the person said. Adding new medical sensors would also likely require approval from the US Food and Drug Administration, a much higher bar for Apple to cross. “If they are going to an FDA device, it would need to have enough battery life to last a day, and something where it independently functions from your phone,” said Yuri Teshler, a health-care consultant at Moor Insights & Strategy. Apple can’t really do anything more with health-related sensors until the watch has a wireless LTE chip and the independent cellular connection that comes with that, he added. Apple has so far struggled to do that. Embedding It’s unclear how soon improvements to Apple’s HealthKit may be introduced. ResearchKit, another Apple software, lets research institutions and drugmakers conduct clinical trials using iPhone apps, and some of the trials hint at possible future applications for HealthKit. Each clinical study using ResearchKit brings Apple a step closer to embedding itself in hospitals, labs and doctors’ surgeries. North Carolina’s Duke University developed a ResearchKit app using the iPhone’s front-facing camera to conduct facial recognition checks which try to screen for and diagnose autism. Johns Hopkins University is using the Apple Watch’s accelerometer and heart-rate sensor to track the onset and duration of seizures and try to predict them. In July, GlaxoSmithKline Plc became the first drug maker to start a ResearchKit clinical study. “Apple is working hard with many of these large institutions to generate tools that are medically correct, to take data from sensors,” said Scott Jenkins, CEO of health data management company Certainty Health LLC. “They want to be the repository, the open collection space.” Stephen Friend, a Merck & Co veteran who founded health data non-profit Sage Bionetworks, is credited with being the brains behind ResearchKit. He joined Apple full-time in June having worked as a consultant for more than two years. Flipboard co-founder Evan Doll rejoined Apple in July as a director of health software engineering. Yoky Matsuoka, formerly technology chief at Google’s Nest Labs unit, also joined Apple’s health team last year. Nest is known mostly as a hardware specialist, but Matsuoka led the development of software that interpreted and learned from data that its internet-connected thermostats collect. She’s using that machine-learning experience as she oversees a health-data team at Apple. Apple’s greatest hurdle for now is proving to medical professionals that data delivered from wearables through HealthKit and ResearchKit is reliable. Brennan Spiegel, a gastroenterologist at Los Angeles’ Cedars-Sinai Hospital, said clinical studies are crucial to making wearables useful. “It’s wonderful to have advanced methods of aggregating and presenting data, but there’s a risk of it becoming a garbage-in, garbage-out project,” Spiegel said. “It doesn’t matter how sophisticated the technical solution is. What matters is whether the data going into that solution are generating clinically valuable, actionable results that’s improving human health in a way that’s cost-effective.” — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Dog fight: Start-ups take aim at errant drones Streaming subscription boom boosts US music sales Steam reveals top-selling PC games of 2016: ‘No Man’s Sky,’ ‘Stardew Valley’ join ‘GTA V’ Samsung’s new Galaxy A is here Samsung Galaxy Note 7: The high-tech fiasco draws to a close Samsung Galaxy Note 7: the high-tech fiasco draws to a close ‘Virtually Real,’ the world’s first 3D-printed VR art exhibition in London End of the road for CyanogenMod, an alternative smartphone operating system How China built ‘iPhone City’ with billions in perks for Apple’s partner India launches biometric payment system Most Watched Now Week MMOTV: SKYACTIV Technologies — reason for renewed Mazda popularity Reuters Video: Israel's Netanyahu dismisses media reports of gifts investigation Reuters Video: Around 60 killed in Brazil prison riot HD video of earth from space will make your heart ache Reuters Video: Carrie Fisher, Debbie Reynolds remembered in LA Reuters Video: Nunes stuns challenger Rousey with first-round title win Related Articles Discounts, advertising spur brisk Apple Watch sales Apple Watch sales to consumers set record in holiday week, says Tim Cook Toms launches Apple Watch wrist bands How accurate are fitness trackers when it comes to heart rate readings?

Sep 26, 2016 Share Tweet 0 Drake's Views just scored its latest achievement by becoming the first album on Apple Music to achieve over one billion streams on the service. "🍏🍎 Thank you to everyone. OVO Sound to the 🌎 @applemusic," Drake captioned the post alongside Apple CEO, Tim Cook, who presented him with the plaque that he also signed with his name, thanking the rapper for his historic achievement and likely for driving such traffic to Apple Music. Drake has been with Apple Music since it first launched back in 2015 and even took the stage at Apple's Worldwide Developers meeting to talk to the audience about the service. He also signed a deal with the company which was rumored to be worth $19 million and it included the launch of OVO Sound Radio. Of course, Views arrived in April as an Apple Music and iTunes exclusive, so it makes sense that it achieved such monumental success on the service. The album was also certified triple platinum by the RIAA in August and earned over a billion total streams across all platforms back in June. It's a good time to be Drake who also dropped his Views-inspired short film, Please Forgive Me, exclusively on Apple Music. The visual was directed by the same talent behind some of those very big Apple Music ads and stars Drizzy alongside familiar faces like Popcaan and Kyla Reid, who is best known for having her song sampled by Drake on "One Dance." For the visual, Drake reunited with his "Hotline Bling" video choreographer, Tanisha Scott.   B's A photo posted by champagnepapi (@champagnepapi) on Sep 26, 2016 at 12:30am PDT <script async defer src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"></script> Tags: News, Drake, Tim Cook, Views From the 6, apple-music, Complex Video  Like  Follow  Chat Show Comments 0 Lateststories Are Chance the Rapper and Childish Gambino Working on New Music?

Lifestyle Tech Features macOS Sierra review: Apple's new computer operating system brings small, stable, stunning tweaks Everything is just a little closer together David Phelan Monday 26 September 2016 16:23 BST Click to follow The Independent Tech A MacBook Pro. Macs are very pernickety about the software they allow you to install Getty Images Earlier this week, Apple released its latest software for its computers. This latest version of macOS is called Sierra, continuing the natural landmark theme of previous editions Yosemite and El Capitan. I’ve been using the public beta version since June and watched it become more accomplished, stable and reliable. There are lots of new features in Sierra, and the good news is that downloading and installing the update is pretty quick. And the stability of the program means you it installs painlessly, too. As in previous years, this update brings Apple’s mobile and Mac software (iOS and macOS) even more closely integrated. So Siri, the voice-activated assistant has finally arrived on the computer. Windows, to be fair, had put Cortana into its PC operating software, and now Apple has the same simple way of interacting with your computer. The 10 biggest changes in iOS 10 10 show all The 10 biggest changes in iOS 10 1/10 New lock screen This might be the first thing you notice, and it’s probably the most significant change to your daily routine. The old slide-to-unlock lock screen is gone; in its place is one you press the home button to unlock. You can try that out in practice just by locking your phone and waking it up. All you really need to know is that you press the home button to do everything, but if you’d like to find out more you can read our full write-up 2/10 Huge changes to Messages You can try these out straight away, though not all of them will work with people who haven’t yet upgraded to iOS 10 themselves. The first things to have a go with are Apple’s own improvements to the app. You can find those by clicking the little arrow that’s appeared next to the field where you write messages – which will bring up options for sending drawings, heartbeats or pictures. But by far the biggest change is the introduction of apps to Messages. You get on that by clicking the little icon that looks like the App Store – in there, you’ll find a host of different apps including ones for finding gifs and others for sending people money 3/10 Useful notifications Notifications have got much more rich (and also much bigger). Now, when they pop up on your lock screen you can hard or long press to interact with them, and if apps are properly made for iOS 10 then you’ll even be able to see a mini version of them as you do. The best app to try this out with at the moment is the Messages app, when someone sends you a text. But integration should be coming to most apps soon, when you’ll get a proper chance to try them all out 4/10 Useful 3D Touch And that same theme runs into the home screen, when you’re on it. If you hard press on an app icon with 3D Touch, you’ll get a mini version of it that you can interact with. That means that you can see who you’ve got emails from, for instance, or click to on Music to start some of your recently played albums. Each of those things can be added as a widget to the lock screen, making them even quicker to view 5/10 Apple Maps redesign Apple’s controversial but hugely improved mapping has received perhaps the biggest renovation in iOS 10. The design is very different, and as are the features that are included. It now gives you the opportunity to have your routes change as you move along, and to zoom in and out while you’r eon your journey. And it’ll let you schedule stop-offs, finding coffee or petrol while you’re on your journey. But the biggest change is just how you find where you’re going. Using the search bar at the bottom will bring up a range of suggestions – including things pulled out of your mail and other apps, which the phone thinks that you’re likely to be heading to 6/10 Apple Music redesign When Apple Music came out last year, it was interesting and exciting but also a little confusing. Thankfully that’s been scrapped this year – and in its place comes a far easier to use design. Gone are the different confusing sections like "New" and "Connect", with their features being folded into other parts of the app. In its place is an app that is like the rest of iOS 10 – slightly less packed with information, but with that information far more organised 7/10 Deleting apps There’s never been a finally more heartfelt and true than this one: You can finally delete the stock apps that you don’t use from your home screen. So, for example, you can get rid of the Stocks app that you never use to check how the markets are doing; you can get rid of the Tips app that you never use to see how to use your phone. It’s done as you’d expect to delete it. Just tap and hold on the relevant app and click the cross in the corner. Some of the apps aren’t actually deleted, but all of them can be recovered through the App Store all the same. Just search for the app that you want to get back and it’ll look like you’re downloading it, but actually it’ll just appear back on your phone 8/10 Changes to Photos Photos has become far more clever, using artificial intelligence to search out the things you want to find. So now, for example, you can search for Tree and see all the trees you’ve photographed; you can tell it who people are and have it find pictures of them; and it’ll arrange special automatic memories of nice days out you’ve had. You can try all those by heading into the Photos app. Initially it might be less full than you’d expect, because the calculations have to be done on your phone; they’ll be done overnight on the first day you plug it in 9/10 Cleverer Siri Apple is finally letting other apps have Siri talk to them, and them talk back. So you can ask for a ride to somewhere, for instance, and Siri will be able to ask Uber for a car; or you can ask to send someone money and it’ll sort that out for you. Apps are just being updated to make this work correctly, but you should be able to try it out in apps like Uber from the beginning 10/10 Better keyboard This might not be the kind of thing that you’d want to try out straight away. But it’s the sort of thing that will gradually improve your life, quietly and slowly – which is actually a great representative for how iOS 10 feels. The new keyboard can read your messages, so that it knows what people are asking. And it can then raid information to give up what people are asking for, quickly. So, for instance, if someone asks for your email, it’ll just pop up in the suggestions box. No typing for you – you’ll be able to send it straight away Siri works extremely well on the Mac, though I do miss the hands-free “Hey Siri” command that makes the iPhone or iPad respond even when you’re too far away to touch your phone or tablet. On the Mac you can send Messages, dictate emails and perform Spotlight searches with ease. I’ve noted before that Siri is great at recognising most words but not ideal for names. Still, that’s the case with most voice-control systems, or maybe it’s just my friends have weird names. You can save Spotlight searches by clicking on a Plus button and it’ll appear in your notifications bar on the right edge of the display. It updates, too, so if you ask what time it is in Peru, the bar will show the current time continuously. Then there’s iCloud Drive, which now lets you store all the files from your Desktop and Documents folders in iCloud, downloading them as you need them, or keeping them to hand on your hard drive as well. This is very handy, though be warned that when you set this up, it’s momentarily panicking as the contents are moved from where you left them into the Documents and Desktop sections of iCloud. They are still there, it’s just a slightly different way to access them. Read more iPhone 7 headphone jack removal could spread to other Apple products Once you’re used to it, iCloud Drive for Desktop and Documents is very handy as you can access documents from other Macs you use, or from icloud.com. And it certainly makes for a tidier desktop than I formerly had. Note that when you first start backing stuff up to iCloud it can slow your Mac down until the backup is finished. Apple Watch users can now unlock their Mac via their timepiece. You need the latest software on the Watch as well as the computer and it’s the more recent Macs that can do this. Setting it up isn’t quite as simple as it might be but when it’s up and running it’s a real treat. No more typing in a password to unlock your screen (except when you power up the computer), you tap the mouse or keyboard and the screen unlocks. It feels intimate and personal. Then there’s Universal Clipboard. The first time you use it, it’s almost unnerving, it’s so good. Choose a photo on your iPhone and click the Share button. Choose copy from the menu that appears. Put the phone down and in the Word document open on your Mac screen, say, press paste. The photo appears. It’s done so well that it beguiles you with its simplicity. Of course, you can paste more than photos – that painstakingly crafted paragraph on your Mac appears in the email on your iPad in a second, for instance. It’s so simple it’s astonishing it hasn’t appeared before and it’s the kind of feature that becomes increasingly useful – “Oh, wait a minute, I can just paste it…” There are plenty more features, some big, some so discreet you’ll catch yourself arching an eyebrow as you spot something’s changed. Like the way that tabs are no longer restricted to Safari – if in Maps you have several pages open, they’ll sit together with tabs at the top. This also works in Mail, Pages, Keynote and more. If you like to watch video while you work, you multi-tasker, you, then you’ll be glad of a floating video window that can sit on the desktop while you do other stuff. And there are more of the features which have just launched on the iPhone. Like Photos which creates collections of photos of a party or holiday into one place making them easier to access. The facial recognition from earlier versions is incorporated here, too, so you can see who was there. And the Search feature that’s tremendously good on the iPhone is here, too, so if you type “dog” it’ll locate all the four-legged friends pics, even though you haven’t categorised them or anything. Best features of iOS 10 Other features are subtle tweaks. If you didn’t like the idea in Messages that everyone knows when you’ve read their incoming text, you can turn “read receipts” off. Now you can have it on or off by each individual conversation. There are scores of changes of this little magnitude, most of them entirely pleasing. The now-annual updates Mac users enjoy mix small and huge changes easily. This year, I’d say the real ground-breaker is iCloud Drive’s extra features – it’s certainly the one I’ve encountered most, Siri notwithstanding. Siri is great, but won’t suit every situation (please don’t use it on the train, for instance). Together, these are certainly strong advances in a still-familiar world, designed to enhance how you use your Mac in such small ways you may hardly notice at times. But try taking these advances away and, oh boy, then you’ll see how much difference they make.

But in an interview, the CEO of one of Apple's biggest manufacturing partners has defended the iPhone 7, and predicted it will be a sales hit. Pegatron chairperson Tung Tzu-hsien spoke to Nikkei Asian Review about the launch of the iPhone 7, saying he remains "cautiously optimistic" while declining to discuss actual numbers. DON'T MISS: iPhone 7 review Tung's cautious optimism flies in the face of most other analysts, who are predicting lower sales for this year than for the iPhone 6s. Most of that is down to a perceived lack of innovation -- Apple kept the same chassis design and screen for the iPhone 7, so consumers can't be bothered to upgrade. Or at least, that's how one line of thinking goes. "Consumers do not care about what analysts say about the lack of innovative features," Tung said. That's anecdotally backed up by the fact that iPhones are sold out all over the globe, reviews have mostly been positive, and networks have seen record sales figures. But outside of the US, most numbers paint a different picture. Apple's stock fell by over 1 percent on Friday, when German market research firm GfK predicted a 25% drop in iPhone 7 sales outside the U.S. Tung also did not thing the Samsung Note 7 explodepocalypse would help iPhone sales figures. "The Note series only takes up a small portion of Samsung's total shipments. Our U.S. client's new handsets are competing against Samsung's S7 series rather than the Note 7," Tung told Nikkei.  With Apple refusing to release sales figures this year, we will probably have to wait until the next set of financial earnings to know how well the iPhone sold. In the US, it seems like business as usual. But Apple is much more than just a seller of iPhones to well-heeled high schoolers, and the global picture may turn out to be less rosy.

If you are in the Android camp, enjoy. There are Apple fans and then there are Apple douches. If you know anyone in the latter category, here is a way to end the doucheness for good. A prank video that says you can drill a hole in the new iPhone 7 for the 3.5 mm jack of your headphones has gone viral and reportedly claimed several victims already. Apple’s announcement that they were doing away with the 3.5mm jack in favour of wireless headsets had gotten a mixed response. People who wanted to use their favourite headphones via the universal jack were quite bummed that Apple had left them in the lurch. And by the comments to the YouTube video, it seems the technologically-challenged among them thought all Apple did was cover the hole with a bit of plastic. Nothing that a power drill can get through, right? The fact that this is a video by the same guy who microwaves iPhones for fun does not seem to have deterred them. Warning: If you are an Apple fan, the video contains footage of a graphic nature.

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Microsoft is bringing callkit integration to Skype for Business on iOS10 0 by Michael Allison  @Mkeallison Sep 26, 2016 at 16:00 GMT3 months ago Microsoft is adept at supporting Apple’s newest iOS updates with its services, and iOS10 is n exception. At Ignite today, Microsoft demoed upcoming support for Apple’s CallKit framework for its Skype for Business app. To bring some background to this, CallKit is a new framework introduced in iOS 10 that allows VoIP apps to display full-screen notifications – like Microsoft’s Windows 10 Mobile and Google’s Android do already – and integrate into the system dialer UI for easier access for users as opposed to showing up like a banner notification. By integrating with CallKit, VoIP apps like Skype and Skype for Business become more reliable as primary communication networks while on the go, an invaluable advantage for business users. iOS users can expect the new Skype for Business update to hit the iTunes store soon.

Happy New Year firework wallpapers The top stories of the week on iDB How to use AirPods like a pro   skip to main content skip to main menu     Bloomberg: Apple Watch to gain new sleep tracking and fitness apps & more By Christian Zibreg, Sep 26, 2016 Tweet 2 Comments In an effort to advance its HealthKit framework, Apple has reportedly been developing a pair of new apps for the Apple Watch. One will help users track and analyze their sleep and the other will their track fitness levels by measuring the time taken for the heart rate to fall from its peak to resting level, Bloomberg reports. The company has hired “scores of healthcare experts” to develop improved electronic health record software and help turn the Apple Watch into a tool that diagnoses disease. “The ultimate goal of Apple’s medical technology team is to turn HealthKit into a tool that improves diagnoses,” sources said. Bloomberg’s Alex Webb writes: The system could chip away at two problems that plague the industry and have stumped other specialist firms in the field: interoperability—allowing data to be transferred from hospital to hospital across different databases; and analysis—making it quick and easy for physicians to extrapolate salient information from mountains of data. Turning the Apple Watch into a diagnostic tool of sorts may not necessarily require new sensors. According to a source, an accelerometer inside an Apple Watch can already generate most of the useful data needed to monitor a person’s well-being. A dedicated glucometer or blood-pressure sensor would only help “a small percentage of users”. Tim Cook is adamant that Apple can help advance healthcare. “If you drive for a while and your car gets too hot, it says pull over. If you need an oil change, it says check your oil. What’s the equivalent for the body?” he said at a May conference in Amsterdam. “Health is a huge issue around the world and we think it’s ripe for simplicity and a new view.” watchOS 3 has brought out the ability to track swimming along with a new Breathe app that helps users relax a bit by taking deep-breathing exercises. Both watchOS 3 and the Health app in iOS 10 feature support for wheelchair users, too. iOS 10’s Health app has also gained the ability to register as an organ, tissue or eye donor, support for a couple of new data types and the ability to store encrypted health records stored in the Health Level 7 Continuity of Care Document (HL7 CCD) format. The latter feature permits doctors to receive patients’ data from the Health app in an appropriate format to easily track years of their health data. Your doctor can also optionally share your HL7 CCD records from the Health app with other doctors. However, were Apple to turn the Apple Watch into a tool that can diagnose disease, it would first need to obtain an FDA approval. “If they are going to an FDA device, it would need to have enough battery life to last a day, and something where it independently functions from your phone,” according to a health-care consultant cited in the article. An FDA approval would also require the wearable device to include an embedded cellular chip so it could work standalone.

His comment targets a recent analyst report from KGI Securities’ Ming-Chi Kuo predicting fewer iPhone 7 sales in 2016 than the iPhone 6s garnered in 2015. Analyst firm Piper Jaffray, too, downplayed Kuo’s negative report in an interview with AppleInsider, saying it’s seeing similarities to the monster iPhone 6 upgrade cycle. Pegatron CEO and Chairman Tung Tzu-hsien put it succinctly, saying that “consumers do not care about what analysts say about the lack of innovative features”. He is “cautiously optimistic” about iPhone 7 sales and expressed doubt that the recent Samsung Galaxy Note 7 recall will boost Apple’s sales figures because, as he put it, the iPhone 7 is selling on the strength of the phone itself. Data based on stock checks of 134 Apple retail stores 9 days after iPhone 7 launch. His take on the Note 7 fires not effecting iPhone 7 sales significantly (emphasis mine): The Note series only takes up a small portion of Samsung’s total shipments. Our U.S. client’s new handsets (Apple iPhone 7) are competing against Samsung’s Galaxy S7 series rather than the Note 7. AppleInsider on the latest Piper Jaffray estimate: Regarding negative interpretations of Apple sales data by third parties, such as information put forth by KGI Securities on Sunday, Piper Jaffray believes that the data is impacted by “essentially zero” iPhone 7 Plus models available for weekend sale, with no similar constraints for the launch of the iPhone 6S. As these reports are not in line with “positive commentary and Apple’s own commentary about stock outs”, Piper Jaffray is sticking with previous estimates of an iPhone 7 sales cycle similar to that of the monster iPhone 6 upgrade, and not the iPhone 6s. Here’s Bill Maher explaining why you don’t need to buy an iPhone 7. Analysts in Taipei have estimated that Apple will ship a total of 201-204 million handsets for 2016, down from some 230 million in 2015, due to “weaker demand for the iPhone 7 compared to earlier models.” Older reports claimed Apple had set a goal of having its manufacturing partners make nearly 100 million iPhone 7/Plus devices by the end of this year versus suppliers’ earlier prediction of 80-85 million units. According to the latest supply chain report by DigiTimes, Apple has requested its manufacturing partners to stock chips for a combined 50 million iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus units in the third quarter of 2016, and another 45 million units in the fourth quarter. An estimate from analog chip suppliers claims that iPhone 7 chip volume for the first quarter of 2017 will likely fall about 20 percent sequentially to 35-37 million units to account for iPhone seasonality. Shares of Apple fell 1.67 percent on Friday after German market research firm GfK estimated a 25 percent drop in international iPhone 7 sales when compared year-on-year to iPhone 6s sales.

(AP Photo/Richard Voge) Share Written by Mike Murphy September 26, 2016 The cheapest iPhone 7 retails for $649, but new research suggests it costs Apple roughly $225 to build one. Market research firm IHS Markit recently took apart the iPhone 7 to price out all of the individual parts that go into building the phone. According to its analysts’ research, those parts likely cost Apple about $220 to purchase, and about $5 to assemble. That means Apple’s newest phone only costs about a third of its price-tag, to make. That’s actually far more expensive than the last iPhone model. Even though the iPhone 7 looks a lot like its predecessor the 6S, it has a few costly technological enhancements on the inside. The new phone has a brighter, deeper display, a new haptic engine that provides a range of buzzes and taps when you get notifications, and its storage was upgraded from 16 GB to 32 GB. (Apple wasn’t immediately available to confirm IHS Markit’s cost estimates.) While Apple has spent more producing some phones in the past—the iPhone 6S Plus is currently the most expensive phone it’s ever built, at least until IHS takes apart the iPhone 7 Plus—the iPhone 7 is actually the most expensive flagship phone the company has produced, costing slightly more than even the original iPhone from 2007, at a time when the average smartphones were giant things with buttons and antennae. Although parts and labor aren’t the only costs that go into the total cost of making a product like the iPhone—there’s research and development, marketing, shipping, and packaging, to name a few—it’s surprising that Apple has spent relatively so much on a phone that many have found underwhelming, and at a time when the company’s sales are stalling. It’ll be interesting to see whether next year’s iPhone, rumored to be a complete overhaul, will be accompanied by a similar bump in cost.

The company will offer "Spoken Editions" of online content, a series of podcasts offering an audio version of a publisher's written material. The idea could appeal to people who do regular exercise and don't have time to catch up on the news each day. iTunes will be able to get you up to speed as you run, using text-to-speech technology to convert written news articles into audio podcasts. TechCrunch reports that Apple has already convinced several major publishers to give the idea a try. Names including Forbes, TIME, WIRED and TechCrunch itself will be amongst the first to release Spoken Editions of their content. The emphasis is on short-form material that quickly provides the listener with the article's key points. This will help to prevent people abandoning the feature after being deterred by long and monotonous podcasts. Apple is working with existing podcasting networks and publishers to prepare iTunes for Spoken Editions. One company, SpokenLayer, is already offering technology to media companies to create podcasts from their written work. SpokenLayer provides audio creation and distribution services, simplifying the conversion from online article to audio recording. SpokenLayer's network includes a unique "voice" for each publisher. Its proprietary tech is able to convert audio content into a signature for each brand, ensuring every site has its own "personality." This enables listeners to identify each company and prevents iTunes becoming filled with podcasts narrated by the same text-to-speech engine. "We make sure Wired sounds like Wired and any other publication sounds like those publications," SpokenLayer CEO Will Mayo told TechCrunch. "The voice and style of any brand is in its writers and the reporting it does. That's unique for every publication, and that uniqueness is honored." Mayo did not comment on SpokenLayer's participation in Spoken Editions. Apple hasn't officially announced Spoken Editions yet. The feature was spotted earlier today after making an appearance on iTunes itself. Apple has already withdrawn the relevant listings. Spoken Editions appears to be a rival to emerging short-form audio products such as Amazon's recently-launched Audible Channels. Podcasts are a rapidly growing content segment, seeing 30 percent annual usage increases. Apple will use Spoken Editions to capitalise on this trend. Publishers can monetise their content with audio ads to take advantage too, reaching millions of iTunes users in the process. Spoken Editions also marks Apple's growing interest in news and the media. The company recently overhauled its Apple News service with iOS 10, creating a more complete app that allows users to aggregate multiple news sources into one place. Spoken Editions will do the same but for spoken content. Apple is said to be planning to launch the service in October.

This year, Apple switched it up and ditched the all gold models in favor of ceramic. Why ceramic you might ask? Well first off, it’s a heck of a lot cheaper than solid gold, but it’s also four times stronger than stainless steel, which makes it the most scratch resistant Apple Watch available… Inside of the box, you’ll find the Series 2 Apple Watch Edition of course in a standard hard shell white container, with some paperwork and documentation below it. Below that, you’ll find Apple’s Magnetic Charging dock, which is a nice added bonus here. It retails separately for $80. Along with that there’s a Lightning cable for the dock and Apple’s standard Apple Watch charging puck. So as you can see, there are not many thrills this year when compared to the previous Edition models. It’s more like the stainless steel Apple Watch experience with the added dock and some special documentation. Apple even went as far as shipping it with just a standard Sport band, but at least the pin is also ceramic here. When it comes to looks, I’m a big fan of the glossy white. Oddly enough, it’s the polar opposite of Apple’s Jet Black iPhone. Here we have the least scratchable Apple product and the most scratchable Apple product… all released in 2016. Check out our unboxing and review video below: Obviously this slick Ceramic white isn’t for everyone, but it’ll look good with just about any band that’s not metallic. It’s white so it’ll go with anything, but that all depends on how flashy you want to be. My favorite combo is definitely the Leather Loop; the white and black piano look is just excellent. The digital crown has a black cap on the end for some awesome contrast and the entire Apple Watch feels slightly heavier than the already hefty stainless steel model. Side by side with the Space Black Apple Watch, it’s hard to say that one is necessarily better than the other. They both rock watchOS 3 and have the same features and water resistance rating as its a Series 2. In fact, there’s not much that makes this Apple Watch worth its cost aside from the pure lust for ceramic and the bragging rights of owning a watch style that will likely be discontinued in a year or two as we saw with the original Apple Watch Edition. Don’t get me wrong though, Apple Watch is definitely one of the best smartwatches out there and this model is especially brilliant in terms of its beauty. I definitely can’t recommend buying it over standard Apple Watches for obvious reasons. I mean it starts at $1249. It’s totally awesome and quite rugged, but you can get the same functionality for much less if you don’t care for the ceramic look. The good news is that it’s not nearly as expensive as Apple’s original Edition which ranged $10,000 to $17,000, but still a lot to stomach for a smartwatch that’ll be updated eventually.

When Apple originally announced the use of differential privacy in iOS 10, it was not without a little controversy. Skeptics from all corners began wondering how private differential privacy could really be when used in a mass deployment in the way that iOS 10 was going to use it. Apple clarified that the use of differential privacy to collect user data would be opt-in, meaning if a user didn’t want to give into the system they didn’t have to. What Apple never indicated was where this opt-in area would be and what would happen if you decided against it… When iOS 10 was officially released to the public a few weeks back, I decided to start from scratch versus restoring from a backup. Not because of any lingering idea that something from past iOS backups would interfere with iOS 10, but just to see what a new user on iOS 10 would see. The one thing I was critically looking for was the indication of where I could opt-in to Apple’s use of differential privacy, and that’s where it all got hazy. Being an amateur iOS developer, I’ve grown accustomed to configuring devices and always opting-in to sharing diagnostic and usage information. I understand the importance of receiving crash reports from users so that a developer can work quickly to resolve issues. What I neglected to do was find where the instated differential privacy options with iOS 10 came in. The situation was made even more evident to me by Aleksandra Korolova, an assistant professor working on privacy at the University of Southern California’s Viterbi School of Engineering. 2/ Opt-in text for differentially private data collection missing info needed for meaningful choice: privacy parameter values used by iOS 10 — Aleksandra Korolova (@korolova) September 13, 2016 Korolova and her student Jun Tang discovered that Apple had lumped in the mention of differential privacy under two different diagnostic sections in iOS 10. With iOS 10, opting in to having diagnostic and usage data sent automatically to app developers means that users are also automatically subjected to data collection using differential privacy. It seems that if a user wants to submit diagnostic data to developers, but not be subject to the collection of this new data, they’re out of luck. This is where we have to separate the conversation a bit. App developers won’t be receiving your differentially private data when being sent diagnostics and usage data. The data being collected is for and by Apple at this time. Apple had stated in the past that the use of differential privacy is a way to build “crowdsourced learning while keeping that data of the individual users completely private”. Apple then went on to state that the use of differential privacy would be limited to four specific use cases: New words that users add to their local dictionaries, emojis typed by the user (so that Apple can suggest emoji replacements), deep links used inside apps (provided they are marked for public indexing) and lookup hints within notes. 3/ Diagnostics so far: algorithms CountMedianSketch, OneBitHistogram, SequenceFragmentPuzzle+CountMedianSketch; epsilon 1, 1, 4 (ht JunTang) — Aleksandra Korolova (@korolova) September 13, 2016 Of course, data collection isn’t new on iOS. Users could submit their diagnostics and usage information on iOS 9 and older if they chose to opt-in. According to iOS 10’s Diagnostics and Privacy terms, “none of the collected information identifies you personally”. The personal data collected (the four specific use cases listed above) “is either not logged at all” or is “subject to privacy preserving techniques such as differential privacy”. The question then comes down to: how private is this use of data? I enjoy the idea of Apple suggesting me emoji replacements, but not at the expense of risking to expose my data in how I currently use my device to do so. Will you opt-out of having further data collected if it means app developers won’t be getting your crash reports? Take Our Poll Differential privacy is supposed to create a safeguard by taking my data and making it private, but how can I be sure? It appears that Apple uses various algorithms to anonymize the data (see Korolova’s tweets with images of diagnostic logs above), but there is no clarity in how private that data is. For a user to make a better choice on whether or not they choose to allow collection of their data with differential privacy, they would need to be better informed on how private their data remains after any of the particular algorithms are applied. To opt-out of sending developers your diagnostics and usage data automatically on iOS 10, and thus no longer having data collected: Step 1. Launch Settings > Privacy > Diagnostics & Usage Step 2. Select Don’t Send. (You may also be notified ‘This will also turn off data collection on your Apple Watch.”) We’ve reached out to Apple requesting further clarification, and will update the post if we receive a response.  Apple’s response has been added to the top of the post.

So why is Apple making you wait for weeks? The answer, apparently, comes down to quality control. See also: iOS 10 hidden secrets -- Cool new features you don't want to miss According to a note sent out to clients by KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the failure rate for the jet black finish cases is high, with yields down the in the 60 to 70 percent region. This means that a lot of cases are being rejected because they don't meet Apple's exacting standards. Another factor is high demand, with a KGI pre-order survey suggesting that the jet black finish was the most popular, accounting for about a third of all sales worldwide, and almost half of all sales in China. "The survey offers an insight into iPhone buyers' tendency to choose models that are aesthetically different from the 6S. Popularity of the jet black version indicates that consumers prefer an alternative to the traditional metal finish," wrote Kuo. KGI Securities has increased its sales estimate for the iPhone 7 from 65 million to between 70 million and 75 million, which is an improvement over what analysts have been previously predicting, but still lower that sales of the iPhone 6s saw last year. The jet black finish is also prone to scratching, which could also mean that Apple will find itself having to replace handsets that are prematurely showing signs of wear. In fact, the finish is so delicate that Apple is suggesting that owners put their jet black iPhone 7 handsets into cases to protect them from scuffing. Cool, new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus acc...

The process works by introducing an extra step after an account holder has typed their username and password into a device they have not used before. 7 There a number of simple ways iPhone users can protect their private photos and data They are also required to enter a code that is either texted to a trusted mobile phone number or sent via Apple's Find My iPhone app. If the person does not enter the code, they are refused access to iCloud and are blocked from making an iTunes, iBooks, or App Store purchase. HOW TO PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL DATA ON iCLOUD Choose a password with a combination of letters and numbers to make it harder for hackers to access information. Also make sure you use the two-step verification, which combines your password with a pin number either sent to your phone in a text, or created by an app on your phone. Add a second “rescue” email to your account, so if a hacker does take over your primary email, you can regain control over your Apple ID and iCloud account. Stop pictures automatically uploading to iCloud by turning off Photo Stream via Settings menu. When deleting a picture, check all your phones and tablets synced with your iCloud, as snaps may also appear in their photo stream. Keeping your iPhone up to date can help protect it too as hackers will find it more difficult to find flaws in Apple's coding in newer iOS updates. Auto-wipe iPhone content by selecting 'Erase Data' in settings. The feature will automatically wipe all content after ten incorrect password guesses but we wouldn't recommend this if you're not always great at getting the information right!

Jane Bradley Email 14:08 16:17 Monday 26 September 2016 0 Have your say Alexander McQueen, who drew on his Scots heritage for many of his collections, is the only fashion designer to appear in the top twenty of this year's British "Cool Brands" list. Tech brand Apple has topped the iconic list for the fifth year running, followed by Glastonbury and Netflix. McQueen was ranked 13th, while Aston Martin and Nike made up the remainder of the top five. The designer, who was born in England, but often turned to his Scottish roots for inspiration, was found dead at his London home in 2010. His ashes were scattered at Kilmuir on the Isle of Skye. Other new entries into the Top 20 included make up brand M.A.C and Harley Davidson and PlayStation, both of which re-entered the Top 20 after a five year absence. Stephen Cheliotis, chairman of the CoolBrands Council, said : "While Apple is still perceived by influencers and the public alike to be the UK’s coolest brand, a concerted wave of fast-growing, entrepreneurial businesses are building momentum to seriously challenge its position. "Disruptive brands like Netflix, Spotify, Instagram, Airbnb and GoPro (proving Apple no longer has a monopoly on cool tech) continue to boost their credentials, consolidating their positions by either moving further up the Top 20 or entering for the first time." He added: "These rising stars have hit a sweet pot, retaining a positive reputation with influencers, while building their awareness and lustre among consumers. These challenger brands are utilising new technologies, new business models and new ways of thinking, while remaining accessible and useful; conversely many premium brands are falling, as evidenced by the significant drop in performance of the luxury fashion brands surveyed." The result follows a poll of 2,500 British consumers and a panel of 36 "key influencers", including musicians DJ Fresh, Ella Eyre and Labrinth, MOBO Founder Kanya King, fashion designers Melissa Odabash and Amanda Wakeley, bloggers and national magazine editors.

Sometimes, a hardware component goes bad. Here's how to diagnose and fix simple hardware problems. By David Gewirtz for DIY-IT | September 26, 2016 -- 13:54 GMT (06:54 PDT) | Topic: Apple Image: CNET I have a late 2012 Mac mini. Well, actually, I have four of them. But one of them was sick. In this article, I'll show you how I figured out what was wrong and then fixed it. It started a few months ago, when I installed Security Update 2016-001 for El Capitan. Immediately after running the update, my machine crashed over and over again. I did an in-place OS restore in order to preserve all my files and settings. That resulted in a crash to a black screen, right in the middle of the restore. I ran the restore again, which seemed to succeed. The machine returned to reasonably reliable behavior. Why my Mac Mini romance is over It was the perfect combination of compactness, just enough processor power and upgradeability that made it an excellent value for many Mac users. But now I can't recommend it anymore. Read More For a while. After a few weeks, I noticed that a development tool I run regularly wasn't behaving itself. It would launch and properly display the splash screen. But every time I touched the menu bar, it crashed. This problem was repeatable. The application was unusable. I rebooted. I had the same problem. I did another in-place OS restore. I still had the same problem. My first assumption was that the weird behavior was caused by an update to that program. But I checked, and it was actually the same version of the program that I had been running for the past year. The developer had upgraded the program, but hadn't offered any kind of upgrade discount. Since it had been meeting my needs, and running perfectly, I had chosen not to buy the upgrade. However, once the crashing started to occur, I downloaded a trial version of the upgrade. I had the same problem. It (and only it) crashed when touching the menu bar. Now, I had verified that the behavior was repeatable on multiple versions of the same program. I contacted the developer, and we went over the crash logs. There appeared to be an error generated in the main UI code for the Mac, but not for that application. A few days later, another application suddenly wouldn't launch. Or, more precisely, it launched, then immediately exited back to the desktop. This error wasn't as reliable, because it stopped once I rebooted. It was still odd. To diagnose the problem, I ran Disk Utility. My first go-to troubleshooting action is usually to repair disk permissions, since that's long been an easy way to fix minor problems. Gack! That's right, El Cap removed the disk permissions repair option because it interferes with system protection. Special. Even so, I did run the First Aid operation on my SSD. Everything turned out to be fine. Except my applications were still acting wonky. At that point, I started to wonder if I had a rare Mac hardware problem. I've had a lot of Macs over the years. I have had one or two hardware problems, but they've always manifested right after purchase. I've never had a machine fail years into use, so hardware failure was pretty much at the bottom of the list in terms of things I considered checking. The generation of Mac minis prior to the currently shipping one were quite user modifiable. Mine is a generation older than the newest ones. When I bought it in 2012, I added my own RAM sticks, and swapped out the dog-slow included hard drive for an SSD. Since I had run out of ideas as to why the machine was malfunctioning, I decided it couldn't hurt to run the hardware diagnostics. It's important to understand that Macs released before June 2013 were shipped with the Apple Hardware Test (AHT), while those produced after June 2013 come with Apple Diagnostics. Since my machine is a late 2012 machine, I used AHT. How to run Apple's diagnostics To initiate the Apple Hardware Test or Apple Diagnostics (depending on what year your machine was built), shut down your machine completely. Make sure your machine is completely powered off. Press the Power button and immediately press and hold the D key on your keyboard. If you boot into the Finder, power off and repeat. You will launch into either Apple Hardware Test or Apple Diagnostics Select your language, if asked Run the tests and write down the result Google the result and look for appropriate answers if the diagnostics report hardware failure. Once in the diagnostic system, I got the following screen: Apple Hardware Test running a scan Once the test completed, you can see that I did, indeed, have a hardware error. That there's your problem right there. Yer 4MEM/9 is out of whack. Tough break, that. Typing 0x7bda4190 into Google yielded nothing. But typing 4MEM/9 into Google immediately yielded a discussion board post that implied one of my RAM sticks was bad.

Replacing all 16GB was about a $70 expense. The next day, I had the RAM in hand. My late 2012 Mac mini is extremely easy to open. You simply flip it over, turn the big black base slightly, and pop it off. The RAM is right there. RAM Replacement takes about five minutes. The only trick is making sure you press in the new RAM sticks at about a 45 degree angle. Once that was done, I put the little machine back together, and plugged all its peripherals back in. I powered it up, and tested my software. Everything that had failed was now working. I've been running with it for about a week. I haven't had any additional problems, so I'm pretty sure that minor hardware issue was the problem. I'm very glad it didn't turn out to be some sort of out-of-warranty motherboard issue, because that would have been a lot more expensive. I was also glad I don't have the latest model of the Mac mini, because RAM isn't field replaceable in those machines. In this machine, the $70 memory fix was quick and easy. I'm glad to be back up and running. If you have weird glitches, remember to run either AHT or Apple Diagnostics. It could answer questions you might otherwise tear your hair out over for months.

Fred Katayama reports. Video Transcript Japan sensing a bad Apple. Reuters has learned regulators there are considering taking action against Apple over possible antitrust violations. Government sources said they're focusing on the iPhone maker's supply deal with three local carriers that may have helped it dominate the market. Apple accounts for nearly one in every two smartphones sold in Japan, making it one of its most profitable markets. Japan's Fair Trade Commission said NTT Docomo, KDDI, and Softbank were refusing to sell older surplus iPhone models to third party retailers. Sources say those older phones are sent to overseas markets. Sources also say the carriers buy the iPhones in bulk and sell them at a discount. Docomo sells the iPhone 7 at a price 30 percent lower than the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge under a two-year contract. A government official told Reuters, "The actions of the three operators alone do not account for the state of the market. We are getting closer to taking action." Asked about the antitrust concerns, Apple forwarded a link to a webpage saying it creates or supports 715,000 jobs in Japan and would not comment further. NTT Docomo said it's considering its response. KDDI said it has followed guidelines.

Investors should buy Apple shares as the decline spurred by a third-party research firm's negative report is unwarranted, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch, which reiterated its buy rating. The tech giant's stock fell 1.7 percent Friday on GfK's market research data on iPhone sales. "Our conversations suggest that the sellout data from a third party released Friday indicated iPhone 7/7+ sales down 25% Y/Y in International (non-North American) markets over the launch weekend," Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan wrote in a note to clients Sunday. "In our opinion this data is not representative of true demand. ... Apple may have allocated more supply to U.S. locations in general, and/or to its own retail stores in other countries vs. to other outlets. We would view the pullback in shares as a particularly attractive opportunity."

Trump: Where they stand on 7 top tech issues Ahead of Monday's debate, TechRepublic and CNET teamed up to look at where the candidates stand on cybersecurity, privacy, STEM and other topics affecting the tech industry. By Dan Patterson | Terry Collins | September 26, 2016, 6:39 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: iStockphoto/bearsky23 This article was originally published on CNET. Technology issues haven't dominated the US presidential campaign. But they're there. Security and privacy. The health of the economy. Schools and research. Immigration. In some way, all these issues are tech issues. That means the next president's science and technology policies will have long-lasting impact on the country. "Tech definitely needs to be a part of the discourse when we choose the next president of the United States," said Robert Atkinson, founder and president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, because it's "involved in almost every aspect of our lives." SEE: Clinton will beat Trump in innovation and technology at first debate, says TechRepublic's swarm AI Ahead of Monday's debate, CNET and TechRepublic compiled a list of the most important technology issues facing the country to get a sense of what a Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump administration might mean for the field. We used the candidates' websites, public statements and interviews with other publications to research their positions. We also contacted both campaigns for additional comment on their technology policies. The Clinton team sent us a detailed list of her comments on the issues and directed us to her website. The Trump team didn't respond to repeated requests for comment. Cybersecurity Clinton In February, Clinton called cybersecurity one of "the most important challenges the next president is going to face," citing the offensive advances of Russia, China, Iran and North Korea. In the National Security section of Clinton's website, the candidate directly addresses risks posed by Russian and Chinese hackers. Trump Trump's campaign website provides scant detail on his cybersecurity policy. However, the candidate told The New York Times that "certainly cyber has to be in our thought process, very strongly in our thought process...Inconceivable the power of cyber...you can make countries nonfunctioning with a strong use of cyber." Trump also made a comment thatseemed to encourage the Russian government to hack Clinton's email. The remark was criticized by FBI chief James Comey. Trump later said he was being sarcastic. SEE: Cyber defense in financial services: Trends, strategies, and best practices (Tech Pro Research report) Privacy and encryption Clinton Clinton has a complex relationship with privacy and encryption. Her use of a private email server while serving as secretary of state has dogged her campaign. She argued for compromise during the Apple-FBI standoff over whether Apple should be forced to help the agency crack into an iPhone used be a terrorist, and her policy position supports the formation of a commission to strike a balance between individual privacy and national security. "Hillary rejects the false choice between privacy interests and keeping Americans safe," says her position statement. Trump Trump hasn't issued a policy statement but his words indicate he isn't sympathetic to privacy concerns when public safety is involved. He's suggested the government should have access to encrypted devices, and he called out Apple during the tech giant's standoff with the FBI. "Who do they think they are?" Trump said. "They have to open it up." ICANN Clinton The US should leave coordinating the domain name system that addresses internet sites to Los Angeles-based ICANN, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, which takes over on October 1, Clinton says.The ICANN transition is "a critical step towards safeguarding the internet's openness for future generations," says the Clinton policy. ICANN is in charge of the Domain Name System (DNS) and is in charge of assigning IP addresses to top-level domains like .com, .net and .org. Trump Trump says the US should control the internet, end of story, and he objects to passing control to ICANN. "Congress needs to act, or internet freedom will be lost for good, since there will be no way to make it great again once it is lost," said Trump National Policy Director Stephen Miller said in a statementTuesday. For a detailed look at the ICANN issue, check out our rundown here. STEM Clinton When it comes to STEM, or science, technology, engineering and mathematics subjects, Clinton's website enumerates a three-point plan with significant investments in such education, a proposal that's nested in a detailed economic proposal. "A new generation of potential scientists, engineers, coders, and mathematicians are learning in classrooms across America right now," she says. Her plan proposes spending and support in the private and public sectors at the regional and national levels. Trump Trump has no specific STEM policy but has noted on his website that "we graduate two times more Americans with STEM degrees each year than find STEM jobs." H-1B visas Clinton Speaking to a group of Silicon Valley entrepreneurs in 2007 Clinton expressed support for H-1B visas, temporary visas for skilled workers. Her website states that Clinton would "staple" a green card to STEM masters and Ph.D.s from accredited institutions, enabling international students who complete degrees in these fields a path to permanent residence. Clinton also would support "startup" visas that let entrepreneurs from abroad come to the US to build tech companies. Election Tech Election tech: Lies, damned lies, and statistics In the aftermath of the election, pollsters and pundits are scrambling to account for misguided forecasts. What went wrong (and right)? Political analysts weigh in on the role of data in politics. Read more Trump Trump's policy seeks to increase the pay for people holding H-1Bs as part of a plan to steer more work to Americans. "Raising the prevailing wage paid to H-1Bs will force companies to give...coveted entry-level jobs to the existing domestic pool of unemployed native and immigrant workers in the US, instead of flying in cheaper workers from overseas," his policy says. Innovation Clinton Clinton's nearly 7,000-word Initiative on Technology & Innovation uses technology as the center of a broad platform of economic issues. The proposal includes funding for classroom technology and spurring tech exports. Clinton's plan is supported by several major influential Silicon Valley technologists. Trump Trump hasn't expressed much on the subject of innovation and research. But Silicon Valley has weighed in on the candidate's potential impact. "Trump would be a disaster for innovation," according to a July open letter signed by nearly 150 tech leaders, including Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian and Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales. Atkinson, of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, said Trump's background in real estate isn't "really geared toward innovation." Taxes Clinton Clinton opposes tax inversions. A tax inversion is a legal tactic that allows companies to migrate their tax burden to a country with a lower rate, while keeping primary corporate operations in the originating country. The practice has been associated with biotechnology companies and pharmaceutical firms. "I call it a perversion, but under the tax code it's called an inversion," she declared on her website. "And we will make you pay for that with a new exit tax." SEE: Three ways encryption can safeguard your cloud files (Tech Pro Research report) Trump Trump wants to encourage US companies to build at home by instituting a 35 percent tax on products made outside of the US. He singled out Apple during a January stump speech saying, "We're going to get Apple to build their damn computers and things in this country instead of in other countries." Apple, which declined to comment on Trump's comments at the time he made them, designs many of its products at its Silicon Valley headquarters and has them assembled in China. If Apple products were manufactured in the US, the price of an iPhone potentially could rise to around $900 to offset worker wages.

I don’t like being force-fed Windows 10 Cortana: The spy in Windows 10 Would you subscribe to Windows? Show More Thanks to a friend who worships at the church of Apple, I’ve gotten my first look at Apple’s AirPods. They’re just as annoying as I’d expected. To catch you up on the story, Apple dumped the headphone jack in iPhone 7. Why? Was there a change.org petition to get rid of old, working technology? Nope. According to Apple’s senior vice president of worldwide marketing, Phil Schiller, it was so Apple could make an even skinnier phone and/or add new technology. Because, don’t you know, what the world needs now is an even thinner iPhone. The real reason, of course, is that Apple wants to shear more money from its sheep. All those expensive Apple Beats earpods and headphones you’ve bought recently? They’re all old junk on their way to obsolescence, if you believe Apple. Instead, you’ll need $159 AirPods. They don't come with your pricey new iPhone 7. Apple really does want to squeeze out every last dollar from its customers. Oh, and guess what. You’re going to lose those AirPods. That isn’t a threat. That’s a promise. It’s all I can do to keep track of my Era by Jawbone Bluetooth headset, and it’s seldom off my head during a business day. You’re going to be taking the AirPods, with their inadequate five-hour (well, more like three, really) battery life, off and on constantly. You will lose them. It’s only a matter of time. Heck, you may want to lose them. I mean, do you want to look like you have Q-tips sticking out of your ears? I don’t! You can, of course, use regular — not to mention cheaper — Bluetooth headsets, but you’ll lose — Apple’s own words — the “magic.” What magic? I don’t expect good audio from Apple products, but the AirPods’ sound quality is far worse than Apple’s already “meh” earpods. If you really want to listen to music from your iPhone 6 or earlier, bite the bullet and shell out $250 for the Bose QuietComfort 20. Yes, the Bose cost a lot. But, guess what, they’re worth it and they won’t become a cat toy when you’re not looking. Or, if you really insist on wireless, go with the JBL Reflect Mini BT for $100. One reason I’m willing to pay serious money for headsets and earpods is that active noise cancellation makes using them, not to mention listening to music, much more enjoyable. Guess what Apple doesn’t include in the AirPods? Why, yes, that would be active noise cancellation. Of course, you could use the Apple-supplied dongle to connect your old earpods via the iPhone’s 7 Lightning port. Well, you can, but it doesn’t work that well. In my experience, whenever you add another link to an audio connection, the quality goes downhill. That proved to be true yet again. So, let me sum this up for you. Apple, for no reason other than to increase its profits and further lock in customers to its technologies, is forcing its customers to buy expensive, second-rate technology. No thank you.

I’ve been talking about Apple’s interest in digital health for years. Bit by bit my expectations on this are proving correct, with Apple developing Health, Activity, Care Kit, Research Kit, advanced biometric sensors and apps for wheelchair users, swimming and even breathing. An Apple a day Apple wants to be good for you None of these efforts are trivial. The company is working with health professionals, expert scientists and government regulators in its attempt to create a digital health ecosystem that actually does keep you well. “Health is a huge issue around the world and we think it’s ripe for simplicity and a new view,” Apple CEO, Tim Cook told a May conference in Amsterdam. The company is also willing to go the extra mile and invest in good research and good science for its health solutions. Last week I learned that the Swimming Activity app you will find in Apple Watch Series 2 is based on over a million swim hours of data. Apple has confirmed that Wheelchair is based on similar high investment in research time. Meanwhile the sensors Apple is introducing take years to develop. This is not a trivial attempt, and these things work. Bloomberg today confirms what I pointed out just last week: That Apple wants to expand HealthKit from being a basic fitness tracker to becoming a useful diagnosis tool. Next generation digital health The Bloomberg report claims Apple is working on an app that figures out an Apple Watch wearer’s fitness levels “by measuring the time taken for the heart rate to fall from its peak to resting level.” Earlier this year Apple filed a patent for an Apple Watch that can constantly monitor a wearer’s heartbeat, warning them of impending heart attack. The big ambition is to gather lots of useful data, generate useful real-time insights from that information, and to make it easy to bring that information into the fragmented landscape of Electronic Health Records across the industry (hence the Gliimpse acquisition). The big idea is to give physicians access to the quality and quantity of accurate biometric data they need in order to improve treatment and diagnosis. Regulatory challenges The report points out that Apple will need to get regulatory clearance for some of the solutions it is developing, and may need to pop an LTE radio inside the Watch in order that the device is always connected. “We don’t want to put the watch through the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) process,” Tim Cook told the UK Daily Telegraph this year. “I wouldn’t mind putting something adjacent to the watch through it, but not the watch, because it would hold us back from innovating too much, the cycles are too long. But you can begin to envision other things that might be adjacent to it -- maybe an app, maybe something else.” We already know that while developing Apple Watch the company considered different sensor technologies to provide stress, heart rate and blood pressure monitors, but rejected those that didn’t perform consistently or required regulatory approval. Technology and healthcare Speaking in 2013, Ovum’s then lead Healthcare & Life Sciences analyst, Charlotte Davies told me of her predictions for digital health, “More and more care will be delivered outside hospitals and clinics… mobile devices – from smartphones to monitoring devices – will become increasingly important as the number of patients cared for at home or in sheltered accommodation or other community centers increases,” she said. Apple’s health team includes key researchers with a background in the application of big data analytics on health care. This connects to Apple’s recent investments in machine intelligence, leading me to anticipate anonymized but accurate public health solutions from the company. Apple’s plan for health This is what I imagine Apple’s digital health strategy is built around: To offer consumer products (principally Apple Watch) that among their many other features also offer the best available health and fitness trackers and FDA-approved biometric and system sensors. While protecting customer privacy and security to ensure the data gathered by these devices can be securely shared with leading Electronic Health Systems currently used in healthcare, and that medical professionals can quickly and easily access this data, even remotely. (88% of physicians want patients to monitor their health parameters at home). To link doctors and their clients together so both sides receive early alerts if sensors detect potential crisis. To provide patients with an emergency system so they can request help if necessary (now available in iOS 10). These solutions will have implications in health insurance and employment. CDW Healthcare claims: “Wearable technology could drop hospital costs by as much as 16% over the course of 5 years, and remote patient monitoring technologies could save our healthcare system $200 billion over the next 25 years.” Data analytics What the Bloomberg report today suggests is that Apple is determined to invest a huge chunk of cash into figuring out how its technologies can be good for you. Of course, all this data has further implications in data analytics. I suggest Apple wants to continue working with differential privacy until Apple customers can securely and privately contribute to research studies aimed at using these technologies to monitor and track public health. Apple’s relationship with IBM and that company’s own investments in data analytics for health also seem likely to come into play. Digital health is going to become a key business for Apple, but its apparent commitment to delivering solutions based on good science will hopefully drive good benefits to everybody. Indeed, it may be easier to innovate in health than in the ever more complex automated vehicle sector). One app at a time your smart-something will in future save your life. Google+?

To keep their apps alive on the App Store, Apple is demanding that developers submit updated versions for review within 30 days. After the 30 days have passed, Apple will remove any outdated apps from the store “until you submit an update and it is approved”. Any removed apps will remain fully functional for current users who have downloaded it prior to the removal. Users will “experience no interruption to services, will still be able to buy In-App Purchases and can re-download the app while restoring from an iCloud or iTunes backup,” writes Apple. The iPhone maker cautioned on September 1 that beginning September 7 it’d start purging the App Store of poorly maintained apps, zombie apps which haven’t seen an update in ages and abandoned apps that no longer function as advertised. Apps that don’t follow iOS development guidelines are getting removed, too. Lastly, Apple is no longer accepting submissions and app updates with names longer than 50 characters because it found that some developers have resorted to using “extremely long” app names in an attempt to influence App Store search results.

Abhinav Chaudhary Not me AMB_07 I thought it was concerning apps about zombies too lol Prasoon Singh Same lol Aniruddh Kothari Me Agneev Mukherjee I thought they would remove Hitman: Sniper after I saw that title. LOL Jamessmooth Thats exactly what I was gonna comment. I just had about 10 emotions in 10 seconds. what a roller coaster. JRDN Lol guys did not expect a ton of people to agree with me. Our comments ended up changing the title. For those who missed it, the article was originally titled as “Apple begins removing zombie apps from the App Store”. Also, guys, it was not click bait. Those apps are called zombie apps. stylesbeyond about time way to many crappy dated apps Agneev Mukherjee Especially em’ Japanese ones… pnh Why would they remove zombie apps a month before Halloween? Agneev Mukherjee That’s the Halloween spirit. Bugs Bunnay Because it’s racist to kill zombies. Alan Aurmont Bye bye, AppShopper :(( Stetch Yeah its sad … used that one since it first arrived on appstore … Alan Aurmont Glad it still works though, albeit with an ugly and severely outdated interface. Stetch AppZapp is another app I use for the same purpose. Alan Aurmont Heard of it but too lazy to copy thousands of apps to AppZapp. Stetch Hehe yeah … I wonder if you can export the games as text from the AppShopper website … Timothy Try saving the website as an icon to your home screen; the web version is much cleaner-looking. Agneev Mukherjee Zombie? Because your surname starts with Z? Erick Reyes What? Agneev Mukherjee I meant the author i.e. Christian Zibreg. Riley Freeman headline here could have significantly better. Reading the headlines makes it sound like apple is targeting one specific group. Not until you read the article do you see what it’s actually about. Why not just go with “apple begins removing apps that have not been updated” or is this just click bait? Fede777 How much time does “We noticed that your app has not been updated in a significant amount of time” mean? (JailbreakQA) King Shoot There are a lot of iPhone OS 3 + apps I want, so I should probably download them now and make a Dropbox + Mega + Local backup. Maybe even zip them and put them on a CD-R >.> ListenUpGuys I don’t think CD-R is a reliable way to back-up. I’m interested in which old apps you’d like to get. Would you mind telling us a few? 🙂 Dino Din yesssss! like tap tap games! tap tap revenge!!! Tony Trenkle Jr. Horrible article title…I thought they were removing actual Zombie apps from the app store. I was like wtf would they do that for? Smh. Bugs Bunnay Headline society. Volerikan Can confirm, one of my games was removed.

TechRadar The source for Tech Buying Advice Search RSS Reviews How To Phones TVs Laptops Deals Photography More Car Tech Wearables Tablets Components Audiovisual Gaming Computing Downloads News Pro Trending Buying Guides iPhone 8 Nintendo Switch Samsung Galaxy S8 MacBook Pro CES 2017 iOS 10.2 News All the Macs that mattered: the 20 most important Apple computers ever All the Macs that mattered: the 20 most important Apple computers ever By Gary Marshall PC   It's the return of the Mac Shares Introduction The Mac is in its third decade, and it's still going strong: we're expecting to see a radically redesigned MacBook Pro next month, and we're hoping for an updated 2016 iMac too - although there's a good chance we might have to wait until WWDC for that one. Today's Macs are very different from the earliest models, of course. The first Mac had 128 kilobytes of memory; the iMac we're writing this on has 16 gigabytes. It's a bit faster, too. But whether it's a Mac SE or a MacBook Air, most Macs have something that sets them apart from other people's PCs - although even Apple has made the odd duffer. Here are some of Apple's greatest Macs, and a few Mac misses too. This article is part of TechRadar's Mac Week. This year marks not only the 10th anniversary of Apple's MacBook, but the triumphant return of macOS. So, TechRadar looks to celebrate with a week's worth of original features delving back into the Mac's past, predicting the Mac's future and exploring the Mac as it is today. Prev Page 1 of 21 Next Prev Page 1 of 21 Next 1. Apple Macintosh Date of launch: January 1984 Price at launch: $1,495 / $2,495 The first Mac was the first mass-market personal computer with a graphical user interface and mouse. Apple spent so much money advertising the original Macintosh that CEO John Scully promptly upped the price by $1,000 to try and recoup that money, but despite such tomfoolery the Mac sold well: 50,000 were sold by April, and in the first year Apple sold 280,000 Macs. Its 128KB of RAM proved to be insufficient for many, and a 512KB version was introduced later the same year with a price tag of $3,195. Prev Page 2 of 21 Next Prev Page 2 of 21 Next 2. Macintosh Plus Date of launch: January 1986 Price at launch: $2,600 The Mac Plus was a big success, and wasn't discontinued until late 1990. It had a massive 1MB of RAM, expandable to an even more massive 4MB, an 800KB floppy disk drive and a SCSI interface enabling users to add peripherals such as hard disk drives, printers, scanners and other key devices. It was fanless, which meant it ran really quietly. Unfortunately that also made it prone to overheating. Prev Page 3 of 21 Next Prev Page 3 of 21 Next 3. Macintosh II Date of launch: March 1987 Price at launch: $5,500 For all its joys, the Macintosh didn't have something even the simplest phone has today: a colour display. The Macintosh II changed that, although if you wanted a fully loaded version with colour monitor, hard disk, keyboard and RAM you could double the already hefty $5.5K price tag. Its modular design meant a more PC-style case instead of the all-in-one designs of earlier Macs. Prev Page 4 of 21 Next Prev Page 4 of 21 Next 4. Macintosh SE Date of launch: March 1987 Price at launch: $2,900 For many people, the SE is the Mac that springs to mind when they hear "Macintosh". Introduced alongside the Macintosh II with a cheaper price tag - $2,900, or $3,900 if you wanted a hard disk - the SE could have one or two floppy drives or a floppy drive and a hard drive. It had a fan, too, so it didn't suffer from the heat problems of its more expensive sibling. If you spot a transparent one, snap it up: they were promotional prototypes and Apple only made 10, so they're worth a fortune. Prev Page 5 of 21 Next Prev Page 5 of 21 Next 5. Macintosh Classic Date of launch: October 1990 Price at launch: $1,000 The Classic is significant, not because of its specs but because of its sticker price: it was the first Mac to be sold for less than $1,000. Macs had been getting pricier and pricier - the Macintosh IIfx was $9,900 before you added a keyboard or monitor - and with Microsoft's good-enough Windows 3.0 selling like hotcakes, Apple's sales started to decline. The Classic was an attempt to change that, and it was particularly popular in the educational market. Prev Page 6 of 21 Next Prev Page 6 of 21 Next 6. Macintosh LC Date of launch: October 1990 Price at launch: $2,500 LC stands for "low-cost color" and the Elsie was effectively a Mac Classic with a color-capable video card. Like the Classic it was priced to sell, this time at $2,500, but to hit that price Apple had to cut some corners - and while it was a huge success with over 500,000 LCs sold in the first year it was compromised from the outset. Prev Page 7 of 21 Next Prev Page 7 of 21 Next 7. PowerBook 100 Date of launch: October 1991 Price at launch: $2,300 The PowerBook 100 wasn't the first portable Mac - that was the Macintosh Portable in 1989 - but it was the first popular portable Mac, raking in $1 billion in sales in its first year. It was a collaboration between Apple and Sony, who also manufactured the computer. PC World called the 100 the tenth-greatest PC of all time back in 2006, and the portable won stacks of design awards for its brilliance. Prev Page 8 of 21 Next Prev Page 8 of 21 Next 8. Macintosh Quadra Date of launch: October 1991 Price at launch: $6,000 The Quadras were the Mac Pros of the 1990s, using Motorola's whizzy 68040 CPU and aimed squarely at power users. The Quadra 700 could be upgraded to 68MB of RAM, had 512KB of video memory expandable to 2MB and was capable of displaying 1152 x 870, or 832x624 in 24-bit colour if you maxed out the VRAM. Eagle-eyed, moviegoing Apple fans may have spotted its guest appearance in Jurassic Park. Prev Page 9 of 21 Next Prev Page 9 of 21 Next 9. Power Macintosh 6100 Date of launch: March 1994 Price at launch: $1,820 The Power Mac was the Quadra's replacement and used the new AIM (Apple, IBM and Motorola) PowerPC processor to run the latest Mac OS, Mac OS 9. The Power Mac would hang around for more than a decade - Apple didn't stop selling PowerPC Power Macs until 2006 - and the models fall into two camps: Old World ROM models, which featured the Macintosh Toolbox ROM chip, and New World ROM models, which didn't and which used third, fourth and eventually fifth generation PowerPC processors (the G3, G4 and G5 respectively). Prev Page 10 of 21 Next Prev Page 10 of 21 Next 10. iMac G3 Date of launch: August 1998 Price at launch: $1,299 Apple was in trouble. Sales were in freefall, the product range was a mess and there was only one person who could sort it out: the newly returned Steve Jobs. Jobs slashed the product portfolio, canned projects across the company and presided over the launch of one of the most extraordinary computers ever made, the MacMan. Luckily for Apple, Jobs was persuaded to call it the iMac instead. Jonathan Ive's design influenced not just computers, but all kinds of products ranging from steam irons to sex toys, and the controversial decision to kill off the floppy drive proved to be sensible rather than the act of madness many observers said it was. Prev Page 11 of 21 Next Prev Page 11 of 21 Next 11. iBook G3 Date of launch: June 1999 Price at launch: $1,599 The iBook wasn't just one of the most lovable computers ever made. It also popularised a relatively obscure technology known as Wi-Fi. The fun design wouldn't last - the iBook became considerably more sober with the launch of the "Snow" dual-USB iBook in 2001 - but it was another very visual indication that Apple was really thinking different from the rest of the PC industry. Prev Page 12 of 21 Next Prev Page 12 of 21 Next 12. Power Mac G4 Cube Date of launch: July 2000 Price at launch: $1,799 The Cube was fascinating and flawed: it cost significantly more than similarly-specced Power Macs, its acrylic case suffered from a manufacturing fault that caused cracks in the acrylic case and to some eyes it looked a bit like a toaster. It wasn't a huge success but it retains a cult following, and a few have been made into "macquariums". Apple would try the small-PC thing again a few years later with considerably more success. Prev Page 13 of 21 Next Prev Page 13 of 21 Next 13. PowerBook G4 Date of launch: January 2001 Price at launch: $2,599 The PowerBook was a radical departure from Apple's previous pro-laptop designs, dropping dark plastics in favour of shiny titanium and reversing the Apple logo so it looked the right way up to other people. You can see the PowerBook G4's DNA in all of Apple's current laptops, from the ultra-thin MacBook to the Retina MacBook Pro: the Titanium Powerbook, or TiBook for short, is clearly the grandparent of the Apple portables of today. Titanium proved to be problematic, so later PowerBooks - and their descendants - were machined from aluminium instead. Prev Page 14 of 21 Next Prev Page 14 of 21 Next 14. iMac G4 Date of launch: January 2002 Price at launch: $1,299 The original iMac was limited design-wise because it needed to include a huge CRT tube. Not so with the G4, which had a digital LCD instead. The candy colours of the first iMac had been so widely copied that they'd become a design cliché, so Apple went in a different direction for the new model. Some people see sunflowers; we see Luxo Jr, Pixar's anglepoise mascot. The LCD made the iMac considerably more expensive, so Apple kept a CRT model for the education market and called it the eMac. Prev Page 15 of 21 Next Prev Page 15 of 21 Next 15. iMac G5 Date of launch: August 2004 Price at launch: $1,299 Looking at it now, the iMac G5 sits perfectly between the anglepoise G4 and the aluminium iMacs we have now, but at the time it looked really futuristic. It may seem porky compared to today's ultra-thin iMacs, but in 2004 Apple was able to claim that it had made the thinnest desktop computer on the market. It's a masterpiece of something Apple has become really good at: squeezing lots of computer into increasingly smaller spaces. Prev Page 16 of 21 Next Prev Page 16 of 21 Next 16. Mac mini Date of launch: January 2005 Price at launch: $499 In the 1990s, Apple lost market share to Windows. In the 2000s, Apple went on the attack. Designed specifically to tempt price-conscious Windows users, the Mac mini eschewed keyboard, monitor and mouse to keep the price below $500. Essentially a laptop in the body of a very small desktop, the Mini wasn't as quick as its siblings - but it was an awful lot cheaper. Prev Page 17 of 21 Next Prev Page 17 of 21 Next 17. iMac (Core Duo) Date of launch: January 2006 Price at launch: $1,299 Hell froze over: Apple was using Intel processors, and the iMac was the first recipient. Apple had grown increasingly frustrated with the slow improvements in the PowerPC processor, and PowerPC Macs were lagging further and further behind PCs in the performance stakes. Swapping the G5 for a Core Duo nearly tripled the iMac's speed, and Intel processors would go on to power all Macs by the end of 2006. Prev Page 18 of 21 Next Prev Page 18 of 21 Next 18. MacBook Air Date of launch: January 2008 Price at launch: $1,799 Steve Jobs introduced it by pulling it out of an envelope. The MacBook Air was the world's thinnest laptop, and while the specs weren't brilliant the portability more than compensated for it. The Air made other notebooks seem massive, and subsequent iterations ironed out some of the niggling issues such as processor performance and battery life. It was, and remains, a best-seller for Apple. Prev Page 19 of 21 Next Prev Page 19 of 21 Next 19. Mac Pro Date of launch: December 2013 Price at launch: $2,999 Darth Vader's Dustbin is an extraordinary piece of engineering, with no visual similarities to the Mac Pros it replaced: the first-generation Mac Pro looked like the Power Mac G5, but the current model is one-eighth of the size despite supporting up to 12-core Xeons, four DDR3 RAM slots and dual GPUs. It's the most powerful Mac ever made. Prev Page 20 of 21 Next Prev Page 20 of 21 Next 20. MacBook Date of launch: April 2015 Price at launch: $1,299 Thirty-two years after the first Macintosh, it's clear that Macs can still excite and delight. The 2015 MacBook isn't just a beautiful piece of engineering. It's also the clearest indication of where Apple is right now, with a design that's clearly related to the latest iPhones and iPads and an operating system that brings Apple MacBook, Apple Watch, Apple iPhone and Apple iPad together in perfect harmony. The lines between Macs and iOS devices are getting awfully blurry, especially here: choosing between the MacBook and the iPad Pro is a genuinely tough decision.

The App Store offers a convenient route to download a huge number of apps, and there's even more out there on the web. If you instead plan to grab some apps from the web, don't forget to head over to your Settings > Security & Privacy > General panel first to set 'Allow apps to download from: Anywhere'. Before changing it back afterwards, obviously. From note-taking apps to image editors, windows managers and music production suites, check out our list of the best macOS apps that you can download today. This article is part of TechRadar's Mac Week. This year marks not only the 10th anniversary of Apple's unibody MacBook, but the triumphant return of macOS. So, TechRadar looks to celebrate with a week's worth of original features delving back into the Mac's past, predicting the Mac's future and exploring the Mac as it is today. Prev Page 1 of 11 Next Prev Page 1 of 11 Next 1. Amphetamine Get it from: App Store Price: Free Sometimes you might want to save space on your desk by putting your MacBook to sleep and slipping it into a vertical holder. The problem there is that macOS automatically enters sleep mode when the lid is closed — and there's no way to prevent this from happening without a third-party app. Caffeine used to be the best solution doing the rounds, but it has been usurped by Amphetamine. Not only does Amphetamine look better in your Mac's Menu Bar (in Dark Mode, anyway) and features support for Retina displays, you can set hotkeys to turn it on and off, activate it using keyboard shortcuts, receive alerts when it deactivates (via the Notification Center) and, best of all, it's 100% ad free. It's better than that first coffee in the morning, in other words. Prev Page 2 of 11 Next Prev Page 2 of 11 Next 2. HyperDock Get it from: App Store Price: £7.99 (around $10 or AUS$14) Windows received the ability to snap windows and programs to the edges of the screen way back in Windows 7, so we're quite surprised Apple took so long to replicated it with Split view in OS X El Capitan. But it still isn't quite as full featured as Microsoft's solution. The good news is that third-party apps to fill in the gaps, with the best being HyperDock, which covers window management and Dock functionality. For windows, you can drag an app to the left or right edges of the screen (or the corners) and it'll automatically fill that space. This makes it much easier to be productive on the desktop without wasting time dragging windows from the corners. For the Dock, hovering over apps activates something similar to Windows 7's thumbnail previews, providing overviews of windows that can be accessed by a click or closed directly from the preview. Handy. Prev Page 3 of 11 Next Prev Page 3 of 11 Next 3. Parallels Desktop 12 Get it from: Parallels Price: $79.99/year (Home & Student) Around £60 or AUS$100) If you've bought a Mac and miss some of your old Windows programs, don't worry - Parallels Desktop 12 can make it happen. Instead of having to dual-boot your Mac into a Windows partition, Parallels Desktop 12 allows Windows and macOS Sierra to co-exist side-by-side, and you can even run Microsoft-only programs such as Visual Studio 2015, or the Windows versions of the company's Office 365 apps, alongside your native macOS ones. All you need is a Windows 10 license - so prepare to buy one if you haven't already. Or, alternatively, you can use Parallels to try a handful of free operating systems including Chromium (a free distribution of Chrome OS) or Linux Debian. This year's version of Parallels is the most useful yet thanks to a new addition called the Parallels Toolbox, which allows you to easily carry out common tasks — from taking a screenshot to downloading YouTube and Facebook videos, and password-protecting all of your files.

Portable monitors are still fairly expensive (and not to mention bulky), and luckily you can use an iPad instead using a nifty app called Duet. Developed by ex-Apple engineers, it works by tethering your iPad to your Mac using one of Apple's Lightning cables and firing up the app on both devices. You can then drag windows and apps onto your iPad's display just like you can a second monitor, and if you have a more recent iPad with a Retina display then you'll get the full benefit of all those pixels. Just know that the bandwidth isn't quite what you would get with a proper monitor, so it can be a bit laggy when you notch the quality up. But it's still more than usable for reading websites, typing up documents and watching videos. Prev Page 5 of 11 Next Prev Page 5 of 11 Next 5. Atom Get it from: Atom Price: Free Atom is a text editor that's primarily designed for coders, but its flexibility and customization options make it a viable option for many different types of users. That's because of two reasons: first, you can download a number of different Packages - effectively plug-ins - to make it bend to your will. It can be transformed into a Markdown editor for writing blog posts, for example, or you can hook it up to Evernote for storing notes in the cloud. There's at least 10 different word counters out there, and you can even add typewriter sound effects as you hammer out your delicious prose. Atom is also infinitely customizable on the visual side thanks to an editable back-end, allowing you to do anything from changing the font size, line height and colors to giving the caret Word 2016-like elasticity.

Logic Pro X Get it from: App Store Price: £149.99 (around $195 or AUS$255) Whether you're an aspiring rockstar or superstar DJ, Logic Pro X is one of the best music creation apps on the Mac. Developed by Apple itself,76 its accessible interface hides a ton of advanced functionality. The latest version comes with a slick new design, 64-bit architecture and new session drummer that will save you having to shell out for a drum machine. It also works in natural harmony with iPads, providing a touch-based alternative method of creating song structures to dragging and dropping blocks in the main visual editor. Whether you're a seasoned producer already (Sia used the app to record her hit song 'Chandelier') or are looking to upgrade from Garageband, Logic Pro X likely has what you need.

Wunderlist Get it from: App Store Price: Free A simple app but an important one, to-do app Wunderlist's strength lies in its cross-device functionality. It's available on Mac, PC and Android and iOS, allowing you to pick up where you left off wherever you are using macOS's Handoff feature. Once you've created a list you can schedule reminders, add notes and embed it into the macOS Notification Centre using a widget. Team-based features are unlocked by signing up to Wunderlist's Pro option for a yearly fee, and you can add files of any size without running into limits.

While some people will say that it's too bloated, the sheer number of things that you can do with it still makes it best-in-class. You can type up notes, obviously, organizing them using a combination of folders and tags. You can even embed Google Drive documents, which are accessible in a click. There's also the ability to set reminders, share notes with friends, find information related to notes using Evernote's 'Context' feature, create lists, and favorite notes that you frequently return to. Better yet, all of your notes are synchronized using the company's servers, making them accessible on nearly any PC (through a browser or the native Evernote app) or mobile device in the world. The paid version lets you use Evernote with more than two devices while upping the amount of data you can sync each month. Prev Page 9 of 11 Next Prev Page 9 of 11 Next 9. GIMP Get it from: Website Price: Free GIMP (standing for GNU Image Manipulation) is one of the best free image editing apps out there. It's a great alternative to Adobe Photoshop and comes with a massive array of professional-quality functions that let you tweak existing images saved in a range of formats or create fresh ones from scratch. Features include layers, highly customizable brushes, automatic image-enhancing tools and filters. You can do even more with it using plug-ins, which are available to download from the GIMP Plugin Registry. Prev Page 10 of 11 Next Prev Page 10 of 11 Next 10. Ulysses Get it from: App Store Price: £34.99 (around $45/AUS$60) Ulysses is one of the best "distraction-free" markdown editors out there today, balancing features with simplicity and beautiful design. Unlike Word 2016, or even Apple's own Pages, Ulysses hardly features an interface at all. This allows you to get on with writing without being distracted by superfluous buttons and menus. The app uses its own brand of Markdown — a type of text formatting engine — that lets you highlight your writing in a way that makes organizing it simpler, and a vast number of export styles formats it in an attractive way once you're finished. There's a handy attachments bar on the right-hand side that features an attractive word counter and lets you write notes to assist you in your writing. Notes can be accessed anywhere thanks to iCloud support, so you can pick up your iPad and carry on where you left off using macOS's Handoff feature.

By John Gruber Archive The Talk Show Projects Contact Colophon RSS Feed Twitter Sponsorship The Curious Case of Chris Ziegler’s Employment at The Verge and Apple Nilay Patel: Hey everyone — there have been questions about Chris Ziegler and his absence from The Verge in the past few weeks. I want to provide answers for those who have been worried about him. First, Chris accepted a position at Apple. We wish him well. […] Chris began working for Apple in July, but didn’t tell anyone at The Verge that he’d taken a new job until we discovered and verified his dual-employment in early September. Chris continued actively working at The Verge in July, but was not in contact with us through most of August and into September. During that period, in the dark and concerned for Chris, we made every effort to contact him and to offer him help if needed. We ultimately terminated his employment at The Verge and Vox Media the same day we verified that he was employed at Apple. This is really bizarre. Obviously The Verge can’t have staff members simultaneously working for one of the companies they cover, but surely Apple would consider this just as much of a conflict of interest as The Verge would. No word on what Ziegler is (or was? — several little birdies have told me Ziegler is not listed in the company directory) doing at Apple. And Ziegler’s Twitter account has been silent since August 8. ★ Friday, 23 September 2016 Display Preferences Copyright © 2002–2017 The Daring Fireball Company LLC. Ads via The Deck
TV MOVIES TOP TENS MUSIC LIFESTYLE FLASH GAMES Bill Maher takes on Trump, Apple iPhone 7 and bad police training 26th September 2016 by April Neale According to Bill Maher on Real Time, Apple needs to click back the innovations a bit On the latest Real Time, Bill Maher took on GOP presidential candidate Donald J. Trump, “bad police training” and the never-ending reinventing of Apple, which Maher thinks is excessive. Bill and his guests – Maureen Dowd, Lanhee Chen, Neera Tanden, Max Brooks, and Michael Franti – hashed over tonight’s looming Monday debate between Trump and Hillary and talked about the disturbing racial tension in the country. During the monologue, Maher talked about the Trump vs Hillary-debate preview. Maher said: “Liberals are very nervous, for good reason…she’s the British in her red pantsuit and Trump is fighting a guerrilla war, and I’m not just saying that because his father was an orangutan!” The opening interview featured a feverish and sick Maureen Dowd who joked: “I much prefer watching you [Maher] from bed.” Dowd dished on her interesting relationship with the Bushes and how George H.W. Bush would throw his shoe at the TV when Trump appeared — and even called Trump “an ass”. Her fascinating interview with Bill about how much the Bushes hate Trump did not disappoint. She said: “I went down to have lunch with [George H.W. Bush] in 2011 and it was right at the height of the birther thing and I was talking to him about that…Donald Trump was leading the birther moment, and former President Bush goes, ‘He’s an ass’.” She continued: “He was talking about how much he [George H.W. Bush] really loved Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, so I can only imagine how painful it was to see Jeb [Bush], who he had always wanted to be president, get destroyed in the debate stage by what Trump refers to as a ‘one-day kill’… the ‘low-energy’ thing. And so Bush Sr. would throw his shoe at the TV set when Trump would come on. When he saw Trump, he would just throw it.” Up until recently, Dowd was not on Trump’s radar for insults until a recent column. Maher said: “I know you’ve been friends with [Trump] for years, and this is what he tweeted about you recently.” During the broadcast, Maher talked about police training and the death of Terence Crutcher in Tulsa. “I could never be a cop, and I admire that they can, but, look, you have to do it better,” he said during the mid-show interview with musician Michael Franti. Maher was referencing the Oklahoma police officer Betty Shelby who was charged with manslaughter in the first degree after she shot and killed Crutcher, an unarmed black man. “She shouldn’t have done that,” Maher said, “But I must say she’s a victim of bad police training. Police do not train the way they should. Now, if you’re that nervous, you can’t do this job.” Maher then aired the footage of the shooting in Charlotte, saying: “We don’t know whether he had a gun, but even if he did, you don’t have to kill every time somebody does something that makes you nervous. We have to train our police to not be that guy.” Seeing both sides of the issue, Franti shared his thoughts on the recent racially charged news. He talked about his mixed race family he was adopted into which included a lesbian sister and police officer brother. Lastly, Maher saved his piece de resistance in the New Rules wrap up for Apple’s incessant upgrading of the already does too much iPhone and those who stand in what he called “the nerd line”. If Apple wants to buck the trend, Maher said, try not releasing a new iPhone. “The only people who really need you to get a new phone every year are the shareholders,” he said. Maureen Dowd: Musician Michael Franti talks about the police, racial politics and wearing no shoes for 15 years. New Rules wraps with the iPhone 7 rant. Maher quipped: “Oh, Bill. How can you say the iPhone 7 is the same as the 6? The old phone had an A9 processor and a camera with an aperture of 2.2. And the new one has an A10 and a 1.8. Sorry, not sorry.” Overtime, where Max Brooks scares the shit out of all of us over automated cars and ISIS or Russia hacking them and killing us all. Got something to say about this?

The album is the first to do so, with Drizzy sharing the above photo on Instagram announcing the achievement. Drake now has a one-of-a-kind plaque signed by Apple CEO Tim Cook, who thanks the rapper for driving such traffic to the streaming service. When Views dropped back in April, it was at first an Apple Music and iTunes exclusive, so that it would reach this milestone through the streaming service makes a ton of sense. When Apple Music first launched in June of 2015, the brand signed Drake to an endorsement deal reportedly worth $19 million. In the time since its release, Views has been certified triple platinum by the RIAA, amassing a billion total streams across all platforms back in June. The staggering numbers make such Drake lines as “25 sitting on 25 mill’ seem not only outdated, but pedestrian. When Forbes released their annual list of Hip Hop Cash Kings earlier this month, Drake was behind only Diddy, Jay Z and Dr. Dre, pulling in $38.5 million, and that’s without liquor, streaming or headphone brands to his name. While some, Joe Budden among them, may see Views as an underwhelming artistic effort, it’s impossible to argue against its commercial success, with the album continuing to soar even months after its release. Clap for ’em. Thank you to everyone.

A ‘teardown’ of the components by analysts IHS Markit in the new 32GB iPhone 7 found that the hardware costs £170 – plus £4 manufacturing costs. At the UK price of £599, it means that Apple’s taking home a healthy wedge of money – £425 profit per handset. ‘Costs for the iPhone 7 are more in line with what we have seen in teardowns of recent flagship phones from Apple’s main competitor, Samsung, in that the costs are higher than in previous iPhone teardown analyses,’ said Andrew Rassweiler, senior director of cost benchmarking for IHS Markit. ‘Apple still makes more margin from hardware than Samsung, but materials costs are higher than in the past.’ MORE: Apple’s ‘iBag’ could be the greatest invention of all time (or it’s just a plastic bag) The ‘teardown’ does not take into account costs such as research and development and transport – and Apple has disagreed with such analyses in the past.

Now it looks like it will again be the turn of the green team to provide GPUs for upcoming Apple computers, in the not-too-distant future. Just ahead of the weekend Bloomberg reported that Nvidia had posted job listings indicating some new Apple computers are being readied with, probably, Pascal graphics technology inside. There are three Nvidia job adverts currently live asking for people with the expertise on Macs. Bloomberg says there is one for a Mac software developer, one to join the Nvidia Mac driver development team, and the newest one for a 'METAL compute and OpenCL software engineer – Mac'. This latest advertised role seems quite significant. In the job description Nvidia says the hired candidate will "help produce the next revolutionary Apple products". The engineer will be implementing and extending METAL and OpenCL on the latest Nvidia hardware and Apple OSX software. Furthermore the hired engineer will be "working in partnership with Apple," writing code that "will define and shape the future of METAL and OpenCL" on Macs. As noted by Bloomberg, most Macs rely on Intel integrated graphics, sometimes with build-to-order upgrades available and with higher end machines offering discrete GPU options by default. Between 2013 and its latest set of results Nvidia's reliance on its traditional computer graphics base has dwindled as it pushes into professional visualisation, data centre, and automotive businesses. Nevertheless, it will likely be pleased if it can steal back its Apple Mac business from rival AMD. According to rough calculations by the Motley Fool, winning back the Apple Mac GPU business could net Nvidia approximately $100 million in revenue per annum.

Bits and Chips reports that due to tech stagnation in regards to Intel’s mobility processors, Apple might jump ship over to camp AMD and use their latest Zen based processors to power off the MacBook Pro lineup. Next-Generation Apple MacBook Pro Might Feature a Custom AMD Zen Chip For a long time, Apple MacBook Pro series has been featuring a mix of U and H series processors. Usually, both tiers get their graphics updated with performance enhancements around the same time but with Kaby Lake, the high-performance models might be looking elsewhere for that extra horsepower. The latest Intel mobility processor roadmap shows that after Skylake, Intel would be shifting to a new CPU family known as Kaby Lake. This family will be available in several variants. However, MacBook Pro’s have relied on faster graphics performance and that doesn’t seem to be the case in the upcoming generation of Intel processors. Intel’s 14nm Kaby Lake, Coffee Lake and 10nm Cannonlake CPU roadmap leaks out. (Image Credits: Anandtech Forums) The U-series models in this family are going to be available in Q1 2017 with GT3e graphics. The faster H-series processors will rely on a slower GT2 graphics chip. This problem is with GT2 parts as Apple has a major focus on graphics performance from Integrated GPUs. While 13″ models of the MacBook Pro can utilize the U-series chips, the high-performance aimed, 15″ models will not be a major graphics update if Apple decides to go with new Kaby Lake or even the Coffee Lake parts available in mid 2018. The only high-performance variant that Intel has in their H-series line is based on Skylake and has GT4e graphics. This model is fast but comes at a high cost. The GT3e graphics chips are only offered in sub-45W variants with either Kaby Lake or Coffee Lake chips. It’s possible that Intel could offer enough GPU updates with Kaby Lake that it somewhat matches the GT3e tier level performance but there’s another solution. Advertisement AMD’s Custom Zen Based SOC Could Be A Potential Candidate For Apple MacBook Pro AMD is known to offer custom chips based on their latest Zen architecture in 2018. Apple could go that route if Intel is unable to meet their requirements in the graphics department. AMD can exploit this situation and round up a custom Zen based SOC featuring their latest GCN cores and a couple of HBM (cache/system subsystem) for Apple. Recently leaked details show AMD’s next generation APU solutions with power as low as 10W and base models with 35-45W TDP. That matches Intel’s H-series processors in terms of power consumption and added graphics performance from the GCN cores sounds like a potential candidate for the latest MacBook Pro models. Such a custom chip could be a big win for AMD’s custom-SOC division. By 2018, such a chip would be very feasible to produce in terms of cost and volume as FinFET process would have matured enough and HBM2 yields would be ideal to supply to mass market. Of course, we aren’t setting this in stone as if Apple is indeed going to feature a AMD chip inside their next gen laptop solution. But the possibility of it happening is high given the latest Intel roadmap leak. Intel is known for changing roadmaps from time to time so we might just see them slipping in a GT3 graphics chip under the H-series lineup.

The debate between presidential nominees Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump marks the beginning of the seven week final stretch between the first debate and election day on November 8. There will be three presidential debates in total, and one vice presidential debate. On both App Stores, Apple's "Watch the Debate Live" section contains a few of the same apps. For iOS, top billing goes to major social networks Twitter and Facebook, and then news outlets CBS News and ABC News. Twitter recently launched a live streaming tvOS app, so it's also first on the Apple TV app store, followed by CBS News, ABC News, Washington Post Video, Reuters TV, and more. Watch the Debate Live on iOS: Twitter Facebook CBS News ABC News The Washington Post Reuters TV NBC News CNN Fox News YouTube Univision NOW MSNBC Watch the Debate Live on tvOS: Twitter CBS News ABC News Washington Post Video Reuters TV NBC News Bloomberg TV CNNgo Fox News YouTube For those with a cable subscription, Wired reported that all three upcoming presidential debates will be broadcast simultaneously across most major networks and cable channels: ABC, NBC, Fox, CBS, MSNBC, Fox News, CNN, Univision, and C-SPAN. Earlier in the month, the Commission on Presidential Debates confirmed that both Facebook and Snapchat will be covering each debate to provide content for users of both social networks. Users can comment and ask questions on Facebook Live videos, and follow along to Snapchat's Live Stories "from the different perspectives of students from the debate host universities, volunteers, media and many others." Although not included in Apple's collection of apps, other streamable services will support debate coverage, including: BuzzFeed News, Hulu, PBS, Yahoo, and more.

Ross Perot handed the 1992 election to Bill Clinton because he was running on the right. He stole votes exclusively from Bush Senior. Ralph Nader similarly handed the 2000 election to Bush Junior because he was running on the left, exclusively stealing votes from Al Gore. Gary Johnson is running down the middle, stealing votes equally from both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. He easily leads with independent voters (AKA, swing voters, the people who decide elections), voters under the age of 30, and veterans. If you want to vote for him, but are afraid you'd be handing the election to <insert name of candidate you hate most>, go to http://balancedrebellion.com/ - They'll match you up with someone who hates <your lesser of two evils> from the same state you live in. Both of you then pledge to vote for the candidate you most like, knowing that you haven't handed the election to anyone, because you nullified a vote for that person. #2 - Gary Johnson doesn't have to sweep the map. If he wins a single state, it becomes difficult for either of the other candidate to reach 270 electoral votes. In that case, Congress determines who wins the election. Republicans control both houses by a small majority, but many have already said they back Johnson, not Trump. Thus the anti-Trump Republicans can cooperate with Democrats (who unanimously despise Trump) to hand the presidency to Johnson. #3 - The presidential debates are controlled by a board of 3 Republicans and 3 Democrats. They set arbitrary rules for what it takes to be in the debates. In 1992, they said you only needed to have 5% support in national polls to be in the debate. Ross Perot had 6% so qualified. By the time of the election, he won with 19%, largely because the extra exposure from the debates gave him a huge boost in those final 2 months. This year, Johnson has 13% support before the debates. So the threshold was arbitrarily moved up to 15% to exclude him. Had he been in the debates and received a boost similar to Perot's, it's reasonable to think his support would have gone to between 26% and 40%, potentially giving him the plurality.

As much as I love your rhetoric, Gary Johnson just hasn't garnered enough popularity nationwide to appeal to the masses. I wish that wasn't the case but it is wishful thinking at this point.

There are no real candidates there, and it's all scripted and controlled anyway. What a joke. [doublepost=1474916959][/doublepost] As much as I love your rhetoric, Gary Johnson just hasn't garnered enough popularity nationwide to appeal to the masses. I wish that wasn't the case but it is wishful thinking at this point. Better for us to realize our collective errors and focus on the next election. Actually, go check out Congressional Dish podcast... the episode on Electoral College. If Johnson won even a couple of tiny state, it would throw the election to a decision in Congress. That would create an interesting situation, for sure. BTW, we should probably focus more on Congress, and be sure to check out that podcast anyway, as it's packed with info on what Congress is up to (the good, but mostly the bad and ugly).

The SandJacking attack uses a flaw in XCode 7 regarding certificates. How does the attack exploit this flaw, and how dangerous is SandJacking compared to other iOS threats? To keep its ecosystem malware free, Apple requires all apps to be distributed via its official App Store. Each app is reviewed to ensure it is reliable, performs as expected and is free of offensive or malicious features; it also runs in a sandbox to prevent other processes from accessing it and its associated data. Each app has to be signed with an Apple Developer ID certificate. These are only available to members of Apple's Developer Program, who have to go through a verification process, which can include having to provide government-issued photo identification like a driver's license or passport. On the whole, these security controls work very well, though there have been some notable cases where malware has still managed to infect numerous iOS devices: WireLurker, XcodeGhost and AceDeceiver. SandJacking is now another example. Before the release of iOS 8.3, one attack technique was to replace a legitimate app with a rogue version by simply assigning the malicious app a similar identifier, known as a bundle ID, and overwriting the original application. IOS 8.3 now prevents the installation of an app that has an ID similar to an existing one. However, while this check prevents a legitimate app from being overwritten and replaced during the installation process, it doesn't provide any safeguard during the restore process. Chilik Tamir from Mi3 Security recently demonstrated how an attacker with physical access to an unlocked iPhone can create a backup, remove the legitimate app, install his rogue version of the deleted app and then restore the backup. This SandJacking attack works on non-jailbroken iPhones and gives the attacker access to the sandbox data of the app it replaces. The malicious app still has to be signed, but in Xcode version 7 -- a suite of software development tools created by Apple -- programmers are allowed to create iOS apps using unvalidated certificates that can be obtained by simply providing an Apple ID and then distributing them directly, avoiding Apple's application review and store restrictions. Creating an Apple ID is a simple process requiring only a name and an email address. Although apps created with these unvalidated certificates have limited capabilities compared to regular apps where the developer has been through the formal verification process to obtain a certificate -- they can't access Apple Pay or in-app purchase features for example -- they can still access personal data such as the victim's address book and calendar. They're also likely to go undetected by the user, who would have to check the app's certificate and the device's provisioning settings to verify the developer's identity. The SandJacking attack itself is not as dangerous a threat as other iOS threats, such as YiSpecter, XcodeGhost and Backdoor.MAC.Eleanor, which offer the attacker full control of the compromised device, because the attacker would need physical access to the device to pull a SandJacking attack off. It could be used while a phone is being repaired, or by a family member or law enforcement agency who has access to the device. But any type of smartphone that is unlocked and in the possession of someone other than the owner has to be regarded as potentially compromised. What the attack shows is how reliant the internet and technology as a whole is becoming on digital certificates when deciding whether something or someone should be trusted or not. Those who issue digital certificates need to ensure the internet and security systems can actually trust them.

Some of these plans are now actively being developed, according to Bloomberg. Firstly, Apple is working on new sleep tracking and fitness apps for Apple Watch that take advantage of the heart rate sensor for insight. Apple is yet to offer sleep analysis of any kind in its wearable and its current Heart Rate app in watchOS 3 is very limited. The report says the new heart rate app will be more advanced, measuring a person’s fitness by observing the amount of time it takes for a heartbeat to fall from a peak to resting rate. The company is also apparently exploring ways to dramatically expand the functionality of HealthKit and the Health app … The Bloomberg report does not give a timeframe for the release of these new features for Apple Watch. watchOS 3.1 is currently in beta for developers but has almost no new user-facing features in the current seed. The apps may not debut until new hardware is released as current Apple Watch battery life makes sleep tracking inconvenient; with battery life that approximately lasts one day, Apple currently recommends charging the device at night time. Of course, Apple could release the apps sooner and simply suggest to charge the device at a different time of day … although this is more inconvenient for most people. Looking further, the report says Apple wants to expand HealthKit service from a simple repository of user health data into a “tool that improves diagnoses” from doctors. Details on how this would work is scarce but it likely includes a centralized platform so that doctors and medical professionals can access all the relevant data regardless of their location or the proprietary databasing system of the hospital. Apple could also exploit the powerful processing inside its devices to automatically find anomalies or patterns in the HealthKit database and present that to users. Right now, the Health app in iOS merely shows the statistics it has collected and does not try to interpret the readings at all. Earlier in the year, Apple acquired Gliimpse. The company was aiming to create a universal health records system that would be compatible with all systems across the industry. This certainly lines up with the reported aims for HealthKit in the future. Notably, Apple also recently hired a YouTube personality who specialized in making medical how-to videos. In terms of hardware, before Apple Watch debuted in 2014, there were a lot of rumors about the wearable including a multitude of health sensors that could track things like blood glucose or blood oxygen. The Watch shipped with ‘just’ a heart rate sensor and an accelerometer. Similarly, Apple Watch Series 2 added no new sensors. The Bloomberg report shines some light on this and suggests not to expect much change on this front. Adding new medical sensors would also likely require approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, a much higher bar for Apple to cross. “If they are going to an FDA device, it would need to have enough battery life to last a day, and something where it independently functions from your phone,” said Yuri Teshler, a health-care consultant at Moor Insights & Strategy. Apple can’t really do anything more with health-related sensors until the watch has a wireless LTE chip and the independent cellular connection that comes with that, he added. Apple has so far struggled to do that. The report says adding things like a glucometer would necessitate approval by the FDA standards bodies. It also says that the data is not really required as the accelerometer alone can provide a lot of information by itself, at least for fitness-oriented analysis.

News Stocks Technology Science Tech Space Human Earth Health Politics World Videos The Tape Latest Follow WSP Newsletter RSS Facebook Twitter Google+ Search for: HomeConsumerApple (AAPL) Could Be Just Months Away From a New Product Release Apple (AAPL) Could Be Just Months Away From a New Product Release According to a recent FCC filing, Apple plans to release a new device. Could it be the rumored 5th generation of the Apple TV? September 26, 2016 WSP It has been less than a month since Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) debuted the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. And while Apple’s major yearly event is over, that doesn’t mean no more surprises for the reminder of the year from Cupertino. In fact, Apple diehards are now anticipating another product release from the tech giant. Rumors suggest that the next Apple TV – the 5th-gen Apple TV, and a new line of Mac computers could be launched during the latter months of 2016 or into the first quarter of 2017. Always on the lookout for interesting news, media outlets through their various sources often provide strong clues as to what tech companies are up to. One such source is the United States’ official certification authority, the FCC since limited but still valuable information about upcoming gadgets and devices can be found on their website. On September 20, a new unknown Apple product was published via FCC. The file for the product was proposed to the agency on September 13 which was just six days after the iPhone 7 was launched. The new document indicates that the device has been approved for sale in the US. Apple has not yet made any announcements regarding a new product and there were no clear details as to what it is. But if we have to guess, the unknown Apple device, which bears the model number A1844, has case dimensions that are similar to the 4th generation Apple TV which comes equipped with the Siri voice remote. Its screw positioning is also the same as the said product with two Torx screws. The small size and curves on the device have a connector with four colored cables. The A1844 model number found on the case is not currently being used by Apple for any of their existing products, which means it is definitely a new one. The FCC filing shows that tests were conducted on the device showing Bluetooth low energy chip. It also has a Near-field communication (NFC) module. NFC is not available in the existing Apple TV versions. It is however, present on the iPhone and Apple Watch as part of the Apple Pay service. NFC is used mainly for contactless payments. However, the document does not show any data about tests using Wi-Fi. This could mean that Apple decided to re-use the same hardware design or there is no Wi-Fi functionality at all. Consomac first published the find of the FCC approved documents. According to the French website, there were no pictures to show what the unit would look like. The details were also not enough to draw a concrete conclusion in terms of of what exactly it can be used for. There are speculations that the changes in the hardware might not be that big. But, the power specifications of the product are very different from the existing model. The power draw for the new Apple device is shown to be 100mA with a top capacity of 700mA, and between 5.5V and 13.2V. The 4th generation Apple TV had a power supply that had a top capacity of 920mA and 12V.

 Why it's so hard to find a jet-black iPhone 7 Kif Leswing Sep. 26, 2016, 8:43 AM 20,890 facebook linkedin twitter email print Hollis Johnson/Business Insider One color of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus is really hard to find: jet black.  If you order an iPhone 7 Plus in the shiny, scratchable finish from Apple today, it won't be delivered until November.  One main reason for the shortage is that Apple is having trouble with jet-black case production, according to a research note from KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo obtained by Business Insider.  The jet-black iPhone 7 model "suffers from a low casing production yield rate of 60-70%," writes Kuo. That means that Apple's partners, when producing the new finish, are producing a substantial number of cases that don't meet quality standards.  That's leading to an "undersupply," according to Kuo.  Also contributing to the problem is that "jet-black is the most popular choice," according to a pre-order survey conducted by KGI Securities. Jet-black iPhones accounted for 30-35% of pre-orders worldwide, and nearly half of pre-orders in China, the survey suggests.  "The survey offers an insight into iPhone buyers’ tendency to choose models that are aesthetically different from the 6S. Popularity of the jet-black version indicates that consumers prefer an alternative to the traditional metal finish," Kuo writes. Ultimately 50% of pre-orderers opted for the iPhone 7 Plus as compared to the smaller model, the survey suggests. Still, even with the increased demand for jet-black iPhones, Kuo thinks that the iPhone 7 will sell fewer units in 2016 than the iPhone 6S did in 2015. The initial iPhone 7 shortage was not entirely due to demand, instead, it was constrained by supply. The device launched in 28 countries simultaneously, as compared to 12 last year.  "We maintain our forecast that iPhone 7 shipment volume in 2016 will be lower than that for the iPhone 6S in 2015," Kuo writes. However, Kuo advises that KGI Securities has raised its estimate for unit sales of the iPhone 7 from 65 million to between 70 million and 75 million.  SEE ALSO: THE BUSINESS INSIDER iPHONE 7 REVIEW NOW WATCH: Apple revealed why some iPhones are randomly shutting down despite having battery life left Loading video...

Follow TechnoBuffalo Strong demand for the iPhone 7 Plus still isn’t enough to turn around a decline in iPhone sales, according to one reliable analyst. Apple’s latest device may not even outsell the iPhone 6s, which was responsible for the company’s first decline in revenue in 13 years. It seems as though there is incredibly strong demand for Apple’s latest device, what with most models — especially the Plus-sized options and those coated in jet black — proving difficult to get hold of during the launch period. It’s thought sales have also been boosted slightly by Samsung’s worldwide Galaxy Note 7 recall, which meant the South Korean company’s newest phablet was impossible to obtain for over a month. But we shouldn’t read too much into all this. According to reliable KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple is still going to suffer a year-over-year decline in iPhone shipments for 2016. He expects the shipment volume to be lower than that for iPhone 6s in 2015. The new jet black color option has helped boost iPhone demand somewhat, accounting for around 30 to 35 percent of pre-orders worldwide. In China, it has accounted for 45 to 50 percent. However, Apple is unable to manufacture this model as quickly as the others. “The initial iPhone 7 supply shortage was due to better-than-expected demand for the iPhone 7 Plus and undersupply of jet black casings caused by a poor production yield rate of 60-70%,” writes Kuo in his report. “Overall demand is still weaker than that for the iPhone 6s.” This news won’t please Apple investors, who have been waiting for the company to deliver something big that can turn iPhone sales around. However, we all expected this year’s refresh to be a relatively small one, while next year’s is likely to be a lot more significant.

On Saturday, Apple fans in Sante Fe Mexico finally got to join in on all the fun that other fans around the world have known for years: getting their hands on a new iPhone model first. Crowds of customers began lining up overnight for the grand opening of Apple Vía Santa Fe, the first Apple Store in Mexico. Below are some of the photos of opening day.   Big Mouth Bill Maher   While Apple fans have been enjoying the annual iPhone event, conceited big mouth Bill Maher decided to bash Apple and their fans on Friday night. I guess Mr. cranky didn't get his free iPhone 7 this year   Maher noted that "If Apple wants to live up to its motto of 'think different,' perhaps it should try not releasing a new phone for a change. The only people who really need you to get a new phone are the shareholders. But just because investors want Apple's stock price to rise doesn't mean you need to stand in that nerd line and buy it."   Then again, what do you expect from a Hillary Clinton fan? We reported back in June that Nancy Pelosi took a shot at Apple's Tim Cook and Elizabeth Warren accused Apple of trying to snuff out competition. In that same month we reported that Nancy Pelosi took a shot at the late CEO Steve Jobs. We noted in our report that "At a Democratic Platform Drafting Committee hearing on Thursday, Pelosi pulled out what seemed to be an iPhone 6S Plus and said the smartphone was built through federal research, not by Apple's or Steve Jobs' ingenuity."   With that said, it's great to see Apple fans in Mexico get their first store that's long overdue.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Apparently Apple had omitted certain features in iOS 10’s backup that they included in iOS 9 that made it less susceptible to brute force attacks, and as it turns out, it was an oversight on Apple’s part. In a statement an Apple’s spokesperson made to Forbes, “We’re aware of an issue that affects the encryption strength for backups of devices on iOS 10 when backing up to iTunes on the Mac or PC. We are addressing this issue in an upcoming security update. This does not affect iCloud backups.” In the meantime, they also advised users to ensure that their Macs and PCs were protected by strong passwords. “We recommend users ensure their Mac or PC are protected with strong passwords and can only be accessed by authorized users. Additional security is also available with FileVault whole disk encryption.” However we should point out that according to the researchers who discovered the flaw, this hack would only work if the hacker had physical access to your device, meaning that the chances of your iOS backup being compromised is pretty low, unless you’re being targeted specifically, but either way we guess we’ll have to wait for the fix to be released.

But if fall weather awakens a craving in you for that earthy flavor nuts provide, try a dessert that uses them as a core component, like a honey-vanilla almond cake or wild hickory nut shortbread cookies. Here are 18 recipes to whet your appetite. Snowball Cookies [Photograph: Vicky Wasik] The nutty flavor and almost sandy texture in these crisp-tender Christmas cookies come from ground toasted nuts—almonds are traditional, but other nuts work, too. It's not a snowball cookie without a generous dusting of powdered sugar, and we've found that the key to an even coating is to roll the cookies in sugar twice, so the first layer melts into a glaze that helps the second coat stick. Get the recipe for Snowball Cookies » Crispy Citrus-Candied Pistachios [Photograph: Vicky Wasik] The Fresh Lemon Syrup devised by Stella is a terrific start to an extra-lemony lemonade, but there are a million other uses for it—for example, coating these lightly citrusy candied pistachios. Because the syrup is mostly sugar, the nuts take on a satisfyingly crispy shell when toasted. A layer of powdered sugar applied after toasting keeps them from clumping. Eat the pistachios on their own as a snack, or use them as a pretty garnish for fruit desserts. Get the recipe for Crispy Citrus-Candied Pistachios » Moist and Chewy Lebkuchen (German Spiced Christmas Cookies) [Photograph: Vicky Wasik] If you prefer the warm, spicy flavor of gingerbread cookies to their crispy texture, you've got to try German lebkuchen, which pack similar flavors into moist, chewy bars. The dough here is made with ground hazelnuts and almond meal, sweetened with honey and brown sugar, and spiced with cinnamon, cloves, allspice, crystallized ginger, and more. A pure white glaze spiked with kirsch tops the bars off.

Whether you're celebrating the festival or not, with a little effort (okay, a lot), you can make your own mooncakes at home that are leagues better than anything you can find in a store. These round, deep-golden cakes are stuffed with spiced walnuts and sweet red bean paste, then coated with an egg wash that leaves them with a shiny glaze. Get the recipe for Sweet Mooncakes With Spiced Walnut and Red Bean Filling » Chocolate-Coated Caramel Honeycomb With Salted Peanuts [Photograph: Nila Jones] The name is a bit misleading, since the recipe doesn't include any actual honeycomb. Instead, it's a reference to consistency and appearance: When you combine caramel with baking soda, it bubbles up to form an aerated, light golden candy that looks a bit like honeycomb. Once it sets, pour on melted chocolate, sprinkle on crunchy peanuts, and break off a piece as you would with peanut brittle. It takes just half an hour to make, but looks way more impressive than that. Get the recipe for Chocolate-Coated Caramel Honeycomb With Salted Peanuts » Easy, Light, and Tender Honey-Vanilla Almond Cake [Photograph: Jennifer Latham] Almond flour furnishes the nutty flavor in this surprisingly fluffy gluten-free cake—you can buy the flour, of course, but grinding your own at home yields the best results. The key to the cake's lightness is whipping room-temperature egg whites with just a couple of drops of lemon juice, creating a stable foam to keep the cake airy even after baking. Get the recipe for Easy, Light, and Tender Honey-Vanilla Almond Cake » French Madeleines With Almonds and Apricot Glaze [Photograph: Nila Jones] They do require a special pan, but beyond that, there's not much to making these fancy-looking madeleines. Brown butter and almond extract flavor the simple batter, which whips up easily without aid from an electric mixer. Before baking them, we top the madeleines with shaved almonds; afterward, they're coated with a fruity apricot glaze. Get the recipe for French Madeleines With Almonds and Apricot Glaze » The Best Apple Crisp [Photograph: Vicky Wasik] The combination of soft, sweet fruit and crunchy crumb is what makes apple crisp so good, though, to be honest, the latter has always been my favorite part. This recipe focuses most of your effort on building a crumb of contrasting flavors and textures, using good butter, raw sugar for its molasses-like flavor, lemon zest, nutmeg, salt, and nuts. Pecans are our nut of choice for crisp toppings, and don't forget to toast them. Get the recipe for The Best Apple Crisp » Easy Stovetop Fruit Crisp [Photograph: Yvonne Ruperti] Fruit crisps work just as well on the stovetop as they do in the oven, though the process is slightly different. Rather than layer everything together before cooking, you'll prepare the fruit and topping separately, and toast the streusel to give it a crunchy consistency. We used hazelnuts in the topping here, but pecans, almonds, or walnuts will do fine; apples, pears, apricots, and peaches can all substitute for the red plums we call for. Get the recipe for Easy Stovetop Fruit Crisp » Fresh Fig and Hazelnut Tart [Photograph: Lauren Weisenthal] The fresh figs dotting the surface of this elegant tart give it an especially dramatic appearance. To make it, we spread the figs out on a pâte sucrée crust, along with a chewy hazelnut filling. The high heat of the oven caramelizes the tops of the split figs, giving them a mellow, honeyed flavor. For additional nutty flavor, add a little Frangelico to the filling. Get the recipe for Fresh Fig and Hazelnut Tart » Maple Walnut Biscotti [Photograph: Lauren Weisenthal] The word biscotti means "twice-cooked," and that's the technique that gives these cookies their signature crunch. You'll bake the dough into one long loaf first, then cut it up and bake the slices again until they're crisp, ready for dunking into coffee. Walnuts are a traditional ingredient in biscotti, and maple syrup...well, isn't, but we love its deep, earthy sweetness. Get the recipe for Maple Walnut Biscotti » Apple-Pecan Bourbon-Caramel Pie [Photograph: Jennifer Latham] For those who can't choose between apple pie and pecan pie, this hybrid dessert gives you the best of two wonderful worlds, with the sweet, corn-syrupy pecan layer complementing the tart and fruity apples. But just because it's a double pie doesn't mean it's double the work: Simply blind-bake the crust, then pour in the cooked apples and bourbon-pecan caramel, let cool, and serve. Get the recipe for Apple-Pecan Bourbon-Caramel Pie » Wild Hickory Nut Shortbread Cookies [Photograph: Yossy Arefi] Wild nuts can be incredibly flavorful, and wild shagbark hickory nuts are particularly buttery and sweet, even when raw. If you can find them, you'll want to show them off, and these simple shortbread cookies let the nuts stand out. Not planning on doing any foraging this fall? Store-bought pecans won't have the same effect, but they'll still make a nice cookie. Get the recipe for Wild Hickory Nut Shortbread Cookies » No-Bake Super-Chewy Chocolate Chip Peanut Butter Oat Bars [Photograph: Yvonne Ruperti] Oatmeal bars are a satisfying and conveniently portable snack that's far better made at home. Ours combine rich, nutty peanut butter and crunchy chopped peanuts to make a bar that feels like dessert, but isn't too sweet. The chewy texture—which, in our experience, is the trickiest part of homemade oat bars to get right—is helped along by melted marshmallows. Get the recipe for No-Bake Super-Chewy Chocolate Chip Peanut Butter Oat Bars » Texas Sheet Cake [Photograph: Carrie Vasios Mullins] Recipes for this old-school dessert vary, but it generally consists of a thin chocolate buttermilk cake, a layer of chocolate icing (you can make it thicker if you're an icing fanatic, like I am), and toasted pecans. Buttermilk in both the cake and the icing provides a little tangy balance, keeping the dessert from getting cloyingly sweet. Get the recipe for Texas Sheet Cake » Maple Walnut Ice Cream [Photograph: Vicky Wasik] Nuts' role in ice cream doesn't have to be limited to a mix-in. This maple walnut ice cream is nutty in its own right, because we steep chopped walnuts into the base before churning. Since those nuts will lose their flavor and texture, use freshly chopped ones to mix into the ice cream for texture. Get the recipe for Maple Walnut Ice Cream » Browned Butter Pecan Ice Cream [Photograph: Vicky Wasik] It's one of the many sad truths of supermarket ice cream: Most commercial butter pecan varieties don't really taste like butter or pecans. Steeping pecans in the base, as with the above maple walnut recipe, and browning the butter before incorporating give this ice cream a heavy dose of both flavors. We sweeten it with raw sugar for a little extra depth. Get the recipe for Browned Butter Pecan Ice Cream » Peanut and Coke Sorbet [Photograph: Max Falkowitz] Because it's got so much fat and protein, peanut butter is one of our favorite choices for adding body to a dairy-free ice cream. Here, we put it to work in a sorbet inspired by the classic (but disappearing) Southern combination of salted peanuts and Coca-Cola. The peanut butter leaves the ice cream abundantly smooth and creamy, allowing you to cut out the real cream entirely and let the flavors of peanuts and Coke predominate.

By Sarmistha Acharya September 26, 2016 12:37 BST Sales of the iPhone 7 might not be as good as compared to the iPhone 6sGetty Images Apple is expected to do well as far as sales of its latest iPhone 7 and its large-screen variant 7 Plus is concerned, by the end of the year. However, the figures might not exceed what the iPhone 6s achieved in 2015, an analyst has said. In the latest research note provided by KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has said that Apple is expected to ship about 70 to 75 million new iPhone models by the year-end, contrary to the original estimation of 65 million units. The surge in sales figures is basically due to the recall of the Galaxy Note 7. Samsung recalled about 2.5 million Note 7 units in 10 countries including China, South Korea, US, UK and Australia after reports of devices exploding while charging surfaced. The company is currently working on replacing the faulty Note 7 units with new ones, after which it wants to resume sales in different markets. Another reason behind the additional sales is due to the dual-camera feature introduced in the iPhone 7 Plus, the KGI research note said, a copy of which was obtained by Apple Insider. The dual 12 megapixels cameras on the 7 Plus, as Apple explains, work together to offer twice the optical zoom and up to 10x digital zoom for photos. Nonetheless, Kuo believes that mobile network operators' report about sell-out and strong consumer demand for the device is "not entirely due to the market demand". The initial stock of iPhone 7 Plus was sold out globally even before Apple could roll out the device in the market. Supply of the iPhone 7 Plus in all colour variants were exhausted and the new jet black colour variant of the iPhone 7 was sold out. T-Mobile's chief executive officer John Legere had declared the demand for iPhone 7 was "phenomenal" and pre-orders were "like four times bigger than iPhone 6". Kuo further pointed out that the low yields of the jet black variant was another reason for low stock of the iPhone 7 Plus. Contrary to Kuo's prediction, Hi Investment & Securities analyst Song Eun-jeong earlier said Apple can lead the premium smartphone market with due credit to carrier promotions. IBK Investment & Securities analyst Lee Seung-woo had earlier said that the South Korean suppliers had orders for components to build 80 to 85 million iPhone 7 units before its launch, pushing the total quantity to more than 100 million phones before the year-end.

And like the latest instalment a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, the iPhone 7 is a mix of good old-fashioned nostalgia and new tricks. But is it any good? MORE: Apple’s iPhone 7 Plus has already sold out With Apple’s main rival Samsung exploding as catastrophically as either Death Star, will the iPhone 7 swoop in like Han Solo on the Millennium Falcon to save the day, or will it end up choking on its own hubris like Jabba the Hutt? Let’s find out. Here are the seven things you need to know about the new iPhone. 1. It looks the same… but different Does it come in black? Uh… yeah (Picture: Apple) Humans are a superficial bunch. Most people’s first reaction when holding an iPhone 7 is this: ‘It looks just like the 6s.’ But while the front of the 7 does emulate its predecessor, turn the thing over and there are some subtle differences. The camera lens is bigger, for one, while the antenna bands no longer run across the back of the device. It all makes for a much cleaner look. As with every iPhone, there’s a big debate about colour. This one comes in five – the usual silver, gold and rose gold – and two new blacks, matte and jet. Which black you prefer will probably depend on your favourite Batmobile. If it’s Michael Keaton’s, you’re going to want jet black, but watch out for scratches and fingerprints. If you love Christian Bale’s Tumbler, you’re going to go for the matte. It’s the one I’ve been using, and while less flash, its sleekness is a grower. 2. It will make a real splash Finally, you can dip your iPhone in a paddling pool. The latest version is IP67 water resistant (no, I don’t really know what that means, either), which should ensure your phone is safe from the odd inadvertent drop in a sink, or, you know, down the loo. 3. Go big or go home The home button has been given a revamp (Picture: Apple) There has been a lot of consternation about the new iPhone’s home button, which has gone all haptic in a departure from the previous incarnations and their solid click. Even if you’re well versed in the language of 3D Touch on the 6s, the new home button is a little bit jarring, although there are three pressure sensitivities to choose from. You’re either going to love it or you’re going to hate it. If it’s the latter, just wait until the iPhone 8 lands next year – rumour has it that device will dispense with the home button entirely. What you will love is the subtle Taptic feedback you get from typing and scrolling your way around the phone, making every thumb press feel substantial. 4. These go to 11… Make some noise (Picture: Apple) Warning: Those kids at the back of the bus blasting their music from their smartphones just got a hell of a lot louder. The iPhone 7 is, quite remarkably, the first iPhone to come with stereo speakers, and if you find yourself at a party and the host’s Sonos system crashes, you have a pretty decent replacement, even if the technology behind the new speaker grille has been questioned. MORE: New iPhone doesn’t actually have a speaker behind the speaker grille I pitted the speakers on the 6s against those on the 7 with a comparative test of I Disappear by Metallica (other thrash metal bands are available); one sounded like listening to a song on an old AM radio station… in the house next door – the other made me question whether or not Metallica had actually landed in my front room. 5. Hit the road, jack Apple’s latest EarPods have a lightning jack (Picture: AP) Apple has made the iPhone louder, then, but that hasn’t drowned out the noise of millions of voices suddenly crying out in terror. The most controversial aspect of the iPhone 7 is its ditching of the headphone jack. But if you’re not a stickler for a pristine, noise-cancelling aural experience, then there’s little to fret about – the phone comes with the usual EarPods, this time connectable through the lightning jack. Apple has also packaged the iPhone 7 with a headphone jack adapter, so you can use your existing headphones. However, if you’re one of the many people who want to listen to music and charge the phone at the same time, you have to get another adapter. It’s all a little bit complicated. Apple’s lightning to headphone jack adapter (Picture: AP) While it’s clear Apple wants to break away into the new wireless age – its own Bluetooth AirPods are available in late October, for an ear-watering £159 – it’s doing so in a needlessly protracted way, kind of like breaking up with someone… then asking them out to coffee the next day. The AirPods are coming next month (Picture: Apple) Apple insists it’s about give and take, saying the space vacated by the headphone jack has been filled by a better battery, increased water resistance, a haptic home button and a bigger speaker grille, and overall, it may end up being a trade worth making. 6. Low lights, camera, action Inside the iPhone camera (Picture: Apple) The iPhone has turned us into a planet of photographers, but even it couldn’t always successfully fend off the amateur snapper’s greatest nemesis; increasing darkness. Until now. The iPhone 7 gives low lighting a meaty kick in the face, thanks to a system of optical image stabilisation (OIS). You can ignore the mumbo jumbo – what it means is that the phone has the capability to counteract your jerky hand movements when taking a pic in semi-darkness. The results are brighter than any low light photos you might have captured on the 6s. The camera on the iPhone 7 Plus is even crisper, mainly because there’s two, which combine to create an optical zoom that pretty much turns the user into a seasoned paparazzo. 7. The News At iOS 10 Messages has turned into emoji heaven (Picture: Apple) The first thing you will notice about iOS 10, the major software release to coincide with the iPhone 7, is that the device now has a mind of its own – it keeps turning itself on for no reason. Don’t worry, you’re not seeing things, just using a phone that has the Raise to Wake function enabled. It works in the same way as an Apple Watch springs into life when its wearer moves their wrist, and you will either love it or throw your phone against a brick wall. Please, don’t do that; just go into Display & Brightness in Settings and turn the sucker off. Something you may want to seek out rather than switch off is Bedtime, a new tab in Clock which helps you regulate your sleep. Music lovers who are unhappy about the loss of the headphone jack are unlikely to be ecstatic at the new Control Centre (accessed by swiping up from the home button) in iOS 10 – the music control is now on a second page. That extra swipe will rile some users. A more welcome change to the Control Centre is the ability to choose between three different brightness settings for the phone’s torch, meaning the days of blinding all your friends during camping trips are over. But the most notable change with iOS 10 is in Messages, where things have gone a little bit crazy. Why not send someone some balloons? (Picture: Apple) If you got over gifs, emojis and stickers shortly after your 15th birthday, then look away now. Yes, sending a ‘handwritten’ or ‘invisible’ text or an exploding firework graphic to someone is undeniably silly, but it’s also super fun. And what’s the point of paying a huge chunk of change (£599 for the minimum 32GB storage model) for something if it doesn’t bring a smile to your face every once in a while? Verdict Apple just cannot make phones that don’t achieve some kind of greatness, and the iPhone 7 is no exception. It is a great phone, but one with the tough task of surpassing all that has gone before it while satisfying outlandish expectations that were always going to sit more suitably on the phone that follows. In the end, it’s an improvement on the 6s, but not a vast one. There are a few new bells and enough whistles to keep you entertained, and the Instagram generation will be purring over the new camera, but the iPhone 7 doesn’t feel like a substantial leap forward from its predecessor. If you already have the 6s, it’s perhaps not the iPhone you’re looking for, and it might be better to wait and see what Apple delivers this time next year. The iPhone 7 is more of A New Hope then, meaning we’ll have to wait until the iPhone 8 for Apple’s Empire Strikes Back.

Home Business Software Chips Mobile Internet Security Review Desktop Software Graphics cards Laptops Mobile apps Mobiles Peripherals Storage Tablets Workstations TechEye Home Business Software Chips Mobile Internet Security Review Desktop Software Graphics cards Laptops Mobile apps Mobiles Peripherals Storage Tablets Workstations Menu Stronger than expected iPhone 7 sales not enough Posted on September 26, 2016 by Nick Farrell - Business, Mobile Despite Apple managing stronger than expected sales of its iPhone 7 plus, it is not enough to offset a huge decline in iPhone sales, according to one telco bean-counter. The Tame Apple Press is full of news about how Apple’s iPhone 7 is a sell out, pretty much like it normally is at this time of year. This has meant that Apple shares have gone up as investors think the outfit is going to see its cash cow mooing for another year. But KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said that the prophesied slump in iPhone sales is coming, and there is no stopping it. While he has indeed improved his estimates of the total sales for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, overall he predicts that the numbers will be lower than the iPhone 6s. The analyst is basically saying that Apple has a lot to thank Samsung for. The recent fiasco surrounding exploding Galaxy Note 7’s has helped increase confidence, outlook, and sales of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus.He said that earlier reports of supply shortage for the iPhone 7 isn’t exactly because strong demand, believes Kuo. He said that the Jet Black color which is in high demand as well is actually harder to make. He still thinks that the production yield is estimated to be 60-70%. While KGI raised its iPhone 7 shipment forecast from 60-65 million to 70-75 million, the numbers steal look bleak for this year’s generation as a whole, falling below that of the iPhone 6s. Even Apple itself has already predicted this, though it will naturally not share solid numbers.

As per the new rumour, Samsung Galaxy Note 7 and Apple iPhone 7 could be launched in India on Oct.7 Rahul R September 26, 2016 16:50 IST The logo of Samsung Electronics is seen at its headquarters in Seoul. [Representational Image]REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji/File Photo As per a new rumour, Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 and Apple's newest iPhone 7 could be launched in India on the same day on Oct.7. At this point in time, it is worth noting that Samsung will resume sales of the Galaxy Note 7 from Sept.28 and newer units of the smartphone with corrected batteries are expected to be offered. Now, as per a report in The Mobile Indian, there is a strong possibility of Samsung and Apple releasing their two important flagships on the same day by keeping in mind the practicalities of the release schedule in India. However, these developments are yet to go official and remain only as rumours at this point in time. Therefore, both Samsung and Apple loyalists are advised to take these developments with a pinch of salt till there is an official confirmation from both the companies. Nonetheless, what is official at this point in time are the details related to the key technical specifications of both the smartphones. Even the pricing details of the high-end handsets are yet to be officially announced. Samsung offers full refund to Galaxy S7 Edge customers after phone blast A Facebook post by the customer, Weng Briones, now going viral states that Samsung obliged him and issued a full refund on his Galaxy S7 Edge that reportedly exploded on its own without any external influences/trigger. Weng has also praised the after-sales service of Samsung.

Speaking at a jobs announcement by US company WP Engine, who announced 100 online technological jobs in his native Limerick, Mr Noonan said Brussels could not pressurise Ireland into changing any of its tax rates. "We're under no pressure. The European Commission acknowledge the right to set tax rates is a matter for sovereign governments. It's not a competence of Europe or the European Commission, so there's no pressure (from Europe) on us." "It has been part of the Irish offering now for years; we could nearly put it on the (tricolour) now, because everybody knows internationally that the rate is 12.5%. Actually, when industrialists think of Ireland, they automatically think of 12.5%. But, just in case there is any doubt about it, I'll confirm it again in this year's Budget." Earlier, addressing the CEO of Texas-based WP Engine, minister Noonan said: "The recent decision on Apple has had no effect on foreign direct investment in this country, but more importantly, there isn't any pressure from Europe for us to change our tax offering in any way whatsoever. They regard what happened (with Apple) as historic legacy issue from the past, they know we we made changes already, there's no pressure on us to change the 12.5% rate, or indeed to alter any of the other incentives that we have." Mr Noonan said the priority for the government was to ensure further job growth. "From an economic and social point of view the policy has to be to get the maximum number of people working. The nature of jobs are changing, jobs are more highly skilled than they used to be." The Limerick TD said the best measure of prosperity for any country was how any people were employed there. "By that standard we are doing quiet well at present. About 56,000 additionally are at work in Ireland in the last 12 months. For the first time for a long time the number at work has exceeded two million." "That's more than double what it was in the 1980s. At the top of the Celtic Tiger (employment) was about 100,000 more than what it is now, but the Celtic Tiger was a false economy, built on cheap money and on one sector, building and development and so on. What's happening now is that the economy is growing across all sectors," he added. Brexit Mr Noonan said Brexit could positively effect the Irish economy, despite perceptions it will damage the export sector, especially the Irish beef export industry. "I was in London last week for three days. There's a lot of concern in the city of London, and there is a great interest in Ireland as a location for the financial services industry, that may be disrupted by Brexit from the city," Mr Noonan said. "So, that's another job for the IDA to make sure they are at the coal face explaining the advantages of Ireland." budget He said he would be fully announcing a raft of incentives for first-time home property buyers, but that the "big issue" was to get agreement across all ministers ahead of the October Budget. "It's a fortnight away and there are lots of different inputs now - we have three independent ministers with separate views in the cabinet, and we have our own parliamentary party, influencing budget decisions, and then we have Fianna Fáil who are supporting us in terms of the opposition," he said. "In terms of putting a budget in place, there are a lot of views that have to be taken into account, but so far, the views don't seem to be conflicting in any dramatic way, so I'm quiet confident that we'll put a good Budget through," he added. During a mirthful moment, when the minister was asked if he was worried Michael Martin would soon come knocking on his door to say time was up for him and the rest of the present government, he chirped: "There are no signs of that. I don't think Michael Martin knows where I live, so he'd have difficulty knocking on the door." Personal health and political future The minister also deflected questions surrounding his present health status. "I have nothing to say beyond what I said during the week," he added, regarding concerns about his health. Asked if he had a desire to stay on as a member of the until the next election, Mr Noonan said: "I don't know when the next election is, so you're asking me to make a commitment to a target, which nobody knows when that target will be. So, we'll wait and see. I took on a job and I'm doing the job, and I'll continue to do it." Judicial council Asked about Chief Justice, Susan Denham's comments this morning, that Ireland's reputation is being effected due to a lack of action by successive governments around the question of the setting up of a judicial council, Mr Noonan said: "I never make comments on statements made by the judiciary, but I understand there was a statement from the department of justice, committing to move in the direction that the Chief Justice has indicated."

Starting with watchOS 3, you can customize your workout metrics, and in this tutorial, we’ll talk about all the ways you can do that. What are workout metrics? The workout metrics let you see a real time representation of what’s going on. For example, you can see things like how long you’ve been working out, your heart rate, the amount of calories you’re burning, and more. There are two kinds of metric modes you can take advantage of on your Apple Watch: multiple and single. Examples of both are shown below. Multiple vs Simple metrics In multiple metrics mode, you can have up to five different kinds of metrics displaying on your Apple Watch’s screen during a workout at once. On the contrary, single metric mode shows only one kind of metric on your Apple Watch’s screen during a workout at once and you can use the digital crown to scroll through more of them, one by one. You can easily switch between these two modes from the Apple Watch app on your iPhone. Just go to My Watch → Workout → Workout View and choose the configuration you want: Which is better? Honestly it comes down to personal preference. If you like larger text, you might opt for the single metric mode. On the other hand, if you like more information at a glance, then you might opt for the multiple metric mode. Customizing the metrics for your workouts If you choose multiple metric mode, you can customize the metrics that appear on your Apple Watch’s display during a workout based on the information you really want to see. The metrics available depend on the type of workout you choose. For example, note the different metrics available in Outdoor Walk when compared to Elliptical: To customize what metrics will appear on your Apple Watch’s display while you perform your workout, go to My Watch → Workout → Workout View and tap on the workout type you want to customize. Once you’re in, you’ll see a list of metrics you can use. There are two headings: Metrics and Do Not Include. Any metrics you stick under the Metrics heading will appear on your Apple Watch and any metrics you stick under the Do Not Include heading will be hidden from your Apple Watch. To modify the list, tap on the Edit button and use the grabbers to reposition any of the metrics under the two headers: You can have a maximum of five metrics on the display at once, so you won’t be able to add any more than five to the Metrics header at any given time. You can change the unit of measure for your metrics You can also change the unit of measure for your metrics. To do this, you’re going to need to pay a visit to the Health app on your iPhone. When you open it, tap on the Activity button, then scroll down to where you see various workout types and then tap on the one you want to modify. In this case, we’ll be changing the Cycling Distance metric, so we’ll tap on it. When we do, we’re brought to the Cycling Distance settings and we’ll tap on the Unit cell to modify the unit of measure: Since we’re dealing with a unit of measure for distance, logically we have two unit of measure options: kilometers or miles. The units of measure vary depending on the workout type you choose to customize. Now that you know how to customize your workout metrics on your Apple Watch, you can set things up so your workouts are tailored to your needs.

It gets boring… bertal34 Great article and nice flexibility here with the apps. I’m wondering if anyone else has experienced an issue I had over the weekend. Just finished a half marathon running with only my Apple Watch series 2. I was a bit disappointed because while using the workout app, metrics such as distance, time, pace were hidden! Every time I looked at my watch it said outdoor run with no metrics. The watch did record these metrics however the metric view seemed to be hidden on a separate tab. Meaning I could swipe left and partially see the metrics. I contacted Apple and they had not heard of this. Only had me restart watch and unpair with iPhone. What do you think happened? Sebastien Sounds to me it’s just a random bug. Did rebooting the watch or impairing/pairing again fix the problem? bertal34 You are probably right, it just happened at a horrible time for me. Rebooting the watch seemed to fix the problem and it hasn’t happened since.   Search Connect with iDownloadBlog Facebook Become a fan RSS Get the latest news YouTube Watch Us Twitter Stay up to date Newsletter News delivered to you Google+ Add us to your circle   The most recent headlines Apple Chinese New Year promo: free Beats Solo3 headphones with Mac or iPhone Resetting AirPods fixes charging case battery woes for some users Rumor: Apple seeding first iOS 10.3 beta on January 10 with new ‘Theatre’ mode Daily Deals: $70 off Beyerdynamic headphones, 10 iTunes movies for $10, and more Beautiful iPhone 7 photos show New Year’s Eve celebrations around the world   The latest jailbreak news Jailbreak tweaks of the week: CCLowPower, CCRecord, Evanesco, & more… CCLowPower adds a Low Power Mode toggle to Control Center ForceInPicture enables Picture in Picture mode on unsupported devices CCRecord: a tweak to quickly and easily record your iPhone screen Customize your iOS 10 Control Center toggle colors with Cream 2 and Creamless iDownloadBlog           iDownloadblog.com About About Advertise Contact Keep in Touch Twitter Facebook RSS Feed Newsletter Push Notifications Podcasts Let's Talk iOS Let's Talk Jailbreak Site Stuff Disclosure Privacy Policy   Copyright iDownloadBlog 2017.

If you said the $19 Lightning-to-USB cable that can charge your iPhone, you would have been right -- until Tim Cook made the iPhone 7 announcement Wednesday. A lot of cool things were announced at the keynote, and most of them are expensive, but I don't think anyone anticipated that Apple would release a new winner for cheapest item in the Apple store. The item in question is the new Lightning-to-3.5mm headphone jack adapter, which costs just $9. Of course, Apple is including one of these adapters with every new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, but if I know anything, it's that people are going to lose a lot of these adapters. Apple should probably consider selling them in multi-packs. As long as we're talking about headphones, let's take a minute to mention Apple's new wireless AirPods. They look like EarPods with the cables cut off, but the AirPods are Apple's new fancy high-end headphone offering that will cost $159 when they are released in October. The AirPods use Bluetooth to connect, and they are supposed to automatically pair themselves to your iPhone and Apple Watch, as well as your iPad and Mac. I'm kind of curious to see how well the auto-pairing works. During the announcement, I was worried the AirPods would only work with the iPhone 7 models, but as soon as the keynote was over and Apple's website was updated, I saw the AirPod compatability list, which includes every Apple watch, every phone back to the iPhone 5, every iPad back to the Air and Mini 2, and sixth-generation iPod Touch models. They come with a case with a built-in battery that can keep the AirPods charged up for more than 24 hours of listening, although you will have to charge them after five hours of use. They will quick-charge in the case, and a 15-minute visit to the battery case will give three hours of listening.

The company reportedly sold 25% fewer iPhones during the weekend after its launch than it did during the same period in 2015, following the launch of the iPhone 6s . The figures come from German market research institute GfK, which analyses Apple's sales channels in Europe and Asia. The company does not measure sales in the US. iPhone 7 GfK said that that its report was not intended for external release. “Numbers on sales or market shares are confidentially provided to our clients and shall not be quoted or released to the public,” GfK said in a statement.

(AP / Richard Drew, File) Linda Nguyen, The Canadian Press Published Monday, September 26, 2016 6:30AM EDT TORONTO -- It's something financial planner Mark Coutts sees from time to time. Clients comes into his Toronto office and tell him they want to invest in a company's stock based solely on its brand-name recognition. Often, it's an investment strategy he cautions against. "Just because you own an iPhone doesn't necessarily mean that Apple is the right stock for you. Just because you get a coffee every morning at Tim Hortons doesn't mean that's the right investment for you," said Coutts, an adviser at Sun Life Financial. "It means you understand the product, but do you understand all the other factors you would normally consider when making any investment decision: the strength of the management, their competitive advantage, the maturity of the industry, the economic factors that impact that sector. Those are all factors you should bake into the equation." The idea of investing in what you know has been touted by many, including legendary investor Warren Buffett. The reasoning behind it is that people have a better grasp on what they're investing in if they understand the products or services of the company. While owning a piece of large, well-known companies may be attractive to many, one of the risks investors can run into is missing out on the potential for faster or bigger growth if they only stick to the tried-and-true brands. With Apple, for instance, investors may want to buy the company's shares because they see the huge lineups out the door every time it launches a new product. But getting in on the company now may be expensive, and there may be more growth opportunities if investors looks at smaller firms that may have a connection to Apple, such as its chip maker. Coutts says buying into big, brand-name stocks also doesn't guarantee perpetuity, such as the cases of Bombardier and the now bankrupt Canadian tech firm Nortel Networks, which both saw their shares plummet. But on the flip side, HollisWealth senior adviser Allan Small says that although investors may be drawn to new, emerging startups because they have more potential to grow -- their longevity and returns are also not guaranteed. "You have to be really careful. Just because a young company has promise and potential doesn't mean it will shoot up and continue to go on forever," he said. "Sometimes owning a company like that makes sense if you're an investor who can handle the risks associated with it. But for those who want steady and slow because they believe that's what wins the race -- these bigger names may fit the bill." Small says investors need to evaluate their risk tolerance, time horizon and goals with any investment strategy. Avoiding home bias is another consideration, adds portfolio manager Adrian Mastracci. For instance, some investors only want to invest in Canadian stocks and don't even consider American or international stocks. Instead, he suggests diversification as a better guideline to follow for sound investment plans. "Just because you're a foodie, you shouldn't just pick A&W (restaurant) stocks because you won't have enough diversification," said Mastracci, president at KCM Wealth Management in Vancouver. "I like putting all the sectors in a portfolio because I don't know which ones are going to be good ones." He advocates buying shares when times are bad and selling shares when times are good -- in other words, buying low and selling high. "That's the better approach as opposed to loading up on a particular stock because you think it's big," Mastracci said. "Size is great but it's not always going to save you."

Now we haven't been granted any special access to the inner sanctum at Apple's headquarters in Cupertino, California, but we do have a few ideas about what makes a great phone, which we're happy to share in the form of our wishlist for the iPhone 7S. A higher-resolution, bezel-less screen You could argue that the iPhones don't need to follow the herd when it comes to the screen resolution race, but the 1,334 x 750 pixel display sported by the iPhone 7 is starting to look alarmingly out of date against the 2,560 x 1,440 specs available on most of the flagship handsets out there right now. We also like the sound of the rumours doing the rounds that Apple wants to make the whole of the front of the phone one single glass display, with the home button and the front-facing camera actually embedded in it somehow. Having no bezels to speak of would no doubt make it the best-looking iPhone yet. More flexibility in iOS 11 It's unlikely, but this is a wishlist, so we're going to include it anyway: more ways to customise the software of the iPhone, whether that's changing the layout of icons on the home screen or being able to swap away from iMessage as the default messaging app. Down the years Apple has made iOS slightly more friendly to non-Apple platforms but it's still a pain to use alongside a phone or a computer without the Apple logo on it. Each successive iPhone seems designed to make it even harder to switch to something else. Android has its faults too of course but it does at least allow you to make your phone your own - and that's something iOS could learn from. Dual-cameras all round One of the ways that Apple has distinguished the iPhone 7 Plus models from the normal ones (apart from size) has been the camera - and this year the iPhone 7 Plus got a dual-camera upgrade, enabling 2x optical zoom and shallow depth of field effects (which are on the way with a software upgrade apparently). We'd like to see Apple give both phones camera parity next year, so that means two lenses in each iPhone. It means those that buy the smaller version aren't missing out in the camera capability department and there's still the larger screen size and battery size to give the Plus a reason for existing. Space may be an issue, but we're confident Apple can pull it off. Better reasons for 3D Touch to exist 3D Touch hasn't really been a roaring success for the engineers at Apple, perhaps because app developers can't make it too essential for fear of leaving those on older handsets behind. As time goes on, though, that becomes less of an issue. We'd like to see some really intuitive uses for the technology in the next edition of the iPhone, rather than just an afterthought. With so many of Apple's own apps making up the bulk of iOS, the company can lead the way with its own software and show the rest how it's done. Eventually a hard press could become as useful as a swipe or a pinch in terms of iPhone gestures. Wireless charging Wireless charging might not seem like the biggest issue in the world for a lot of people, but once you've got used to the convenience of the tech it's difficult to go back to cables. It's something that seems to be rumoured for the iPhone every cycle so let's hope 2017 is the year Apple finally gets around to adding it - no doubt the designers inside the company could come up with a suitably sleek and attractive hub to put on the top of your desk. Battery life is something many of us worry about (see below) so having your iPhone start charging every time you set it down at home or in the office can make a real difference. Better battery life (of course) This is always a high priority on any phone, and the iPhones are no different. Apple is promising the 2016 iPhones are better than ever in terms of battery life, but there's always room for improvement - and we'd like to see lots more of it in 2017. It's not just about the size of the battery, of course - all the internal wiring plays a part in how long you can go between charges - so there are plenty of tweaks to be made. Apple's big advantage is it has full control over the hardware and the software of its devices and we'd like to see it push the limits of battery life even further. Maybe one day we'll be able to go more than a day without recharging...
