Live Watch President Obama, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Others React to Steve Jobs' Death By Lauren Effron Close Follow on Twitter More from Lauren Oct. 5, 2011 0 Shares Email Star PlayApple.com WATCH Outpouring Over Jobs' Death 0 Shares Email Hailed as a visionary and a technological genius, Steve Jobs' death prompted several Fortune 500 company CEOs, celebrities, politicians, fellow tech-savvy experts and Apple lovers to offer their condolences and praises of Jobs' life accomplishments. Apple, Inc. also launched a shout-out tribute page on their website, Apple.com, inviting all to share their "thoughts, memories and condolences." Jobs died of pancreatic cancer on Wednesday. He was 56. Here are their words: Statement from President Barack Obama: "Michelle and I are saddened to learn of the passing of Steve Jobs. Steve was among the greatest of American innovators - brave enough to think differently, bold enough to believe he could change the world, and talented enough to do it. By building one of the planet's most successful companies from his garage, he exemplified the spirit of American ingenuity. By making computers personal and putting the internet in our pockets, he made the information revolution not only accessible, but intuitive and fun. And by turning his talents to storytelling, he has brought joy to millions of children and grownups alike. Steve was fond of saying that he lived every day like it was his last. Because he did, he transformed our lives, redefined entire industries, and achieved one of the rarest feats in human history: he changed the way each of us sees the world. The world has lost a visionary. And there may be no greater tribute to Steve's success than the fact that much of the world learned of his passing on a device he invented. Michelle and I send our thoughts and prayers to Steve's wife Laurene, his family, and all those who loved him." Statement from Bill Gates: "I'm truly saddened to learn of Steve Jobs' death. Melinda and I extend our sincere condolences to his family and friends, and to everyone Steve has touched through his work. Steve and I first met nearly 30 years ago, and have been colleagues, competitors and friends over the course of more than half our lives. The world rarely sees someone who has had the profound impact Steve has had, the effects of which will be felt for many generations to come. For those of us lucky enough to get to work with him, it's been an insanely great honor. I will miss Steve immensely. " Eric Schmidt, chairman of Google Inc., and former Apple board member, in an exclusive interview with "This Week" anchor Chrisitane Amanpour: "He's clearly the most effective and successful American CEO in the last 50 years. He didn't just found Apple, and he didn't actually just make it successful in the first decade, he also took it after a bad period, and rebuilt it. Which has essentially never been done in an American corporations, to be the extraordinary company it is today. To me, Steve proves that nerds don't win. Artists do. And that Steve who is both a technologist, but really an artist, shows that art matters and the rest of us missed the fact that beautiful simple products are what people want." "[Jobs is] a personal friend and I served on his board for three years. And in his case, working with his, they just adore working for him, and although he's famously loud and precise and so forth, they respect him so much. I think in many ways, Steve is who he is because he's just so smart. And that when you have someone who is just that brilliant and is able to integrate those ways in ways that almost no one else in the world can, he gets the extra bit of respect that allows him to be a great leader." Statement from Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook founder and CEO: "Steve, thank you for being a mentor and a friend. Thanks for showing that what you build can change the world. I will miss you." Statement from George Lucas, filmmaker/producer, creator of "Star Wars" and "Indiana Jones" series: "The magic of Steve was that while others simply accepted the status quo, he saw the true potential in everything he touched and never compromised on that vision. He leaves behind an incredible family and a legacy that will continue to speak to people for years to come." Statement from Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen: "My condolences to Steve Jobs family and friends. We've lost a unique tech pioneer and auteur who knew how to make amazingly great products." Statement from John Lasseter, chief creative officer at Pixar and Walt Disney Animation Studios: "Steve Jobs was an extraordinary visionary, our very dear friend and the guiding light of the Pixar family. He saw the potential of what Pixar could be before the rest of us, and beyond what anyone ever imagined. Steve took a chance on us and believed in our crazy dream of making computer animated films; the one thing he always said was to simply 'make it great.' He is why Pixar turned out the way we did and his strength, integrity and love of life has made us all better people. He will forever be a part of Pixar?s DNA. Our hearts go out to his wife Laurene and their children during this incredibly difficult time." Statement from Walt Disney Company president Bob Iger: "Steve Jobs was a great friend as well as a trusted advisor. His legacy will extend far beyond the products he created or the businesses he built. It will be the millions of people he inspired, the lives he changed, and the culture he defined. Steve was such an "original," with a thoroughly creative, imaginative mind that defined an era. Despite all he accomplished, it feels like he was just getting started. With his passing the world has lost a rare original, Disney has lost a member of our family, and I have lost a great friend. Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife Laurene and his children during this difficult time." Statement from Jerry Yang, Yahoo!, Inc. co-founder and former CEO: "Steve was my hero growing up. He not only gave me a lot of personal advice and encouragement, he showed all of us how innovation can change lives. I will miss him dearly, as will the world." Statement from Howard Stringer, Sony Corp. CEO "The digital age has lost its leading light, but Steve's innovation and creativity will inspire dreamers and thinkers for generations." Statement from House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. "Steve Jobs was a visionary who changed the way we live, an innovator whose products brought joy to millions, a risktaker who wasn't afraid to challenge the status quo, and an entrepreneur who led one of the most creative companies of our time. "His sage advice was respected by policymakers on both sides of the aisle. His courageous fight against cancer brought strength to many. "I hope it is a comfort to those who loved him, especially his family, that so many grieve his loss and are praying for them at this sad time." Statement from California Gov. Edmund Brown: "Steve Jobs was a great California innovator who demonstrated what a totally independent and creative mind can accomplish. Few people have made such a powerful and elegant imprint on our lives. Anne and I wish to express our deepest sympathy to Steve's wife, Laurene, and their entire family." Statement from New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg: "Tonight, America lost a genius who will be remembered with Edison and Einstein, and whose ideas will shape the world for generations to come. Again and again over the last four decades, Steve Jobs saw the future and brought it to life long before most people could even see the horizon. And Steve's passionate belief in the power of technology to transform the way we live brought us more than smart phones and iPads: it brought knowledge and power that is reshaping the face of civilization. In New York City's government, everyone from street construction inspectors to NYPD detectives have harnessed Apple's products to do their jobs more efficiently and intuitively. Tonight our City - a city that has always had such respect and admiration for creative genius - joins with people around the planet in remembering a great man and keeping Laurene and the rest of the Jobs family in our thoughts and prayers." Statement from Wynton Marsalis, jazz musician "Steve Jobs was a man of absolute integrity. He pursued the deepest truths in his imagination with unabashed passion, uncompromising singularity of purpose, and unyielding urgency. Apple's tenacious actualization of his transformative and lofty vision of integration brings us closer together. He was a force of nature, a volcano, and a man who loves and misses his family. The world is much poorer today. And always." Statement from Jeffrey Biegel, pianist and composer "Steve Jobs expanded technology and the progress of computerization from the 20th to the 21st century as Ludwig van Beethoven transcended the world of music, transitioning from late Classical style to the Romantic style from the 18th century into the 19th century. Mr. Jobs legacy is forever etched in the pages of time and history for generations to follow."

Here’s a list of the five best options ranging in price from around $100 to over $2500. When Apple introduced the iPad back in 2010, it wasn’t the first tablet to hit the market because plenty of Windows Tablet PCs existed. Today, Apple’s tablet stands out from the crowd in terms of sales and mind share. In fact, the term iPad is synonymous for many people with the word tablet regardless of the brand. Not everyone wants an iPad, though, and they’re looking for good alternatives like the five here. Some users want a Windows computer that runs their programs instead of apps. Vertical markets often rely on proprietary software without an iOS or even Android version available. Only a Windows tablet will do. That’s why we’ve rounded up a list of the 5 best iPad alternatives that run Microsoft Windows. These Windows tablets come in various sizes and speeds, but they all run a full version of Windows and can potentially run all or most of your Windows software. We avoided the 2-in-1 convertibles with the keyboard permanently attached except for one favorite. The rest will function without a keyboard attached and some come with specially designed keyboards like the Surface Pro 4 and Samsung’s Galaxy TabPro S. Microsoft Surface Pro 4 – Best of the iPad Alternatives Probably the best Windows tablet available comes from Microsoft. Every model of the Surface Pro 4 includes the great all metal hardware design with a fantastic 12.3-inch display boasting a 2736 x 1824 resolution. The display has excellent multi-touch capability and works with the amazing Microsoft Surface Pen. It might be the best stylus available on a tablet, except for maybe the iPad’s Apple Pencil. The Surface Pro 4 has a full-sized USB 3.0 port, a micro-SD card slot, headset/mic combo jack, and a DisplayPort. The bottom edge also connects to the Surface Type Cover, which comes extra for $129.99 without a fingerprint reader and $159.99 with one. They also now sell a Signature Edition Type Cover with special fabric material, but no fingerprint reader. It’s also $159.99. Enjoy up to 9 hours of battery life, depending on your screen brightness, the programs you running and the processor you have. Speaking of processors, Microsoft configures the tablet with the following combinations and prices: Intel Core m3 processor, 128GB SSD and 4GB of RAM for $699 (sale price, regularly $799). Intel Core i5 Processor, 128GB SSD and 4GB of RAM for $999. Intel Core i5 Processor, 256GB SSD and 4GB of RAM for $1,099 (normally $1,199). Intel Core i7 Processor, 256GB SSD and 8GB of RAM for $1,499. Users can also configure other combinations. We maxed out the specs with 16GB of RAM, Intel Core i7 Processor and 1TB SSD and it costs $2,599. For more coverage on the Surface Pro 4 see the following posts from our team: Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Review 11 Exciting Things You Can Do With a Surface Pro 4 How to Set Up a New Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Samsung Galaxy TabPro S – Gives Surface Competition The Samsung Galaxy TabPro S might seem like a “me-too” device from Samsung copying the hardware of the Surface Pro 4, but that’s a good thing. It copies it in the best areas and even adds some improvements. First, here’s a list of the specs that make this an impressive alternative to the iPad Pro for $799 and $749 at B&H Photo: 2.2GHz  Intel Core M Dual-Core processor 4GB of RAM 128GB SSD 12-inch 2160 x 1440 AMOLED display 1 Type C USB port 1 headphone/mic combo jack 802.11ac and Bluetooth 4.1 Built-in GPS and NFC Up to 10 hours battery life Some specs that stand out in comparison to the Surface Pro 4 include the AMOLED display and a Type-C USB port. Samsung’s AMOLED displays look amazing with bright and rich colors. Type-C future proofs the tablet a little since that’s the direction computing is going. Samsung also added GPS and NFC to the list. That makes it more useful on the road and for quick connections via NFC. It also includes the keyboard at that price which is something Microsoft doesn’t do. The Samsung C Pen that gives the tablet pressure sensitive writing and drawing features like the Surface Pen costs extra ($79.99 retail, but it’s usually available for under $60 at Amazon or B&H Photo). Dell Latitude 11 7000 Series – Best of Midrange iPad Alternatives The Dell Latitude 11 5000 Series tablet starts at about $750. It competes with the Surface Pro 4 since it comes with an optional keyboard that attaches to a port along the bottom edge. The 10.8-inch screen features a 1920 x 1080 display that supports multi-touch and the Dell mini-pen for writing and drawing on the screen. An optional keyboard connects to a special port on the bottom edge giving users a laptop-style experience with their tablet. Starting at $749, buyers can get an Intel Core M3 processor, 4GB of RAM and 128GB SSD. Other optional configurations can include an M5 processor, up to 8GB of memory and a 256GB drive. Maxed out it costs $1,068. The list of ports and buttons includes: 1 USB Type C 3.1 port for data and charging Full-size USB 3.0 port Micro-HDMI Headphone/mic combo port Fingerprint reader Micro-SD card reader Noble lock slot for security Volume up/down rocker Windows button Lenovo IdeaPad Miix 310 – Best of the Low-cost iPad Alternatives This ten-inch system comes in at $300 making it the cheapest tablet in the round-up.  In fact Amazon sells it for even less at $233. It runs on an Intel Atom X5 Z8350 processor, which means it’s also the lowest powered device in our list. The 2GB of RAM and 64GB SSD means this machine is best for browsing the web, running simple programs and reading. You can also stream audio and video. The 10.1-inch display sports a lower resolution of 1280 x 800. You can run that display for up to 10 hours. Add Bluetooth 4.0 and 802.11 b/g/n for connectivity. There’s a keyboard dock to connect the detachable keyboard included with the tablet. Other ports include a micro-HDMI, micro-SD card reader, headphone/mic combo jack, micro-USB 2.0 and 2 full-size USB 2.0 ports on the keyboard. The tablet alone weighs only 1.28 lbs and less than 2.5 with the keyboard attached. That makes it one of the lightest available. NuVision TM800W610L Signature Edition Tablet – Bargain Basement The NuVision Signature Edition Tablet makes our list for two reasons. It’s super cheap at only $150 from Microsoft Store or $100 at Amazon and it’s one of the only 8-inch Windows tablets available today. Buyers can look hard for some models that are no longer manufactured. Dell’s Venue 8 and the Toshiba Encore 2 8-inch model still show up on Amazon and other places, but Dell and Toshiba don’t make them anymore. NuVision designed the Signature Edition Tablet with a basic black plastic case, a 1920 x 1200 resolution, an Intel Atom processor and a meager 2GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. It comes with an expansion slot that supports up to 128GB in the form of a micro-SD card. The battery lasts up to 6 hours, a little low these days. But that’s probably enough for most people who will use this as a Windows book reader plus social networking, Internet and email. It can handle things like Netflix or streaming audio, too. The tablet has a single micro-USB port, a micro-HDMI port and mic/audio combo port. Add Bluetooth 4.o and 802.11n Miracast enabled Wi-Fi. Miracast lets users cast the screen to supported devices like the Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter or a Roku Box or Stick. Which Windows Tablet to Buy? So which of these five tablets should you buy? If you just want the best tablet available without concern for price, go with the Surface Pro 4 and get as much as you can afford. It’s a great device and works well as a laptop with occasionally using it as a tablet. The Samsung Galaxy TabPro S gives the Surface Pro a run for the money, so find one at a Best Buy store or Microsoft Store to see if you like the AMOLED screen better. Also, the USB Type-C port might make it a better option for some, since that’s the future of connectivity. People who want the smallest and cheapest should look at the NuVision. It’s under-powered for most tasks, but not for the very basic tasks of reading books, playing streaming video or music, and doing your day-to-day email tasks. You can even hook it up to an external display to use it for presentations or hook up a keyboard and get some work done. Buy the Lenovo if you want a larger 10-inch screen, but also want a lower price and have basic needs. The 1280 x 800 resolution seems a bit low, but the long battery life that comes as a result will make road warriors with limited needs happy. The included detachable keyboard makes it a great deal. The Dell’s a good mid-range option for people who can’t afford the Surface or Samsung, but want more than the Lenovo or NuVision tablets offer.

The Best iPhone Apps Here are the iPhone apps that I use the most. These are the iPhone apps that I keep on my home screen and the dock. Although this list doesn’t break down into nice categories, here is a look at the most useful iPhone apps I own. I’ll leave the default Apple apps off this list, but there are many on my home screen that I cannot live without. Google Maps – Hands down a better way to get from one place to the next or to search for places than Apple Maps. It has yet to tell me to drive off a non-existent bridge. I cannot say the same about Apple Maps. Huntington – Even with text notifications it is important for me to have access to my banking app on the home screen, and the ability to remotely deposit checks with the iPhone. SoundCloud – A great way to check out sets from music festivals and hard to find tracks from DJs and artists before they are on other services. Spotify – The best way to listen to music on the iPhone. Spotify is more evolved than Apple Music and it is a bargain at $9.99 a month. Audible – I listen to an incredible number of Audiobooks and Audible is the best place to buy them. With a subscription I save on audiobooks each month. Dark Sky – Great, hyper local forecasts and push notifications that tell me when it is going to rain or snow. Alien Blue – This is still the best iPhone Reddit app I’ve found, but I am looking for a replacement. Slack – If you work on a team or in a small office forget the hassles of email for internal communication and switch to Slack. You’ll love it. Asana – This is a to do list app and service that works great for teams, but you can also use it for your own tasks and projects. MyFitnessPal – MyFitnessPal is one of the best weight loss iPhone apps and it was the key to helping me lose 25 pounds this year. After a break I am back in the app to keep the weight off. Nest – The Nest app connects to my Nest thermostat to let me control the temperature of my house from bed or from a hundred miles away. This saves me energy and it’s an awesome convenience app. Harmony – I use the Harmony app along with the Logitech Harmony Ultimate Home remote and hub to control my home entertainment and lights. I can tap on Play Xbox One and the Tv, Xbox, soundbar and lights all turn to the right settings. I can also control my TV volume and channels with the iPhone. Hue – I control and customize five Hue lights with this app. I will be upgrading soon to use Siri to control the lights. Lutron Caséta – The Lutron Caséta app lets me use Siri and the app to turn lamps on and off at home using the Caséta Wireless switches and to control my Kitchen Lights after I replaced the switches. No need to upgrade bulbs for a smart home experience. MyQ – This app lets me open and close my Chamberlain WiFi garage door with my iPhone. I get push notifications, although on iOS 9 they sometimes double up, to let me know someone opened the door. HDE OTP – I use this app instead of Google Authenticator to track the many One Time Passwords I need to use as Two-Factor Authentication for several websites. Hangouts – Google Hangouts is an essential tool for communicating with friends, co-workers and family. LastPass – I only need to remember one password and I can use my long list of complicated passwords. Touch ID allows me to reach them with the touch of a finger instead of typing my password out. Read my LastPass review. Tweetbot 4 – The newest version of Tweetbot is an amazing way to connect to Twitter. It handles all my needs for sending messages and the new Activity tab removes the need for me to use the default Twitter app to track follows and retweets. Gmail – The Gmail app is a great way for most users to check email on the iPhone and an essential app for many people on our team. Notion – Notion.ai is the best iPhone email app you can find. It delivers smart notifications, easy inbox management and even knows when someone asks you a question. You need to try this app out today. These three apps earn an honorable mention on my home screen list since I keep them with easy access on my second home screen so that I can always access them. Evernote – The new Notes app is my go to app, but Evernote still offers a great place to save and track notes. I used this to track all communication about lost luggage and to share the notebook with interested parties easily. Workflow – Workflow lets you automate activities and tasks on the iPhone 6s, and it supports 3D Touch quick actions to your favorites. I am just scratching the surface of what it can do and I am amazed. Kindle – The Kindle app is my go to app for reading. I love it because I can use it to start a book, read more later on my Kindle and also always have the freedom to jump to another platform. 1Password – If you aren’t a fan of LastPass, 1Password is an excellent option that helps you keep all of your passwords safe behind, you guessed it one password. Calm – When you need a break from your hectic life, the Calm app will help you relax and refresh using your iPhone, headphones and a chair. Ring – You’ll need the Ring doorbell to make use of this app, but once you install it you can see and talk to people who ring your doorbell, even if you are miles away. Best iPhone Photography Apps I use these iPhone photography apps to make my photos look better, connect to my camera and share photos and videos. I use iCloud Photo Library to back up my photos, but if you don’t you should check out Flickr or Google Photos. YouTube Capture – – Record videos quickly and upload to YouTube in a snap. Perfect for content creators. Camera+ – A handy app that can perform magical automatic fixes for photos that need better lighting with one touch. Instagram – Fun place to explore photos and share photos. 3D Touch makes browsing in the Explore mode easier than ever. PlayMemories Mobile – I use this app to connect to my Sony RX 100 III and transfer photos to the iPhone for editing and sharing. Pixelmator – My favorite desktop photo editor is now on iPhone allowing me to quickly fix up and edit photos. iMovie – I often shoot review videos on the iPhone 6s and I can use iMovie to edit the 4K video I shoot and then choose to upload in 4K or in 1080P. TouchReTouch – This app performs miracles when you need to restore an old photo that has cracks, creases and damage. Simply amazing. Darkroom – This is another photo editing app that I enjoy using on the iPhone 6s. One thing I like is that there are sliders on one screen to adjust multiple options so I can easily adjust one and then the next. Afterlight – Powerful photo editing tool with filters, lots of control and the option to tap to see the original and let go to see your current edits for easy before and after editing. Layout – A simple tool from Instagram to combine photos into a collage on the iPhone to share on Instagram or another service. Best iPhone Games Here are the best iPhone games that I enjoy playing. There are a lot of great iPhone games out there and we expect to see more games add 3D Touch for the iPhone 6s in the coming weeks and months. Monument Valley – A fun and challenging puzzle style game that tasks gamers with moving the environment around until you can get your character to the right door. Threes! – Slide tiles around to match up numbers. Starts off simple, but gets challenging quickly as your numbers climb higher. Alto’s Adventure – Jump and ski your way to the bottom of a never-ending mountain as you collect llamas, run from village elders and collect power ups. Agar.io – Control growing circle that expands as it absorbs smaller circles until you are the biggest blob on the board. Simple, but addicting. Siegefall – A strategy game similar to Clash of Clans, but with a less cartoonish look. This is my favorite of the tow games and worth trying out. Clash of Clans – We can’t list off the best apps without touching on Clash of Clans which many iPhone users are addicted to playing. If you like it, you probably love it. Shadowmatic – My latest addiction is a puzzle type game where you move objects around to create a shadow on the wall. It is a simple premise, but the difficulty increases as you progress. Does Not Commute – Guide cars around the city to get them to the destination without crossing and crashing with the traffic you already put into place with earlier cars. Madden Mobile – A small fix of Madden on the iPhone. It isn’t as good as Madden 16 on the Xbox One, but it is a fun way to pass some time. Smashy Road: Wanted – A fun time waster for driving around and escaping the police with simple graphics. Fallout Shelter – Manage resources and grow your shelter in this Fallout game that is a perfect fit for the iPhone screen size. Fun and frustrating at the same time as you balance inhabitants and resources. Super Sharp – This fun puzzle game is challenging, incredibly fun and frustrating. You cut parts of the level to hit targets and often need to set up several cuts to proceed. Best iPhone Entertainment Apps Here are the go to apps I use to watch video on the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. I don’t keep as many on here as I do on the iPad Air 2, but there are must have apps in this list. DirecTV – I can watch live TV on my iPhone using my DirecTV subscription. I don’t get all of my channels, but there are enough great options. WatchESPN – Finally I can use DirecTV to login to WatchESPN to see sports events and Sports Center on the go. NFL Mobile – With my Verizon iPhone 6s I can watch the Sunday Night, Monday Night and Thursday Night Football games live on the iPhone. Remote – The fastest way to control the Apple TV from the iPhone. Makes selection, searching and entering passwords very easy. Netflix – How else can I keep up on Narcos and binge watch too many TV shows on my iPhone for $8 a month? ESPN – I use this app to track teams, which lately simply lets me see how the Miami Dolphins are losing before my coworkers mention it. NFL Sunday Ticket – I am constantly busy on Sunday, no matter how I plan it, so I rely on NFL Sunday Ticket to watch the Miami Dolphins on my iPhone 6s. Xbox One SmartGlass – With this app I can connect to my Xbox to change the game I am playing, enter in text and see and respond to messages without leaving a game. Yahoo Fantasy  – You can use this app to track almost any thing you need to stay on top of your fantasy sports team. Hulu – If you don’t want to pay for cable, this is one of the easiest ways to keep up on the latest shows without buying a bunch of season passes in iTunes. HBO Go – Watch HBO on your iPhone using your cable login, or use HBO Now to watch with a subscription direct to HBO. Access new shows and the full library of HBO Shows, plus current movies. YouTube – The YouTube app is the fastest way to watch YouTube videos on your iPhone and a great way to subscribe to channels you like. Amazon Instant Video – Amazon Prime members can use this to watch free streaming video on the iPhone including movies and TV shows without an additional subscription. Best Business iPhone Apps I use these apps to keep on top of business needs from my iPhone, from tracking packages, checking invoices paid and other utilities. These iPhone apps help me get things done. UPS – With UPS My Choice and this app I can see when packages will come and even change delivery options if I need to. Fedex – With this app and registration with FedEx I can see all FedEx packages coming to my house from Ground and Express in one place. Even when I don’t have a tracking number. Speedtest – I often find myself testing the network connection and mobile connection before working or uploading a big file. With this app I can see if my current location supports what I need to do. Scanner Pro – Scanner Pro lets me quickly scan in a document without a scanner. The results are amazing and you would swear that it came from a full size scanner in an office. PayPal – Quickly send money, transfer money and make payments without the need to have cash on hand. Chrome – I don’t use Chrome as my main iPhone browser, but it is handy to have installed for use with the various Google apps I rely on and for checking the open tabs from Chrome on my Mac. Facebook Pages – I use this app to manage several Facebook pages. There is no real alternative, but it is still one of my must have apps. WordPress – If you work in WordPress this app can be a lifesaver when mobile. It does eat through battery life fast and it can crash, but it allows me to get work done with just an iPhone. Google – This is essentially the Google Now experience on the iPhone. It allows me to see important information and I use it for push notifications when orders I place ship and I get an email about it. Quicklytics – The best Google Analytics app for the iPhone. Real time view, overall stats, and access to filters that let me run more detailed reports from the iPhone. Expensify – An easy to use expensing app that captures receipts and cash transactions easily. I can then share an expense report in a few minutes from the web after the trip. Quickbooks – Although QuickBooks can be a pain to use in some instances, the app is a fast way to look at the most important information relating to my account. Parkmobile – No change, no problem. I use the Parkmobile app to pay for parking in many locations. I can even re-up parking without going back to my car if I am held over in a meeting. Sheets – My most used web app is Google Sheets. I use this app to reach important spreadsheets on the go. I don’t do a ton of work on them while mobile, but this makes it easier to reference. Pages – There are still times where I need to open a Pages document on my iPhone and I also use this to check the word count of items written in apps that don’t offer a word count tool. Dropbox – Still the most accessible and easy to use cloud storage client I’ve found. This is an easy way to get to my files and to upload files for access from anywhere. Paper by fifty three – This is a go to app for sketching and marking up images. It is easier to use on a bigger screen, but it is still handy to have on the iPhone 6s. Best iPhone Shopping Apps I use these iPhone shopping apps to save money on groceries and to simplify shopping from my iPhone for almost anything I need. I leave alerts on for GasBuddy since it will tell me if gas prices are going up in my area, but most of the other apps don’t get permission to push notifications. Amazon – The fastest way to order from Amazon. If you have Amazon Prime this is a must have app. Meijer – I use this app to clip coupons digitally that I use in the store to save significantly. If you use another grocer, like Kroger, check out this guide to digital grocery coupons. Square Register – When my wife works a craft show we use this app to accept credit cards from our phone. It works like a charm. Apple Store – The fastest place to order a new iPhone is also a handy place to look for iPhone 6s accessories and other Apple items. Best Buy – As a My Best Buy member I use this app to make purchases and to check my points balance as well as see if the local store has something I want in stock. Gas Buddy – Find the cheapest gas near you and get an alert when gas prices are set to go up so that you can fill up before the price changes. Starbucks – With the new mobile ordering option the Starbucks app isn’t just a great way to pay from Wallet. You can use this to place an order and skip the line at a busy Starbucks. Chipotle – An easy way to order from Chipotle so you can skip the line and get that Burrito goodness. OpenTable – This is the fastest way to get a reservation at a restaurant. Forget calling and checking multiple times over the phone and checking with your group. See what is open and then book it without making a call. Credit Karma – Use Credit Karma to get a free look at your credit score and you can get alerts when actions that impact your credit happen. Hobby Lobby – If you shop at Hobby Lobby you need to have this app installed so you can save 40% on one item each week. Best Health Apps RunKeeper – I’ve shifted a lot of my workouts to the Apple Watch’s built-in tracker, but when I want more detail, the Runkeeper app is a solid tool that can help you track your fitness goals. Fitnet – I just started testing Fitnet. The free iPhone app offers up short focused workouts based on your goals and includes an Apple Watch app and an Apple Watch complication that shows your progress. Activity – This app installs automatically once you connect an Apple Watch. It is an easy way to see how often I hit movement and workout goals. It can motivate or shame me into doing a better job. Sleep Cycle – This app uses your iPhone to monitor your sleep and then it will wake you up at the best time based on your sleep patterns. Best iPhone Apps for Social Media Facebook – I honestly go back and forth between uninstalling and installing the Facebook app because there are times I don’t want the distraction of Facebook in my hand. I always leave notifications off. Facebook Messenger – This app is the way that I keep in touch with many friends, and it is a must have on the iPhone 6s. Snapchat – I don’t snap a lot, but I enjoy using the fun new Snapchat Lenses to change the look with fun augmented reality filters. Untappd – This is a social network for beer lovers that can help you find new beers to try and enjoy. Best iPhone Travel Apps StubHub – When you need to find tickets for a concert or sporting event that is sold out, StubHub offers a trusted environment to find the tickets you want. TripIt – The best all in one travel organizer that tracks your hotel, flight, car rental and other activities simply by connecting your email to the app or forwarding a reservation. Flightaware – Always know where a flight is. This is the best way to track the flights that your loved ones or business associates are on. Hotel Tonight – Score last-minute reservations at amazing hotels at a bargain. You can book for tonight or up to seven days out. Grub Hub – An essential tool for ordering delivery from restaurants without making a phone call. Available in 800 cities and includes 30,000 restaurants. TripAdvisor – This is the fastest and easiest way to find things to do and check reviews of hotels and attractions on your iPhone. Waze – While I normally rely on Google Maps, Waze is a tool i use when traffic is an issue. It helped us avoid a huge traffic jam and get to an event with minutes to spare instead of waiting in traffic and missing out on an amazing experience. Yelp – Yelp is my go to tool for finding a new place to eat in a new city. We also use it to discover new stores when in a bigger city and on the hunt for something local. Glympse – This tool can help you tell people when you will get to a location. Just share a Glympse with them and they can see your current location and estimated time of arrival. 11 Responses 02/24/2016 Brittanylcarlson Reply 0=1my best friend’s half-sister makes $87 /hr on the laptop .

As such, many sources and reports have been revealed in the past couple of months that speculate on how Apple is going to redefine the smartphone space with the new iPhone’s. According to The Wall Street Journal , Apple will unveil the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus along with a high-end premium ‘iPhone X’ as well. The anniversary edition iPhone, if you will, is said to be released at a price of $1,000 making it the most expensive iPhone ever. The report also states that Samsung might be providing Apple with curved OLED displays that will be a part of this exclusive ‘iPhone X’. It will also come with a revamped design and will feature bezel-less display. The WSJ also suggests that this high-end, ‘iPhone X’ will ditch Apple’s proprietary Lightning port and will instead adopt USB-C. Considering Apple updated the MacBook Pro with the same, it’s likely that Apple might want to use the industry standard on its iPhone as well. Another report by Fast Company states that the next batch of iPhone’s are “also likely to get a memory upgrade from the current iPhone 7 line.” The memory upgrade might come in the form of a new memory capacity variant, 512GB or it could just mean that the “iPhone X” will have a new and faster memory. Some sources have also told Fast Company, that the premium iPhone would be called iPhone 8 and will be accompanied by a 4.7-inch iPhone 7S and a 5.5-inch iPhone 7S Plus. The “iPhone X” or “iPhone 8” will be forged from stainless steel instead of aluminum and the rear panel will be crafted out of glass. It is also rumoured that Apple will drop the home button from the iPhone and will instead go with a touch sensitive button underneath the display. A recent report from Nikkei is synonymous with the above reports as it also mentions that the Cupertino giant will launch three iPhone’s this fall. Two of them will come with LED panel and a bigger iPhone will launch with a 5.8-inch OLED panel. The report also reaffirms the fact that Apple will raise the prices of its new iPhone’s when they launch. Apple’s 10th anniversary is a big deal for the smartphone industry as the company is regarded as bringing a consumer friendly side to smartphones and mobilised the world with their iPhone’s.

Even if it's just one then depending on the make, model and age, it may be worth digging out as some older 'retro' models are selling for hundreds of pounds online. And if the phone is only a few years old you could still be in luck as some iPhone models are currently selling for up to £600 on re-selling websites.  An original Nokia 3310 sold for £42.50 on eBay while a 1st generation iPhone went for £78 Last month, Nokia announced it was relaunching its classic 3310 model, 17 years after the original first went on sale, with a month-long battery and the game Snake pre-installed, which is believed to be available from the summer. At the news of this we checked online and found several finished eBay sales for original 3310 phones for around £40 with one recent sale for £42.50. Several other retro mobile phones were listed and we found finished auctions for the Motorola RAZR for £24.99, the Nokia 5110 for £14.99, a Blackberry Bold 9900 for £20 and a first generation iPhone which sold for £78.

Share this article Share HOW THIS IS MONEY CAN HELP Can you find cheaper home insurance? Compare the best policies for you On the whole phones went for more money if they were unlocked, in a good condition and with the original packaging. Last year we wrote about some extremely rare models selling for up to £1,000 but when it comes to the older Nokia models, most prices were around the £50 mark. However, if you have a more recent model at home, it could be worth significantly more with the iPhone 7 Plus currently selling for £612.10 on Music Magpie. The Samsung Galaxy Note 7 is selling for £350 while the iPhone SE is priced at £240 on average.

Most firms will send you an envelope which you will need to put the phone into and send back.  This is usually a freepost package and some firms will include free insurance for devices in case they are lost or damaged - but this is not standard so always double check. Make money online: You could make up to £600 by selling an older iPhone model online Once the company receives the phone, if it decides it isn't worth the amount originally quoted, it should contact you and you can either accept the lower offer or it will return it to you. If you don't want to sell your phone, you can recycle it and as up to 80 per cent of a mobile phone is recyclable, according to Recycle Now, even if the phone is broken, some of its parts are likely to be used again. Most phone retailers will accept old mobile phones for recycling but you can also hand yours over to a charity.  ASK AN EXPERT Put your question to our team of independent experts. Click the more button to email us more Oxfam says if it can refurbish an old phone it will be re-used but if it's beyond repair it will be passed onto a specialist phone recycle firm. Before you sell or give away your mobile phone, it's important you've cleared it of any personal data, such as passwords and addresses, and taken out the sim card.  This includes backing up any information you want to keep, such as photos, contacts or videos, and deleting anything you don't want to remain on it. You can do this by uploading the documents to an online cloud storage site, such as Google Drive, or by using the phone's own cloud service. Once you're confident all the data and information on the phone has been cleared, you can reset the phone to its factory setting.  This is relatively straight forward but if you're having trouble then contact your phone provider for advice.  Deals Of The Week Top rate: 5% on up to £2.500 FlexDirect 2% one-year fixed rate Top savings deal Spend £10, get £15 bonus in ANY store New members only Best buy low rate card 5.85% APR £170 giftcard & £100 free overdraft Current Account Share or comment on this article e-mail How to use your old pension allowance: Cash in on carry...

Rohit KVN   March 7, 2017 13:19 IST Picture: Apple iPhone 7 PlusREUTERS/Lucy Nicholson After exclusively launching Apple iPhone 6 (32GB) with exchange deals in India, Amazon has kicked off another promotional offer on 2016 edition iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus models with lucrative discounts in the country. Amazon India is offering flat Rs 10,001 cash discount for 32GB and 128GB models of iPhone 7 and the 7 Plus. Previously, the iPhone 7's base model used to cost Rs 60,000 and now, it can be bought for Rs 49,999. Whereas the top-end iPhone 7 Plus, whose starting price used to be Rs 72,000, is now reduced to Rs 61,999. There's more... If consumers are ready to part their old phone for the new iPhone 7, they can also avail additional discount up to Rs 13,532. Also read: Samsung launches Galaxy S7-inspired 2017-edition water-proof Galaxy A7, A5 in India; price, specifications This is an opportune moment for those who have been waiting for iPhone 7 series' price to drop, which by the way is a very rare occurrence. Usually, the price of the Apple iPhones gets lowered only when the company releases new models, meaning it happens only once a year. But, thanks to cut throat competition between e-commerce firms, they tend to burn their VC funding by slashing prices to get consumer attention. In this case, the Indian arm of Amazon, which received heavy investment amounting to thousands of crores from its American parent company recently, is using it to take on the local player Flipkart. Rival Snapdeal too had offered similar deals on Apple iPhone 7 series, but it has not been successful like Flipkart and Amazon India.

Apple Pay is finally arriving in Ireland and iPhone owners will be able to make Visa and Mastercard purchases at thousands of retail locations around Ireland just as they would their contactless cards. The launch of Apple Pay in Ireland has been three years in the making since Apple Pay was first revealed at Apple’s iPhone event in September 2014. In that time the service has launched in the larger markets like the US, UK and various countries around the world including many in Europe as well as Australia and New Zealand. However, despite waiting all this time, its arrival is something of an anti-climax. You see, while thousands of retailers across Ireland will accept payments from iPhones from today, just two participating banks will be ready at launch: KBC and Ulster Bank. Physical retailers understood to be taking part in Ireland include Lidl, Aldi, Boots, Supervalu, Applegreen and Marks and Spencer’s, to name a few. Similar to the Android Pay service launched before Christmas, Apple Pay is relatively easy to set up on an iPhone and for Apple Watch through the Watch app on the iPhone. The payment service works on iPhone 6 or later, iPhone SE, iPad Pro, iPad Air 2, iPad mini 3 or later and an Apple Watch paired to an iPhone 5 or later. Once set up each transaction is validated either through Touch ID or a passcode at the terminal. Online shopping in apps and on websites accepting Apple Pay is as simple as the touch of a finger with Touch ID, so there’s no need to manually fill out lengthy account forms or repeatedly type in shipping and billing information. Could Apple Pay be a game-changer? Mastercard said that it is working with KBC, Ulster Bank and Boon (Wirecard) to enable customers to use their Mastercard credit, debit or prepaid cards with Apple Pay from today. Security is a key aspect of Apple Pay. When you use a credit or debit card with Apple Pay, the actual card numbers are not stored on the device, nor on Apple servers. Instead, a unique Device Account Number is assigned, encrypted and securely stored in the Secure Element on your device. Each transaction is authorised with a one-time unique dynamic security code. Card issuers and platforms have built the gateways that secure transactions using services like Apple Pay and Android Pay. For example, Mastercard Digital Enablement Service (MDES) is a secure payment system that has been built with ‘EMV-like cryptography’ to enable its cardholders to use Apple Pay, and ensure that transactions can take full advantage of the most advanced payment security in the world. “For consumers and retailers alike, that means that every purchase made with a Mastercard using Apple Pay will offer the security, benefits and guarantees of any Mastercard transaction, said Jason Lalor, country head of Mastercard Ireland. “Mastercard was first in the world to offer contactless and mobile payment solutions to consumers and in 2016 Irish consumers stepped up their adoption of such payments, increasing their contactless transactions over five-fold with Mastercard. “Apple Pay offers cardholders a safe and seamless payment experience that gives all the benefits and guarantees of any Mastercard transaction.” Eddie Dillon, director of Innovation at KBC Bank Ireland said that current account and credit card holders with an Apple iPhone SE, iPhone 6 and later and Apple Watch will be able to use Apple Pay everywhere contactless payments are accepted. “This development enhances our €100m multi-year investment plan in digital channels, banking systems and physical presence in Ireland,” said Dillon. Ulster Bank’s director of Customer Experience and Products Maeve McMahon said: “Customer-centric innovation is really important to Ulster Bank, and Apple Pay will make mobile payments even easier for our customers. “They will be able to pay for goods and services anywhere contactless payments are accepted, using their iPhone 6 or later or Apple Watch. We know from talking to them that they’re really excited about this announcement and that it’s an important part of our drive to be the number one bank for customer service, trust and advocacy.” Related: Apple, e-commerce, fintech, payments, Visa, MasterCard, Apple Watch, iPhone Editor John Kennedy is an award-winning technology journalist. editorial@siliconrepublic.com You May Also Like You May Also Like Companies Apple will soon have earned $1trn from iOS devices since 2007 12 Jan 201725 Shares Hiring Now Help us change the way money works Be part of a globally successful team Fidelity International: A truly unique proposition The largest employer in northwest Ireland Start-ups Irish brothers’ fintech start-up Stripe is now worth $9bn 25 Nov 2016386 Shares Enterprise The 6 seconds it takes to hack a Visa card is ‘frighteningly easy’ (updated) 2 Dec 201660 Shares SUBSCRIBE TO OUR E-ZINE Sign up to receive weekly alerts bringing the best of Siliconrepublic.com straight to your inbox.

As Darrell plots his next move, those heavyweights are starting to look more like competitors than partners. Darrell's goal: tying together TVs, appliances and voice-controlled devices -- an area many of the globe's biggest tech companies are trying to crack. "They want to be at the center of connected homes but you've got to sleep with one eye open" because erstwhile allies may well become rivals, said IDC analyst Jonathan Gaw. VIDEOS TOP JOBS Darrell insists the new strategy won't be a dramatic change from the way Logitech has long operated. Its keyboards, wireless mice, and neighborhood-rattling speakers have always fit into the larger PC market, and in newer, faster-growing categories, Darrell has sought to make his offerings work with those of tech giants. Logitech's UE Boom speakers understand Apple's Siri and Google Now, its remotes use Amazon's Alexa to control everything from TVs to lights and heating, and its accessories can turn iPads into mini-laptops. Even as he pushes deeper into the smart home, Darrell says Logitech can find niches that will be profitable without raising the ire of the industry's leaders. "There's no way these big players are going to want to be in every little puddle around their operating systems," says Darrell, 55, slouched in an Eames-inspired chair in Logitech's "Innovation Center" at the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne, a top Swiss technical university with long ties to the company. "We've always been in categories where the big players are." To fund that strategy, Darrell aims to wring maximum profits from his PC mouse and keyboard business, which racks up sales of almost $1 billion a year with gross margins approaching 50 percent. That will let him enter new areas such as voice-controlled devices, video collaboration, and augmented-reality games. Investors will get an outlook for the fiscal year that starts in April at a meeting with Logitech management March 7 in New York. Tavis McCourt, an analyst at Raymond James in Nashville, praises Darrell for turning around a company that was "really struggling to define what it was." McCourt says he expects Logitech to develop keyboards for internet-connected TVs and a device that might take voice commands for home automation, like Amazon's Echo and Google's Home. The big hitters have a massive advantage over Logitech, which has historically been better at commercializing others' inventions than developing its own. Logitech, whose revenue is forecast to reach $2.2 billion this year, devotes less than $150 million annually to research and development. Microsoft last year spent about $12 billion, Google $14 billion, and Amazon $16 billion. That could make it tough for Logitech to build products with enough sophistication to command premium prices, said Torsten Sauter, head of Swiss Research at broker Kepler Cheuvreux. "The smart home looks difficult" for Logitech to crack, Sauter said. "They have no software, no ecosystem. Logitech is much more a design company than a tech company." Darrell joined Logitech after four years at Whirlpool and stints at General Electric and Procter & Gamble, where he ran Braun, the German maker of high-design shavers and clocks. His predecessor had been ousted in 2011 after profit cuts and a $34 million writedown for the Revue, a keyboard for Google TV. Darrell says the company had lost its focus on design. "We had let our products slip and were just making black plastic," Darrell said. While revenue was largely flat in Darrel's first three years as he focused on cutting costs and shutting down or selling less-profitable businesses, retail sales this year are expected to grow at least 12 percent excluding currency fluctuations. More important, profit has more than tripled under Darrell. Darrell says he can succeed by stressing design and marketing to create hits like the UE Boom speakers, as well as novelties such as a "silent" mouse and a wireless dock for phones that lets users toggle between typing on their PC screen and smartphone. And Logitech has a long tradition of buying its way into new categories. The company in 2008 purchased Ultimate Ears, now its UE division, which represents 15 percent of Logitech's sales and is growing at 25 percent annually. Last year, Darrell paid $50 million for Jaybird, a Utah startup that makes wireless headphones for runners, and he agreed to buy Saitek, a maker of mock steering wheels and airplane sticks for gamers, for $13 million. » Next page...

Image: Youtube/Apple The service is now avaialble through two irish banks. Image: Youtube/Apple OVER TWO YEARS after it was first launched, Apple Pay is now available in Ireland. The cash-free payment system allows users to pay for goods by tapping their phone on a reader, much like they would using a contactless card. Apple Pay in Ireland is currently available for customers of KBC Bank and Ulster Bank and there is no charge per transaction on the service. The security of the service comes from the fact that your actual card numbers are not stored on the device and are therefore not transferred when you make a payment. Instead, you’re issued a Device Account Number that is encrypted and stored in your device. The only time your debit or credit card details are seen by Apple is when you’re entering it into your phone. It’s much like generating a new voucher for every transaction you make. Each one is for the specific transaction you make and even if it is intercepted, the token cannot be traced back to the buyer. You can also use Apple Pay to pay for goods and services in apps on your device. Source: Apple/YouTube You can begin using Apple Pay through the Wallet app on your Apple device. It is available on an iPhone 6 or later, iPhone SE, iPad Pro, iPad Air 2, iPad mini 3 or later and an Apple Watch paired to an iPhone 5 or later. Android Pay has also been available to Irish uses since December 2016.

International Business Times UK UK World Business Politics Fintech Technology Science Sport Entertainment Opinion Video Pictures Log out Newsletter Signup Technology Companies Steve Jobs initially thought the Genius Bar was 'idiotic', former Apple retail boss says 'You can call it the Geek Bar', Steve Jobs said at the time, former Apple retail chief Ron Johnson said. By Hyacinth Mascarenhas March 7, 2017 07:37 GMT Former Apple retail head Rob Johnson said Steve Jobs called the Genius Bar idea 'idiotic.'Justin Sullivan/Getty Images The Genius Bar may have become a mainstay at Apple stores across the globe, but Apple co-founder Steve Jobs was not too keen on the idea at first. In an interview with Recode, Apple's former retail chief Ron Johnson shed some light on his relationship with Steve Jobs, the creation of Apple stores and his pitch for the Genius Bar that Jobs called 'idiotic'. On Recode Decode, hosted by Kara Swisher, Johnson said he and Jobs "clicked from Day One." While he was interviewing for the job, Johnson said the Apple boss asked him to write down his ideas detailing how he would approach retail at the company. "He said to me, 'It's Thanksgiving weekend coming up. Why don't you write down what you would do? How would you approach retail? Tell me about it," Johnson said. "So I went back and I wrote this 10-page thesis of why Apple should do stores, what they should be like, blah blah blah." Johnson said he later got a call from Apple asking him to come back in. When he asked Jobs what he thought about his thesis, Jobs reportedly said, "Well, I didn't like it very much, but that's okay. Let's talk!'" "That's Steve. He offered me the job that day," Johnson said. "The central thesis was if Apple was going to do it, it had to be bold. It had to be something different." He explained that they decided to devote half the Apple store to service and training and make help center stage because "if someone is going to switch to Mac, they gotta know we stand behind it." "The entire purpose when someone comes into a store is to engage," he said. "They've got to talk to a person or get their hands on a product. Nothing else matters." Former Apple retail chief Rob Johnson reveals that Steve Jobs initially hated the idea of a Genius Bar at Apple stores.Claudio Villa/Getty Images He also spoke about his pitch to Jobs regarding a tech support station for every Apple store called the "Genius Bar" where customers can learn more about how to use their Apple products, take their devices in for tech support and hardware repairs. "I remember the day I came in and told Steve about the Genius Bar idea and he says, 'That's so idiotic! It'll never work!'" Johnson said. "He said, 'Ron, you might have the right idea, but here's the big gap: I've never met someone who knows technology who knows how to connect with people. They're all geeks!

Digital Trends Home > Computing > Google dominates K-12 education in the U.S. as… Google dominates K-12 education in the U.S. as Apple falls to third place By Mark Coppock — March 3, 2017 1:55 PM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Why it matters to you Your child is most likely to be using a Google Chromebook in the classroom lately, and least likely to use a Mac. It wasn’t that long ago that Apple was in first place in the United States education market, which the company had long pursued at least in part to expose students to Macs and increase the chances that they would continue to use Apple products later in life. Most recently, the iPad had a staggering share in education, as much as 94 percent of all tablets sold in education by some accounts. Now, that’s all changing. Between Microsoft’s efforts to target the educational market, and Google’s Chromebook initiative offering the lowest cost of entry, Apple has dropped to third place in the market, according to Futuresource Consulting. More: Get smart: The 25 best educational apps for iPhone and Android Futuresource looked at mobile PC sales in the U.S. K-12 sector, which achieved 18-percent year-over-year growth in 2016 with 12.6 million units sold. The biggest story is Google’s Chromebook, which grabbed 58 percent of the market in 2016. That’s an increase from 50 percent in 2015, based on affordability, G Suite productivity tools, lower device management costs, and other factors. On a worldwide basis, Chromebook’s penetration is significantly lower, at only 6 percent in 2016. Futuresoft Consulting Apple, on the other hand, saw its share of the market fall to 19 percent between iOS and MacOS devices. That’s down from 34 percent in 2014, and 25 percent in 2015. Globally, Apple’s share was at 11 percent in 2016, which is actually a slight increase from 2015’s share of 10 percent. Apple isn’t standing still, however, with a number of initiatives, including its Classroom app and education focus in iOS 9.3 leading the company’s efforts to turn things around. For Microsoft’s part, its various education-focused programs, including Microsoft Classroom, School Data Sync, and low-cost Windows 10 machines aimed squarely at Chromebook, have allowed the company to maintain its second-place position at 22 percent of the market in 2016. Worldwide, Microsoft is dominant in K-12 education, at 65 percent of the market. Newer initiatives, such as the rumored Windows 10 Cloud edition and Microsoft’s rollout of InTune for Education to help combat Google’s Management Console, are aimed at building the company’s share of education going forward. According to Futuresoft, the future of the education market is murky. “Microsoft has made huge strides in developing its education ecosystem offering in the past year, with major announcements on both the devices and platform side. To date, however, these developments have not stopped Google’s momentum within the U.S. K-12 market. Microsoft continues to face challenges to win back end-user mindshare.” The future of the education market will include expanding use of 2-in-1 devices, where Microsoft’s Windows 10 is a particularly strong player. Whether Apple, Microsoft, or Google will dominate is unclear, but one thing is obvious: The education market is important to each of the companies, and they’re going to be fighting tooth and nail for their share of the business.

A 3D sensor for the smartphone is in the works, and a fresh report sheds light on how the rumoured 3D camera or sensor may work. A Barclays report lists two methods for the 3D camera - Time of Flight (ToF) and Structured Light - and more on these two methods has been detailed below. Further, as has been reported in the past and recently reiterated, Apple is also expected to introduce OLED display panel in the iPhone 8, and keep the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus with LCD panels. However, a separate report claims that Apple may switch to OLED panels for all its iPhone variants by 2019. Apple iPhone 8 Specifications, Release Date, and More - Leaks and Rumours So Far The report by Barclays, obtained by Business Insider, claims that the 3D camera will work in two of the above mentioned ways. The ToF method will emit a signal at the object in front of it, and calculate the bounce off. Based on a series of bounces, the iPhone 8 will build a 3D image of the object in front of it. The second method called Structured Light projects a pattern (like a grid) onto the object in front of it, and then it distorts the object into pieces to calculate the shape of the object and make a 3D image accordingly. The 3D sensor is also earlier reported to bring facial recognition to the iPhone 8, in addition to an improved Touch ID for added security. This will work in the similar manner as the Apple Watch and MacBook Pro understanding to lock and unlock the laptop. Also, this 3D sensor could have multiple applications like building 3D game avatars or taking 3D selfies. Apple reportedly has 1,000 engineers in Israel working solely on augmented reality, as the company looks to bet big on AR, and not on VR. If this is true, something truly disruptive will hopefully be integrated into the iPhone 8 scheduled to release in September this year. A separate report from Patently Apple also cites a South Korean report to claim that by 2019, Apple aims to fully integrate OLED displays in all its iPhone variants, unlike this year where only the premium variant will sport the battery efficient display. "Apple is expected to adopt OLED for about 60 million units [...] and double the adoption next year. It aims to use OLED for all its new iPhones by 2019," the report states. The iPhone 8 is expected to sport an all-glass back, and an edge-to-edge display with a bottom touch-based 'function area' replacing the Home Button.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 7 March 2017 by Military News Apple announces environmental progress in China Lens Technology has committed to power all of its glass production for Apple with 100 percent renewable energy by the end of 2018, as part of Apple’s industry-leading supply chain clean energy program announced last year. Lens is the first supplier to make a clean energy commitment for all of its Apple production, and will meet its goal through an unprecedented power purchase agreement with local wind projects. Apple is working with suppliers to help transform the environmental landscape in China, and is proud to announce all 14 of its final assembly sites in China are now compliant with UL’s Zero Waste to Landfill validation. The UL standard certifies all of their manufacturing waste is reused, recycled, composted, or, when necessary, converted into energy. Since the program began in January 2015, the sites have diverted more than 140,000 metric tons of waste from landfills. “We want to show the world that you can manufacture responsibly and we’re working alongside our suppliers to help them lower their environmental impact in China,” said Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives. “We congratulate Lens for their bold step, and hope by sharing the lessons we’ve learned in our transition to renewable energy, our suppliers will continue to access clean power projects, moving China closer to its green manufacturing goals.” “Our power purchase agreement is the first of its kind in southern China and we hope it will serve as an example for other companies looking to transition to cleaner, more economical sources of power,” said Lens CEO Zhou Qunfei. “We’re pleased to be the first supplier to commit to covering all of our Apple production with renewable energy, and proud to source from local Hunan wind farms to power our facilities in Changsha.” Lens’ manufacturing with Apple currently includes two facilities in Changsha, Hunan province. Wind energy will cover 100 percent of the energy consumed producing Apple products at Lens facilities by 2018, avoiding nearly 450,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide each year, equivalent to the energy use in 380,000 Chinese homes.

According to the said report, the company is aiming to start production as early as 2019. This sparked rumors that 2019 iPhones could sport the latest 5nm ARM chips from TSMC. Now it would seem that not only 5nm ARM chips are a rage. Rumor has it that Apple is planning on implementing OLED displays on future iPhones as well. According to the Korean publication The Bell, Apple is considering doubling its OLED usage by 2018. Furthermore, this will be upgraded to full blown OLED usage by the following year. This means that all iPhone models coming from Apple in the next couple of years will sport OLED displays. The report also claimed that Samsung will be the primary supplier of the said displays for Apple. This report is somehow strange given Apple’s aversion to OLED displays. Furthermore, it has been reported earlier that Apple is investing heavily on a new display technology, the micro-LED. In fact, rumour has it that the upcoming Apple Watch Series 3 will be sporting such display. iPhone 8 concept by Deuxani (via forums.macrumors.com) The only reason why Apple will switch to an all OLED product by 2019 is that micro-LED mass production is still not viable. At the moment, no company can produce micro-LED panels that are big enough for a mobile device. That is why for the time being, the use is still limited to smart watches like the Apple Watch. Experts believe that Apple will only use the OLED as a platform before it switches to the micro-LED display. Micro-LED display technology is still quite juvenile in comparison to LCD and OLED. However, once the process has been perfected, micro-LED displays can offer higher efficiency compared to an OLED display. Furthermore, it is at least 30 times brighter and lasts a lot longer than OLED. This year, Apple reportedly ordered 80 million OLED panels for the upcoming iPhone 8. This makes up around 40 percent of Apple’s entire iPhone production for 2017. The company is aiming to sell around 200 million iPhone units in the last quarter of this fiscal year.

Even Warren Buffett loaded up on Apple shares. But is the tech stock a buy after its huge rise? Daniel Sparks (TMFDanielSparks) Mar 6, 2017 at 9:35PM Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock has seen a roaring comeback recently, with shares soaring about 28% in the past three months and hitting new all-time highs. At the time of this writing, shares are trading at about $139, well above their price of approximately $110 three months ago and significantly higher than the low $90s they hit last summer. With the stock trading so much higher recently, is it still a buy? This is a good question, particularly following legendary investor Warren Buffett's recent move to load up on Apple, making it Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE:BRK-B) (NYSE:BRK-A) second-largest equity holding. iPhone 7 Plus.Image source: Apple. Reasons for optimism Reinforced by Apple stock's 15% rise since its Jan. 31 first-quarter earnings release, investors seem pleased with the tech giant's performance recently. The recently ended quarter marked an important turning point for Apple as it returned to revenue growth, thanks primarily to a strong iPhone launch in September. The new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus models' popularity have helped the iPhone segment, which accounts for over 60% of total revenue, return to growth. Data source: Apple quarterly SEC filings. Chart by author. In its Dec. 31-ending holiday quarter, iPhone revenue and units increased 5% year over year as consumers bought up new iPhones. Apple sold 78.3 million iPhones, generating a record $54.4 billion in revenue for the segment, up from $51.6 billion in iPhone revenue in the year-ago quarter. The rise in revenue, combined with a $1.1 billion increase in its services revenue, helped Apple increase its total revenue 3% year over year. The return to growth was a promising sign for Apple's ability to move product. But signs to be bullish didn't end there. Apple also guided for a 2% to 6% year-over-year increase in revenue during its second quarter, suggesting the return to growth may be here to stick around. No longer the screaming buy it was But Apple's stock price appreciation accompanying its solid business performance recently means the stock isn't the solid buy it was. Indeed, even Buffett seems to be rethinking how attractive Apple stock is after its sharp increase recently. "I want to emphasize, we have not bought at this price. I mean, we quit buying when the earnings came out," Buffett said in a recent interview with CNBC. Importantly, Buffett was also careful to emphasize that Berkshire is "certainly not selling either." Putting Apple stock's soaring valuation into perspective, the rising stock price has pushed its price-to-earnings ratio from about 11 one year ago to nearly 17 today. AAPL P/E Ratio (TTM) data by YCharts. However, Apple's pricier valuation today shouldn't lead investors to immediately conclude the stock is no longer a buy. Apple stock still trades much more conservatively than many other companies. For instance, the average P/E ratio for stocks in the S&P 500 is 26. Combining Apple's conservative valuation with the company's recent growth, the stock is still a good long-term bet -- even at $139. But it's obviously not as good as a buy as it was around $100 a year ago or even at January's $120. Daniel Sparks owns shares of Apple.

US 30-year government bonds last yielded 2.964 percent. Like this story, share it with millions of investors on M3 Warren Buffett says Berkshire owns 133 mn shares of Apple: CNBC On 30-year US Treasury bonds, Buffett said: "It absolutely baffles me who buys the 30-year bond" and that doing so was not sensible at current yields. US 30-year government bonds last yielded 2.964 percent. Post Your Comments Share Cancel Warren Buffett, chairman and chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway Inc , told CNBC on Monday that his conglomerate had purchased "70 million plus" shares of Apple Inc in 2017 and that US stocks were not in "bubble territory." "Apple strikes me as having quite a sticky product and an enormously useful product to people that use it, not that I do," Buffett said. He said Berkshire's Apple stake, at 133 million shares, was worth about USD17 billion and amounted to Berkshire's second-biggest holding. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook had done a "terrific job," Buffett said, but added he had not bought shares since the company's earnings report. Berkshire revealed in its annual report on Saturday that its massive stake in Apple stock, as of Dec. 31, had risen to 61.2 million shares for a total of USD6.75 billion. Buffett, who told the cable television network that Berkshire had spent about USD20 billion on stocks since just before the Nov. 8 US election, also said the US stock market was cheap with interest rates at current levels. Benchmark 10-year US Treasury notes last yielded 2.333 percent in morning US trading. The billionaire investor said it was extremely difficult to attempt to find a floor in stock prices and that he did not know what would happen in the near term in the equity market. He said US shares could conceivably "go down 20 percent tomorrow." Buffett said Berkshire's positions in airlines remained unchanged. He said pricing shares of airlines has historically been a "very tough game" and he had never met the chief executives of the four airlines in which Berkshire holds stakes. Berkshire reported a USD9.3 billion airline stake at the end of Dec. 31, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings, with investments topping USD2.1 billion in each of American Airlines Group Inc , Delta Air Lines Inc , Southwest Airlines Co and United Continental Holdings Inc . Buffett, who was a vocal supporter of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, said he would judge US President Donald Trump based on how safe the country is in four years. He said he would also judge the Republican president according to how the US economy performs overall and how wide participation in a better economy extends. Despite his disagreement with some of Trump's policies, Buffett said the US economy would be better off in four years under any president. He said that US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson made "a lot of sense." On Kraft Heinz's snubbed bid for Unilever , Buffett said it was never intended to be a hostile offer and that there was not a "backup deal." Berkshire is a key investor in Kraft Heinz. "Will there be another deal at Kraft Heinz some day? My guess is yes, but who knows when, I mean, there’s no backup deal, and again, it would have to be friendly and frankly, the prices in that field make it very, very, very tough to make an intelligent deal." Asked about Berkshire's USD86 billion cash pile, he said the conglomerate was "always looking" for acquisitions but that there was "nothing close." Buffett said it was enormously important for the US economy to have 30-year government-guaranteed mortgages, but that mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were not necessary in order to accomplish that. On 30-year US Treasury bonds, Buffett said: "It absolutely baffles me who buys the 30-year bond" and that doing so was not sensible at current yields. US 30-year government bonds <US30YT=RR> last yielded 2.964 percent. Buffett reiterated that Americans are better off buying plain-vanilla index funds than committing money to active managers. He added that the hedge fund industry's standard fee structure of 2 percent of assets and 20 percent of investment gains "borders on obscene." In an annual letter to shareholders on Saturday, Buffett slammed fee-hungry investment managers: "When trillions of dollars are managed by Wall Streeters charging high fees, it will usually be the managers who reap outsized profits, not the clients." Buffett praised Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos as possibly the best manager he had ever seen and said Berkshire "missed big time" by not purchasing Amazon shares early on. Buffett said the US economy was doing "terrific," even at just 2 percent growth per year. Tags  Warren Buffett Apple Buy, Hold, Sell ?

But when it's released later this year, it might be literally very, very big. The iPhone 8 could feature a 5.8-inch OLED display. Credit: Tech Driven Times/YouTube The iPhone 8 could feature a 5.8-inch OLED display. Credit: Tech Driven Times/YouTubeMore Apple is planning a 5.8-inch screen size for its upcoming iPhone 8, Japan-based news outlet Nikkei is reporting, citing sources who claim to have knowledge of the company's plans. the screen size will complement the 4.7-inch iPhone 7s and 5.5-inch iPhone 7s Plus, according to the report. What's more, the Nikkei is reporting that Apple's iPhone 8 screen will indeed come with a curved design and use OLED technology, rather than the LCD Apple has relied upon for all previous iPhone displays. Apple's iPhone turns ten years old this year, and that has prompted the company to look for new ways to expand its iPhone line and deliver a major update in 2017, according to several reports. Apple is said to be working on a device that could come with an all-glass design and the aforementioned curved display. There's also a good chance that the device will support wireless charging. MORE: 29 Hidden iOS 10 Features You Need to Try All of those features, however, will come at a cost. According to some reports, Apple's iPhone 8 could cost $1,000 or more when it's made available later this year. Exactly how the bigger screen in the iPhone 8 might actually work, however, remains to be seen. Several reports have said that Apple is planning a "function area" as part of the screen, so you'll be able to control the device through the touch display. That function area could be where Apple houses its Touch ID fingerprint sensor and home button. The function area could reduce the amount of usable screen real estate when you're using the rumored function area, but we suspect the iPhone 8 would go into full-screen mode when watching movies and playing games. The iPhone 8 is expected to go on sale in September.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Tuesday, 7 March 2017 | MYT 10:00 AM This startup wants to bring AR to the iPhone before Apple does by janko roettgers Dare to dream: Occipital believes it can beat Apple to market, and is now gearing up to sell an augmented reality (AR) headset for Apple's iPhone next month. — Reuters LOS ANGELES: Apple may have up to 1,000 engineers working on augmented reality, if estimates from UBS analyst Steven Milunovich are correct. San Francisco-based computer vision startup Occipital is comparably scrappy.  But the company nonetheless believes it can beat Apple to market, and is now gearing up to sell an augmented reality (AR) headset for Apple's iPhone next month.  Bridge, as the headset is being called combines recent–generation iPhones with a Gear VR-like headset and a depth sensor capable of scanning rooms and incorporating real-world obstacles into mixed-reality applications.  The headset makes use of the iPhone's camera for a live video feed of the environment, which is enhanced through the addition of a wide-angle lens. In the headset, users then get to see that live camera image overlaid with virtual objects.  During a demo at the Game Developer Conference in San Francisco, Occipital showed off an app that made it possible to play fetch with a small robot dog, complete with balls bouncing off real-world walls and tables. Users could also place virtual furniture in the room, and rearrange it to see how a chair would look like at a certain spot.  Occipital has been working on a variety of computer vision applications since 2008, and introduced its own 3D depth sensor in 2013. In December, it first introduced Bridge to some 600 developers, giving them a way to build augmented reality apps.  In April, the company will begin to sell the headset to consumers over its website, and its VP of marketing Adam Rodnitzky told Variety this week that it eventually wants to make it available through retail stores as well.  There are reasons to doubt that the Bridge headset will become a break-through success. For one, there is the premium price tag: Consumers will have to pay $399 for the headset, which is a steep order for an unproven technology, especially when other mobile VR headsets are a lot cheaper.  The bigger issue is that at the end of the day, Occipital still only is a 40-person startup. Not only is this dwarfed by Apple's rumoured AR engineering army, developers are also much more likely to work for efforts like Google's Tango AR platform or Microsoft's Windows Mixed Reality initiative, simply because these big companies have a better track record catering to millions of consumers.  These issues are not lost to Occipital. That's why the company is already working on a new generation of its sensors, to be directly integrated into VR or AR headsets. Rodnitzky said that Occipital's tech may never get picked up by the likes of Apple, but he seemed optimistic that other major phone makers could be willing to license its technology in order to stay competitive – and maybe even beat Apple to the punch once more. — Reuters Related Stories You May Be Interested Malaysian shuttlers safe after an eventful flight to Birmingham Pyongyang bans Malaysians from leaving N.

Funston, managing partner of Funston Advisory Services, believes that major shifts are happening very quickly in the HD aftermarket ecosystem. “Some industries I go to, well, the writing is starting to emerge,” he said. “Here, it’s kind of written in neon. You’ve got the opportunity now to look at your business models and you’ve got time to change. But the opportunity is fleeting. Will you actually have the tools and leadership to actually make those changes?” In his presentation, “Shift Happens! How to Think Like Steve Jobs and Be a Shift Disturber in the HD Aftermarket,” Funston said executives in this industry need a proactive strategy about how to create better value, products, profit, and leadership. They will have to react very fast to shifts because velocity matters. “There’s an old Japanese saying that when you’re dying of thirst, it’s too late to start digging a well,” he said. “So the kinds of changes you need to start thinking about for your business model, you need to start thinking about them and start planting the seeds for the business model to be successful. It’s going to take some risks. There will be failures. But the question is, how quickly can you recognize that it’s not working and move to something else?” So what signals a shift? What’s real? What’s not real? He said one of the characteristics of intelligence is having recognition. “So how fast can you see the shift emerging?” he said. “There are requisite conditions. If you think about, for example, HD TVs, when they first came out, they had the technical capability but there wasn’t programming and broadcast capability. Once you had the combination of a product capable of displaying it, the ability to broadcast, and the programming to go with it, then it would take off. So you have to be thinking about what needs to be in place in order for this shift to really start to be commercially viable. “So be a shift disturber. When industry life or death assumptions change, who will be the first to know? Who will be the first to develop and execute a superior business model? It requires exceptional leadership and vision. Most people, when they look at their business model, look for signs that confirm what they believe to be the case. Who will be the first among you to develop and execute a superior business model? How do you attack the weakness in the market? That’s going to require exceptional leadership and vision.” His shift disturbers’ motto: Do unto others before they do it to you! You’re probably not going to turn out to be a clone of Steve Jobs. But it’s not impossible to at least think like he did. Funston said Jobs was probably the key shift disturber at Apple. He said Jobs returned to Apple in 1997, the year that signaled the end of Microsoft’s dominance in the market. Apple had lost $1 billion in 1996, its market share had fallen from 16% to 4% and its stock price had fallen from $70 to $14 90 days from bankruptcy. By 2012, Apple had become the #1 market cap. So what happened? What did Jobs do?   Do the opposite Funston said Job’s philosophy was to “think different” and view his workers as pirates, even going so far as to actually fly a pirate flag over headquarters. They were hippies who would change the world. They would control the entire experience—it was about integrated devices and software (not PCs), and by 2007 Apple dropped computer from its name. It was all about being mobile, touch rather than type, a closed system. It featured a concentric hierarchy where everything about the organization was decided by Jobs. “He did the exact opposite of whatever the alpha business model was at that time,” Funston said. “Forces of ‘creative destruction’ are always at work. Sooner or later, the industry-leading business model will be replaced—and typically by its exact opposite. Will you see it coming? Will you be prepared? Will you survive and thrive in that environment? Will you have your shift together? Will you be a shift disturber? Will you be the Steve Jobs of the HD aftermarket?”   Disrupting alliances Funston quoted Sun Tzu, a Chinese general and philosopher who is credited with writing The Art of War: “The acme of military strategy is to attack the enemy’s plans, next is to disrupt their alliances, third is to attack their army, and worst of all is to attack their fortified cities.” Funston said that when waging business model warfare: • An alpha leader’s business model is known. Attack the weakness of sameness with something different. • Think the unthinkable—out of the box. • Be simple, but not simplistic. • If you are the alpha, do it yourself or have others do it to you.   What distributors expect To get an idea of what people in the industry are thinking, he conducted a survey last year involving 77 companies in the HD aftermarket: 38 distributors, 16% of them with more than $100 million in sales, 47% with more than 100 employees; and 39 suppliers, 56% with more than $100 million in sales, 68% with more than 100 employees. Here’s what the survey found: • On shifts in the competitive ecosystem: 97% of suppliers believe that customers will merge and consolidate, compared to just 65% of distributors. Other than that, they were in near agreement that: smaller distributors will continue to be rolled up into larger groups; continuing regulatory change (emissions/autonomous vehicles) will increase costs; vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure technologies will bring new competitors to the aftermarket; competition between suppliers and customers will increase; channel competition will increase as OEMs and their dealers increasingly emphasize parts and service; telematics will create a big change in the future; and most suppliers will go direct to customer and bypass distributors.   Vertical integration “Distributors are saying that traditional distribution channels are blurring, that technology is at the OEM now, and not an aftermarket item, that OEMs already are gaining market share, telematics is the next OEM-dominant position, some suppliers will sell direct, which opens the floodgates. The Internet is offering reduced service at a lower cost and tech-savvy distribution channels will be an alternate source of components. “Suppliers are saying that all participants will have to prove their value—it just can’t be a commodity. There is efficiency in the supply chain that will be an ongoing focus. Keep up with technology or you lose. ‘White box’ high-tech products will change the market structure. ‘All Makes’ programs will compete in the aftermarket. Telematics require humans to interpret and act upon the resulting data. At the current time, the HD industry doesn’t have the human brain power to make use of telematics on a wide basis.”   Do we need e-commerce? • On shifts in products and services: 66% of distributors believe that to deal with change, distributors must be willing to acquire and invest in tooling, compared to just 34% of suppliers. There was near agreement on the need for eCommerce and inventory management. “There is increased durability and longer replacement cycles,” he said. “There are imported knock-offs, with quality improving or equal, and channel conflicts, with distributor consolidation, direct supplier to customer—bypassing distribution—and online sales. You’ve got rising costs of inventory and asset management, obsolescence, and the need to have inventory to quickly satisfy fleet needs.” • On shifts in the profit system: Both were vehement that success in the HD aftermarket will require that they provide the highest value added (97% of distributors and 92% of suppliers); 89% of distributors and 73% of suppliers say it will require that they prevent margin erosion. “There is margin erosion, especially if you’re competing on price only, and supply chain/inventory management challenges with parts proliferation,” he said. “You’ve got the cost of keeping up with technology and obsolescence. In pricing, there are battles with the Internet, dealers, and overseas knockoffs.   What difference does price make? “Distributors are saying they need the inventory—price doesn’t matter if you don’t have it. Accounts where only pricing matters are typically not very profitable. They’re saying they make their biggest profit on obsolete parts and need to be more proactive promoting the value of parts availability and service they provide. They must push technology boundaries—be part of it, not a bystander. “Suppliers are saying price is a consideration, but technology is the goal for their products. Depending on the product line, some will command a premium, and others will become increasingly commoditized. Uptime and cost per mile drives the fleets. If you don’t contribute to improvement in that, you are going to be replaced. Lower cost is dependent upon the area and the number of competitors. There is also online ordering.” • On the value proposition: Only 48% of distributors and 41% of suppliers believe they will increasingly have to compete primarily on the basis of price; 92% of distributors and suppliers say they need to develop a group of customers who see the value of doing business with them.   Who is more important? “Suppliers are valuing the OEM dealerships over the aftermarket,” he said. “Distributors need an aggressive market strategy and value-added programs. They have to modernize the industry, make it more relevant, sell the benefits they bring to a customer, build brand equity. They must expand their product portfolio beyond commodity products. “There’s always going to be a tradeoff between value and quality and price. The challenge is, where are you going to position yourself? If you’re simply positioned base on price, that’s a losing proposition. That’s going to result in margin erosion.” • On shifts in leadership, vision and strategy organization: 100% of suppliers and 95% of distributors believe distributors will need to develop their leadership capacity to respond to the rate and magnitude of change. “They’ll have to train and develop people and the next generation. How do you do that? How do you transfer the knowledge from the existing aging staff to the next generation? One is standard operating procedures. The other one is proximity to a local college for training and retraining. Then you’re also going to need succession planning. Who’s going to take your place? How are they going to carry it on and what kind of business model do you need to be successful?”  ♦   Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

By KI MAE HEUSSNER Oct. 15, 2010 0 Shares Email Star PlayABCNEWS.com WATCH Steve Jobs Takes a Second Medical Leave 0 Shares Email The iMac, the iPod, the iPhone -- Apple CEO Steve Jobs is famous for his growing list of technological wonders. But what's the secret behind his Midas touch? The elusive CEO likely won't tell you himself. But in an exclusive interview with the popular tech blog Cult of Mac, former Apple CEO John Sculley reveals a few secrets. Play null Jobs co-founded Apple Computer Inc. in his parent's garage in 1976, so the story goes, and in 1983 convinced then Pepsi Co. executive John Sculley to join Apple as its CEO. But two years later, after differences over how to run Apple, Sculley pushed Jobs out of the company he helped to create. In his interview with Cult of Mac, Sculley says Jobs won't talk to him. Despite the strained relationship, Sculley still describes Jobs as a visionary leader. Play null "He felt that the computer was going to change the world, and it was going to become what he called 'the bicycle for the mind.' It would enable individuals to have this incredible capability that they never dreamed of before," he says. "He was a person of huge vision. But he was also a person that believed in the precise detail of every step. He was methodical and careful about everything -- a perfectionist to the end." Sculley also says that one of the things that made Jobs stand out among others was his focus on minimalism. "He always believed the most important decisions you make are not the things you do, but the things you decide not to do," Sculley says, recounting a visit to Jobs' house in which he noticed it contained only a picture of Einstein, a Tiffany lamp, a chair and a bed. Play null Many have attributed Apple's success to Jobs' relentless pursuit of user-friendly gadgets, and Sculley confirmed that was a hallmark of his style early on. Sculley: Jobs Differs From Rivals Because of Commitment to Perfection "He always looked at things from the perspective of what was the user's experience going to be. But unlike a lot of people in product marketing in those days, who would go out and do consumer testing, asking people, 'What did they want?' Steve didn't believe in that," Sculley says. "He believed that showing someone a calculator, for example, would not give them any indication as to where the computer was going to go because it was just too big a leap." Play null Jobs is famous for his eye for beautiful design, but Sculley says he also had a knack for recruiting the best people and believed in reaching out to those he wanted on his team. But added that what made Jobs different from his rivals was his commitment to perfection. In Sculley's interview with Cult of Mac, he goes into detail about his relationship with Jobs and Apple's strategy over the years.

For example over in Australia, Apple is still struggling to get some of the major banks to come to an agreement. That being said if you are living in Ireland or if you do plan to travel to Ireland, an exclusive report from 9to5Mac has revealed that Apple Pay is expected to be launched in the region tomorrow. Interestingly enough this is the first we’ve heard of this, despite the fact that there has been evidence that Apple could be gearing up to launch in countries such as Taiwan, Germany, and Italy. The report goes on to add that there will be at least two banks that will be supporting Apple Pay at launch and they are Ulster Bank and KBC, both of whom are multinational banks and have supported Apple Pay in other countries that they operate in. At the moment only these two banks have been mentioned, but it is unclear if the country’s other major and bigger banks such as Bank of Ireland and AIB will be coming on board as well. It has been noted that AIB does support Android Pay, but we’re not sure if because of this there might be a conflict, or if it could be a good sign as the bank does appear to be supporting mobile payments. Take it with a grain of salt, but if it is true then we should find out the details shortly. Filed in Apple >Cellphones. Read more about apple pay.

Picture: Leon Neal/Getty Images Nick Whighamnews.com.au@NWWHIGHAM KNOWN as “geniuses”, the blue T-shirt-wearing staff at Apple stores have become synonymous with the brand. But the Genius Bar which has become a hallmark of the company’s brick and mortar stores was once hated by Apple’s co-founder Steve Jobs who thought it was an “idiotic” idea. Jobs was notorious for his short temper and didn’t hesitate to tell those around him if he hated their ideas — and that’s exactly what he did to Ron Johnson, the man he hired in 2000 to create and pioneer Apple’s first retail stores. Jobs asked Johnson to go away one weekend and write down his vision. Speaking to Kara Swisher on her Recode Decode podcast, the 58-year-old retail guru detailed how Jobs responded to his initial suggestions for the store, including a ‘Genius Bar’ where customers could take instructional courses on how to use their Apple devices. “So I went back and I wrote this 10-page thesis of why Apple should do stores, what they should be like,” Johnson recalled. The idea was to mimic friendly bartenders who, instead of dispensing cocktails, could dispense any product advice customers needed. However in a seemingly rare case of misjudgment, Jobs envisioned one major problem with the concept. “I remember the day I came in and told Steve about the Genius Bar idea and he says, ‘That’s so idiotic! It’ll never work!’,” Johnson said. “He said, ‘Ron, you might have the right idea, but here’s the big gap: I’ve never met someone who knows technology who knows how to connect with people. They’re all geeks! You can call it the Geek Bar’. “And I said, ‘Steve, kids who are in their 20s today grew up in a very different world. They all know technology, and that’s who’s going to work in the store’.” Of course, the Genius Bar remains arguably the central feature of Apple’s shopfronts and has been hailed as a major success for the company. “It turned out to be great,” Johnson admitted. Since the passing of its notorious co-founder in 2011, Apple has had to deal with growing criticism that it has lost its innovative touch — something the tech giant will be hoping to dispel with the release of its next generation iPhone. Apple fans are eagerly awaiting the impending iPhone 8 which marks the 10 year anniversary of the company’s flagship device. But they may have to wait just a little longer than expected as rumours are circulating this week that the launch could be pushed back slightly beyond September, the month Apple usually holds it big annual product launch. According to unconfirmed reports, due to a redesign of a finger print scanner on the new iPhone — widely expected to have an OLED screen — the launch could be pushed back to sometime in October.

Windows convertible tablets accounted for over a quarter of all mobile tablet devices sold in Australia during the second half of 2016. Tablets sales had been experiencing an extended slowdown but the market actually grew by 2% in the latter half of last year. The second half of 2016 saw 1.64 million mobile tablet units sold in Australia, according to analyst firm Telsyte's Australian Digital Consumer Study 2017. While Apple's iPad family accounted for 44% of the sales, Windows took 27% of the sales market share. Android is still ahead of Windows at 29%, but the latter's performance is more impressive; local sales of Windows tablets grew around 60% year-on-year. Meanwhile, Android tablet and iPad sales declined 13%, and 9% respectively over the same period. 2-in1s are defined as "laptops that have a touch screen and detachable keyboards or foldable form factor to provide a pure tablet-like experience". This includes Microsoft Surface tablets, iPad Pro and Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro S. Android tablets would have had more of an edge if the Australian market hasn't lost its appetite for budget tablets, most of which run a variant of Google's mobile operating system. According to Telsyte: "[A]round 40% of Australians are willing to pay more for ‘top quality electronics’ as digital devices become central to the consumer lifestyle." Microsoft's Move To Woo Creative Professionals Paying Off "Tablets are no longer just about media consumption, touchscreen devices are revolutionising the creative experience," Telsyte Managing Director, Foad Fadaghi, said. This is probably one of the reasons why Microsoft Surface tablets are gaining favour given the range was heavily marketed towards creative professionals. In fact, Microsoft has really made a push into currying favour with the creative industry, which has traditionally been the realm of Apple. Last year it announced the Surface Studio, which bears a striking resemblance to Apple's iMac line, a popular desktop computer for creative professionals. The iMac line hasn't seen a major upgrade since 2015. According to Telsyte: Telsyte expects the introduction of larger format, desktop touch computers, such as Microsoft’s Surface Studio to boost an otherwise sluggish PC market which has struggled to give users a reason to upgrade. Telsyte estimates that the average replacement cycle for PCs in Australia has now grown to 4.7 years. Telsyte believes Microsoft and its OEM partners will cater for different segments of this bourgeoning market developing both tabletop and desktop touch interfaces using Windows 10 in various form factors.

I work on big screens, at a big desk. If anyone wants to target me as a customer, they need to start with a head-up display that emulates a 4K screen, size 55 inch, at a distance of about 1.5 - 2 metres.

Chris Jager 06 Mar 2017 1:30 PM Dear Lifehacker, I've been a smoker since I was 14. I'm now 22 and I consider myself to be smoking hot (pun intended). I've heard that smoking cigarettes can age you prematurely. However, judging by the before-and-after photos I've seen, most of these people were pretty rough to begin with! Will smoking really ruin my good looks, or will I just go from a 9 to an 8.5? (I whiten my teeth professionally, so that's not a problem.)

A Lake County law enforcement official said the spate of recent arrests of out-of-state residents at Deer Park may just be the result of good police work — not because alleged crooks are targeting that particular store. Zavonnti Glasker | Lake County sheriff’s office photo Sterling L. Kimbrough and Zavonnti Glasker are the latest charged in an ongoing investigation. They are among 12 other arrests made in 2016 and earlier this year, several at the Deer Park location, from New York or Michigan, linked to the regional scheme, the sheriff’s office said. Sterling L. Kimbrough | Lake County sheriff’s office photo Two men who were arrested last week in Deer Park had more than 100 iPhones with them, the sheriff’s office said. Mohammed Hosein, 23 and Wen Jie Qin, 21 were stopped Wednesday by sheriff deputies near Deer Park Town Center. They had just left the Apple Store after exchanging stolen, damaged iPhones for new ones, the sheriff’s office said. Mohammed Hosein | Lake County sheriff’s office photo Here’s how the scam works, according to Sheriff’s Detective Christopher Covelli: The men go into Apple stores with phones that are either cracked or super glued together, preventing employees from opening up the phones to confirm serial numbers. Wen Jie Qin | Lake County sheriff’s office photo They claim they own the phones, and use false documents and stolen identity info to apparently prove it, Covelli said. The men then exchange the broken phones for a new one under warranty and leave with a new phone they are able to re-sell. Kimbrough, 21 and Glasker, 22, both of Detroit, Michigan, were both charged Monday with burglary and two counts of identity theft, all felonies, according to the Lake County sheriff’s office. At 7:15 p.m. Saturday, deputies responded to a report of two people trying to fraudulently open Apple accounts and obtain merchandise at the north suburban store, according to the sheriff’s office. Kimbrough and Glasker were opening accounts using other people’s identification, such as their Social Security numbers, to purchase new Apple products, the sheriff’s office said. They are both being held at the Lake County Jail on $150,000 bonds, and are next scheduled to appear in court Wednesday. In the earlier arrests, investigators determined that Hosein, of Detroit; and Qin, who lives in San Francisco, traveled to Apple stores across the county and “fraudulently obtained possession of numerous Apple iPhones,” according to the sheriff’s office. Hosein and Qin and were charged with one count each of burglary and retail theft, both felonies, and were each ordered held on $50,000 bonds. These kinds of fraudulent purchases are happening all across the country, but Covelli said the Lake County’s sheriff’s office has been keeping a close eye on the Deer Park store. Those increased efforts have led to the recent increase in arrests tied to the store; it may not mean that this store is for some reason being targeted, he added. The sheriff’s office continues to provide increased patrols at the store. # Crime Mohammed Hosein Deer Park Previously from Chicago News Man cleared of double murder takes cops, prosecutors to trial – Chicago Sun-Times Gangs reap guns from trains in violent Chicago neighborhoods Synagogue hate crime suspect an educated, suburban accountant Chance the Rapper miffed, Bruce the Governor pitches TIF – Chicago Sun-Times Stories from around the web you may like Currently Trending dear abby Dear Abby: Guy won't like me once he sees me chicago news Synagogue hate crime suspect an educated, suburban accountant chicago Gangs reap guns from trains in violent Chicago neighborhoods chicago Man cleared of double murder takes cops, prosecutors to trial – Chicago Sun-Times chicago news 9 children found living in squalor in Englewood home hospitalized CAPTION Post to Cancel
Home Economy Good news for startups in India: Secretary DIPP Ramesh Abhishek says ‘Fund flow to get a boost soon’ Good news for startups in India: Secretary DIPP Ramesh Abhishek says ‘Fund flow to get a boost soon’ The government is changing certain rules for the fund of funds announced last year to make it more attractive for venture funds to invest, and start-ups could see a dramatic rise in fund flow, as the teething trouble will be over soon. By: Banikinkar Pattanayak | New Delhi | Published: March 7, 2017 6:24 AM The government is changing certain rules for the fund of funds announced last year to make it more attractive for venture funds to invest, and start-ups could see a dramatic rise in fund flow, as the teething trouble will be over soon. (Reuters) The government is changing certain rules for the fund of funds announced last year to make it more attractive for venture funds to invest, and start-ups could see a dramatic rise in fund flow, as the teething trouble will be over soon. In an interview to FE’s Surbhi Prasad and Banikinkar Pattanayak, department of industrial policy and promotion (DIPP) secretary Ramesh Abhishek said the government is working out a mechanism to replace the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) and that administrative departments should ideally get to approve FDI proposals. Excerpts… The Budget 2017-18 has envisaged a greater liberalisation in India’s FDI regime. Which are the sectors are you looking at to further ease FDI rules? Nothing has been decided yet. We have already liberalised a lot. The idea to go for further easing to attract even more foreign investments has always been there. Even the FIPB will now have to be dismantled (as suggested in the Budget) for which a mechanism is being worked out. So which sectors will see further reforms will be decided after comprehensive discussions with various departments. Who will approve FDI proposals once the FIPB is dismantled—sectoral regulators or administrative departments? This is being discussed but ideally any approval that is supposed to come from the government should come from the government, and not regulators. The work of the regulator has already been laid down in the law and they can’t go beyond the ambit of the law. Also, if the approval isn’t going to come from an inter-ministerial body like the FIPB any more, it won’t come from another body as well, because replacing one body with another isn’t going to result in further ease of doing business. In such a case, ideally, the approval could be given by the administrative departments concerned. However, the government is yet to finalise a mechanism. Also Watch: What will be the role of the DIPP once the FIPB ceases to exist? See, there has to be a central mechanism (DIPP) to receive all applications online. It should then send those applications to relevant departments for necessary inputs and action. So one such centralised mechanism has to be there. Has the government decided on the concessions being sought by Apple to start manufacturing here? Apple has asked for some concessions, many of which relate to tax policies and a few other things. Earlier, we had met the departments concerned and they haven’t yet come back to us with their comments. We will have meetings soon and I will remind them to give their response. Four departments — revenue, electronics and information technology, commerce and environment — will provide us with their inputs on Apple’s demands. Have Apple executives met you again after the inter-ministerial panel meeting on January 26? We are always open to meeting potential investors. So they (Apple executives) also keep coming and we keep meeting them. How much of funds have so far been released from the fund of funds, which has a corpus of R10,000 crore, to start-ups? It’s important to note that this fund of funds will be covered in two finance commission cycles (through 2025). So roughly, it comes to around R1,100 crore per year. In the first year (2016-17), R600 crore is being given (to SIDBI which is to manage it). So far, we (SIDBI) have committed R129 crore. See, the government isn’t funding any start-up directly. It is a fund of funds. We are taking equities in other funds which are selecting start-ups (for investments). There is an investment committee that recommends and SIDBI decides on putting in money. Until now, the venture capital (VC) funds (that put in money, along with SIDBI, to set up the fund of funds) are mandated to invest the money only in start-ups. Market participants told us that the investors are not ready to put all their money in start-ups (SIDBI usually contributes around 15% of the fund and the rest comes from VC funds). So what we now propose is that whatever is the contribution of SIDBI to the fund, at least double of that amount must go to start-ups (from that fund). So if we invest, say R600 crore in a fund, at least R1,200 crore must go to start-ups ( to cut risks, the rest can go to firms that are at a more mature stage). So SIDBI has already selected about 15 funds with a corpus of R6,800 crore, and they are ready to commit and sanction if this new rule is implemented. Moreover, we have asked SIDBI to take up to 35% of equity in a fund. Currently, it offers funds (in lieu of equity) to the tune of only 15-20%. We have suggested that SIDBI give more funds because other investors are finding it difficult to arrange so much of funds from the market. Market participants have told us that SIDBI’s processes are too long, so we have asked it to fast-track its processes. All these steps will be over this month after which we expect significant improvement in the commitment as well as disbursement of funds. Please Wait while comments are loading...

Here's why. We aren't the world. The most talked-about brands of Mobile World Congress are almost entirely irrelevant to Americans. Some of that doesn't matter, but the reasons for it are worth talking about. During the world's biggest mobile conference, everybody was super excited about the Nokia 3310. I found the whole hullaballoo perplexing. But circa 2000, everybody in the UK owned this phone, and they have a lot of emotional attachment to it. In the US, Nokia—the most talked-about brand at MWC, according to Brandwatch—has been an an irrelevant failure for a decade. The second most talked-about brand at the show, Huawei, is the world's largest infrastructure provider and the No. 3 global handset provider. But Huawei sells almost no phones in the United States. Our Market Is Weird First, let's establish that phone brands in the US market are different from everywhere else in the world. Samsung and Apple dominate in the US and overseas. But Counterpoint Research shows LG, ZTE, and Alcatel rounding out the top five. A report with unlocked phones would also put Blu on the list. Look at IDC's global mobile phone tracker and you see Apple and Samsung, followed by Huawei, Oppo, and Vivo, none of which sell many products in the US. Skip over to Europe, and Kantar Worldpanel says Samsung and Apple lead, followed by Huawei or Wiko in different countries. On the floor at Mobile World Congress, I saw a ton of different brands we never get in the US. There were Vestel and General Mobile from Turkey, Noa from Croatia, and Gionee from China (above). Mobile phones are a much more regional industry than PCs. But what about Nokia and Huawei specifically? They're both reminders of specific ways America is keeping it weird. Our Carriers Are Weird If you want to play in the US, you have to play the carrier game. Nokia has been really bad at that. It alienated our carriers 10 years ago by refusing to make customized phones for each carrier. In its Windows Phone days, it made a bunch of unwise exclusivity deals with AT&T, which buried its phones after a short promotional period. The company isn't interested in making phones that use the oddball CDMA standard that Verizon and Sprint need, which eliminates more than half the country as potential customers. The 3310 phone isn't compatible with any US networksat all, so it's a total doorstop here. Nokia has zero relevance, from sea to shining sea. It's a European nostalgia brand making some nondescript low-cost Android phones and hoping to play on emotional resonances that Americans just lack. For a Nokia to win here, it would need to plant a foot on our shores, listen to what our carriers want, and build phones that conform to their needs. HMD Global Oy, the Finnish licensee of the Nokia brand, isn't about to do that. So Nokia will remain a foreign curiosity. Our Politics Are Weird There's a more sinister reason for Huawei's limited presence in the US market. If you live here, it's hard to understand what a big deal Huawei has become in the rest of the world. Seriously, it's huge in every country other than ours, as its packed MWC press conference demonstrated. But Huawei can't make any headway with US carriers because it's seen as the agent of an enemy state. Since 2013, Congress has treated Huawei's network equipment as a kind of Trojan horse, a potential way for the Chinese government to gain access to and manipulate US networks. (Huawei says that's ridiculous.) That controversy hasn't extended to Huawei's smartphones, but the US carriers, which control about 88 percent of sales here, seem to have shied away because why go chasing trouble? Related ZTE's 'Gigabit Phone' Exists, Is Gigabit ZTE's 'Gigabit Phone' Exists, Is Gigabit Huawei's curse doesn't seem to have extended to other Chinese smartphone makers, as ZTE and TCL-Alcatel—both Chinese—are doing quite well here, even though ZTE's networks division is also locked out of our market. That may be because ZTE and Alcatel have spent years building autonomous, US-based organizations able to make decisions on their own, while Huawei remained much more centrally controlled. For Huawei to win here, it has to shake off its Chinese identity and convince our government that it's a global, multinational company with a strong American subsidiary. This is entirely possible (as ZTE has shown) but Huawei hasn't devoted a lot of resources to this approach. I'd give Huawei more of a chance of succeeding here than Nokia. But neither will be a big deal here any time soon even though they had lots of buzz in Barcelona. Back to top Previous : Is the Smartphone Already Obsolete?

The move comes as we’re also expecting a launch sooner rather than later in Taiwan. Apple Pay allows users to complete transactions in-person, online, and in-app with their iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, or Mac. In Ireland, Apple Pay will be supported by UlsterBank and KBC, both of which are multinational and have supported Apple Pay in other countries for some time now.  Bank of Ireland and AIB are the biggest banks in Ireland with the latter supporting Android Pay. We could not confirm Apple Pay will be supported at these banks at launch or any of Ireland’s other banks. Cork, Ireland is Apple’s European Headquarters and the company is involved in significant tax disputes with Irish and EU tax rules at the center of the controversy. Ireland is the latest country to gain support for Apple Pay. Most recently, the mobile payments platform has continued to expand in countries like the United States and Australia. Apple Pay lets you make purchases in supported stores using your iPhone or Apple Watch. Apple Pay can also be used to make purchases in supported apps on iPhone and iPad. Here’s how to set up Apple Pay if your bank is supported (full list): On the iPhone, just head to the Wallet app on iOS 9 or later and tap the plus (+) icon in the top right corner to begin, then follow the prompts. To add a debit card to the Apple Watch, go to the Apple Watch app on iPhone and look for the Wallet & Apple Pay section, then Add Credit or Debit Card section. iPads with Touch ID can use Apple Pay in apps; go to Settings then Wallet & Apple Pay to add your card there. Apple Pay works with the iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone SE, iPhone 7, and iPhone 7 Plus; all Apple Watches; iPad mini 4, iPad Air 2, and both iPad Pro models. Macs can also now use Apple Pay with macOS Sierra. You can view Apple’s full list of official partners here, while additional retailers also support Apple Pay. Though, at this point, there are still some notable holdouts that would rather launch their own separate mobile payment platforms.

Image: Emojipedia By Damon Beres2017-03-03 22:14:55 UTC Hey! Did you know that 68 percent of the people who work at Apple are dudes? That tech darlings like Uber have rampant sexism problems? And that only 4 percent of CEOs in the Fortune 500 are women?  And who would have thought it: That male-dominated culture seems to have dripped into something as innocent as your iPhone's emoji suggestions. SEE ALSO: Two determined women take on tech industry sexism in a new Secret ad If you type in leadership roles like "ceo," "cfo" or "cto" using the default keyboard in iOS, the emoji it suggests will be the default male in a suit, Mashable noticed Friday—even if you include a gendered context word like "she's" in the sentence you're composing. Men, men, men! Just like you'd see in Silicon Valley. Some caveats: We're not entirely sure how Apple's predictive text suggestions work, particularly when it comes to emoji, which were added as options only last year. The company did not immediately respond to our request for comment. Predictive text supposedly learns from your own texting habits, though it's possible that it also pulls in some aggregate data from other users to make better suggestions. There may also be a technical reason this is happening. Emoji are created using a standard called Unicode. A man's face is generated using the code U+1F468, while a female is generated with U+1F469. Because the code for a female character is a number higher than the code for a male, it's possible that the dude comes up by default. (See that? She's already a step behind.) Whatever the case, a number of Mashable staffers tried typing in the terms and confirmed that the emoji worked the same way by default for acronyms like "CFO" on their iPhones. You may see something different depending on your autofill or predictive text settings. In all fairness to Apple, iOS has generally been ahead of the competition when it comes to diverse emoji. It proposed female emoji variations for a few new professions last year, and if you type in one of them—firefighter, say—you'll get an emoji prediction for each gender: Note also that the female businesswoman emoji sometimes is suggested alongside her male counterpart: Capitalize "CEO" rather than using all lowercase and she will appear (not that anyone texts with Caps Lock on).  The female businesswoman also appears when you use iOS 10's "emoji replacement" option, which highlights key words that can be replaced by the iconic little characters. Better yet, she's even displayed ahead of that doofy guy with the mustache: So, no, this isn't a crisis per se for gender equality, but it does speak to how teeny biases can be communicated in everyday scenarios. Egregious? No. But worth considering in some layer of the massive dirt pie that is Big Tech's sexism problems? Absolutely. Thanks for the tip, Shelby Simon! Freia Lobo contributed reporting.

Yet despite these successes, it seems the phone may be experiencing some trouble on the sales front, and may have missed an opportunity to capitalize on competitors’ missteps. While Google doesn’t break out its numbers for Pixel units sold, analysts estimate that customers bought around 552,000 Pixel phones by the end of 2016, according to USA Today. In comparison, Apple sold 78 million iPhones between late September and December. Samsung sold 2.5 million Galaxy Note 7 phones between its mid-August launch and its October discontinuation. To put that in perspective, Google’s market share for smartphones shipped is now less than one percent worldwide — as compared to Samsung’s 18 percent — said Ramon Llamas, a research manager for the analysis firm International Data Corporation. So if Google is making its mark, it’s still a small one relative to the Samsung empire, which also runs on Google’s Android operating system. (Apple, by the way, is at 18.2 percent, according to IDC.) Google did not respond to a request for comment. So what gives? On paper, it seemed like it should have been a slam dunk for Google given the Pixel’s Google branding, Samsung’s Note 7 problems, and criticism of Apple’s latest iPhones not being that revolutionary. The Pixel is also an undeniably good phone, particularly in the absence of strong competition, thanks to its quality construction, pure version of Android and special Google features such as the voice-controlled Assistant. And Google has great brand recognition; it came in 8th in a reputation ranking looking at the world’s most visible companies. Samsung, on the same list, was 49th in the wake of its Note 7 and other issues. Plus, it’s not as though Google isn’t trying to sell this phone. The firm has sunk considerable effort and a reported $3.2 million in marketing costs, according to Reuters, into making the Pixel stand out as the “Google phone.” A profile of Google’s ad campaign from Fast Company revealed that Google chose to feature its iconic search bar in Pixel advertising to closely tie the smartphone in with its most iconic product. The big problem for Pixel is that only one carrier, Verizon, sells the phone, said Jeff Moore of research firm Wave7 Research. While users can get it directly from Google for full price of $649 — and take it to another carrier if they want — that’s not an option that a majority of wireless customers think about. “That’s a big minus,” Moore said. Companies sometimes offer phones with just one carrier, particularly when launching a new line; Apple’s iPhone was an AT&T exclusive at first, and Google has tapped Verizon as a carrier partner for its co-branded Nexus phones in the past. According to Wave7’s research, the Pixel got off to a good start with many in the survey saying demand was as high for Google’s phone as for other well-known manufacturers. But some of that excitement is starting to cool. Verizon representatives surveyed by Wave7 estimated that the Pixel accounted for 6.2 percent of activations in February, a decline from the previous three months. Compounding the availability issue, Moore said, is that stores are having trouble keeping the phones in stock. That’s a good sign for Google in terms of demand, but also a bad sign for the company in terms of being able to capitalize on that demand, he said. Google has had some trouble getting enough parts to make its phones, according to reports from The Verge as well as other industry analysts, due to the unexpected demand. That’s not to say the Pixel couldn’t pick up more steam over time. After all, the smartphone world seems a little boring right now, judging by the headlines coming out of last week’s Mobile World Congress. The most-discussed phone launched at the usually jam-packed show was a revived Nokia phone that last saw its heyday in 2000. But Samsung is set to announce its new phone on March 29; if it’s a hit, analysts said, Google’s set to face fiercer competition. Google professes to be happy with the Pixel’s sales. When talking to investors about Google’s last earnings report, chief executive Sundar Pichai said that he was “thrilled” with the reception that the company’s hardware had received this past holiday season. Moore, the Wave7 analyst, said he’s still bullish on Pixel. “They’ve gained a foothold at Verizon, and I’m sensing that demand is there.” Google, he said, has the deep pockets and the branding to push it forward. But as it stands right now, Google’s Pixel is more of an interesting experiment than a full-blown success, said IDC’s Ramos. “It’s great as a Verizon customer,” he said. “But we’re five months into this, and still at a point where supply cannot meet demand.” Please take a second to review our community guidelinesCommunity guidelines Blogs Staff Blogs Home All Politics is Local Blazer Banter Brews in Clark Cannabis Chronicles Clark County Faces Digital Desk Family Room Ghost Stories High School Sports HealthBeat History Political Beat Tailgate Talk Community It's the Fair!

Email | 06 Mar 2017 | Print  ExtraBITS for 6 March 2017 by TidBITS Staff In ExtraBITS this week, Apple is losing ground to Google in the classroom, YouTube TV plans to challenge pay TV providers, and Apple has a solution to its expiring provisioning profile problem. Apple’s Grip on the Classroom Slipping -- Apple has long had a strong position in the education market, but the New York Times reports that the company is losing ground to Google, with Apple’s iPads and Mac laptops now ranking third behind inexpensive laptops running Google’s Chrome OS or Microsoft’s Windows. Unfortunately, for those familiar with the education world, Google’s rise isn’t all that surprising, given the advantages Chromebooks have over iPads: they’re cheap, they have keyboards, there’s not much on them that students can mess up, and they’re backed up by services such as Google Classroom. Read/post comments YouTube TV to Offer Another Alternative for Cord Cutters -- Google will soon be competing with the likes of Sling TV, PlayStation Vue, and DirecTV Now. Set to debut within a few months in a new standalone app, the $35-per-month YouTube TV service will feature about three dozen channels, including ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox, as well as cable stalwarts like ESPN and Fox News. Google says the service will be designed primarily for mobile but will also work with computers and its Chromecast streaming devices. It’s slated to have a cloud-based DVR with unlimited storage and a Google AI-powered recommendation system. We’re guessing YouTube TV will be limited to U.S. viewers, but no details on international possibilities were mentioned. Read/post comments Apple Kicks Provisioning Profile Expirations Down the Road -- Provisioning profiles have been expiring recently, causing popular apps like 1Password and PDFpen to stop working suddenly. Apple has “solved” this problem by making it so that Developer ID provisioning profiles generated after 22 February 2017 will be valid for a whopping 18 years, regardless of the expiration date of the associated certificate! That puts the problem off for so long that only institutions and individuals trying to keep historical systems functional will be likely to suffer. After all, some of us still have decades-old Macs that can run software of the 1990s without difficulty. Read/post comments   Make friends and influence people by sponsoring TidBITS!

If you’d like to write a post for the Community to read (we’ll promote the best ones on our social feeds!), then head over to 9to5Google Community and submit your work! According to an internal Google document seen by 9to5Google, the Mountain View company’s next-generation Pixel flagship will forgo the headphone jack. That would be a departure from the current Pixel, for which Google has touted the jack’s inclusion as a key feature over Apple’s latest iPhone 7 offerings… Book a Free Smart Home Consultation w/ Amazon Services While we can’t share the nature of the documentation without putting the source at risk, we can say that the language used presents the removal of the jack as a matter of fact. That said, this information is coming from only a single source and we haven’t been able to obtain secondary confirmation as of yet. A separate tipster told us in January that Google has been testing multiple Pixel 2 models with a variety of new chipsets: “some with Snapdragon 83X chips, others with Intel chips.” That tipster didn’t mention the headphone jack, though, and it’s possible that Google hasn’t made a final decision yet on the new phone’s feature set. The same tipster said that waterproofing is “still on the table” for the next-gen Pixel, as well as mentioned the camera as once again being a primary focus point for Google with the new phone. They said that the phone’s camera will “not have large MP size,” but will rather “compensate in extra features.” Removing the jack would be a bold move from the company, since many Android OEMs — even Samsung, which will include the jack on the Galaxy S8 — have held onto the jack despite Apple’s removal of it with the launch of the iPhone 7. As mentioned, its removal would be particularly notable since Google also touted the headphone jack as being “satisfyingly not new” in the first ad for the original Pixel. Rumors on 9to5Google Community To make clear the lower confidence we have in this information, we’ve decided to share it here in the 9to5Google Community section. This is the medium by which we will be sharing unconfirmed rumors going forward. If our confidence increases, they will be promoted to a full report on 9to5Google. We stand by the information in this post as being accurate and honest, but can’t guarantee it will remain reliable. We will also be providing a 1-10 confidence score for these rumors based on a variety of factors (including timing, source, and the context of the information provided). Confidence score: 6/10 We haven’t yet been able to confirm this rumor with multiple sources, and that alone gives this rumor a significant downgrade. We also obtained this information second hand, which gives us further reason to question its legitimacy. Finally, there’s the obvious possibility that at this stage in development, Google still hasn’t decided on the final product’s feature set and things could change. That said, we give this rumor a score of 6 out of 10 because we were provided source documentation that appears legitimate. In other words, while we can’t assure you beyond a shadow of a doubt that the second-gen Pixel will indeed ship without the jack when it launches later this year, we can say with high confidence that this single internal document implies as such. (Tipsters, if you’re reading this and can help improve (or disprove) our confidence score, feel free to send us an anonymous encrypted email – we’d love to talk.)

The company continues to invest in high-quality, clean energy projects to help it meet and maintain its goal, and Jackson announced today that Apple has completed construction on its latest renewable energy project — a 50-megawatt solar farm in Arizona. Apple worked with local utility Salt River Project on the solar array, which will provide renewable power to Apple’s global command data center in Mesa, Arizona. That’s equal to the energy use of over 12,000 Arizona homes.

The lease, which has already been approval by the Rowan-Salisbury Board of Education, appeared before commissioners Monday for a final approval. The three-year lease would provide laptops and iPads to the school system for the next three years. With a hefty price tag, commissioners grilled Wagner and school system officials about the lease. First came a series of tough questions from Commissioner Mike Caskey, who said his children attend schools in the Rowan-Salisbury system. Caskey said he is “100 percent” behind the school system’s one-to-one initiative, but he wanted more information about the lease. Then, Pierce fired off a number of questions and wondered aloud whether the school system had asked all the necessary questions. “I have a little bit of trouble thinking that this is the only way we need to proceed,” Pierce said. “I haven’t seen any documentation showing that we have looked at any other way to proceed with educating our children. … Being that we’re not at the top of the list, I’ve got to think maybe we need to look at successful school systems and see what they’re doing.” Pierce used Lexington City Schools and Carteret County Schools as examples. “I would ask you: have we done our true due diligence and looked at all the different ways we can educate our children with a combination of textbooks as well as electronic devices to see what is the best fit,” Pierce said. “I don’t see that here. All I see is another, ‘Write me a check.'” Pierce said he was asking “hard questions” that the school board should have asked before coming to the Board of Commissioners. Responding, Wagner started by clarifying that the school system is not looking for any money. Wagner said that, as an elected official, his job is to ask tough questions, but it’s also important to trust people such as Superintendent Lynn Moody or County Manager Aaron Church. “What the board has done is have significant conversations,” Wagner said. “We have asked, probably, questions the administration has been a little aggravated with.” Wagner said laptops and iPads won’t be the “silver bullet” to solve all of the school system’s problems. He said Moody was hired to implement a vision that would improve the quality of education. “We have to give her some latitude,” Wagner said. Moody followed Wagner’s comments by clarifying an earlier point made by Pierce. She said Lexington and Carteret County’s public schools serve a different demographic than Rowan-Salisbury. “We have to approach our work differently,” she said. She said the school system may not be the best in the state, but it has improved significantly in recent years. At one point, Pierce said he was sure the $14 million lease would pass because other commissioners would “rubber stamp” it. That comment prompted Commissioners Chairman Greg Edds to ask others on the county’s governing board to verbally state that they would not make a “mindless, rubber-stamp decision” “Quite frankly, that’s pretty insulting,” Edds said, addressing Pierce’s remark. “Josh, how many times have you and I met on this? Hours and hours? … What goes on outside of this meeting, not everyone always knows, but that’s pretty insulting to sit here and listen to someone say we’re going to make a mindless, rubber-stamp decision.” Referring to Pierce’s Carteret County remark, Edds said is inappropriate to compare the Rowan-Salisbury school system to that of a beach community. County Commissioner Judy Klusman said people shouldn’t insult the school system unless he or she has visited a classroom. Teachers and school administrators are doing the best they can, Klusman said. She said the county commissioners should “get on with it” and pass the lease. Caskey, who was previously a school board member, wasn’t quite ready to proceed with the Apple lease. He said it is imperative that the county continue its one-to-one program but he wanted more time to look over documents. Caskey said he wasn’t aware that the school board would be presenting the lease until Monday’s meeting agenda was published last week. He suggested delaying consideration until commissioners have had more time to review relevant documents. Commissioners unanimously voted in favor of Caskey’s suggestion.

However it seems that this isn’t a trend that we’re seeing being picked up by many OEMs as there are still plenty of handsets out there with their headphone jacks intact. However it seems that in 2017, Google could be hopping onboard because according to a report from 9to5Google, it seems that Google could be thinking of ditching the headphone jack with the 2017 Pixel handset. This is apparently based on documentation shared with them by a source, and while they can’t share the documentation without revealing their source, it seems that the language used seemed to suggest that this could be the case. What this means is that if it is true, Google will use the USB-C port on the phone to connect headphones with, or recommend that users purchase Bluetooth headphones. At the moment there aren’t too many USB-C/Lightning connector headphones available, so Bluetooth is still probably the best bet if you want to charge your phone and listen to music at the same time. That being said, we have been hearing rumors about this year’s Pixel phone and how it is expected to be a “premium device”. The specs are unclear so we guess for now, ditching the headphone jack will be one of the phone’s rumored “features”. Filed in Cellphones >Rumors. Read more about Google and Pixel.

Apple Inc. is making sure that iPhone8 would again plot their path to rule the smartphone and technology industries around the globe. However, the Apple Inc’s iPhone 8 price is estimated to be around $1000 making it most expensive iPhone Apple has ever launched. Whatever it may be here are some of the best facts of iPhone 8 listed below – As Apple has been doing in past, it is expected that the upcoming iPhone model and its variants would have a brand new processor. The new chip is claimed to be A11 which is built upon 10 nanometres process and it is expected that it would not only boost the performance of the device by making it faster and powerful but also the processor size would be much smaller than the ones which are in recent models of iPhone. The Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company have been given the responsibility to securely manufacture this chip which would be delivered to the Apple Inc. by the end of April 2017. Apple iPhone8 is expected to have an OLED display. OLED stands for Organic Light  Emitting Diode, which is an ultra-thin technology of about 1mm in thickness. The screen would not require any backlight technology which was used in previous iPhone versions. This would not only make the iPhone more flexible but also provide a better viewing angle and more vividness to the screen. The screen is expected to have a 4K resolution display with full coverage over the body without any rim on the case. The device is expected to have a 5.8-inch screen of which only 5.15 inch would be usable. iPhone 8 Wireless Charging Apple Inc has done this with the latest iPad, as previous versions of iPad were named as iPad 2, iPad 3,iPad Air, iPad Air 2 etc. , but the latest released model was just named the Apple’s iPad. It is being perceived that the new upcoming model of iPhone8 would be named just the iPhone or iPhone X. However, this decision would be a real stunt in the technology market. Apple Inc is hoping it would bring some better sales for them. Apple Inc. after so many years of reluctance has finally decided to adopt the technology of wireless charging what Samsung has been using for years. It can be a  remarkable and worthy step for the Apple’s upcoming devices. All the features which Apple’s iPhone 7 lacked or went short of will be added on the most expected release from Apple Inc. on the tenth anniversary of iPhones. According to a famous technology analyst of KGI securities, Mr. Ming Chi Koi, Apple is focusing right on the basics of this wireless charging technology and trying to present a model without any flaw that would just get charged as soon as it is placed on a pad, making it the simpler for the users. Apple Inc’s iPhone 8 is expected to be launched with the latest iOS 11. The iOS 11 will have the advanced Siri, enhanced VR experience, more secure Apple Pay, switch settings easily and even reply directly from the notifications.

Here’s how to connect your iPad to ethernet in order to get the best internet connection. When you are on iOS 10.2 or above, there are new settings to help connect the iPad to ethernet. The iPad doesn’t include an ethernet port, so you will need to buy some adapters and accessories. This isn’t cheap, but if you need to connect an iPad in a bad WiFi area or at a trade show this is a purchase that is worth looking into. With the right accessories, you can connect your iPad directly to a modem or router with an Ethernet cable and in iOS 10.2 and higher, you can make changes to the Ethernet settings right on the iPad or iPhone. We’ve updated an older version of this guide that required a powered USB hub. If you are using an iPhone with a Lightning adapter you should be able to use a normal USB Ethernet adapter without any powered hub to give it extra juice. Everything you need to connect the iPad to ethernet.   What You Need to Connect Your iPad to Ethernet This is a little bit of a hack, but it is officially supported by Apple so you don’t void your warranty and there is no need to worry about breaking something. Here’s what you need to buy to use your iPhone or iPad with an ethernet cable. Lightning to USB Camera Adapter – Buy USB Ethernet Adapter – Buy Ethernet Cable – Buy An iPad – Buy You need to buy the official Lightning to USB camera adapter, but you can buy a cheaper USB to Ethernet adapter if you don’t want to pay Apple’s price. How to connect the iPhone or iPad to Ethernet.   How to Set Up an iPad Ethernet Connection This is the short list of steps you need to follow to use the iPad ethernet connection. You can use the same directions for the iPhone. Here’s a step-by-step guide on connecting your iPad to ethernet: First off, disable WiFi on your iPad, as well as cellular data if it’s an LTE model. Plug one end of the ethernet cable into a free port on your router, and the other end into the ethernet port on the USB Ethernet Adapter. Connect the USB end of the adapter to the Lightning to Camera connection. Plug the Lightning end of the adapter into your iPad. You can see a similar setup in the video below, but you no longer need to use a powered USB hub to make this work. After a few seconds, the iPad or iPhone will recognize the ethernet connection. If you are on iOS 10.2 or higher, you can now go to Settings and you will see an option to change Ethernet settings on your iPhone or iPad. iOS 10.2+ finally has a UI for USB ethernet adapter settings 🎉 pic.twitter.com/r7mojxgdGE — Steve T-S (@stroughtonsmith) February 28, 2017 This is a recent addition to iOS that will allow you more control over using ethernet as your main way of connecting an iPad. Once you have everything connected, open Safari and see if the connection is working before you move on to other options.   This is a great way to use the iPad at a trade show or another area where WiFi connections are often spotty. A simple investment in these adapters can save you from trying to fix a broken demo on the show floor. 13 Best 9.7-inch iPad Pro Cases Stylefolio Pencil 9.7-inch iPad Pro Case   1 / 13 The official 9.7-inch iPad Pro cases don't include any way to carry the Apple Pencil and the smaller iPad Pro together without worrying about losing the pencil. There is a small carrying area to store the pencil while you go somewhere with the iPad Pro, and there is also an inkwell spot to place the Apple pencil while you are switching between using it and using a keyboard. In addition to carrying the Apple Pencil, this case protects the front and back of the iPad Pro while allowing you to use the iPad in a variety of positions. The pencil holder makes this slightly wider than other cases. $59.95 at Speck   1 / 13 92 Responses 08/28/2014 dksmidtx Reply Or you could just use any Windows tablet (Surface pro 3 my choice) and connect the USB Ethernet adapter directly to the built-in USB port… 12/26/2015 jai Reply BUT WINDOWS IS SHIT 02/25/2016 bbeny Reply Sounds to me like apple is shit, considering you need 50 devices just to connect an ipad to a wired network. 03/08/2016 Blerglr Reply Stop being a dick. 03/08/2016 rnc Reply Except you need to download 50 drivers, and 10 have a virus on it. 03/09/2016 Aymel Reply Stop talking shit. 03/09/2016 Nico Reply You must be a complete idiot if that is the case. 10/22/2014 homeactivist Reply Thank you, Craig Lloyd, I have been looking for a way to do this. However, my iPad 2 does not have a port for a lightning connector. It has a port for 30 pin. Is there still a way for me to connect my iPad 2 to ethernet? 10/27/2014 Quaboag Reply I use the Apple 30-pin camera adapter on my iPad 2 just fine. It also works on my old iPhone 4. And, with the lightening to 30-pin adapter it even works on my iPhone 6 so you should be good to go. Just make sure you turn off the cell connection just in case it doesn’t connect properly (a reboot will usually fix it), otherwise you may end up burning up your monthly MB’s thinking that you’re on the wire. 11/09/2014 John Smith Reply I have an iPad Air and this didn’t work on it. Any suggestions? 11/09/2014 Quaboag Reply It worked on my mother’s iPad Air when she was over for a visit. She was running iOS 8, although I don’t know if that makes a difference since it works fine on my iPhone 4 running iOS 7.1. (Side note to Homeactivist: I’m pretty sure you have to have at least iOS 7.) It can take 30 seconds or so to connect, so it won’t necessarily work right away. I would suggest trying to reboot the iPad and then try again. Every once in awhile I have problems and this clears it right up. 02/02/2015 Konrad Reply Hello Craig Lloyd, I tried your description with the IPHONE 4 (version 8.1.3) and the IPAD MINI (version 8.1.2) from my girlfriend. Both doesn’t work. The USB to Ethernet adapter I used is from “networx”. Is the original adapter from apple needed or not? If yes, what’s the differences? 05/04/2015 Mike Ridenhour Reply As of May 4, 2015 you can buy a Redpark Ethernet Cable for iPhone or iPad 08/19/2015 Gavin Williams Reply You are required to have an app that uses their SDK to make use of it. It won’t work system wide 09/02/2015 Yvonne Reply Does their app allow one to surf net and make purchases…anyone know? I tried getting in touch with app maker but would go thru. 06/05/2015 Papi Black Reply this looks great. will it keep charging the ipad? 06/08/2015 Bartek Reply Thanks for the guide! Works really well. Just got a very quick question – is there any way to charge the iPad with this set up? I need to be able to set an iPad up so that it always is connected to a power supply and wired network. Thanks! 03/30/2016 Celso Reply OK, I can confirm that Apple’s new lightning-to-USB 3 adapter, which can (and must) be powered simultaneously, DOES work wirh a wired ethernet connection for my iPad Pro. I’m sending this post with such a setup. So, no need for a powered USB hub anymore. Great! Now, it is working with a DYNAMIC IP, tupe 192.168…., or 10.0…. . It does NOT work with a fixed, corporate IP. If someone knows how it could work, please let us know! 10/29/2016 Helping Reply if you mean what I think and therefore you can get a DHCP server to give the IPAD an IP but you can’t set an IP address that your corporate IT department gave you then you just need to find the MAC address of the USB–Ethernet adaptor (likely printed on if not plug it into a PC and do ipconfig /all to find its ‘hardware address’ – sure you can do this on a mac too just cant remember) then give your corporate IT team the MAC address and tell them to setup a static reservation on their DHCP server so that it will give out the same static IP address they wanted you to use for the IPAD. therefore you plug the iPad in, it asks the DHCP server for the address, the DHCP server see’s the USB Ethernet mac address and assigns it the static IP address they wanted you to use. If the corporate network has no DHCP server then the only other way is (and be super careful about this and involve corporate IT) you need to set a DHCP server on the same wired network that the iPad is on that will *ONLY* respond to DHCP requests from the iPad and nothing else (or you could seriously screw up the network). Now when i say setup a DHCP server i don’t mean some big load expensive server box, it could just be a simple bit of software you run on your corporate PC just for this task. Then setup the static reservation for the iPad on that DHCP server. N.B on a corporate network depending on their switches security settings you may need to plug iPad and the machine running this DHCP server into a cheap unmanaged switch and then plug that unmanaged switch into the main corporate network 10/29/2016 Celso Reply Hi “Helping”, Thank you very much for your reply. So, using the dongle’s MAC instead of a computer´s could be a way to go. Now, the issue is that the network (a university´s) also uses TTSL and other configurations. But I’ll try to try ;-) what you suggest. 07/06/2015 ccanestro Reply A quick question: why use a lightning to camera adapter instead of using the cable that come with charger wich is already lightning to USB and plug it in the hub? 07/10/2015 Daryl Goodman Reply Because it would only charge the device 07/15/2015 kcliew Reply Can it work the other way round? I had a machine that need wireless network connection but does not have wireless adapters. The only way to connect to the network is by using ethernet cable. Can this method work? My ipad will be use as a wireless adapter and connect to my machine using ethernet cable to provide network connectivity. 07/16/2015 WB Reply Hi – I was wondering if I could follow these steps to connect my iPhone 6 to the ethernet in my office.

I am using the following: ipad4, inland usb to lan adapter (says mac compatible), inland 13port usb powered hub, lightning to usb camera (apple) adapter, ethernet cable 08/03/2015 Steve Reply I’m getting the “unsupported” message too, on my old iPad 2. Trying to use a Belkin powered USB 2.0 hub, but as soon as I plug it in via my Camera Kit adapter, it says “Unsupported Device AX88772B The connected device is not supported. 08/05/2015 Steve Reply I’m guessing, since this happens before I even try to connect the Ethernet Adapter, that my iPad is not compatible with my powered USB hub. 08/01/2015 Martin Reply Woow it work on my iPad mini 2… Thanks a lot 08/05/2015 cesare Reply Its NOT working with our iPad Air 2 (A1566, end 2014) with iOS 8.4.. We are using all components like in the video but no lightning to USB adapter as there is a direct lightning to USB cable now from Apple. Any hints would be appreciated! 08/05/2015 Quaboag Reply Have you tried the Roy Trenneman method? (Have you tried turning it off and on again?) On rare occasions I need to do a reboot to make it work. Also, is the USB->Ethernet the Apple brand? Both my iPad 2 and iPhone 6 are running 8.4 and they work fine, but maybe there’s something particular about your hardware where there’s a stray duck that left the row. I’d also suggest trying a different powered USB hub if you have one available. 08/05/2015 Cesare Reply Yes its an Apple Ethernet-USB. didn’t try the reboot, will try that later. Is the lightning – USB cable ok or would i need an lightning – USB adapter? Sorry but i can’t find the Roy Trenneman method, i even searched for it…Do you have link? 08/05/2015 Quaboag Reply The lightning to USB cable (the camera adapter) has been reported to work fine. I have a mix of 30-pin and lightning ports on my devices, and I already had the 30-pin to lightning adapter, so it made more sense for me to use the 30-pin camera adapter. Roy Trenneman is a character on the British sitcom “The IT Crowd” who’s catchphrase is “Have you tried turning it on and off gain?” which is a hoot for those of us who work with or as sysadmins (especially with Windows servers!). Search for him on YouTube or for the show on Netflix or Amazon. :) 08/05/2015 Cesare Reply Thanks for your help anyway. The “Roy Trennemann” method doesn’t work either unfortunately… One think i would like to make clear in order to avoid confusion. I have NEVER used the “camera adapter” but use a cable that directly connects lightning to USB (delivered by Apple with the IPad.. Do you think this is the problem? 08/05/2015 Quaboag Reply Yes, that’s most certainly your problem. The standard USB cable provides power and a connection for syncing, but isn’t really providing a USB port, whereas the camera adapter is adding a standard USB port to your device. It’s only intended to be used for downloading pictures from a camera, and is totally unsupported by Apple for any other purpose, but it does work with some other USB devices. (e.g. My USB keyboard works fine with it.) You should be able to plug the ethernet-USB adapter directly into the camera adapter, except that the iPad cannot provide enough power for it. That’s why we stick the powered USB hub in the middle. So it really works just as if you were using it on a laptop. Plug the ethernet-USB adapter into the hub, plug the male end of the hub into the camera adapter, and plug the camera adapter into the iPad. A downside is that you cannot power the iPad at the same time. 08/05/2015 Cesare hi. thanks. i’m pretty sure that this will do the trick… 08/19/2015 Cesare This did the trick. Works like a charm now. Thanks for your support. 08/07/2015 Yvonne Reply Using setup as described with occasional issue although until lately just rebooted. Lately tho, I’m having to turn off power to router several times before I get a connection again. Any ideas??? Also, would IOS 8 or 9 help??? Anyone try the Redpark cable, if so what Apple app is needed for surfing net? Thanks if anyone has help! 08/16/2015 Trader. Reply Nope, nothing, doesn’t work on my iPad Air iOS 8.4.1. I’ve tried different cables and power hubs but still nothing. I’ve tried rebooting etc. but still nothing. 08/16/2015 Trader Reply Nope, doesn’t work on my iPad 4 either. Vexed. 08/16/2015 Cody Reply This didn’t work for my iPad mini. Using 3.0 hub. I’m sure that’s the issue though. Does usb to Ethernet need to be Apple brand? Did anyone have to configure the router to open certain ports? Thanks 08/16/2015 Cody Reply Meant to say 3.0 hub is not the issue 08/20/2015 Gutflieger Reply It worked fine with IOS 8.4. but since I updated to IOS 8.4.1 it does not work. Any ideas how to work around in IOS 8.4.1.? 08/25/2015 Trader Reply Not sure this post is gonna work… Anyway, I’ve now got it working on iOS 8.4.1. 08/26/2015 eccsd Reply Great Thanks! I have it working on both iPhone 5s and iPad mini (iOS 8.4.1) in airplane mode (or wifi off if wifi-only iPad), even though the error message still pops up about the USB to Ethernet adapter being incompatible. (I have Apple’s own USB to Ethernet adapter.) I just ignore the error message and voilà! 08/30/2015 Mumsey Reply I use an airport express as a router and it doesn’t have an ethernet “out” port, so I tried the setup by plugging directly into the cable modem instead of a router and could not get it to work.

Perhaps a noteworthy point: when I turn the wireless network on my router off the iPad connects via the wired connection without turning the iPad wi-fi setting off or setting iPad to airplane mode (iOS 9.1). 10/22/2015 Britt Reply Hellow ya all, iPad Model search https://support.apple.com/nl-nl/HT201471 Searching the list I’ve noticed that I have a iPad 3th generation – A1430 Wi-Fi + cellular 64GB, Year: early 2012 Software: 8.3 I’ve tried it over and over again but it won’t work. What am I doing wrong or maybe it won’t work at all with the ‘older’ type of iPad’s. “I still don’t understand WHY Apple doesn’t come up with a solution to have the Ipad wired directly to LAN!” That’s indeed very strange because not everybody is a fan of Wi-Fi. My ‘installation’ so far: I have a Apple USB Ethernet Adapter, TP-Link USB 3.0 7-port Hub Power 12V DC, have fast internet at home, have a Cat6 Ethernet cable. iPad has a 30 pin connecter for energy.

Apple helpline was nice but clueless, local megastore ditto. 01/06/2016 vincentsong Reply Can I just disable Wifi, but keep bluetooth on? Is iOS9.2 working? 01/12/2016 Celso Reply OK, the setup works great with: iPad Air 1 and iPad Pro; iOS 9; original (Apple) USB-to-ethernet adapter, and Apple 30-pin (plus lightgning-30-pin) to USB reader. To those people that can’t make it work, I suggest, make sure your router distributes dynamic IPs, of course. In fact, I’ve found out that with the direct connection the iPad doesn’t get an IP (?), or at least I can’t find it. Another finding: turning on Wi-Fi or shared internet over Bluetooth overrides the direct ethernet setup. i’ve being trying to get AirPlay AND this setup over an ad hoc wifi network. For example, you go to a place with bad wifi but good ethernet. You get ethernet internet in the iPad, and mirror it with an ad hoc, even slow wifi network. Doesn’t work. BUT, AirPlay to an AppleTV or to a computer with a mirroring program (Reflector 2) DOES work if the mirroring device is in the same wired or wireless network. Now, how to power the iPad? A USB adapter gizmo with powering lighting connection would be needed. Another thing: does anyone know what this direct setup may do to an iPad’s wifi? 01/21/2016 Joe Reply Was working fine up until 9.2 software upgrade. Now I get a “USB Hub 2.0: device requires too much power” message, even though I have it connected to a poweed usb hub. My other ipad which is still at 9.1, works using same setup. Any suggestions? 01/26/2016 KARL Reply Does anyone know if i can change the IP address of the ipad when connected via ethernet? 01/26/2016 Karl Reply Does anyone know if i can change the ip address of the ipad when it is connected via ethernet? 03/04/2016 Cao Reply In my house it work wonderfully. However I want to use it in my office, but I need to be able to set up the proxy configuration. The IPad Pro in Settings/General/About only recognize the apple usb camera adapter and not the Ethernet adapter. And in the Apple Usb Camera Adapter there is no option to set up the proxy configuration. Does anyone knows where and how can I add proxy configurations to these connections? Thanks a lot. Best regards. 03/04/2016 Celso Reply @Cao My guess is that you need an intermediate device to configure the proxy, for example, one for powerline ethernet. I’ve had several Devolo powerline adapters over years and they have worked flawlessly. I suppose you can configure the proxy in one Devolo device, which sends its own IP to the other one(s): http://www.devolo.co.uk/dlan-powerline-adapter/ 03/04/2016 Craig Reply Can any of you answer the question please: Does this method power the iPad and allow it to remain charged. Best I can tell from the comments the answer is NO but no one ever seems to directly answer the question. 03/04/2016 Ken Foulks Reply @Cao, I’m pretty sure you can’t add proxy settings or do anything except a basic connection. @Craig, No, you cannot power the ipad and have a connection through the same port, at least not without something more custom than this setup. 03/27/2016 Bob-O Reply The new camera adapter with a plug for lightning power cord* keeps battery charged as well as powers the Ethernet-USB adapter directly, no hub required at all.

With the newer iPads and iOS, all you need is: – a USB-to-lightning adapter, which includes a charging slot – an ethernet-to-USB adapter; must be the Apple adapter, apparently – a lightning power cord and brick Just turn off wifi and plug in the three devices. The brick simultaneously charges the iPad and powers the ethernet adapter 03/06/2017 Ryan Reply FOR ANYONE TRYING TO CONNECT IPAD TO ETHERNET! It wasnt working for me, I bought multiple adapters and finally found out my problem.

SiliconValley.com Twitter Facebook Google+ RSS   Social Web Mobile Cloud Gadgets Cleantech VC Data Games Policy Media   Elon Musk, Tim Cook top Page, Pichai, Zuckerberg and Gates as ‘visionaries’ in survey of tech leaders By Ethan Baron / March 6, 2017 at 4:24 PM Launching space rockets and building revolutionary automobiles puts you on a higher pedestal than peddling cat videos, memes and news stories real and fake, it appears. Tesla CEO and SpaceX founder Elon Musk came out on top in the “tech visionaries” category of a KPMG survey of more than 800 tech-industry leaders around the world. Apple CEO Tim Cook came in second, with Google co-founder Larry Page and Google CEO Sundar Pichai tied for third with Jack Ma, founder of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, KPMG reported March 6. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella came in fourth. Tied for fifth were Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates. It should be noted that when it comes to who thinks who is visionary, Google’s Pichai is big in India — at No. 1, in fact. Asian respondents in general gave higher marks to Pichai, Nadella and Samsung CEO Kwon Oh-hyun, according to KPMG. It was the fifth year that KPMG has conducted the survey. Musk won last year, too, but not by as much — this year he vanquished all others by more than double the percentage as last year, KPMG said. But in America, with input from other countries excluded, Apple’s Cook beat Musk for the title of most visionary leader, according to KPMG. And while Google failed to crack the top two on the visionaries list, as a company it dominated its tech rivals. Asked which company is the leader in driving tech innovation, a fifth of respondents answered “Google,” putting the firm at the top of the list. Apple came in second, but slipped a bit this year, to 15 percent of respondents naming the firm as the dominant leader on innovation, from 18 percent last year. Next up were Microsoft and IBM and spots three and four, respectively. Amazon and Tesla tied for fifth. How could ol’ Big Blue beat explosive, transformative Amazon? IBM’s record 8,000 patents received last year had something to do with it, according to KPMG. Many tech leaders see patents as “a metric of innovation,” and the firm’s patent frenzy shows “a commitment to artificial intelligence and predictive analytics,” KPMG said.   Photo:  Tesla CEO Elon Musk in 2015 at the company’s headquarters, in Fremont (Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP) Share this: Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Reddit Google More Pinterest Tumblr   Tags: Alibaba, Apple, bill gates, elon musk, facebook, Google, Innovation, Jack Ma, KMPG, larry page, leader, leaders, mark zuckerberg, Microsoft, Satya Nadella, SpaceX, Sundar Pichai, tesla, Tim Cook, visionaries, visionary   More Posts in Big Tech Google’s planned futuristic new Mountain View campus revealed as city council prepares final vote on it March 3, 2017   Dear Elon, I have an idea… March 2, 2017   Google spinoff Waymo vs Uber: Does Uber have a defense against claim of self-driving car secrets theft?

Skip to content GPS Tracking Info Just another NEWS site Uncategorized Mundo Entretenimento Negócios Desporto Uncategorized Mundo Entretenimento Negócios Desporto Google may have missed big chance to become major smartphone maker By admin in Uncategorized March 7, 2017 Since its October launch, Google’s Pixel phone has received rave reviews, and Google recently confirmed to the Android-focused publication Android Pit that it will release a new Pixel this year. Yet despite these successes, it seems the phone may be experiencing some trouble on the sales front, and may have missed an opportunity to capitalise on competitors’ missteps.While Google doesn’t break out its numbers for Pixel units sold, analysts estimate that customers bought around 552,000 Pixel phones by the end of 2016, according to USA Today. In comparison, Apple sold 78 million iPhones between late September and December. Samsung sold 2.5 million Galaxy Note 7 phones between its mid-August launch and its October discontinuation. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Google’s market share for smartphones shipped is now less than one per cent worldwide. Photo: AP To put that in perspective, Google’s market share for smartphones shipped is now less than one per cent worldwide – as compared to Samsung’s 18 per cent – said Ramon Llamas, a research manager for the analysis firm International Data Corporation. So if Google is making its mark, it’s still a small one relative to the Samsung empire, which also runs on Google’s Android operating system. Google did not respond to a request for comment.So what gives? On paper, it seemed like it should have been a slam dunk for Google given the Pixel’s Google branding, Samsung’s Note7 problems, and criticism of Apple’s latest iPhones not being that revolutionary. The Pixel is also an undeniably good phone, particularly in the absence of strong competition, thanks to its quality construction, pure version of Android and special Google features such as the voice-controlled Assistant. And Google has great brand recognition; it came in 8th in a reputation ranking looking at the world’s most visible companies. Samsung, on the same list, was 49th in the wake of its Note7 and other issues.Plus, it’s not as though Google isn’t trying to sell this phone. The firm has sunk considerable effort and a reported US$3.2 million in marketing costs, according to Reuters, into making the Pixel stand out as the “Google phone”. A profile of Google’s ad campaign from Fast Company revealed that Google chose to feature its iconic search bar in Pixel advertising to closely tie the smartphone in with its most iconic product. Advertisement The big problem for Pixel is that only one carrier, Verizon, sells the phone, said Jeff Moore of research firm Wave7 Research. While users can get it directly from Google for full price of US$649 – and take it to another carrier if they want – that’s not an option that a majority of wireless customers think about.”That’s a big minus,” Moore said.Companies sometimes offer phones with just one carrier, particularly when launching a new line; Apple’s iPhone was an AT&T exclusive at first, and Google has tapped Verizon as a carrier partner for its co-branded Nexus phones in the past.According to Wave7’s research, the Pixel got off to a good start with many in the survey saying demand was as high for Google’s phone as for other well-known manufacturers. But some of that excitement is starting to cool. Verizon representatives surveyed by Wave7 estimated that the Pixel accounted for 6.2 per cent of activations in February, a decline from the previous three months.Compounding… Post navigation Stephen Coniglio replaces Heath Shaw as GWS vice-captain IEM Sydney announced: world’s best Counter-Strike players to battle for $260,000 in Australia Search for: Recent Posts Spring scenery in Tibet Begum Jaan Vidya Balan pulls a Shah Rukh Khan on us and boy, we are impressed!

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on: Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink: Purchase: Order Reprint Business review from the Economist European stock exchange deal falls apart The proposed merger of the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse seemed headed for collapse. The final nail in the coffin was said to be the LSE's rejection of an ultimatum from European antitrust regulators for it to sell its stake in a bond-trading platform in Italy. The LSE reportedly rejected the demand without consulting its intended German partner. The British and German exchanges announced their intention to merge a year ago, before Britain voted to leave the E.U. Prosecutors in South Korea charged Lee Jae-yong, the de facto head of Samsung, and four other executives with bribery and corruption following a lengthy investigation. Lee is accused of directing $38 million in bribes to an associate of the country's president in order to smooth the merger of two Samsung affiliates. He denies wrongdoing. Fillon OneWeb, a start-up that plans to launch a constellation of small satellites that will provide internet connection to remote places, is to merge with Intelsat, one of the biggest operators of commercial satellites. The deal is backed by SoftBank, a technology group, which has invested in OneWeb. Warren Buffett revealed that Berkshire Hathaway, his investment company, had more than doubled the number of shares it owns in Apple, giving it a stake worth around $18 billion. Apple is now one of Berkshire's biggest equity holdings. India's economy grew by 7 percent in the last quarter of 2016 compared with the same period of 2015. That was a more robust figure than economists had expected, given the government's surprise decision in November to withdraw 86 percent of the bank notes in circulation in an effort to curb corruption and counterfeiting. A slump in oil prices and revenue caused Nigeria's economy to shrink in 2016 for the first time in 25 years. GDP contracted by 1.5 percent as oil production tumbled. A shortage of dollars, used by many businesses to pay for imports, also contributed to the slowdown. The IMF forecasts that the economy will grow by 0.8 percent this year and 2.3 percent in 2018. Noble Group reported a small profit of $8.7 million for last year. Noble was once Asia's biggest commodities-trading firm, until it was hit by a double whammy of plunging commodity prices and questions about its accounts. Travis Kalanick issued a mea culpa. The chief executive of Uber admitted that "I need leadership help" after video footage emerged of him launching a verbal tirade at an Uber driver who had criticized the ride-hailing app's business model. It is another dent in Uber's image; it also faces allegations of sexual harassment from a former employee. Snapchat priced its IPO at $17 a share, above the price range it set out in its prospectus. Demand was strong for the most eagerly awaited stock issuance by a tech firm in years. Elon Musk, the founder of SpaceX, said he intends to fly people around the moon by the end of next year. Two wealthy space tourists have apparently volunteered. But the Falcon Heavy rocket needed to launch the moon capsule has not yet come into operation. Global politics from the Economist Fillon to press on in France vote François Fillon, the Republican candidate in France's presidential election, declared that he will continue his campaign despite being subject to an official criminal investigation over payments he made to his wife and children. Fillon said he had been unfairly singled out by magistrates and implied that the investigation was politically motivated. Francois Hollande, France's president, criticized Fillon for questioning the impartiality of the justice system. Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, proposed that the European Union pull back from some activities that could be better handled locally by members, such as social policy. He also called for tighter E.U. integration on key policies such as migration, defense and trade. The Iraqi government's assault on the remaining presence of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant in west Mosul continued, with the government taking control of the city's airport and one of the bridges over the Tigris river. It also cut the last road out of west Mosul, preventing fresh supplies from reaching ISIL. China's most senior diplomat, Yang Jiechi, met President Donald Trump in the White House. They discussed a possible meeting between Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping. No date has been set, but both countries agreed that they should meet regularly. Bangladesh softened a law intended to reduce child marriage, allowing girls younger than 18 to marry in certain circumstances, as huge numbers already do.

Samsung Pay is now live in India Posted 30 minutes ago by Jon Russell (@jonrussell) 0 SHARES Next Story Safaricom and mSurvey launch Consumer Wallet to map Africa’s cash economy Samsung Pay has launched in India where it is working on selected devices, according to a report from Sam Mobile. The Korean firm had teased its entry to India’s payments market last month, but now it has rolled out with support for banks Axis, HDFC, ICICI, SBI, and Standard Chartered, and credit and debit cards from MasterCard and Visa. Beyond traditional financial organizations, Samsung has also teamed up with Paytm — India’s largest mobile wallet with 200 million registered users — to add support for its digital payment service. That’s a particularly important given how the government’s demonitization program last year has accelerated the rise of digital cash. The real limitation at this point is device support, with Sam Mobile reporting that the service is available on the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, Galaxy Note 5, Galaxy S6 Edge+, Galaxy A5 and Galaxy A7. Still, the launch is a step beyond Apple, which has not yet released its Apple Pay service in India. Speaking on a visit to the country last year, CEO Tim Cook said the iPhone maker intends to bring Apple Pay to India but for now it seems that other countries in Asia have taken priority. In an interview with TechCrunch one year ago, Apple Pay VP Jennifer Bailey said the U.S. firm was working to expand the payment service’s footprint in Asia and beyond. Since then, the service has rolled out in Hong Kong, France, Singapore and Japan among others. This India launch takes Samsung Pay to a total of 13 countries, including China, the U.S. and Korea. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Samsung Electronics Founded 1969 Overview Samsung Electronics is a South Korean multinational electronics company engaged in consumer electronics, information technology and mobile communications, and device solutions businesses worldwide.

Apple iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are going through a discount spree on Amazon India. The e-commerce website shows major price cuts for Apple’s latest iPhone 7 and 7 Plus as well as a new iPhone 6 with 32GB storage variant. The iPhone 7 32GB variant after discount comes at a price of Rs 49,999, all the way from Rs 60,000. The larger iPhone 7 128GB variant is priced at Rs 59,999, down from Rs 70,000. Top of the line iPhone 7 256GB variant comes at a price tag of Rs 70,215, down from Rs 80,000. Coming to the iPhone 7 Plus, the 32GB variant is priced at Rs 61,999, down from Rs 72,000/ The 128GB variant is priced at Rs 71,999, down from Rs 82,000. Sadly, there is no discount for the top of the line 256GB model of the iPhone 7 Plus. The iPhone 6 32GB storage variant went on sale for a price tag of Rs 28,999. This is surprising, as the iPhone 6 never came in a 32GB storage configuration. The device was sold by third-party seller E-Mobiles. The device is legit, as it was confirmed by Apple India, and a similar variant was also spotted to be on sale in China since February 2017. This variant is currently available on Amazon India as of now. These deals are from the third-party sellers on Amazon India, and not from the e-commerce giant itself. The deal is only valid till the stocks available. Moreover, you also have an EMI option available, to make it lighter on your wallet.

Ten of the best apps to manage your money By Eleanor Lawrie and Emma Gunn and Sarah Davidson For Thisismoney.co.uk Published: 03:09 EST, 7 March 2017 | Updated: 03:09 EST, 7 March 2017 e-mail View comments Do you find the idea of sorting out your finances boring, or even overwhelming? It doesn't have to be this way.  One great thing about the ubiquity of smartphones is they offer an amazing array of tools to make your life easier, and this include apps that can help make your money work harder.  Want your cash to last until payday, get into investing or start a savings habit?  There are apps to help you achieve all these goals and more. While there are a dizzying array of options out there, we've done the legwork for you and picked ten of the best money apps - let us know your favourites in the comments below. Very app-ealing? These mobile apps can help you manage your money while on the go Moneybox: Invest your spare change What does it do?  What if you could invest money that you wouldn't really miss? That's the premise behind Moneybox, which rounds up small everyday purchases to an amount set by you and puts the excess into a stocks and shares Isa to help you get on the investing ladder from as little as £1. Would you like an Isa with your coffee? Moneybox invests your leftover change How does it work?  Aimed mainly at Millennials (those aged 18-35), Moneybox is designed to ease you in to the investing habit. After downloading the app through Apple or Android, you link it to the debit card of your choice and choose how much you want it to round up by each month. You can also choose to make monthly top-ups to boost your investment pot.  Instead of getting lost down the back of the sofa, your small change will be invested in your choice of stocks and shares Isa - cautious, balanced or adventurous.

Share this article Share HOW THIS IS MONEY CAN HELP Best high interest-paying current accounts to make your money work harder Each option contains different allocations of the same three tracker funds - a Henderson cash fund, a Vanguard global equities fund and a Blackrock property equities fund.  Preliminary tests showed users made about 30 purchases a week with an average round up amount of 28p – adding up to £8.40 per week, or almost £437 per year.  While no one can predict what will happen in the future, stock markets do tend to go up over time. According to the app makers, £1,000 invested in the 'balanced' mid-range portfolio in 2007, followed by monthly £50 top ups, would have been worth £8,662 by the end of 2015. Tailor-made: The app lets you pick a portfolio based on your appetite for risk  How much does it cost?  Moneybox is free to use for the first three months, and costs £1 per month after that to cover transaction fees. The app also charges a platform fee of 0.45 per cent, and users must pay for the underlying tracker funds, which cost around 0.2 per cent.  Is my money protected? The company is authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority so if it was to go bust, your investments would be protected up to the value of £50,000.  This only applies if the company fails, not if your investments lose money - which could happen, as with any form of playing the stock market.  Moneyfarm - An affordable wealth management service  What does it do? The app for wealth manager Moneyfarm is a quick and convenient way to create and keep track of an investment portfolio on the go. The idea is that you can open an account and start investing within 10 minutes, in a way that is cheaper than using a traditional financial adviser or investing platform.  How does it work?  When you sign up you'll be given a questionnaire to assess your appetite for risk, which will help place you in to one of six investment portfolios. These portfolios are monitored by Moneyfarm's investment committee who rebalance them as the market moves so that they stay within your risk tolerance level while (hopefully) increasing in value.  Moneyfarm helps you grow your investments There is no minimum investment amount - customers can open an account with just £1. However, the wealth manager recommends that customers put in at least £1,500 so that their investments can be sufficiently diversified across different parts of the market to meet the level of risk they want to take.  Using Moneyfarm in app form means you can review your portfolio, track the performance and withdraw money whenever you want, using your phone. How much does it cost? There are no management fees on the first £10,000, but you will pay a 0.6 per cent charge on anything between £10,001 to £100,000. For investments of between £100,000 and £1million this charge falls to 0.4 per cent, and there is nothing to pay on investments of more than £1million. This means that if you invested £20,000, for example, the management fee would be £60. That's because there is no charge on the first £10,000, and a 0.6 per cent charge on the remaining £10,000. On top of this, Moneyfarm users must pay the underlying cost of the ETFs used to build their portfolio, typically 0.25 per cent, which is taken from the value of their investments. There are no other fees to pay. Is my money protected? Your personal account details are encrypted to help keep them safe, while MoneyFarm is authorised and regulated by the FCA. As with Moneybox, if the company collapsed, your investments would be protected up to the value of £50,000 under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. However, as with any investment, the value of your assets can go down as well as up and you may come out with less money than you started with.  Better budgeting: Money Dashboard categories your spending automatically  Money Dashboard – keeps track of all your accounts in one place and breaks down your spending What does it do?  Money Dashboard is a clever tool which lets you view all of your incomings and out-goings including credit cards, current accounts and savings all in one place, using just one log in. For those with accounts with several different providers this can be a real time saver particularly if you struggle to remember all of your online banking passwords.  How does it work? The app is available for both Android and iOS users for free. Users can get weekly snapshots via email and view their dashboard online. It will categorise most of your transactions automatically, for example tagging your electricity bills, credit card or mortgage payments and even your food shopping, and the rest can be manually added. The app then cleverly groups similar transactions together to highlight exactly how much you spend - useful in encouraging you to cut back on meals out or skipping your morning coffee. The information is then used to create colourful graphs and charts that help you better understand your habits and where each pound is going each month. If you want to start a savings habit you can then set up goals with the help of the handy budget planner which can predict how much cash you will likely have left over. How much does it cost?  The app is available for both Android and iOS users for free.  Is it safe? To sync all of your bank details you will need to enter your online banking details at the start, however the dashboard is read-only so no payments can be made using the tool. Plus the company uses bank-level security to protect its customers' details and accounts. Make sure to check your bank’s terms and conditions as some may see you giving your details to third party aggregator services such as Money Dashboard as being careless with your security details which can affect your rights. The MoneyDashboard website says: ‘Use of an aggregation service is not a reason for your bank to not compensate you. We acknowledge our responsibility to you to make good any losses you may suffer through our service.’ Squirrel: The app that aims to stop you spending all your cash the day you get paid Squirrel – releases your cash bit by bit What does it do?  The Squirrel app operates on the basis of out-of-sight, out-of-mind. It works as a buffer between you and your wage, drip-feeding your cash back into your account as and when it is needed and portioning out what you have left so you don’t spend it all at once.  How does it work? Users must direct their income into a Barclays-powered Squirrel account in their name. The Squirrel app segments your money into three groups – commitments (your bills, rent or mortgage payments), savings and spending money. The app then releases funds back to your current account bit by bit. When bills are due the Squirrel account will pay the needed balance back into your bank account just in time to make sure you always have enough cash to cover them plus it will allocate funds for any savings goals you are working towards into a separate savings pot. Any money left over is classed as spending money which the app then divides into weekly instalments which are then transferred into your current account at the start of each week to help stretch your cash out between pay days. If you need more cash for unexpected expenses you can ask for more of your pay cheque to be transferred to your account early, but it will take a day to hit. Payments can be made same day if you need the funds in an emergency. How much does it cost?  You can download the Squirrel app via iOS or Android stores and open an account. The first three months are free and then it costs £3.99-a-month. While an excel spreadsheet and some self-restraint could do the job for free, the Squirrel app could be handy for those who struggle not to spend their cash if it is in front of them. Is it safe? Squirrel is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. It says customer funds are never at risk as it is never lent but your money won’t be covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. One major downside is that while the tool helps you to build up a savings pot by helping making it harder to make impulse purchases and spend more than you are paid, your savings won’t benefit from any interest and neither will your squirrel account. To make the most of your savings you would therefore be best to move them to a traditional savings account regularly. Chip uses a clever algorithm to work out how much you  can  afford to save Chip – automatic savings What does it do?  The Chip app uses your spending habits to work out what you can afford to save without affecting your normal spending habits, siphoning off the money to a separate Chip account. The account benefits from interest of 1 per cent as standard but it pays an extra 1 per cent for every friend you recommend (up to a maximum of 5 per cent). How does it work? By granting read-only access to your online banking accounts when you sign up, Chip gathers information about your everyday spending. With the help of its algorithm the app then works out how much you can afford to save every few days without affecting your spending. It then diverts the cash into a separate account held with Barclays Bank. You can choose to save more or less at the touch of a button, pause the feature at any time and cancel individual payments if you choose. If you want to add more cash to your savings account you can move up to £100 per day but it has to be done manually. How much does it cost?  You can sign up using the app which is available to both Android and iOS users for free. It is compatible with bank accounts with NatWest, Halifax, Lloyds, Nationwide, Barclays, HSBC, First Direct, Santander, TSB, RBS, Metro Bank and Co-operative Bank.  Is it safe?   Chip is regulated by the FCA through its agency status with Prepaid Financial Services (PFS). Any money you save is held in a Barclays account and is separated off should Chip go bust, but it won't be protected under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. This means if Barclays goes out of business you won't get your money back. Chip is working on getting FSCS protection this year. The company is so confident in its algorithm that it says should any savings payment cause you to go into an overdraft it will replace the cash immediately, pay the bank charges and give you a £10 savings boost.  PensionBee - combines all your different pensions into one What does it do? PensionBee is aimed at people 'in the middle of their careers' who want to take control of their retirement saving Now that a job for life is almost a thing of the past, many people accumulate pension savings with various different providers, which become increasingly hard to keep track of as the years pass. PensionBee is aimed at people 'in the middle of their careers' who want to take control of their retirement saving. It will help you locate all of your different pots and manage them for you. Technically it's not an 'app' but it is optimised to be used on a mobile phone. How does it work? The first step is tracking down where all your pensions savings are. If you can't find them or don't have the time, give the app the names of your past and current employers and its 'beekeepers' will track them down for you.  The app then consolidates all of these savings plans in one place. You can see your current pot size, your projected retirement income, and set up regular or one-off contributions with a few clicks.  If there is an exit fee of more than £10, the app will let you know. Equally, if your old pension has guarantees, such as guaranteed annuity rates or a final salary promise, it promises to send you the all the relevant paperwork to consider before you transfer. If you have a pension with guaranteed benefits over £30,000, you are required to take financial advice from a transfer specialist before you transfer it. PensionBee does not provide financial advice and you will need to find an adviser. How much does it cost? The app itself is free and it doesn't charge anything to consolidate your pensions. But PensionBee does charge an annual fee of between 0.5 and 0.7 per cent of your total pension depending on how tailored a service you opt for. This includes underlying fees paid to the managers who invest your money. It claims the average cost of a managing a pension is 0.8 per cent, making this service quite competitive. Is it safe?  In terms of data protection, pretty safe as the app uses high level encryption to protect your personal details.  However, as with all pensions, your money is being invested - so there is a risk you could lose some or all of your money if those investments performed poorly.  If PensionBee were to go bust then your capital would be protected under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, with no upper limit. Savings goals - helps you build up cash for major life milestones What does it do?  Whether it's a wedding, university fees or a new home, we all have long-term goals that require some serious dosh. If you're saving for a long-term project or event then Savings Goals could be a handy addition to your phone.  Users can enter a target amount and a deadline by which they want to save How does it work? Users can enter a target amount and a deadline by which they want to save. The app will then calculate a savings schedule - how much you need to save each month or week - and tracks your progress. The app includes graphics to show you visually what proportion of your target you have saved, how long you have left until your target date and whether you are ahead or behind schedule.     How much does it cost? The app costs £2.99 and is available to download on the Apple Store.  Is it safe?  Safety isn't really an issue with this app as you aren't putting money in to it, just tracking your finances. However, you have the option of locking the app with an entry code if you wish.  Monzo - spending breakdowns and free to use abroad Monzo is one of This is Money’s favourites What does it do?  Monzo is one of This is Money’s favourites because it offers budgeting features and spending breakdowns built into your banking app. The bank currently offers an account with a prepaid Mastercard which you load with cash to spend. Although it doesn’t offer full current account features such as an overdraft, direct debits and standing orders yet, Monzo is working on it. Plus you won't pay to use the prepaid card to spend abroad, worldwide and another handy feature - if you misplace or lose your card the app will let you freeze it. How does it work?  The main draw of the Monzo card is that it is a great tool for helping you to budget. It breaks down your spending into catagories in the same way many of the individual budgeting apps do, with the bonus that it is automatic and requires you to add nothing extra. This means you can see exactly where you are spending your money with helpful information such as how much you spend on average in particular stores or chains or across more general categories such as travel or eating out. If you want you can add receipts to your purchases and there is the added bonus that unlike high-street banking apps which can take several days to update your balance, the Monzo app shows real-time balance updates.  How much does it cost?  The account has no monthly fee and the app is free to download on iOS and Android. Is it safe? Currently Monzo does not have FSCS protection, but your money is held in a separate Wirecard account which Monzo says is protected from creditors should Wirecard become insolvent.  Engage - budgeting envelopes and an ethical approach What does it do?  Would you bypass the banks altogether? The Engage Current Account is only available through credit unions New start up Engage is taking on the banks with a current account which offers virtual envelopes to separate out savings, money for bills and cash available to spend. The account - which you can only sign up for at a local credit union - also comes with no overdraft facility, avoiding hefty overdraft fees.  The account works in the same way as a typical current account, you get a visa debit card and the account allows direct debits and faster payments.  Another perk, it offers cashback of up to 15 per cent when swiping your debit card with certain retailers which it claims earns the average user between £3 and £5 a month.  You can read out full review of the account here.  How much does it cost? The cost of the Engage Current Account depends on where you open the account, but there is a minimum charge of £4.95.  There is also an extra charge of 75p for using an ATM to withdraw cash.  Is it safe? Engage’s accounts are classed as electronic money products and are therefore not protected by the FSCS. But the company does say: 'We ensure that any funds received by you are held in a segregated account so that in the unlikely event that Contis Financial Services Ltd becomes insolvent; your funds will be protected against claims made by creditors.' Habito recommends a lender and mortgage product based on the ‘true cost’ of the mortgage Habito - mortgage advice on your mobile What does it do? Habito's digital mortgage adviser uses artificial intelligence to provide customers with mortgage advice via a chat bot. It's not technically an app, but the site is designed to be used on your mobile. How does it work? They explore all the key components of your financial life - employment, attitude to risk, and personal life plans - and explain the impact of these factors on the kind of mortgage that will work best for you online or on your mobile. They then use real-time mortgage rates to calculate an indicative monthly payment, based on your circumstances and preferences.  Once you've been through the process with the chat bot, Habito recommends a specific lender and mortgage product based on the ‘true cost’ of the mortgage, meaning all fees, rates and additional costs are factored in. This recommendation also factors in how likely lenders are to accept your application based on whether you can afford the repayments. This is also done online or on your mobile. You are then put in touch with a mortgage adviser over the phone, who checks the recommendation before sending you the details by email.  How much does it cost? It's free to use and Habito won't charge you for the advice they give you. They earn a commission from the mortgage lender when you complete your mortgage. Is it safe? Most of Habito's customers engage with them via live chat, so as long as you're logged into to your Habito account you can upload documents directly to the chat. All data is encrypted and '100 per cent secure'.

Google May Ditch 3.5mm Headphone Jacks on Next Pixel Phones GO Google already started working on the Pixel 2 Mar 7, 2017 07:46 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Reports about the upcoming Pixel smartphone have already started surfacing, although the phone is expected to arrive sometime in October. Google has started working on the next Pixel phone and a recent report says that it might not have a 3.5mm headphone jack. An internal Google document was seen by 9to5Google and it suggested that the tech company might ditch the 3.5mm headphone jack on new Pixel smartphones. The actual documentation wasn’t shared and at this point, there aren’t any other reports suggesting the same move, so take this information with a grain of salt. The removal of the 3.5mm headphone jack would certainly be a bold move for Google, especially since the company highlighted the feature on Pixel and Pixel XL phones over Apple’s iPhone 7 offerings from last year. Pixel 2 will remain a premium smartphone Apple’s decision to remove the 3.5mm jack was criticized by some, but recent financial reports have shown that the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus were well received on the market, despite the fact that AirPods did record some delays at launch. If Google will indeed ditch the 3.5mm jack, then the company would have to offer wireless headphones or find an alternative for consumers. Google highlighting 3.5mm jack on Pixel phones Other recent reports say that Pixel 2 will come with waterproof certification, a feature that many Pixel owners would have wanted to have on their smartphones. In addition, Google has started testing multiple Pixel 2 models with a variety of chipsets, including Snapdragon 83X and Intel chips. At some point, the company even tested MediaTek chips, but has apparently decided not to go with such processors. The Pixel 2 might not see an increased MP size in the rear camera, but rather compensate in extra features. Pixel and Pixel XL phones released last year had some of the best cameras on a smartphone, being one of the main selling points for the two phones.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (2 Images) #Google#Pixel#Pixel XL#Pixel 2#3.5mm jack subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Google Pixel XL (2 Images) 01 02 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Google Releases March Security Update for Nexus and Pixel Devices Google Reportedly Working on Budget Phone Without Pixel Branding Google Assistant Could Soon Arrive on Apple's iPhone Google Assistant Starts Arriving on Eligible Nougat and Marshmallow Devices Third-Party Windows Updates Kind of Risky, Security Expert Says Google May Ditch 3.5mm Headphone Jacks on Next Pixel Phones AMD Rolls Out Its New Crimson ReLive Graphics Driver - Get Version 17.3.1 Google Play Celebrates Five Years, Here Are the Most Downloaded Games and Apps Samsung Confirms Delay of Android Nougat Update to Galaxy S6 and S6 edge Third-Party Windows Updates Kind of Risky, Security Expert Says Google May Ditch 3.5mm Headphone Jacks on Next Pixel Phones AMD Rolls Out Its New Crimson ReLive Graphics Driver - Get Version 17.3.1 2 photos    Pixel XL New Android APKs SecondScreen APK: Updated March 7th, 08:29 GMT NHL APK: Updated March 7th, 08:14 GMT Wire APK: Updated March 7th, 08:12 GMT Curiosity APK: Updated March 7th, 08:11 GMT Bubble Witch 3 Saga APK: Updated March 7th, 08:09 GMT Network Signal Guru APK: Updated March 7th, 08:07 GMT Wireless Audio-Multiroom (Tab) APK: Updated March 7th, 08:00 GMT Reader comments Galaxy Note 8 Codenamed “Great,” Samsung Still Working on Refurbished Note 7 more on: Samsung i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Hardware Image Source: crosathorian Get ready to make calls with Amazon’s Alexa Mike Wehner @MikeWehner March 3rd, 2017 at 10:10 PM Share Tweet Amazon’s hugely popular Alexa virtual assistant is already everywhere, and given her similarities to Apple’s Siri and Google Assistant, it was only a matter of time before she ended up connecting our phone calls, too. A new report from Recode suggests that’s exactly what is in the works at Amazon HQ, and that the company is preparing to debut at least one call-capable Alexa-enabled device by the end of 2017. Don't Miss: Two brand new Dave Chappelle stand-up specials will hit Netflix in March The report, which cites unnamed sources familiar with Amazon’s plans, claims that the new Alexa device will allow users to prompt a phone calls just by asking, but could also serve double duty as a long-distance intercom system. The intercom feature would essentially connect two Alexa users wherever they might be, kind of like a streamlined speakerphone. It’s an interesting concept, but the report falls short of answering a number of important questions about how the calling features would work, including whether or not users will have specific handles, or if Alexa will gain the ability to sync with a wireless number and mobile contact list in order to make the process as pain-free as possible. Amazon reportedly has at least one call-capable device in the beta testing phase. It’s worth noting that, thanks to last month’s announcement by Motorola during MWC, we already know that Alexa is headed to smartphones. The digital assistant is coming to Motorola’s Moto Z as a snap-on accessory, but will be fully integrated with future smartphones from the company which are coming later this year.

The CSC-owned IT industry research firm’s recent Telsyte Australian Tablet Market Study 2017 suggests that sales of tablet devices in Australia continued to rebound in the second half of 2016 with 1.64 million units sold. The local market saw a half year-on-half year increase of two per cent in tablet devices during the period, facilitated by a boom in convertible ‘2-in-1’ Windows tablet sales, which accounted for 27 per cent of all devices sold. Convertible ‘2-in-1’s now make up 30 per cent of sales, up from 15 per cent in the second half of 2015, the analyst firm said. Additionally, Microsoft’s Windows has almost overtaken Google’s Android as the most popular operating system for tablets in Australia, which retains 29 per cent, but is still behind the market leader, Apple with 44 per cent market share, according to Telsyte. Telsyte suggests that the trends it has observed in the local market point to a move away from sub-premium tablet devices, and an impending take-up of larger, more substantial touch-screen computing devices. “Tablets are no longer just about media consumption, touchscreen devices are revolutionising the creative experience,” Telsyte managing director, Foad Fadaghi, said. As such, the company expects to see the introduction of larger format, desktop touch computers, such as Microsoft’s Surface Studio. Telsyte expects this predicted trend to boost what it suggests is an otherwise sluggish PC market, with the local PC replacement cycle growing to 4.7 years. By 2021, according to Telsyte, at least 10 per cent of desktop PCs sold locally will have touch screen interfaces and, as screen prices come down, they are likely to become more pervasive.

Telsyte revealed that 80 per cent of the IT decision makers in Australia and New Zealand that it surveyed for the study indicated that they are already buying or interested in purchasing larger format touch screen computers for their organisation. Telsyte’s predictions echo previous comments by IDC, with the research firm in December last year suggesting that the global tablet market could rebound in 2018, albeit slowly, as detachable tablets continue to gain market share. "The transition to detachables is inevitable, but slate tablets will remain relevant as highlighted by recent results from Amazon with its Kindle Fire portfolio," said IDC tablets research director, Jean Philippe Bouchard, in December last year.

Many MSPs are seen to be stuck in the same comfort cycle of doing business within the few markets that they are comfortable in, but delivering stellar growth goes beyond doing just that; they need to take risks and branch out, or risk being gone. This exclusive ARN roundtable, in association with SolarWinds MSP, addressed key trends in the market for MSPs, diversifying areas of play – from SMB through to mid-market and enterprise, lucrative verticals, the importance of strategic alliances, as well as expanding into niche areas such as cybersecurity and ransomware and using them as a hook for customer conversations.

Now, six years later it has grown to over $50 million. "We've achieved this financial turnaround without cutting county services and in many departments we've actually increased existing services or added new services for county residents," McCoy said. Advertisement – Content Continues Below McCoy boasted cutting the County nursing home subsidy by half and announced that included in the $60 million dollar upgrade- a 911 dispatch center from the sheriff's department plans to be housed in the tower building, this all pending Department of Health approval. "So, with consolidations taking effect which we've done with Cohoes, Watervliet, Green Island and Coeymans we need more room," Albany County Sheriff Craig Apple said. The City of Albany may be added to that list as Mayor Kathy Sheehan confirms she has considered the merger to increase efficiency. Like McCoy, Sheehan says the city will work with the county to put vacant and abandoned properties in the land bank back back on the tax roll by committing one million dollars of funding to help individuals and/or businesses do just that. "Sometimes they just need that additional $10-15,000 of gap financing to make a project work and so we're there right alongside the county trying to provide that resource," Sheehan said. McCoy announced Albany will join other counties in a state lawsuit against pharmaceutical companies that didn't make the addictive nature of painkillers clearer to patients.  The county will also continue to combat opiod and heroin abuse with the creation of a task force. Members will be announced in the coming weeks. "This is where we need to get people involved from churches, neighborhoods, neighbors because that's only way were going to get to the root of the problem," McCoy said. He added that broadband services would also expand this year to rural communities like Berne and Knox.

A new report from Author Earnings doesn't completely answer the question, but it will help writers decide By Brady Dale • 03/06/17 11:38pm This is Barnes & Noble’s Nook. It probably won’t matter for a whole lot longer. Spencer Platt/Getty Images We have been closely following the ascent of indie publishing superstars here at the Observer. They aren’t yet driving the conversation at the New York Review of Books yet, but these writers do have their hands on the wheel of the actual economy of writing fiction. Lately, the best source of information on what’s going on in this new market is the website Author Earnings. It’s a joint venture between one of the most successful indie authors, Hugh Howey (whom we have talked to at length) and his collaborator, Data Guy, an anonymous number cruncher who devised the methodology for answering the questions Amazon won’t. Author Earnings just released a new report, and this one goes beyond Jeff Bezos’ baby, estimating total e-book sales at Apple, Google, Kobo and Barnes & Noble as well. We recently covered Data Guy’s report on the still growing market for e-books, despite wide media reports to the contrary. Thanks to this report’s wide view, Author Earnings is able to provide substantive guidance on whether or not indie authors should make titles available exclusively on Amazon or if they should go wide and sell them via every possible retailer. Books sold only through Amazon get invited to join the Kindle Unlimited program, the company’s Netflix for e-books. In fact, Amazon pays authors in that program more money than non-exclusive authors earn in all the other channels combined, the report explains. But it’s not quite that simple. The report also says: “’Wide’ authors who are able to effectively take advantage of promotional opportunities at other retailers often see far more than the a quarter of their sales coming through non-Amazon channels; some high profile indies are doing so well at other retailers that Amazon now represents less than half of their sales.” The further points out that the Amazon market can be fickle. Indie books’ market share there took a nose dive through part of last year, though they have also largely recovered. Other sources of revenue can smooth overall income streams. Sci-fi scribe Howey told us that he experimented with both wide release and exclusivity, finding he made far more money and reached far more people by gaining access to the Kindle Unlimited audience. While romance superstar Marie Force told us that she would never close a road by which a new reader could find her work. The two stances illustrate the question facing every indie author. Amazon is by far the largest market for e-books and, if it Kindle Unlimited were its own company, it would be the third largest e-book seller. “To completely ignore a retail channel of that size makes zero sense,” the report contends. On the other hand, writers without a following may feel they can ill afford skipping any market. There’s more than enough money changing hands on any of the major channels to afford any writer a very good living if they can only attain a small piece of any one. Author Earnings muddies the waters by noting that “if a title appeals to Canadian or Australian audiences, it will be unavailable in the retailer channels where almost half of those countries’ e-book purchases occur.” Author Earnings ultimately settles on a recommendation that can only work for writers who have more than a few books out: Put some into Kindle Unlimited and go wide with others. When an author blows up on one channel, readers who like the book that becomes popular often want to go back and read the rest, as another popular sci-fi writer, Christopher Nuttall, explained for us. But if a book becomes popular in Apple’s iBooks, readers won’t be able to buy the writer’s Kindle Unlimited books there. On the other hand, Amazon only requires exclusivity in three month increments. So a writer could wait for that window to end, then add the books they held back to the other pools once they can. Even if they lose money in the short term by leaving the Kindle Unlimited pool, it could be worth it in the long run to solidify new fans. If it’s your first book: flip a coin. The report provides a number of interesting insights about the market for e-books across the English speaking world. For example, while Amazon dominates all of these markets, Kobo is putting up a respectable fight for the $136 million spent on e-books in Canada, and Apple is making a strong showing for the $126 million market in Australia (the US e-book market represents more than $3.2 billion). Be sure to have a look at the report itself for other insights. Author Earnings derives its data by scraping the sales ranking data off of various e-book retailers sites and correlating that with final sales data shared with those that run Author Earnings. These two pools of information allow it to derive estimates for all e-books sold. More on its methodology can be seen here.

"The cornerstone of what we do every day is working to improve the quality of life for those facing poverty, racism and discrimination," said McCoy, who is in his sixth term. "The plan we have in hand will guide us as we strive to improve access and the quality of programs for people in Albany County." Building on previous plans to adopt an "Equity Agenda" to more effectively provide social and humans services, McCoy said the county will move forward on improving access to county departments. "Access to services for rural residents is an issue," he said. Social services as well as health and mental health agencies have invested time and resources in providing services in communities that are traditionally difficult to reach, he said. This includes plans in the towns of Knox and Berne to provide internet services, he said. Bringing services to rural communities falls in line with Sheriff Craig Apple's plan to provide county department services in the Clarksville Elementary School. "The county has a lot of services to offer," Apple said. "I just think we should have them in areas accessible to all residents and I think Clarksville is that solution." McCoy said the county health and mental health departments will work with the new Opioid Task Force on strategies to confront the crisis of opioid abuse. Last year, the executive announced that the heroin antidote naloxone, commonly known as Narcan, would be available for sale without a prescription in pharmacies across the county. He also wants County Attorney Dan Lynch to hold pharmaceutical companies accountable for their failure "to adequately warn and instruct of the dangers have caused enormous loss, pain and suffering in our county." As part of the $60 million renovation plans for the county nursing home in Colonie, McCoy said the county's 911 dispatch would move to the complex along with other county departments. The executive re-emphasized the need for state lawmakers and Gov. Andrew Cuomo to shoulder the cost of providing indigent legal services currently borne by county governments. While measures passed both houses of the State Legislature, Cuomo vetoed the measure. "I remain concerned that we are perpetuating a two-tier system of justice in the county and in the state," McCoy said. "The message continues to resonate and we are working with our partners to make sure our leaders acknowledge the problem and provide hope for defendants in New York. The state has a constitutional obligation that it continues to pass on to counties." afries@timesunion.com • 518-454-5353 • @mandy_fries News Videos Most Popular 1 Brian Cody, Chrissy Cavotta leaving WFLY for WGNA 2 Brian Cody, Chrissy Cavotta leaving WFLY for WGNA 3 Siena rallies to stun Monmouth in MAAC Tournament 4 Neighbors tried to save Schenectady woman lit on fire 5 WNYT's Jason Gough shares story of childhood sex abuse to help... 6 Dryer 'exploded,' starting Colonie fire 7 SEEN: SPAC Winter Ball 2017 View Comments © 2017 Hearst Communications, Inc.

Frankel, Tracy Jan, The Washington Post, 07 March 2017 Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Highlights Tech companies were among the loudest critics of Trump's travel ban The top H-1B visa sponsor last year was Infosys Trump said last week he wanted to move toward a "merit based" visa system President Donald Trump signed a new, seemingly softened travel ban Monday, but the reaction from Silicon Valley sounded very much the same. "Our sentiment has not changed: President Trump's immigration ban is unjust and wrong," Uber, the ride-hailing company, said in a statement. "Barring people from entering our country because of where they're from was wrong the first time around - still wrong..." tweeted Airbnb chief executive Brian Chesky. A month ago, technology companies were among the loudest critics of Trump's initial travel ban, which immediately imposed restrictions on visas for visitors from seven countries. A national uproar followed. More than 100 tech companies - including Apple, Google and Microsoft - signed onto a court brief supporting one of the several court cases filed against the ban. Trump's new travel ban is aimed at avoiding these legal challenges. It imposes a 90-day ban on new visas for citizens from six Muslim-majority countries. It is scheduled to take effect in 10 days. But Silicon Valley's core objections were not assuaged by the new language. "I think we're going to see the same fight," said Neil Ruiz of George Washington University's Center for Law, Economics, and Finance. "And for employers, a lot of uncertainty." Adding to tech companies' worries, the Trump administration announced Friday that it would temporarily stop allowing expedited applications for H-1B visas - a change that is seen as a prelude to a broader overhaul of a visa system widely used by tech companies to hire foreign workers. The visa program has been criticized by both Republicans and Democrats as a way for companies to hire cheaper foreign workers, displacing American ones. In December, Trump said one of his first executive orders would be to order an investigation into visa abuses. That executive order still has not been signed. The US Citizenship and Immigration Services (UCIS) said it will stop "premium processing" beginning April 3 for up to six months. The faster handling cut wait times for H-1B visas from a few months to as little as 15 days. The agency said the change was needed to handle a significant surge in "premium processing" requests in recent years and to allow more time to address older visa requests. These two actions by Trump's administration have stirred a high level of anxiety among chief executives and their workers, said Ali Noorani, executive director of the National Immigration Forum, a DC-based lobby group. "Frankly there is just a lack of stability within our economy right now because of these actions," Noorani said. The Trump administration, he said, is "making it pretty clear to the nation's companies that depend upon immigration that we are going to close the American economy off from the world - either by action or by tone." He said the full range of Trump's immigration-related orders will undermine how companies grow in the US, and impact whether companies see the US as a place they want to conduct business. The industries affected by Trump's broad rhetoric and actions include tech, health care, higher education and agriculture. Idaho dairy producers, for example, depend heavily upon immigrant workers to milk half a million cows each day, Noorani said. An increasing number of workers there are refugees. "How is a dairy farmer in Idaho going to operate in this environment?" But some scholars studying immigrant visas and the American workforce believe the impact of the H-1B visa decision is being overblown. The government had previously suspended premium processing for two months in 2015 when spouses of certain visa holders became eligible to work and their applications needed to be processed in a timely manner, said Ron Hira, a public policy professor at Howard University specializing in high-skill immigration and the American engineering workforce. "There have been a lot of complaints over the years that USCIS isn't properly checking credentials," said Hira, whose book "Outsourcing America," examines the economic and policy implications of the offshoring of high-skilled jobs. "Stories of fake resumes have been increasing over the last few years." Hira also said that Trump's renewed ban impacts a very small number of H-1B visa applicants from those countries. The countries affected by Trump's ban account for less than half a percent of H-1B visas approved in 2013, he said. The top H-1B visa sponsor last year was Infosys, an Indian multinational corporation providing information technology and outsourcing services. It filed 25,405 applications, according to Myvisajobs.com. An Infosys spokesman said Monday the company is not commenting on Trump's executive order. Trump said during his joint address to Congress last week that he wanted to move toward a "merit based" visa system. He has said he wants to investigate whether the current visa system is hurting American workers. Lynden Melmed, an immigration attorney who had served as UCIS chief counsel within the Department of Homeland Security under President George W. Bush, said eliminating expedited processing could bring major disruption for workers and companies. Applicants are barred from traveling while a change in visa status is pending, so an increase in processing time could prevent foreign graduates of US universities from leaving the country or be stuck outside while they are waiting for approval, Melmed said. "They are taking away the escape hatch for people who can't wait for regular processing times," said Melmed, who also serves as executive counsel for Compete America, a coalition of mostly tech companies advocating for immigration reform to benefit high-skilled foreign workers. Employers will be watching the clock closely. Current regulation grants workers whose H-1B visa status is set to expire an automatic eight-month extension. Without expedited processing, those employees will not be allowed to work if their new H-1B visa is not granted within those eight months. "The time frame for when an employee can start or whether they can continue working is now taken out of the company's hands and subject entirely to government processing times," Melmed said. © 2017 The Washington Post Tags: Donald Trump, Trump Immigration Ban, Travel Ban, Silicon Valley, H 1B Visa Google Vows Fix for 'Inappropriate' Featured Snippet Search Results on Google Home TRAI Takes Measures to Provide Fair Deal to TV Channel Subscribers Trump's New Travel Ban Raises the Same Silicon Valley Objections     Advertisement   In Mobiles and Tablets Latest iVoomi iV505 Swipe Elite Sense Intex Aqua Strong 5.1+ Panasonic Eluga Pulse X Panasonic Eluga Pulse Samsung Galaxy Xcover 4 Zopo Flash X Plus General Mobile GM 6 Xiaomi Redmi 4X Xiaomi Mi 5c ZTE Nubia N1 lite ZTE Blade V8 Lite ZTE Blade V8 Mini Gionee A1 Alcatel U5 Alcatel A5 LED Alcatel A3 Sony Xperia XA1 Sony Xperia XA1 Ultra Sony Xperia XZs Popular Samsung Galaxy S8 Moto M Oppo A57 Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 Nokia 6 OnePlus 3T Google Pixel Google Pixel XL Motorola Moto Z Moto Z Play Lenovo K5 Note Xiaomi Redmi 3s HTC 10 Xiaomi Mi5 Galaxy J7 2016 Micromax phones Samsung phones Android Phones Smartphones Google Phones Nokia Phones Honor 6X Gadgets 360 Hindi रिलायंस जियो नंबर को 31 मार्च से पहले या बाद में बंद करने का तरीका टेलीकॉम कंपनियों ने किया है अब 300 रुपये का धमाका आईफोन 7, आईफोन 7 प्लस पर 10,001 रुपये तक की छूट Latest Videos 02:43 360 Daily: Samsung Galaxy A5, Galaxy A7 (2017) Launched, Nexflix on Set-Top Boxes, and More 01:41 'Notes Ban Did Impact Small Businesses': MobiKwik CEO To NDTV 03:55 Nintendo Switch, Legend of Zelda, Ghost Recon Wildlands, and Other Games Coming in March 2017 06:06 PS4, PS4 Slim, or PS4 Pro: Which PlayStation 4 is Right for You? 02:02 360 Daily: Reliance Jio's Buy One Get One Offer, Google Pixel 2 Releasing This Year, and More More Videos» OPINIONS ALL AUTHORS Gopal Sathe Streaming Devices Still Leave a Lot to Be Desired Kunal Dua Nokia 3310: What's in a Name?

March 6, 2017 7:01 PM   Subscribe Looking for a job as a data scientist in Seattle. I have a few years' experience doing this already and want to be picky about my next gig. Main criteria: in Seattle city limits, not terribly evil, decent work-life balance. More details after the jump. What I'm looking for: * In Seattle city limits - so not Microsoft. * Not terribly evil - so not Amazon, Uber, most banks. * Good work-life balance - so not Facebook or Apple (this is a problem with some otherwise ideal nonprofit employers as well) * A place where I can keep using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques and tools and work on interesting problems. Did I mention I'm picky? But still, I know there are at least some places that satisfy most/all of the criteria above. If you have any employers to suggest, especially if you can share any direct/indirect experience with them, I'd be very grateful! posted by splitpeasoup to Work & Money (15 answers total) 3 users marked this as a favorite   What about The Allen Institute? posted by Altomentis at 7:08 PM on March 6 [2 favorites] I know data scientists at Facebook Seattle and they work a strict 9-5, which I would consider pretty decent work-life balance. Maybe give it another look? The benefits are fantastic as well. posted by joan_holloway at 7:12 PM on March 6 [1 favorite] I have many friends at Facebook in regular engineering roles, and they don't work crazy hours for the most part. I second the suggestion to re-examine. I also know people who have worked at the Fred Hutch and it sounded like a pretty laid-back place, though I'm sure that depends on where you end up within the center. posted by primethyme at 7:16 PM on March 6 [2 favorites] Can you elaborate on what sort of data scientist you are? My brother recently sent me some blog post of the kind that I'd normally roll my eyes at, which broke down data scientists into "people who make things consumed by machines" and "people who make things consumed by people" which was a distinction that would have simplified my last job search. Put another way, do you definitely belong in the engineering organization? Or do you definitely belong on the product side? Or do you straddle an in-between ground? (Since we're all talking about Facebook, I think people at Facebook whose title is "data scientist" live on the product side. Their engineering doppelgängers are called "machine learning engineer", IIRC.) posted by hoyland at 7:19 PM on March 6 Google has some data science folks in their Seattle (not Kirkland) office. Work-life balance is quite sane, or so I hear. posted by matildatakesovertheworld at 7:27 PM on March 6 You will find Tableau and Google along with several other firms in the Fremont neighborhood. Nice little cluster of math related development in that section of the city. posted by ptm at 7:30 PM on March 6 [2 favorites] I didn't realize people could work a 40 hour week at Facebook. I've also thought of it as a little more evil than I'd love. Maybe I should reexamine on both counts. Allen Institute, Fred Hutch, and Google are great suggestions; would love to hear personal experiences people have had there. Re the dichotomy hoyland mentions above, I "make things consumed by machines" for the most part. posted by splitpeasoup at 8:59 PM on March 6 Disney has offices in downtown Seattle and they're big on work-life balance. I just looked and there are some data analyst and data science positions open. posted by erst at 9:37 PM on March 6 Indeed is hiring data scientists in downtown Seattle. Link. I think it's a pretty cool, and non-evil, place to work. (Disclaimer: I work there, although I'm neither in Seattle nor a data scientist.) posted by teraflop at 9:48 PM on March 6 Lyft has an office here, and you can help keep The People's Less Evil choice less evil. posted by batter_my_heart at 9:56 PM on March 6 No clue what you do but is Bellevue out of the question? Salesforce just consolidated into its new building there. By most accounts a great company culture. I guess these offices have an engineering emphasis. posted by AnOrigamiLife at 10:00 PM on March 6 Healthdata.org might be of interest. posted by k8t at 10:46 PM on March 6 I'm a developer rather than a data science guy, but my current workplace (RealSelf) might fit the bill. Pioneer Square area, definitely not in the same orbit as Amazon/Uber/Facebook ethics-challenge-wise, *very* reasonable work-life balance, and while I'm not sure how much machine-learning we're using so far on that side (We're working on integrating it more on the development side, at least), the social/community dynamics of what we do are absolutely fascinating to me. Current Data Science posting General Jobs page - Definitely feel free to MeMail me questions, look around GlassDoor or whatever sort of workplace-review rankings you trust, etc. We're fairly regularly adding to the data science side of things, so I'm sure between this and future positions there'll be a ready demand. And if you do end up wanting to apply, let me know and I can see about getting your application more directly in front of someone. posted by CrystalDave at 11:12 PM on March 6 What about the health/non-profit sector? The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and PATH are both based in Seattle, plus several others I'm sure. BMGF funds a lot of non-evil tech. posted by emd3737 at 11:30 PM on March 6 The tiny startup I work for is looking for a data scientist to join us in 3-4 months, but I'm hazy on the finer details and obviously it's not an immediate opening. It does tick your boxes for not-evil (medical training) and cutting-edge tech (VR) though!

The big question about this rumor is obvious: Would you still consider purchasing the “Pixel 2” if it didn’t have a headphone jack? One of the first major OEMs to remove the headphone jack was Lenovo with the release of the Moto Z and Moto Z Force. While many didn’t pay attention to those phones, some tech enthusiasts were surprised (and you could say very upset) when rumors started circulating that Apple would remove the port from the then-upcoming (and very mainstream) iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. When Google unveiled the Pixel and Pixel XL, the company semi-openly mocked Apple for removing the 3.5mm port. The Pixel having a way for users to use wired headphones without a dongle was a selling point, but now that Google is looking forward and designing its next flagship, the headphone jack just might just be going by the wayside. So what do you think? Would you still purchase the Pixel 2 if it didn’t have a headphone jack? Answer the poll below and let us know your thoughts in the comments!

Indonesia, March 6, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- In two weeks' time, from March 22-24, CPhI SEA is set to open its doors at Jakarta International Expo, offering to over 260 exhibitors the only dedicated pharma trading platform for the region. Sign up today! In a sprawling archipelago made up of 17,000 islands and sometimes difficult land connections, the digital revolution will soon transform the way people access healthcare. In the short term, the greatest disruption will come from telemedicine, facilitated by a growing array of apps that give patients direct access to GPS and subsequently order medicines for home delivery, directly on their mobile phones. Examples of local players already offering the service are Halo Doc, Apotik Antar, and Alo Dokter. Continue Reading UBM Logo Apotik Antar mobile services Andy Richards, an investor in digital health, in the last issue of The Economist ("A digital revolution in health care is speeding up") argues that three groups are fighting a war for control of the "health-care value chain". One group comprises "traditional innovators" -- pharmaceutical firms, hospitals and medical-technology companies such as GE Healthcare, Siemens, Medtronic and Philips. A second category is made up of "incumbent players", which include health insurers, pharmacy-benefit managers (which buy drugs in bulk), and as single-payer health-care systems. The third group are the technology "insurgents", including Google, Apple, Amazon and a host of hungry entrepreneurs that are creating apps, predictive-diagnostics systems and new devices. In emerging economies, where regulations on health data are less onerous and where people often already expect to pay to see a doctor, faster growth and innovation is in the making. These and related topics will be discussed at CPhI SEA in 2 weeks' time. Tailored to suit this fast-changing industry, the 6th edition of CPhI South East Asia, taking place during 22-24 March 2017 in Jakarta, provides the must-attend trade exhibition where the regional pharma industry meets to leverage connections, knowledge and insight to spur business. Sign up now to attend!

In addition to this, the company stated that major international brands such as Apple, Reckitt Benckiser, Estee Lauder and sanitary fittings manufacturer, Grohe, also became official vendors on Jumia Nigeria in 2016. “As manufacturers and retailers alike continue to champion self-sustaining business processes, Jumia, Nigeria’s largest online retailer, gathered 2,000 Small and Medium Enterprise owners from its platform for an interactive conference,” the Chief Executive Officer, Jumia Nigeria, Juliet Anammah, said. Anammah said that discussions revolved around innovative ideas to drive sales and better processes for enhanced customer experience in Nigeria. She explained to the Small and Medium Enterprise owners the importance of taking advantage of Jumia’s vendor support system to boost their business sales “Though the beginning of the year has been tough, the economic recession will not impede sales. There are continuous opportunities for our vendors to tap into specially designed activities that will increase their sales and deliver to our shoppers repeated purchases at very competitive prices,” she said. It was gathered that the event also marked the launch of the brand new Jumia online vendor forum, and sellers got a preview of the upcoming mega events of 2017, such as Jumia Mobile Week, Jumia Black Friday and TV Mega Blast, among others. One of such specialised programmes for Jumia sellers is the ‘Top Seller Rewards’ programme. When customers shop on Jumia, they are encouraged to rate the service and quality of products received. “That customer feedback translates into a seller score for the vendors. Vendors who consistently maintain a top rating, then receive benefits such as low commissions, faster payment terms, invitation to the VIP events and more,” Anammah added.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Tuesday, 7 March 2017 | MYT 8:30 AM Retro computers: How to game like in the good old days Blast from the past: This Amiga 500 from Commodore arrived on the market in 1987 and boasts its very own disc drive. — dpa Mario and Pac-Man first hit our screens in the early 80s. Much has changed since then, but retro gaming fans remain devoted to the computers of the past.  It’s a journey into another age. Retro gaming – playing old games from the early PC and console era on the old devices – has won over many nostalgic fans eager to return to the 16-bit days.  Venerable old machines like the Amiga 500, the Commodore 64 and the early Apple computers are all the rage with these fans. Europe's largest games fair Gamescom even devotes an area to retro gaming, including new games for the decades-old devices.  So where should someone start if they want to venture back into the home computing past? Andreas Lange, director of the Computer Games Museum in Berlin, recommends the mid-80s.  "If I want to start with a computer I want to play, then it’s the 16-bit computers and upwards," he says. For example, that includes classics like the Amiga 500 or Atari ST, whose their graphical user interfaces make them easier to use.  Retro PC gaming is also a hobby that can be picked up on a comparatively low budget.  For buying and selling old computers, Lange recommends eBay or the local flea market. "You can still pick up one or two bargains there," he says.  "The common systems are very cheap," says Lange. A complete and well-preserved C64 with additional hardware can be bought for around US$100 (RM445), an Atari ST for slightly more.  The accessories are at least as important as the computer itself. "Cables, power supply, the drives and also a mouse all need to be connected," Lange says.  Some of the old computers can be connected to a TV, but that’s likely to be problematic with modern televisions. For that reason, Lange recommends buying a monitor or an old TV as well.  Of course, you also need some games. But here you need to exercise caution.  If playing on a floppy disk or data tape, you can no longer assume that the code is still 100% intact "because the magnetic voltage weakens bit by bit," Lange says.  Inside the computers themselves, the things to look out for are the capacitors and the backup batteries, says Peter Knaak from German consumer goods tester Stiftung Warentest.   They can leak or simply lose their ability to hold a charge.  "These are the biggest weaknesses," he says.  It is possible to replace them if you have a talent for tinkering, and you can find plenty of information online on how to fix common problems in classic computers. There’s also the option of finding a local repair café where volunteers offer their services.  And if you just want to experience old software without going to the trouble of obtaining old hardware, you can always run a C64 or Atari emulation on a modern mini-PC such as a Raspberry Pi or Arduino.  These emulations play an important role in keeping old games alive, Lange says, because "when it comes to the long-term preservation of computer games, we cannot assume that these systems will still function in 40 to 50 years." — dpa Related Stories You May Be Interested Malaysian shuttlers safe after an eventful flight to Birmingham Pyongyang bans Malaysians from leaving N.

By Tas Bindi | March 7, 2017 -- 01:06 GMT (17:06 PST) | Topic: Hardware Australian tablet sales have continued to trend upwards with 1.64 million units sold in the second half of 2016, up 2 percent from the previous corresponding period, according to a new study by analyst firm Telsyte. Telsyte attributes the increase to rising 2-in-1 Windows tablet sales, which accounted for 27 percent of tablets sold in 2H 2016. Slightly ahead is Android, which accounted for 29 percent of sales, while Apple remains the leader with 44 percent market share. Latest Australian news Commonwealth on the hunt for new Medicare payments system Blockchain standards need definition agreement first: Standards Australia ​Silicon Valley veteran schools Sydney startups on success Centrelink admits trawling social media for complaints Optus and Huawei attain 665Mbps speeds across 16 devices with Massive MIMO Sales of Windows tablets grew an estimated 60 percent from 2H 2015 to 2H 2016, while Android tablet and iPad sales slid 13 percent and 9 percent, respectively. Convertible 2-in-1s across all brands and operating systems made up 30 percent of tablet sales, up from 15 percent in 2H 2015. According to Telsyte's Australian Tablet Market Study 2017, Australians are moving "significantly" away from sub-premium or low-cost tablets, with sales of these tablets estimated to have made up less than 10 percent in 2H 2016. Additionally, around 40 percent of Australians surveyed by Telsyte indicated they are willing to pay more for "top quality electronics". The market for tablet-related accessories continues to be a profitable category for retailers, Telsyte's study found, with 71 percent of tablet users having purchased some form of accessory for their device. The top add-ons in 2016 were cases and keyboard-type covers, while sales of pen input or stylus devices featured prominently for owners of 2-in-1 devices. Currently, Australian tablet users spend on average two hours per day on their tablets, with primary usage still being at home (over 80 percent). The average time spent on 2-in-1 devices is more than three hours per day and over 30 percent of Australians use them outside of home. In October last year, internet usage on smartphones and tablets exceeded desktop usage for the first time, accounting for 51.3 percent of worldwide internet usage compared to 48.7 percent via desktop, according to statistics from web analytics firm StatCounter. Telsyte expects the introduction of larger format, desktop touch computers such as Microsoft's Surface Studio to boost what it describes as the "sluggish" PC market that has struggled to give users a reason to upgrade. Telsyte estimates that the average replacement cycle for PCs in Australia has now grown to 4.7 years. At present, desktop touch computers resonate more with creative professionals, businesses, and high-end households than the mainstream buyer, Telsyte said. However, the analyst firm expects PCs with touchscreen interfaces to become more pervasive as prices come down. Around 80 percent of ICT decision makers in Australia and New Zealand surveyed by Telsyte indicated that they are already buying or interested in buying larger format touch screen computers for their organisation.

Apple’s iPhone 7 debuted without one and with the Moto Z following suit in the realm of Android, many enthusiasts were afraid that manufacturers like Samsung and LG would follow lock-step behind Apple in this decision. Both the upcoming LG G6 and the Samsung Galaxy S8 will feature a headphone jack, but if a recent rumor is to be believed it may be Google that falls in behind Apple first. 9to5Google is reporting that the next-generation Pixel flagship phone won’t feature a headphone jack, according to internal documents seen by the site. It’s worth noting that they weren’t able to verify this rumor with multiple sources, however. According to Stephen Hall, the language in the document presents the removal of the headphone jack as matter-of-fact, as if this is something Google’s been considering for a while. If this development turns out to be true it’s rather ironic, considering the inclusion of the 3.5mm headphone jack was one of the marketing bullet points in the first Pixel ad. local_offer    Google   Pixel   Pixel 2   Pixel XL   Auto-load comments: Off On View comments (21) stars Further Reading Fake news sites are making Google Home unreliable Google Play Store celebrates its 5th birthday The March security update is released for the Verizon Pixel Google's budget Pixel 2 may come to Android One HP and Google announce a new Chromebook for students stars Popular this Weeklaunch 1 more_vertOnePlus 5 rumors closeOnePlus 5 may have curved display, 256GB of storage, and a 23MP camera A couple of new rumors out of Korea shed some light on the OnePlus 5.

Elyse Betters7 March 2017Apps Yahoo Captain is Yahoo's SMS-based digital assistant It works with all US carriers that accept SMS short codes Just text 'hi' to 773-786 to get started using Captain Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment Despite a pending sale to Verizon and an investigation into its data breaches, Yahoo had the time to make an assistant. Called Captain, it's one of the cooler services Yahoo has put out in recent years. It's not a voice-activated assistant or anything like that. Instead, it is a new take on how we use artificial intelligence to manage our busy schedules. And you don't need to download or even use a dedicated app to take advantage of its useful features. You simply talk to Captain over text. Here's everything you need to know about it. Yahoo confirms state-sponsored hack: Were you affected? Yahoo: What is Captain? Captain is an SMS-based digital assistant, though Yahoo has described it as "a bot assistant that streamlines family logistics through text  without downloading any app". It primarily combines text with group reminders and shared shopping lists in real-time. Yahoo: So, Captain is an assistant? Although it is considered an assistant, Captain is obviously not as powerful as Apple's Siri or Amazon's Alexa or Google Assistant. The neatest thing about the service is that it acts as an intermediary between you and other people in your family. The point here is to lessen some of the burden around having to manage your life, your spouse's schedule, and your kids' activities. For instance, you can text Captain to remind your husband that your daughter needs to be picked up at 3pm, and it'll also remind your daughter that her dad is coming to get her soon. Yahoo said Captain helps your family stay organized by keeping shared reminders, grocery lists, to-do lists, and more for your entire family. You can learn more from the Yahoo Captain website. Yahoo: How does Captain work? Getting started Simply text “hi” to the number 773-786 to get started using Captain. You'll then have to accept the terms, and then Captain will walk you through how to update a shared shopping list, set reminders, and add family members to the group. Invite members To invite family members, text “add member [name]” to 773-786. For instance, you can text “add member Stuart”, and then Captain will send you the instructions to invite Stuart to the group. You can learn more about adding family members here. Reminders and shared lists Your family can add, remove, and query shared lists and reminders through text messages. You can, for instance, text Captain at 776-786 to set up a timed reminder for your son to pick up the dry cleaning on Sunday. See the full list of supported commands here. Yahoo: Where is Captain available? Captain works with all US mobile carriers that accept SMS short codes. Yahoo: Does Captain cost anything? Captain is free to use. However, standard text rates apply. If you have unlimited texting, you shouldn’t see any charges for using Captain. Yahoo: Is this safe? Yahoo recently admitted to two massive data breaches, so you're probably wondering if Captain is safe. The first thing to keep in mind is that Captain is used entirely through text messaging, so there’s no Yahoo account required. Captain will also only share your list and reminders with people in your group. It does collect information that you provide to set up profiles, including names, phone numbers, and email addresses, but it only keeps "anonymised user dialogs for training models and product improvements". Also, although Captain doesn't integrate with any other calendar, list, or reminder app, it does store your family’s shopping list and shared reminders. See the Security at Yahoo webpage more information about Yahoo's various security steps. Want to know more? Check out Captain's FAQ page.

Via the BookBub discount eBook service, readers who want to get a deeply discounted digital copy of the novel can do so for Apple, Google, Barnes & Noble's Nook, and more. Here's how the publisher describes the novel, a middle-reader book that was first announced in late 2013: “A fast-paced, action-filled superhero adventure” (School Library Journal) from the legendary writer who revolutionized Marvel Comics: When a dangerous villain plots to steal the Zodiac’s powers, Stephen has to find a way to bring his teammates together — or face disaster! The Zodiac series are illustrated prose novels that follow Steven Lee, a young Chinese-American teen who is drawn into a mysterious conspiracy surrounding twelve mystical pools of energy and a power-hungry secret organization. When he and other teens around the world are suddenly gifted with magical powers, they have to find each other and learn how to handle fantastic abilities and responsibilities. Their greatest hopes and deepest fears will be brought to light by the powers of the zodiac! Working from a core concept pitched by Lee and POW! Entertainment and developed with Disney Publishing Worldwide, SVP and Group Publisher Jeanne Mosure appointed acquiring editor Nachie Marsham to the project, who ultimately paired Moore and Tong with Lee. “I’m thrilled to be working with Disney Publishing Worldwide with whom I always hoped to develop this project," said Lee at the time of the announcement. "Our partnership has been enormously fruitful, collaborative and great fun.” Adds Mosure, “It’s a dream come true to be involved with this fantastic creative team, launching a compelling new property and introducing a rich new world to middle-grade readers through this unique book.” As with nearly everything Lee has created in recent years, it was developed with an eye toward other media adaptations to film, TV, and video games. The first Zodiac novel debuted in 2015.

The iPhone 7, with the current LCD display. Image: Lili sams/mashable By Brett Williams2017-03-06 22:59:26 UTC One of the biggest expectations we have for the upcoming iPhone 8 is an edge-to-edge OLED screen—but if a new supply chain rumor is true, that's just the first step in Apple's master plan. A recent report claims every iPhone model will adopt OLED screens by 2019, according an article in The Bell spotted by MacRumors. OLED technology requires less power than LCD displays and produces brighter colors.  If Apple does make a full-on move to OLED, LCD producers, some of which have been experimenting with more flexible designs to stay relevant in the increasingly curvy smartphone ecosystem, could be cut off from the iPhone entirely.     SEE ALSO: Apple's new 'Apple Park' spaceship campus will open in April Apple will make 60 million iPhone 8 units with OLED displays this year—about 40 percent of their 2017 production overall, according to the report. They'll double that next year, when presumably one lower-tier version of the iPhone will stick with an LCD display, and OLED will ultimately become the standard across all iPhone lines in 2019. A few new iPhones are supposedly coming this year: The aforementioned iPhone 8 with OLED, and iPhone 7S and 7S Plus units that will retain LCD displays and serve as incremental updates to last year's 7 model.  Meanwhile, the iPhone 8 could be chock full of updates like the OLED display, some sort of new sensor system, a function area embedded into the screen to replace the home button for Touch ID, and wireless charging. All those updates could push the phone's cost above $1,000, though — so the 7S and 7S Plus could still have their fair share of fans.  BONUS: A new way to take selfies — and six other features the iPhone 8 might have Topics: Apple, display, iphone 8, LCD, Mobile, OLED, rumors, supply chain, Tech About Us Jobs Advertise Subscribe Privacy Terms Mashable is a global, multi-platform media and entertainment company.

The Amsterdam-based mapping company is already working on traffic management systems with engineering giant Siemens AG, roadworks monitoring company Elgin and transport planning specialist PTV AG, and is seeking more such tie-ups, Chief Executive Officer Harold Goddijn said in an interview. Harold Goddijn Photographer: Jasper Juinen/Bloomberg “We don’t control the whole value chain, we don’t do traffic lights, we don’t do big traffic control centers, but we have a lot of smart technology,” Goddijn said. TomTom and its peers have come into increasing focus as the automotive industry races to build autonomous vehicles. With carmakers wary about leaning on tech behemoths such as Alphabet Inc.’s Google, they have instead turned to others to supply the mapping data essential to developing so-called self-driving cars. In 2015 Nokia Oyj sold its HERE mapping business to a consortium consisting of Volkswagen AG, BMW AG and Daimler AG for 2.6 billion euros ($2.7 billion). Alternative Revenue Traffic management systems could become an attractive source of revenue. While at present they are used by cities to manage congestion by controlling traffic lights and other hardware to try to prevent blockages, the advent of autonomous driving means that centralized, cloud-based infrastructure management may play a greater role.  TomTom currently supplies that technology to places such as Berlin, Zurich and Amsterdam in many cases free of charge, which provides insight to local transport authorities. In return, the cities supply TomTom with traffic data it can use to improve its products, which it licenses to technology companies including Apple Inc. and Uber Technologies Inc.  Goddijn said TomTom gets data from half a billion sources each day. “Uber is very much relying on our technology and our data for routing, for traffic information,“ Goddijn said. “We have a vast amount of data and experience, which helps them to tune their algorithms.” Cash, Headcount TomTom doesn’t have the cash riches of other companies to pile into its mapping efforts. It had 144 million euros in cash and equivalents at the end of December. In contrast, chief rival in the satnav sector Garmin Ltd had $2.3 billion, Google had $92 billion and Apple had $246 billion. Apple last year opened an office in Hyderabad, India to focus on mapping, creating as many as 4,000 jobs in the city. TomTom’s total headcount is 4,700, including 3,100 in R&D roles. TomTom is not alone in identifying traffic management as a growth opportunity. Panasonic Corp. has started testing its technology in Denver. Even as TomTom shifts away from selling the satellite navigation gear on which it has built its business, and moves toward data, software and services, it still generates half of its revenue from hardware.

(Image: REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/File Photo) A look at Chinese smartphone player Xiaomi's current portfolio in India reveals that about 90 percent of its sales are from online channels, while less than 10 percent is offline. This is set for a change this year as the company is now focusing on strengthening offline sales to penetrate deep into the hinterland. As of today, Xiaomi ships its products to around 14,000 pin codes -- close to 40 percent of the country's total -- every single week. "This clearly highlights our presence in the Tier 2 and Tier 3 markets. As we increase our focus on offline sales, we will further increase our penetration in these markets," Manu Jain, Vice President, Xiaomi, and Managing Director, Xiaomi India, told IANS. Xiaomi India reached three major milestones in 2016 -- it crossed $1 billion in annual revenue for the first time, secured a spot among the top three smartphone players in the country and, in October, sold a record 1.35 million smartphones.

"We are now present in more than 8,500 stores via our innovative offline distribution network. Last year was indeed a great year and we achieved several milestones while building our India story," Jain added. Redmi Note 3 was the first device Xiaomi launched in India last year. By year-end, it sold more than 3.6 million units and became the highest shipped device in the history of online India. "It was followed by equally appealing devices which disrupted the markets in their own domain. In 2017, we will continue to launch more innovative products and new categories," Jain told IANS. Xiaomi launched Redmi Note 4 earlier this year and sold more than 250,000 units in 10 minutes in the first sale across mi.com and Flipkart. "With Redmi Note 4, we are hoping to sell more than double the quantity of Redmi Note 3. We are also working towards strengthening our support pillars such as after-sales and customer-support, among other areas," Jain added. According to him, the Indian industry is on the cusp of witnessing some key smartphone trends that will dominate this year. "We will see faster chipsets that will be able to run seamless applications, while also allowing consumers to multi-task. Apart from fast processing, these chipsets will also provide optimal power consumption from a single charge," Jain told IANS.

"Xiaomi launched Mi Mix in China last year which is bezel-less concept smartphone that features a screen-to-body ratio of 91.3 percent," Jain noted. With an upsurge in usage, the smartphone makers will focus on bigger battery which can handle long hours of LTE usage, multi-tasking and high-graphic games and video content. "As more consumers perform their everyday tasks on mobile phones, people require more storage space for multimedia content, applications and so on. Even mid-range smartphones will focus on providing increased storage space this year," Jain emphasised. With smartphones becoming more powerful, manufacturers will also explore the world of virtual reality. "In the year 2017, we will see even affordable smartphones that will have VR functionality," Jain added. If we look at its global performance, Xiaomi -- once touted as the "Apple" of China -- has slipped to fourth spot back home as the demand for its smartphones has declined.

Epson L655 printer Review: An all in one printer that will not disappoint! By: Sandeep Budki, The Mobile Indian, New Delhi Last updated : Tuesday, March 07, 2017 - 14:16 The company had claimed that the printer can print A4 size monochrome prints at 12 paise/page and coloured prints at 20 paise/page PROS » Good quality photo prints » Wide range of connectivity options » Fast printing » Large ink tank capacity » CONS » Loud noise while printing » Quality of buttons could have been better Epson had launched its flagship All-in-one Duplex printer, L655, in India a few months back.   It comes with four functionalities -printer with copy, fax, printing and scanning capabilities. The company had claimed that the printer can print A4 size monochrome prints at 12 paise/page and coloured prints at 20 paise/page.   Along with duplex printing, which allows you to print on both sides of a page in a single command, it even has an  ADF (automatic document feeder), that scans documents automatically by placing them on document feeder.   Design   The overall design of Epson L655 is no way compact but it so many options to choose from one cannot complain about the bulky design. The top portion of the printer houses controls,  ADF and scanner bed while printing and paper cartridge unit are at the bottom. The ink tank is placed on the right side and ports are placed on the back panel.   If we talk about the control panel of Epson L655, It has a bunch of buttons which include navigation buttons for choosing different setting, colour print, black and white print, stops and redial along with a 2.2-inch monochrome LCD backlit display. The paper cartridge can hold the paper in the range of  A4 size sheets and 3.5×5-inch photo papers.  Different paper size adjustment clips are available inside the tray and the tray can also be detached from the printer.   The quality of material used in manufacturing printer is good but the quality of the scanner lid and button tray in control panel could have been better.  The lid is quite shaky and it hinges doesn’t seem to be strong enough and the button in the control panel are not smooth and bit noisy.   The printer has an Ethernet port along with wireless connectivity via WiFi. Apart from that the regular USB A male to B male type printer cable can also be used for connecting the printer to PC.   The refillable tanks which are located in a separate detachable unit on the side have four tanks - black, magenta, cyan and yellow. Refilling the tanks is not as easy as the traditional cartridge-based inkjet printers but over a period of time, one will get used to it. You need to be really careful not to spill the ink or end up mixing it with the ink in the nearby tank.   It took us around 20 minutes to complete the task. And after that, the printer takes more than 20 minutes to get ready for printing.       Setting up: Setting up the printer is fairly easy on both laptops and smartphone. The moment you connect Epson L655 to the computer using a cable it automatically detects the printer and starts installing the software. However, you will need the CD  which comes along with a printer to install full features. Having said that, for adjusting or modifying the settings key follow the instruction on the LCD panel using navigation keys and button as the screen is not touch-enabled.     On mobile, you can download the Epson iPrint application from play store or Apple store and then connect the L655 to it via WiFi and get going with printing.   Performance:   The printing quality of Epson L655 is impressive.  It has Dye colour and pigment black inks that dry quickly offering smudge-free prints and fulfils all the business and home needs. The text is sharp and colours reproduction is quite accurate in the printouts.   Interestingly, If you print pictures in glossy papers you will get a lab like output with precise detailing and vivid colour reproduction.  The printer gives a trouble-free performance except that it is a bit noisy and shaky during printing.   Printing a colour page at its highest quality setting takes just over one minute while duplex printing takes more than two minutes.  If you are planning to take a single page monochrome printout it will take around 30 seconds. On a single refill, one can print nearly 6000 monochrome documents and 6500 coloured documents and a new refill pack will cost around Rs 350.   Verdict Epson L655 all in one printer cost around Rs 23,500 and in our opinion it is a value for money proposition especially for small businesses who typically will take around 30-40 printouts per day. The quality of printout, in spite of affordable pricing, is top notch with emphasis on detailing and colour reproduction. The coloured photo-prints are as good as lab prints. The only thing that Epson can take care of in future models is to reduce the noise generated while printing.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 7 March 2017 by Military News Staz DeStout and Rude American Bats- A Great Small Business and Baseball Success Story     LAS VEGAS, NV, March 07, 2017 /24-7PressRelease/ — We’ve see hundreds of small businesses fail since coming out of the economic downturn several years ago, especially in the sporting goods arena…Remember Sports Authority anyone?? Now, there is a Phoenix rising from the ashes of baseball diamonds and practice fields across the US. Rude American USA and it’s captain Staz DeStout Last month, we took some time to out to for a Q & A session and to catch up with Rude American and CEO Staz DeStout, to see just what’s caused the recent frenzy over Rude American USA and their bat the MOAB (Mother of All Bats) Smart Media Marketing: So Staz, How is Business? We actually surpassed our 1st Quarter 2016 numbers in the 3rd week of January and it hasn’t stopped since. We could have never projected that and by early February we were nearly out of all stock. We have increased production to meet the demand and are now beginning to fulfill all of the back orders and have available current stock. Smart Media Marketing: To what do you owe this growth? Really a lot of things such as quality, performance, differentiating ourselves from the competition, grass roots marketing, the internet. Years ago you would have had to have had a much much larger advertising budget to get the word out, but today the internet has changed all that. We spent a lot of time researching the most effective ways to get our message out and worked diligently over the past year developing that strategy. We’re not going to give out our behind the scenes corporate secrets here but I can tell you it’s working and mainly because of our customers. Again there are many reasons for the growth but certainly customer videos are at the core. Our customers are testing our bats against all of the 800 pound gorillas in the bat industry and posting them on facebook. The customer facebook videos are viraling like crazy which is driving the traffic. Smart Media Marketing: What makes the MOAB different than the other 800 pound gorilla company bats? Staz: Everything, the bats look different, feel different, sound different; the ball comes off different. We were the first to produce a full graphic wrap around the bat. Our original decal company that produced for most of the major brands told us they had never seen anything like it in all the years they’ve been in the business. We’re the only bat on the market today with a „Ribbed Grip” giving the bat a sweet feel. At a trade show the booth next to us was Lizard Skins and they were passing our bat around saying „man feel this grip” and they’re the grip guys! They’ll not produce a ribbed grip because they are killing it with a flat grip with colors. Our bats also sound different and the ball definitely comes off different. Smart Media Marketing: Every company we have ever spoken to says their bat is better and that the ball comes off different. Why would you also say yours does too? Staz: First, we truly understand the performance standards better than the big companies and even have engineers that helped create those standards. Think about this, if you barge in thousands of bats you would have to live in a fear of exceeding the standard and having to eat all of those bats. We have no fear, we understand the performance standards better than the big companies, we are extremely aggressive, we do much smaller production runs right up to the edge of the standard and then we give the player a competitive advantage that exceeds it legally by having a Speed Engineered and a Power Engineered in every size model. The Speed is moderately balanced and the Power is moderately end loaded, key word is moderate. We do not make a heavily end loaded bat. Hitting is finite. An instructor may make a minor adjustment in a player’s swing that gets dramatic results and that’s what we’re doing with our weight distribution as long as players keep an open mind, it is definitely not lead off swing speed clean up swing power. There is no rhyme or reason, we have a 270 pound D1 player swinging speed and a 100 pound high school player soaking wet that does better with the power and vice versa. By doing a proper demo with one of our reps or dealers players are picking up a 3 to 5 MPH of increased ball exit speed; gaining a competitive edge over the competition. That’s the feedback we’re getting from players, coaches and instructors every day. Smart Media Marketing: How important is bat fitting? Staz: The player does become part of the secret sauce as we have lined up the right bat for his/her swing, many times for the first time in their career. That’s why there is not a better bat between our speed and power, there is a better bat for your particular swing and we don’t know which it will be. Smart Media Marketing: What if a customer goes on line, guesses and buys one or the other? Staz: You can guess and the players is going to get increased ball exit speed over their best bat but if you have a chance to demo it may reveal we just left a couple of MPH on the table. That’s why we love the demo process in the instance where it is possible. Smart Media Marketing: Is direct the only way you sell? Or are you having any success getting in any big box stores anytime soon? Staz: We are not concerning ourselves with that at this time and believe that will happen on its own in its due time. Our focus is more on local entrepreneurs around the country (and world for that matter) that are blazing the trail with us by investing in stocking our products in their existing Baseball Academy’s; Area rep’s that are taking our Inflatable batting cages direct to the tournaments and doing live demos. We have brick and mortar specialty sports stores too but the guys that create the buzz are definitely the guys doing demos. Those Academy Reps are golden with us and we have a strategy to allow those same entities to be the „Johnny Apple Seed” of Rude American. The plan compensates them as they play a role in our distribution growth and rightfully so as they are the ones with skin in the game that are helping to blaze the trail with us. It’s a real Win/Win for everybody involved. Ultimately, and we’re starting to see this now. Players are walking into stores asking for the MOAB, that’s typically when the stores come on board many of which are introduced by the local field reps. Smart Media Marketing: How has the company evolved over the last year? Staz: We’re bringing on key personnel in administration, engineering design and development. We brought on the founder of Post Net and we consider him to be an administrative, accounting, pick pack and ship monster. Our newest engineer, well really inventor, is a big part of not only our quality control today but our new product designs tomorrow and moving into the future. Smart Media Marketing: What is coming down the pipe and where do you see Rude American in 3 to 5 years? Still in the game? Bought by some big company? Staz: Had you asked me that this time last year I would have told you we hoped to capture a nice niche market of the big bat industry. Today our goals are much more lofty. We are spending our resources on bringing in people and minds that we believe are not only capable of managing our growth but are also capable of developing technology for bats and other related products that will absolutely change the industry. Smart Media Marketing: Congratulations on your success and we hope to be back in a few years to hear about you going public or at least your continued expansion and success. Keep up the great work!

Now these voters want jobs. CNN Money9:41 UP NEXT U.S. immigration authorities suspended a program last Friday that expedited visas for skilled workers — a darling class of workers in the tech community. Quotes in the article International Business Machines Corp IBM ▲ 180.47 +0.42 +0.23% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▼ 846.61 -3.27 -0.38% Microsoft Corp MSFT ▲ 64.27 +0.02 +0.03% Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 139.34 -0.44 -0.31% AdChoices Despite stoking tension in tech companies, it's a relatively routine decision that's happened under administrations past. But it is missing one key piece of information — a timeline— and that could impact businesses. What has changed? "Premium processing" of H-1B visas, which allowed skilled workers to pay extra to request faster approval to work in the U.S., will no longer be available starting April 3, immigration authorities announced. That basically means all applicants will have to wait the standard period to see if they have won the "lottery," without the option to pay an extra $1,225 filing fee for guaranteed answer after 15 days. Essentially, the government is shifting around which administrative tasks they'll tackle first, said said immigration attorney Rajiv Khanna. "This is not new for anybody. Last year they did the same thing," Khanna said. "It simply means a diversion of resources toward other programs that lack resources." Indeed, last year immigration authorities said they were delaying premium processing until May 16. But this year's announcement gives a six-month window, not a specific date, for the premium processing delay. © Provided by CNBC That's where things get tricky. "At least last year, we knew that by May, the premium track would kick in. It's fair for them to want a month, because they get this flood of applications and go through the lottery process. Getting a month is reasonable," said attorney Piyumi Samaratunga. "[Now] we don't know if it will be implemented in May or at all." For highly skilled foreign nationals hoping to work in the U.S., the H-1B visa program was already a gamble, as a relatively small number of spots are allocated through a lottery process. Almost all H-1B visa workers start working in October, and that won't change, Khanna said. H-1B visas applicants must apply six months in advance of their start date — meaning an April 1 application for an Oct.1 start date. Indeed, last year, the H-1B visa program hit its cap for petitions by April 7. What will change is how fast employers and workers get a "yay" or "nay" on whether they were one of the lucky ones. Why is this changing? The change quickly prompted reports that the Trump administration is "dismantling the H-1B visa" and will "leave many people and companies in limbo." But the H-1B announcement (not to be conflated with an updated travel ban signed Monday) is closer to a supply chain issue, Samaratunga said. U.S. immigration authorities said temporary suspension will free them up to sift through a backlog of long-pending applications. That means the majority of visa applicants won't face the long wait times they have in years past. "The stated intent of the temporary suspension is to clear the backlog, which is an important step for those companies that have been waiting for months," Manan Mehta, founding partner of Unshackled Ventures, a venture capital firm that helps immigrant-founded start-ups deal with immigration issues. So while it's entirely possible that president Donald Trump will upend the skilled immigration program, this announcement is more of a hiring headache than anything. Still, immigration lawyer Greg Siskind suggested in a blog post that the change might be a "slow walk" to make H-1B visas a less attractive option, especially in the medical field.  Yes, USCIS has suspended H-1B PPS in the past, but only for a few weeks and only for a few kinds of cases. This is a much different thing. 2— (((Greg Siskind))) (@gsiskind) March 5, 2017 Who is affected? Employers are first and foremost, going to have the toughest time adapting, Samaratunga said. Let's say an employer extends a job offer, alongside an H-1B visa sponsorship, to a worker, ahead of the April 1 rush. With the fast track option, they could know very soon if their petition was likely to be accepted, and could start planning the onboarding accordingly. If it was likely to be denied, they could begin looking for a new candidate. But now, they'll have to wait in line, like everyone else. The average wait time is three to six months, Mehta said. So, the employer might not know until September whether their employee will be authorized to work. The suspension could especially be a sticking point for tech companies that are hoping to get to the cutting edge faster than their competitors. The technology community is in the midst of a talent war, poaching each other's workers and setting up relationships with universities to snare top engineers. Companies like IBM, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Apple have been among the top recipients of H-1B visas in past years, New York Times data analysis shows, aside from a massive swath of visas issued to consulting firms that are known to outsource. Alphabet chairman Eric Schmidt said last year that H-1B visa reform was a top policy priority for tech, noting that Google has brilliant engineers who are languishing in condos in Canada waiting to get to work. The new delay does mean a little more uncertainty for some workers. Particularly, workers who are on the verge of losing their current visas, and were hoping to have a quick insight into whether they should sign a new lease or pack their bags. Also affected are H-1B visa applicants that are not subject to the usual cap — especially those working at universities, Khanna said. And a small group of foreign nationals may have to take a break from working while they wait for a visa change to take hold, said Mehta. Then there are practical inconveniences, like getting one's driver's license renewed or traveling while immigration status is pending, Siskend wrote. Given all the uncertainty, Samaratunga said, some employers might be more reticint to hire foreign workers — although if they had another choice, hiring a domestic worker is almost always the more practical choice either way, she said. But there are plenty of loopholes to push through the most urgent cases, Khanna said. Severe financial loss to a company, emergencies, non-profit and humanitarian causes can all still merit requests expedited H-1B visas, Khanna said. And students or H-1B workers changing jobs have special protections to cover the gap while they wait for their new visa to kick in. Mehta suggested that workers hoping to change their visa status to another type apply to do so by the end of the month to avoid being affected by the suspension.

James Abbott looks at five options TAGS: Homepage   Modern cameras are excellent performers when it comes to high ISO sensitivities, and it’s common to be able to shoot as high as ISO 1600 without noise being a problem. These days, ISO1600 is roughly equivalent to ISO 400, in terms of noise, in cameras from ten years ago, so for most images you can often get away with not needing to use noise reduction. However, there are times when the ISO you need is so high that noise is inevitable. The most common reason for needing high ISO settings is to enable you get usable shots in low light by keeping the shutter speed fast enough to avoid camera shake. You also need high ISOs when shooting sports – where the shutter speed needs not to only support the focal length of the lens and avoid camera shake, but also to freeze the action. In these cases it can be common to shoot as high as ISO 25,600, and it’s at these settings where noise-reduction software can drastically reduce the amount of noise in your shots. The two main types of noise are colour/ chroma and luminance. Colour noise appears as coloured specks and patches, while luminance noise has a grain-like appearance similar to film grain, although more uniform in size and shape. Noise-reduction software is the best way to combat these negative side effects, and there are a number of options out there ranging from free software, noise-reduction features within editing software such as Photoshop to dedicated programs whose sole function is to reduce high ISO noise. We compared how five of your best options performed on the above shot to find out what works and what doesn’t. Lightroom/ACR Price: Creative Cloud Photography Plan £102 per year Website: www.adobe.com/uk Adobe Camera Raw (ACR) is the part of Photoshop used for processing raw files. The same image-processing engine is used in Lightroom, so the two offer identical features. The Noise Reduction controls sit within the Detail tab, and applying noise reduction is manual with no presets or intelligent auto settings on offer. By default, Color is set to 25, which is often more than adequate for even the highest ISO settings. For most images the Color slider is the only one you need to use to reduce colour noise, but the Detail and Smoothness sliders offer additional control. Luminance, which sits above Color, has the main slider set to 0 by default, and needs to be applied sparingly to avoid ‘waxy-looking’ detail. The Detail and Contrast sliders allow you to refine the appearance of the luminance noise reduction. The overall quality of noise reduction using Lightroom and ACR is excellent, and for most photographers shooting raw it’s the ideal choice. Lightroom did a great job of reducing both types of noise in our test images covering ISO 1600, 6400 and 25,600. Even at the highest ISO setting it was possible to drastically reduce noise without losing too much detail or creating waxy tones. For those shooting JPEGs, the Camera Raw Filter in Photoshop gives you access to ACR controls including noise reduction. SCORE: 4.5 out of 5 Google Nik Collection Dfine 2 Price: Free Website: www.google.com/nikcollection Dfine 2 comes with six plug-ins that work seamlessly with Photoshop, Lightroom and the now-defunct Aperture, so you will need one or more of these programs to use Dfine 2. The best way to use the software is to convert raw files to 16-bit TIFFs in Photoshop or Lightroom, and then open them in Dfine. The software interface is clear and simple, and when the image initially opens it’s analysed with Method set to Automatic. You can use this or select Manual to choose several points manually within the image, but Automatic saves time. At this point you click on the Reduce tab and have two options: Points and Colour Ranges. Points provides an easy way of reducing noise and the ability to place localised control points. The Colour Ranges option breaks the image down into three channels and offers the ability to control contrast noise (luminance) and colour noise independently. The main problem is that you’re working on a TIFF rather than a raw file, and you will nearly always achieve better results using raw. Results were impressive, though, and the plug-in suite is worth looking into if only for HDR Efex Pro and Silver Efex Pro. SCORE: 3.5 out of 5 DxO OpticsPro 11 Elite Price: £159 Website: www.dxo.com DxO OpticsPro 11 Elite offers all the controls you’d expect in a raw converter, plus unrivalled lens correction and highly regarded noise-reduction capabilities. This software does most of what you need and offers seamless integration with Lightroom. Make all your adjustments in Lightroom, export a DNG to OpticsPro for lens correction, sharpening and noise reduction, and then back into Lightroom. OpticsPro uses DxO PRIME technology to analyse raw files to differentiate between noise and fine details. Using just the intelligent automatic noise-reduction feature produced the best results in our test, but there are four simple sliders that can also be used. First, choose between the HQ (Fast) and PRIME algorithms, with the former being faster and the latter providing slower processing time but improved noise reduction. With a high ISO shot PRIME is the logical choice. If you prefer to use manual, you can use the sliders to reduce luminance and colour noise, plus coarse noise and colour blotches. There’s also a slider to reduce dead and hot pixels. The noise reduction achievable by OpticsPro 11 Elite is the best in class. The main downside is that if you use Lightroom it requires an extra purchase. However, the licence is a one-off fee, and OpticsPro works standalone or will integrate into Lightroom’s workflow. SCORE: 5 out of 5 MacPhun Luminar Price: £44 Website: www.macphun.com/luminar MacPhun Luminar is an image-editing program for all levels of photographer. In a photography world dominated by Adobe products, MacPhun is making waves with its primarily Mac-based software. At present Luminar is only available for Apple computers, but future software is expected for PCs. Luminar works as standalone software and as a plug-in for Photoshop, and supports various image file types including raw. One of its innovative features is that you can adapt the interface to suit your needs and ability, by turning the visibility of tools and features off or on. Noise reduction is accessed via the main menu rather than a tool bar, but is easy to find. The software is a pleasure to use thanks to its simplicity and powerful controls. The noise-reduction controls were the easiest to use in the test by far, and despite their simplicity the results were very good. The results were in the same league as Lightroom, which makes this software a very attractive proposition for the price for Mac users. At the time of writing Luminar is available for £44 (RRP £52). Like DxO OpticsPro 11 Elite, Luminar is a great piece of software with unique features, but neither includes the image-cataloguing capabilities of Lightroom. Topaz DeNoise Price: $79.99 Website: www.topazlabs.com/denoise Topaz DeNoise is designed just to reduce noise, although Topaz does produce a range of photography software solutions. Just like Dfine 2, DeNoise integrates with both Photoshop and Lightroom, but also covers Corel PaintShop Pro and Photo Plus (although Photo Plus is no longer supported by Serif, despite being available to purchase). DeNoise uses image data to remove noise and recover detail, with controls to handle colour and luminosity noise alongside problems such debanding, shadow- tone restoration and colour casts. DeNoise offers the most controls of all the software in this test, and will appeal to those who like to fine-tune noise reduction. However, the process is more time-consuming than the other options despite being able to use existing presets and those you create yourself. These include presets for a limited number of cameras at specific ISO settings, plus a selection for JPEG and raw. The software works with JPEGs or TIFFS, and for best results you should convert raw files to 16-bit TIFFs. DeNoise did a good job of our ISO1600 and 6400 test images, but at ISO 25,600 it started to fall behind the others. While the image looked good at fit to screen, when zoomed in to 100% there was strong luminance noise visible, especially in the shadows. At $79 Topaz DeNoise isn’t expensive, but Nik Dfine is free and offers better results. SCORE: 3 out of 5 Our verdict Noise-reduction software remains an important consideration for photographers, despite the incredible capabilities of modern cameras. The main considerations are whether or not you want to add another step to your workflow, change processing software or is it important for you to work with raw files rather than 16-bit TIFFs? The answer will be different for everyone, but there are certainly some interesting options on the table. Topaz DeNoise offers a lot of control over each element of noise reduction, all within software that works standalone or integrates with several other editing programs, most notable perhaps being PaintShop Pro, which isn’t often supported by plug-ins. Unfortunately, the overall process using DeNoise was slower than the other software, and the results not as good with higher ISO images. Considering Google Nik Dfine 2 works with 16-bit TIFFs (or JPEGs), the plug-in did a very good job of reducing noise in our test images. It wasn’t too far behind Adobe Camera Raw, although this point alone makes its use questionable because of the extra step it would introduce into your Adobe-based workflow. That said, it is free and sits within a suite of highly regarded plug-ins. Adobe may have a monopoly on editing software, but that hasn’t put MacPhun off from producing some excellent image-editing software packages including Luminar. The software is simple and intuitive to use, and the noise-reduction element was the easiest of all the software in the test. While the test images could have been pushed harder with higher settings without creating a waxy look, the overall results were similar to Adobe Camera Raw. Unfortunately, Luminar is currently only compatible with Apple computers. Lightroom is the king of image cataloguing, and alongside powerful controls it’s a strong option for photographers. Noise reduction is impressive, and if you want to keep your workflow simple with fast and easy-to-use noise reduction controls, then look no further. If you really want the best noise reduction you can buy, whether you’re looking for full automation or manual control, then DxO OpticsPro 11 Elite is the option for you. This powerful raw-processing software produces excellent results, and works standalone or integrates with Lightroom for the most powerful combination of all. To achieve the finest results you’ll want to select the PRIME algorithm ahead of the HQ (fast) option, however you’ll need to be prepared for this to eat into your workflow. It slows down the speed of turning around large batches of images considerably. It might not have the image cataloguing of Lightroom, but if you’re after ultimate noise reduction control, DxO Optics Pro gets the nod.

It is expected to merge many of its India operations and serve as a base for further expansion." Assembly Elections 2017: Is Modi on a road to nowhere in Uttar Pradesh? BENGALURU: Microsoft is close to signing a nine-year lease deal with Prestige Group for a 600,000 sq ft office space in Bengaluru, three people aware of the development said. "The deal is in the final stage of closure," they said, adding that the lease is renewable every three years. The Redmond-based technology company , which currently operates out of Embassy Golf Link in the city , is looking for more office space as part of chief executive Satya Nadella's plan to tap the local market and its engineering talent. A spokesperson for Microsoft did not confirm the talks but said: "We have a large employee base in Bengaluru and they work out of different offices in the city. We regularly undertake a strategic assessment of our real estate portfolio in Bengaluru to ensure that we have the right long-term plan in place to support our business growth. We will share more details as we finalise our plans." One of the persons quoted earlier said: "The company is looking to move its employees by the first half of this year. It is expected to merge many of its India operations and serve as a base for further expansion." The new campus will seat 6,000 employees, he said. Earlier, Microsoft was scouting for 1.1 million sq ft of space in Bengaluru for a built-to-suit campus. The company, which has offices in 10 locations across India, had planned to invest $1 billion in the campus over five years. In anticipation of a growth in business, many companies have committed to acquiring office space in Bengaluru, the country's technology hub, reducing the pool of available space in the city. Recently, Apple leased over 40,000 sq ft of office space in the city where it intends to set up a development centre, three people familiar with the matter said. In 2015, US-based Google had taken 100,000 sq ft of office space on lease in Bengaluru's Bagmane World Technology Centre. It is also setting up a 7acre campus in Hyderabad, which will be its biggest outside the US. Last year, India's office market segment saw deals for over 43 million sq ft of space, touching an all-time high with a 9 per cent year-on-year growth, said a CBRE India report. Bengaluru and the National Capital Region dominate leasing on an annual basis with 47 per cent share. ITITeS firms continue to lead office transaction activity, accounting for about 50% of the transaction activity during the last quarter. However, corporate occupiers are likely to remain cost-sensitive, consider adoption of workplace strategies for efficient space-utilisation.

At the Cisco Live 2017 event in Melbourne, Optus Business said the partnership enables the company to further optimise its cloud, collaboration and infrastructure technologies. The announcement builds on the commitment of Optus Business and Cisco’s three-year co-investment of $12 million to develop local capabilities. Key initiatives of this co-investment that was announced last year, include cloud orchestration, collaboration, and cyber security. Optus Business managing director, John Paitaridis, said both companies have a shared vision in creating the workplace of the future and improving customer experience as disruption is a common theme in the marketplace. “There is disruption in terms of the way that technology has become an opportunity and a challenge for organisations that are now mastering their capabilities. That has completely transformed the way that work is conducted in this country and the way we live our lives. “So, together with Cisco, we had to find ways to assist these organisations in their customer engagement strategy, workforce productivity, efficiencies, and speed to market,” he mentioned. In line with this, the companies have launched integrated architectures and services. As part of the collaboration, the latest release of the Optus Business Contact Centre platform, optimised with Cisco, is expected to reduce the total cost of ownership, while allowing businesses to boost customer interactions. The solution now includes Interactive Voice Response for call steering, self-service and precision routing, in addition to integrating digital-enabled channels, including web chat, social media engagement and email. Read more Optus Business launches new cloud platform with Pure Storage Paitaridis said the solution is aimed at scaling into enterprise and mid-market organisations. Ken Boal (Cisco) and John Paitaridis (Optus Business) Another new integration is with Cisco Meraki. The new capability allows customers to concentrate and reallocate resources, with Optus Business managing the initial deployment, as well as ongoing assurance, change and configuration. The expansion of the Optus Business and Cisco relationship will also see the development of Optus Video-Conferencing-as-a-Service (VCaaS) in the near future, to provide customers with a hosted video conferencing bridge service. The VCaaS platform will extend UCaaS to allow customers to perform multi-party video conferences both within their organisation and externally with other organisations using meeting room video units.

Integrated with Optus’ mobile, data and voice networks, and leveraging the Cisco-Apple collaboration, Optus Business aims to provide customers with a “heightened collaboration experience”. Cisco Systems A/NZ vice-president, Ken Boal, said both companies believe a smart network is “fundamental” to the business transformation journey. “That’s been our focus for the past 12 to 18 months, because there has been a lot of modernisation happening around those network platforms, and that’s a big part of the evolution of partnerships.

We’ve been working very comprehensively with Optus Business on this,” he said. According to Boal, it’s all about improving the workplace experience and delivering on the promise to support each customer’s transition to the workplace of the future. “Whether its applications, security, cloud, collaboration or networks, customers want partners who understand this spectrum of managed technology and services. “Customers aren’t enjoying productivity as much as they should, so Optus Business and Cisco have embarked on this opportunity to take the latest technology capabilities and deliver that through as a service into the marketplace,” he mentioned.

Many MSPs are seen to be stuck in the same comfort cycle of doing business within the few markets that they are comfortable in, but delivering stellar growth goes beyond doing just that; they need to take risks and branch out, or risk being gone. This exclusive ARN roundtable, in association with SolarWinds MSP, addressed key trends in the market for MSPs, diversifying areas of play – from SMB through to mid-market and enterprise, lucrative verticals, the importance of strategic alliances, as well as expanding into niche areas such as cybersecurity and ransomware and using them as a hook for customer conversations.

Any remaining hopes of a surprise appearance at last week’s Mobile World Congress in Barcelona were crushed when Samsung announced the event titled “Galaxy Unpacked” prior to the MWC’s official launch last Sunday. Following the fiasco surrounding the Galaxy Note 7’s faulty batteries, Samsung has a lot riding on the Galaxy S8. In order to gain back consumer trust, the company needs the launch of its next flagship device to go flawless, which is probably the reason behind the delay. Making up for the Galaxy Note debacle isn’t the only reason why the Galaxy S8 better be a hit: as our chart illustrates, Samsung has fallen behind Apple in terms of mobile device sales recently. The company may still lead the smartphone market in terms of unit sales, but in terms of revenue, the iPhone alone beats Samsung’s entire mobile communications unit by more than 70 percent.

Weather Your 4-day local weather forecast Tuesday March 7, 2017 News Local News Larger / SmallerNight Mode STOP PRESS: A frustrating comedy of errors when it comes to NBN DENIS GREGORY 7 Mar 2017, 4:39 p.m. "There's unbelievable goings-on that would make a comedy movie if they weren't so serious" TOO-HARD BASKET: The broken NBN line brought down by a truck a month ago and taped to a pole in Clinton Street. Photo: CONTRIBUTED The chickens should come home to roost for Telstra because of its penny-pinching technical staff cuts and employment of off-shore people to deal with complaints and faults. There's dozens of people in Orange cranky about the poor NBN service but there's other unbelievable goings-on that would make a comedy movie if they weren't so serious. In one, a truck on February 11 clipped and brought down a low NBN line strung across Clinton Street, leaving a resident without any service and totally frustrated because of Telstra's and NBN's inaction to fix it after four hour-long sessions off-shore via a friend's phone over four different days. Well and truly fired up, the resident also complained to Orange MPs Phil Donato and Andrew Gee, the communications minister, the Opposition communication spokesperson, the communications Ombudsman and everyone else he could think of. He was eventually promised a technician would be there on Tuesday, February 21 between 1pm and 5pm, but he failed to turn up. After another call via the friend's phone he was told a technician would come again on Friday, February 24 between 8am and 12pm. He turned up at 12.30pm, looked at the broken line, which a resident had rolled up and taped to a pole across the road, and decided there was nothing he could do because he wasn't allowed to climb a ladder higher than three metres. Instead, he took photos of the broken line to send to superiors at Dubbo, but he didn't expect anything would be done until Essential Energy – the government authority that looks after our electricity network – had a spare cherry picker that a technician could use to get up and do the job. That could take weeks because there had to be enough jobs in a day to warrant an Orange visit. Can you believe things like this can happen? Would people in Point Piper or Darling Point accept it? No, but we're in the bush. The government needs to put a rocket under Telstra and NBN. And bring back the 25 or so local technicians that have been sacked. DOMINO’S CAN’T BE SIRI-OUS       IT’S interesting Domino's pizza is using voice-based technology like Apple's Siri for customers to order online. Well, that's the intention, but wish Domino’s luck because if you've tried to have a sensible conversation with Apple's voice-activated Siri on your iPhone you'll know it's a pretty difficult job talking to a robot. Siri, who has a part-human, part-robot voice, no doubt gets confused by some simple phrases like this one Stop Press used: “I'd like to order a lamb tzatziki pizza, please”. There's a brief silence while Siri ponders the request. “Sorry, I didn't quite get that ...” “I'd like to order a lamb tzatziki pizza.” Another long silence. “Sorry, I'm not sure what you said.” “I want to know whether you can understand me?” Another brief silence and then Siri replies: “OK, you want the weather.” Good luck, Domino’s. You'll need it. SIR JACK’S MINTED MEMORIAL THE Australian Mint has produced a coloured limited edition 50-cent coin featuring three-time world F1 champion Sir Jack Brabham.

Africa obsessions our picks latest popular like us on facebook follow us on twitter about us Atlas quartz index quartz app quartz quartz India quartz Africa Change your edition back to menu HIDDEN CHAMPIONS Economic downturn is slowing the growth and visibility of Africa’s top brands Written by Abdi Latif Dahir 2 hours ago Quartz africa MTN: The most valuable and admired African brand. (AP Photo/Sunday Alamba) Share Written by Abdi Latif Dahir 2 hours ago Quartz africa In 2016, low commodity and oil prices subdued the growth of African economies to their lowest levels in over two decades. The sluggish growth also damaged the place and value of African brands. Last year, the share of African brands among the most admired and valued companies fell from 23% in 2015 to 16% among international brands in 2016, according to Brand Africa 100, the non-profit which values and ranks the continent’s best brands. The list was culled from over 11,000 brand mentions cited through a mobile survey by consumers in 19 African countries, who collectively represent 74% of the continent’s population. The grading was then done through a blend of a brand’s financial performance and consumer admiration. Position Brand 1 MTN 2 Glo/Globacom 3 Dangote Group 4 Anbessa Shoes 5 Safaricom/MPESA 6 Tusker 7 Mukwano Products 8 DStv/Gotv/Multichoice 9 Shoprite 10 Tiger Brands African brands represented 0.75% of the value of the top 100 most admired brands, and non-African brands clinched the list of top three brands in all African markets. The only exceptions were in Nigeria, where telecommunications company Glo featured at number 3; Kenya, where Safaricom came at number 2, and alcoholic beverage Tusker ranked at number 3; and the Azam Group at number 2 in Tanzania. At 25 brands, companies originating from the United States were in the lead among the top 100 companies valued by Africans, followed by European nations like the United Kingdom (8), Germany (6), and France (5), besides Asian products from Japan (6) and China (5). MTN, the most admired and valuable African brand, has faced significant legal and leadership challenges. It dropped from the top spot to the ninth position on the continent’s most esteemed brands. It was preceded by Samsung, Nike, Adidas, Coca-Cola, Apple, LG, Nokia, and Toyota. French clothing company Lacoste was the most resurgent brand among the respondents, jumping to position 42 in 2016 from 92 in 2015. And perhaps, in a sign of rising middle-class consumerism, new global entrants in luxury apparel such as Louis Vuitton, Calvin Klein, and Prada appeared in the ranking. Chinese media company StarTimes, a competitor to South Africa-owned Multichoice, was featured for the first time, while Facebook rose eight positions to rank at number 63 continentally. Swedish cosmetics firm Oriflame and German car manufacturer Audi also appeared in the list for the first time. But the lower profile of African brands doesn’t mean all is gloomy for the continent’s companies. The continent is ripe with business opportunities, and Africa-owned brands are growing faster and making more money than their global peers. Diversification is also apparent in both the most valuable and admired African companies, with investment in telecommunication, food, beverages, media, apparels, and retail industries. Brand Africa also noted that 31 new brands, including Ethiopia’s Anbessa Shoes and Morocco’s fashion label Marwa, joined the top 100 list in 2016. Media outlets such as DSTV and financial service providers such as Safaricom’s MPESA also featured among the top 100 brands in the continent.

Can pop-up 'repair cafes' save broken gadgets and solve growing waste levels? Print Share this story Can pop-up 'repair cafes' save broken gadgets and solve growing waste levels? Updated 7 March 2017, 19:10 AEDT By Margot O'Neill Tinkering, patching and mending is making a comeback as a new breed of repair experts help people maintain household items for free rather than throw them out. Hard at work in Sydney's fixer cafe. (Credit: ABC)  Broken clocks, vacuum cleaners, clothes and furniture are just some of the items that can be repaired at one of a string of pop-up "repair cafes" now open around Australia. One of the first to open, The Bower in Marrickville, Sydney, said its volunteer fixers had helped to repair items for more than 800 people and "diverted 97 tonnes of waste from landfill", equivalent to "two and a half Olympic swimming pools". "We encourage people to reuse things where possible, to repair things where possible, or to donate them to us where we can fix them up and sell them at really low cost," said The Bower's Annette Mayne. Fixing it all The Bower has experts in electronics, carpentry and bicycle repairs. But you cannot just dump your broken product and go for coffee; part of the deal is that you stay and learn how to fix it yourself. "It would be fantastic if we could bring a change in attitude and behaviour in people, to actually turn away from being a throwaway society," Ms Mayne said. "We're engaging with people to show them how repair happens, how simple it can be to use tools and to give them some skills, so that for example, if the leg of a chair breaks again, they can fix it themselves." It can be easier said than done at a time when many consumer products are so cheap it is seemingly quicker and more efficient to just buy a new one. There is also the difficulty of trying to find a specialised fixer, and the problem that many electronic products can only be fixed using a company's proprietary parts and services. At the same time, waste in Australia is surging by 170 per cent each year — on average, two tonnes per person. 'If you can't fix it, do you really own it?' US repair advocate Kyle Wiens, who founded the online repair community iFixit, said he believed many companies herded customers towards new purchases and actively blocked their ability to maintain older products. "The helplessness that we all feel when something breaks and we can't fix it, isn't necessarily our fault," he said. "It's a result of manufacturers systematically working to make these things obsolescent, and working to force people into having to buy a new one when they break. "We're seeing companies like Toshiba threatening to sue people for sharing repair manuals. If you buy an iPad, there is no way to get a replacement battery from Apple. "So we have very few consumer rights when it comes to being able to fix things right now." Mr Wiens is pushing for "Right to Repair" legislation in seven states in the US with the catchphrase, "If you can't fix it, you don't really own it". His group also publishes thousands of videos and online repair manuals to teach people the basic steps needed to, for example, open up an iPhone. "We think everybody ought to know how to fix their stuff, and since the manufacturers won't share manuals we decided to write them ourselves," he said. Apple has argued that new laws forcing them to sell spare parts to DIY fixers and independent repairers would be dangerous because of the sophisticated circuitry, the volatility of batteries and the likelihood their products would become more hackable. "We've helped over a million people fix iPhones themselves, without prior professional experience. The key is knowing how to do it safely," said Mr Wiens. "So if you have information, if you have photos that show you step-by-step, then you can dive in, you can look at the pictures before you take it apart."

It’s that after so long, after much pleading and wishing, the Type R is finally not dangling just out of our reach, to be savored only in video games and daydreams. With the debut of the 2017 Type R in Geneva, Honda is officially back as a performance brand in the U.S. Let the confetti fly. With all that being said, there isn’t much in the way of surprises with this Type R. It’s more that all of the components of the most recent European Civic Type R have been polished and incorporated into a more fully realized package. The 306 hp and 295 lb-ft of torque from its 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine (with VTEC, obviously) is the same exact output as in the outgoing Type R, although the engine is now built at Honda’s engine plant in Ohio. You better know how to row your own, too, as Honda is brilliantly offering only a six-speed manual transmission, albeit with the addition of rev-matching technology. Honda says a new single-mass flywheel cuts clutch inertia by 25 percent and that we’ll be treated to improved acceleration response courtesy of a lower final gear ratio. The story is similar with the suspension, which builds upon what we saw in the outgoing Type R. Here too we see the last car’s Dual-Axis front suspension setup, with aluminum lower arms and steering knuckles, which aim to banish torque steer by letting each wheel steer closer to its centerline. Up front is a familiar helical limited-slip differential. As with the last Type R, the front brakes are burly 13.8-inch vented and cross-drilled four-piston Brembos (the rears use solid 12-inch rotors). But in addition to the expectedly aggressive and revised tuning for the electronic power steering, springs, dampers, and bushings, Honda also upgraded the dampers. Replacing the magnetorheological dampers of old are new adaptive three-chamber units for each of the wheels. Speaking of, those wheels are now 20 inches instead of 19, wearing Continental ContiSportContact 6 tires. When we drove the old European Type R both on the road and on the track, our main complaint was that the steering didn’t have much life or vibrancy to it. Honda hopes that will change with improved steering response and stability made possible by a 38 percent increase in torsional rigidity. Weight is down 35 pounds compared to the last generation, down to 3,012 pounds (15 lighter than the standard 2017 Civic Hatchback). Very interesting, as well, is how Honda will position the Civic Type R in the U.S. When it hits the market in late spring this year, it will be priced in the mid-$30,000 range, likely just underneath rivals like the VW Golf R, Ford Focus RS, and Subaru WRX STI. However Honda isn’t one for options, and while the other usual suspects can easily be loaded up north of $40,000, the Type R will come fully equipped in Touring trim and offer nothing extra. Included are the Type R’s racy, red-trimmed front seats with lots of bolstering, a 7-inch touchscreen with nav and Apple/Android smartphone mirroring, and a 12-speaker audio system with satellite radio and Pandora capability. As before, the Type R’s interior is full of carbon-fiber detailing, a slick aluminum shift knob, and a sportier, more menacing instrument cluster design. Soon we’ll be seeing the 2017 Honda Civic Type R on our shores, which is a pleasure of which we’ve long been deprived. Not only has the current 10th-gen Civic shown to be among the best in its class, but with the upcoming Si and now the Type R, it should be on just about every small-car shopping list. That it’ll be cheaper than its competition and offer a different, front-wheel drive experience will give enthusiasts in this space even more choice and variety than before.

Have our politicians simply been lazy or slow to react?  Perhaps unsurprisingly it’s a little more complex than that, although previous attempts to legislate for the impact of the digital economy have certainly proved troublesome.  A substantial number of the provisions in the 2010 Digital Economy Act were never implemented whilst others were repealed.  A contemporary namesake for this bill is currently working its way through Parliament.  But it is also the case that, thanks to the role that judge-made law plays in our system of government, the British legal system has so-far proven to be remarkably adaptable to the digital era.  Whilst there is course both European and UK-specific legislation which explicitly recognises the existence of computers, a significant number of the policy and legal challenges associated with the online world have been addressed through legal findings that existing statute applies online.  Issues such as freedom of speech, pornography, hate, terrorism and copyright (amongst others) have often been dealt with in the online world using legislation framed before the Internet was mainstream. So it’s interesting to ponder, as the pace of digital disruption increases, if we have the right public policy response to the digital economy.  Last October a landmark Employment Tribunal brought by the GMB union concluded that drivers engaged via taxi-app service Uber are “workers” and hence entitled to the minimum wage and holiday pay.  Whilst the firm is appealing the judgement, the fact that even the organisational “innovation” associated with the so-called sharing economy has proven itself to be subject to our Common Law tradition raises the question of whether this might not prove to be a storm in a teacup. So what, if anything, is different about this round of technology-driven change? Though the impact of the networked computer on modern life and business has been profound and seemingly rapid, in practice we had a decade or two to get used to each of the previous generations of Information Technology, from the mainframe through minicomputers, to the PC and the first phase of the World-Wide Web.  As the new business models they enabled took hold, most industries had ample time to adapt.  To reskill their workforce or retire and replace through attrition.  But more recent innovations have arrived as relentless, overlapping waves; cloud computing, smart phones, social networks, big data, the Internet of Things, autonomous vehicles, artificial intelligence and the next generation of robotics.  As usual, those in blue collar jobs have been the first to experience the consequences of these latest changes. But the wide-spread availability of digital technology through asset-free, “as a service” models underpinned by open standards means that they are accessible to any business, whether existing or start-up, with the skills to embrace and integrate them into their operations. And they now threaten the livelihoods of those whose white collar jobs can be successfully rendered into code.  Because these technologies allow new companies to be created and to grow without many of the traditional barriers, such as access to capital or the physical challenges traditionally associated with operating across geographic boundaries, the leaders in these fields become very big very quickly and often dominate the industries in which they operate.  The emergence of this phenomenon was noticed more than five years ago by Silicon Valley legend Marc Andreessen, an influential Venture Capitalist who founded Netscape, the company which first commercialised the Web Browser.  In a seminal 2011 Wall Street Journal article he claimed that “software is eating the world” and observed that in most sectors of the global economy, the fastest growing businesses were in effect software companies; Amazon in retail, Apple in music distribution, Facebook and Google in advertising, LinkedIn in recruitment, Netflix in video rental and so on.  Whilst consumers of Internet services are undoubtedly benefitting from them, there are many citizens who find themselves negatively impacted as industries they work in or rely on are disrupted, as traditional labour models are replaced with more self-employment, or who are simply being left behind because they lack the skills or abilities to get online.  So notwithstanding the ability of the UK’s legal corpus to heal itself, it’s the pace and scale of the impact of these disruptive influences which raises the most significant questions for policymakers.  We need to decide as a nation how to respond to the societal changes that the digital economy will drive and to create a new generation of public policy which supports this innovation whilst appropriately sharing the benefits and protecting those impacted.  It feels like an inadequate response to wait until legal challenges are brought against established companies before we form a point of view on some of these matters. Instead, I suggest our parliamentarians should give this more explicit consideration.  To actively consider when (and indeed if) to regulate, or whether to slacken regulation of traditional industries that are being disrupted by digital companies but are currently unable to respond.  To decide how they might embrace the productivity benefits of automation and the next generation of robotics whilst preserving employment opportunities for those whose jobs are threatened by them.  And how to adapt government functions such as taxation, welfare, education and our employment laws to better support those for whom the world of work will be immeasurably different to their parents.  Last month Hewlett Packard Enterprise and the New Statesman convened a discussion on this topic with parliamentarians from each of the three main political parties and other experts.  This article forms an introduction to a series on the topic of columns from three of the MPs who took part.  It will be fascinating to compare how each of them responds to the challenges of governing the digital economy. › Will François Fillon quit - or bring his party down with him?

You’ll never get anyone with teeth like that, said C, and packed me off to the dentist. Sign up to the Staggers Morning Call email * By Nicholas Lezard Follow @@nicklezard         Print HTML To Chelsea Harbour, and a dentist. This is something of an adventure for me. The dentist part involves a free consultation, arranged for me by C——, who, you may remember from a couple of weeks ago, gave me that nice kiss. She has given me to understand that anything more exciting than that will not happen to me, at either her hands or anyone else’s, if I do not get my gnashers sorted out. She has a point: years of smoking and drinking red wine have taken their toll, and sometimes, when the lighting is in the wrong place, it looks as though my two front teeth have been knocked out when I smile. They’re still there, just a little . . . eroded. This being a private dentist, I entertain no illusions about ever being able to pay for such treatment as I will need, apart from an idle fantasy that not only will the dentist be a beautiful woman, she will also decide that I am so wonderful that she will perform her services upon me for free. This falls at the very far end of the range of possibilities, way beyond “unlikely”, and indeed nudging the borders of “impossible”. Still, I need something to motivate me to get out of the Hovel. And getting out of the Hovel and into Chelsea Harbour is a drag. For one thing, I haven’t been to Chelsea Harbour – to actually walk around it, as opposed to clocking it while driving over Battersea Bridge – for about . . . God, it must be getting on for thirty years. I was with Deirdre Redgrave, the ex-wife of Corin, mother of Jemma, sometime lover of Jeffrey Bernard and, in her own right, one of the most beautiful women I have ever known. “Let’s go and see my friend Lemmy,” she said. “He’s on a barge in Chelsea Harbour.” I was terribly excited about meeting Lemmy, but he wasn’t in. (There used to be a website, called something like Hall of Lamé, on which people would post their hugely anticlimactic stories about meetings or non-meetings with rock stars.) I wonder how I can have avoided a whole area of London for so long. Well, getting there is fiddly; it involves getting on the right kind of District Line train, always an anxious process, and then, I discover, getting the Overground. Which is like a weird cross between a District Line train and a real one. I’ve been on the Overground twice before in my life and on at least one of those occasions got horribly confused and agitated when it came to remembering whether one pushed the button to open the doors or not. The trains also come at very infrequent intervals, and you have to wait for them – the clue is in the name – above ground. Travelling down there hauls me, somewhat painfully, down memory lane. I’d heard some of John Hurt’s performance in Jeffrey Bernard Is Unwell a couple of days earlier and, as I may have mentioned once or twice before, he and I had a little history. It was when I lived in Earl’s Court; and I can date my departure from there to the day, because a few hours after I left, the 1987 hurricane happened and the fourth floor of the mansion block I’d been living in became the third floor; if I’d stayed there one more night, I’d have been killed by the masonry. Anyway, I get to my stop, Imperial Wharf, and look about me, and I recognise nothing. Instead of what used to be there – that is, a visible stretch of Thames, with boats on it – all I can see now is some kind of sanitised Ballardian mall, fake Georgian architecture nestling up to more unapologetically modern stuff, and in front of me an utterly typical car park. Such traces of individuality as the area may have had have been erased. It is remarkably dispiriting, and I have to call the dentist’s three times to get my bearings and point myself in the right direction, though Google Maps told me they were only three minutes’ walk away. Well, as it turns out, the dentist is not a lady keen on giving herself and her dental skills to me, but a nice man in (I suppose) his fifties with a picture of what looks like Stirling Moss in his Maserati 350S at some point in either the 1956 or the 1957 Mille Miglia. I can’t tell for certain, because the photo has been taken from behind. I am also distracted because I have been totting up the costs that would be involved in making my teeth sexy again. It comes to about a grand; and the chances of finding a spare grand are remote – as remote as finding a time machine that will take me back to 1987, or the keys to a Maserati 350S in the car park downstairs.

The Supreme Court is returning a transgender teenþÄôs case to a lower court without reaching a decision. The justices said Monday, March 6, 2017, they have opted not to decide whether federal anti-discrimination law gives high school senior Gavin Grimm the right to use the boysþÄô bathroom in his Virginia school. (AP Photo/Steve Helber, File) WASHINGTON – The Supreme Court is leaving the issue of transgender rights in schools to lower courts for now after backing out of a high-profile case Monday of a Virginia high school student who sued to be able to use the boys’ bathroom. The court’s order in the case of teenager Gavin Grimm means that attention now will turn to lower courts around the country that are grappling with rights of transgender students to use school bathrooms that correspond to their chosen gender, not the one assigned at birth. The appeals court in Richmond, Virginia, and other appellate panels handling similar cases around the country will have the first chance to decide whether federal anti-discrimination law or the Constitution protects transgender students’ rights. Monday’s action by a court that has been short-handed for more than a year comes after the Trump administration pulled back federal guidance advising schools to let students use the bathroom of their chosen gender, not the one assigned at birth. The justices rejected a call from both sides to decide the issue in a case that was dramatically altered by the election of President Donald Trump. Grimm’s case had been scheduled for argument in late March. Instead, a lower court in Virginia will be tasked with evaluating the federal law known as Title IX and the extent to which it applies to transgender students. Lawsuits involving transgender students are making their way through the courts in at least five other states: Illinois, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. For Grimm, the order means that he probably will graduate with the issue unresolved. Now, his wish to use the boys’ bathroom is blocked by a policy of the Gloucester County school board. Although he won a court order allowing him to use the boys’ bathroom at Gloucester High School, the Supreme Court put it on hold last August, before the school year began. Talking to reporters by telephone Monday, Grimm said the situation has added stress to the usual senior year worries of applying to college because the “school board has sent this direct message … that there is something about you that deserves to be segregated from the rest of the student body_” The court case has drawn attention from all over the world. Apple, IBM and Microsoft were among the 53 companies that signed onto a brief filed last week urging the court to rule in his favor. The high court action follows the administration’s recent decision to withdraw a directive issued during Barack Obama’s presidency that said which bathroom to use should be based on students’ gender identity. The administration action triggered legal wrangling that ended with Monday’s order. In essence, the federal appeals court in Richmond, Virginia, had relied on the Obama administration’s interpretation of Title IX to side with Grimm. The appeals court accepted the administration’s reading of the law without deciding for itself what the law and a related regulation on same-sex bathrooms and locker rooms mean. No appeals court has yet undertaken that more independent analysis, and the Supreme Court typically is reluctant to do so without at least one appellate opinion to review, and usually more than one. Another possible explanation for Monday’s order is that the court might want more of a societal consensus to develop before it issues a ruling in favor of transgender rights, said John Neiman, an Alabama lawyer who served as a law clerk to Justice Anthony Kennedy. “What happened today feels a lot like 2013, when the court used a procedural ruling to temporarily duck the same-sex marriage issue,” Neiman said. By 2015, same-sex marriage was back before the court and Kennedy’s opinion gave same-sex couples the right to marry nationwide. The court’s reluctance to take on transgender rights now may have been underscored by the high court vacancy caused by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia nearly 13 months ago and the refusal of Senate Republicans to consider Obama’s nomination of Judge Merrick Garland to fill the seat. Eleven days after taking office, Trump nominated Judge Neil Gorsuch for the court. Senate Republicans, who hold a slim majority, have scheduled hearings on Gorsuch’s nominations to begin on March 20 and hope to vote to confirm him by the second week in April. The justices did not comment on the case beyond their one-sentence order returning it to the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. — Associated Press writers Ben Finley in Norfolk, Virginia, and Sarah Rankin in Richmond, Virginia, contributed to this report.

And in some cases, the companies are indeed using AI to tackle problems that have much in common, particularly when it comes to making sense out of real-life sounds, images and dialogue. But a closer look shows that tech giants are at times not only tackling very different challenges, but employing different AI techniques to do so. IBM (IBM) , which has set a goal of obtaining $10 billion in annual revenue related to its Watson AI platform by 2023, is especially an outlier -- not seen as a leader when it comes to certain large-scale, consumer-focused AI solutions, but very much one when it comes to AI offerings that require a measure of industry-specific expertise. Big Blue's just-announced deal with cloud CRM software leader Salesforce.com (CRM)  showcases some of this expertise. The companies plan to pair Watson's ability to make sense out of data unique to fields such as health care, retail and financial services with Salesforce's Einstein AI platform -- it relies on the data taken in by Salesforce apps -- to deliver industry-specific insights, predictions and recommendations that can be useful for customer interactions. One such example given by the companies: By having Salesforce's Marketing Cloud apps plug into Watson programming interfaces (APIs), weather, local shopping and retail industry data analyzed by Watson could be paired with customer-specific shopping data analyzed by Einstein to "send highly personalized and localized email campaigns to shoppers." IBM also plans to provide companies with tools for integrating data from their on-premise and cloud apps with Salesforce's apps, and a solution from its Weather Company unit (acquired in 2015) that will let companies pull in weather data that can be used by Salesforce apps. A cited example: An insurance company using weather forecast data with Salesforce's Service Cloud (customer support software) to alert customers who could be affected severe weather events. Also as part of the agreement, IBM plans a company-wide deployment of Service Cloud. Given IBM did $80 billion in sales last year, it's safe to assume that this is one of Salesforce's larger Service Cloud deals. Though the Salesforce tie-up is one of the more prominent Watson partnerships IBM has announced, it's far from the only one involving a big-name company. Other notable partners include BMW (which uses Watson to analyze driving data), Medtronic (MDT) (it uses Watson to analyze data from medical devices for diabetes research), Cisco Systems (CSCO)  (offers joint solutions with IBM to analyze industrial IoT data and provides insights to users of Cisco's collaboration software), Twitter (TWTR) (Watson helps businesses analyze tweets to understand user sentiment and behavior) and General Motors (GM)  (Watson works with GM's OnStar telematics platform to provide personalized content and ads). In some ways, IBM is clearly casting a very broad net with its AI efforts, one that might only be matched by Alphabet/Google (GOOGL) . The company is likely able to do this in part because many of its AI projects are less resource-intensive than some of the top consumer-focused projects at other tech giants. Many Watson projects seem to involve running algorithms against specific datasets to classify and uncover patterns for different pieces of data. Since the algorithms get smarter/more accurate on their own as the amount of data they're run against grows, they're considered to be part of a branch of AI known as machine learning. A lot of the big AI projects at peers involve an advanced subset of machine learning known as deep learning. Here, algorithms -- often run against giant datasets -- attempt to mimic the behavior of neurons in a human brain to understand sounds, images and text as humans do. Deep learning projects, which often make heavy use of Nvidia (NVDA)  GPUs, underpin many of the efforts by Google, Facebook, Microsoft and others to offer things like voice assistant, photo-tagging and autonomous driving solutions to millions of consumers. IBM is investing in deep learning as well. But many of its Watson offerings appear to rely on other, less demanding types of machine learning. That, along with IBM's considerable industry-specific expertise, allows it to develop and run AI algorithms for a wide variety of enterprise use cases. There are some parallels here with IBM's 2014 deal with Apple  (AAPL) to develop iOS apps for verticals such as banking, retail and travel. Apple certainly isn't lacking in app development skills, but can't match IBM in providing the kind of domain-level expertise needed to create software for specific types of Global 2000 companies. Salesforce, which has invested heavily in its CRM-focused AI solutions, likely reached a similar conclusion about Watson's AI strengths. There is some risk that Google, Microsoft and possibly others could encroach more on Watson's turf in the future. Google, in particular, has talked about how many of its AI advances in areas such as image-analysis and natural language-processing are applicable to numerous Google projects. But for now, Watson is in a unique position as AI investments surge within the tech sector and beyond. Get an email alert each time I write an article for Real Money.

“No warning can save people determined to grow suddenly rich” – Lord Overstone Home Articles Authors Search About Us HOME / Articles / John Rubino / The Second Dumbest Kind Of Money Is Pouring Into S... The Second Dumbest Kind Of Money Is Pouring Into Stocks - 'With A Vengeance' By: John Rubino | Mon, Mar 6, 2017 Share Print Email One of the traditional signs of market tops is individual investors finally succumbing to the lure of apparently easy money and pouring their savings into the stock market. In the past this dumb money flowed into equity mutual funds in general. But today it's favoring exchange traded funds (ETFs) that, rather than trying to pick winners, simply offer exposure to sectors or broad market indexes. ETFs Race to Fastest Yearly Start Ever Based on Inflows (Wall Street Journal) – Investors poured $62.9 billion into exchange-traded funds in February, pushing the year-to-date world-wide tally to $124 billion, the fastest start of any year in the history of the ETF industry, according to data from BlackRock Inc. U.S. ETFs accounted for $44 billion of that, pushing assets in U.S. funds to almost $2.8 trillion. Most of the money went to cheap, index-tracking ETFs, a sign that the price war in ETFs isn't over yet. BlackRock's iShares ETFs were the biggest winner, and its low-cost Core series garnered the bulk of the $38 billion global haul. "All of the money is going into the cheapest and most boring ETFs. This is the retail investor getting back into the market with a vengeance," said Dave Nadig, chief executive of ETF.com, an industry website owned by Bats Global Markets, newly a subsidiary of CBOE Holdings Inc. The Rise of the 'Do-Nothing' Investor Passive mutual funds are growing rapidly, pushing aside stock pickers and changing the investment world. Click here to read more about The Wall Street Journal series. The fastest-growing ETF so far this year is the iShares Core Emerging Markets ETF, which took in $4.2 billion in the first two months of the year, 18% of its assets, according to FactSet. Three other Core ETFs that invest in U.S. stocks were also among the top gainers last month. Why is this a sign of a market top? Because small investors tend to trade on emotion rather than logic or expertise. It takes them a long time to forget the pain of the last bear market, so they avoid the early stages of recoveries. When they finally conclude that there's money to be made, it's usually too late. And why are individual investors only the second dumbest money? Because governments are even less astute and more emotional than individuals, and their plunge into equities is just beginning. Japan's central bank is now one of its market's biggest "investors" while the Swiss National Bank is a huge holder of blue chips like Apple and Microsoft. See We're All Hedge Funds Now, Part 4: Central Banks Become World's Biggest Stock Speculators. In the next downturn -- which, based on most valuation measures, seems imminent – the US Fed and European Central Bank will find that interest rates are too low for big further cuts while the supply of bonds is insufficient for big new QE programs. So they'll join Japan and Switzerland in buying stocks. They'll do so indiscriminately, creating their own index ETFs and throwing money at a broad range of large cap stocks, possibly pushing prices to levels that history would consider insane. In other words they'll act like retail investors on steroids. But that's a story for the next cycle. This time around the fact that individuals pouring in is all we need to know.     Tweet Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Coverage of Disruptive Science and Technology Forum About Contact Facebook twitter Google March 04, 2017 Hottest areas in Artificial Intelligence artificial intelligence, business, commercialization, economic impact, future Facebook Twitter linkedin google Reddit IDC sees widespread adoption of cognitive systems and artificial intelligence (AI) across a broad range of industries will drive worldwide revenues from nearly $8.0 billion in 2016 to more than $47 billion in 2020. According to a new Worldwide Semiannual Cognitive/Artificial Intelligence Systems Spending Guide from International Data Corporation (IDC), the market for cognitive/AI solutions will experience a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 55.1% over the 2016-2020 forecast period. "Near-term opportunities for cognitive systems are in industries such as banking, securities and investments, and manufacturing," said Jessica Goepfert, program director, Customer Insights and Analysis at IDC. "In these segments, we find a wealth of unstructured data, a desire to harness insights from this information, and an openness to innovative technologies. Furthermore, the value proposition of cognitive systems aligns well with industry executives' chief priorities. For instance, cognitive technologies are being used in the banking industry to detect and combat fraud – consistently a top industry pain point. Meanwhile, in manufacturing, executives cite improving product quality as a top initiative. In this case, cognitive systems recognize and know how to respond to dynamic fluctuations in product specs by adapting the production to stay within quality targets." The industries that will invest the most in cognitive/AI systems in 2016 are banking and retail, followed by healthcare and discrete manufacturing. Combined, these four industries will generate more than half of all worldwide cognitive/AI revenues in 2016, with banking and retail each delivering nearly $1.5 billion. Healthcare and discrete manufacturing will deliver the greatest revenue growth over the 2016-2020 forecast period, with CAGRs of 69.3% and 61.4%, respectively. Education and process manufacturing will also experience significant growth over the forecast period. Nearly half of all cognitive/AI revenue throughout the forecast will go to software, which includes both cognitive applications (i.e., text and rich media analytics, tagging, searching, machine learning, categorization, clustering, hypothesis generation, question answering, visualization, filtering, alerting, and navigation) and cognitive software platforms, which facilitate the development of intelligent, advisory, and cognitively enabled solutions. As both the largest and fastest-growing category, cognitive applications spending is forecast to reach $18.2 billion in 2020. Cognitive/AI-related services (business services and IT consulting) represent the second largest revenue category while hardware revenues (primarily from dedicated purchases of servers and storage) will grow nearly as fast as software with five-year CAGRs of more than 60%. Hottest AI technologies: 1. Natural Language Generation: Producing text from computer data. Currently used in customer service, report generation, and summarizing business intelligence insights.

  You are here: Home AI soon to be used daily: iFLYTEK's Liu Qingfeng By Guo Yiming 0 Comment(s)Print E-mail China.org.cn, March 7, 2017 Adjust font size: Liu Qingfeng, chairman of iFLYTEK [Photo by Guo Yiming/China.org.cn] A string of amazing breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) has provided conditions for its application in daily use, said the helmsman behind China's industry frontrunner on March 5. "The ever-evolving AI technologies combined with big data and industrial expertise will definitely change how people work and live in the next five to 10 years," said Liu Qingfeng, chairman of iFLYTEK and a deputy of the National People's Congress (NPC), during an exclusive interview with China.org.cn in Beijing. In his annual government work report delivered on March 5, Premier Li Keqiang expressed the government's steadfast support for emerging industries, saying that the country "will accelerate R&D on and commercialization of new materials, artificial intelligence, integrated circuits, bio-pharmacy, 5G mobile communications and other technologies." Chinese leaders are quite far-sighted in placing AI development at a strategic level, as the frontier industry is currently at a key stage of cut-throat competition, Liu said. AI's rise to the spotlight came after AlphaGo, Google's computer program, defeated the world's Go champion Lee Sedol in a historic five-game match last year, which wowed the world and prompted many established companies and startups to bet on the infant sector. The country's top three internet giants -- Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent -- (known as the BAT) have already announced their plans while pumping in huge amounts of money into the technology of the future. Looking outside of China, almost all tech giants like Apple, IBM, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook have joined the game. "With various core technologies on hand, massive databases, China's huge market as well as specializations in AI and voice recognition, iFLYTEK will definitely stand at the front line of the ever-growing market," said Liu. He cited the company's glorious victories over foreign rivals on multiple occasions including speech separation and recognition competition CHiME (Computational Hearing in Multisource Environments) and the translation competition Blizzard Challenge. The Shenzhen-listed company is developing a robot that will seek to beat 80 percent of Chinese students and become eligible, theoretically, for admission into a top-level university in 2020. AI technologies have already applied and will continue to expand their presence in education, translation, healthcare, information services, security, smart homes and others, he explained. "Chinese people are estimated to have made over 120 million overseas trips in 2016," Liu quoted from the premier's government work report. "Increasing outbound travel comes with people's increasing need for basic translation services in shopping, ordering food and asking for directions." With state-of-the-art technology in voice recognition, text translation and speech synthesis, the real-time translation device innovated by iFLYTEK can make cross-language communication available between Chinese and English, mandarin and Uygur as well as mandarin and Tibetan, he said. In the future, AI will replace over 50 percent of jobs and create new employment opportunities at the same time, said Lei Jun, CEO of Xiaomi Inc. He thinks that AI will create a new technology revolution and become basic social elements just like the internet in the coming years.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 7 March 2017 by Military News Pharma Digitalization at CPhI SEA in March JAKARTA, Indonesia, March 6, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — In two weeks’ time, from March 22-24, CPhI SEA is set to open its doors at Jakarta International Expo, offering to over 260 exhibitors the only dedicated pharma trading platform for the region. Sign up today! In a sprawling archipelago made up of 17,000 islands and sometimes difficult land connections, the digital revolution will soon transform the way people access healthcare. In the short term, the greatest disruption will come from telemedicine, facilitated by a growing array of apps that give patients direct access to GPS and subsequently order medicines for home delivery, directly on their mobile phones. Examples of local players already offering the service are Halo Doc, Apotik Antar, and Alo Dokter. Andy Richards, an investor in digital health, in the last issue of The Economist („A digital revolution in health care is speeding up”) argues that three groups are fighting a war for control of the „health-care value chain”. One group comprises „traditional innovators” — pharmaceutical firms, hospitals and medical-technology companies such as GE Healthcare, Siemens, Medtronic and Philips. A second category is made up of „incumbent players„, which include health insurers, pharmacy-benefit managers (which buy drugs in bulk), and as single-payer health-care systems. The third group are the technology „insurgents„, including Google, Apple, Amazon and a host of hungry entrepreneurs that are creating apps, predictive-diagnostics systems and new devices. In emerging economies, where regulations on health data are less onerous and where people often already expect to pay to see a doctor, faster growth and innovation is in the making. These and related topics will be discussed at CPhI SEA in 2 weeks’ time. Tailored to suit this fast–changing industry, the 6th edition of CPhI South East Asia, taking place during 22-24 March 2017 in Jakarta, provides the must-attend trade exhibition where the regional pharma industry meets to leverage connections, knowledge and insight to spur business. Sign up now to attend! Government supporters: Ministry of Health, Ministry of Industry, Indonesia Investment Coordinating Board, National Agency for Drug and Food Control Trade and Professional Organization Supporters: The Indonesian Pharmaceutical Association (GP Farmasi Indonesia), Pharma Materials Management Club (PMMC), International Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Group (IPMG), the International Society for Pharmaceutical Engineering (ISPE), and the Indonesian Pharmacists Association (IAI) Regional Supporters: Pharmaceutical Society of Singapore (PSS), Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers Association (PReMA) – Thailand, Malaysian Association of Pharmaceutical Suppliers. The CPhI series of events drives growth and innovation in the global pharmaceutical industry, with leading exhibitions and online communities covering every step of the supply chain from drug discovery to finished dosage. More than 100,000 visitors meet over 6,000 exhibitors at events in Europe, China, India, Japan, South East Asia, Russia, Brazil, Istanbul and Korea every year to exchange ideas, form alliances and conduct business on an international scale.

The future Expedia campus on Seattle’s waterfront. (GeekWire Photo / Taylor Soper) Expedia confirmed that it plans to keep at least a chunk of office space in its current hometown of Bellevue beyond the the timeline of its 2019 departure across Lake Washington with a final destination of the Seattle waterfront. The travel giant has agreed to extend a lease at a building called Skyline Tower in Bellevue to hold onto three floors of office space totaling 55,000 until at least 2022 with room for about 500 employees. Mark Nagle, vice president of global real estate and strategic sourcing for Expedia. Instead of a fixed office for certain teams or employees, the space will be available for employees to book for a certain amount of days per month, Mark Nagle, Expedia’s vice president of global real estate and strategic sourcing, said in a statement. “As is traditional with Expedia culture, we adjust over time to meet the needs of our employees,” Nagle said. “We found that there was a desire to keep some space on the Eastside as an option for employees as we transition to Seattle.” The new space will be much smaller than Expedia’s current footprint in downtown Bellevue, where it occupies more than 500,000 square feet in three office buildings. But still, it’s another good sign for the downtown office market, which just a few years ago was looking at as much as 20 percent of space becoming vacant with Expedia’s looming departure and a series of new buildings under construction. But news that Amazon is coming to downtown Bellevue, as well as a few other deals in recent years have filled up pretty much all the available big spaces in downtown Bellevue. In 2015, Expedia announced plans to re-locate its headquarters from Bellevue to Seattle, paying biotech giant Amgen $229 million for its prized waterfront campus on Elliott Bay. The company is trading in a vertical headquarters for a campus closer to the feel of a Google or Apple HQ that happens to be just minutes from downtown. Expedia will renovate the old Amgen lab buildings and build a couple new structures to accommodate its growing workforce. Originally, Expedia’s initial buildout plan included redeveloping four lab buildings on the former Amgen site and building a new 600,000-square-foot structure on the campus. That would give Expedia a total of about 1.2 million square feet when it moves in 2019. But the company on a quarterly earnings call over the summer said it is scaling back what it wants to have in place when the move occurs. The scaled back plan still includes redeveloping the existing lab buildings by 2019 but holding off on the new structure for now. Expedia has said it is focused on building out the space it needs for the 2019 move and will re-examine future needs later. Expedia also has eventual plans for “Phase II” and “Phase III” that could expand the campus to 1.9 million square feet and accommodate up to approximately 8,000 employees. These phases are part of a major phased development permit that Expedia is pursuing from the city, which looks at the campus over a 15-year timeframe. Initial designs for the campus were done by Bohlin Cywinski Jackson and GLY Construction is building it. Though the move raises Expedia’s cache locally by giving it a signature headquarters, it will also drastically increase the commutes of many employees. Nagle said Expedia emphasizes flexible work arrangements, so it’s possible that between working remotely and the new Bellevue office, some employees could be spared the commute. The decision to keep office space on both sides of Lake Washington has become increasingly common among tech companies looking to recruit top talent in the competitive Seattle area. Having offices on both sides of the lake gives companies access to a greater diversity of talent, both those who prefer the more urban experience of Seattle as well as the suburban workforce. Google was one of the first tech companies to invest heavily on both sides of the lake with offices in Seattle’s Fremont neighborhood and the city of Kirkland. Tableau Software, and most recently Amazon, are among the other big tech companies with presences in Seattle and on the Eastside.

With tech ready to go to bat, Supreme Court puts off transgender rights case Posted 8 hours ago by Taylor Hatmaker (@tayhatmaker) 0 SHARES Next Story Old-school social networks Tagged and Hi5 bought by MeetMe for $60M The Supreme Court announced Monday that it would vacate a lower court’s ruling in the case of Gavin Grimm, sending what was to be a landmark case on transgender rights back to the drawing board. The previous decision by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals drew on Obama-era guidance from the Department of Education stating that schools should treat transgender students in a way “consistent with their gender identity.” Because that same guidance was rescinded in late February — prompting a strong outcry from the tech community — the Supreme Court wishes for a lower court to first re-assess that decision. As the case neared the highest court in the land, a number of tech companies seized the moment to articulate their support for the transgender rights movement, a social issue that businesses appear increasingly willing to address. While transgender rights aren’t yet having their marriage equality moment, nearly all of tech’s biggest players have either signed on or otherwise weighed in on the issue, including Microsoft, Apple, Google, Facebook, Yahoo and Twitter. In Grimm’s case, that took the form of an amicus brief filed on behalf of 54 tech companies last week. Grimm, a transgender student in Virginia who was denied access to the boy’s restroom, has already become something of an icon in the struggle for trans rights. The Supreme Court was set to hear his case against Virginia’s Gloucester County School Board at the end of March. Depending on what is decided in the lower court, the case could make its way back up to the Supreme Court again, but that won’t be happening this term.

INN spoke with Jason Napodano, an analyst for BioNap, to discuss the key elements to look for when investing in small cap biotech companies. Napodano founded BioNap, an investment research site for companies in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical device sector. His work seeks to inform investors and work with companies to improve investment opportunities in the market. Last year INN Life Science wrote the best tools for investing in this area of the market are patience and research. “I think it’s a good thing the industry has gone through this reckoning … People are realizing that the only way to create value is by developing products that deliver benefit to patients,” Brad Loncar, founder of the Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy index, told Life Science Investing News for a story earlier this year. In this interview, Napodano details his 5C’s model, which he applies to all the companies he researches about. “Resource Forecast 2017 – Expert Opinions Covering Precious Metals, Energy, Critical Metals, and More” Click here to discover what the experts see coming in 2017 and beyond with our INN Insider's Report (value of $49) for FREE. Limited time offer. No credit card required. Get My Free Report Click here to download for free Investing News Network: First of all, how did you get into the business of investor education? Jason Napodano: I’ve been a professional stock analyst for 16 years. I’ve spent time previously at Zacks Investment Research, writing sponsored research with the company and I realized through my time there and through my time interacting with investors that there is a significant void of information on small cap biotech stocks. There are hundreds of small biotech companies and investors cannot always analyze all of those companies accurately or efficiently. There isn’t readily available information on all the companies, and there are still many differences in the science and the strategy between these companies that there is a market opportunity for somebody like me to help explain whether it’s the science or the finance, or the strategy, or helping investors sift through all the noise to determine what are the best stocks to invest in or what are the stocks that maybe should be avoided. INN: What makes a good company to invest in? JN: There are five components that I look for in a company, and I call them 5C’s: cash, catalyst, charisma, capital structure, and credibility. These five components allow a company to perform well or not, based on if they have enough cash to execute on their pipeline and to move forward and to not be constantly diluting investors through stock offerings. The capital structure is also very important because that’s how you value a company based on the shares outstanding and what potential dilutive instruments could come outstanding in the future. And so, companies that have clean capital structures tend to perform better than companies that have a messy capital structure, highly diluted capital structures or potentially toxic capital structures. Credibility is obviously very important–a biotech company has to have very credible management and has to have a management that can execute and get things done. Again, you’re betting on the science and you’re betting on the drug but there are people behind both of those, and when you’re putting your money into biotech stocks you really are betting on the management’s ability to get things done. It’s important that you invest in highly credible stories. Catalysts are probably the most important thing over the near-term that move stocks. Biotech stocks tend to trade on binary events. They are not so much focused on quarterly earnings, profit, or commercial updates, but they’re more focused on binary and pivotal updates from the FDA or from clinical trials. Biotech stocks need to have a reason to go higher or lower and that’s usually determined by whether or not the clinical trial hits or misses, and whether or not the FDA approves their drug or rejects their drug. It’s important for investors to understand that the catalysts drive that stock higher or lower, often with high volatility based on these binary events. The final component of my model is charisma, and that’s basically my review of the story, meaning: Does the science make sense? Is it a viable market opportunity, is it an unmet medical need, is it the kind of technology that has not only been patented for intellectual property but also is there a real place in the market based on the competitive position of the company? What other drugs are out there that do what this company is trying– or treat what this company is trying to treat and is it a viable commercial story from a logistics standpoint from a manufacturing standpoint? There are a lot of things that go into that final C of charisma, that I use my experiences as a biotech stock analyst for over 15 years to kind of determine whether or not it’s a good story. INN: In your website, you say that fundamentals drive stock prices. Could you elaborate on that? JN: Sure. The fundamentals drive stock prices in every industry. A story with good fundamentals is like Apple or Facebook–it is a company you want to invest in. A company with terrible fundamentals is probably a company you want to avoid. In biotech, fundamentals are basically the summary of the 5C’s that I previously mentioned. A company has to have good fundamentals, meaning the drug has to work, management has to execute, they have to have the cash and the financial ability to get things done, and they have to have essential milestones on the horizon that they can go to shareholders and say ‘we’re executing and we’re hitting these key points to drive this to essentially execute on our plan and drive the stock higher.’ So when I say fundamentals drive stock prices, what I mean is a stock with good fundamentals that likely scores high on this model will probably outperform a stock that has poor fundamentals. Poor fundamentals can mean the company has no cash, it has terrible capital structure, it has management that is unable to execute, or it just has a drug that doesn’t work. So fundamentals are kind of a catch for the 5 C’s story. INN: OK. All right thank you. Is there such thing as a perfect time to invest in a biotech stock? JN: You want to invest in a biotech stock, as I mentioned before, that has good quality science, has a competitive advantage, has intellectual property, and is targeting an unmet medical need. All of that goes into the charisma. Investors may want to find a good solid story from a science background and a market opportunity. Then it has to have cash–you never want to invest in a biotech company that is about to do a financing or is dangerously close to running out of cash. Then there are the catalysts–you want to invest in the company before the catalyst, whether or not you hold through the catalyst is a whole separate discussion, but there has to be a reason for that stock to go up if a biotech company is running a clinical trial. That’s the primary reason you’re investing in a company–because they’re running this clinical trial. If the clinical trial is going to offer results next month, now would be the time to invest, as opposed to a clinical trial that is going to offer results in 2019–in that case, there is absolutely no reason you should park your money in that biotech stock today, because there’s not going to be a whole lot to drive at higher between today and 2019. It’s not like your typical earnings story, your industrial company, your retail company, or your technology company that’s putting out quarterly results telling you here’s what our revenues are, here’s what we’re growing, here’s the product we’re bringing to the market. That’s not the way biotech companies work. Biotech companies work based on often binary events and so you want to invest ahead of those binary events if you want to capture the most outsized returns. INN: What do you think are the biggest challenges faced by biotech companies other than clinical trials failing? JN: I would say cash and their pipelines. I’d say the biggest challenge is the science and depending on what disease they’re targeting, making sure that you understand your drug. Not only what your drug does what you think and say it’s going to do, but how to design a clinical trial to prove that. I’ve witnessed many times throughout my career, drugs that I think work but clinical trials that have failed because they have not designed the trial to prove that their drug works effectively. It’s about the execution on the science, the regulatory, and the commercial aspect of their business. The other big challenge is the cash position. These biotech companies–almost all of them lose money, except for the very big ones. There are very large cap ones, but almost all of the small and mid-cap names lose money, so they are constantly in need of capital, whether it’s through public offerings with investors, private offerings, or through partnerships with larger pharmaceutical companies. Because there are so many publicly traded biotech companies, some of those–I think over 300–are all competing with each other for those dollars. Some of them will succeed and others will not based on their ability to complete financings. INN: Thank you, Jason. Don’t forget to follow us @INN_Resource for real-time news updates!

That is according to International Data Corporation (IDC), a tech research firm, which released its latest findings in the Worldwide Quarterly Wearable Device Tracker. IDC reported that a total of 102.4m wearable devices were shipped in 2016, up 25% year-on-year, as new vendors entered the market and established players refreshed their products. The report also noted that the market is evolving from single purpose devices into hybrid ones that fuse together multiple health and fitness capabilities with smartphone technology. "Like any technology market, the wearables market is changing," said Ramon Llamas, Research Manager with IDC's Wearables team. "Basic wearables started out as single-purpose devices tracking footsteps and are morphing into multi-purpose wearable devices, fusing together multiple health and fitness capabilities and smartphone notifications," he added. Looking at the top vendors, IDC confirmed that Fitbit maintained its dominance last year with 6.5m shipments in Q4 2016 and 22.5m over the whole year. Fitbit took 19.2% market share in Q4 2016, but this was down from 29% in Q4 2015 as the company faced serious competition from China's Xiaomi. Shipments of Xiaomi's wearables jumped 96.2% year-on-year to 5.2m in Q4 2016, giving the company a global market share of 15.2%. IDC said Fitbit faced one of its largest declines ever because it remained heavily focused on the US, a market which is quickly approaching saturation for fitness trackers. Apple, Garmin and Samsung accounted for the remaining top five vendors in Q4 2016. Apple secured 13.6% market share after its sales rose 13% year-on-year to 4.6m, which IDC attributed to the success of its Watch Series 1 and Series 2. Meanwhile, Switzerland-based Garmin secured 6.2% of the market with 2.1m shipments, while Samsung recorded strong year-on-year growth of 37.9% to 1.9m, giving the South Korean firm 5.6% market share.

The iPhone 7 which was originally selling for Rs. 60,000 for the 32GB variant is now available for Rs. 49999 for the same variant and the price changes apply for all variants all the way up to the 128 GB iPhone 7 plus which originally sells for Rs. 82000 but is now available for Rs. 71999. This also includes the Jet Black colour which was on high demand at the time of the launch of the iPhone 7. The deal however does not include the iPhone 7 Plus at 256 GB which still remains pricey at Rs. 92000. This news comes in wake of ever growing rumours of Apple’s next iPhone which, as a tenth anniversary upgrade, is expected to have some radical changes to design and technology. iPhone’s have usually never received price cuts in India, however, since this trend started in 2016, it has helped Apple move huge number of handsets and achieve record high sales for a phone segment which is now leads. This may possibly be the best time to grab an iPhone 7 and 7 Plus with the next upgrade a good 6 months away, your shiny ( or matte) iPhone can be bought for a good discount. The deal also appears to be a limited time offer. likethis What's your reaction?

Close share panel Image copyright Lisa Cope Image caption Lisa Cope has been unable to use her Jawbone since the summer of 2016 Owners of Jawbone fitness trackers are complaining on social media that the firm's customer support has vanished. At the time of writing, Jawbone's Twitter and Facebook support accounts had not been updated for several weeks. Some customers say their emails are not being answered either, and the UK helpline has a recorded message saying customer service is not currently available in the UK or EU. A spokesman told the BBC customer care is "days from being back online". He added that the firm was "in a process of transition". Lisa Cope shared an email she sent the firm in December 2016 saying she had been unable to use her Jawbone since the summer following various issues with the tracker not working properly and problems charging the device. She said she has not yet had a reply. "I loved the Jawbone until it stopped working," she said. "I thought it was a very good product and app, but had lots of flaws. I'm disgusted that they think they can just stop customer service even though they're still operational." Image copyright Jawbone Image caption Jawbone products are still widely available Rebecca Wire said her Jawbone Up2 was successfully replaced last year but the replacement is now being held together with gaffer tape and she has had no contact with the firm for over a month. Lisa Davidson said her new fitness tracker stopped syncing with her phone after five weeks and she has also been unable to contact Jawbone. "I regret not buying a Fitbit now," she told us. The firm is currently scoring 0.4 out of a possible 10 on company review website TrustPilot, with 170 reviews. Jawbone, once a popular fitness tracker brand, confirmed to TechCrunch in February that it intends to leave the consumer market and focus on healthcare providers. However its wrist bands are still widely available. The Up3 is currently on sale for £53.99 on Amazon in the UK. "I think Jawbone is not sure how to move forward," said Carolina Milanesi, analyst at Creative Strategies. "The mainstream consumer market right now is a cut-throat business and the high-end is controlled by Apple so looking at the medical sector might seem an option - but I am just not sure they have skills that would set them apart. "Jawbone might say they are coming back to wearables but it is hard to see how they could do that successfully. If they wanted to stop and regroup that was fine but we should have seen something by now."

This is set to change this year as the company shifts its focus to strengthen offline sales and to penetrate deep into the hinterland. As of today, Xiaomi ships its products to around 14,000 pin codes -- close to 40 percent of the country's total -- every single week. "This clearly highlights our presence in Tier 2 and Tier 3 markets. As we increase our focus on offline sales, we will further increase our penetration in these markets," Manu Jain, Vice President, Xiaomi, and Managing Director, Xiaomi India, told IANS. Xiaomi India reached three major milestones in 2016 -- it crossed $1 billion in annual revenue for the first time, secured a spot among the top three smartphone players in the country and, in October, sold a record 1.35 million smartphones. The feat, said Jain, was achieved after the company dedicated its first two years to building a strong operations and distribution network within the country to support an innovative product line. "We are now present in more than 8,500 stores via our innovative offline distribution network. Last year was indeed a great year and we achieved several milestones while building our India story," Jain added. Redmi Note 3 was the first device Xiaomi launched in India last year. By year-end, it sold more than 3.6 million units and became the highest shipped device in the history of online India. "It was followed by equally appealing devices which disrupted the markets in their own domain. In 2017, we will continue to launch more innovative products and new categories," Jain told IANS. Xiaomi launched Redmi Note 4 earlier this year and sold more than 250,000 units in 10 minutes in the first sale across mi.com and on India's e-commerce giant Flipkart. "With Redmi Note 4, we are hoping to sell more than double the quantity of Redmi Note 3. We are also working towards strengthening our support pillars such as after-sales and customer-support, among other areas," Jain added. According to him, the Indian industry is on the cusp of witnessing some key smartphone trends that will dominate this year. "We will see faster chipsets that will be able to run seamless applications, while also allowing consumers to multi-task. Apart from fast processing, these chipsets will also provide optimal power consumption from a single charge," Jain told IANS. Bezel-less smartphones will be the game-changer and more and more smartphone players will launch bezel-less display to enhance the overall viewing experience by providing a higher screen-to-body ratio. "Xiaomi launched Mi Mix in China last year which is bezel-less concept smartphone that features a screen-to-body ratio of 91.3 percent," Jain noted. With an upsurge in usage, the smartphone makers will focus on bigger battery which can handle long hours of LTE usage, multi-tasking and high-graphic games and video content. "As more consumers perform their everyday tasks on mobile phones, people require more storage space for multimedia content, applications and so on. Even mid-range smartphones will focus on providing increased storage space this year," Jain emphasised. With smartphones becoming more powerful, manufacturers will also explore the world of virtual reality. "In the year 2017, we will see even affordable smartphones that will have VR functionality," Jain added. If we look at its global performance, Xiaomi -- once touted as the "Apple" of China -- has slipped to fourth spot back home as the demand for its smartphones has declined. To reverse this, the company is now focusing on five core areas -- technological breakthroughs, new retail strategy, globalisation, artificial intelligence (AI) and Internet finance -- with a goal of $14.5 billion in revenue in 2017. But in India, the Xiaomi story is completely different and growing over country-specific, innovative products.

Xiaomi India to spruce up retail network for rural gains (Tech Trends) A look at Chinese smartphone player Xiaomi's current portfolio in India reveals that about 90 percent of its sales are from online channels, while less than 10 percent is offline. A look at Chinese smartphone player Xiaomi's current portfolio in India reveals that about 90 percent of its sales are from online channels, while less than 10 percent is offline. This is set for a change this year as the company is now focusing on strengthening offline sales to penetrate deep into the hinterland. As of today, Xiaomi ships its products to around 14,000 pin codes -- close to 40 percent of the country's total -- every single week. "This clearly highlights our presence in the Tier 2 and Tier 3 markets. As we increase our focus on offline sales, we will further increase our penetration in these markets," Manu Jain, Vice President, Xiaomi, and Managing Director, Xiaomi India, told IANS. Xiaomi India reached three major milestones in 2016 -- it crossed $1 billion in annual revenue for the first time, secured a spot among the top three smartphone players in the country and, in October, sold a record 1.35 million smartphones. The feat, said Jain, was achieved after the company dedicated its first two years to building a strong operations and distribution network within the country to support an innovative product line. "We are now present in more than 8,500 stores via our innovative offline distribution network. Last year was indeed a great year and we achieved several milestones while building our India story," Jain added. Redmi Note 3 was the first device Xiaomi launched in India last year. By year-end, it sold more than 3.6 million units and became the highest shipped device in the history of online India. "It was followed by equally appealing devices which disrupted the markets in their own domain. In 2017, we will continue to launch more innovative products and new categories," Jain told IANS. Xiaomi launched Redmi Note 4 earlier this year and sold more than 250,000 units in 10 minutes in the first sale across mi.com and Flipkart. "With Redmi Note 4, we are hoping to sell more than double the quantity of Redmi Note 3. We are also working towards strengthening our support pillars such as after-sales and customer-support, among other areas," Jain added. According to him, the Indian industry is on the cusp of witnessing some key smartphone trends that will dominate this year. "We will see faster chipsets that will be able to run seamless applications, while also allowing consumers to multi-task. Apart from fast processing, these chipsets will also provide optimal power consumption from a single charge," Jain told IANS. Bezel-less smartphones will be the game-changer and more and more smartphone players will launch bezel-less display to enhance the overall viewing experience by providing a higher screen-to-body ratio. "Xiaomi launched Mi Mix in China last year which is bezel-less concept smartphone that features a screen-to-body ratio of 91.3 percent," Jain noted. With an upsurge in usage, the smartphone makers will focus on bigger battery which can handle long hours of LTE usage, multi-tasking and high-graphic games and video content. "As more consumers perform their everyday tasks on mobile phones, people require more storage space for multimedia content, applications and so on. Even mid-range smartphones will focus on providing increased storage space this year," Jain emphasised. With smartphones becoming more powerful, manufacturers will also explore the world of virtual reality. "In the year 2017, we will see even affordable smartphones that will have VR functionality," Jain added. If we look at its global performance, Xiaomi -- once touted as the "Apple" of China -- has slipped to fourth spot back home as the demand for its smartphones has declined. To reverse this, the company is now focusing on five core areas -- technological breakthroughs, new retail strategy, globalisation, artificial intelligence (AI) and Internet finance -- with a goal of 100 billion Chinese Yuan ($14.5 billion) in revenue in 2017. But in India, the Xiaomi story is completely different and growing over country-specific, innovative products.

According to various device reviewers, the said controller sometimes would get disconnected from the Nintendo Switch. This has been a cause of a lot of frustrations to some users as the only solution thus far is a system reset. Nintendo, on the other hand, was quick enough to respond to the issue. However, instead of promising a possible fix, the company just effectively handed out instructions that may or may not alleviate the issue. For instance, Nintendo suggested keeping the Nintendo Switch away from any source of interference, aquariums, or under metal objects. The thing is, the first instruction alone is quite daft since interference is present pretty much everywhere. A Wi-Fi router, another Bluetooth device, or anything that generates radio signal can cause interference. Nintendo Switch JoyCon Controller image showing internal components (via ifixit.com) However, it would seem that the mystery has been finally been solved by the official teardown shown by the guys from iFixit. From the iFixit video, the Bluetooth antenna from the right JoyCon controller can be seen as a separate module. On the other hand, the left JoyCon has the Bluetooth antenna built right onto the controller board itself. The difference between the two are very striking since the right JoyCon Bluetooth antenna is set orthogonal or perpendicular to the nearest ground plane. Meanwhile, the left JoyCon antenna is the complete opposite as it lies parallel with the nearest ground plane. Unbeknownst to many, radio signals or radio waves have polarities based on the ground plane. They could either be perpendicular or horizontal, depending on applications. Signals that are perpendicular to a ground plane can traverse farther than the one that is horizontal or parallel. Seeing that the left JoyCon controller’s Bluetooth antenna is horizontally mounted, this could be causing the issue. On top of that, the user’s hand on the controller can serve as a dampener. Mainly because it absorbs some of the energy radiated by the Bluetooth antenna. Hopefully, Nintendo will issue a firmware update to correct this problem. At the moment, the only possible answer is by increasing the transmit power of the left JoyCon controller to compensate for signal losses. Unfortunately, Nintendo still has not issued any updates apart from the earlier instructions. For more updates on the Nintendo Switch, be sure to check out TheBitbag.

Google Pixel 2 coming – bite me, says Oreo 07 March 2017 Written by  Ray Shaw Published in ShawThing Twitter Google has confirmed that a Pixel 2 and XL model are in the pipeline for a September/October release and will be the first to run Android 8 – Oreo. At a roundtable discussion during Mobile World Congress, Rick Osterloh, Google’s senior vice-president of hardware, told Android Pit, “You can count on a successor this year, even if you don't hear a date from me now." Pixel lovers will be happy as Version 1.0 was very good, certainly in the top three handsets released in 2016 with a class leading camera – so it follows that version two will be even better. But in fine tradition do not expect a price cut as Osterloh also confirmed that “Pixel stays premium”. While the final form of the Pixel remains top secret, leaks have already been overflowing so here is what iTWire can reasonably confirm. First, let’s look back at the Pixel V1/XL. iTWire’s review in November 2016 stated “Good, but it could be great”. Its strong points included Pure Android with updates directly from Google (at the telco's mercy) and a great camera. But a few rough edges — no substantive IP rating, no microSD slot, and lack of user interface (customisation) — made it less than the device that could take on Samsung and others in the Android flagship market. Great hardware slightly let down by a lack of refinement in the software implementation. Typical forum comments were, “Never buy V 1.0 of anything”. I have regularly revisited the Pixel XL since and those rough edges that can be cured by firmware updates have been addressed. So, what do we need to see in V 2.0? The WOW factor Perhaps the biggest criticism of the Pixel was its lack of the WOW factor. The Pixel is a bland glass slab with thick antenna bands and rather thick bezels all around. To be fair, this format works best for its DayDream VR goggles so it is likely V2.0 will remain a similar shape and size. But ODM HTC has been perfecting new surface finishes and Google may go overboard with more “out-there” Google colours – it needs to stand out! Screen The Pixel XL 5.5”, 2560 x 1440, AMOLED screen is one of the better ones (along with the Samsung Galaxy S7) for VR. If Google increases the screen to body ratio it may see the Pixel go to 5.2” and the XL to 5.7” without a corresponding increase in body size. This won’t cause issues for VR. It is unlikely to adopt Samsung’s curvaceous Edge format but may increase the resolution given that the Snapdragon 835 processor can handle the power and resolution requirements. Audio Google’s twin downwards firing speakers may be fine for music but not for VR. It is likely that one will move back to the top for L+R stereo in VR use. Processor/RAM/Storage Pixel already uses the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 so it is highly likely to go to the new 835 which should have better availability later in the year. That raises an interesting point – Google designs and HTC makes the handset (which will continue) but its supply chain management was poor, resulting in shortages. Analysts say this was just as well, as these phones did not sell enough to meet anticipated factory orders. Android Oreo does not need more memory so the Pixel will stay with 4GB as a base, but the 32GB storage must increase – substantially. Google offered free, unlimited photo storage but that was not enough. Purists bemoaned the lack of microSD support so expect to see either 128GB as the base or 64GB and a micro-SD slot will return. Camera Pixel received the highest DXOMark of 89 in 2016 – one point up on the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge and Sony Xperia X Performance. Since then Huawei’s Mate 9 (rated 85 but in many tests rated higher than the Pixel) and others have upped the ante – not to mention that the yet to be released Samsung S8 and iPhone 8 are focusing on the camera too. iTWire’s review stated, “Pixel is an amazing 12.3MP camera that is beaten in some circumstances by either higher MPs, better or faster lenses, or better camera apps. But set it to auto, and it is probably the best all-rounder.” There is a strong rumour that the camera placement will be moved to the centre and it's likely to follow the dual camera route. In all other respects, the large pixel sensor, lens, and software are very good so expect only minor improvements. IP rating Google missed the mark last time so count on IP68 this time. Summary While Samsung and Apple are fighting to innovate in their next editions, it is more likely Google will simply incrementally improve what was arguably one of the better Android flagships of 2016. Its tick-tock cycle! There is a rumour of a smaller, cheaper “B” model but it does not fit with Google’s philosophy. You see, Google, despite the size and scope of its parent company Alphabet, does not want to dominate in handset sales. It cannot afford to annoy its legion of handset makers, so what you will see is Pixel become a niche, reference style product for purists. As long as it sells enough to warrant Google’s ongoing involvement it will be happy. That is exactly where the maker of Android should be.
